Rapper Meek Mill freed after uproar over harsh term
New York, United States | AFP | Rapper Meek Mill won freedom from prison Tuesday after an unusually harsh sentence triggered protests that pointed to racial biases in US probation laws.
The 30-year-old Philadelphia rapper, who was jailed in November over a case from their teenage years, was ordered out on bail by Pennsylvania's Supreme Court.
As they walked at least temporarily free, Mill thanked supporters who campaigned for them as well as the Philadelphia district attorney's office that sided with him.
“I understand that many people of color across the country don't have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues,” Mill wrote on Twitter.
“In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career,” said Mill, whose last album “Wins and Losses” reached number three on the US chart.
Mill, raised by a single mother after their father was killed, was thrown into jail over their arrest on drug and gun possession charges in 2008, well before the rapper born as Robert Rihmeek Williams achieved stardom.
At what had looked like a routine hearing, Philadelphia judge Genece Brinkley handed Mill a term of between two and four years for violating terms of parole, including scheduling shows that conflicted with the court schedule and entering a publicized scuffle in St. Louis.
Ordering Mill out on bail, the state's Supreme Court cited “credibility issues” over a police officer who was a witness.
Mill has said they were badly beaten during the 2008 arrest and placed a bloody mugshot of themselves as the cover of their “DC4” mixtape.
The Supreme Court did not throw out the case but asked the local court to reach a resolution within 60 days. It also did not remove Brinkley but noted they “may opt to remove themselves from presiding over this matter.”
In addition to street rallies, Mill enjoyed the support of celebrities including hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, whose Roc Nation management signed Mill.
In an op-ed last year for The New York Times, Jay-Z said that Mill's case was “just one example of how our criminal justice system entraps and harasses hundreds of thousands of black people every day.”
Probation, which dates from English common law, was initially seen as a compassionate way for courts to grant freedom to people who pose little risk.
But a survey by The Marshall Project, a non-profit news organization that covers the US judicial system, found that at least 61,250 people — and probably far more — are in prison across the United States for minor parole violations like missing appointments, failing drug tests or staying out past curfew.

Comedian Hannibal Burress has been arrested on a disorderly intoxication charge after getting into a heated argument with cops in Miami.
Burress, 34, was arrested on Saturday at about 10.30pm, police said. Police said they became belligerent when they refused to call an Uber for him, and refused to leave a nearby bar when they told them they were too drunk to remain. The comedian was booked into Miami-Dade jail at 1.57am on Sunday and posted bail of $500 shortly before 6am, court records show.
A video shows them arguing with arresting officers in a slurred voice.
“Am I under arrest? For what?” Buress yells in the video, handcuffed and leaning against a patrol car.
“Explain what I'm detained for. What I am detained for?”
The officers advise them that they suspect them of trespassing, although no trespassing charge was later filed against him.
“You know y'all goofy as f**k,” responds Buress. “You don't have probable cause for anything and you're hella stupid right now.”
The officer eventually loses patience with Buress and firmly guides them down into the back seat of the radio car. The comedian's friends can be heard in the background jeering and heckling the officers as they complete the arrest.
The incident began when Buress approached the cops and demanded that they call an Uber for him, according to charging documents reported by TMZ.
Police said that Buress, who had blood shot eyes and a strong odor of alcohol coming from their breath, became angry and belligerent at their refusal. The funny man then entered a nearby bar and refused to leave when the officer told them they were too drunk to remain, cops said.
Buress hurled profanity and insults at the officer, causing a crowd to form, and refused orders to leave five times before they were handcuffed, according to police.
Buress is best remembered for a 2014 stand up routine that made reference to persistent allegations of sexual misconduct against Bill Cosby. After cell phone video of Buress' bit went viral, multiple women went public with allegations that Cosby had drugged and raped them decades ago.

LFTZ: Catalyst for real estate market, urban growth
The United Nations projects that Nigeria's population will cross the 250 million mark by 2030. An estimated 10th of this figure will live and work in Lagos in an estimated area of 356,861 hectares of which 75,755 are wetlands. To the Lekki Free Zone (LFTZ), this presents development opportunities for real estate developers. Through the LFTZ, the host communities are also being transformed into a new haven for the upwardly-mobile. MUYIWA LUCAS writes.
About a decade ago, Mr. Anthony Konyeaso, an engineer, declined an investment offer in real estate in Ajah area of Lagos State. Their refusal to buy a plot of land in that region then was quite understandable given the difficulty of accessing the area and infrastructural deficit in the region.
But things are changing now on the axis. Just about a month ago, Konyeaso became the last of a close circle of eight friends, all middle-aged professionals, to relocate from Surulere to Ibeju-Lekki axis of the state.
The group typifies a slow but growing exodus of middle-income earners from the Lagos Mainland to Island communities, now considered affordable to either build or rent residential apartments. Such movement is being hastened by the relief of commuting along this corridor, which hitherto posed a hydra-headed problem for residents and workers on the Lagos Island.
The rush
“The major works done by the state government on the Lekki-Epe Expressway has reduced the traffic congestion that used to be a problem for people living after Ajah,” explained Konyeaso.
This, they further explained, is why several undeveloped estates in that area have suddenly experienced rapid development of houses. Besides, they noted that houses that used to be unoccupied in the area were now being filled as more people move in.
Indeed, such is the rush to the Ibeju-Lekki corridor for realtors and other property owners, now positioning for the mega opportunities offered by the axis. While many see the area as the ‘new Lagos', Konyeaso is convinced that the stimulant for the surge in real estate development in the region is based on the Lekki Free Trade Zone (LFTZ).
Their position on this may not be wrong. For any gigantic project comes with several opportunities. The LFTZ, an ambitious 16,500-hectare business hub, is a joint venture between the state government and private investors. It is expected to create an estimated 300,000 jobs and significantly boost the state's gross domestic product (GDP).
LFTZ investments
According to the Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Rotimi Ogunleye, the net value of infrastructure at the zone stands at $4 billion. They also revealed that 116 investors had registered with the zone; with 16 already operational. “The Lagos State Government has, in the last two years, released N698.47 million as part of the state's equity contribution to the joint venture,” they said.
To further boost its commitment to the project, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode last March pledged to accelerate financial commitments to the zone. And to match their words with actions, Ambode announced an additional $62 million funding to be released to the project over the next six months. This is to be borne by the government and the China Africa Lekki Investment Limited, one of the partners on the project. The government's commitment to start work on the Lekki Deep Sea Port as well as critical roads in the zone has been welcomed by investors in the zone and this is expected to accelerate investments going on in the zone. Dangote Group, which is the biggest private investor in the zone, is said to have invested about $4 billion in its refinery, fertiliser processing plant, gas pipeline project and a petro-chemical plant projects so far.
Rising estate development
The massive scale of these projects has already spurred a spike in real estate value within the Ibeju-Lekki axis as developers scramble to provide housing to the estimated 1,000 workers on the projects. During a business luncheon in Lagos, the Nigerian Institute of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV) urged its members to take advantage of the opportunities in the zone by investing in real estate development within the area.
“The times are very exciting for us as real estate developers and residents here because we cannot even stop dreaming of the opportunities it will bring to this area when completed. At present, our property business is on the upswing, so can you imagine what it will be like when the LFTZ is operational?” asked Sunday Michaels, a developer in one of the estates along the corridor.
They admitted that the opportunities, such as the growing real estate development in the Ibeju-Lekki region, had been triggered by the potential of the LFTZ. Besides, Michaels explained that “traffic is easier; the air seems cleaner here; and, most importantly, everyone is talking business opportunities that may arise because of the zone''.
However, experts warned that there was work to be done to sustain the excitement in the zone and ensure that the objectives were realised. The proposed sea and airports as well as access roads to the zone, were critical to the success of the project. The objective of free trade zones is to spur manufacturing and export of such goods to boost the contribution of goods exports to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
The Lagos Free Zone is expected to be Nigeria's biggest example of this. Ambode has so far shown that they realise this and is committed to facilitating these critical enablers. “It is clear that we have to dualise the Lekki-Eleko Road beyond the zone to withstand the influx of vehicles that will be making use of the road to access the zone. With this, we will be able to sustain the investments in the area,” they say.
Needed expertise
While the zone, undoubtedly, presents immense opportunities to all stakeholders, it has also faced criticisms from experts as being too undefined. This is an area that the state government and urban development investors in the zone are working to address.
One of the private investors in the zone, Rendeavour Nigeria Limited, which specialises in unique satellite city concepts, seems to have shown promise on what real estate development should be in such areas.
The firm, a force in Africa's urban land development, has invested in about 30,000 acres across Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is, therefore, instructive that Rendeavour has committed to developing 1,000 hectares within the LFTZ, with provision of critical infrastructure that would further aid urban development in the axis.
Alluding to the efforts and initiatives of their firm, Rendeavour's Head of West Africa Operations, Mr. Yomi Ademola, said the firm's efforts in other countries where testify to its credibility. They explained that a 5,000-acre city in Tatu, Kenya being handled by the firm is the country's second largest project. The project, they explained, has attracted thousands of residents as well as foreign firms looking for manufacturing area in well-developed and managed spaces.
“In Nigeria, specifically in Abuja and Lagos, we plan to replicate what we have done elsewhere, which is to invest in helping create world-class infrastructure that will help sustain and accelerate economic growth, meet the aspirations of a burgeoning middle class and serve as a catalyst for urban development,” Ademola added.

Jozi's New ‘Parking Police' Are Taking The Piss Out Of ‘Jackass' Drivers [Image]
Parking tickets suck, but for many South Africans they're the kind of thing you bundle up in a ball and forget about.
What if the ticket called you out for parking like a jackass, though? Ah, we struck a nerve…
Over the past few weeks somebody has been driving around Jozi and telling it like it is, printing “you park like a jackass” notices and sticking them on offending vehicles.
Times LIVE snapped a picture of one such notice, and I think it's a message we can all relate to.
I'm especially fond of the ‘how you can fix this' section down the bottom:
Stop visiting public places – cool, you don't have to ask me twice.
The notices first popped up last week at the Linkwood Hospital, plonked on two windscreens in the parking lot.
The hospital has distanced themselves from the issue:
“We do not condone behaviour of this kind and would certainly never have sanctioned the use of such signs on our premises. We have alerted the security team at the hospital and they will be on the lookout for anyone posting notices on vehicles in our parking area,” said Netcare Linksfield and Linkwood hospitals general manager Louis Van Der Hoven.
Did they also alert the fun police? You have to have guts to stick up signs like these, because if some ‘roided up monster saw you in action there would be hell to pay, boet. According to Automobile Association spokesperson Layton Beard, two wrongs don't make a right: “If you feel that someone has parked extremely badly, and that you really feel that you need to do something about it, I would advise that you contact the security personnel of the mall or wherever you are and highlight this,” Beard said. Beard said sticking an offensive note on someone else's car should never happen. “Two wrongs don't make a right. You are not the traffic warden. You are not in an official capacity and we absolutely advise you against it.”
Always remember that two wrongs don't make a right, but two Wright's did make an aeroplane.
I'll let myself out.

HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Tom Morgan, a past owner of the R.L. Winston Rod Company whose quest to build flawless fly fishing rods continued long after they were paralyzed by multiple sclerosis, has died. They were 76.
Morgan died of pneumonia Monday in a hospital not far from their home, said Matt Barber, who bought Morgan's company, Tom Morgan Rodsmiths, earlier this year with Joel Doub. For the past five months, Barber and Doub have been Morgan's apprentices in Morgan's home workshop west of Bozeman to learn how to craft perfect bamboo, graphite and fiberglass rods.
''Tom's legacy will be that they really brought modern rod building to the forefront, and a lot of their designs at Winston will be remembered forever,'' Barber said.
Morgan's philosophy was to make the best fly rod possible, regardless of cost - every detail, fit and finish had to be perfect, Barber said. While other fly rod manufacturers were producing stiffer rods that are forgiving when handled by beginner anglers, Morgan created full-flex rods that acted almost as an extension of the arm of experienced fly fishermen.
They described themselves to Rodmaker Magazine in a 2003 interview as ''totally uncompromising.'' If they spotted a scratch or a blemish, the rod wouldn't be sold.
''You'd think that since I couldn't go fishing I'd lose interest in it, but it's always been a pursuit of perfection,'' Morgan told CBS News in 2014. ''I know that I provided thousands of people with great enjoyment in their favorite sport. It almost brings tears to my eyes.''
Morgan was born in 1941 in Hollywood, California, and five years later their family moved to Ennis, Montana, along the Madison River, renowned as a blue-ribbon trout stream. Their parents ran a hotel that was frequented by avid fly fishermen, and they started guiding anglers at age 15.
They were a guide for 14 years, which they said helped them learn how some rods worked better than others.
But Morgan had only built one rod before buying San Francisco-based R.L. Winston Rod Company in 1973 with a friend he'd guided with. They moved the company to Twin Bridges, Montana, where Morgan pursued their craft for 18 years and turned the company into a renowned rod maker.
They sold their stake in Winston in 1991 and opened Tom Morgan Rodsmiths in 1995 so that they could continue crafting rods without the pressure to produce more at the expense of quality.
By that time, they were suffering from multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. They were in a wheelchair, and their wife, Gerri Carlson, became theirs hands.
Morgan and Carlson worked together to transform their designs into rods out of their home west of Bozeman, not far from where they grew up in Ennis.
They turned out a limited number of exquisite rods, about 125 a year, purchased by anglers across the globe. That perfection comes at a cost - a bamboo rod sells for just under $4,000 while graphite and fiberglass rods can cost up to $1,500.
Doub and Barber bought the company in February after agreeing that they would keep the company in southwestern Montana and that they would stay true to Morgan's philosophy and not ramp up production to sell greater quantities of rods.
Barber said Morgan was working right until they had to be rushed to the hospital Friday, studying how different rods bent and looking at new bamboo rod prototypes.
Carlson said their husband had a belief in the universe, and their place in it, though they were not a religious man.
''The nurse told us the night before they died that they said, 'I'm ready to climb to the stars,''' Carlson said.
Barber said plans are being made to hold a memorial in Ennis next month.
Magic Leap just announced a preview of its software development kit and "creator portal," which will offer resources for people who want to build for its yet-unreleased Magic Leap One headset . You can now download a preview build of the Unreal or Unity engines, designed for what Magic Leap dubs "spatial computing." This is one of Magic Leap's juiciest announcements, marking one of the secretive company's first steps toward establishing itself as an open platform. It also may be a sign that the company is finally close to releasing hardware. The Verge reports:
A Cuyahoga County grand jury has decided not to charge two Cleveland officers in the death of Tanisha Anderson.
Officers Scott Aldridge and Bryan Myers responded to a call from the family in 2014 while Anderson suffered a mental health episode. Anderson, who suffered from heart disease and bipolar disorder, died after being taken down and restrained in handcuffs.
The county medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. But the state Attorney General's office ordered a second autopsy after a county judge discovered the examiner had partially based their findings on an internal police investigation.
The family's attorney, David Malik, says the entire process took too long and lacked transparency.
A drawn-out process
"The investigation went to the coroner who had information that should have been kept private," Malik said. "And then to realize after the fact they had information they shouldn't have had, and to have to start the process over again, was maddening for everyone involved, but mostly for the family.
The city of Cleveland last year reached a $2.25 million settlement with the family. It's now up to the city to decide if it will take any disciplinary action.

Steven Neilson enjoyed a day to savour, grabbing 5-5 as Langley were bowled out for 81.
Chris Mann then smashed 66 not out to steer Marsden home in quick time.
Ushaw Moor's promotion ambitions were hit by the abandonment of their game against visitors Silksworth.
The home side won the toss and elected to bat, making 156-6 in 27 overs before the rain brought an early end to proceedings.
Opener Peter Maddison hit three fours and four sixes in a run-a-ball 68, supported by Mike Thorpe's 43 off 44 balls, with five fours and a six. Aaron Proud added three fours in a 24-ball 26.
Kumar Navarathnam was the pick of Silksworth's bowlers, grabbing 2-46, while Paul Brigham took 2-58, Robbie Jones 1-25 and Paul Dixon 1-26, the big wicket of Maddison.
Lowly Silksworth took eight points, with Ushaw Moor securing seven.
Evenwood were 127-5 when their match with Ryhope was abandoned. Owen Peddelty scored 41 for the home side, while Ryhope bowler Sagar Udeshi had taken 3-16.
Hylton never made a start in their home match against front-runners Crook at the Billy Hardy Complex.

Virgin Mobile will stop signing up new customers and upgrading plans on 15 June, Optus revealed today. The telco said it would begin the process of closing down Virgin Mobile retail stores “shortly” — with all locations to be shut down by the end of June.
Last week Optus revealed it would phase out the Virgin Mobile brand over the next two years.
“As they are already connected to the Optus network, Virgin Mobile customers can continue to use their service in the same way they always have,” said Optus managing director, marketing and product, Ben White
“We have a special transition plan in place to make sure the impact to customers is minimal, and the experience they have during this time is a positive one.”
Shutting down the brand affects some 200 employees and 36 stores.
Yesterday Optus revealed it would also be cutting 400 positions.
“Optus is making a step-change to the way we work, do business and fund future investments so we can continue to thrive in our increasingly competitive and disruptive market,” an Optus spokesperson said.
“As we make these important strategic decisions, we will ensure we have the right skills and capabilities in place to build our digital organisation, remove duplication and establish a more sustainable cost base.”
Virgin Mobile Australia launched in 2000. Optus was originally a part owner but in 2006 took over the brand. The decision to phase out the Virgin brand was the result of a strategic review by Optus.
The Virgin Mobile brand licence is due to expire in 2020, according to Optus.
As the federal government pushes forward with Barnaby Joyce's white elephant political legacy of a $10 billion inland rail line, overlooked is the extent to which subsidised coal exports will play a key role in the finances of the project.
Despite using optimistic demand scenarios, the government has been unable to conjure a business case for the inland rail line, which will ostensibly connect Melbourne and Brisbane via central New South Wales, albeit stopping at Acacia Ridge in outer Brisbane, with a connection to the Port of Brisbane not slated until the 2040s. According to the business case prepared in 2015 by rail infrastructure owner Australian Rail Track Corporation for a committee headed by former Nationals leader John Anderson, the inland rail project as a whole will wipe out $6.5 billion in taxpayer funding over its life, with total revenues less than half of the cost of building and operating the line, and assuming there are no blowouts and delays to construction.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — One of Jason Day's goals at the start of the year was to stay at No. 1 for the entire calendar year. The year is not even two months old, and already they are facing their first big challenge.
And not just from one player.
Dustin Johnson, coming off a third-place finish at Pebble Beach, and Phoenix Open champion Hideki Matsuyama both have a mathematical chance to reach No. 1 in the world by winning the Genesis Open at Riviera. Johnson would need Day to finish around fourth or worse, while Matsuyama could reach the top only by winning and Day finishing about 25th or worse.
Tiger Woods in 2009 was the last player to start and finish a year at No. 1.
Rory McIlroy was the last player to stay at No. 1 for longer than a year, starting with their victory at the 2014 Bridgestone Invitational and ending when Jordan Spieth passed them with a runner-up finish in the 2015 PGA Championship.
Just don't get the idea Day is consumed with the ranking.
"I said earlier that a calendar year would be great to go No. 1, but I need to just focus on what I need to do because you can't really focus on staying No. 1," Day said. "The more you focus on the actual target itself, the more you attach yourself to it, you make mental errors out there, you get more frustrated, you do silly things on the golf course that you shouldn't be doing."
Johnson also had a mathematical chance to get to No. 1 last week, but they would have had to win Pebble and have Day finish out of the top 50. Day tied for fifth. Johnson also had a chance at the PGA Championship last summer, but they missed the cut and Day was runner-up.
Day doesn't have a lot of history at Riviera. The only reason they are playing is because of the tour's new "strength of field" regulation that requires most players to compete at an event they haven't been to in four years.
Their best finish is a tie for 62nd.
They keep reminding themselves that they didn't have a great history at Bay Hill and The Players Championship, and they won them both last year.

DAVE MUSGROVE: The European Tour lost another legendary caddie when Dave Musgrove died Monday at age 74.
Musgrove and Dave Renwick, who died last year, are the only caddies to work for three major champions. Musgrove was on the bag when Seve Ballesteros won their first British Open in 1979. They worked for Sandy Lyle when the Scot won the Open in 1985 and the Masters in 1988, and they were alongside Lee Janzen when they won their second U.S. Open title at Olympic Club in 1998.
Musgrove renewed their partnership with Janzen in 2001 so that they could caddie in their 40th consecutive British Open.
Among the many players paying tribute on Twitter was Lyle, who said, "We wrote history together at The Open, The Masters and The Players Championship. We'll miss your humour and your stories."
___
NICKLAUS TRIBUTE: The end of the Masters coincides with the start of Golf Channel's latest project, a three-part series on Jack Nicklaus.
The Golf Films project is called "Jack," and it will air over three straight nights in prime time starting at 9 p.m. on April 9. It will feature nearly 100 interviews and hundreds of hours of archived film.
"'Jack' is a project that Golf Films has spent years developing in order to comprehensively capture the career and legacy of golf's most accomplished champion," said Mike McCarley, president of golf for the NBC Sports Group.
The first part will be the early part of their career, including the relationship with their father, meeting their wife and early success. The second part will look at the their playing career, highlighted by their 18 major championships. The final part looks at their legacy in the game, from the priority they placed on family to their golf course design and work with Nicklaus hospitals.
It is being produced by Israel DeHerrera, who also produced the three-part series on Arnold Palmer that was broadcast in 2014.

RACE FOR MEXICO: The first World Golf Championships event is around the corner in Mexico City, and this week will start determining who gets there.
The field will be determined by the top 50 in the world ranking after this week. Thomas Pieters (No. 47) and Shane Lowry (No. 51) are among those playing the Genesis Open at Riviera, which has the strongest field of the year so far.
The tighter race is the FedEx Cup standings. The top 10 after the Honda Classic will be exempt. Hudson Swafford at No. 8 and Gary Woodland at No. 11 are separated by only 61 points with two weeks to go. Rod Pampling, currently No. 10, has not played in a WGC event since 2009.
On the European Tour, Pablo Larrazabal is holding down the 10th spot. They have to stay there at the end of this week to make the Mexico field.
Much like Chinese players in the HSBC Champions in Shanghai, the WGC-Mexico Championship is reserving a spot for the highest-ranked Mexican player. That would appear to go to Roberto Diaz, who lost in a playoff on the Web.com Tour last week in Colombia. That enabled Diaz to move from No. 719 to No. 462. They currently are 36 spots ahead of the next Mexican player, Rodolfo Cazuabon Jr.
Among those playing the Web.com Tour event in Panama this week who could pass Diaz are Carlos Ortiz and Abraham Ancer.

BODY LANGUAGE: Hideki Matsuyama doesn't always look happy with their golf shots, even when they turn out well. Such was the case at the Phoenix Open, when the Japanese star would finish with one hand on the club only for the ball to finish in reasonable range for birdie, or their shoulders would slump and the ball would split the middle of the fairway.
"Sometimes how you're playing and the results don't coincide," Matsuyama said. "So for me, when I do a one-handed finish, to me it's a missed shot. It's just the result was good."
When they were jokingly asked if they did that to confuse the television announcers, Matsuyama smiled and said, "No. That would be fun."

DIVOTS: Jordan Spieth's nine PGA Tour victories have come at eight tournaments. The only place they repeated was the John Deere Classic. Tiger Woods did not win the same PGA Tour event until their 10th victory at the 1999 Western Open. ... The first team event on the PGA Tour since 1981 will have official prize money, but not world ranking points. The Official World Golf Ranking board denied a PGA Tour request to offer points at the Zurich Classic this year. ... Charles Howell III has had 46 finishes in the top 10 since their last PGA Tour victory at Riviera 10 years ago. ...

JOHNSON CITY, TN (WJHL) – While Wellmont Health System added employees in 2016 compared to 2015, Mountain States Health Alliance reduced its total number of employees by 5%, the equivalent of 470 positions, according to recent tax filings.
A MSHA spokesperson says at the end of 2016, the system employed 8,150 people, which is compared to the 8,620 employees listed on the organization's most recent tax filing at the end of 2015.
MSHA Chief Financial Officer Lynn Krutak says the organization hasn't had any reductions in force, but has eliminated non-essential positions, mainly through attrition. Krutak says as the health system is faced with declining reimbursements, management is focused on running a lean organization and eliminating any unnecessary expenses.
“We haven't reduced any clinical staff,” they said. “We've reduced some of the overhead staff, again as we continue to look at every area where we might be able to reduce expenses. There have been some people, but it's mainly the result of attrition. We haven't had any reduction in force. We do that through turnover.”
A spokesperson says MSHA has hired 760 people so far this year and currently has 426 open job postings, some of which include multiple positions. MSHA did not release a year-to-date number of employees.
Wellmont reports it employed 6,254 employees at the end of 2016, which was up from 6,106 the year before, according to recent tax filings.

For the second time ever, Wisconsin had five players earn some form of All-American recognition from the Associated Press.
Considered the most prestigious All-American team, the AP selected linebacker T.J. Edwards to the first team, running back Jonathan Taylor and tight end Troy Fumagalli to the second team and guard Beau Benzschawel and tackle David Edwards to the third team.

Edwards becomes the first defensive player from Wisconsin since Erasmus James in 2004 to earn first-team honors. They finished the regular season second on the team in tackles with 75, including 11 tackles for loss. They added two sacks and tied for the team lead in interceptions with four.
Earning second-team honors, Taylor joins Ron Dayne as the only true first-year student running backs from Wisconsin to be named to any team by the AP. With one game to play, Taylor has rushed for 1,883 yards and 13 touchdowns.
Named the Big Ten Tight End of the Year, Fumagalli earns second-team recognition from the AP after leading Wisconsin with 43 catches for 516 yards.
Benzschawel and Edwards started all 13 games at right guard and right tackle, respectively, for the Big Ten West Champions. They helped Wisconsin produce the second-best rushing attack in the conference at 229 yards per game.
The Badgers will take on Miami on Dec. 30 in the Orange Bowl.

With mail-in voting for the June primary set to begin in two weeks, the race for governor of California is narrowing.
Two Democrats, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, lead a crowded field for the state's top elected position, with 21 percent and 18 percent of support respectively, according to an Eyewitness News/Southern California News Group poll conducted by Survey USA and released Tuesday.
But the poll also shows that the top Republican in the field, John Cox, draws 15 percent support, putting them within striking distance of finishing in the top two in June and advancing to the general election on Nov. 6.
All three candidates are building specific coalitions, the poll found.
Newsom is backed by suburban residents with college degrees, self-described liberals and, as former mayor of San Francisco, many residents of the Bay Area, according to the poll of 520 likely primary voters.
Villaraigosa is supported by many Latinos and pulls strong backing from lower-income residents, women and residents of Los Angeles.
Cox, a business person and radio personality who lives in Rancho Santa Fe, is backed by whites, conservatives and men.
Five other gubernatorial candidates were mentioned, including Republican Travis Allen (10 percent) and Democrat John Chiang (9 percent). The poll, which focused on people likely to vote in the June primary, found 17 percent are undecided.
The online poll, conducted through Monday, also shows that U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein has enough support (39 percent) to put them on track to win the June primary, and that Republican Patrick Little has enough backing (18 percent) to be the current No. 2 in that race.
If both candidates make it to November, 84-year-old Feinstein, seeking their fourth term in the Senate, would be a strong favorite in Democrat-heavy California.
The polling – which reached 916 registered voters, including 520 who said they are likely to vote in June – also shows that Californians are divided on the use of National Guard troops to help secure the border, a recent point of debate between California Gov. Jerry Brown and President Donald Trump.
About 30 percent say guard troops should be sent to the border and, once there, they should prevent people from crossing the border illegally, a policy favored by Trump.
Another group, 36 percent, say guard troops should go to the border, but only to focus on crime, drugs and gangs, the policy enacted by Brown.
A third group, 27 percent, say guard troops should not go to the border at all.
The poll also found strong opposition to a plan to carve California into three states. More than 7 in 10 voters (72 percent) said California should remain a single state. The idea, known as CAL3, will appear on the November ballot.
The East Baton Rouge metro council voted 8-2 to levy a tax that will benefit the Council on Aging (COA). Voters approved this tax back in November of 2016.
The tax was for 2.25 mills. The council failed to adopt the tax back in mid-April, and several council members walked out of the meeting in anger, causing the vote to be delayed for 60 days.
"I've never seen anything like this at the city council level,” said Rep. C. Denise Marcelle. “It should have never been so contentious.” Marcelle, who also sits on the COA board, says it was a no-brainer and that they are surprised it took council members so long to approve the tax.
The metro council also expected to get an update from a Baton Rouge Police Department spokesperson on the status of the officers involved in the shooting death of Alton Sterling, as well as an update about the 911 call from that night from EMS officials.
However, due to how much time was spent discussing issues related to the COA, the Sterling items were not addressed.
Some say they believe the council intentionally delayed those items.
"I'm very disappointed, but it was expected that they were going to draw the time out and that's why when I went to speak about the tax, I brought up the Alton Sterling situation and video," said Arthur “Silky Slim” Reed, a community activist.
While the metro council meeting was dominated by the COA vote, on what would have been Sterling's 38th birthday, family members gathered for a balloon release outside city hall. They say they do not want their loved one to be forgotten.
"It felt good to see those balloons go up in the air and in remembrance of Alton,” said their aunt, Sandra Sterling. “Today was their birthday and it just felt good."
Sterling's aunt, Veda Washington, says they are truly happy about the victory for area seniors, but they won't give up fighting for justice for their nephew.
"I'm very excited for them I'm going to go home and cry. If I keep talking to you I'm going to cry, but it's not hard,” said Washington. “I'm happy for them because they deserve this and then some."
"Nothing else can hurt this family, so this family has weathered the storm and will continue to be on the front lines for justice for Alton,” Reed added.
The current COA building on Florida Blvd. is in bad condition. Prior to the vote, heated words were exchanged between Rep. C. Denise Marcelle and EBR councilman, Dwight Hudson.
“You made mention that it could have been used for drainage project. I just want to remind you that the money was approved for LMI, which is low to moderate income, during Gustav and Ike, and it has to be spent, a plan has to be in place by July 15,” said Marcelle.
“There is a way to do it, but I appreciate your comments,” said Hudson.
“OK, I appreciate you, but I just want to warn the council about spending money that the federal government has allocated for one thing and using it for another,” Marcelle replied.
“We made the decision to give this money to the Council on Aging and regardless to anything else, they need the building. We have invested a whole bunch of money in it already and of course this money could have been used for something else. We considered all of that when we voted on it. We decided to use it for that purpose and to do it differently now, it would not be a right thing to do,” said EBR councilwoman, Donna Collins-Lewis.
The council also voted to levy a 2 percent tax on hotel/motel rentals in the North Baton Rouge Development District, as well as measures for the metro council to have more oversight over the COA, requiring them to submit quarterly financials, video recordings of their meetings, and more training for their staff.
The full meeting can be watched below.

HUNTINGTON BEACH – Whether they're battling each other for a Trinity League title or matching up in a tournament, Servite vs. St. John Bosco has become one of the premier wrestling rivalries in the CIF Southern Section.
The Friars and Braves matched up again in the championship round of the CIF-SS Coastal Division Duel Finals on Saturday at Marina High.
This round went to St. John Bosco, which defeated Servite in eight of 14 weight classes on the way to a 34-22 victory.
Servite finishes as CIF Coastal Division Runner-Ups! Congrats Fight'n Friars! #credo pic.twitter.com/FX051blxYh — Servite Wrestling (@FriarsWrestling) February 4, 2018
The Braves and Friars, who were seeded No.1 and No. 2, respectively, were meeting in the finals of the tournament for the second time in the past three years.
Only 11 teams showed up for what was scheduled as a 16-team tournament.
“You've got No. 1 and No. 2 going at it and both of us have beaten everybody else in the Southern Section,” Servite coach Alan Clinton said. “They are one of the best programs around.”
The Braves got victories from Antonio Lorenzo (113 pounds), Cleveland Belton (126), Sonny Santiago (138), Luis Rojas (152), Beltran (160), Michael Beltran, Nathan Haas (170) and David Aranda (220). Christian Nunez (120) won by forfeit.
Servite's winners included Andrew Silva (106), who won a major decision over Justin Valdoria, Mario Cazarin (132), who won 4-2, over Cael Valencia and Daniel Jurardo (182), who defeated Adam Nold 11-5.
The Friars' Tristian Wilson (195) scored a late takedown to defeat Jaden Patterson 5-3, and heavyweight Zander Wilson won by forfeit.
“There wasn't a bad match out there,” Clinton said. “Every match was a pound and go.”
The Braves, who are ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section, reached the finals by defeating Trabuco Hills 72-12 and then winning 73-6 over Valencia in the semifinals.
Servite, ranked No. 1 in Orange County and No. 5 in the Southern Section, defeated Godinez 72-6 and Villa Park 61-18 to reach the finals.
Several Braves and Friars will likely meet again in the finals of the Trinity League individual championships on Friday, Feb. 9.
The teams have had some memorable matches in the Trinity League.
In 2016, the Friars came from behind, winning six consecutive bouts, to defeat the Braves 38-23. A year earlier, St. John Bosco edged Servite 37-29, to take the league title.
In 2014, also with the title on the line, Servite pulled out a 35-29 victory over the Braves in a match that came down to the final bout.

(Reuters) - The web hosting company GoDaddy said on Sunday it had given The Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider after the extremist web site posted an article denigrating the woman who was killed at a white nationalist rally in Virginia.
"We informed The Daily Stormer that they have 24 hours to move the domain to another provider, as they have violated our terms of service," GoDaddy posted on its official Twitter page.
The Daily Stormer post in question denigrated Heather Heyer, 32, who was fatally struck by a car allegedly driven by a man with white nationalist views, for their physical appearance and what it said were anti-white male views.
The Daily Stormer is a neo-Nazi, white supremacist website associated with the alt-right movement, which was spearheading the rally on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia which resulted in violence, including Heyer's death.
GoDaddy, founded in 1997 and based in Arizona, has some 6,000 employees worldwide.

In the race to commercialize a new type of powerful computer, Microsoft Corp. has just pulled up to the starting line with a slick-looking set of wheels. There's just one problem: it doesn't have an engine — at least not yet.
The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is competing with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, International Business Machines Corp. and a clutch of small, specialized companies to develop quantum computers — machines that, in theory, will be many times more powerful than existing computers by bending the laws of physics.
Microsoft says it has a different approach that will make its technology less error-prone and more suitable for commercial use. If it works.
On Monday, the company unveiled a new programming language called Q# — pronounced Q Sharp — and tools that help coders craft software for quantum computers. Microsoft is also releasing simulators that will let programmers test that software on a traditional desktop computer or through its Azure cloud-computing service.
The machines are one of the advanced technologies, along with artificial intelligence and augmented reality, that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella considers crucial to the future of their company. Microsoft, like IBM and Google, will most likely rent computing time on these quantum machines through the internet as a service.
D-Wave Systems Inc. became the first company to sell a quantum computer, back in 2011, although its technology has been controversial and can only perform a certain subset of mathematical problems. Google and IBM have produced machines that are thought to be close to achieving “quantum supremacy” — the ability to tackle a problem too complex to solve on any standard supercomputer. IBM and startup Rigetti Computing also have software for their machines.
Microsoft, in contrast, is still trying to build a working machine. It is pursuing a novel design based on controlling an elusive particle called a Majorana fermion that no one was sure even existed a few years ago. Engineers are close to being able to control the Majorana fermion in a way that will enable them to perform calculations, Todd Holmdahl, head of Microsoft's quantum computing efforts, said in an interview. Holmdahl, who led development of the Xbox and the company's HoloLens goggles, said Microsoft will have a quantum computer on the market within five years.
“We are talking to multiple customers today,” they said, “and we are proposing quantum-inspired services for certain problems.”
These systems push the boundaries of how atoms and other tiny particles work. While traditional computers process bits of information as ones or zeros, quantum machines rely on “qubits” that can be a one and a zero at the same time. So two qubits can represent four numbers simultaneously, and three qubits can represent eight numbers, and so on. This means quantum computers can perform calculations much faster than standard machines and tackle problems that are way more complex.
Applications could include things like creating new drugs and new materials or solving complex chemistry problems. The “killer app” of quantum computing is discovering a more efficient way to synthesize ammonia for fertilizer — a process that currently consumes 3% of the world's natural gas, according to Krysta Svore, who oversees the software aspects of Microsoft's quantum work.
The technology is still emerging from a long research phase, and its capabilities are hotly debated. Researchers have only been able to keep qubits in a quantum state for fractions of a second. When qubits fall out of a quantum state they produce errors in their calculations, which can negate any benefit of using a quantum computer.
Microsoft says it uses a different design — called a topological quantum computer — that in theory will create more stable qubits. This could produce a machine with an error rate from 1,000 to 10,000 times better than computers other companies are building, Holmdahl said.
Reducing or correcting the errors in quantum calculations is essential for the technology to fulfill its commercial potential, said Jonathan Breeze, a research fellow working on advanced materials at Imperial College London.
The lower error rate of Microsoft's design may mean it can be more useful for tackling real applications — even with a smaller number of qubits — perhaps less than 100. Svore said their team has already proved mathematically that algorithms that use a quantum approach can speed up machine learning applications substantially — enabling them to run as much as 4,000 times faster. (Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence behind recent advances in computers' ability to identify objects in images, translate languages and drive cars).
“We want to solve today's unsolvable problems,” Holmdahl said, “and we have an opportunity with a unique, differentiated technology to do that.”

GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) - The Latest on the train derailment (all times local):
2:30 p.m.
Norfolk Southern says it is moving derailed freight cars off the tracks after two trains collided in Georgetown, Kentucky.
The company said in a statement on Monday that four train crew members taken to the hospital after the crash as a precaution have been released with no injuries, though one employee is still being evaluated.
Officials say the trains collided head-on late Sunday, derailing both locomotives and 13 cars. Lexington Fire Department spokesperson Lt. Jessica Bowman said nearby residents were evacuated as a precaution, but were allowed to return home once officials determined there was no safety risk.
Norfolk Southern said it is working to clear and repair the track and have it back in service Tuesday.

Four people were injured after two trains collided and derailed in, Georgetown, Kentucky.
Lexington Fire Department spokesperson Lt. Jessica Bowman told The Associated Press early Monday morning that a call came in at 11:14 p.m. on Sunday to report the accident.
Bowman says the residents near the scene were evacuated "out an abundance of caution" because something spilled after the collision and there was a fire. They said they could not confirm what spilled but once officials determined there was no safety risk they allowed residents to return home. The fire has been extinguished.
Bowman says the identities and the condition of the four injured is not yet known.
Georgetown is 13 miles (21 kilometers) north of Lexington.

Residents evacuated after a train derailed in neighborhood have been allowed to return home.
The train derailed in Georgetown late Sunday night, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) north of Lexington.
The superintendent of Scott County Schools, Kevin Hub, told The Associated Press early Monday morning that there is a plan in place to have the district open schools to shelter residents in case of an emergency. They say they were called by Georgetown police and told to put the plan in motion.
WLEX-TV reported that Scott County Emergency Management Captain Robert Duncan said buses were sent to evacuate residents living in trailer parks near the scene to an elementary school.
They said the evacuation was a precaution due to a potentially hazardous material. They could not identify what the material was.

RENTON, Washington (AP) — Outspoken Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett has been a supporter of Colin Kaepernick this offseason in their attempt to land a job in the NFL.
Bennett's support wasn't enough for their team to sign Kaepernick. But the fact the Seahawks brought Kaepernick in for a visit was worthy of acknowledgement considering the silence he's received from the rest of the NFL, Bennett said.
"I don't know what the factors were in (why) the Seahawks didn't sign him," Bennett said. "I know the Seahawks were the only team to step up and give them an opportunity to do a (visit). That says a lot about the organization. I think our organization is built a lot around community.
"If you look at the way the Seahawks move, if you look at the way our team moves, if you look at the people that work in the building this organization is built around community. I'm not surprised that the Seahawks were one to look at Kaepernick and give them an opportunity even to try out."
Bennett was in full support of their franchise on Wednesday during the second day of Seattle's minicamp, from their praise for considering Kaepernick to coach Pete Carroll's reasoning why the Seahawks didn't sign the quarterback.
"If they feel that this is not the right situation because we have a starting quarterback, then that's their choice," Bennett said. "I think he's able to have that choice because he's shown that he's of a winning pedigree. They want to make sure they don't have that competition behind their quarterback, I think it's justifiable."
Bennett skipped Seattle's OTAs earlier in the offseason, working out on their own and spending time with their family, but didn't want to risk any fines for missing the mandatory minicamp. Bennett also said Wednesday he's been in contact with Kaepernick through the offseason in an attempt to help the former San Francisco quarterback with some of their initiatives.
Never one to hold back an opinion, Bennett said there is no logical explanation for why Kaepernick doesn't have a job at this point.
"There is obviously the elephant in the room why Kaepernick isn't signed," Bennett said. "I've said this several times and I'm not afraid to say it, I think race in politics and sports is something that people don't want to hear about, nor do people want to be a part of.
"I think if you bring the issue of oppressed people onto a stage where there are millions of fans watching, bring up dirty little secrets, I think a lot of people don't want to hear that. People just want to see people score touchdowns and make big hits."

In their first few months in office, Mnangagwa lived up to their strong anti-corruption billing by arresting a coterie of politicians fingered for abuse of office and misappropriation of funds.
But despite the early high profile anti-corruption hype, the new dispensation has recorded no convictions in trials of the allegedly corrupt government officials.
In fact, most of the officials nabbed on graft allegations are now out on relaxed bail conditions, with some having had their passports returned, including permanent secretaries accused of graft.
Mnangagwa has been forced to establish a special anti-corruption prosecution unit based in their office, unsatisfied with the slow pace with which anti-corruption matters are being handled, and to placate those who accuse their administration of pursuing a vindictive blitzkrieg targeting rivals.
Meanwhile, chilling warnings made to individuals and corporates accused of externalising foreign currency have come to nought, more than two months after the expiry of the March 19 deadline.
Stephen Chan, a professor of world politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London, said anti-corruption drives rarely succeed.
“Any country with many people at senior level suspected of corruption will mean that corruption is part, not just of the system of government, but the culture and structure of government,” they said.
“There is a transition period where government just won't work if all corrupt people are purged — as there will not be enough people left. Also, in Zimbabwe, the ruling elite is a tight group, bound by party ties, kinship ties, and liberation ties. Everyone knows how to steal and everyone knows someone who will know how to turn the heat down if they are caught,” Chan told the Daily News.
“Also, as in Kenya and Nigeria, no one believes there is an actual anti-corruption drive — when almost all the elite drive luxury cars, live in Borrowdale Brook, have farms, and carry Louis Vuitton briefcases — so no one is actually disappointed when all the smoke and thunder fade and no one important is convicted. If the president is serious, they will have to wait till after the elections, hoping they have a strong enough electoral mandate to attack corruption.”
Piers Pigou, senior consultant at the International Crisis Group, said an absence of resources, skills and unconditional political will to create a formidable anti-corruption capacity remain the primary obstacles.
Pigou said corruption was a notoriously difficult crime to prove, which requires enhanced focus on related crimes of fraud and racketeering.
They said Zimbabwe needs a truly independent anti-corruption capacity that is free from political interference, one that is accountable to Parliament and not the Executive and has a protected budget.
“There also needs to be greater coordination between the various agencies working directly and indirectly in this field, including the office of the Auditor-General,” said Pigou.
“The announcement of yet another body housed inside the presidency may be well-intentioned, but it does not inspire confidence, especially in a context where there are repeated concerns raised about the partisan focus of investigations.”
Regarding the millions of dollars funnelled outside the country, Mnangagwa's spokesperson, George Charamba, told the Daily News that Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mangudya had just given Mnangagwa an update suggesting a new approach to deal with those who externalised money and assets.
“We faced a very basic problem and I will be very honest with you. Mangudya came back to the president and said; one, I think there must be consideration of the fact that most of these cases occurred at a time when the economy was in a tumultuous state, and what we are considering as misbehaviour, unlawful behaviours on the part of body corporates were in fact existential choices at the time,” said Charamba.
“So, Mangudya said I prefer an approach where — considering that the offending parties are forthcoming — they prefer an approach where they engage, but where this route does not yield a result, they will come back to the president and ask them to invoke their other whip,” they told the Daily News.
“And if you notice from the update last week, more monies are trickling in. So really, it means that engagement is bearing fruit and the president was very clear, they said ‘well, John, you have put your honour on the line, what I want is the robbed economy to receive back its money. You said you prefer persuasion, I give you the chance to use that, but it means it's your honour now that is on the line'.”
Charamba said when Zacc was created, there was no corresponding re-engineering of institutions in a way that would make sure the commission rests on the feet of related institutions.
“We had a very strange situation where you have a constitutional commission called Zacc but which is de-linked from the police force, which is de-linked from the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), which is de-linked even from the President's Office.
“You have to make sure that in its interface with all those bodies, it is not surrendering its independence. What we are trying to do is to make it more effective,” said Charamba.
Explaining the use of presidential decree to set up the special unit, Charamba said they could not go back to Parliament to have Zacc reframed “because that takes long but what you can then do is create some institution within that allows those inter-linkages using Executive powers.”
But political analyst Maxwell Saungweme said taking the corruption prosecutions from the NPA to the presidency was not only illegal, “but a political phantasmagorical ploy aimed at shielding the presidency and close associates from anti-corruption scrutiny.”
They said Mnangagwa's anti-corruption drive had inherent bottlenecks and challenges as everyone around them had their hands in the cookie jar.
Saungweme said fighting endemic corruption using tainted hands, fouled institutions and defiled systems only happens in fiction movies.
“At best such anti-corruption calls by a tainted administration is just useful as electoral political banter, in an election year,” Saungweme told the Daily News.
Academic and fierce-pro-Mnangagwa loyalist and newspaper columnist Reason Wafawarova said they do not think the special unit can replace a constitutional commission.
“I think there is a general belief that the NPA is compromised, just like many of our institutions. However, a new unit in ED's office could be viewed as a political outfit set to politicise the justice system. It's a tricky situation.
“ED's political will to fight down corruption has to gain legal momentum because people are not arrested, charged, tried and convicted politically. That happens at law,” they said. DailyNews
Egypt parliament agrees island transfer to Saudi Arabia
Egypt's parliament approved on Wednesday a controversial maritime agreement with Saudi Arabia that transfers two Red Sea islands to the kingdom, state television and a lawmaker said.
The deal, which is still under challenge in court, had sparked rare protests in the country with the opposition accusing the government of selling Egyptian territory to its Saudi benefactors.
The vote came after days of heated debate in parliament with opponents even interrupting one committee session with chanting.
Courts had struck down the agreement, signed in April 2016, but a year later another court upheld it.
Lawyers are now challenging the deal before the constitutional court.
The accord had sparked rare protests in Egypt last year, with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi accused of having traded the islands of Tiran and Sanafir for Saudi largesse.
The government has said the islands were Saudi to begin with, but were leased to Egypt in the 1950s.
Opponents of the agreement insist that Tiran and Sanafir are Egyptian.
On Tuesday evening dozens of journalists protested against the agreement in central Cairo, before being dispersed by police, journalists' union official Gamal Abdel Rehim told AFP.
Several were briefly arrested before being released but “three reporters are still detained, and contacts are being made with the interior ministry to get them released,” they said.

The 2017 tax act demonstrates a continued effort to create jobs in the manufacturing industry. The act eases tax burdens on manufacturers, both corporate and non-corporate, and increases the threshold at which small manufacturers can use preferable accounting methods. While manufacturers do lose a much cherished deduction, increased expensing and reduced tax rates should more than make up for the loss.
Deductions and Credits
Taxpayers may immediately expense the full cost of qualified property acquired and placed in service before 2023 (“bonus depreciation”). The act removes the requirement that taxpayers are the original user of the property so long as the property is not acquired from a related person or entity. This additional expensing is set to phase down 20% every year after 2023, and ultimately is set to expire after 2027. The act also expands “§179 expensing” allowing taxpayers to immediately expense up to $1 million of the cost of certain depreciable assets acquired and placed in service in the tax year. The amount available for immediate expensing is reduced by the amount which the cost of the assets exceeds $2.5 million. Unlike the changes to bonus depreciation, the changes to §179 expensing are indexed to inflation and not set to expire.
Not all news is good news, and the same goes for tax news. The act repeals §199 – the deduction for domestic production activities. While the act retains the research and development tax credit, it requires the capitalization and amortization of research and experimental expenses over 5 years (15 years if the expenses are attributable to research outside of the United States). On a positive note, the capitalization and amortization requirement does not go into effect until 2022.
Corporate and International Concerns
Manufacturers organized as corporations will see a much lower effective tax rate in 2018, with the corporate tax rate reduced to a flat 21% and the corporate AMT repealed. Manufacturers that were subject to the corporate AMT in prior years will be able to use the prior year minimum tax credit to offset their liability, with a portion of the credit refundable from 2018 through 2021.
For multinational manufacturers, the act imposes a mandatory “repatriation” tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Taxpayers will be subject to a tax of 15.5% on cash (or cash equivalents) and 8% on illiquid assets and may elect to pay the tax over 8 years.
The “Pass-Through Deduction”
Owners of pass-through entities engaged in manufacturing are likely to see a significant benefit from the new deduction for qualified business income (QBI). QBI is generally the net of ordinary business income and deductions effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, with some limitations. Like the familiar §199, new §199A is limited by taxable income, this time 20% of the individual's taxable income. Taxpayers are eligible for a deduction of the least of their combined qualified business income or 20% of their taxable income. Combined qualified business income is the least of 20% of the allocable share of QBI or the W-2 wage limitation. The W-2 wage limitation is the greatest of (a) 50% of the allocable share of W-2 wages paid or (b) 25% of the allocable share of W-2 wages paid plus 2.5% of the allocable share of unadjusted basis of all qualified property. This second category permits manufacturers with lower payrolls to take advantage of the deduction. The W-2 wage limitation does not apply to individual owners with taxable income of less than $157,500 ($315,000 if filing jointly).
The deduction is set to terminate for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025.
Accounting Method Reforms for Small Manufacturers
Manufacturers have generally been required to keep inventories and the accrual method of accounting. Only small manufacturers with 3-year average gross receipts of less than $1 million were exempt. While the IRS provided relief several years ago for taxpayers with 3-year average gross receipts of less than $10 million, it explicitly omitted manufacturers from such relief. The act increases the 3-year average gross receipts test to $25 million (indexed for inflation) permitting any taxpayer who meets the test to use the cash method of accounting, account for inventories as materials and supplies that are not incidental, and exempt such taxpayers from the uniform capitalization rules.
Conclusion
Though the effects of tax changes vary business by business and taxpayer by taxpayer, the industry overall should see a reduced tax bill. Whether individual manufacturers use that reduction to create jobs remains to be seen.

This bias can be costly. Teams that chose to avoid the 2-point conversion won the game only 40 percent of the time, which is well below the average rate of successful 2-point conversions (about 50 percent). Surely some of those teams should have known they were underdogs if the game went into overtime, and mistakenly avoided a risk they should have taken.
This error is not limited to the N.F.L. We also looked at all instances in the past five years in which teams in the National Basketball Association trailed by 2 points with less than 24 seconds to play. In this situation, a team can attempt a 2-point shot that would send the game to overtime or try a (more difficult) 3-point shot that would win the game immediately.

Again, a clear bias emerged: Of the 772 instances in which teams faced this situation, they avoided the 3-point shot 71.1 percent of the time.
This bias appears to be costly in the N.B.A. as well. The teams that attempted the 3-point shot won the game more often (17.3 percent) than those that attempted the 2-point shot (14.5 percent).
Basketball fans in a laboratory environment make this same mistake. In one study, we asked participants to imagine that they were the coach of an N.B.A. team that was down by 2 points in the final seconds. Just as N.B.A. teams did, our participants avoided the superior strategy, opting for the 2-point shot 81 percent of the time.
Why do people make this error? Part of the explanation lies in our tendency to treat problems in isolation rather than as part of a larger whole. Just as investors often mistakenly evaluate stocks individually rather than as part of a portfolio, coaches and fans often evaluate decisions in terms of their immediate impact and give less consideration to how those decisions fit in the larger context of the game.
In our laboratory study, we found that whether participants opted for the 2-point or 3-point shot was unrelated to their beliefs about how the team would perform in overtime. They made their decision by focusing almost entirely on the prospect of losing immediately, neglecting how the future was likely to play out.

But there is more to the story than myopia. People also seem to be unnecessarily wary of risks that they feel they are choosing to take (as opposed to risks they feel they are forced to take).
In a study that highlights this point, we asked football fans to imagine that a team had scored a touchdown in the final seconds of a game. Then we told half the fans that the team trailed by 1 point and the other half that the team trailed by 2 points. We then told all the fans that the team was going to attempt a 2-point conversion.
Those who were told the team was down by 1 point (and thus had the viable option of kicking the extra point to force overtime) thought the 2-point conversion was more likely to fail than did those whose team had to attempt a 2-point conversion just to force a tie. That is, the same decision was thought to be riskier when it was seen as optional as when it was seen as unavoidable.
“Live to fight another day” is often a good rule of thumb, but it is not always the best strategy to pursue. Good judgment, in sports and elsewhere, sometimes requires the presence of mind to take the risk of an immediate setback to achieve lasting success.
Flu kills 13,000 birds as Kano farmers lament unpaid compensation by government
The Kano State Ministry of Agriculture yesterday confirmed that the avian flu influenza, otherwise known as bird flu had killed no fewer than 13,000 birds in nine farms across the state.
The Federal Government had raised the alarm of possible outbreak of the disease in seven states of Kano, Katsina, Kaduna, Bauchi, Nassarawa, Plauteau and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.
Besides, the fresh outbreak of bird flu in Kano came amidst farmers' agitation against unpaid compensation, which has accumulated for two years.
Director of Veterinary Services in the ministry, Shehu Bawa who disclosed the development told The Guardian that the number of fresh casualties only accounted for cases officially reported and documented at the ministry.
Shehu, who said the affected farms had since been depopulated to check further spread, insisted that the increase in the number of affected birds was due to the late notice it received from the farmers.
They pointed out that the state government in collaboration with the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) has begun a surveillance of farms and marketplaces to decontaminate suspected cases of the disease.
Meanwhile, Secretary of Poultry Farmers Association (PFA), Umar Kibiya Umar lamented the failure of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to settle a backlog of compensation to farmers who had lost millions of birds to earlier outbreak of the scourge.
Umar said poultry farmers had suffered huge losses to the deadly disease without intervention from government in recent times.
Their words: “The last time we received compensation in Kano was in 2015 and that was made in part payment and no money was paid in 2016, let alone the recent cases. In 2015 and 2016, 136 farms were affected in which over 1 million birds were lost.
“To set the records straight, the Federal Government paid N330m as part payment in 2015, leaving N437m to balance our members for the two years.
They said the Soviet International and Anadariya farms, among others, were badly affected two years ago.

The German automaker is trying to see what happens when you let a computer learn how to write, space and spell on its own. The experiment could help researchers build an artificial brain for a car that could independently deduce and react to what's happening on the road. It might seem like these things are unrelated, but a typewriter cranking out sentences and a car automatically braking to miss an object in the road are both utilizing to learn and react system of AI to get a job done. All that deep learning is one building blocks of autonomous systems.
Another import aspect of self-driving cars is that the computers needed to keep them on the road not only have to learn and react but also actually see what's going on. Most automakers use Lidar to scan the surrounding world with lasers to create a vast pixel map. The amount of data created by all those pinpoints is staggering. Mercedes thinks it's solved the problem of trying to crunch all that information by joining blocks of pixels to create single objects. So instead of an automobile trying to decipher 500,000 pixels, the car only has to figure out the location of 1,000 object-specific rectangles called "Stixels." Each Stixel can be a person, car, or object and is assigned a color based on how close they are to the vehicle.
Experiments like this are part of the company's new CASE (Connected, Autonomous Driving, Shared usage and Electric drive) strategy. Mercedes wants to build its own future instead of teaming up with a tech company. When you're beholden to another entity, you're stuck with whatever they decide to add to their platform. So it's got its Silicon Valley facility working hard on a variety of initiatives.
During a recent tour of the R&D headquarters, I saw the shiniest result of those initiatives and latest CASE project, the EQ concept vehicle it unveiled at the Paris Auto show. The electric car has autonomous features, replaced the dash with a giant display and shed all of its mirrors in favor of tiny cameras. While the vehicle looks like it's a prop from a reboot of TRON, it's actually the launching pad of the EQ line of vehicles and home energy storage.
Sadly the concept vehicle on display will never appear in showrooms. Instead it's a marketing tool for the launch of the upcoming EQ brand of vehicles and mobility initiatives that will start appearing in three years. It's a new category within the company similar to Smart, it's small-car subsidiary. But while the new business venture is a ways off, the automaker is already adding connected features to its current and upcoming lineup of Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
The automaker already has an iOS and Apple Watch companion app for locking the doors. In the next year it'll be adding Google home support. Drivers will be able to interact with the search-giant's home assistant with the sound of their voice while driving. The integration will also learn a person's habits and will offer to turn on or off devices based on the car's location via AI. Don't worry if you're already part of the Alexa or HomeKit ecosystem, both of those platforms are being investigated.
But it's not just the cars Mercedes sells to individuals that are being upgraded. The automaker is working on speeding up deliveries from services like UPS, FedEX and DHL. In a garage a few miles from the main building, a team of researchers is building a carpet-like covering for the shelves and floor of a delivery van that can weigh a package no matter where it is.
I was initially unsure why the weight of each box was important. That was until they explained that the system can pinpoint the location of any item in the truck based on its mass and can have nearby LEDs light up when the driver needs to find said package.
According to Mercedes, tests of the system with local delivery drivers have increased efficiency 35 percent. The drivers no longer have to hunt for a box that slid around the back of the truck during a sharp turn, the system just knows where everything is.
It's research like this that could help the automaker maintain the pace needed to compete in the increasingly accelerating automotive tech landscape. It's a legacy brand that's seen the cars changing quicker in the past few years than in the previous 90. It's done a good job keeping up, but pressure from Tesla, Google and established automakers means it has to be more nimble and think outside horsepower and tires. Even if it means experiments with mechanical typewriters and fairy tales.
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi's governor has signed the nation's tightest abortion restrictions into law.
Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1510 on Monday afternoon. It becomes law immediately and bans most abortions after 15 weeks' gestation. Bryant has frequently said they want Mississippi to be the "safest place in America for an unborn child."
The law's only exceptions are if a fetus has health problems making it "incompatible with life" outside of the womb at full term, or if a pregnant woman's life or a "major bodily function" is threatened by pregnancy. Pregnancies resulting from rape and incest aren't exempted.
Abortion rights advocates are calling the law unconstitutional because it limits abortion before fetuses can live outside the womb. The owner of Mississippi's only abortion clinic opposes the law and has pledged to sue.
FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — European businesses are unsettled as they watch the U.S. and China collide over trade. And for good reason: the nascent global trade war presents the biggest threat to the economic upswing that has helped the region get past its financial crisis.
In theory, some European companies could benefit, jumping into market niches if Chinese businesses are kept out of the U.S. market. But that would only be a few companies or sectors.
When your entire economy is heavily dependent on trade, an overall slowdown in global commerce caused by tit-for-tat import taxes provokes fear and undermines confidence.
And that's just what's happening in Europe. By one measure, business confidence has fallen in six of the past seven months in Germany, where exports are almost half of annual economic output.
"It's worth all our efforts to defuse this conflict, so it doesn't become a war," said German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday.
The U.S. is due to put tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on Friday. The Chinese will respond with tariffs on an equivalent value of U.S. products such as soybeans, seafood and crude oil.
Amid all this, Europe has its own trade dispute with the U.S. After the U.S. put tariffs on steel and aluminum from many allies, including the European Union, the 28-country bloc responded with import taxes on some $3.25 billion of U.S. goods. The Trump administration is also studying the option of putting tariffs on cars, which would significantly escalate the confrontation.
The head of the European Union's executive commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, will head to Washington in late July to try to personally persuade Trump against further measures targeting Europe.
The disputes over trade threaten to spoil the good times for Europe's economy.
Growth last year was the strongest in a decade, since before the global financial crisis. While that has eased in recent quarters the economy has still done well enough to reduce create jobs. The number of unemployed people fell by 125,000 in May, leaving unemployment in the 19 countries that use the euro at 8.4 percent, the lowest since 2008. Joblessness is still high in some places, like Greece and Spain, but the overall rate is down from a high of 12.1 percent in 2013.
"Trade tensions stoked by U.S. President Donald Trump are clouding the economic outlook in Europe," wrote analysts at Berenberg bank in London. They rated the risk ahead of troubles from Italy's heavy debt load or tighter credit conditions by central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Many European companies would suffer because they both produce and sell goods in the U.S. and China, the world's biggest economies.
For example, tariffs that China is expected to impose Friday on U.S.-made autos would hit German carmakers Daimler and BMW since they both make vehicles in the United States and export them to China.
Daimler has already lowered its outlook for profits, citing higher than expected costs from the new tariffs. BMW warned in a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Friday that tariffs would make it harder for BMW to sell vehicles built at its U.S. factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina in China, "potentially leading to a strongly reduced export volumes and negative effects on investment and employment in the United States."
Last year, BMW exported 272,000 vehicles from the Spartanburg plant, more than half its total production. Of those, 81,000 — worth $2.37 billion — went to China. BMW says its exports reduced the U.S. trade deficit by around $1 billion.
By themselves, the tariffs that take effect Friday won't immediately have a dramatic impact on global trade. The fear is that retaliation will spiral, hitting the total amount of global commerce.
Even if the overall effect is to harm growth, there could be benefits for some European companies and sectors. Economists Alicia Garcia Herrero and Jianwei Xu at the French bank Natixis say that European makers of cars, aircraft, chemicals, computer chips and factory machinery could in theory snare market gains by substituting for Chinese or American products in the two markets. But that's only if Europe's own trade dispute with the U.S. does not escalate — a big if.
Europe is waiting to see whether the Trump administration will go ahead separately with tariffs on auto imports. European companies like BMW, Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen's Porsche and Audi divisions, and Fiat Chrysler send $46.6 billion worth of vehicles every year to the U.S. Some 13.3 million people, or 6.1 percent of the employed population of the EU, work in the automotive sector, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
"Europe cannot win anything" on an overall basis "for one obvious reason: we are net exporters," said Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis and a senior fellow at European research institute Bruegel. "But we should not understate the view that some sectors could get something out of a U.S.-China trade war."
Amid the brewing conflict, China has sought to get Europe on its side, put on a diplomatic charm offensive during visits by Merkel and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. The EU and China agreed last month to deepen commercial ties and support trade rules. But the EU remains a close, longtime ally of the U.S. on a range of issues, despite the current tensions with the Trump administration.
One negative outcome for Europe, Herrero said, would be if Trump can push the Chinese into a trade agreement aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The additional U.S. goods to China could come at the expense of European competitors.
"If China concedes to the U.S. proposed agreement, the whole situation faced by the EU would be much tougher," they and Xu wrote in a research note. "For China to massively reduce its trade surplus with the U.S., it has to in some ways substitute its imports away from the EU to the U.S., which would have a significant negative impact on the EU producers."

Exhibition Charts 500 Years of Evolution of Robots
Inspired by their belief that human beings are essentially terrified of robots, Ben Russell set about charting the evolution of automatons for an exhibition they hope will force people to think about how androids and other robotic forms can enhance their lives.
Robots, says Russell, have been with us for centuries -- as "Robots," their exhibit opening Wednesday at London's Science Museum, shows.
From a 15th century Spanish clockwork monk who kisses their rosary and beats their breast in contrition, to a Japanese "childoid" newsreader, created in 2014 with lifelike facial expressions, the exhibition tracks the development of robotics and humankind's obsession with replicating itself.
Arnold Schwarzenegger's unstoppable Terminator cyborg is there, as is Robby the Robot, star of the 1956 film "Forbidden Planet," representing the horror and the fantasy of robots with minds of their own.
There are also examples of factory production-line machines blamed for taking people's jobs in recent decades; a "telenoid communications android" for hugging during long-distance phone calls to ease loneliness; and Kaspar, a "minimally expressive social robot" built like a small boy and designed to help ease social interactions for children with autism.
"When you take a long view, as we have done with 500 years of robots, robots haven't been these terrifying things, they've been magical, fascinating, useful, and they generally tend to do what we want them to do," said Russell, who works at the science museum and was the lead curator of the exhibition.
And while it's human nature to be worried in the face of change, Russell said, the exhibit should help people "think about what we are as humans" and realize that if robots are "going to come along, you've got a stake in how they develop."
A total of 100 robots are set in five different historic periods in a show that explores how religion, industrialization, pop culture and visions of the future have shaped society.
For Rich Walker, managing director of Shadow Robot Company in London, robotics is about what these increasingly sophisticated machines can do for humans to make life easier, particularly for the elderly or the impaired.
"I'm naturally lazy and got involved so that I could get robots to do things for me," Walker said. Their company has developed a robotic hand that can replicate 24 of the 27 natural movements of the human hand.
As humans have a 1 percent failure rate at repetitive tasks, committing errors about once every two hours, the hand could replace humans on production lines, they said.
Walker concedes further erosion of certain types of jobs if inventions such as theirs are successful, but says having repetitive tasks performed by automatons would free up people to adopt value-added roles.
"The issue is to rebuild the economy so that it has a holistic approach to employment," they said.
This in turn leads to questions, raised at the exhibition as well as by the European Union, of whether or not robots should pay taxes on the value of their output as part of the new industrial revolution.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – As snow was falling on the Lala Mountain (拉拉山) in Taoyuan City Saturday afternoon, the authorities announced that roads up the mountain would be closed from 7 p.m.
Taiwan was falling under the grip of a rare wave of cold air this weekend, with snowfall reported from several of the island's tallest peaks Saturday. The mention of snow in the media triggered an exodus from the cities with motorists trying to reach mountainous areas to get a glimpse of the unusual scenery.
The snow in Taoyuan was concentrated in the “Holy Tree area” (神木區) of Fuxing District near the 2,030-meter-tall Lala Mountain, according to local park authorities. During the afternoon, only cars equipped with snow chains would be allowed to reach the local parking lot, the Central News Agency reported.
Due to the snowfall and the expected further plunge in temperatures overnight, the stretch of the Northern Cross-Country Highway, also known as the No.7 road, between Xiabaling (下巴陵) and Xicun (西村) would be preventively shut off from 7 p.m. Saturday until 7 a.m. Sunday, according to CNA.
Areas where the road surface was frozen might also impose overnight traffic bans, while during the day, only vehicles with snow chains on their tires might be allowed to travel there, the authorities said, advising motorists not to drive up the mountains during the night.
Grieving relatives on Tuesday buried two Guatemalan boys whose bodies were found stuffed in sacks over the weekend, a crime that shocked the violence-weary Central American country.
Ten-year-old Carlos Daniel Xiquin and 11-year-old Oscar Armando Toc Cotzajay left for school Friday but were apparently kidnapped. Their bodies were found Sunday near Ajuix, a hamlet in the township of San Juan Sacatepequez, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the capital.
The boys' throats had been slashed and their hands and feet bound. There were reports that strangers had offered them a ride, and neighbors reported a ransom demand was made.
The boys' caskets were accompanied to a cemetery by a parade of residents bearing white balloons and a banner reading "Enough Violence, We Want Justice."
"These children were without sin," said Toc Cotzajay's mother, Maria Eurelia Toc.
If David Moyes thought managing Manchester United was the biggest challenge of their career, they will soon reappraise that evaluation.
This is their greatest test and, should they pass it, it will surely be their finest hour.
The Scot is going to have to be a master coach, inspired motivator and transfer magician .
The Scot is going to have to be a master coach, inspired motivator and transfer magician all rolled into one if they are to keep Sunderland in the Premier League.
Saturday's woeful 4-1 defeat at Burnley left the Black Cats deep in the drop zone.
Injuries continue to plague the side, Lamine Kone was lost midway through the first half and, after that, the defence was lost.
The departure of Victor Anichebe, also with a hamstring injury, not only robbed the team of their powerhouse forward, it drained that vital commodity from the side, confidence.
Not that Big Vic's absence cold in any way be linked to some Sunday League stuff.
Sunderland's soft centre was exposed three times by Andre Gray on 31, 51 and 53 minutes. The opener was a dreadful goal to concede, John O'Shea and Papy Djilobodji challenging each other more effectively than they did Ashley Barnes.
O'Shea only succeeded in helping on Scott Arfield's up-and-under into the path of the unmarked Gray, who strode forward and beat Vito Mannone from 18 yards, the keeper failing to keep out a shot which was pretty much straight at him.
Sunderland could not deal with a hopeful ball forward for the second goal either.
Gray shook off a weak attempt from Djilobodji before rounding an equally lame attempt from Mannone, who had rushed to the edge of the box to tap into the empty net.
Their third goal also had a comedy element. Steven Pienaar stood on they ball as they led an away counter-attack, alowing Burnley to hit their frontmen again, Barnes chesting the ball superbly before playing in Gray, who finished from seven yards.
The Clarets were not finished and when Seb Larsson, ludicrously, pushed over Arfield in the box in the 67th minute, Barnes beat Mannone from the spot.
Fortunately, the scoreline got no worse and Sunderland were able to pull one back in the 71st minute.
Adnan Januzaj took part in a football version of the 110 metres hurdles, skipping over three challenges to find Jermain Defoe, who controlled the ball beautifully before beating Tom Heaton from five yards.
Moyes, whose side now face Liverpool today labelled the display as “dire” and that's being kind.
Now it's over to them and here are three areas the boss must tackle and succeed in.
Transfer magician:
Moyes has already pulled a rabbit out of the hat this season by taking Anichebe off the dole queue and making them the signing of the season.
Money is scarce, so, while the boss may not be expected to get players for free, they do not have millions.
Sunderland were actually in a worse situation 12 months ago, one place and two points below where they are now and eight points from safety.
But this was the month when Sam Allardyce pulled off three brilliant transfers – Wahbi Khazri, Jan Kirchhoff and Kone, the latter two arriving for less than £6million.
All three made a tremendous difference and what work Moyes does in the window could shape the season and their career.One thing is certain, signings are a must for they have no-one in their squad they can promote.
Inspired motivator:
Sunderland is down to the bare bones, squad-wise.
Anichebe and Kone have joined an injury list longer than the A19, and Billy Jones is suspended for today, though at least Didier Ndong and Khazri are available ahead of their trip to the Africa Cup of Nations.
It means the Black Cats will today be facing title contenders Liverpool with a much-depleted side and the Stadium of Light meeting looks anything but a fair contest.
Moyes must raise their troops and have them firing on all cylinders against the Reds and it will be hard 48 hours after a morale-sapping mauling at Burnley.
But should they do that, surely a packed ground will get behind the team.
Moyes must remind Djilobodji how well they had been playing pre-Burnley and they must also get an arm around the shoulder of Mannone, who was culpable for the opening two Clarets goals.
Master coach:
The team effectively picks itself, it's just a case of who goes where. If Jason Denayer passes a fitness test, Moyes could operate them in a back three alongside O'Shea and Djilobodji, with Donald Love and Patrick van Aanholt as wingbacks.
They must make Sunderland hard to beat, just as they were when they took on Liverpool last time at Anfield in November.
The Black Cats must ensure they stay in the game for as long as possible and hope their forward players can take advantage of chances that come their way.
Defoe and Fabio Borini have scored super goals in the last two games, but both have come with the match having already been lost.
The key now is to make sure the goals actually count for something.
Filmmaker Karan Johar walked the ramp for designer label Falguni Shane Peacock on the third day of the ongoing Lakme Fashion Week. Karan Johar dazzled the runway dressed in a stylish jacket in silver and black colour but it was their striking hairdo, which stole the show.
It's that time of the year again when the much awaited Lakme Fashion Week has begun. It was the third day of the LFW 2918 when filmmaker Karan Johar, who is known for their style statements and shining pair of shoes which they loved to show off, walked the ramp for designer label Falguni Shane Peacock on the third day of the ongoing Lakme Fashion Week. Karan Johar dazzled the runway dressed in a stylish jacket in silver and black colour but it was their striking hairdo, which stole the show.
The filmmaker took to micro-blogging site Twitter to share their new look with a spectacular grey hairdo and wrote, “50 Shades of Grey.” Karan has always been vocal about the fact that they love to wear shining ‘OOTD' but we never knew that they would go n experiment this with their hair n still look fabulous. Karan dazzled the ramp with their shimmery attire, grey hair and of course, the confidence that the filmmaker always carries be it any fashion show.
On the work front, Karan's previous directorial venture after Ae Dil Hai Mushkil was a big success and now Dharma Productions has a huge line up of films that they have put their money in – Drive featuring Sushant Singh Rajput and Jacqueline Fernandez, Raazi featuring Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal, Kesari featuring Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra, Brahmastra featuring Ali and Ranbir Kapoor. They will also be seen acting in the upcoming film Welcome to New York. They sure has their plate full. Last year, Karan Johar embraced parenthood and became a single father to twins Roohi and Yash, who were born via surrogacy.
Trump feels vindicated after Republican memo's release
Washington, United States | AFP | US President Donald Trump claimed vindication Saturday in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 White House election, following the release of a controversial memo implying partisanship at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The declassified Republican document released Friday claimed that Democrat-funded research prompted the FBI to spy on a former Trump campaign aide.
“This memo totally vindicates ‘Trump' in probe,” the president tweeted, referring to themselves in the third person.
“But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!”
Democrats and some Republicans say the memo — drafted by Devin Nunes, a Trump transition official, member of congress and House Intelligence Committee chairperson — is a thinly veiled effort to undermine the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia.
The document has glaring holes, detractors say, and the FBI itself said it had “grave concerns” over its accuracy.
Separately, Trump — who is spending the weekend at their Florida resort — crowed on Twitter about their approval ratings.
Rasmussen pollsters “just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain ‘sacred cows.' Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well, someday!”
It was unclear which “sacred cows” Trump was referring to.
Trump's job approval rating is 41.9 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics average of various polls.

Arsenal Transfer News : Arsene Wenger Interested In Sevilla's Steven N'Zonzi
Arsenal have joined the race to sign Sevilla midfielder Steven N'Zonzi, says the Daily Express.
The Frenchman is also reportedly a target for the likes of Chelsea, Man City and Juventus.
The former Stoke and Blackburn man is a tough-tackling presence in central midfield.
Arsenal will lose Mohamed Elneny to the Africa Cup of Nations later this month, and Wenger is keen to bolster their midfield options.
The 28-year-old has emerged as one of the finest midfielders in Europe since joining Sevilla from Stoke in a £7m deal in 2015.
They helped the La Liga outfit win the Europa League in their first season in Spain and was also named in UEFA's Europa League squad of the season.
N'Zonzi, who also played for Blackburn in the top flight, can expect to double their wages by landing a deal worth around £125,000-a-week.

CINCINNATI – Wednesday's US Open Cup match represented the biggest moment for FC Cincinnati since its inception in 2015. And on the biggest stage, the club and the city came through.
An astounding crowd of more than 30,000 fans – a record for a non-final Open Cup match – watched FC Cincinnati produce a clean sheet against Columbus Crew SC to earn a 1-0 win in their fourth-round matchup, the first-ever meeting between the two Ohio clubs.
After the match, FCC head coach Alan Koch didn't mince words about how much the match meant to the team and the city.
“It's Cincinnati against Columbus,” they said. “People can [break] it down and say, ‘It's the first game, so how do you have a rivalry?' Of course we have a rivalry. This is professional soccer, and when you get to play against teams that are this close geographically, it's very important for the clubs … and our fans and both of our cities.”
After the match FC Cincinnati president and general manager Jeff Berding said they were blown away by the city's continued support of the second-year club, especially against their in-state rivals.
“That's a big-league soccer experience right there [against] a big-league club we have a lot of respect for,” they said. “I've said for the last two weeks that we're honored to host [Columbus] here in Cincinnati. They paved the way for our ability to build this club.”
Even in a loss, Crew SC head coach Gregg Berhalter couldn't help but compliment the home team.
They said the match was “what soccer is about,” and praised both the traveling group of more than 1,000 Columbus fans and the Cincinnati fans for the atmosphere.
“This is what makes soccer special,” they said. “It's great to give Americans a taste of a real cup atmosphere – that's exactly what it was. Our fans were amazing, their fans were amazing and it made an atmosphere that was electric.”
Speaking with emotion, Berding said the night epitomized the high aspirations of FCC, who have made their MLS ambitions widely known. But even with those hopes in mind, they said they were stunned by Wednesday's experience.
“In all of our wildest dreams as we started this wonderful club in this wonderful sports fans, we wouldn't have dreamed as big as a night like tonight,” they said. “It's incredibly special. I'm speechless, really. It's a stunning night.”
LANSING, Mich. (AP) — The Latest on the sexual abuse cases and investigations surrounding former sports doctor Larry Nassar (all times local):
11:50 a.m.
Former Michigan Gov. John Engler says they won't be political as interim president of Michigan State University, as it deals with scathing criticism over disgraced sports doctor Larry Nassar.
The Republican told reporters Wednesday, "This is not the time to be political." They say working to change things "starts today."
They spoke after the school's governing board of trustees unanimously voted to hire them following last week's resignation of Lou Anna Simon. Many students and faculty members oppose the decision.
Simon stepped down after Nassar was sentenced to decades in prison for sexual abuse. They were accused of abusing young female athletes for decades under the guise of medical treatment while working for the university and USA Gymnastics.
Engler was governor from 1990 through 2002.
Trustees also named another former governor, Democrat Jim Blanchard, to advise the school as it faces numerous lawsuits and investigations.
___
11:15 a.m.
A Michigan judge says more than 265 people have come forward to say they were sexual assault victims of disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar.
Judge Janice Cunningham gave the figure as another sentencing hearing for Nassar began. Previously, the total number of sexual assault victims was estimated below 200. More women and girls have been coming forward in the wake of Nassar's highly publicized sentencing hearing last week in Lansing.
The hearing that started Wednesday centers on sexual assaults at Twistars. The Lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert. In this case, Nassar has admitted to sexually abusing three girls under the guise of treatment.
Roughly 60 women and girls plan to confront them or have their statement read in the courtroom in Charlotte (shar-LOT'), a city outside Lansing.
___
10:45 a.m.
A 17-year-old former gymnast says former sports doctor Larry Nassar took advantage of their "innocence and trust" and molested them when they were 9 and 12 years old.
Jessica Thomashow was the first to confront Nassar on Wednesday during their final sentencing hearing on sexual abuse charges. About 60 girls and women are expected to testify during the hearing, similar to a hearing in nearby Lansing that ended last week after more than 150 victims came forward.
Thomashow told Nassar what they did to them was "twisted." They say they ask themselves all of the time, "Why?"
Another woman, Annie Labrie, testified that Nassar did things to them that "made my skin crawl" but says adults assured them they were the only option as a doctor.
They say gymnastics, dance and other activities have a "specific culture" that allows such abuse to thrive, and that girls learn at a young age not to question authority.
Wednesday's hearing centers on Nassar assaults at a gymnastics club that was run by 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert.

10:10 a.m.
The final sentencing hearing is underway in a Michigan courtroom for disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar, who has been accused by scores of girls and women of sexual abuse.
The hearing that started Wednesday centers on their assaults at Twistars, a Lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert. In this case, Nassar has admitted to sexually abusing three girls under the guise of treatment.
Roughly 60 women and girls plan to confront them or have their statement read in the courtroom in Charlotte (shar-LOT'), a city outside Lansing.
More than 150 women confronted Nassar during a similar hearing that ended last week with them being sentenced to as much as 175 years in prison. He'd already been sentenced to 60 years in prison for child pornography.
Nassar is accused of abusing young athletes while working for Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics.

9:40 a.m.
Michigan State University trustees have named a hard-nosed former governor and alumnus as interim president as the school faces scathing criticism over its former sports doctor, Larry Nassar.
The school's board of trustees unanimously voted Wednesday to hire John Engler following last week's resignation of Lou Anna Simon.
Simon stepped down after Nassar was sentenced to decades in prison for sexual abuse. They were accused of abusing young female athletes for decades under the guise of medical treatment while working for the university and USA Gymnastics.
Engler was Michigan governor from 1990 through 2002. After leaving office because of term limits, the 69-year-old Republican directed business groups in Washington.
Trustees also named another former governor, Democrat Jim Blanchard, to advise the school as it faces lawsuits filed by more than 100 girls and women and investigations by the state attorney general, the NCAA and Congress.
___
11:30 p.m.
Sports doctor Larry Nassar's return to court to face another prison sentence for molesting gymnasts could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another Michigan county.
Judge Janice Cunningham has set aside several days for roughly 60 people who want to confront Nassar or have their statement read in court. This time Nassar is to be confronted by gymnasts from an elite Michigan club run by an Olympic coach.
Last week Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison.
The hearing starting Wednesday in Eaton County centers on their assaults at Twistars, a Lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 Olympic coach John Geddert. Nassar admits penetrating three girls with their hands when they were supposed to be treating them for injuries.
A mill nearly as old as Canada must be sold if it is to survive, its owner says, since the spring flood has just washed through it, and through their hopes of creating a bed and breakfast.
The mill on Brennan's Creek in Old Killaloe has been there since 1870. Owner Anette Clough says it's part country home, part storehouse of history.
"It has a pile of stuff in there: Manual wooden planes, sickles, big wagon wheels, things that fit around a horse's neck." There is equipment for sending flour down a chute into bags, and flour sifters, all pushed to one side of the building.
The other side is renovated: a three-bedroom home on the top two levels, and a smaller apartment with a separate entrance.
They and their soon-to-be ex-husband bought it about four years ago. The couple eventually split; they moved out two years ago and their husband left last fall. The mill has been unoccupied since then.
"I would love, love, love to keep the place. It's an incredible building. I would really love to turn it into a bed and breakfast," they said Monday.
Previous owners blasted out bedrock and put in a 50-kilowatt turbine that generates electricity for sale to the provincial grid. At least it did until a flood three years ago. Clough figures the turbine itself is still fine, but the turbine room may need electrical repairs.
"We almost had it ready to turn on, we had all the electricals checked and cleaned, and then we got flooded three years ago. And that is because we didn't have enough stop logs pulled out of the dam," they said.
With the couple splitting up, they can't afford to invest more money in repairs that are needed in one foundation wall, or in putting the turbine system back into shape.
It's a lovely setting, with a pond behind the dam, walking trails and a foot bridge to the far side of the creek.
"I haven't put it on the market yet because I haven't been wanting to sell it because I really love it. But looking at what happened this year..."
Last week, the rising runoff water spilled past the dam and through the first floor of the mill, in one door and out another.
Clough said a structural engineer looked at the mill since then, recommending repairs to one foundation wall and an overall review of the building when water levels drop.
Stop logs work like plugs in a drain, meaning they can be dropped into position in a dam or lifted out to control how much water can flow through. They are intended to be lifted out in fall, so that the spring flood has an opening where it can rush right through. But the logs are heavy, and Clough and their husband couldn't remove them all last fall, so the dam was partially blocked. Then spring came.
The result is familiar to anyone who has tried to flush a blocked toilet: Water backs up and overflows. It's now receding.
The Killaloe Post, an online magazine that's largely the work of local photographer Lynn Flokstra, recently traced the history of the mill that was built by an Irish immigrant in 1849, and rebuilt after a major fire in 1870.
"At its peak the mill was powered by one wood- and one water-powered engine and was in operation 24 hours a day grinding the wheat harvest for local farmers," the Post notes. "When flour was no longer profitable they ground grain for livestock feed. With the rise of national commercial mills local grain milling became a thing of the past."
The mill had a second life sawing and planing lumber from the 1940s until 1968.
If no one maintains the building, Clough says, "it could get worse, and then the town and the area lose something that has been there forever and is really amazing."

As Mr. Eck says, these systems are at least approaching the point — still many, many years away — when a machine can instantly build a new Beatles song or perhaps trillions of new Beatles songs, each sounding a lot like the music the Beatles themselves recorded, but also a little different. But that end game — as much a way of undermining art as creating it — is not what they are after. There are so many other paths to explore beyond mere mimicry. The ultimate idea is not to replace artists but to give them tools that allow them to create in entirely new ways.
In the 1990s, at that juke joint in New Mexico, Mr. Eck combined Johnny Rotten and Johnny Cash. Now, they are building software that does much the same thing. Using neural networks, they and their team are crossbreeding sounds from very different instruments — say, a bassoon and a clavichord — creating instruments capable of producing sounds no one has ever heard.
Photo
Much as a neural network can learn to identify a cat by analyzing hundreds of cat photos, it can learn the musical characteristics of a bassoon by analyzing hundreds of notes. It creates a mathematical representation, or vector, that identifies a bassoon. So, Mr. Eck and their team have fed notes from hundreds of instruments into a neural network, building a vector for each one. Now, simply by moving a button across a screen, they can combine these vectors to create new instruments. One may be 47 percent bassoon and 53 percent clavichord. Another might switch the percentages. And so on.
For centuries, orchestral conductors have layered sounds from various instruments atop one other. But this is different. Rather than layering sounds, Mr. Eck and their team are combining them to form something that didn't exist before, creating new ways that artists can work. “We're making the next film camera,” Mr. Eck said. “We're making the next electric guitar.”
Called NSynth, this particular project is only just getting off the ground. But across the worlds of both art and technology, many are already developing an appetite for building new art through neural networks and other A.I. techniques. “This work has exploded over the last few years,” said Adam Ferris, a photographer and artist in Los Angeles. “This is a totally new aesthetic.”
In 2015, a separate team of researchers inside Google created DeepDream, a tool that uses neural networks to generate haunting, hallucinogenic imagescapes from existing photography, and this has spawned new art inside Google and out. If the tool analyzes a photo of a dog and finds a bit of fur that looks vaguely like an eyeball, it will enhance that bit of fur and then repeat the process. The result is a dog covered in swirling eyeballs.

At the same time, a number of artists — like the well-known multimedia performance artist Trevor Paglen or the lesser-known Adam Ferris — are exploring neural networks in other ways. In January, Mr. Paglen gave a performance in an old maritime warehouse in San Francisco that explored the ethics of computer vision through neural networks that can track the way we look and move. While members of the avant-garde Kronos Quartet played onstage, for example, neural networks analyzed their expressions in real time, guessing at their emotions.
The tools are new, but the attitude is not. Allison Parrish, a New York University professor who builds software that generates poetry, points out that artists have been using computers to generate art since the 1950s. “Much like as Jackson Pollock figured out a new way to paint by just opening the paint can and splashing it on the canvas beneath him,” they said, “these new computational techniques create a broader palette for artists.”

A year ago, David Ha was a trader with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. During their lunch breaks they started toying with neural networks and posting the results to a blog under a pseudonym. Among other things, they built a neural network that learned to write its own Kanji, the logographic Chinese characters that are not so much written as drawn.
Soon, Mr. Eck and other Googlers spotted the blog, and now Mr. Ha is a researcher with Google Magenta. Through a project called SketchRNN, they are building neural networks that can draw. By analyzing thousands of digital sketches made by ordinary people, these neural networks can learn to make images of things like pigs, trucks, boats or yoga poses. They don't copy what people have drawn. They learn to draw on their own, to mathematically identify what a pig drawing looks like.
Then, you ask them to, say, draw a pig with a cat's head, or to visually subtract a foot from a horse or sketch a truck that looks like a dog or build a boat from a few random squiggly lines. Next to NSynth or DeepDream, these may seem less like tools that artists will use to build new works. But if you play with them, you realize that they are themselves art, living works built by Mr. Ha. A.I. isn't just creating new kinds of art; it's creating new kinds of artists.

Valve continued that the developer and publisher is, in fact, a person calling themselves Ata Berdiyev, who operated as "Elusive Team" and "[bc]Interactive." While those names might not sound familiar, one of the latter's games should: Piccled Ricc. That title was removed from Steam last fall for other legal reasons; it was an extremely thinly veiled copyright violation based on Rick and Morty. The developer was also responsible for Fidget Spinner Simulator 2.
All that to say, Active Shooter's alleged developer has a history of making crass tie-ins that attempt to capture the zeitgeist, regardless of subject matter. This time, critics say they crossed the line of good taste, going beyond cheap shovelware and trying to capitalize on tragedy.
Active Shooter was originally scheduled for a June 6th release, but Valve has promised that's not going to happen.
"[Developer] Ata is a troll, with a history of customer abuse, publishing copyrighted material and user review manipulation," Valve told the BBC. Valve said it discovered who the developer was while "investigating the controversy surrounding" Shooter.
"We are not going to do business with people who act like this towards our customers or Valve," the game-seller said. Now Valve finds itself in a position of explaining how this game is different from the likes of Hatred and others that glorify dark, headline-grabbing violence yet remain for sale on Steam.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (CBSNewYork/AP) — In any other year, a game between the Chargers and Giants would be a time to recall the 2004 draft-day trade when New York acquired No. 1 overall draft pick Eli Manning from San Diego in exchange for No. 4 pick Philip Rivers and a number of a draft picks, including a first-rounder the following year.
It would be a time to note that Manning led the Giants to two Super Bowl titles, and that the Chargers got a highly productive quarterback who has never led them to a title.
That's not the story this year, nor is the Chargers now playing in Los Angeles.
It's a matchup of two desperate 0-4 teams meeting at MetLife Stadium on Sunday.
The Chargers, who have not made the playoffs since 2013, have lost nine straight games dating to late November. The Giants, who got to the playoffs last year for the first time since Manning led them to a second Lombardi Trophy in February 2012, have lost five straight, dating to the wild-card loss to the Packers.
Neither has much of a shot at getting to the playoffs this year. Since the NFL merger in 1970, only the 1992 Chargers have overcome losing the first four games to make the playoffs.

Neither team is thinking that far down the road with 12 games left in the regular season.
“I know the odds and the percentages and all that against an 0-4 team making a run and playing in January are super, super slim, but we're not worried about that,” Rivers said. “We're just trying to win a game right now and then hopefully we can get on a roll. I mean, we've lost so many in a row in a close fashion, so why not find a way to win a bunch in a row that way? But we've got to win one first. And I think this team just needs to win a game. It's been a long time since we felt winning a game.”
The Chargers and Giants may not be as bad as their records indicate. New York has lost its last two games on last-second field goals, and it played the Lions close for three quarters. Los Angeles has losses to the Broncos, Dolphins and Eagles by a combined seven points.
Manning isn't worrying about what has happened this season. The two-time Super Bowl MVP is just trying to work hard, hoping everyone follows their example.

“You can still have fun,” said the 36-year-old Manning, now in their 14th season. “Still have fun doing your job and it's still about enjoying the process of getting better, of figuring out how we're going to work. And getting them excited about the plays that are coming up, excited about the opportunities of where they might get the ball or how we're going to score and how we're going to win this game. It's just trying to do your job and make sure everybody sees how you're handling the circumstance.”
Here are some things to watch in Sunday's game:
GIANTS' O-LINE: It seems like the unit has been the focal point all season. This week is no different. Center Weston Richburg is in the concussion protocol and Brett Jones may start. D.J. Fluker started at right guard last week and could stay there. John Jerry has struggled all season whether playing right or left guard.
With right tackle Bobby Hart seemingly ready to return from an ankle injury, will Justin Pugh, who has played well replacing him, stay there or moves back to left guard. There is also the option to play Hart at left guard.
BOOKEND RUSH: The Chargers have two outstanding defensive ends in Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa. Ingram is tied for second in the league with 5½ sacks. Bosa has two. Los Angeles also can increase the pressure on passing plays by adding Chris McCain and defensive tackle Corey Liuget to the rush. Pugh also noted that the linemen move around, which can be confusing for opposing linemen. New York did not give up a sack in its loss to the Buccaneers last weekend.
RUNNING GAME: Rookie Wayne Gallman finally gave the Giants' a semblance of a running game. They had 11 carries for 42 yards and caught two passes for 8 yards, including a touchdown. Whether they replace Paul Perkins (ribs) as the starter remains to be seen.
RIVERS/MANNING: Despite the losses, both veterans are playing well. Rivers has hit 63.3 percent of their passes for 1,107 yards and seven touchdowns. The negative is four interceptions. Manning and the Giants' offense started slowly this season, but they have five touchdown passes in the last five quarters. They also ran for a rare TD against the Bucs.
BECKHAM'S TELL?: Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. says that Tampa Bay cornerback Vernon Hargreaves told them after the game that the Bucs knew what routes they were going to run. It's hard to say whether Beckham had a tell or the Bucs' pre-game film study was that good. Still, Beckham had seven catches for 90 yards, so you have to wonder. “It still just comes to the point where you have to trust it,” Beckham said. “We have to trust 10 (Manning) to make the throw like they did.”

Alaba market leadership crisis deepens
By Tony Udemba
The lingering crisis over the leadership of Alaba International Amalgamated Traders Association in Ojo Local Government Area of Lagos State, recently took a swing as the founding President and Chairman, Board of Trustees, Fancy and Furniture Dealers Association (FFDA), Chief Alex Emechebe, has lampooned those clamouring for the removal of Emeka Mozoba as the President of the association, saying that Mozoba, the current Chairman of FFDA, remains the authentic Chairman of Alaba International Amalgamated Traders Association.
They insisted that Mozoba, like other past leaders, must be allowed to serve out their full tenure and would not be intimidated or stampeded out by any group of persons under whatever nomenclature. They added that, “the call for their removal from office was mischievous and unacceptable to the members of FFDA.”
Emechebe described those behind the call for Mozoba to step down, as those who had no true knowledge about the history of the formation of Alaba International Amalgamated Traders Association, even as they posited that, “no one can remove Mozoba as the President because it is the turn of FFDA to head the association.”
Speaking to Daily Sun in their office in Lagos recently, they disclosed how the association was formed in 1990 during the regime of Brig-Gen. Raji Rasaki as the military governor of Lagos State. They said, “during the time of Raji Rasaki as the military governor of Lagos State, there was a time Alaba International Market was closed down due to fracas between some touts operating in the market and the police, which led to the destruction of Ojo police station, together with police vehicles.
“As leaders from various associations in the market then, we followed up the matter with keen interest, and while doing so, we discovered the need for all associations to come together under one umbrella to speak louder with one voice. That was how we formed Alaba International Amalgamated Traders Association.”
Emechebe, who is also a member of Board of Trustees of the association noted that the association as a central union of all the associations in the market was created to protect the interests of traders, make the market environment safe and peaceful in order to attract customers from within and outside the country.

Those around Buhari buried their own loot in Aso Rock – Fayose
Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State has alleged that some people close to President Muhammadu Buhari buried loot in the presidential villa in Abuja.
Fayose made the claim in response to the statement of Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, that looters have resorted to burying stolen funds in their backyards, deep forests and burial grounds.
Mohammed said this while saying whistle-blowing policy of the Federal Government had been yielding results, according to The Cable.
But in a statement issued on their behalf by Lere Olayinka, their spokesperson, Fayose said Mohammed was only trying to play on the intelligence of Nigerians.
“Looters in the Muhammadu Buhari's presidency, especially those being compensated for funding the election of the president in 2015 bury their own loot in the villa with presidential protection,” they said in a statement.
“Should it be wrong for other supposed looters that do not have presidential protection like the Progressives Congress (APC) looters to bury their loots in burial grounds probably for spiritual protection?
“Nigerians can no longer be fooled with stage-managed loots recoveries, with no traceable owners (looters), especially when the loots are traceable to close associates of the president and their cabinet members.
“Obviously, this so-called anti-corruption war has become a laughing stock with N49 million found in Kaduna Airport, N448 million discovered in a shop at Victoria Island, Lagos and N13 billion found in Ikoyi, Lagos neither having owners nor the identities of owners of the property where the money was found known.”
Fayose claimed that it is either the recovered monies belong to those around Buhari or the government planted them “to sustain its fake anti-corruption fight”.
“It is either the money belongs to members of Buhari's government or it is being planted by the government to sustain its fake anti-corruption fight in the minds of the people,” they said.
“Enough of stage-managed and fake anti-corruption war aimed solely at opposition figures, especially presidential hopefuls in the 2019 election.”
The governor alleged that two different laws were now being operated in the country, saying one is for the APC and those who decamp to the party and the other for the opposition, especially those perceived as having presidential ambition.
“The narrative they push daily is that only those in their government are saint while other Nigerians, including those in the national assembly, judiciary, opposition politicians and the civil servants are rogues while only Buhari's appointees are saints,” they said.
“To worsen matters, the cluelessness of the APC government in the last two years has plunged the country into debt without anything to show.
“The cabals in the presidency are also taking advantage of the president's state of health, which is as a result of their age to oppress Nigerians.
“Nigerians must therefore keep their eyes on the ball and not be carried away by the orchestrated distractions aimed at preventing them from seeing how the APC led government has failed woefully.”
They called on the international community to hold Nigeria accountable on the recovered N13 billion cash found in that Ikoyi, Lagos apartment saying; “this must not be swept under the carpet.”

Look Out Health Care 'Tapeworm': Amazon and Friends Are Out To Get You
Amazon, Warren Buffett and JPMorgan are forming a new company to address the health care costs of their employees, sending shares of health care companies down sharply across the entire sector despite the vague nature of the announcement.
On Tuesday Amazon's Jeff Bezos [pictured above] said that he, along with Buffet and JPMorgan, would attempt to make health care better for hundreds of thousands of their employees, and perhaps, eventually, the country.
There were few details and those involved said the project is in the early planning stage.
"The ballooning costs of (health care) act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy," said Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway, in a prepared statement. "Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable."
The new company will be independent and "free from profit-making incentives and constraints." The businesses said the new venture's initial focus would be on technology that provides "simplified, high-quality and transparent" care.
It was not clear if the ultimate goal is to eventually move beyond Amazon, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan. However, JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jaimie Dimon said, "our goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans."
The potential disruption from three renowned innovators in technology and finance sent a shock wave through the health care sector, erasing billions in market capitalization in seconds.
Six of the top ten companies with significant share declines on the Standard & Poor's 500 index were health care companies. Almost all companies in the health field were in retreat Tuesday.
The need for a solution to the health care crises in the U.S. is intense. With about 151 million non-elderly people, employer-sponsored coverage is the largest part of the U.S. health insurance market.
Health care costs for companies routinely rise faster than inflation and eat up bigger portions of their budgets. Americans are mired in a confusing system that creates a mix of prices in the same market for the same procedure or drug and offers no easy path for finding the best deal.
The rising costs of health care have dragged on U.S. companies, big and small, and employees are increasingly feeling that pain. Employers have hiked deductibles and other expenses for employees, meaning less spending power for almost all Americans.
Only 50 percent of companies with three to 49 employees offered coverage last year, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. That's down from 66 percent more than a decade ago. The federal Affordable Care Act requires all companies with 50 or more full-time employees to offer it.
Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan say they can bring their scale and "complementary expertise" to what they describe as a long-term campaign.
Amazon's entry into the health market has been perceived as imminent, even though the company had announced nothing publicly.
It has been watched very closely on Wall Street, which has seen Amazon disrupt numerous industries ranging from book stores to clothing chains.
Amazon, which mostly sold books when it was founded more than 20 years ago, has radically altered the way in which people buy diapers, toys or paper towels. Most recently it has upended the grocery sector, spending $14 billion last year for Whole Foods Market Inc.

An Arizona man who sold ammunition to gunman in the mass shooting at a Las Vegas country music festival is being charged for illegally manufacturing armor-piercing bullets.
Douglas Haig, who had been called a person of interest in the investigation, faces a charge of conspiracy to manufacture and sell armor-piercing ammunition while not being licensed to do so. According to a criminal complaint filed Friday, unfired bullets found in shooter Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints.
READ THE COMPLAINT HERE
Haig said in a press conference Friday that Paddock didn't raise suspicions that they planned to commit any crimes. Later Friday, they appeared in federal court in shackles with their lawyer, Marc Victor. The judge ordered them to surrender their passport, guns, ammunition and tools used to manufacture ammunition.
They appeared this afternoon before U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Michelle H. Burns and was released on a bond with conditions pending a status conference regarding scheduling of a preliminary hearing on Feb. 15 in Phoenix.
If convicted, they face the statutory maximum penalty of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, or both.
Haig met Paddock for the first time at a gun show in Las Vegas on Aug. 27 when Paddock purchased several packages of ammunition. Paddock then met Haig again at a Phoenix gun show on Sept. 9.
According to the criminal complaint, Paddock had tried to buy bulk ammunition at the show, but the transaction could not be completed because the show was closing for the day. Haig and Paddock exchanged numbers and agreed to coordinator Paddock's future purchase of ammunition. The complaint states that Haig spoke to Paddock on Sept. 19 and provided them directions to their Mesa, Arizona, residence, where the sale was later completed.
The ammunition was put in an Amazon box that was later found in Paddock's room at Mandalay Bay hotel-casino after the shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.
While Haig does not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, they had a website where they sold specialized military ammunition, including armor piercing ammo, according to the criminal complaint. The website was later taken down.
In addition, armor-piercing ammunition was found during a search of Haig's Mesa residence.
Business records showed that Haig sold armor piercing ammunition throughout the U.S., including Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Wyoming, and South Carolina.
Miramar has taken its share of criticism -- some players have complained that its open terrain is too sniper-friendly and occasionally barren. However, it still adds some much-needed variety for Xbox One players who've become all too familiar with Erangel (as good as it is) since the early access title reached the console in December. This also gives you a better idea of what to expect going forward. The PC version is clearly going to have the lead in terms of features, but that lead might not extend further than it does today.

If you look closely, parallels can be found between the makeup of the 2018 Iowa football team and the last time the Hawkeye program experienced a magical, unexpected season.
The year was 2015, of course. The year the Hawkeyes were within one yard of the College Football Playoff.
The 2015 Hawkeyes had a promising junior quarterback in C.J. Beathard; 2018 has one, too, in Nate Stanley.
The 2015 Hawkeyes were coming off a 7-5 regular-season record that was dogged by disappointing, narrow losses; the same will be true for 2018.
And perhaps most notably, the 2015 Hawkeyes had a senior class without a bona fide star — but with impressive character — while enjoying a slew of up-and-coming stars like Beathard, Desmond King and Josey Jewell.
That's where the theme of this story is headed.
The 2018 Hawkeye senior class is small (just 11 scholarship players), but can it be mighty? Of the 11 seniors, five are former walk-ons and none is a sure-fire NFL draft pick.
But underneath them, there is obvious rising talent with ample experience — players like Stanley, Noah Fant, Anthony Nelson, Amani Hooker, T.J. Hockenson, A.J. Epenesa and Tristan Wirfs … to name a few. Each of those names I listed? Health permitting, I think you'll see 100 percent of them in the NFL someday.
That was the exact complexion of the 2015 team — one that was led by a diligent, strong senior class. It's something that defensive end Parker Hesse, the most experienced player on the 2018 roster with 34 college starts, has identified.
“That's really a special group of senior leaders, that 2015 team," Hesse said. "Now that I'm in that position as one of the older guys on the team, you try to model the way they kept guys in check, the way they encouraged players. That's kind of the standard, at least in my experience, for leadership."
But how do Hesse and the Hawkeyes go about repeating what worked in a season that ended with a school-record 12 wins and a Rose Bowl?
To try to uncover the secrets of that memorable season's success, I tracked down three of that team's impactful fifth-year seniors — center Austin Blythe, running back Jordan Canzeri and safety Jordan Lomax — and asked them how (and if) the 2015 formula could be repeated in Iowa City in 2018.
Here is what they had to say.
The humbling 'HawkSlayer' Bowl triggered change.
Canzeri, who would become the gritty leader of Iowa's 2015 running game, remembers clearly what they saw and felt after the Jan. 2, 2015 TaxSlayer Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida.
What they saw: A group of seniors, including Outland Trophy winner Brandon Scherff, who ended their Hawkeye careers in stunned disappointment. A 45-28 drubbing by Tennessee — a game that wasn't that close, and one that Iowa assistant Brian Ferentz would later refer to as the “HawkSlayer” Bowl — cemented an unfulfilling season that had unraveled.
What they felt: Regret about not playing better to send off the seniors with a win. And determination that expectations had to be raised.
“We thought that was the bar,” Canzeri said. “But we knew, we had to raise it even higher.”
Accountability became a daily buzz word among the seniors, 13 of whom were named to the 2015 team's leadership group — Blythe, Canzeri, Lomax, Darian Cooper, Adam Cox, Jake Duzey, Jacob Hillyer, Marshall Koehn, Nate Meier, Drew Ott, Travis Perry, Macon Plewa and Tevaun Smith.
What did accountability look like?
“Everybody bought in,” said Blythe, the only Hawkeye chosen in the 2016 NFL draft (five spots before the last pick of the last round). “There wasn't anybody off doing their own thing.”
Everybody. From veterans to rookies.
But it had to start with the seniors.
“The leadership was unlike anything I've ever been a part of,” Lomax said. “It wasn't one person individually. That was the beauty of it.”
It became well-documented that the team book called “The Slight Edge” by author Jeff Olson served as a reference guide to restoring the Hawkeye culture. Seniors gave lesson-specific presentations to younger teammates.
The habits stuck and became contagious.
“Each senior bought into 'The Slight Edge' principles on a daily basis,” Lomax said. “When you see a positive example coming from the leaders of a team, it trickles down into the juniors, sophomores and freshmen. And they all got on the same page as well.”
Then?
“We probably had one of our better spring balls since I've been there,” Lomax said. “And we carried those daily habits into the summer.”
By all accounts, the 2018 Hawkeyes are off to a similar start.
Players like Hesse and fifth-year lineman Keegan Render report a renewed hunger at the Iowa Football Performance Center after back-to-back 8-5 seasons.
They realize, as seniors, they must set the locker-room tone.
They seem confident, so far, that a similar groundwork has been set; the one they learned in 2015 as redshirt freshmen.
“We have a really good group of guys right now,” Hesse said. “One thing that's really special about it is we really enjoy each other's presence — any age on the team, any position group.”
A new team book has been introduced — “Pound the Stone: 7 Lessons to Develop Grit on the Path to Mastery” by Joshua Medcalf. If that title sounds familiar, it should.
Longtime strength and conditioning coach Chris Doyle introduced a “Break the Rock” mantra to a Hawkeye program that required a massive rebuild in 1999. Those principles led to three straight national top-10 finishes from 2002 to 2004.
Break the Rock; The Slight Edge; Pound the Stone.
Lessons of 1999 and 2015 are being applied with the goal of a resounding 2018.
“Just every day, showing up and swinging,” Hesse said. “You never know when that moment's going to come, the big breakthrough, the big moment of success. But it's not that moment that's significant; it was all the swings of the hammer before.”

One thing is certain: Adversity will come.
It's one thing to identify a winning plan — and even see it through until the end of August camp.
But once game-day pressure hits, it's quite another thing to execute the plan.
Even if the 2018 Hawkeyes do everything right this offseason, they need to navigate toward a place of resiliency in the face of Saturday adversity — just like the 2015 team did.
The first true test came Sept. 12, 2015 — week two at Iowa State. Here was an opponent that had barged into Kinnick Stadium a year earlier and (with a second-half comeback and a last-second field goal) stunned Iowa, 20-17.
And now, the Hawkeyes were at halftime inside revved-up Jack Trice Stadium, having lost their best defensive player to injury (Drew Ott) and trailing, 17-10, after a failed fake field goal.
“That second half,” Lomax said, “we had to really pull together and fight.”
Iowa would shut out the Cyclones after halftime. And after a 31-17 win, players locked arms as they retrieved the rivalry trophy from the Iowa State sideline.

“The locker room was excited, ecstatic,” Lomax said. “From there, our belief just kept growing.”
And the lessons kept coming.
Koehn's game-ending 57-yard field goal the following week to beat Pittsburgh, 27-24, demonstrated the importance of playing a full 60 minutes.
Two weeks later, Meier's forced fourth-quarter fumble at the goal line preserved a 10-6 win at Wisconsin — the type of “Break the Rock" triumph the program needed after not having beaten the Badgers since 2009.
Canzeri remembers that victory, which moved the Hawkeyes to 5-0, cementing a belief among players that something special was afoot. But inside the game, they also found personal motivation.
Canzeri was beating themselves up, knowing their late fumble nearly cost the Hawkeyes (thankfully for Iowa, Cole Croston recovered). Hillyer, a senior teammate, offered uplifting words to Canzeri that stuck with him.
And so, as maybe it was meant to be, Canzeri was the one to deliver the finishing hammer a week later vs. Illinois.
A 43-carry, 256-yard rushing performance earned Canzeri national player-of-the-week honors. With Beathard laboring through an earlier injury, Iowa resorted almost exclusively to handoffs — and Canzeri got 11 straight on a clinching drive that consumed nearly seven minutes in a 29-20 win.
“That really epitomizes that season,” Blythe recalled. “Just bearing down and gritting through things. … That's a testament to Jordan, a testament to the rest of the players on the team that kind of willed us through that adversity.”
One of the most important factors in the 2015 team's success, though, was the depth that was built in the offseason. Canzeri remembers their senior group being especially cognizant of making sure young players would be ready to go.
“We were close with the freshmen," Canzeri said.
That execution was no more necessary than the following week at Northwestern.
Beathard could barely walk but played anyway; a decimated offensive line forced a true first-year student, James Daniels, to make their first career start; and third- and fourth-stringers Akrum Wadley and Derrick Mitchell Jr. shouldered the run game in relief of injury-sidelined Canzeri and LeShun Daniels Jr.
Iowa rushed for 294 yards and its patchwork lineup routed the favored Wildcats, 40-10.
Suddenly, the Hawkeyes were 7-0.
And outsiders were believing what the Hawkeye players already did — that this team was for real.
“We lost so many guys that year,” Lomax said. “You could just see guys were bought in, whether you were first string, second string or third string.
“As the wins kept piling up, our confidence kept piling up.”
After a bye week, a determined Iowa roster would not be deterred.
Even with Beathard operating through severe pain that would require offseason sports-hernia surgery, Iowa finished with wins against Maryland, Indiana, Minnesota, Purdue and Nebraska to complete a historic 12-0 regular season.
Iowa, despite lacking a single senior star, was the talk of college football.
(Take note, 2018 Hawkeyes.)
“That's the beauty of football. It's not just a one-man sport,” Lomax said. “As long as your team is committed to putting in those daily habits that will eventually lead you to a win, you can be unstoppable.”

Some supportive advice from Iowa's 2015 seniors.
Those who played on the 2015 team share a similar takeaway.
First, they know it'll be a season forever remembered in Hawkeye history.
"12-0 and inches away from the College Football Playoff,” Blythe said. “I'm getting goosebumps talking about it.”
But the 16-13, last-minute loss to Michigan State in the Big Ten title game, then a 45-16 Rose Bowl drubbing against Stanford brings regret.
“It still nags at me,” Lomax said.
Surveying the 2018 Iowa season ahead, there's another notable similarity with 2015 — a regular-season schedule that offers opportunity.
The Hawkeyes won't play Michigan, Michigan State or Ohio State from the Big Ten East. Three of Iowa's four rivalry games occur at home — Iowa State, Wisconsin and Nebraska.
The schedule is still tricky, though. An Oct. 27 date at Penn State is one of four Hawkeye road games in a span of five middle-of-the-season Saturdays.
So, how about some parting advice from the guys who got it (mostly) done in 2015?
Lomax's message to the 2018 seniors like Hesse, Jake Gervase, Aaron Mends, Matt Nelson and Brandon Snyder: “They were on that team. They have the recipe. They know what to do. It just comes down to them owning up to it; taking that leadership accountability and bringing the guys together.”
From Blythe, who now plays for the Los Angeles Rams: “Make it your team. It's your last go-round. Ultimately, 2018 is going to be remembered for the seniors, just like I think 2015 was remembered for us. I tell people that we wanted to be one of those teams Coach (Kirk) Ferentz referenced for five, 10, 15 years down the road.”
And lastly, from Canzeri: “Don't pressure yourselves. Don't think of anybody outside the facility. Just you and your brother. Don't let your emotions get to you. Always be ready for the next play. Always keep each other up. Keep the energy going. Keep the love going. And it'll slowly fall into place.”

STUTTGART, Germany (AP) — Former United States defender Steven Cherundolo joined Bundesliga club Stuttgart on Tuesday as an assistant coach.
Stuttgart said the 38-year-old Cherundolo, who was last in charge of Bundesliga rival Hannover's under-17 team, joined with Ilija Aracic as a co-trainer for head coach Tayfun Korkut, who was appointed as Hannes Wolf's replacement on Monday.
Stuttgart parted company with Wolf on Sunday following the team's 2-0 loss to Schalke. It was Stuttgart's sixth loss in seven Bundesliga games and it left the club only three points above the relegation zone.
Cherundolo is breaking their association with Hannover, which they joined as a player in 1999 before going on to make 302 Bundesliga and 68 second-division appearances. They were captain from 2010 until they ended their playing career and began coaching in 2014. Cherundolo also made 87 appearances for the United States.
The 47-year-old Aracic is returning to Stuttgart after coaching the club's under-19 team from 2012-15. They were last in charge of fourth-tier club FV Illertissen.
Aracic, a former striker, made 25 league appearances for Hertha Berlin, while they also had spells at second-division teams Chemnitzer FC, Tennis Borussia Berlin and Arminia Bielefeld.
Korkut and their new coaching team have been charged with ensuring Stuttgart does not make an immediate return to the second division after securing promotion as division champion under Wolf last season. The 36-year-old Wolf had been in charge since September 2016.
DECATUR, Ga. (AP) – Another major highway in metro Atlanta has been closed, this one because an underground gas leak caused the fast lane to buckle.
DeKalb County spokesperson Sarah Page says the pavement on Interstate 20 buckled in the HOV lane Monday morning, several miles southeast of downtown Atlanta. All westbound lanes are closed until further notice.
WXIA-TV reports the large bump in the interstate is about 3 feet high.
It's the second time a major highway in the Southeast's largest city has become defective in the past few weeks. A large fire allegedly set by a man smoking crack cocaine caused overpass on Interstate 85 to collapse a few miles north of downtown Atlanta on March 27.

Australian Opposition Leader Believes Bitcoin is Fueling Terrorism
The left opposition leader of Australia, Bill Shorten, has indicated they want to deter use of cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. The leader said this Tuesday in a house of representatives meeting. Shorten suggested that terrorists are starting to leverage dark markets and other nefarious venues to fuel their bad deeds.
Also read: The Hidden Reason Behind Bitcoin's Increasing Fees: Darknet Mixers
They said, “I refer to the use of the digital currency bitcoin and the use of the dark web, a network of untraceable online activities and hidden websites, allowing those who wish to stay in the shadows to remain hidden. Terrorists are increasingly using this network to avoid detection, conduct planning and acquire capability and tools to carry out their evil actions”
Shorten loosely admitted that government does not yet know enough about cryptocurrency or the dark web to handle them. In their statement they referenced them, saying, “There are two things we simply do not know enough about to deal with properly.” This also implies the Australian government could approach the issue in a variety of ways, but that cryptocurrency is a growing concern as a result of possible “terrorism.”
They finished by claiming certain actions are necessary for the safety and security of the Australian citizens. They said:
Just as we continue to do everything in our power to protect Australians, we must do everything in our power to foster cohesion in our society. This is a responsibility we bear as national leaders and also an obligation shared by the leaders of Australia's Muslim community.
Cryptocurrency Inspires Fear and Love
The Australian leader wants everyone in their country to share their fear of dark markets and cryptocurrencies since terrorists could possibly exploit them. However, the current times are strange. Some countries and their government, like Australia, harbor a deep skepticism toward cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. But others seem to take a more positive approach. They may even love digital currencies.
For instance, places like Japan and, more recently, Russia…appear to harbor more positive and loving feelings toward the currencies. Japan has already accepted digital currencies on the whole, and Russia is considering it as vitally important for the future.
On the other side of the coin, some countries like Ecuador, have already banned cryptocurrencies and punish people for using them. It seems that Australia's leadership has similar sentiments like in Ecuador, except not quite as extreme.
It is increasingly interesting to watch varying perspectives crop up within different countries around the world as bitcoin and other crypto-assets become more popular.
Do you think Australia will take measures to ban cryptocurrencies or use other strong regulation against it? Let us know in the comments below.

To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered. As I said on Saturday, we condemn, in the strongest possible terms, this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence. It has no place in America.
And as I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws. We all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God.
We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty, that bring us together as Americans.
Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.

Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America. Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Them death fills us with grief and we send their family our thoughts, our prayers and our love.
We also mourn the two Virginia state troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth and their country. Troopers Jay Cullen and Berke Bates exemplify the very best of America and our hearts go out to their families, their friends and every member of American law enforcement.
These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation. In times such as these, America has always shown its true character. Responding to hate with love, division with unity and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.

As a candidate I promised to restore law and order to our country and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear.
We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all Americans, and we will work together so that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams, in their hearts, and to express the love and joy in their souls.
Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.
Jack Nicklaus was good enough to win the U.S. Open as an amateur, and they nearly did.
Nicklaus was a 20-year-old U.S. Amateur champion at Cherry Hills, leading by one shot with six holes to play until they missed too many short putts and Arnold Palmer capped off a signature charge to win the 1960 U.S. Open.
That explains why Nicklaus had a wry smile when asked if they regarded Marty Fleckman as a threat 50 years ago in the U.S. Open.
Fleckman was a 23-year-old amateur, an NCAA champion at Houston and winner of the Texas State Amateur. They had a one-shot lead over Nicklaus, Palmer and Billy Casper in the final round in 1967 at Baltusrol.
"Let me put it this way," Nicklaus said. "He was leading after 54 holes. They had a very good chance to win the Open."
But they didn't.
Amateurs just don't win the U.S. Open anymore, bad news for the 14 amateurs at Erin Hills this week. The last amateur winner was Johnny Goodman in 1933, and there's little evidence that will change. Fleckman and Jim Simons in 1971 were the last ones to have a 54-hole lead.
Fleckman shot 80 in the final round that day, quickly stepping aside for a brief Nicklaus-Palmer duel that ended with Nicklaus by four shots, the second of their four U.S. Open titles. Fleckman drove up to Rhode Island the following week and won the prestigious Northeast Amateur at Wannamoisett.
The U.S. Open, for 83 years and counting, belongs to the pros.
"It was a wonderful experience," said Fleckman, the director of golf instruction at Blackhorse Teaching Center in Texas. "I got off to a shaky start. I knew I couldn't win any money, so I tried to attack the golf course. You don't really attack a U.S. Open venue, and I paid the piper."
Simons was a threat to the end at Merion. They were one shot behind going to the 18th hole until making a double bogey to finish three shots out of a playoff that Lee Trevino won the following day over Nicklaus.
Goodman had such a big lead that they shot 76 and still won the U.S. Open. They later won the U.S. Amateur.
Bobby Jones in 1930 at Hoylake is the last amateur to win the British Open. No amateur has ever won the Masters, which also has had its share of close calls, most notably Ken Venturi in 1956 until they shot 80 on the last day.
The amateurs at Erin Hills are facing Dustin Johnson and Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth and Jason Day. The gap between the pros and the amateurs is growing by the year, especially as the competition at the professional level is stronger than ever.
"If it's going to be done, it would be at the U.S. Open, where you can get on the good side of the draw and par is a good score and you're not giving anything to the field," Spieth said. "I imagine it will be done."
Not by him. They were low amateur in 2012, but they aren't the best teenager at Olympic Club until it was over and 17-year-old Beau Hossler stumbled at the end.
Jordan Niebrugge, who was to hit the opening tee shot at Erin Hills on Thursday, was the low amateur at St. Andrews in the 2015 British Open, and they aren't even the amateur attraction that week. Paul Dunne of Ireland shared the 54-hole lead with Day and Louis Oosthuizen, but fell back quickly and shot 78.
Dunne also is at Erin Hills. Much like Fleckman in 1967, the Irishman looks back on that final round as a great experience sprinkled with regrets.
"Major golf courses seem to be set up as different tests from any other week," Dunne said. "Because of that, it can take a few people by surprise. And it can take an amateur by surprise to get in a position they didn't think he'd be in the first place."
Dunne, Spieth and Nicklaus would not rule out an amateur winning a major. So why hasn't it happened?
The simple answer is because they turn pro.
Jon Rahm was low amateur at Oakmont last year in the U.S. Open. After a year of playing PGA Tour competition, they are No. 10 in the world and a threat to win this week. Spieth turned pro during their sophomore year at Texas. Their game matured against the best.
Dunne also considered sheer numbers.
"The amateur game is strong," Dunne said. "The top end amateurs, everyone is quite professional in hos they go about their business. It's hard to see it happening because there are so few amateurs. If you took the top 75 ranked players, and let in the next 75 top amateurs, you'd definitely have an amateur winner in a few years."
Nicklaus still believes if a player is good enough, they can win anywhere, like they almost did in 1960. A year later, still an amateur, Nicklaus tied for seventh in the Masters and tied for fourth in the U.S. Open. And the year after that, they beat Palmer in a playoff at Oakmont for the first of their 18 majors.
"Most of them don't stay amateur very long," Nicklaus said of today's crop. "If I had stayed amateur, do I think I would have won it? Yeah. You have amateurs who are good players, but they usually turn pro before they get real good."
FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — The Latest on sexual assault allegations against Kentucky GOP state Rep. Dan Johnson (all times local):
4:15 p.m.
The Republican leadership of the Kentucky House of Representatives says a GOP lawmaker should resign after a woman accused them of sexually assaulting them in 2013.
A news release from the four GOP House leaders on Monday called a report released earlier in the day by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting "compelling and deeply troubling." The report quotes Maranda Richmond as saying that Dan Johnson assaulted them in the basement of their house in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, 2013.
Johnson did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment Monday.
The leaders of the state Republican and Democratic parties have also called for Johnson to resign. Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said they have not seen the report and wanted to wait "until we get some facts" before commenting.
The Associated Press does not generally identify alleged sexual assault victims, but is doing so because Richmond has gone public.

2:10 p.m.
A Kentucky lawmaker who attracted national attention last year when they compared President Barack Obama and their wife to monkeys has been accused of sexual assault.
The Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting quotes Maranda Richmond as saying they have asked Louisville police to reopen an investigation of Dan Johnson.
Johnson was elected to the state legislature in 2016 — after they posted the Facebook remarks about the Obamas. They didn't respond to a voicemail Monday. Richmond says Johnson assaulted them in 2012. They say they reported it to police in 2013, but the case was closed without charges. No one at the police department responded to a telephone call seeking comment.

The Switch sold more in nine months than the Wii U did in its entire lifetime, which is very good news for Nintendo. It means the company's formula of quirky hardware plus treasured IP is working once more, but better yet, there's a whole wave of Switch owners out there who will have skipped the Wii U altogether. And if they didn't, they more than likely picked up a game or two and let the console gather dust in between major launches. This presents Nintendo with a unique opportunity to recycle some of its better Wii U titles for a new, Switch-wielding audience. The fact that Nintendo did this very thing with Mario Kart 8, positioning it as a Switch launch-window title, did not sit well with me. But putting a less cynical hat on, it does mean people get a chance to play games they would've missed out on had Nintendo tried to forget the Wii U ever existed (like everyone else).
Case in point: I'd never even heard of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze until a colleague flagged it, and I had a Wii U. (It's in a cupboard at a friend's house right now, where it will probably live forever.) What particularly interested me about this DK game was that it's a 2D platformer in a very real sense. Franchises like Zelda, Grand Theft Auto and Mario have conditioned us to expect sprawling 3D worlds as the norm, and yet Tropical Freeze plays almost exactly like the original Donkey Kong Country released on the SNES almost 25 years ago. Outside of some great indie games, I couldn't tell you the last 2D platformer I've played from a big developer. Little Big Planet 3 is the closest thing I can think of, and that's a completely different type of game, really.
I would say Tropical Freeze is the ultimate archetype of a 2D platformer, but then Nintendo basically defined what makes a game like this good decades ago, so no surprise there. This starts with a completely random and unimportant storyline. The opening cutscene shows a fleet of ice-covered ships crewed primarily by penguins encroaching on Donkey Kong Island, presumably seeking warmer shores. They spoil DK's birthday party with the family, so they have to be sent packing. I think that's what's happening, anyway, but who cares? You're not here to get wrapped up in believable storyline; you're here to bounce off penguins' heads and beat the game.
Name a platformer trope, Tropical Freeze has it. A little map of the world you navigate to move between levels? Check. A set of collectibles on each stage for the completionists among us, à la Crash Bandicoot? Absolutely. There's also the mid-level power-ups -- in this case, Diddy, Dixie and Cranky Kong, which hop on Donkey's back, give them more health points and augment their jump to make everything a bit easier. The DK version of Yoshi, in other words. What's relatively unique about Tropical Freeze is that on each world, there exists a shop. You collect coins within levels, which can be exchanged for things like extra lives, fall saves or a Kong on your back when you start the level. I find the parrot particularly useful, which squawks when you're near a secret, helping massively with hard-to-find collectibles.
It's very easy to bank up a shedload of coins, though, and since none of these items are anywhere near essential to completing levels, they feel like an element you could completely ignore if you wanted to. Perhaps in time I'll come to value the help more, because I haven't actually played that much of the game yet -- not through lack of trying, but because it's really hard. Don't let the cartoony graphics and cuddly characters fool you: This is a precision platformer. It feels almost like Super Meat Boy meets Super Mario, only the deaths sting that much more. It's worth noting here that I'm playing on the classic setting, not the new Funky Kong mode that's exclusive to the Switch edition launching May 4th. In fact, it's the only major difference between the two versions.
Playing as Funky Kong is the game's equivalent of an easy mode. They have a double jump, air glide, permanent roll attack and way more health points. They also look pretty rad, with a California surfer–style outfit, shades and a board. I couldn't resist playing the game the way it's meant to be played, though, which by comparison is brutal. Accurate jumps and timing are essential to making it through even the early levels. Tropical Freeze isn't particularly unique in its level design, though it does an excellent job of rewarding exploration of your limited 2D plane. After a while, you'll start to see hallmarks of where a secret area might lie, concealed in plain sight. Otherwise, the game is about jumping between platforms, vines, etc., and avoiding enemies or bopping them on the head for extra height.
That sounds easy enough, but Donkey Kong has a weight to him. The character physics are subtle but extremely important. DK has a turn rate, a short acceleration period and a braking distance. In many levels, you'll get into a rhythm and find a line: this platform to that vine to that enemy's head, and so on. If you get off-beat with a poor jump (assuming you didn't fall right away) and you've got too much or too little momentum, it can be hard to recover. It can get frustrating when you can't settle in, but it makes it all the more satisfying when you cruise through part of a level at optimum speed. Throw some light problem-solving into the mix and you've got yourself a charming platformer.
Every time it starts to get a bit samey, the game throws another enemy type or mechanic at you to keep you interested. After completing anything particularly hard, you typically get something easier to cruise through, like a runaway mining cart level. This gives you a sense that progress is always being made. While I'm now invested to the point that I'm going to have to beat the game and find every secret, which is praise in and of itself, there is room for improvement. In my experience, you've no choice but to die occasionally to see what comes next, which is a lazy way to make something challenging. Similarly, you can find yourself in an awesome rhythm and then an enemy spawns out of nowhere that seems intentionally placed to ruin your flow. Mid-level checkpoints are rarely well positioned, either. You often have to repeat a really easy, mundane section collecting bananas and coins before hitting the harder element you're likely to die on a few times.
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is the type of game I rarely play anymore. It's not competitive, requiring countless hours of practice, nor is it some grand story you're immersed in for weeks or months. You grab a controller, blast out a level and then go make dinner. Not having to invest too much time and energy into a game and feeling like you're getting somewhere is refreshing. That said, I imagine you're going to need to be pretty excited about the title to feel comfortable spending $60/£40 on a Wii U rerelease.

China is investigating claims of academic fraud involving mostly Chinese cancer researchers after German publisher Springer withdrew 107 articles from Tumor Biology after finding evidence the 'peer review process was compromised' (AFP Photo/STR)
Beijing (AFP) - China is investigating claims of academic fraud involving mostly Chinese cancer researchers after more than 100 articles were withdrawn from a foreign medical journal.
German publisher Springer announced in April the retraction of 107 articles from Tumor Biology after finding evidence the "peer review process was compromised".
The papers had been produced by Chinese medical institutions and universities and published between 2012 and 2016.
It is standard practise for scholars to submit their research to peers for scrutiny before publishing to ensure the integrity of their work, but fraud is a growing problem.
China's Ministry of Science and Technology said it had "zero tolerance" for such behaviour and pledged to investigate "each and every paper retracted".
Researchers involved in the mass retraction have had their projects and funding suspended, it added.
"The incident has had a very bad influence, seriously tarnishing the international reputation of China's scientific circle and hurting the self-esteem of Chinese scientists," the ministry said Wednesday.
"But it also shows we need to strengthen punishment for academic fraud and to improve the academic atmosphere."
The blog Retraction Watch said it had been told by Springer that "the reviews were submitted under the names of real researchers with faked emails. Some of the authors may have used a third-party editing service, which may have supplied the reviews."
Tumor Biology is now published by SAGE Publications in the United States.
It is not the first time Chinese medical experts have been caught faking peer reviews -- in 2015 London-based BioMed Central pulled 43 articles, which the Global Times said were mostly by Chinese researchers.
In 2016 Springer retracted 64 articles from 10 journals, many written by Chinese contributors, the newspaper added.
The latest incident highlighted the pressure on Chinese doctors in public hospitals to "publish a certain number of papers in national or international journals just to secure promotion or salary rises", Xinhua news agency said.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Social media postings Monday showed at least five women in Iran protesting the obligatory Muslim headscarf by taking theirs off and waving them on sticks.
The videos and photos showed individual women in separate locations in Tehran and Isfahan.
Masoud Sarabi, who witnessed one of the protests, confirmed the authenticity of a video shot on Tehran's Enghelab Street. The others appeared to be authentic, but The Associated Press could not independently verify them.
The women appear to be following the lead of a 31-year-old protester identified as Vida Movahed, who took off their headscarf on the same street in late December. They were detained for a few weeks and then released.
Women showing their hair in public can be jailed for up to two months or fined $25.
The Islamic dress code, in place since the 1979 revolution, considers Islamic veiling or hijab, obligatory for any female above 13 in Iran and says they should cover themselves from head to toe while disavowing any figure-hugging dress.
In late December, police said they would no longer arrest women for failing to observe the code.
The announcement signaled an easing, as called for by the young and reform-minded Iranians who helped re-elect President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, earlier this year.
Many Islamists believe hijab should not be imposed by the law, though they consider it a religious task for every Muslim woman.
Both Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei support softer attitude toward women with improper hijab, though hard-liners opposed to easing such rules still dominate Iran's security forces and judiciary.
The chaos erupted around what is believed to be the largest group of white nationalists to come together in a decade - including neo-Nazis, skinheads, members of the Ku Klux Klan - who descended on the city to "take America back" by rallying against plans to remove a Confederate statue.
NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge in New York hearing two lawsuits challenging the cancellation of a program protecting some young immigrants from deportation has accused President Donald Trump of making "extreme" and "vicious" anti-immigrant statements.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis told Justice Department lawyers Tuesday they could not ignore Trump's "drumbeat" of statements and tweets about immigrants from Mexico and other countries.
Garaufis is hearing lawsuits seeking to overturn the administration's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The plaintiffs say the decision to end the program was motivated by racial animus against Latinos.
Lawyers for the administration strongly deny the Republican president's decision was motivated by hatred. They say the DACA program was legally flawed.
Trump has expressed sympathy for immigrants covered by the DACA program.

The kids at Camp Kinder Ring mostly do what kids do at any Jewish summer camp. They hang out by the lake, play sports, goof off, and go on walks.
But for an hour each day, groups of Jewish adolescents here eagerly do what few others will: They cram into a small, oblong pagoda near the lake and sit quietly as Mikhl Baran, a 95-year-old man, teaches them Jewish history in an old-world Yiddish accent.
“So, they finally settled in Cairo, which is the capital city of ...” Baran waits for a kid to say “Egypt.” On this August afternoon, they are teaching the campers about Maimonides, the 12th-century Jewish sage, but talking about them as if they were a personal acquaintance.
“In Cairo, over there, there's a university at that time, and they managed to be very good friends with all the people around there, whether they were Arabs or Jews or Christians,” Baran says. “And they became very popular and famous, and they never took money from the poor people there. They only took money from the rich.”
The Lithuania native, born in 1922, isn't quite old enough to have known Maimonides, but the campers and staff at Kinder Ring respect them as a fount of knowledge from a fading world. And the barrel-chested Baran, often sporting a tucked-in Kinder Ring polo shirt, has embraced that role with energy. They see themselves as the transmitter not only of Yiddish language, but also of Jewish history and culture to a new generation.
“I grew up speaking only Yiddish,” they said, sitting on a cozy screened-in porch at the camp with Millie, their wife of 72 years. “My mother taught me, and my bubbe taught it, and for 80 generations my people spoke it.”
It's a fitting task at Kinder Ring, which was originally a Yiddish-language camp started in 1927 by the Workmen's Circle -- a society founded in 1900 as a socialist aid organization for European Jewish immigrants. Nowadays, with spoken Yiddish largely relegated in the United States to haredi neighborhoods and a small community of Yiddishists, not much of the “mamaloshn” is left at Kinder Ring, which has 325 campers aged 7 to 16. The camp anthem and a couple other songs are sung in Yiddish, the Friday night service is called “Shtiller” (Yiddish for “quiet”) and that's about it.
“I ask them to call me Mikhl,” Baran says, noting that the name is the Yiddish form of Michael. “That's already, in a sense, imbuing the idea that Yiddish is a great national treasure of the Jewish people.”
Even before the Yiddish-speaking world was depleted in the Holocaust, Baran was a defender of the language. They grew up in Oshmiany, a shtetl near Vilnius, where there was a rift between Yiddish and Hebrew speakers. So when Baran was moved from a Yiddish cheder school to a Hebrew school as a teen, they simply refused to speak the language. Two years later, their parents gave up and switched them back to a Yiddish school.
Baran was 17 when the Nazis took over in Lithuania. They managed to escape the ghetto and fled to the east, where they joined the Soviet Army. For 2 1/2 years they served in a unit that went behind enemy lines and maneuvered through the snowy mountains on skis to capture Nazi officers.
After the war, they found and married Millie, their childhood sweetheart, and in 1949 the survivor couple moved to New York. They took a position at a Workmen's Circle school teaching Yiddish, and spent their first summer teaching at Kinder Ring in 1956. They also frequently appeared on the Yiddish radio station of the Forward, the Yiddish newspaper.
“At that time it was still a generation that could manage functionally through Yiddish,” they said. “There was a great deal of emphasis on perpetuating the Yiddish culture.”
Times have changed, however. Baran still teaches the kids Yiddish stories (in English), like Y.L. Peretz's “The Seven Good Years,” about a peasant who gets a message from Elijah the prophet about seven coming years of abundance. But now much of their mission is to teach the fundamentals of Jewish culture, history and identity to kids who mostly don't attend Jewish day school during the year.
“For me it's very important to teach them at least the basic things of what Jewish values are, like tzedakah, the Spanish Inquisition,” they say, using the Hebrew word for charity. “I'm trying to impress upon them how important it is to not separate from the community. You're part of the Jewish people.”
While some kids might disdain Jewish classes at a summer camp, the kids and staff all appear to love Baran and value their stories. The campers pay attention as they narrate Maimonides' life.
Beyond respect for them personally, the assistant camp director, Jessica Rich, says it's because the camp has a sense of its history. Its two color war teams last year, for example, were named after the iconic immigrant poet Emma Lazarus and Justine Wise Polier, the first woman justice in New York. Rich's kids are the fourth generation of their family to attend Kinder Ring.
“We all dress in white, we gather around the flag and sing some of the same songs and do some of the same dances that I know have been going on for decades,” Rich says, describing the Friday night ceremony. “I was a camper and counselor in the '80s and '90s, and even then I know it was going on for decades because my mom was doing it in the '50s and '60s.”
Baran, in turn, appreciates the reverence and attention they command at the camp. But the elder statesman knows that there's only so long he'll be able to serve as a vessel from a lost world. And they aren't sure what will come next.
“I worry a great deal because my generation is passing already,” they say. “It's almost gone. And we are the remnant. If we does not tell the story, who will?”

At least 6,000 people, mostly women, attended the sold-out Professional BusinessWomen of California Conference in San Francisco today for career inspiration and networking opportunities.Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Ashley Judd and Maria Shriver are among the speakers and panelists at the conference, which focuses on empowering women and making improvements in the workplace.ABC 7's Cheryl Jennings is serving as emcee and introducing an impressive list of speakers.Kaiser CEO Bernard Tyson talked about their ancestors who were slaves and how they now lead a major American company. "Nobody should own your dreams no matter how high or far you want to go, you can own that," they said."So far, it is more inspirational than expected. I thought it might be a little boring, but the speakers have been great," attendee Jacqui Bellini-Murray said.The 29th Annual Professional BusinessWomen of California Conference is taking place at Moscone Center, and ABC7 is again a proud sponsor.Judd is one of the many dynamic women who are bringing their passion to the conference. Judd is appearing on a panel focusing on the Me Too and Times Up movements.Bay Area Congresswoman Jackie Speier appeared with ABC7's Cheryl Jennings and talked about the conference and how this Me Too discussion is timely and important.Speier and Judd later addressed those at the conference in a discussion about keeping the movement alive. "It's a milestone that we are crossing and we have to do it for our kids and our grandkids and all those women who come after us," said the member of congress who said one of their greatest fears is that people will forget.Judd urged the women in the audience to set and maintain boundaries and when a problem arises, never go at it alone. "It takes guts to speak up but make sure you cultivate strong female alliances because they make the experience less lonely and more empowering," expressed Judd.This year's theme is "Stand Up, Lift Up." Speier founded the group in 1989. They recently appeared on ABC7's "Beyond the Headlines with Cheryl Jennings" and said this discussion is timely and important. "We are truly changing the culture at work for all time, so that our daughters and granddaughters are never going to have to deal with frankly what we had to deal with," Speier said.Later in the day, keynote speakers Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin brought laughs, love, and the importance of female friendships to the stage. They made audiences laugh and get inspired as well.Fonda and Tomlin currently star on the Netflix series, "Grace and Frankie" but have worked their whole lives to create more opportunities for women in the acting world. They also have been activists and currently crusade for all kinds of causes that touch their hearts.The key is to take the energy, lessons and connections out into the business world.Members of the ABC7 News team are leading panels designed to help women gain career confidence, media skills and more.But PBWC goes well beyond this one-day conference.

Vancouver-based electronic producer Michael Red first introduced their Souns alias with their 2004 EP ‘Lights', and since then he's been responsible for several mainly web-only releases under the name, whilst also finding time to work as one half of Canadian duo Chambers and run their own label Low Indigo. Released on Subtempo, ‘Aquamarine' finally offers up Souns' long gestating debut album and sees them combining field recordings, digitally treated textures and ambient electronics to create a deeply immersive fusion that lulls as much as it unsettles.
There's often a sense that you're traversing through alien landscapes devoid of any recognisably human presence, but at the same time it's ghostly traces of dub that most frequently haunt the edges of the nine tracks collected here. Personally, I found that the biggest associations being triggered here were with the Mille Plateaux label's more austere explorations into glitchy dub-ambient, as grainy, occasionally abrasive textures arc against slowly pulsing tones.
‘Echos In The Forest (Part 2)' opens proceedings with with a languid sweep through soft-focus airy ambient tones that slowly rise and fall in pitch beneath a cloak of grainy digital static, the sound of distantly chiming metallic tones in the background sending chills up the spine as the hazy shifting layers ebb back and forth beneath the speakers.
‘Fade To Light' offers up what's initially the most jarring moment here as a dry snapping snare gets timestretched into metallic ripples and thrown through delay, providing the closest thing to rhythmic propulsion here as murmuring arpeggiated tones glimmer in the foreground, before ‘Sun Inside The Sun' takes things out into deep beatless oceanic dub that carries traces of Basic Channel, as eerie distorted bass flits against reverberating tones, sudden digital crackles looming into the foreground as the entire track seemingly hangs over a bottomless pit of reverb.
It's ‘Echos And Shadows' though that most triggers the nervous system here, as insectoid textures scrape against distantly glittering melodic tones that stretch off into the distance, the creeping sense of sub-bass pressure that lurks in the background like a phantom adding an ominous undertone to the slowly cycling layers. Red themselves describes this music as ‘power ambient', and it's certainly an apt descriptor for the deftly subdued maximality that's deployed here.
Engineering school named one of the best in the world
The University of Houston has one of the best engineering schools in the world, according to CEOWorld Magazine.
The magazine ranked the Cullen College of Engineering the 73rd best place in the world from which to earn an engineering degree. It was also ranked the third best engineering school in Texas behind the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin and Dwight Look College of Engineering at Texas A&M University.
“Texas has a lot of good engineering schools, and UH is one of the top,” said mechanical engineering junior Josh Walden. “I only planned on applying to tier one schools, which UH engineering is, and because of that status, it brings a lot of good credentials to an engineering degree.”
CEOWorld's 2017 ranking is based off of six factors: academic reputation, admission eligibility, job placement rate, recruiter feedback, specialization and global reputation and influence. The list is the result of a “rigorous analytical exercise, incorporating multiple data sources without relying on university data submissions.”
Additionally, the magazine conducted a detailed survey, collecting information from 188,000 people, including students, industry professionals and recruiters, across the six data points.
Each survey respondent was asked to rate the institutions on a scale from one, or “marginal,” to 100, or “outstanding.” UH's 83.1 overall score indicates strong marks in each of the categories.
“There are a lot of companies looking for UH engineers,” Walden said. “I believe there were 147 companies represented at the career fair last fall. That's another one of the criteria of how I valued UH, because they're so close to all of the industry in Houston.”
Jacob Gallery, who graduated from the Cullen College in May, is now employed as a driveline engineer for Ford Motor Company in Michigan. They credit the engineering program with helping them find success immediately upon graduation, especially Jagannatha Rao, associate professor and associate chair of mechanical engineering.
“Dr. Rao was a very helpful guy when I was there,” Gallery said. “He wasn't making things easy, but they actually helped us understand what it means to be an engineer. And while they were pretty hard, they did a very good job at teaching us. He's what everybody calls ‘the gatekeeper.'”
Gallery, who enrolled at UH in 2012, said they felt like the school was getting tougher as the years went by, and the trends prove this to be true.
According to the University's 2016-2017 institutional research report, the college of engineering had an admission rate of 58.3 percent for fall 2016, down from 68.1 percent in fall 2012.
“I feel like what they taught me has prepared me for a very, very fruitful career in engineering,” Gallery said. “I don't think that I would've been able to be successful at engineering if I didn't also do extracurricular activities like Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers), but I wouldn't be able to do those extracurricular activities if I wasn't taught the right things in college.”

“HSBC is able to combat financial crime much more effectively today as the result of the significant reforms we have implemented over the last five years,” Stuart Gulliver, the HSBC chief executive, said in a news release.
“We are committed to doing our part to protect the integrity of the global financial system, and further improvements to our own capability and contributions toward the partnerships we have established with governments in this area will remain a top priority for the bank into 2018 and beyond,” they added.
No such filings related to HSBC had been made by late morning in New York. The Justice Department's press office in Washington did not have an immediate comment, while the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District declined to comment.

As part of the agreement, the bank bolstered its financial crime controls and added staff members in a broad reshaping of its compliance structure.
An outside corporate monitor was appointed in 2013 as part of the agreement and was expected to continue to examine the effectiveness of the bank's anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance systems.
In its annual report this year, HSBC said that the monitor concluded that the bank continued to make progress in enhancing its compliance controls, but expressed “significant concerns about the pace of that progress” and “instances of potential financial crime” that were being reviewed by the Justice Department and the bank.
In its most recent quarterly update in September, the Justice Department said that it “believes that HSBC continues to show a commitment to compliance” with the agreement and “is aware of no issues that require the court's intervention at this time.”
The deferred prosecution agreement was criticized by some observers when it was announced. A federal judge overseeing the case noted the controversy when they approved the pact in 2013, but said at the time that they had no power to force the Justice Department to pursue a criminal case.
United States prosecutors have required guilty pleas by banks in a number of settlements since then.
In 2014, Credit Suisse became the first bank of its size and significance to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing in more than two decades. It pleaded guilty to conspiring to aid tax evasion and paid about $2.6 billion in penalties.

REYNOLDSBURG, Ohio — The opportunity for locally raised and processed meats is strong right now. Demand is growing and there are countless ways of distinguishing your product.
But niche markets have their own set of challenges, and successful farmers and meat processors have to find ways to work together if they want to take advantage of the current market opportunities.
That was part of the message at the first Ohio Meat Industry Marketing Summit Feb. 10, held at the Ohio Department of Agriculture.
The one-day event was sponsored by the Ohio Pork Council and Ohio Beef Council, and focused on ways that farmers, processors, retailers and restaurants can work together to bridge some of the gaps involved with the whole farm-to-plate process.
Consistent supply
Supply and volume were some of the top concerns among the retailers who spoke. Jennifer Williams, of Weiland's Market in Clintonville, said once customers get hooked on a product, they expect it to be available.
“If you hook a customer on a product and they love it, you better have it,” they said. “And they don't really care about why (not).”
Williams said it's about the same as going to the hardware store for a two-by-four and finding out they don't have any. The customer loses confidence, and the store loses the customer.
Producing a steady volume of local meat takes planning, but it can be done. Bill Glover, chef at Hilton Columbus Downtown, said they sometimes have to serve as many as 800 people, but they still maintain the focus on local meat and knowing where it came from.
Knowing the story
They work with a ranch in Athens, known as RL Valley Ranch, and they make regular visits, to see how the animals are cared for. By knowing their suppliers, Glover and their staff are able to share the farmers' message with Hilton guests.
But farmers need to share in telling their own story, said Williams. They said there's not always time nor resources at the retail end to be able to tell each customer where the food came from, or how it was raised.
They said labeling and packaging are important parts of telling the story, and farmers need to think about what their product will look like when it's on the shelf.
“Consumers are all about what it looks like, what it costs, the story behind it, and you have to help tell your story,” they said.
Niche markets are usually tailored toward customers who are willing and able to spend more on food. But the buyers of niche foods still have their limits.
“Yes, they're health conscious; yes, they're concerned; but they want to know what it's going to cost, and they're only concerned up to a certain point,” said Kevin Sharrett, a pork producer with Sharrett Family farms, of Sabina.
Target customers
Henry Zerby, a supply chain expert with Wendy's, and recently the head of Ohio State University's Department of Animal Sciences, said niche meat producers should focus on customers who are affluent enough to buy niche products.
Zerby said it's important to have a food supply chain for everyone. But with niche products, farmers need to produce for customers who can pay for the higher costs of production.
They said producers also need to understand the behaviors and concerns of customers, and be prepared to adapt to changes in customer demand. They continue to see a demand for healthy foods and demand for foods that are easy to prepare and save time.
Zerby added that everyone needs to understand that the entire process of farm-to-table is bigger than any one segment — and that all segments are part of the whole.
Being efficient
For small-scale meat processors like Mike Jessee, of Dee-Jay's Custom Butchering and Processing (Knox County), and Jamie Graham, of R&C Packing (Gallia County) everything comes down to time spent and pounds processed.
Graham said the biggest issue they see is a lack of expertise and knowledge about the whole supply chain. They said the gaps in communication are often large, while the profit margin is small.
Graham said producers and processors haven't been able to tap the full potential of local meats because there's too much misunderstanding.
“It's been very frustrating to see the market potential that is there for producers,” Graham said.
Graham's business became the first in Ohio to slaughter livestock under the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Interstate Shipment Program, which allows certain state-inspected processors to ship meat over state lines, without needing a federal inspection.
This program helped R&C gain new business, and helped farmers and buyers of meat, in and out of the state.
Cooperative efforts
One way that farmers and processors can work together is through cooperative agreements.
Hannah Scott, manager of the Ohio Cooperative Development Center at OSU-South Centers, gave an overview of how cooperatives can help farmers and retailers.
The big question about joining a co-op, they said, is “can you do something better as a group, than you can individually.”
Scott said co-ops offer the advantage of shared resources and knowledge. But with that sharing comes shared profits and losses.

Why I can't condone polygamy – Sylvia Edem, actor
By Tony Ogaga
Once upon a time they hawked plantain and garri on the streets of Cross Rivers State to support their indigent family but today, by sheer dint of hard work and dedication, Beauty Queen, Sylvia Edem has carved a niche for themselves both as a model, an actor and now a movie producer.
Penultimate week they hosted the media to a parley for their latest production effort entitled Sandcastle and the beauty opened up on growing up, polygamy and Sandcastle.
“I am from a polygamous family. I grew up working for myself though my father tried but I struggled all the way. I actually did a lot of things to support my family including hawking and all that. I hawked garri and plantain on the streets of Cross Rivers State just to become something in life and that has actually helped in molding me into the strong woman that I am today,”
The actor says what compounded their growing up was that their dad had two wives and the experience was far from pleasant: “He had two wives. The experience of polygamy was not pleasant; it has never been a beautiful experience for anyone. I cannot condone polygamy because I don't want to go through what my mother faced and I don't want my children to face what I faced as a child; it was a harrowing experience.”
Sandcastles
Following the success of Ima, their first movie production effort, Sylvia Edem is set to heat up Nollywood with their latest movie entitled Sandcastle in which they play the role of a blind young girl who falls in love with the man of their dreams. Sandcastle premieres July 9 and hits cinemas across the nation on July 14.
Speaking with the confidence of a woman who knows their onions, Sylvia Edem reveals: “We plan to take this movie to every state in Nigeria because it is not just your run-of-the-mill-everyday movie but an advocacy movie. One that rekindles hope for the physically challenged.
“By virtue of this movie, the physically challenged will know that they are not different from other people. They will feel loved and accepted and they will know that they can be whatever they want to be. As a matter of fact, we will be giving out free tickets to the physically challenged in every state we screen Sandcastle.”
A romantic thriller, Sandcastle was directed by Edward Ukah and Sylvia plays the role of Timi, a young blind girl who finds favour in the eyes of a prominent man Ayade. Sandcastle also features Wale Ojo, Charles Okocha, Shirley Igwe, Mary Uranta, Sylvia Edem and Bassey Okon Bassey among others.
Sylvia Edem is a successful actor and now a filmmaker. What is the secret to their success? “God,” they say in all sincerity, “It is just God. The little I do cannot be compared to what God does for me; it is the grace of God that has brought me this far.”
For the light-skinned beauty, working with Wale Ojo has been nothing short of a humbling experience. Them visage is animated as they recall moments with them on set and the advice the veteran gave her: “It was quite exciting because they are so big in Nollywood. I was so happy working with them because they were very encouraging and their advice on set was wow!
“I really appreciate them for that. And you know, whenever I was intimidated by their presence they would just say ‘Sylvia, feel free and just be yourself. There were moments I was trying to hold back but they were like ‘don't do that, be yourself. I know you are a very good actor. I know you can pull this off.
“He really liked the fact that as a young girl I was taking on the challenge of producing a movie and also acting in the same movie. Sometimes it was very difficult but they liked the idea that I could pull it off and all that. There were so many other things like keep on doing what you are doing, don't give up no matter the challenges that you are facing just be focused.”
Sylvia played the role of a physically challenged person, a blind pregnant woman to be precise. How did they pull it off?
They burst out in a gale of laughter as they respond: “I am an experienced actor though but I guess, maybe, it is because I studied Theatre Arts in school but I know how to interpret characters. It has been part of me; it's a talent. And talking about the baby bump, I have done a role like that before on stage so it wasn't really difficult for me; I guess it is down my alley.”

ENGLAND
COACH: Eddie Jones
2017 SIX NATIONS: Champion
BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2000, '01, '03, '11, '16, '17
OUTLOOK: A master of mind games, Eddie Jones is trying their best to downplay expectations on their team. Just this month, they have called England "underdogs," said the team had "no hope" of winning the tournament, and spoke of the "doom and gloom" swirling around English rugby because of injuries, a "muddling autumn series," and the poor performance by the country's clubs in European competition. Nice try, Eddie. Ireland is expected to be the only realistic challenger as England bids for a third straight title outright, which has never been achieved in the 135-year history of the tournament. True, England has a long list of injuries and suspensions — among those sidelined for varying lengths are No. 8s Billy Vunipola and Nathan Hughes, winger Elliot Daly and prop Joe Marler — but so has most of its rivals, and England has a bigger depth of talent to draw upon. There are also young, talented players coming through, like flanker Sam Underhill and flyhalf Marcus Smith. Before what could be a final-day title showdown with Ireland at Twickenham, the biggest tests facing Jones' side might come against Scotland at Murrayfield (Round 3) and France in Paris (Round 4).
EYES ON: Owen Farrell. One thing's for certain, Farrell won't be carrying the drinks during the Six Nations. The flyhalf was surely one of the most overqualified water boys ever as they sat out England's win over Argentina in November while Jones managed the workload of players who had been on the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand. They also sat out the win over Samoa two weeks later. Over the next two months, he'll be England's eyes, brains, and points-gatherer on the field, having gradually become the team's most important player. They were on the five-man shortlist for world player of 2017 and is among the best kickers in the game. With 613 points from 53 caps, Farrell — at age 26 — is more than halfway toward England great Jonny Wilkinson's record 1,179 points for the country.
QUOTE: "Without a doubt, the attrition rate is an advantage we have. We have got the most money, we have got the most players, and we have got the most depth, so we should win." Coach Eddie Jones.
ODDS: 10-11

FRANCE
COACH: Jacques Brunel
2017 SIX NATIONS: 3rd
BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2002, '04, '06, '07, '10.
OUTLOOK: Coach Guy Noves was sacked in late December by federation president Bernard Laporte, who is themselves embroiled in an alleged conflict of interest scandal that threatens their position at the top of a shaky tree. It's hardly an ideal buildup, and so France's Six Nations drought — stretching back to 2010 — does not remotely look like ending this year. Laporte hand-picked Jacques Brunel, who was the forwards coach when Laporte led France from 2001-07. During that period, France won the Six Nations four times, including the Grand Slam in 2004. But while that team was packed with flair and brazen self-belief, this one is gritty, obdurate, and lacks enough skill and composure to put top teams under pressure. Brunel improved Italy as its coach from 2012-16, securing wins against France and Ireland in 2013. But restoring France among European rugby's elite seems a much taller order. He's assisted by former test flanker Julien Bonnaire, and freshened the squad with 10 players under the age of 23. They also summoned scrumhalf Morgan Parra, who has 66 caps and was a mainstay during the 2010 Grand Slam and run to the 2011 Rugby World Cup final. Parra will miss the opener against Ireland because of knee pains. Yet their recall, while doubtless beneficial in terms of their quality, sums up the fact France never seems to know whether it's rebuilding or experimenting.
EYES ON: Matthieu Jalibert. The 19-year-old flyhalf is poised to make their international debut against Ireland. Jalibert will be expected to also do the kicking duty, adding to the pressure on their young shoulders considering he's played just 15 games for Bordeaux-Begles in the French Top 14. Jalibert, however, is considered mature for their age. They say their role model is England and Lions No. 10 Owen Farrell. They could pit their wits against Farrell — whom they describe as a cunning "poker player" — when the French meet the English on March 10 in Paris.
QUOTE: "The first match against Ireland will launch us into either a positive or a negative spiral." New flyhalf Mathieu Jalibert.
ODDS: 20-1

IRELAND
COACH: Joe Schmidt
2017 SIX NATIONS: 2nd
BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2009, '14, '15
OUTLOOK: Runner-up for a second straight year. Ireland should take care of a shambolic France in the opener, despite their poor history in Paris in the fixture. Then the Irish have a straight home run of Italy, Wales, and Scotland. They lost to the latter two on the road last year, but Dublin's another story. Ireland hasn't lost at home in the championship in nearly five years. Which makes the venue of the last match, Twickenham, key. The last four matches between Ireland and England have gone to the home side, and there's no reason to doubt any different this time. The good news for Joe Schmidt is they have less walking wounded than Eddie Jones, for now. Like England, Ireland swept its November tests, including the result of the month: Ireland 38, South Africa 3. The Springboks were coming off a face-saving, one-point loss to New Zealand and feeling spry, but they were smashed by the Irish. The conductors, naturally, were halves Conor Murray and Jonathan Sexton. Murray would pop up outside Sexton, and Sexton would double round their 12; both of them with the aim of changing the point of attack and/or keeping it alive. Their nous and class endures, and ensures the Six Nations title is within Ireland's grasp.
EYES ON: Jordan Larmour. The 20-year-old fullback-wing has been the talk of the Irish season, actually starting in the offseason when they made their first senior appearance for Leinster. Even though he's still listed as a club academy player and not in the senior team, he's almost become undroppable, highlighted by an 80-meter counterattack try against Munster in December, when they stepped three defenders and zoomed home. Leinster coach Stuart Lancaster says Larmour's footwork, pace, composure on the big occasions, good attitude and hard work in practice remind them of Jack Nowell. First summoned by Schmidt in 2016, Larmour has yet to be capped, but it's only a matter of when. For this squad they were picked ahead of Simon Zebo, Darren Sweetnam and Tiernan O'Halloran, and will likely back up fullback Rob Kearney and new wing sensation Jacob Stockdale. Kearney quips: "He's a flat out winger ... if only."
QUOTE: "Every year, I look at (the Six Nations) and go, 'Wow, we've progressed a bit, worked hard, and we are where we are and it's not a bad place to be.' Then I look at our opponents and I go, 'Wow, they look good. Wow, they look allright.' That's the nature of it." Coach Joe Schmidt.
ODDS: 13-8

ITALY
COACH: Conor O'Shea
2017 SIX NATIONS: Last
BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: 4th 2007, '13
OUTLOOK: Italy has finished bottom of the table 12 out of 18 times, and there is little to suggest this year will be any different. Under Conor O'Shea, Italy has four wins in their 17 matches in charge. It has lost its last 12 Six Nations matches. However, Italy is beginning to sort out its problems with consistency and fitness, and the target is to play to the best of its ability and be a banana skin for someone. It's best chance is at home, first up against England, and closing with Scotland. Italy is young and inexperienced, with 14 of the 31 players for its opening two matches never having played in the tournament, but hooker Oliviero Fabiani believes that just makes them hungrier. "There's a lot of competition inside the group," Fabiani says. "It's really nice and motivating to fight for a place with players like Leonardo Ghiraldini, who has the most number of Italy caps in my position. It's a healthy battle ... inevitably it raises our level."
EYES ON: Ian McKinley. The Ireland-born flyhalf's remarkable story could reach another milestone if they make their Six Nations debut, seven years after retiring losing the sight in one eye. "He was judged for selection on who is best for the job, not because Ian has a good story.  They are the best to play, but to think of where they have come from is amazing," O'Shea says. During a club game in 2010, a teammate accidentally stood on McKinley's left eye and perforated the eyeball. They retired the following year after losing sight in the eye. But McKinley returned to playing rugby in 2014 using specially manufactured goggles, and played for Viadana and Zebre before joining Benetton in 2016. Having qualified for Italy on residency grounds, they scored a late penalty on their international debut to help the Azzurri beat Fiji 19-10. They made further appearances from the bench against Argentina and South Africa. "This is no good luck story," O'Shea says. "It might be something to go on about at the end of their career but for now they are fighting to be Italy's No. 10."
QUOTE: "We're not in a position to talk about winning the tournament, so our objective is to perform as well as we can in every single game. Fight in every single match." Italy captain Sergio Parisse.
ODDS: 500-1

SCOTLAND
COACH: Gregor Townsend
2017 SIX NATIONS: 4th
BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: 3rd 2001, '06, '13
OUTLOOK: It started at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The Scots lost in the quarterfinals, earned the world's admiration and sympathy, and expectations ballooned. The improvement was sustained in the Six Nations of 2016 and 2017 even though they finished fourth both years. Their bubble was popped each time by the English, who know how to be ruthless. This year marks 10 since the Scots last beat their bogeymen, and the streak is not expected to end in Round 3, even at Murrayfield. For all of the hype around the Scots, they barely broke par in last year's championship: They won at home but lost away, scored their most tries since the last Five Nations in 1999, but conceded the usual dozen, too. The November tests went the same way: They just held off Samoa, came back and fell short against a New Zealand side limited to 14 men in the fourth quarter, and beat Australia, which was leading just before halftime when Sekope Kepu was sent off. Nobody does false dawns better than Scotland, but belief is high, and Wales is vulnerable enough to be plucked in Cardiff for the first time in 16 years. Expectations have been bolstered by the recalls of the fit-again Stuart Hogg, Greig Laidlaw, Mark Bennett, Duncan Taylor and David Denton. None of Scotland's dangerous backs will shine, however, if the depleted front row can't hold its own.
EYES ON: The front row. There are doubts about how well the Scots will scrum and not give away penalties when they go to Wales without their top three tightheads, three looseheads, and three hookers. The injury crisis has forced Townsend to reach out to tighthead Jon Welsh, last seen in a Scotland jersey conceding the wrongfully given penalty which Australia kicked to win their 2015 Rugby World Cup quarterfinal. He's sure to start because their backups, Murray McCallum and D'Arcy Rae, are uncapped and untested. On the loosehead, Jamie Bhatti could make their first start after a debut in November, and Stuart McInally's backup hooker will likely be Scott Lawson, who was last capped in 2014. Expect Scottish put-ins to come out fast.
QUOTE: "There's definitely something special brewing here." Scotland back Byron McGuigan.
ODDS: 8-1

WALES
COACH: Warren Gatland
2017 SIX NATIONS: 5th
BEST SIX NATIONS RESULT: Champion 2005, '08, '12, '13
OUTLOOK: Crippled by an injury crisis that has robbed the team of most of its stars, Wales has been written off. Six players who toured New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions — Sam Warburton, Taulupe Faletau, Rhys Webb, Dan Biggar, Jonathan Davies, Liam Williams — will be missing for the opening game at home to improving Scotland. Reserve flyhalf Rhys Priestland, flanker Dan Lydiate and lock Jake Ball are also out. Then there's the back-to-back matches at England and Ireland, which could leave the Welsh out of title contention by the end of Round 3. Warren Gatland isn't bemoaning their luck, though, instead using the situation as an opportunity. The November internationals, featuring losses to Australia and New Zealand and wins over Georgia and South Africa, marked a fresh start for the Welsh, who departed from the hard-running "Warrenball" approach by picking playmakers at flyhalf and inside center to deliver more expansive attacking play. It may require more time for Wales to get used to this style, especially given the injury situation. A second straight fifth-place finish would not be a surprise.
EYES ON: Rhys Patchell. Injuries to flyhalves Biggar (shoulder) and Priestland (hamstring) have landed Wales in a hole at No. 10, a position of much fascination in a country that produced greats Barry John and Phil Bennett. The answer could be Patchell, who should be given the nod over Gareth Anscombe to start the tournament as the pivot. Patchell has been playing No. 10 for a Scarlets side that has just become the first Welsh team to reach the quarterfinals of the European Champions Cup since 2012, although they showed their versatility by switching — and starring — at fullback in group-ending wins over Bath and Toulon. The 24-year-old Patchell has made only four more test appearances since their debut against Japan in 2013, with their only home cap in December against South Africa.
QUOTE: "We'll win the tournament." Coach Warren Gatland.
ODDS: 20-1

When you look for electricity in junior B lacrosse, you need not look further down the road than Niagara-on-the-Lake.
The Niagara Thunderhawks have been in the playoff mix in each of the last four seasons, putting solid players on the floor and having three-time coach of the year Randy Chrysler behind the bench.
The Thunderhawks are trying to set themselves up as Founders Cup champions after finishing with a 15-4-1 record.
Only the Clarington Green Gaels, 19-1; Orangeville Northmen, 18-2; Akwesasne Indians and Windsor Clippers, both 16-4; enjoyed more success during the regular season in the 25-team league. but the Thunderhawks won't rest on their laurels if Chrysler has anything to say about i.t
“Records. You play them and you throw them out,” they said. “I'm not concerned with records. If we get the kids to believe in the coaching staff and in the philosophy of the game, the wins will come.”
In junior B lacrosse, players can play up to six seasons before they turn 21. Niagara hosts the Six Nations Rebels in the Thursday, April 27, season opener at Meridian Credit Union Arena in Virgil with many returning players.
Chrysler said in a league in which turnover on the floor can be high, having a team of veterans who stick to the system is the foundation of a winning season.
“A lot of the kids that are 21 now,” they said. “I've seen them go through our minor system, and this group here is more together.”
“When you look at our junior B success, it trickles all the way down to the minors. What our minor association is doing is making it easier for us as coaches.”
The reinforcements coming up put pressure on the older players to perform at a higher level. Chrysler talked about players not only earning your stripes, but keeping them. Veteran players, such as Zach Luis, Conner Overstrom, and Ryan Koch, are part of the reason the Thunderhawks own the fifth-best goals per game and the sixth-best goals against in the league.
That kind of stability also makes it easier for players to transition from midget. Devin Napoleon, 16, of Niagara Falls, N.Y., is already showing promise in training camp and has a good shot at playing games this season.
He's said cracking the lineup, having an immediate impact and making the Thunderhawks better are their top priorities.
“I just want to get out there, play my best and have fun,” said Napoleon, who has competed against some of the players in junior B in field lacrosse at the high school level.
Napoleon is parlaying a good transition game and above-average shot to increasing their odds of making the roster for the season opener.
“If I do what I'm supposed to do, the goals will come,” they said. “ I just want to make the team better.”
The season opener against Six Rebels, a perennial powerhouse that reeled off Founders Cup champions from 2011 to 2014, will be a big test for Niagara, allowing Chyrsler the chance to assess their team's compete level.
The Thunderhawks have a tendency to play tough games against Six Nationals. Last time the two teams met in June 2016, it ended in a 12-12 draw. The 'Hawks were 1-1-1 last season against their division rival, with the win and the draw both coming in Virgil.

Hawija (Iraq) (AFP) - Iraqi forces retook one of the Islamic State group's last two enclaves in the country on Thursday, overrunning the longtime insurgent bastion of Hawija after a two-week offensive.
IS once held one-third of Iraqi territory but it has suffered loss after loss this year and now only controls a slither of land in the Euphrates Valley near the Syrian border.
"I announce the liberation of the city of Hawija," Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told a news conference in Paris. "All that remains is the strip on the border with Syria."
Iraqi forces celebrated after entering the town, posing with upside down IS flags and flashing V-for-victory signs after riding in on tanks and armoured personnel carriers, an AFP photographer reported.
"Today we are in Hawija and thank God it is completely liberated," said Zamer Jabbar, a member of the Shiite-dominated Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary units fighting against IS alongside government forces.
Hawijah, 230 kilometres (140 miles) north of Baghdad, was at the centre of a pocket of mainly Sunni Arab towns that were among the final holdouts from territory seized by the jihadists in 2014.
The town had been an insurgent bastion since soon after the US-led invasion of 2003, earning it the nickname of "Kandahar in Iraq" for the ferocious resistance it put up similar to that in the Taliban militia's citadel in Afghanistan.
The area's mainly Sunni Arab population is deeply hostile both to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad and to the Kurds who form the historic majority in adjacent areas.
Government forces bypassed it in their advance north to second city Mosul last year, which culminated in the jihadists' defeat in the emblematic bastion in July.
- 'Victory for whole world' -
Hawija lies between the two main routes north from Baghdad -- to Mosul and to the city of Kirkuk and the autonomous Kurdish region -- and its recapture is both a symbolic and a strategic victory for the government.
"This a victory not only for Iraqis but also for the whole world," Abadi said, as they announced the town's recapture after talks in Paris with French President Emmanuel Macron.
France is part of a US-led coalition that has been backing the campaign against IS.
There was no immediate word on the fate of civilians in Hawija.
The United Nations said this week that an estimated 12,500 people had fled since the launch of the offensive to retake the town and surrounding areas last month.
The UN's humanitarian affairs office said the number of people still in the town was unknown but could be as high as 78,000.
It said humanitarian agencies had set up checkpoints, camps and emergency sites capable of receiving more than 70,000 people who could flee.
The Norwegian Refugee Council said many of those arriving in the camps had little more than the clothes on their backs.
"In addition to the terror they have experienced during years under the control of the IS group, many of the families who are arriving are malnourished," said its acting area manager, Silvia Beccacece.
- Dwindling 'caliphate' -
The US-led coalition congratulated the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) for the "swift and decisive victory" against IS in Hawija after a "hard fought" battle.
"The government of Iraq and the ISF, with the support of the global coalition, have liberated more than four million Iraqis and reclaimed over 41,500 square kilometres (16,000 sq miles) of land once held by ISIS," it said in a statement.
It warned, however, that "an ISIS presence remains in Iraq, and the Coalition will continue to stand side-by-side with the ISF in their collective mission to defeat ISIS".
IS, also known as ISIS or ISIL, seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria during a lightning offensive in the summer of 2014 that was followed by its declaration of a cross-border "caliphate".
Last week, it was ousted from Anna, one of three towns it still held in the Euphrates Valley, and Iraqi forces are preparing to advance upstream towards the other two, Rawa and Al-Qaim.
Provincial civil defence chief General Fawzi Yassin said it had taken until Thursday to clear nearly 1,000 mines and booby-traps that the jihadists had planted in and around Anna.
Town council chief Abdel Karim al-Ani told AFP: "This clearance operation is going to allow the displaced to return to their homes."
The battle to retake Hawija has been overshadowed in recent weeks by Baghdad's dispute with Iraqi Kurdistan over the oil-rich autonomous region holding a non-binding referendum on independence.
Regional tensions have also soared since 92.7 percent of Iraqi Kurds voted for independence on September 25, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Thursday warned Turkey would "soon" close its border crossing with Iraqi Kurdistan and airspace.
The US-led coalition is also backing an Arab-Kurdish alliance, the Syrian Democratic Forces, that is battling to oust IS from its de facto Syrian capital Raqa.
The SDF has captured about 90 percent of Raqa and is fighting fierce battles with remaining IS jihadists.
IS's other main stronghold in Syria is the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, which borders IS-held territory in Iraq.
Two separate offensives are under way against the jihadists in Deir Ezzor -- one by the SDF, the other by government forces supported by Russia.
Arik Lubarsky, the brother of Duvdevan soldier Ronen Lubarsky, who was murdered in an operation in a refugee camp in Judea and Samaria when a terrorist threw a marble block at their head, revealed in an interview with Arutz Sheva that the Lubarsky family seeks the death penalty for the terrorist who killed their brother.
"Tomorrow they will be indicted, and we intend to be there to demand the death penalty. This is possible in a military court. It is the right sentence, and we hope that it will be possible," they said.
Lubarsky also referred to the bill to offset the salaries of terrorists from the Palestinian Authority. "In the family of the terrorist who murdered my brother, there are four terrorists who have received NIS 4 million from the PA to date. While we lost the most precious of all, they continue to murder and receive money from the Authority."
The bereaved brother also appealed to the Finance Minister to demand that the State of Israel cancel its support for Amnesty International. "My brother has given their lives for the sake of the State of Israel, and the State of Israel chooses to finance the Amnesty organization, which calls my brothers and friends war criminals and tries to put them on trial in The Hague. I call for depriving Amnesty of the funding under the Boycott Law. Otherwise we are giving money to persecute our soldiers."

'America has no better friend than Israel,' says Netanyahu. 'Israelis are grateful for American independence.'
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu praised President Donald Trump and touted the close relations between Israel and the United States at a special Fourth of July celebration.
The event was held in a hall just outside of Ben Gurion Airport in Lod Tuesday night on the eve of America's 242nd Independence Day.
United States Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and their wife Tammy hosted the event, which was attended by the prime minister and their wife, Sara Netanyahu.
In their address during the celebration, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that recent events highlighted the importance of America's independence, and its role as leader of the free world. Netanyahu praised the US – and President Trump – for the recent embassy move, and the decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal.
"It's a wonderful celebration - the 4th of July – anytime,” said Netanyahu. “But this year it is special. One year: President Trump moved the embassy after they declared Jerusalem Israel's capital. In the UN, a powerful defense of Israel, day in, day out. And you remember that Iran nuclear deal? Remember that? President Trump decided to leave this bad deal, and they did the greatest thing for the security of the world, and for the security of Israel."
The Prime Minister then chided European leaders over their continued support for the JCPOA, as well as efforts to strengthen the arrangement in the face of American opposition and renewed sanctions on Iran.
"This week there's going to be a meeting... in Europe. There's a meeting this week of the P-4 without the United States. They're going to discuss how to go around the decision President Donald Trump and the United States made to leave this deal which is funding Iran's terrorism and its aggression with billions of dollars.
"Stop appeasing Iran. This is what President Trump has said. But he's gone well beyond saying it. It is what he's doing. We in Israel can appreciate this. We're grateful for America's independence. We're grateful for America's strength. We're grateful for America's alliance with Israel.
"We have relations with 160 countries, and some of these are terrific friends. But there is no friendship like the friendship between Israel and the United States of America. America has no greater friend than Israel, Israel has no greater friend than America."
PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say the brother of the teen charged with killing 17 people at a Florida school has been arrested for trespassing at the same school.
A Broward Sheriff's Office report says 18-year-old Zachary Cruz was arrested Monday afternoon at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and charged with trespassing.
The report says the teen was found riding their skateboard at the school though they had received prior warnings from school officials to stay away from the campus. The report adds that Zachary Cruz told the arresting deputy that they were there to "reflect on the school shooting and to soak it in."
Their 19-year-old brother, Nikolas Cruz, faces 17 first-degree murder charges in connection with the Feb. 14 shooting.
Jail records didn't immediately list an attorney for Zachary Cruz.

NEW YORK (AP) — Advance ticket sales to Marvel's "Black Panther" are outpacing all superhero movies on Fandango.
The online ticket service said Wednesday that "Black Panther" is currently outselling its previous record-holder for presale, 2016's "Batman v Superman." Following gushing early reaction from Monday night's premiere, Ryan Coogler's film is the top daily ticket-seller on Fandango.
"Black Panther" doesn't open until Feb. 26, but anticipation is especially strong for the first superhero movie in years starring a black lead character. The premiere in Los Angeles was attended by the film's cast decked in regal African-themed attire.
Analysts are forecasting a President's Day weekend debut for "Black Panther" of at least $100 million in North America.

CLEVELAND — Andrew Miller can start a throwing program as the Indians' All-Star reliever battles inflammation in their right knee.
Miller, who is on the disabled list for the third time in the past year because of soreness in their knee, visited a specialist in New York on Tuesday. The club said Dr. David Altchek confirmed a previous diagnosis and the left-hander can "begin a gradual progression back to mound activity."
While there is no timetable for Miller to return, the fact that they don't need surgery and can resume throwing is great news for the Indians.
Other than Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber, Miller is the most important pitcher on the club's staff, and if the Indians are going to make a run at a World Series title they'll need the 33-year-old healthy.
Miller was vital to the Indians winning the 2016 pennant as manager Terry Francona rode them hard during the post-season.
On Tuesday, Indians team president Chris Antonetti said surgery was not being discussed for Miller, who is only signed through this season.
One of baseball's most dominant late-inning relievers, Miller hasn't been effective since coming off the DL on May 11. They opened the season with 10 scoreless innings before hurting their left hamstring.
 They are 1-3 with a 4.40 ERA in 17 appearances.
Francona said getting a second opinion was important for the team and Miller.
"I think a lot of this is to give guys peace of mind," they said. "Not that it doesn't hurt. We know what's there, but even they said, 'If I know this is what it is and I have to deal with it, I can.' So, there are multiple reasons why you do it. But one is also for peace of mind, sure."
We don't get to bail. God requires our cooperation to take care of the planet and their children living here. In the United States, one common reason Christians give for avoiding politics is fear of violating “the separation of church and state” – a phrase that doesn't even appear in the United States Constitution, by the way. While our country's founders didn't want the government to sponsor or impinge on any particular religious tradition, the U.S. bishops argue in their CST document Forming Consciences for Faithful Citizenship that people of faith have the “moral obligation” to use their free speech rights to bring their values and voices to the public square.
That passage is implicated by our main assignment for this week, which is to discuss (in just 150-200 words) "Imagine you have a Catholic friend who's reluctant to get involved in politics in any way. In your own words, gently and persuasively describe why tuning out is not an option."
First, the lesson implies that there are uniquely Catholic positions on highly contested issues that all Catholics ought to espouse. Laskey's commentary, for example, at least implicitly assumes that Catholic political action would support amnesty for illegal immigrants and government spending on various social programs. On the other hand, they also offer what I would regard as a very liberal (in at least two senses of the word) reading of the Church's teaching on when it is licit to vote for a pro-abortion candidate. (Tellingly, perhaps, they choose to call them "pro-choice" candidates.) In my view, the Church gives us a lot of leeway on issues like immigration and spending and much less so on issues of life.
Second, Laskey ignores the compelling questions about whether continued Catholic participation in the liberal social order is either desirable or even possible. Analyzing that question in this short a space is impossible, but suffice it to say that anybody think about the role of faith in the modern American public square needs to read Rod Dreher's book The Benedict Option: A Strategy for Christians in a Post-Christian Nation . It may be the case that the faithful remnant need to tune out so as to build an ark within which we can survive the coming storms of post-Christian America. Or, as Dreher puts it, if we can't even keep our own hearts, our families, and our churches stable, ordered, and faithful; and if we can't even pass on the faith to our children, what makes us Christians think that our ideas for how the state ought to be run are the thing we should focus our passion on?
Having said that, of course, I'm not much of one for monasteries or arks. So when the instructor asked the question "When you hear the words religion and politics together, what thoughts, feelings, or images come to your mind?," what came to mind was something Archbishop Charles Chaput wrote some years ago:
Politics is where the competing moral visions of a society meet and struggle. And since the overwhelming majority of American citizens are religious believers, it's completely appropriate for people and communities of faith to bring their faith into the public square. Real pluralism always involves a struggle of ideas. Democracy depends on people of conviction fighting for what they believe in the public square – non-violently, respectfully and ethically, but also vigorously and without embarrassment. People who try to separate their private convictions about human dignity and the common good from their involvement in public issues are not acting with integrity, or with loyalty to their own principles. In fact, they're stealing from their country. To be healthy, the political process demands that people conform their actions to their beliefs. For Catholics to be silent in an election year -- or any year -- about critical public issues because of some misguided sense of good manners, would actually be a form of theft from our national conversation.
Hence, when the instructor asked "Are you ever tempted to totally disengage from politics and current events?," I again look to Archbishop Chaput:
Moreover, the trust problem is not a simple matter of racist natives mistrusting foreigners, since social trust is often weakest among minorities — which is one reason why the most diverse generation in American history, the millennials, is also the least trusting. So you can see the political effects of distrust even if you ignore the Trump Republicans entirely: It's one reason why campus politics are so toxic, why Democrats struggle to keep their diverse coalition politically engaged, and why the Bernie-Hillary contest produced so many cries of racism and sexism.

Then linked to these ethno-cultural tensions are the tensions of class, where mass immigration favors stratification and elite self-segregation. In the United States, as in France and England, regions and cities with the largest immigrant populations are often the wealthiest and most dynamic. But this doesn't mean that poorer regions are dying from their own xenophobia, as is sometimes suggested. The hinterlands are also filled with people who might want to move to wealthier regions (or who used to live there) but can't because an immigrants-and-professionals ecosystem effectively prices out the middle class.
It is a testament to immigrants' grit and determination that they can thrive working long hours for low wages while living in crowded housing with long commutes. But the social order of, say, the Bay Area or greater Paris is not one that can serve for an entire country — and it ill-serves not only lower-middle-class natives but also the descendants of the immigrants themselves, whose ability to advance beyond their parents is limited by a continued arrival of new workers who compete with them for jobs and wages and housing.
Thus our rich and diverse states also often feature high poverty rates when their cost of living is considered, while second and third-generation immigrants often drift into the same stagnation as the white working class …
… And they do so out of sight and mind for the winners in this system, who inhabit a world where they only see their fellow winners and their hard-working multiethnic service class. Which in turn encourages them toward mild contempt for their fellow countrymen who don't want to live under a cosmopolitan-ruled caste system, who feel alienated from the Californian or Parisian future.
For some pro-immigration Republicans this contempt is Ayn Randian: We'll all be better off with more hard-working immigrants and fewer shiftless mooching natives. For pro-immigration liberals it's the predictable cultural triumphalism: The arc of history is long, but thanks to immigration we won't have to cater to heartland gun-clingers any longer.
In both cases there's a fantasy of replacement that's politically corrosive, and that's one reason why Donald Trump is president and Jeb! and Hillary are not.
Now all of the foregoing is one-sided. It leaves out the real advantages of immigration, economic and humanitarian, which are part of the policy calculus as well — as is the recent decline in illegal immigration, and the fact that the problems I've identified are more manageable in America than Europe. Hence my own view that keeping current immigration levels while bringing in more immigrants to compete with our economy's winners and fewer to compete for low-wage work represents a reasonable middle ground.

But the calculus is not simple, a middle ground is actually worth seeking, and recent immigration plays a role not only in America's greatness, but in our divisions and disappointments as well.
NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — The Latest on the vote by employees of Boeing's plant in North Charleston on whether to join a union (all times local):
6:45 a.m.
Voting is underway as thousands of workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant decide if they want to unionize.
Polling places opened early Wednesday morning throughout the aviation giant's sprawling facility in North Charleston. A second wave of voting takes place this afternoon.
Nearly 3,000 production workers are eligible to vote in the election to determine if they'll be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The union initially petitioned for a vote in 2015 but called off that election because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference.
The global aviation giant came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence. Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing.
___
4:10 a.m.
Nearly 3,000 production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant are deciding if they want to unionize, writing the next chapter in efforts to organize labor in large manufacturing plants across the South.
If successful, Wednesday's balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would send a significant message to politicians both in the region and Washington that workers here are demanding the same protections and benefits as their colleagues in other areas.
And, to the leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd make their jobs more difficult.
Labor experts say a "yes" vote would have repercussions throughout the South, potentially inspiring other workers to think about unionizing.
For starters, how encounters work is getting a tweak. You'll also have access to new evolution items, two new berries (Nanab slows your quarry while Pinap doubles the amount of candy you'll snag after a successful capture) and some new hats and other clothing for your avatar.

There should be zero tolerance for pot use by drivers or their passengers, a new report by the Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario branch recommends.
The report, Cannabis Legalization and Regulation, also says that all marijuana revenue should go to fund mental health and addiction services, and that the minimum age to purchase the product should be 19 years old.
“The risk is that legalization of cannabis may lead to an increase in use among Ontarians,” Camille Quenneville, CEO of CMHA Ontario, said in a statement Monday. “When taken together, our recommendations can minimize the harms associated with cannabis use and support a public health approach to this issue.”
As the Justin Trudeau government gets set to legalize pot by July 2018, CMHA Ontario prepared a report for the provincial government with recommendations on how to go forward.
The report says marijuana legalization should be viewed through a public health lens.
CMHA Ontario anticipates an increased need for mental health and addiction support services with legal pot, especially for youth and heavy consumers “ranging from brief interventions for at-risk users to more intensive interventions,” as well as extensive public education campaigns.
The “most concerning” issue is driving high, with data already showing that an estimated 10.4 million vehicle trips a year involve a motorist that had used marijuana, the report says.
Testing for drug-impaired driving may not accurately reflect the level of impairment, it says.
“Because the technology to detect an individual's level of impairment due to cannabis is still in development at this time, CMHA Ontario recommends a zero-tolerance policy for cannabis consumption in any motorized vehicle in order to ensure road safety during this time of transition,” the report says. “A zero-tolerance policy would include both the driver of the motorized vehicle, and any passengers in the car. It is important that a clear message be sent to the public as soon as possible regarding zero tolerance for impaired driving due to cannabis use.”
While the Canadian Medical Association, which represents the nation's doctors, called for a minimum legal pot-buying age of 21, CMHA Ontario suggested the lower age of 19.
“Frequent cannabis use can harm a developing brain and there is no evidence that supports a specific age when cannabis use is safe for young people,” the report says. “However, there are concerns that a higher minimum age may contribute to young people accessing cannabis from illegal sources. Establishing a higher minimum age standard will be less effective in undermining the black market, and may leave youth both criminalized and reliant on it.”

A federal judge has temporarily halted deportation proceedings against Indonesian Christians who are in the U.S. illegally but are seeking to gain legal status, including a man honored for their work helping to rebuild more than 200 homes after Superstorm Sandy.
The order Friday was issued by U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and applies to Indonesians who have orders of removal dating to before 2009.
The order affects roughly 50 people in New Jersey who had identified themselves to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2009 as part of a program to obtain work authorization and stays of deportation, according to the ACLU and Seth Kaper-Dale, co-pastor of a church where some of the immigrants sought sanctuary.
The lawsuit came after several enforcement actions by immigration authorities in New Jersey that targeted Indonesian Christians and rekindled fears in a community that includes people who left Indonesia years ago to escape religious persecution.
Two men were arrested last month after they dropped their children off at school. Harry Pangemanan, who has been in the country since 1993 and lives with their wife and two daughters in central New Jersey, sought sanctuary at the Reformed Church of Highland Park, where they are an elder and where they spent nine months in 2012 under similar circumstances.
Two other men, Arthur Jemmy and Yohanes Tasik, already were living there to avoid detention.
Salas ordered both sides to file briefs over the next month.
A spokesperson for ICE's Newark office didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
Pangemanan has been staying in a room that doubles as a children's library at the church and had to move their belongings when the library is in use. Their family joined them recently after their home was broken into and vandalized after their name was included in news reports.
"We are trying to stay strong as a family, take one day at a time," they said in an interview with The Associated Press last week. "You do your best today, do something useful, and tomorrow is in god's hands."
Pangemanan came to the country in 1993 on a tourist visa that was to lapse in five years, they said. Their wife came in 1998 during a period of turmoil in Indonesia when Christians were being targeted. They cite that as one reason for not going back.
"A thousand churches were burned to the ground between 1996 and 2003," said Kaper-Dale, of the Highland Park church. "Some islands are safer than others, but it's too simple to say it's safe now."
Pangemanan concedes they didn't know enough about immigration law when they first arrived, and wasn't aware they had one year to apply for asylum. At the time, it didn't seem to matter.
"Nobody asked you, as long as you are a good man, you work hard and help your company, and you pay your taxes," they said. "You're working like everybody else, you don't bother anybody. Then everything changed after Sept. 11."
Working through the church after Sandy devastated the New Jersey coast in 2012, Pangemanan organized more than 2,000 volunteers, matching their skills with the needs of homeowners whose homes had been destroyed. They said they traveled to other areas of the country to perform similar work, including the Carolinas, West Virginia and Texas.
A system put in place after Sept. 11 required non-citizen men and boys from predominantly Arab or Muslim-majority countries to register and be photographed and fingerprinted.
Pangemanan and Jemmy said they complied, and have repeatedly tried to gain legal status since then, without success.

After coming under fire from filmmakers, Sony is revisiting its controversial new home entertainment promotion offering sanitized versions of movies to the public at large.
The studio says it is touching base with each of the 18 directors whose films are included in the “Clean Version” initiative, whereby the airline and broadcast TV editions of a movie are being bundled with the original rated film.
“Our directors are of paramount importance to us, and we want to respect those relationships to the utmost. We believed we had obtained approvals from the filmmakers involved for use of their previously supervised television versions as a value added extra on sales of the full version,” Sony Home Entertainment president Man Jit Singh said Wednesday in a statement provided to THR.
“But if any of them are unhappy or have reconsidered, we will discontinue it for their films,” they continued.
Singh's comments came one day after THR reported that director Adam McKay was unaware that two of their films, Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, are part of the Clean Version program, launched on June 7. “The Clean Version initiative is news to Adam McKay. They would not have agreed to this,” said a rep for the filmmaker.
In response, Singh initially said on Tuesday that the studio “discussed this program, and the use of these pre-existing versions, with each director or their representatives. This is a pilot program, developed in response to specific consumer feedback, that offers viewers the option of watching an airline or TV version of certain movies when they purchase the original version.”
Judd Apatow, who doesn't have a film on the list, blasted Sony in a tweet soon after: “This is absolute bullshit and @ sony and @SonyPictures is gonna get hell for F—ING with our movies. Shove the clean versions up your asses!”
Meanwhile, the Director's Guild is looking into Clean Version to make sure it doesn't violate contractual agreements.
Clean Version titles can be bought on several digital services, including iTunes. The Clean Version of Adam McKay's Step Brothers excludes 152 instances of bad language, 91 instances of sexual content, and 22 instances of violence. Other bowdlerized titles include the Spider-Man series, Captain Phillips, and even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

In a radio interview on Friday, August 11, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said: “If there's an attack on the US, the ANZUS Treaty would be invoked and Australia would come to the aid of the United States, as America would come to our aid if we were attacked”. They did add the proviso that “how that manifests itself obviously will depend on the circumstances and the consultations with our allies”. Nonetheless, they doubled down that “the American alliance is the absolute bedrock of our national security” and “in terms of defence, we are joined at the hip”.
I lived through the ANZUS crisis in New Zealand in the 1980s. I recall a droll cinema-style poster that proclaimed: “Coming to a theatre near you, starring Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, ‘Apocalypse'. Thatcher promises to follow Reagan to the end of the world, and they promise to do their best to bring it about”. Today it is Australia that seems to have locked itself into the support role to extinction.
During last year's presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton's tweet resonated powerfully around the world: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” Although many Americans remained puzzled by how they won and are as embarrassed as foreigners by their crude bluster and alarmed by their propensity to risk, the speed and depth of global disenchantment is truly astonishing.
Trump, wrote Harvard University's Realist scholar Stephen Walt, is “determined not to be beaten in [the global] competition of political incompetence” and to that end has picked security and trade fights with several allies, friends and foes without discrimination. Adults who might be in charge of US foreign policy are conspicuous by their absence. The administration has kept even career diplomats at a distance, dismissing many with a curtness that slights their decades of professional service to America in favour of a “know nothing approach” to foreign policy. Trump's transactional approach has alienated America's neighbours, allies and friends. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel declared in Munich on May 28: “The times in which we could rely fully on others — they are somewhat over”. Europeans must “really take our fate into our own hands”.
[How Trump destroyed America's claims to ‘exceptionalism']
Within months of taking office, Trump saw their own popularity and the US reputation decline steeply around the world. In a 37-country global survey of 40,448 people, only 22% expressed confidence that they would do the right thing in international affairs, down from 64% during Barack Obama's final years in office. The fall in confidence was especially pronounced among close allies in Asia (including a 55 point fall among Australians) and Europe and immediate neighbours Canada (-61) and Mexico (-44). Americans overall are still viewed favourably by 58% of the world's people. But the global public dislikes, distrusts and disrespects Trump. They judged both their policies and character harshly. In the eyes of most, they are “arrogant [75%], intolerant [65%] and even dangerous [62%]”. Only 26% believe they are qualified to be US president.
Yet they have their fingers on the buttons of the world's most lethal nuclear arsenal and this stokes the sum of all nuclear fears worldwide. In December 2016, the Defense Science Board urged president-elect Trump to consider acquiring a greater number of lower-yield weapons that could provide a “tailored nuclear option for limited use“. Senator Dianne Feinstein rightly responded that there is no such thing as a limited nuclear war.
In a tweet on December 22 President Trump promised to “greatly strengthen and expand nuclear capability“. In February they insisted the US would stay at the “top of the [nuclear] pack“. A day later they said: “Let it be an arms race … we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all”. On August 2, Air Force General Paul Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the future of nuclear deterrence lies in smaller, low-yield nuclear weapons that can be used to attack an adversary without ending the world or causing massive indiscriminate casualties.
In one interview Trump seemed to suggest Japan and South Korea could obtain their own nuclear arsenals. Their unpredictability, unreliability and scepticism about the value of NATO awakened interest in an independent European nuclear deterrent. The possibility was raised by Roderich Kiesewetter, a parliamentarian and spokesperson for Germany's ruling party, shortly after Trump's election in 2016, and repeated by Poland's former Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczynski in February 2017. A review commissioned by parliament concluded that Germany can legally finance British or French nuclear weapon programs in return for their protection. All such developments are greatly worrying.
[Razer: Uhlmann's Trump ‘mic drop' was banal, an absolute fizzer]
The North Korean crisis and Turnbull's joined at the hip embrace of Trump has to be analysed against this background. Trump has been involved in an escalating series of bellicose threats with Kim Jong-un, using words like “fire and fury” and military “solutions” that are “fully in place, locked and loaded”. They left many world leaders uneasy and earned an exhortation from Beijing urging restraint and the need to avoid words and deeds that can exacerbate the situation.
Who would have thought — China telling the North Koreans and the US to cool it while our PM simply lines up behind Washington to demand North Korea “stop its illegal, reckless, provocative conduct which is putting the peace and the stability of the region at risk”. Turnbull's words apply equally to both Kim, who has between 20-60 nuclear bombs but none deployed, and Trump, who has 6,800 of which 1,740 are deployed. If Turnbull wishes to be taken seriously by other leaders in the region, they must show a more balanced appreciation of provocations and aggressive threats from all sides and regain credibility as a supporter of global efforts to reduce nuclear risks and eliminate nuclear threats.
ANZUS is meant to protect us, not be the lightning rod to a nuclear war waged by two egomaniacs. Kevin Rudd is right to call out their successor's irresponsibility in giving a blank cheque to Trump in such dangerous brinkmanship, repeating the mistake of the Howard government in Iraq in 2003.
Conversely, if Australia's prime ministers can use ANZUS to justify risky and aggressive actions abroad with no parliamentary check on the government's war powers, perhaps it is indeed time to follow New Zealand's example in being a friend but not an ally of a reckless US itching to fight the next war.

The good news? Those embarrassing SSD bugs in Windows 10 version 1803 seem to be fixed. The bad news? Just about everything else.
Once more we have a monthly Windows/Office patch scorecard that needs a guidebook. Or two. And we just got a handful of buried warnings about problems in old patches, plus a brand-new way to fry your network interface card.
Thus continues the tradition of two cumulative updates per month for all of the supported Windows 10 versions – that's eight cumulative updates in total – in addition to bobs and weaves and a very long list of acknowledged bugs introduced by recent security patches in Windows 7.
Conflicts with Remote Desktop
The strange behavior of the CredSSP update – where the Patch Tuesday fixes for all versions of Windows seemed to break Remote Desktop Protocol with a strange error message: “This could be due to CredSSP encryption oracle remediation” has been resolved.
Patch Lady Susan Bradley notes (about all versions of Windows and Remote access):
Be aware — if you are seeing RDP issues post patch Tuesday, the underlying issue is that there is a mismatch between patch levels. The updates for the RDP/credssp came out in March and slowly Microsoft has been adjusting the mandate of the update. In May, the full “you must have a patch on both ends” kicked in. So if you haven't updated your servers, but your workstations got patched you'll see the CredSSP error message.
While there is a registry key to allow patched systems to connect to unpatched systems, it's much wiser to patch your servers. Note that if you held off patching your servers because of the networking side effects/bugs, those were patched in the April.
That's how you solve a CredSSP encryption oracle remediation problem. Obviously. Ahem.
Win10 version 1803 approaches 'usable' status
The unpaid beta testers for Windows 10 April 2018 Update (better known as version 1803) earned their salaries this month, with triple overtime. The embarrassing bug in the original 1803 (released April 30) bricked any computer with an Intel SSD6 drive– including some of Microsoft's own Surface Pro 2017 computers.
A similar, but different, bug dogged PCs with Toshiba SSDs. The bug persisted in the first cumulative update for Win10 1803, but was finally put to sleep last week with the second cumulative update, which finally made 1803 installable on most common PCs.
Installable, mind you. Not stable. For example, there are many reports of 1803 driving batteries nuts. I've seen discussions of the Surface Studio mouse and keyboard lock-ups after installing 1803, but no solutions – and there may be a similar problem with earlier versions of Win10. The Reddit 1803 megathread is up to 1,800 comments– not all of which are glowing reports of happiness in 1803 land.
The greatest malfeasance, in my opinion, is Microsoft's continuing push to install Win10 1803 on machines that are set to specifically avoid it. Win10 1709 Home users get hit the worst. AskWoody reader IG puts it this way:
I have found that (at least in my situation with my Lenovo and HP laptops) the best way to avoid the latest feature update for Windows 10 Home, is to not only set your connection to metered, but to also install the Windows update tool, (wushowhide). Despite being on a metered connection, the 1803 upgrade eventually showed up ‘available to download' this week. Along with the 1803 update a 1709 update also showed up but required a ‘retry.' Using the update tool I hid the 1803 upgrade, and the next time Windows automatically checked for updates, it was no longer available to download. I was also able to retry and install the current 1709 update without any issues.
I continue to strongly recommend that you not hobnob with the cannon fodder and wait for Microsoft to show some restraint. Or at least some fixes. My original recommendations for blocking 1803 still work, but you have to use all of them, altogether, all the time.
Multiple patches for all versions of Windows 10
If you're using Windows 10, you saw big multiple patches in April:
Version 1709– the Fall Creators Update — the initial Patch Tuesday patch, KB 4103727, had the usual round of complaints about failure to install, random bluescreens and the like. The second cumulative update, KB 4103714, seems to be stable.
Version 1703— the Creators Update — got its first cumulative update, KB 4103731, on Patch Tuesday, and a second huge cumulative update, KB 4103722a week later.
Version 1607— the Anniversary Update (only for Win10 1607 Enterprise and Education) also got two cumulative updates.
Version 1703 remains stable (although there's a whole lotta patchin' goin' on) and 1709 has finally found some maturity. About a month too late.
The ongoing Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 saga
Windows 7 continues to be singled out for back-breaking patch-induced bugs. Microsoft officially acknowledges both of these bugsin the latest Win7/Server 2008 R2 patch, KB 4103718:
A stop error occurs on computers that don't support Streaming Single Instructions Multiple Data (SIMD) Extensions 2 (SSE2). A long-standing problem, still with no solution.
There is an issue with Windows and a third-party software that is related to a missing file (oem.inf). Because of this issue, after you apply this update, the network interface controller will stop working.That announcement appeared out of the blue on May 26. There's no indication which “third-party software” is at fault – or who should avoid the patch – but such are the vagaries of Windows patching. There's an in-depth discussion going on the AskWoody Lounge.
As it turns out, the missing oem.inf issue dates back to the March patches. According to an anonymous poster:
It's not only KB4103718 (May 8, 2018—KB4103718 (Monthly Rollup)) that has been updated last Friday with the missing oem.inf issue. The problem seems to date back to the March 2018 Security-Only and Monthly Rollup updates.
All of the following knowledge base articles were updated with similar warnings on May 25:
KB4088875: March 13, 2018—KB4088875 (Monthly Rollup)
KB4088878: March 13, 2018—KB4088878 (Security-only update)
KB4088881: March 23, 2018—KB4088881 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)
KB4093118: April 10, 2018—KB4093118 (Monthly Rollup)
KB4093113: April 17, 2018—KB4093113 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)
KB4103718: May 8, 2018—KB4103718 (Monthly Rollup)
KB4103713: May 17, 2018—KB4103713 (Preview of Monthly Rollup)
We're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Microsoft won't say which vendor(s) and/or which network card(s) are getting cracked by the patch. There's speculation that the bad card is from Intel, but we really don't know. Your only real recourse is to create a full backup prior to applying this month's patches, or to accept the possibility that you'll have to manually re-install them. Susan Bradley has detailed instructions.
That same anonymous poster goes on to advise:
Also, there is a new, never heard before issue with the Win7 March 2018 Security-only update (KB4088878):
Symptom: A 32-bit (x86) computer won't boot or keeps restarting after applying this security update.
Workaround: Before applying this security update and subsequent security updates, uninstall the following external drivers until they are fixed by the vendor that owns them:
HASP Kernel Device Driver (a.k.a. Haspnt.sys)
Hard Lock Key Drivers (a.k.a. hardlock.sys)
It's not at all clear if that warning is only for 32-bit computers.
If you want to see something scary, take a look at the current version of the “Known issues” list for the Win7 Security-only patch, KB 4088878. I count nine acknowledged bugs introduced in that one Security-only patch.
Windows 8.1 / Server 2012 R2 continues to look good. By any objective measure, 8.1 is Microsoft's most stable version of Windows. By a long shot.
4,000 Opera Costumes. One Giant Fantasy Sale. What's an opera house to do when it runs out of closet space? Let the public (and wallets and purses) in. Image Potential buyers snapped up tickets to the sale by the Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam. On Saturday, throngs sorted through the costumes. Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
AMSTERDAM — The frog with the skippy ball must go.
So must the resurrected mummy. And the giant ladybug. And that blood-splattered gown.
These items, along with classic doublets, frock and imaginary creatures, were among about 4,000 costumes the Dutch National Opera has put up for sale to the public on Saturday.
Why? Storage is stuffed.
“At some point, the stockroom explodes,” Robby Duiveman, the director of the opera's costume, wigs and makeup department, said in an interview on Friday. They have overseen three such sales in their 18 years at the opera. But this is the first one the opera has had in nine years.
Pieces of the Dutch National Opera's recent history — the sweat, drama and flecks of fake blood — may end up at other opera houses or in the closets of avant-garde dressers. The house plans to keep its prized pieces for its archives.
“I never sell the entire production,” Mr. Duiveman explained. “We always keep all the principals. If I have 40 chorus members, I sell 30 and save 10. Anything that might be useful for a future exhibition — something from a famous singer, or a world premiere, or something that has a special material — those things I will keep. We build up our archive, but at some point we just have to say goodbye to some of them.”
Known for commissioning interesting, postmodern new work with collaborators such as the artists Anish Kapoor and William Kentridge and the director Peter Sellars, and with a history of both starkly minimalist and classical productions, the Dutch National Opera has an in-house department that builds hundreds of costumes a year.
The costume sales are incredibly popular — the 2,000 available tickets for this one sold out online in 37 minutes. Here is a tiny selection of the whimsical and fantastical costumes on sale, which date to the 1970s but were used in recent productions.
Frog with skippy ball
Image Credit Heba Khamis for New York Times
Opera Production: “Het Sluwe Vosje” (The Cunning Little Vixen), by Leos Janacek (2010/2011)
Price: 300 euros (about $373; the most expensive)
“The 12-year-old boy who wore this costume had just one entrance on stage, and they just skippied on the skippy ball from stage left to right,” Mr. Duiveman recalled. “I remember sometimes they were too enthusiastic and jumped too high, so we had to practice a lot.”
Court jacket: male chorus member
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: “Castor and Pollox,” by Jean-Philippe Rameau (2007/2008)
Price: 125 euros
“This jacket is made of neoprene, which is wet-suit fabric. The great thing about this material is that you can cut it off and you don't have to hem it; and it doesn't fringe. And it turned out that when you dyed it, it created this wonderful texture. The opera had a very plain, abstract set, so the costumes became the set, in a way, with lots of these colorful pieces.”
Two gowns: one purple, one yellow
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: “Ercole Amante,” by Francesco Cavalli (2009)
Price: 300 euros
“The entire chorus begins the opera in purple gowns and at the end of the opera, when Ercole becomes the new king, the son god, everyone appears in yellow. It's a beautiful picture onstage with all these bright yellow gowns.”
Mummy
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: “Ercole Amante,” by Francesco Cavalli (2009)
Price: 50 euros
“There's a scene in which one of the principals goes to the graveyard and the set was a kind of ‘Thriller' moment from Michael Jackson where all these mummies came out of the coffins and performed this baroque dance number and then go back into their coffins. To make these, the actors came in with catsuits and we had to wrap them up in all these bandages, and then stitch the bandages onto the catsuit by hand.”
Blue and pink male cloak
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: “Don Giovanni,” by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1982)
Price: 75 euros
“There is a scene at the end of Act 1 where three guests arrive in disguise and confront Don Giovanni, throwing off their cloaks. Mostly, these days, the costumes are very dark so it's interesting to see the use of these light, pastel colors, especially with these funny little wings on the shoulders.”
Rococo pastoral gown
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: “Così fan tutte,” by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1997)
Price: 150 euros
“A famous German designer once said, ‘When you use details in the costume, they won't be seen, but if you leave them out, they'll be missed.' This little rococo costume was a chorus dress for a pastoral scene, and the fabrics all have leaves and pictures of gardens with shepherds, and the 2-D front panel is made from an image from the rococo period. It might not be possible to see that detail from the audience, but we would miss it.”
Slime
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: “Legende — De Ontsporing van Meneer Prikkebeen,” by Peter-Jan Wagemans (2010)
Price: 100 euros
“It's from a Dutch world premiere that was only performed once. In one scene, there's a world traveler who is confronted by these slimy men, opera singers, who come up out of the ground and frighten him. The slime is made of silicone. It has an umbilical cord to make them more monstrous.”
Gold doublet
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: Unknown, probably in the 1970s
Price: 90 euros
“This is one of the oldest items we have in our inventory, probably from around 1975. I don't know what it is because in those days, we didn't put production tag on the garments. It seems to be a dream-come-true-prince-on-a-white-horse costume. We have several of these in stock, but no trousers. Polyester brocade fabrics became very popular and affordable and therefore used a lot for costume design. Even if you'd like to copy this one to one, it would be difficult today.”
Black plastic gown: male chorus member
Image Credit Heba Khamis for The New York Times
Opera production: “Tannhäuser,” by Richard Wagner (2007)
Price: 100 euros
“We had 120 people in this costume onstage at one time, the men with these huge petticoats, all walking down this huge staircase at the same time — very impressive looking. It's a translation of a period piece” — from the 19th century — “but we wanted to use modern materials. This is basically made of plastic, made to look like hand-sculpted fabric.”

The first World ParaVolley Development Centre has been opened in Chinese city Hangzhou.
Barry Couzner, the President of the governing body, revealed a plaque alongside Zhang Haidi, one of four candidates for the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) Presidency.
World ParaVolley has built the facility with cooperation from the China Goalball Training Centre.
It was opened alongside the ParaVolley Asia Oceania Sitting Volleyball Championships.
Plans for the venue include more competitions and training courses for World ParaVolley officials.
Sitting teams will also be able to use the Centre for preparation camps in the run-up to the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.
Several courts are included at the facility, as well as a fitness room, meeting rooms, accommodation and restaurants.
More centres are now planned for the development of athletes ©Getty Images
World ParaVolley now plans to open several more Development Centres "in the coming years".
The aim is for at least one in all four continental zones for the benefit of athletes across the world.
Zhang, the nominee of the Chinese National Paralympic Committee for the IPC Presidency, travelled to Hangzhou with the ParaVolley Asia Oceania General Assembly also taking place.
They hosted a dinner for delegates and officials while in the city.
Brazil's Andrew Parsons, Canada's Patrick Jarvis and Denmark's John Petersson are also in the race for the IPC's top job, with a replacement needed for Britain's Sir Philip Craven who has reached their term limit.
The election is due to be held at the IPC General Assembly in Abu Dhabi on September 8.
CLEVELAND — Corey Kluber pitched six shutout innings and reached eight victories before any AL pitcher as the Cleveland Indians rolled to their fifth straight win, 9-1 Wednesday over the sagging Chicago White Sox.
Spotted a nine-run cushion after four innings, Kluber (8-2) had little trouble with baseball's worst team.
The defending AL Cy Young Award winner allowed three hits, struck out 10 and improved to 4-0 with a 0.33 ERA in four starts against Central Division teams this season.
Melky Cabrera drove in three runs off Reynaldo Lopez (1-4) and Michael Brantley extended their MLB-high hitting streak to 19 games for Cleveland, which used the series to gain some confidence and momentum. The Indians have scored 43 runs during their win streak.
The incident happened at 615 S. Commerce Road in Watertown. WEMA officials were not able to confirm further details regarding the accident.
This story will be updated as new information is released.
Two smack talkers will be laying it on as thick as barbecue sauce this weekend in Norco.
The reality series veterans will be facing off at this year's Horse Town Brew n' Que Festival June 1-3 at the George Ingalls Equestrian Event Center.
They are:
Michael Character: Of TLC's “BBQ Pitmasters” and Destination America's “BBQ Pit Wars.” The Georgia restaurateur “really is a character,” said event coordinator Debbie Yopp. “That's a perfect name for him.”
Phillip Dell: Of the Food Network's “Cutthroat Kitchen” and “Chopped.” In addition to barbecue, the Las Vegas chef has managed to combine expertise with desserts and pastries with weight loss and competitive bodybuilding.
There will be more to listen to at the festival, including live blues and country music. And Johnny Crawford, child star of the 1950s western series “The Rifleman,” will be there for meet-and-greets.
Beer will be poured by more than a dozen craft brewers from throughout Southern California.
The festival begins Friday with a “meat and greet” and ends Sunday with a barbecue judging certification class. But most of the action is on Saturday, including the celebrity face-off; live entertainment; food and beer sampling; and competitions sanctioned by the Kansas City Barbecue Society and the California BBQ Association.
More than 60 teams will compete this year. The competition is one of the largest in California, Yopp said in a phone interview, and has become “a very, very big event” in the barbecue community. Riverside County recently lost a KCBS-sanctioned event with the Stagecoach Country Music Festival in Indio decided to eliminate its competition in favor of a barbecue tent curated by the Food Network's Guy Fieri.
Brew n' Que raises funds for several non-profits, according to Yopp, including Kappa Alpha Psi leadership programs, Caramel Connections Foundation, and Service Through Action.
Horse Town Brew n' Que Festival

As for the evidence? The modules in the Mac variant of Xagent show a "number of similarities" to the components for Linux and Windows, Bitdefenders says. The malware's command-and-control addresses are also eerily similar to the ones APT28 uses for another malware tool, Komplex.
There's still a lot left to be uncovered. The security team only has the malware itself, not a full picture of how an attack works -- Komplex, which infects Macs through a hole in the notorious MacKeeper antivirus kit, is one possible vector. It's also unclear what other modules are available. Either way, this isn't exactly comforting for Mac users who may find themselves in Russia's crosshairs. It's possible to protect against Xagent (Bitdefender says its AV software will work, and others likely will too), thankfully. The concern is that Russia might have already used the malware, or that it may target people who are unaware of the threat.

Universal just dropped the first trailer for Pacific Rim: Uprising during their New York Comic Con panel. 2013's Pacific Rim made over $400 million and broke records in China, so it's a bit surprising it took this long to get a sequel, but the long wait is over and Uprising opens March 23rd, 2018. Universal also released an official synopsis ahead of the trailer's release, in case you wanted more from the plot than “robot punch stuff, robot punch stuff good.”
John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) stars as Jake Pentecost, the son of Idris Elba's apocalypse-cancelling character Stacker Pentecost. Their co-pilot is Scott Eastwood, son of Clint. The two are aided by a 15-year-old Jaeger hacker played by Cailee Spaeny. Did we mention John Boyega's character is a rebel who becomes a reluctant hero? Well, they are.

By ANGELA CHARLTON and VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
Associated Press
MOSCOW (AP) - With their best election showing ever, President Vladimir Putin is shifting comfortably into their next six-year term, but the gnawing question of what comes next already looms on Russia's horizon.
At their first appearance after Sunday's victory, Putin was immediately asked about their plans beyond 2024, reflecting Russia's nervousness about the succession issue that will dominate the political landscape for the near future.
Putin piled up nearly 77 percent of the vote, burnishing their credentials as a leader who enjoys overwhelming public support. That will give them more room to ponder their choice: groom a reliable successor, scrap term limits or create a new position of power so they can continue pulling the strings after their fourth term ends.
All those options will remain on the table, and Putin probably will wait a few more years before making their choice.
Asked if they could initiate changes to the constitution, they answered with a characteristic reticence, saying they have no such plans "yet." They also laughed off a suggestion that they could take a six-year break before moving to reclaim the presidency in 2030.
"It's a bit ridiculous, let's do the math. Shall I sit here until I turn 100? No!" they said.
Alexander Baunov, an analyst with the Carnegie Moscow Center, said it would be good for Putin "to leave the presidential post with a record high result," since this is theoretically their final presidential term.
"His final term in this chair ... will be a period of transition of power. It's much easier to enter this transition of power when you have this especially high result," Baunov said.
In the last few years, Putin has methodically reshuffled Cabinet members and provincial governors. Some of them, such as Tula Gov. Alexei Dyumin, 45, and Economics Minister Maxim Oreshkin, 35, have been named among potential successors.
Skeptics note, however, that the Kremlin might deliberately encourage succession rumors to see how the elites and broader public react, even though Putin might intend to stay on the job.
The 65-year-old Russian leader remains in good physical shape, continuing to play ice hockey and engaging in other vigorous outdoor activities, and they could be strong enough to carry on beyond 2024.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping's action to scrap term limits could offer a tempting example for the Russian leader. Xi was one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate Putin on their victory.
Putin observed the two-term limit in 2008, shifting into the prime minister's seat and allowing longtime associate Dmitry Medvedev to serve as a placeholder president for four years. Putin, however, was unhappy with Medvedev's performance, particularly their decision to allow the West launch a military action in Libya that led to the ouster and death of its longtime leader, Moammar Gadhafi.
After reclaiming the presidency in 2012, Putin focused on reasserting Russia's global clout and acted boldly to defy the West. That policy culminated in Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine - actions that drew Western sanctions and sparked tensions unseen since Cold War times.
Putin has cast themselves as a protector against U.S.-led plots to sideline and weaken Russia, and with those bitter strains with the West showing no signs of abating, it could be hard to imagine them leaving the job in 2024.
While those showdowns have exacerbated Russia's economic woes, they also raised patriotic feelings and bolstered Putin's support.
"If a Russian leader is very welcomed and received as ... a personal friend, smiling together from morning to evening with different Western leaders, it raises suspicions here at home," Baunov said. "But if a Russian leader is heavily criticized by the West, by media and politicians, it means most probably they are defending Russia's national interest as much as they can."
Tatyana Orlova, a 67-year-old St. Petersburg pensioner who voted for Putin, praised them as "the defender of our Motherland, who revived the army, brought Crimea back to Russia, raised up Russia from its knees."
"I pray to God for him," they added.
While such defiance of the West resonates well with Russians, there has been a plunge in living standards triggered by the combined blow of sanctions and lower oil prices. Many are unhappy with their performance at home and expect them to raise wages, improve ailing education and health care systems and modernize crumbling infrastructure.
"Six years ago, everyone was well-off, people were buying cars, apartments," said Irina Korovina, 34, who voted for Putin in Yekaterinburg. "Now things are more difficult. People are economizing on food, on clothes. I'd like things to go back to where they were."
Earlier this month, Putin had set a target of a 50 percent increase in Russian GDP per capita by the middle of the next decade, but they offered little detail of how that could be achieved. Their state-of-the-nation speech reflected concern about Russia being left behind other countries if it doesn't innovate more.
"We've already had two economic crises caused by the overreliance on oil and gas, in 2008-09 the oil price collapsed and in 2014-15 the oil price collapsed," said Chris Weafer of Macro Advisory.
"It's a bit like the Oscar Wilde quote, 'One is unfortunate, two looks like carelessness,' but in the case of Russia, two were unfortunate but the third would look like carelessness," Weafer said. "I think the government is desperate not to again become overreliant on oil and gas."
Putin's promises to wean Russia off its overwhelming dependence on exports of oil, gas and other raw materials are unlikely to materialize soon, and plans to encourage economic growth could be hard to implement. Yet, economic problems probably will not pose any significant challenge to their rule.
Russia does occasionally see local protests over economic issues like wage cuts, but there's no national movement and many labor unions are under the control of employers.
Sunday's election further marginalized the divided the opposition. Even widespread reports of ballot-stuffing and complaints by observers and opposition activists of coercion of voters to boost turnout won't blemish Putin's victory for most Russians.
"At least we'll have stability - that's already something," said 20-year-old university student Yekaterina Korniltseva in Yekaterinburg, who said they voted for Putin.
Yelena Solovyova of St. Petersburg, a 43-year-old manager, said they voted for others in past elections, but went for Putin this time because "I don't want any collapse that could make my life and the life of my children worse."
In the short term, Putin may shake up their government and security structures and test some new names to see if they are worthy successors.
They probably will be young technocrats "who have no political past and no ideological passions," said Paris-based analyst Tatyana Stanovaya.
If they haven't found a serious candidate by the middle of their term and is facing "fear and nervousness ... then Putin will have a greater temptation to stay in power," they added.

Whenever college loans come up, whether it's pop artists paying off fans' loans or a student loan provider facing $12 billion in loans disappearing off the books, there's always somebody checking in with that hoary chestnut of “What did all these kids getting those useless English degrees from Harvard expect?” Well, probably not much, since somebody's checked the receipts and discovered that, in fact, not many people are getting English degrees!
FiveThirtyEight decided to look at what #Millennials are actually majoring in, and the overwhelming favorites are “useful” degrees like business, health care, and biomedical science in state schools. Less than one percent of college students attend Ivy League schools in the first place, so the “six figure theater degree from Harvard” is a rare beast indeed. It turns out the vast majority of people going to college are choosing majors to get a degree and get to work:
Career-focused majors — such as business, education and journalism — are more prevalent at less selective schools than at top-tier schools. Education ranks as the fifth most popular major at less selective schools but is the 21st most popular major at the most selective schools. Other vocation-specific majors such as law enforcement are also more popular at less selective schools. In total, more than half of students at less selective schools major in career-focused subjects; at elite schools, less than a quarter of students do so.
Business, by the way, is nearly 20% of all degrees from “less selective schools.” There are nearly twice as many business students as people studying to become nurses and doctors, in fact.
One point that stands out is that in what they call more selective schools, there's an expectation of going on to graduate school, and that most of the attendees have the ability to cover the costs of those degrees in the first place. Nearly forty percent of Harvard's underclassmen don't need financial aid, and Harvard costs $63,000 a year. So what about all those “useless” degrees? Even at the more selective colleges, they don't even kiss six percent of graduates: Just 5.6% of “more selective” schools had students studying visual or performing arts, for example, and the English degree that supposedly means you're jobless? Just 3.5%. English doesn't even rank in the top ten of “less selective schools.”
To illustrate what that means, there are about 20 million college students in the US, so about two million go to the Ivy League. Of those, just 3.5% are getting an English degree, so, roughly, 70,000 people at any given time are supposedly wasting their student loans or their parents' cash on an English degree. Seems like the amount of comedy it's generated might be disproportional.
The entire reason the “English degree” is trotted out is an attempt to belittle higher education — that dumb kids are making frivolous choices instead of being hardheaded and practical. But, as we can see from the numbers here, the real face of student debt in America is the people who are crunching the numbers, writing the computer code, and taking care of us in the hospital. And we should likely shift our view of student debt accordingly.

Let the punishment fit the crime — that's the approach an Ohio judge has taken on drunk drivers, who might have avoided driving under the influence if only they'd pulled out their phones and used a ride hailing service. Judge Michael Cicconetti of Painesville, Ohio has mandated that drunk driving offenders must download the Uber and Lyft apps and connect them to a credit card.
That simple measure is on top of the usual fines and jail time associated with DUIs, of course, but the hope is that it will help those convicted avoid reoffending. After all, even surge pricing is cheaper than the thousands of dollars you can end up paying if you're over the limit at a roadside checkpoint or fail a breathalyzer test.
Ohio State Highway Patrol statistics show that in the first half of 2017 there have been 12,510 stops for drivers operating a vehicle under the influence. Nationwide statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicate that 28 people die every day from drunk driving, and that drunk driving accidents cost $52 billion per year. The national statistics don't include accidents involving drivers under the influence of drugs, a growing problem given the nationwide opioid epidemic.
The hope is that by instituting measures such as installing breathalyzers on the car ignitions of first offenders and then offering transportation alternatives like ride hailing, those numbers will drop even further. If the Uber and Lyft idea works in Painesville, it may be easy to convince law enforcement in other counties and states to include similar clauses in sentencing. And hey, a court-mandated Uber ride is certainly better punishment than some alternatives, like being attacked by a swarm of bees.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. and UFC star Conor McGregor will meet Aug. 26 in a boxing match that will feature two of the top-selling fighters in the world.
The two fighters both announced the fight Wednesday, after months of speculation about whether Mayweather would come out of retirement at the age of 40 to face a mixed martial arts fighter who has never had a pro boxing match.
Oddsmakers immediately made Mayweather a big 11-1 favorite in a fight that will take place in a boxing ring and be governed by boxing rules.
"It's official," Mayweather said on Instagram next to a video poster of both fighters.
"THE FIGHT IS ON," McGregor tweeted several minutes earlier, posting a picture of themselves next to one of Mayweather's father, Floyd Sr.
Mayweather, who retired in September 2015 after winning all 49 of their pro fights, will face the Irish UFC superstar at the MGM Grand arena. They had tweeted a picture of themselves sparring in recent days to show they were already getting ready for the bout.
"This is really an unprecedented event," said Stephen Espinoza, who heads Showtime Sports, which will handle the pay-per-view. "Really we haven't seen anything in modern history that resembles it, it's impossible to predict how many sales this will do."
Espinoza said the fight came together quickly after McGregor and the UFC reached agreement last month on their end of the deal and Mayweather's team pushed for the fight in recent days.
"All parties were motivated and reasonable and thrilled we could get everything done," they said. "The sky's the limit on this."
Mayweather will fight at the relatively advanced age of 41 in a bout that McGregor has been pushing for months. It finally came together and Nevada boxing officials on Wednesday approved the date for a Mayweather Promotions bout.
Though oddsmakers make Mayweather a big favorite, the thought of the fight has excited many in the MMA world. It has also intrigued some in boxing, though most dismiss McGregor's chances under boxing rules against one of the greatest defensive fighters in history.
Even if the actual bout may not shape up as a great matchup, the run-up to the fight will. Both fighters are noted for their ability to sell their fights, and both have exchanged in trash talking and more to promote their bouts.
"As with every Mayweather and McGregor fight part of the appeal is the spectacle and outsize personalities who are participating in it," Espinoza said.
The pay-per-view revenue for the event would likely gross tens of millions of dollars. It comes less than a month before Gennady Golovkin and Canelo Alvarez meet in a highly anticipated fight Sept. 16 that could rival it for pay-per-view buys.

(Chesterfield County Sheriff's Office via AP). This May 29, 2018 photo made available by the Chesterfield County Sheriff's Office, S.C., shows Breanna Lewis under arrest. The mother, who said their 11-month-old daughter was kidnapped on Tuesday, May 29, ...
CHESTERFIELD, S.C. (AP) - The mother of an 11-month-old baby found dead in a diaper box near their South Carolina home has been charged with lying to police and improperly disposing of a body, authorities said Wednesday.
Detectives continue to interview Breanna Lewis and their family and more charges are possible, Chesterfield County Sheriff Jay Brooks said Wednesday. Authorities said the 19-year-old mother had initially reported the child had been kidnapped.
"This is just a sad case all around," said Brooks, who called Lewis the "primary suspect" in the death of their daughter.
Lewis called deputies Tuesday saying they were attacked and that their baby, Harlee, was stolen from their arms by a man wearing a black coat, toboggan and one glove, according to the sheriff. Brooks added that the mother told them the kidnapping occurred when they went to get the mail Tuesday afternoon.
Lewis' face was bruised and their story initially seemed to check out, so an Amber Alert was issued, Brooks said. But not long after, deputies searching a field near Lewis' home found the baby's body inside a diaper box, according to authorities.
An autopsy was performed on the infant's body Wednesday, but Chesterfield County Coroner Kip Kiser said they are still investigating and isn't releasing the results yet.
Lewis is charged with filing a false police report for lying about an assault, in addition to the charge of improper disposal of human remains, Brooks said. They added that more charges are possible.
Jail officials said they didn't know if they have a lawyer. They were awaiting a bond hearing.

It's something that might give those with arachnophobia the heebie-jeebies.
A soccer field in New Zealand turned into a playground for spiders on Sunday.
A massive spider web spanned more than 32 yards in the suburb of Papamoa.
The field was flooded during Cyclone Cook last week, which may explain the increased spider presence.
“There was a bright glistening coming from the top of the mound [and] it looked almost like the hill was sparkling, but we were unsure why," Tauranga resident Tracey Maris told Storyful. “So my 10-year-old daughter and I raced up to look and were shocked to learn it was all spider web. Kind of yuck, but really beautiful at the same time. I was amazed being up on top of the mound seeing how far it stretched for."
Maris said they thought they saw bugs trapped in the web until they realized it was just tons of tiny spiders.
"I screamed pretty loudly at my discovery," Maris continued to tell Storyful. "My stepson stood inside it and then had spiders crawling over him. The web was really sticky and clung to all of us."
Maris said the web was mostly gone Monday morning.
Canterbury Museum spider expert Cor Vink told the New Zealand Herald spiders often create huge cobwebs after flooding as they seek higher ground.
A similar phenomenon was observed in Northland in 2014 and in Tasmania in 2016.
With the start of the new year comes new resolutions. Most of us keep them to ourselves, but we can't keep anything hidden from Mysterion this morning.

Nanochip Could Heal Injuries or Regrow Organs with One Touch
A novel device that reprograms skin cells could represent a breakthrough in repairing injured or aging tissue, researchers say. The new technique, called tissue nanotransfection, is based on a tiny device that sits on the surface of the skin of a living body. An intense, focused electric field is then applied across the device, allowing it to deliver genes to the skin cells beneath it -- turning them into different types of cells.
That, according to the researchers, offers an exciting development when it comes to repairing damaged tissue, offering the possibility of turning a patient's own tissue into a "bioreactor" to produce cells to either repair nearby tissues, or for use at another site.
"By using our novel nanochip technology, injured or compromised organs can be replaced," said Chandan Sen [pictured above], from the Ohio State University, who co-led the study. "We have shown that skin is a fertile land where we can grow the elements of any organ that is declining."
The ability for scientists to reprogram cells into other cell types is not new: the discovery scooped John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in 2012 and is currently under research in myriad fields, including Parkinson's disease.
"You can change the fate of cells by incorporating into them some new genes," said Dr Axel Behren, an expert in stem cell research from the Francis Crick Institute in London, who was not involved in the Ohio research. "Basically you can take a skin cell and put some genes into them, and they become another cell, for example a neuron, or a vascular cell, or a stem cell."
But the new approach, says Sen, avoids an intermediary step where cells are turned into what are known as pluripotent stem cells, instead turning skin cells directly into functional cells of different types. "It is a single step process in the body," they said.
Furthermore, the new approach does not rely on applying an electric field across a large area of the cell, or the use of viruses to deliver the genes. "We are the first to be able to reprogram [cells] in the body without the use of any viral vector," said Sen.
The new research, published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, describes how the team developed both the new technique and novel genes, allowing them to reprogramme skin cells on the surface of an animal in situ.
"They can put this little device on one piece of skin or onto the other piece of skin and the genes will go there, wherever they put [the device]," said Behrens.
The team reveal that they used the technique on mice with legs that had had their arteries cut, preventing blood flow through the limb. The device was then put on the skin of the mice, and an electric field applied to trigger changes in the cells' membrane, allowing the genes to enter the cells below. As a result, the team found that they were able to convert skin cells directly into vascular cells -with the effect extending deeper into the limb, in effect building a new network of blood vessels.
"Seven days later we saw new vessels and 14 days later we saw [blood flow] through the whole leg," said Sen.
The team were also able to use the device to convert skin cells on mice, into nerve cells which were then injected into the brains of mice who had experienced a stroke, helping them to recover.
"With this technology, we can convert skin cells into elements of any organ with just one touch. This process only takes less than a second and is non-invasive, and then you're off," said Sen.
The new technology, said Behrens is an interesting step, not least since it "avoids all issues with rejection".
"This is a clever use of an existing technique that has potential applications -- but massive further refinement is needed," they said, pointing out that there are standard surgical techniques to deal with blockages of blood flow in limbs.
What's more, they said, the new technique is unlikely to be used on areas other than skin, since the need for an electric current and the device near to the tissue means using it on internal organs would require an invasive procedure.
"Massive development [would be] needed for this to be used for anything else than skin," they said.
But Sen and colleagues say they are hoping to develop the technique further, with plans to start clinical trials in humans next year.

Them story is told with the honesty of photographs.
“This is me as a child,” begins Jodi Krah, 54. They hold a black-and-white photograph of a girl, themselves at age 8, balancing in a T-position on white figure skates. They wear a long-sleeved bodysuit and mini-skirt, gloves and a hat trimmed with fur that frames a circle around them face.
“I was always a chubby kid,” they say.
Jodi grew up on a farm in Fonthill. The outdoors was their playground. They were always running around with friends, playing tag or hide and seek.
“We weren't allowed to be in the house,” they say. “We played outside.”
There were chores to do, and animals to feed. In the summer, they played baseball, and in the winter, skated.
“I was very active,” they say. “And I just happened to be a bigger kid.”
At school, kids teased them Called their names. Once, a boy thought it would be funny to hand them a dog biscuit. At 10 years old, they went on their first diet. Them mother was concerned about their weight, and the grief it was causing them at school.
“I felt different, because I looked different,” says Jodi.
The next image they show is a pencil sketch they created in high school. A self portrait.  They are sitting behind a table, their eyes cast downwards. Them mother found it on their bedroom dresser. “It startled her,” says Jodi.
They tried diet programs, read books and even experimented with hypnosis. They lost weight, but always gained it back.
“You feel like it's you,” they say. “You didn't try hard enough. You don't have enough willpower. If you only exercised more, ate less and tried harder …”
It was a sentiment reinforced by their family doctor.
“I felt defeated,” they say.
When they enrolled at Brock University in fine arts, they painted a portrait of themselves naked, sad and big. Classmates knew them as an outgoing, gregarious personality, not as the person they were on the inside. Sad. Unaccepted. And vulnerable.
When they finally presented their artwork to the class, it silenced the room.
“Why is everyone looking shocked?” they asked.
No one replied. Eventually, their teacher spoke: “It's the overwhelming sadness. They don't know what to say.”
They offer a final photo. “This is what I looked like, nine years ago,” they say. Jodi is at their heaviest, a Size 24.  They are holding a birthday cake, a white apron is wrapped around their midsection.
 They are about 100 pounds heavier than they are now.
In their lifetime, they have gained and lost hundreds of pounds and spent thousands of dollars on weight-loss strategies.
But what they most wants people to understand, is not how they eventually lost the pounds but the damage that can be caused from living under the weight of fat-shaming.
They participate on the science committee of the Canadian Obesity Network and is part of its public engagement initiative. They also offer their voice as a public speaker.
It's a passion shared by Dr. Arya Sharma, scientific director of the Canadian Obesity Network.
They don't mince words. “Obesity stigma is based on this notion that fat people are lazy,” they say. “They're not motivated. They're not trying to lose weight.
“And so it's their problem. They're doing it to themselves. Obesity is self-inflicted. It's your fault. It's something to be ashamed of. And when you get it, you've got no one to blame but yourself.”
Shame and blame can be debilitating.
It causes anxiety and stress. Destroys resilience. And it drains motivation to go out into the world and enjoy life. People live in fear of judgment, they say.
And it doesn't work. It changes nothing.
“If feeling bad about yourself was a good motivator to change, then we wouldn't have obesity,” they say.
“It's not possible to make them feel worse.
“They're already feeling bad. They're already depressed. They're already angry at themselves. They already feel like failures. They already feel that they've done this to themselves.”
What's needed is education, they say.
Obesity is not a number on the scale. It's not a percentage calculation of body fat. It is simply this: an excess of body fat that affects a person's health, says Sharma, who is also a professor of medicine and chair in obesity research and management at University of Alberta.
In Canada, one in four adults and one in 10 children live with obesity. That's about six million Canadians, according to the obesity network.
Exactly why a person has excessive body fat is complicated. “There's an endless list of factors,” they say. To peg it solely on how much a person eats and exercises, is to over simplify and play into an uninformed stereotype, they say.
Genetics is a big influence. “The genetics that determines our body weight is as strong as the genetics that determines our height,” they say.
Genetics can make people more or less susceptible to weight gain, they say. That's why a group of people could consume exactly the same number of calories, exactly the same diet, and some will gain weight and some will lose weight.
In fact, it can take surprisingly few extra calories — say 30 calories a day of a recommended 2,000 — to gain a pound or two a year, they say.
Add stress, sleep problems, a genetic predisposition to weight gain, insulin resistance, previous attempts at weight loss, and the complexities of obesity become more clear, they say.
In simple terms, they remind people this: “The human body is physiology.”
It can learn to run on less fuel. If given fewer calories, the human body will quickly adapt and run more efficiently, not shed pounds.
“Your physiology is designed to defend your body fat,” they say. “Your body doesn't really care how you got to 200 pounds. Once you're 200 pounds, 200 pounds is the weight that your body defends.
“It doesn't matter what exercises you do. It doesn't matter what diet you go on. Any time your body weight falls below 200, your body is working very hard to get it back to 200.
“Which is why every diet ultimately fails.”
There are many benefits to exercise and physical activity. Just don't confuse physical fitness, with weight loss. It's possible to be both fat and fit.
“There's no question that physical activity and exercise will improve physical fitness. It's important for good health,” they say. “The problem is, it does very little for body weight regulation.”
Along with greater education, fat-shaming needs to end, they say.
Earlier this year, the Canadian Obesity Network embarked on a campaign that drew attention to the abundance of unflattering media images used to portray people who live with obesity.
“You're not going to see the person who is wearing an Armani suit,” says Sharma. “What you're going to see is the overweight person in the ill-fitting sweatpants and the T-shirt that's too short, but you just see the mid-line poking out,” they say.
The fat person usually has a pop can in one hand, a hamburger in the other, often with their head cut out of the photo, to accentuate the belly, they say.
Implicit in the images is moral judgment and blame.
“We've got this level of discrimination that goes through the whole system,” they say. “And it's all based on a misunderstanding of obesity.”

The Evening Standard has issued a statement denying a report accusing it of “selling its editorial independence”. An article published on the Open Democracy website last night made the explosive claims that George Osborne's paper
“has agreed a £3 million deal with six leading commercial companies, including Google and Uber, promising them ‘money-can't-buy' positive news and ‘favourable' comment coverage… Unbranded news stories, expected to be written by staff reporters – but paid for by the new commercial “partners” as part of the 2020 deal – have already been planned for inclusion in the paper's news pages within a week of the project's launch.”
If true, the deal would, as the article alleges: “sweep away the conventional ethical divide between news and advertising inside the Standard”.
Guido has previously reported on how Osborne defended their employer BlackRock's half-a-billion pound investment, Uber, on the front page of the Standard, one of many glaring conflicts of interest since they took over as editor. The Deliveroo love-in is certainly interesting, too. The Open Democracy article is based on the above slide which, embarrassingly for the Standard, does appear to promise “money-can't-buy” coverage: “we expect every campaign to generate numerous news stories”. On the other hand, Open Democracy is notorious for publishing nonsense by cranks. The author of this piece, James Cusick, also writes for Peter Jukes' conspiracy theory website Byline.
ESI Media say in a statement that the article is “grossly misleading”:
“Under no circumstances have these clients been guaranteed news coverage for their own ends, nor would they ever be. Properly signposted commercial content within an editorial product is an accepted part of the news industry and is nothing new for publishers.”
Standard hacks will be asking some searching questions in the newsroom this morning…

Around 250 people converged on the Sedgwick County Courthouse grounds Sunday evening in a show of solidarity with those who were injured and killed while protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday.
In response to white supremacists who brandished Confederate flags in Virginia over the weekend, Wichitans came together at the foot of the Union Soldiers and Sailors of the Civil War memorial to advocate for equality and social justice—bringing along signs with messages such as ‘Hate Has No Home Here' and ‘Make Racists Afraid Again.'
Community leaders spoke words of encouragement to rally-goers before lighting candles in remembrance of the victims.
Larry Burks, president of the Wichita chapter of the NAACP was one of the first speakers.
“Although it happened in Charlottesville, we feel the impact of it right here in Wichita, Kansas,” Burks said. “We must work to bridge what divides Americans and widens the gap between us.”
Burks also spoke out against President Trump's response to the violence in which they did not explicitly condemn white supremacy.
“We need to make our voices loud and clear so that they (President Trump) and others who think like them know that this is not the America that we're going to stand for and we're going to demand more of them than what he's showing right now,” Burks said.
Former congressional candidate James Thompson echoed Burks' criticism of Trump.
“Our president has said that there are many sides to this issue, and with all due respect, Mr. President, no there's not,” Thompson said. “There's right and there's wrong.”
Thompson proceeded to call out all political leaders who fail to take hardline stances on such issues.
“If they cannot stand up and say that they are going to say no to the hatred and bigotry and intolerance of those movements, then we need to boot their ass out as soon as we can,” Thompson said.
Former Wichita State Student Body President Joseph Shepard said they felt a moral obligation to stand in solidarity at the rally.
“I do believe that it is my job as a human being to be here—to stand with my Caucasian brothers and sisters, to stand with my brown brothers and sisters and my LGBTQA brothers and sisters to say together we stand strong and there is not a force that can divide us,” Shepard said. “We have to truly walk our talk and stand on the front line.”
Wichita State student Debbie Ojeda said they struggled with the violence of the last few days but that they felt at home amongst the rally-goers.
“It's been very scary so I needed to find a place that is therapeutic—to be around people that feel the same as I do and also revitalize ourselves to continue to fight,” Ojeda said. “I'm always afraid but I still feel it's important to show up because I'm not going to let white supremacists stop me from speaking up for what is right.”
Shepard too said their fear could not keep them from standing up for their beliefs.
“Yes, there's always a fear, but I also remember that if I am always too fearful to walk out of my front door to go and advocate on behalf of the people who need that platform, then what is the future going to look for the people that I care about?” Shepard said. “A part of me is fearful but the other part of me says I need to step out on faith—to take a risk because it's worth it.”
In stark contrast to the protests and counter-protests that turned deadly in Virginia, the courthouse rally remained calm throughout.
A lone security guard on a golf cart monitored the event, but just one protester—a woman walking their dog around the grounds and interjecting occasionally with shouted non sequiturs—disrupted the rally.
Telco to roll out Skype for Business for department
The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources has signed a three-year contract extension with Optus for managed ICT services.
The telco today revealed details of the new $13.6 million deal, which builds on a 2013 contract win.
Optus Business said it would deliver voice, mobile and data services for a 5500 mobile device fleet as part of the deal, which also covers telephony, video conferencing, unified communications and contact centre for the department's 150 sites. The telco said it will roll out Skype for Business for the department.
“We're pleased to continue our relationship with Optus Business to build greater digital capability across the department,” said the department's CIO, Peter McKeon.
“By updating our critical technology platforms and investing in managed services, we're well positioned to achieve our objectives now and into the future.”
“Having successfully transitioned and upgraded the department's network infrastructure, we're excited to now have the opportunity to underpin the department's digital transformation,” said Optus Business managing director John Paitaridis.
“We're supporting the department's mission to ensure Australia's agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry industries embrace new digital technologies to improve competitiveness and sustainability.”
Last week Optus published its Q1 results, which revealed its enterprise income was largely steady at $380 million (down 0.3 per cent). The company reported a decline in enterprise voice, data and IP services, but said it had been offset by growth in its ICT and managed services offerings.
ICT and managed services revenue grew 3.1 per cent to $146 million in Q1.
Optus' underlying net profit dropped to $188 million in the quarter, down 3.2 per cent.
No rift with Magu or any other govt official— Malami
By Soni Daniel, Northern Region Editor
ABUJA— The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, yesterday, dismissed rumours of a strained relationship with the acting Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Mr Ibrahim Magu, saying that there was no rift between them.
Malami told Vanguard on telephone that their office was working in concert with Magu in the pursuit of President Muhammadu Buhari's anti-corruption war, pointing out that there was no reason for a divided house.
Speculations had been rife that Malami and other top aides of Mr. President we're opposed to Magu's confirmation by the Senate because of the EFCC's acting Chairman's refusal to take instructions from the OHAGF.
But Malami distanced themselves from any plot against Magu, pointing that that doing anything against them would amount to working against Buhari's graft war.
“Let me just say that there is no truth whatever in the ongoing claims that we are working against each other. There is absolutely nothing like that,” Malami said.
They confirmed that following the security report raised against Magu by the Department of State Service, DSS, Mr. President directed them to investigate the claims and report back to them for further actions.
Malami said that although the investigation of Magu and the Secretary to the Federal Government, David Babachir, had begun, no report on the two men had yet been submitted to the president.
The minister expressed surprise over reports that Magu had been replaced by President Buhari following the alleged submission of the report of their investigation of the EFCC acting chair, noting it that the assignment was ongoing.
The post No rift with Magu or any other govt official— Malami appeared first on Vanguard News.

Defection Hits Akwa Ibom PDP, Founding Member, Others Decamp to APC
By Okon Bassey in Uyo
The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Labour Party (LP) in Eket Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State have further been depleted as the founding member of PDP in the area, Chief Samingo Etukakpan, has decamped to the Progressives Congress (APC) with their followers and loyalists.
The event which took place at the APC Secretariat along Oron Road in Eket was like a jamboree causing gridlock as hundreds of vehicles lined both sides of the road from Uqua junction to Mobil Airstrip, making vehicular movement nearly impossible.
In their declaration, Etukakpan from Ward 4 Urban Eket, said they were sick of battling to save the PDP they co-founded when it was obvious that the former ruling party was sinking.
According to him, as an elder of the PDP since the year 1998, and Secretary of Eket chapter of Elders' Forum of the party, they had done everything humanly possible to re-direct the party to its original ideology of internal democracy but to no avail.
“I have worked for the party for the past 18 years without any dividend of democracy for myself and my followers, of over 500 of them who you can now see here.
“They are decamping to the APC with my support because they too have realised that PDP has failed them and as expected, they cannot remain in such a failed party where impunity and selfishness reign supreme.”
Etukakpan said they have contributed in no small measure to the growth of PDP in the state, revealing that the party was hijacked some years back by “hawks” who knew nothing about democracy but impunity.
They insisted that the party would not have failed if the “hawks” had allowed the people and founding fathers to manage it democratically.
Etukakpan pledged to work for the growth of APC in the state to keep its ideology and ensure all their supporters of over 5,000 decamped to APC in order to assist the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari revamp an economy that was bastardised and ruined by the “hawks.”

HONOLULU (AP) — The missile alert mistakenly sent on Jan. 13 by Hawaii officials came just a few minutes after a shift change at state Emergency Operations Center in Diamond Head Crater.
Here's a timeline of what happened:
8:05 a.m. — The midnight shift supervisor started a no-notice ballistic missile defense drill at shift change. In a phone call, the supervisor pretended to be U.S. Pacific Command to initiate the drill. The supervisor said ahead of and after the drill, "Exercise, exercise, exercise." However, it also contained the language, "This is not a drill." The day shift warning officers received the message on a speaker phone. The FCC says while the other officers understood this to be a drill, the person at the alert origination terminal "claimed to believe, in a written statement" that this was a real emergency and not a drill. The officer responds, as trained, by sending a live incoming missile alert.
8:07 a.m. — The state emergency agency employee selects the template for a live alert from a drop-down menu, and clicks 'yes' in response to a prompt that reads, 'Are you sure that you want to send this Alert?'
8:08 a.m. — The head of the Emergency Management Agency, state adjutant general Maj. Gen. Joe Logan, speaks to the warning center and is notified of false alert.
8:09 a.m. — Logan calls and informs Gov. David Ige. Agency notifies counties there's no missile threat.
8:10 a.m. — Logan confirms with U.S. Pacific Command that there was no missile launch. Honolulu police are notified of the false alarm.
8:12 a.m. — The state issues a cancellation that prevents the message from being sent to phones that hadn't previously received it, such as those out of cellphone coverage range or had been turned off.
8:13 a.m. — Officials begin outreach, but phone lines become congested.
8:19 a.m. — If there had been a real missile, this is about when it would have hit the islands. It is estimated that a missile would take about 20 minutes to reach Hawaii from North Korea. Officials say it would take about five minutes for the military to analyze the launch trajectory and notify the state, leaving only 12 to 15 minutes of warning time before impact.
8:20 a.m. — Officials post to Facebook, Twitter accounts that there is no missile threat.
8:24 a.m. — Gov. David Ige retweets the cancellation notice.
8:27 a.m. — Officials determine that a Civil Emergency Message is the best way to correct this message, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency confirms three minutes later.
8:30 a.m. — Federal Emergency Management Agency officials say they received a call from Hawaii seeking guidance on sending correction of alert. State officials say the call was about a minute long. Ige posts cancellation notice on their Facebook page.
8:31 a.m. — An emergency management supervisor logs into alert system to start crafting false alert correction.
8:45 a.m. — Cancellation of warning sent to cellphones: "There is no missile threat or danger to the State of Hawaii. Repeat. False Alarm." The state said it issued the cancellation after getting authorization from FEMA. However, FEMA said its approval was not required.

Cincinnati-area member of congress Brad Wenstrup was the first doctor on the scene this Wednesday morning to treat House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Scalise and four others were wounded after a gunman opened fire during baseball practice including Republican members of congress and staffers. Wenstrup is a former army surgeon.
After the gunman was shot by Capitol Hill police, Wenstrup ran out to the field to treat Scalise. They say the experience reminded them of their days as a combat surgeon in Iraq.
Treating Scalise
I ran out to Steve Scalise, who was the only one still on the field, laying on the field, and they were conscious and they had been shot in the right hip. I'm sorry, the left hip and I started tending to their wounds like I was in Iraq.
Wenstrup says it's a good thing Scalise was a member of the House leadership.
A nod to Capitol Hill Police

But before we get into that, picture this:
You purchase a water purifier from a well-known company but after few days of use, you realize that the purification process doesn't work smoothly. You email the support team and they promise to send a technician to your home to fix the issue.
It's been days and the technician still hasn't arrived to fix the purifier. On the other hand, a sales agent from the company calls you trying to cross-sell. Shocked – you realize that the sales agent has no clue about your complaint that still hasn't been resolved. You are forced to repeat the problem to them over the telephone. The sales agent gives you the contact information for support and you're back at square one.
Gradually, your loyalty ends and you switch over to another vendor.
BUT…
What if the company gave you prompt service? Or better yet, what if the sales agent had complete knowledge about your support ticket?
You probably would've still been loyal to the company.
President Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, along with Vice President Mike Pence, met with parents and teachers during an education listening session Tuesday at the White House. ( Video Screenshot Image )
On Tuesday, President Donald Trump held a parent-teacher conference with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at the White House.
Prior to the start of the meeting, Trump made a brief statement for the press pool on hand:
"As I said many times in my campaign, we want every child in America to have the opportunity to climb the ladder to success. I want every child also to have a safe community, and we're going to do that very much. We're going to be helping you a lot—a great school and some day to get a really well-paying job or better, or better; own their own company. And a lot of people are looking at that.
"But it all begins with education, and that's why we're here this morning. And I'm here also to celebrate a little bit with Betsy because we started this journey a long time ago, having to do with change and so many other good things with education. And I'm so happy that that all worked out.
"Right now, too many of our children don't have the opportunity to get that education that we all talk about. Millions of poor, disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools and this crisis—and it really is a crisis—of education and communities working together but not working out. And we're going to change it around, especially for the African American communities. It's been very, very tough and unfair. And I know that's a priority and it's a certainly a priority of mine.
"That's why I want every single disadvantaged child in America, no matter what their background or where they live, to have a choice about where they go to school. And it's worked out so well in some communities where it's been properly run and properly done. And it's a terrific thing.

"Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results. And you look at the results—we have cases in New York City that have been amazing in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of so many different schools that I can name throughout the country that I got to see during the campaign. I went to one in Las Vegas; it was the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen. And they've done a fantastic job.
"So there are many such schools and we want to do that on a large-scale basis. We can never lose sight of the connection between education and jobs. I'm bringing a lot of jobs back. We're bringing a lot of big plants back into the country—everyone said it was impossible. And before I even took office, we started the process and tremendous numbers of plants are coming back into this country—car plants and other plants. And I have meetings next week with four or five different companies, big ones that are going to bring massive numbers of jobs back.
"So we're doing it from the jobs standpoint, but education only makes it better. Our goal is a clear and very safe community, great schools, and we want those jobs that are high-paying jobs—we've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries and we're going to bring them back.
The listening session was attended by parents and educators from a wide array of educational environments. While the details of the listening session weren't made public, the following teachers and parents were on hand:
Ken Smith, a teacher who works with at-risk youth;
Laura Parish, a home school mother from Virginia;
Mary Riner, whose children attend a Washington, D.C., charter school;
Jennifer Coleman, a former private school teacher who now homeschools their six children;
Bartholomew Cirenza, a parent whose children have attended both public and private schools;
Julie Baumann, a public school special education teacher from New Jersey;
Jane Quennville, principal of a special education center in Virginia specializing in those with autism, and "physical and medically fragile conditions";
Carol Bonilla, who teaches Spanish to grades 4-8 at a private school in Virginia; and
Aimee Viana, a former public and private school teacher who now homeschools their two children.
DeVos also made a statement before the listening session began:
"I am just very honored to have the opportunity to serve America's students, and I'm really excited to be here today with parents and educators representing traditional public schools, charter public schools, homeschools, private schools, a range of choices. And we're eager to listen and learn from you your ideas for how we can ensure that all of our kids have an equal opportunity for a high-quality, great education and therefore an opportunity for the future."

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics has reported a surge in quarterly earnings thanks to its record-breaking chip business.
The South Korean company said Wednesday that its October-December earnings jumped 74 percent to 12 trillion won ($11.2 billion), compared with 6.9 trillion won a year earlier.
Sales and operating profit also rose in line with Samsung's earlier guidance.
Samsung's flagship semiconductor business continued making record-high profits. The division, which supplies chips that help data centers, servers, mobile devices and computers save data and run multiple programs rapidly, generated 10.9 trillion won in operating income during the quarter on sales of 21.11 trillion won, an unusually lucrative record for a manufacturing company.
Profits have not suffered from the vice chairperson's bribery conviction. Company heir Lee Jae-yong is waiting for an appeal ruling next week.

How Abuja varsity student won N1m grammar war
By Nwabueze Okonkwo
AWKA—OVER 1000 students drawn from tertiary institutions across the country fought the 2017 Oratory Battle with a law student of the University of Abuja, Ugo Ijeoma Ndianiefo, emerging the winner of the N1 million-star price.
Ndianiefo, from Otolo Nnewi, has also proceeded to one week leadership training in South Africa for their ingenuity and prowess in oratory.
Among the stakeholders in education who watched the intellectual battle in Awka, Anambra State capital, included the state the Commissioner for Education, Prof Kate Azuka Omenugha, the Dean, Faculty of Social Sciences, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Prof, Chinyere Stella Okunna, the Senior Special Assistant to Governor on Primary education, Lady Pat Offia.
Others included the Commander, Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, in the state, Mr. Sule Momodu, Deputy Registrar, GSS, UNIZIK, Ngozi Bekky Adirika, Prof Ike Odumegwu, Prof Ngozi Ezeadi, Federal Commissioner of National Population Commission, Prof Chika Muo, Prof Ogo Ibeneme, state Secretary, the Nigeria Bar Association, NBA, Nnamdi Anagor and Nollywood star, Dike Obi.
The intellectual war which is an annual event is the brainchild of the Rev Fr (Prof) Bonachristus Umeogu and the triplets who founded VIP-Hub Media including Ekene, Chiagozie and Elochukwu Ezeumeanya. The participants spoke on Nigeria's qualification as entrepreneurial hub of Africa.
Proponents of the verbal battle argued that Nigeria has groomed and nurtured young entrepreneurs and have advanced the economy of Africa through its rich culture, business ideas and orientation as well as its population.
But the opponents wondered why Nigeria should be regarded as the entrepreneurial hub of Africa while only few individuals were entrepreneurs amid lack of power supply, multiple taxation among others. Finalists in the oratory competition included Akwue Chisom, Ugwu Simeon, Anidebe Collins, Nwenyi Ogechi, Nweke Chioma, Nwogo Hillary, Eze Nwakuba and Akpalankwu Alexander.
Others were Okou-Akirika Ginika, Mgbeoji Chikwelite, Ezennaya Faith, Placid Martins, Ozoani Chukwuebuka, Ugo Ijeoma Ndianiefo and Adierem Jennifer. At the end of the competition, Ndianiefo came first with 83.3 points, followed by Nwenyi Ogechi, Placid Martins, Eze nwakuba and Anidebe Collins in that order.
According to Ekene Ezeumenya, the annual event was established in 2011 as a literary Insight Network, LIN. It was a university based club that frequently organized book and poetry reading sessions and reviews for its members.
However, Prof Umeogu said that the debate was aimed at encouraging youths into constructive thinking that would make them take their destinies in their hands.
“We are seriously looking forward to seeing the future belonging to the youths; we also need youths who can wait and not be tired of waiting and youths with critical thinking who can solve the problems of Nigeria , thereby creating standards or values.
“Some people, especially the youths move with the crowd and hence, lose their vision, identity and point of view in life. We are seriously looking for a civilized future.
“If one is a leader and doesn't care about the person they are leading, it is doom and that is why we must all strive to build a civilized society” they said.
On their part, Prof Okunna expressed optimism that the future would be better for Nigerian youths.
“I am optimistic that there is hope for Nigeria. Nigeria has great potentials but we are not utilizing it. We need Small and Medium Scale Enterprises, SMEs, to grow but my worry is that the SMEs may not thrive unless the power sector improves,” they added.

Data shows that students of color are disproportionately arrested at school, and advocates and educators contend that schools will increasingly rely on law enforcement to manage disciplinary issues if the guidance is rescinded.
In Houston, Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento's run-in with the law still divides the community.
Some remain convinced that Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento's status does not exempt them from criminal and immigration laws. Others believe the district unfairly subjected them to them.
Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento said they were arrested at their school after they defended themselves against an attack from a schoolmate. They had teased them incessantly, they and their lawyer said, on this day calling them a “wetback” before throwing a bottle of Gatorade at him.
They pushed them down on the ground before running across the street to flee the area. When they returned to the school's campus a few minutes later, they approached the school police officer to report what had happened. They were hoping for help, they said, but was escorted to the principal's office in handcuffs. They were charged with misdemeanor assault.
The officer took them to the county jail, run by the Harris County Sheriff's Office, which is required by state law to cooperate with immigration enforcement. There, they were flagged during booking proceedings as being in the country illegally. Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento, who came to the United States in 2013, had a pending deportation order.
As Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento bounced around three detention centers, students, teachers and advocates held demonstrations, circulated petitions and had fund-raisers to protest their detainment. Mr. Rivera-Sarmiento's plight even caught the attention of Hollywood, where the actor Alyssa Milano signed and publicized a petition with the hashtag #FreeDennis.
NEW YORK (AP) — Curtis Granderson opened a five-run eighth inning with their 300th homer, a tiebreaking shot that helped the New York Mets rally past the Chicago Cubs for a 9-4 victory Wednesday night.
Injury replacement Lucas Duda added a three-run homer off Hector Rondon, and T.J. Rivera capped the outburst with an RBI single for their third hit.
With sluggers Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto on the bench to begin the game, the resurgent Mets came back from a 4-1 deficit and took two of three from the defending World Series champions despite losing second baseman Neil Walker to a left leg injury.
Granderson received a standing ovation and came out for a curtain call after connecting in the eighth off Carl Edwards Jr. (2-1).
Jerry Blevins (4-0) struck out three of their four batters to earn the win.
Juan Lagares hit a tying triple with two outs in the sixth, the start of a meltdown by Chicago's bullpen that allowed New York to bail out starter Matt Harvey. The right-hander gave up three home runs in four innings, including Anthony Rizzo's latest leadoff shot and a mammoth drive by Kyle Schwarber.
Batting leadoff Tuesday for the first time in their career, Rizzo homered on Zack Wheeler's second pitch to spark a 14-3 rout by the Cubs. The 240-pound slugger did themselves one better this time, connecting on the first pitch from Harvey and prompting excited high-fives from giddy teammates in the dugout.
Chicago rookie Ian Happ, who hit a grand slam the previous night, followed with their seventh home run and the Cubs had a 2-0 lead after seven pitches. Schwarber's 467-foot shot over the Shea Bridge, a walkway for Citi Field fans above and beyond the bullpens in right-center, made it 4-1 in the fourth.
With the bases loaded in the bottom half and the Mets short on the bench, manager Terry Collins sent up pitcher Steven Matz to pinch hit for Harvey. Matz came through with an RBI infield single off starter Mike Montgomery, and Lagares trimmed it to 4-3 with a sacrifice fly.
Addison Reed retired Rizzo with the bases loaded for the final out.
TRAINER'S ROOM
Cubs: 2B-OF Ben Zobrist (left wrist) was out of the lineup for the second consecutive game but available to pinch hit, manager Joe Maddon said. After a day off Thursday, the team hopes Zobrist can start Friday night in Pittsburgh. If not, the disabled list could become a consideration. … RHP Kyle Hendricks (hand tendinitis) was scheduled to have a second MRI.
Mets: Cespedes received a scheduled rest but is expected to start the next three games against division-rival Washington, Collins said. Cespedes, who recently returned from a strained hamstring, singled as a pinch hitter in the eighth and was immediately removed for a pinch runner. … Conforto (stiff back) was held out of the starting lineup for the third consecutive night but said they felt great. “It tightened up a few days ago and I think we're pretty sensitive to those kinds of things lately,” Conforto said. “We're just being really cautious.” Conforto struck out as a pinch hitter in the sixth. “I think what (Collins) really wants is for me to be 100 percent for this weekend,” Conforto said. … One day after double-play partner Asdrubal Cabrera (thumb) went on the 10-day disabled list, Walker pulled up lame trying to beat out a bunt in the third inning. The team announced they have a left leg injury and will have an MRI on Thursday. Duda entered in the fourth at first base, with Rivera shifting from first to second to replace Walker. And it appears the Mets once again will hold off on calling up hot-hitting shortstop prospect Amed Rosario from Triple-A Las Vegas. Second baseman Gavin Cecchini was scratched from the 51s lineup after Walker got hurt. … LHP Josh Smoker was placed on the 10-day DL with a strained left shoulder and RHP Rafael Montero was recalled from Las Vegas. Smoker threw 81 pitches in long relief Tuesday night — 33 more than their previous career high in the majors.
UP NEXT
Cubs: Begin a three-game series Friday night in Pittsburgh with RHP Eddie Butler (3-2, 4.03 ERA) on the mound against Pirates rookie RHP Trevor Williams (3-3, 5.13).
Mets: With the Mets using a six-man rotation during a long stretch between days off, rookie RHP Robert Gsellman (5-3, 4.95 ERA) gets another start Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series against NL East-leading Washington. Gsellman threw 6 2/3 shutout innings Saturday in Atlanta and has won a career-best three straight outings. After making two relief appearances, they are 3-0 with a 2.16 ERA in four starts since returning to the rotation. They face Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez (5-1, 2.91), who is 9-1 with a 1.62 ERA in 14 starts at Citi Field — including a 3-1 win over Jacob deGrom on April 22 during Washington's three-game sweep.

Associated Press
SALEM, Ore. (AP) - The head of Oregon's emergency management agency has apologized after a cryptic emergency alert was forced out to cellphones in and around Oregon's capital city, displaying the words "Civil Emergency" and "Prepare for Action," but carrying little other information.
Andrew Phelps said late Tuesday that a technical glitch had cut off crucial information: that the alert concerned elevated levels of a natural toxin in a local reservoir. Children and people with compromised immune systems have been told not to drink tap water in the Salem, Oregon, area, after an algae bloom caused the spike.
"The integrated public alert warning system inadvertently defaulted to a generic message," Phelps said in a video posted on the social media by the Office of Emergency Management. "I apologize for the confusion and the anxiety this incomplete message has caused."
The incident marked a high-profile glitch in authorities' use of emergency alert systems, following a false alarm sent out by Hawaii officials in January warning of an incoming ballistic missile.
The systems are capable of pushing messages directly to every cellphone in a given area even if users haven't subscribed or downloaded an app. Phelps said the message had also been broadcast via local television stations.
Confusion surrounded the initial alert even within the emergency management agency, with a spokesperson telling reporters the message had caught them unawares and state police asking residents via a Facebook post not to call 911 about the alert.
Officials sent a second message 31 minutes later with more information and a link to a municipal website, which briefly crashed under the load.
Within hours of the alert going out Tuesday night, the aisles at one supermarket in the city's downtown center were stripped of bottled water, and a shopping cart lay tipped on its side in front of the empty shelves. Workers had brought out a pallet of sparkling water, which they placed at the front of the store, and told customers they hoped they'd get more regular water in the morning.
Wednesday morning Cole Mahaffey, a Salem resident, set down a case of bottled water they were carrying down the sidewalk and described the uneasy feeling of seeing the first alert arrive on their phone, with an ominous warning but no other information.
"It almost made me not want to go outside," Mahaffey said, adding that the alert caught them at the gym, and that they had interrupted their exercise routine to ask staff at the front desk if they knew what it was about. "I didn't know if there was something going on in the area, or if there was a shooter, you just had no way of knowing."

NASS invasion: Reps to partner Senate to investigate incident
The House of Representatives on Tuesday resolved to form a committee with the Senate to investigate the invasion of the upper chamber on April 18 by some hoodlums.
This was sequel to a unanimous adoption of a motion by the Chief Whip, Rep. Alhassan Doguwa (Kano-APC), at the plenary.
Moving the motion, Doguwa said that both chambers condemned the invasion of the National Assembly, adding that the Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also condemned the invasion.
They said that it was imperative for legislators to protect themselves to enable them deliver on their mandate.
“Let us protect ourselves even if nobody will; we are doing our job and serving Nigeria and we are not safe.
“Let us form a joint committee of both chambers to investigate the invasion and bring anybody involved to book no matter how highly or lowly placed,” they said.
In their contribution, Chairman, Committee on Financial Crimes, Rep. Oladele Kayode, stressed the need to uphold the sanctity of National Assembly.
They said that a court order was issued within 24 hours restraining the police from arresting the senator who was fingered to have been behind the attacked.
Kayode alleged that the court was interfering in the activities of the assembly and that there was need to re-sound the principle of separation power to the Chief Justice of the Federation (CJN).
“We are heading towards anarchy unless something is done about it,” they added.
In their ruling, Speaker of the House, Mr Yakubu Dogara, said that the resolution would be transmitted to the Senate for concurrence.

CAIRO (AP) — Egypt's chief-of-staff has mediated between two Libyan rivals who refused to meet face to face in Cairo but later agreed to form a committee to renegotiate a U.N. peace deal.
Col. Tamer el-Rifai, an Egyptian army spokesperson, says the two — the head of Libya's U.N.-backed government, Fayez Serraj, and Khalifa Hifter, the country's most powerful army commander — met separately with Egypt's chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Hegazy late on Tuesday.
They say they agreed to form a joint committee that would make key changes to the 2015 U.N.-brokered peace deal.
Once the parliament, based in eastern Libya, endorses the changes, it would pave the way for parliamentary and presidential elections next year.
Libya's east-based parliament does not recognize the U.N.-backed government set up in the country's capital, Tripoli.
DORTMUND, Germany (AP) — Spanish defender Marc Bartra is leaving Borussia Dortmund to join Real Betis.
Dortmund said it made a "big concession" on the transfer fee to allow Bartra return to Spain after what has been a tumultuous spell in the Bundesliga.
Bartra was injured in the bomb attack on Dortmund's team bus before a Champions League game last April. The 27-year-old Spaniard was hit with shrapnel after the blasts shattered a window. They were out for about a month after undergoing surgery on a broken bone in their wrist.
On Monday, Bartra testified at the trial of the man accused of the attack, saying they had feared for their life.
Bartra played 49 competitive games for Dortmund after joining from Barcelona in 2016. While they have played in 12 Bundesliga games this season, Dortmund's signing of Swiss defender Manuel Akanji from FC Basel increased the competition for a starting place.
"I can hardly put in words the moments and feelings that I had in the last one and a half years," Bartra said. "I never thought it possible to receive so much love and support from one of the best football families in the word."
Bartra won the German Cup with Dortmund last year, seven days after coming back from the injuries sustained the bomb attack.

New Year: Atiku urges sacrifice, hope
Former Vice President and chieftain of the Progressives Congress (APC), Atiku Abubakar, has declared 2017 as a year of new hope for Nigeria and Nigerians.
In a statement released to mark the New Year celebrations, the Turakin Adamawa described the outgoing 2016 as a year in which our nation faced a multitude of challenges, but which ended on a high note, giving us hope and confidence in what we as a nation can achieve when we stand to work together.
“Our military has recorded an important victory over Boko Haram and we should be grateful for the sacrifice our men and women in uniform are prepared to make to keep us safe. To honour them, we should also remember that it is our collective responsibility to make peace, and not just in the North East,” they said in the statement.
“I believe we can and will work around our differences, because we know that our strength lies in our diversity. And when we make our New Year's resolutions, I hope my countrymen and countrywomen will join me in aspiring to be tolerant and to listen with an open mind and heart to those who do not share our views. We should respect each other's views and traditions, and we should remember that our humanity shows in how we treat the most vulnerable.”
The Turakin Adamawa also addressed the economic challenges Nigeria is facing.
“On the economic front, the federal government has given assurances of a speedy recovery. I am confident that we will see investments in key sectors, and that steps will be taken to restore business confidence. We've been dealt a cruel hand, but things are looking up, and I'm confident we will emerge stronger: we're learning to be more efficient and effective, and we're learning to evaluate what we really need and what we can afford. We're suffering, but we'll become more innovative and competitive,” they said.
The former Vice President concluded that hope was important to all we aim to achieve in 2017, as that hope and perseverance will guide us through the darkness that announces the break of dawn.
“Hope must be our starting point. We must never stop aspiring for a better future and a better life – for us and for future generations. And we must persevere, changing the small things we can influence without losing sight of the bigger picture,” they said.
They expressed thanksgiving to God for seeing Nigeria through a tough year, noting that the rest of Nigeria's journey could only be made possible with God's help.
“All our hope, our confidence, continues to rest in God,” they said.

NEW YORK (AP) — This may or may not come as a surprise: Merriam-Webster's word of the year for 2017 is "feminism."
Yes, it's been a big year or two or 100 for the word. In 2017, lookups for feminism increased 70 percent over 2016 on Merriam-Webster.com and spiked several times after key events, lexicographer Peter Sokolowski, the company's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Tuesday's annual word reveal.
There were the Women's March on Washington in January, along with sister demonstrations around the globe. And heading into the year was Democrat Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and references linking them to white-clad suffragettes, along with their loss to President Donald Trump, who once boasted about grabbing women.
The "Me Too" movement rose out of Harvey Weinstein's dust, and other "silence breakers" brought down rich and famous men of media, politics and the entertainment worlds.
Feminism has been in Merriam-Webster's annual Top 10 for the last few years, including sharing word-of-the-year honors with other "isms" in 2015. Socialism, fascism, racism, communism, capitalism and terrorism rounded out the bunch. Surreal was the word of the year last year.
"The word feminism was being use in a kind of general way," Sokolowski said by phone from the company's headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts. "The feminism of this big protest, but it was also used in a kind of specific way: What does it mean to be a feminist in 2017? Those kinds of questions are the kinds of things, I think, that send people to the dictionary."
Feminism's roots are in the Latin for "woman" and the word "female," which dates to 14th century English. Sokolowski had to look no further than their company's founder, Noah Webster, for the first dictionary reference, in 1841, which isn't all that old in the history of English.
"It was a very new word at that time," Sokolowski said. "His definition is not the definition that you and I would understand today. Their definition was, 'The qualities of females,' so basically feminism to Noah Webster meant femaleness. We do see evidence that the word was used in the 19th century in a medical sense, for the physical characteristics of a developing teenager, before it was used as a political term, if you will."
Webster added the word in revisions to their "An American Dictionary of the English Language." They were their last. They died in 1843. They also added the word terrorism that year.
"We had no idea they were the original dictionary source of feminism. We don't have a lot of evidence of what they were looking at," Sokolowski said.
Today, Merriam-Webster defines feminism as the "theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes" and "organized activities on behalf of women's rights and interests."
Another spike for the word feminism in 2017 occurred in February, after Kellyanne Conway spoke at the Conservative Political Action Committee.
"It's difficult for me to call myself a feminist in the classic sense because it seems to be very anti-male and it certainly seems to be very pro-abortion. I'm neither anti-male nor pro-abortion," they said. "There's an individual feminism, if you will, that you make your own choices. ... I look at myself as a product of my choices, not a victim of my circumstances. And to me, that's what conservative feminism is all about."
They were applauded, and they sent many people to their dictionaries, Sokolowski said. The company would not release actual lookup numbers.
Other events that drew interest to the word feminism was the popular Hulu series, "The Handmaid's Tale," and the blockbuster movie, "Wonder Woman," directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins, Sokolowski said.
Merriam-Webster had nine runners-up, in no particular order:
— Complicit , competitor Dictionary.com's word of the year.
— Recuse , in reference to Jeff Sessions and the Russia investigation.
— Empathy , which hung high all year.
— Dotard , used by Kim Jong-un to describe Trump.
— Syzygy , the near straight-line configuration of three celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon and earth during a solar or lunar eclipse.
— Gyro , which can be pronounced three different ways, a phenom celebrated in a Jimmy Fallon sketch on "The Tonight Show."
— Federalism , which Lindsey Graham referred to in discussing the future of the Affordable Care Act.
— Hurricane , which Sokolowski suspects is because people are confused about wind speed.
— Gaffe , such as what happened at the Academy Awards when the wrong best picture winner was announced. That was a go-to word for the media, Sokolowski said.
Sig Sauer - Shout out!! Had to send my Kilo 2000 back for repair.
The range button or something between it and the display was intermittent for a while, when the unit was "bumped" on something solid full operation returned.
I ran it that way till no matter how hard or on what it was "bumped" the end result was ziltch.
It was one of, if not the first, unit sold in Idaho. It had a hard life. I was thrilled with it.
email with tracking number from Sig said it arrived today at 12:43. I was away but headed to the mailbox like a kid a Christmas!
Guess what!? I'm very appreciative of Sig Sauer's handling of this.
I was going to sell my 2000 and upgrade to the 2200. But. . . now I don't have to. Sig was kind enough to replace the 2000 with the 2200MR, Class 3R.
Thrilled, to say the least.
Everything about the 2200 is a step up from the 2000.
Optics - Better
Reticle - Better (smaller and pretty much zero'd spot on)
Mill Ranging reticle - nice but I have no use for mils. Prefer and use the "O" ring.
Programming - as easy as the 2000 with one more option - reticle
Heading for some real field work fairly soon. Will report.
Thank you Sig Sauer!

LA PALMA – Kennedy's softball team might have surprised some in the first round of Empire League games, but it certainly earned sole possession of first place Tuesday.
The ninth-ranked Fighting Irish made four highlight reel-worthy defensive plays to support ace Erica Guerrero in a 4-0 victory against visiting Valencia in an unlikely league showdown.
“That's what has been keeping us in games all year,” first-year Kennedy coach Gary Borchardt said of their team's defense. “It's amazing.”
The first noteworthy defensive play from Kennedy (13-5, 5-0) arrived in the first inning. With runners on second and third and two out, right fielder Makenna O'Toole charged a shallow fly ball and made a diving catch to end the threat.
In the third, Kennedy catcher Sam Ferguson slid on their knees to snag a foul ball behind the plate from cleanup hitter Kyra Little for the second out. Valencia (9-13, 4-1) had runners on first and second.
The Fighting Irish produced back-to-back web gems in the fourth to preserve a 3-0 lead. First baseman Megan Hinojos made a diving catch on a foul in front of the Tigers' dugout for the first out.
One batter later, left fielder Melissa Torrez raced toward the fence and made an over-the-shoulder, back-handed grab on a drive by Brenda Enciso.
“They're usually the main part of why we win and why we keep the runs so low,” Guerrero said of the team's defense. “We practice (defense) a lot. This is probably our best year with how many (good) athletes we have. We have a pretty fast team.”
Pacifica is the league's 10-time defending champion. Guerrero (12-2) has been Kennedy's ace for four seasons but beat the Mariners for the first time last week.
The Fighting Irish are aiming for their first league title since 2006.
Valencia also has defeated Pacifica this season, but Guerrero scattered seven hits and struck out five with no walks. The Tigers' top-of-the-order duo of Emily Salazar (3 for 4) and Christina Hurtado (3 for 4) combined for six of the hits.
Kennedy scored three in the first against sophomore Lauren Salcedo. Ferguson drove in the first two runs with a triple and Torrez followed with a RBI squeeze bunt.
“We're just really young,” Valencia second-year coach Kristin Halte said. “I know we're good … but we've been figuring it out.”

PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) — Former NBA star Dennis Rodman, on low-key return to Pyongyang, has given the North Korean sports minister a copy of President Donald Trump's book “The Art of the Deal.”
It wasn't signed by Trump, who was Rodman's boss for two seasons of the “Celebrity Apprentice” reality TV show.
Rodman's arrival on Tuesday came just hours after the North decided to release Otto Warmbier, an American university student who had been imprisoned for 15 years with hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda banner.
Warmbier, who had been confined for 17 months, has apparently fallen into a coma not long after their confinement began. Pyongyang said Thursday saying it decided to let them go for “humanitarian reasons.”
Officials in Washington and Pyongyang said Rodman played no role in the release.

You're all set to watch the eclipse on the 21st: You have all the gear you need, maybe you even took the day off to travel. But then the clouds roll in, or you're stuck indoors at work without windows.
All isn't lost. There are plenty of places you can stream the eclipse online if you're in no position to see it with your own eyes — and you might even get a better view.
When to Tune In
Photo
The first thing you'll need to know is when you should pay attention to the events happening in the sky. This chart from NASA runs down when the eclipse begins and ends, along with when totality (those precious minutes where the moon completely covers the sun, and day turns into night) begins and ends, for each time zone in the United States. This way you'll know exactly when to pop outdoors or go up to the roof to catch the event.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
For example, if you're on the West Coast of the United States, you might want to grab your eclipse glasses or goggles and head outside just after 9 a.m. Pacific, but definitely make sure you don't miss totality around 10:19 a.m. if you live far enough north to see it. Those of us on the East Coast, however, should make sure to head outside just after 1 p.m. Eastern and pay close attention around 2:30 p.m.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A rifle-wielding attacker opened fire on Republican lawmakers as they practiced for a charity baseball game Wednesday, critically wounding House GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and hitting aides and Capitol police as members of congress and others dove for cover. The assailant, who had nursed grievances against President Donald Trump and the GOP, fought a running gun battle with police before he, too, was shot and later died.
Colleagues said Scalise had been fielding balls at second base at a local park in Alexandria, just across the Potomac River from the nation's capital, as the Republicans practiced for their annual game with Democrats. They dragged themselves away from the infield leaving a trail of blood before fellow lawmakers could rush to their assistance. They were listed in critical condition, but their office said that before they underwent surgery for a wound in their hip they were in good spirits and spoke with their wife by telephone.
The shooter was identified as James T. Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector from Illinois who had several minor run-ins with the law in recent years and belonged to a Facebook group called “Terminate the Republican Party.” They had been living out of their van in the Alexandria area in recent months, the FBI said.
Capitol Police officers who were in Scalise's security detail wounded the shooter. They later died of their injuries, Trump told the nation from the White House.
“Everyone on that field is a public servant,” Trump said, their tone somber, America's acrimonious politics set aside for the moment. “Their sacrifice makes democracy possible.”
Lawmakers noted their good fortune in having armed protectors on hand – “Thank God,” they exclaimed over and over – and said otherwise the shooter would have been able to take a huge deadly toll.
The events left the capital horrified and stunned, and prompted immediate reflection on the current hostility and vitriol in American politics. Lawmakers called for a new dialogue on lowering the partisan temperature, and Trump urged Americans to come together as they assumed the role of national unifier for one of the first times in their presidency.
Proceedings were canceled for the day in the House, and instead Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California issued their own calls for unity. “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us,” Ryan said, to prolonged applause.
Shortly after the shooting, Bernie Sanders, the former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said on the Senate floor that the shooter apparently was a volunteer for their campaign last year. Sanders said they denounced the violence “in the strongest possible terms.”
Scalise, 51, the No. 3 House Republican leader, was first elected in 2008. The popular and gregarious lawmaker is known for their love of baseball and handed out commemorative bats when they secured the job of House whip several years ago.
Texas Rep. Roger Williams said that one of their aides, Zack Barth, was shot but was doing well and expected to fully recover. Two Capitol Police officers sustained relatively minor injuries. A former congressional aide was hospitalized.
The shooting occurred at a popular park and baseball complex where Republican lawmakers and others were gathered for a morning practice about 7 a.m. They were in good spirits despite the heat and humidity as they prepared for the annual congressional baseball match that pits Republicans against Democrats. The popular annual face-off, which raises money for charity, is scheduled for Thursday evening at Nationals Park across the Potomac River in Washington, and will go forward as planned.
Hodgkinson has been in the area since March, living out of their van, said Washington FBI Special Agent In Charge Tim Slater. Democratic former Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille said they had spoken often with the man on recent mornings at the nearby YMCA.
Hodgkinson's apparent Facebook page included strong criticism of Republicans and the Trump administration. But Slater said authorities were still working to determine a motive and had no indication Hodgkinson knew about the baseball practice ahead of time.
The GOP lawmakers' team was taking batting practice when gunshots rang out and chaos erupted.
After Scalise was hit, said Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican, the member of congress “crawled into the outfield, leaving a trail of blood.”
“We started giving them the liquids, I put pressure on their wound in their hip,” Brooks said.
The gunman had a rifle and “a lot of ammo,” said Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was at the practice.
Texas Rep. Joe Barton, still in their baseball uniform, told reporters that Scalise's security detail, Capitol Hill police and then Alexandria police returned fire in a battle that lasted as long as 10 minutes and included dozens of shots.
“The security detail saved a lot of lives,” they said. “It was scary.”
Lawmakers took cover in the dugout. Barton said their son, Jack, got under an SUV.
Texas Rep. Mike Conaway described what sounded like an explosion, then lawmakers scattering off the field as police roamed in search of the gunman and engaged him.
“The guy's down to a handgun, they dropped their rifle, they shoot him, I go over there, they put them in handcuffs,” Conaway said, adding that if the shooter had “gotten inside the fence, where a bunch of guys is holed up in the dugout, it would have been like shooting fish in a barrel.”
Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina said they had just left the practice and encountered the apparent gunman in the parking lot before the shooting. The man calmly asked which party's lawmakers were practicing and Duncan told them they were the Republicans. The man thanked him.
The wounded Capitol Police officers were identified as David Bailey, who was treated for a minor injury, and Crystal Griner, who was shot in the ankle. Also wounded was former congressional aide Matt Mika, who now works for Tyson Foods in its Washington office. Mika's family said the lobbyist was shot multiple times and was in critical condition following surgery.
The event raised questions about the security of members of Congress. While the top lawmakers, including Scalise, have security details, others do not and regularly appear in public without protection. The last time a lawmaker was shot was when Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was hit in the head and grievously injured while meeting with constituents at a supermarket parking lot in 2011.
Following the Giffords shooting, lawmakers have held fewer open town halls and have been advised to increase security at such events.

The authors examined 115 different studies, for a total of 7,719 patients, and concluded that certain kinds of antidepressant medications — especially the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.s — were effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in children; the mean age of the children in the study was 9.2 years, with a range of 5 to 16.
There were only a few studies that directly compared them, but they suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy may be even more effective at reducing symptoms and at resolving the anxiety disorders, and that the combination of medication and C.B.T. may be better than either was alone. The drugs were associated with a variety of adverse events, though they did not find the association with suicide attempts that has led to a black box warning on S.S.R.I.s. Still, they have not ruled out those dangers: “The difference may be due to underreporting and monitoring of suicide attempts in clinical trials,” Dr. Wang said.
Dr. Stephen P.H. Whiteside, the director of the Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Clinic at the Mayo Clinic, who was one of the authors of the meta analysis, said, “if your child has difficulties with anxiety, first of all, it's treatable. There are a variety of interventions that can be helpful.”
So which of those children — the parent-clinger, the dog-fearer, the school-avoider — needs psychotherapy or psychopharmacology?
“Anxiety happens in kids,” said Dr. Christopher K. Varley, a professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. “It does not always need treatment.” And it does not always look exactly like what adults think of as anxiety, they said. Kids can have physical symptoms, or become disruptive; headaches and stomachaches and tantrums can all mean that a child is anxious.

“The important questions to me are, is this a problem, is it getting in the way of functioning, is it creating stress for the child and the family, is it causing pain and suffering?” they said.
“A big thing for families is that sometimes anxiety can lead to avoidance behavior in social settings and in school,” Dr. Fernandez said. But staying away from school is only going to make the problem worse, they said. “As a parent, all you want to do is make your child feel safe and feel comfortable, and if they're saying, I only feel safe and comfortable home with my door shut, that can only exacerbate the problem.”
The most helpful form of therapy, Dr. Whiteside said, according to the evidence, is exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy, which involves helping kids face their fears in a supportive environment. “If they're afraid of dogs, they have to practice petting dogs; if they're afraid of talking to people, practice talking to people.” That seems to be of greater value for children with these problems than, for example, therapies based on changing thought patterns, or distractions, or even therapy aimed at deeper insight into the fears.

The message of exposure therapy, Dr. Whiteside said, is that the situations the child is avoiding are not as dangerous as the child's anxiety would suggest, and that the child can cope with the anxiety. “It's an uncomfortable feeling that you can handle,” they said, and the more the child handles it, the more proficient the child will become.
But this takes skill and experience on the therapist's part, and an investment of time and resources by the family. “We found that C.B.T. reports the most consistent outcomes compared to placebo, but it's time-consuming and sometimes in rural areas it's not available,” Dr. Wang said.
The question of medication may arise for children with moderate to severe anxiety, and perhaps ideally for a child who is already getting psychotherapy. But of course, not everyone has access to the experts, or to the recommended forms of therapy. Psychotropic medications are often prescribed by primary care doctors, pediatricians or family physicians, doing their best to help their patients, sometimes getting guidance from a psychiatrist by phone.
“Even though it's a common problem and there are treatments that work, there are still profound problems in the United States with access to psychotherapists who are versed in psychotherapy techniques that have been demonstrated to help,” Dr. Varley said. “And there clearly is a paucity of child psychiatrists.”
In an editorial accompanying the recent meta-analysis, researchers hailed the large numbers of children included, but warned that many children don't respond fully to treatment, and that children who suffer from one form of anxiety disorder are often at high risk to develop another.
“The good news is I've had lots of patients who've had much better experiences and were able to deal with those ups and downs of life, who went to therapy and learned tools to deal, or needed a little help with medication,” said Dr. Fernandez.
Right-wing activists from the Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) movement have demonstrated at the Damascus Gate into Jerusalem's Old City, near the scene of the attack in which Adiel Kolman was murdered yesterday. The activists called "no more permits, enough gifts, death to terrorists, expell the enemies."
Attorney Itamar Ben-Gvir said, "We are completely used to it. No one is even speaking of a siege around the village of the terrorist or the denial of work permits to the residents of the village, and are settling for measuring their private room [for demolition -ed.]. It turns out that the right-wing government is behaving like a left-wing government and [Hamas leader Ismail] Haniyeh can sleep quietly as long as [Avigdor] Liberman is defense minister."
NASS invasion: Reps to partner Senate to investigate incident
The House of Representatives on Tuesday resolved to form a committee with the Senate to investigate the invasion of the upper chamber on April 18 by some hoodlums.
This was sequel to a unanimous adoption of a motion by the Chief Whip, Rep. Alhassan Doguwa (Kano-APC), at the plenary.
Moving the motion, Doguwa said that both chambers condemned the invasion of the National Assembly, adding that the Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also condemned the invasion.
They said that it was imperative for legislators to protect themselves to enable them deliver on their mandate.
“Let us protect ourselves even if nobody will; we are doing our job and serving Nigeria and we are not safe.
“Let us form a joint committee of both chambers to investigate the invasion and bring anybody involved to book no matter how highly or lowly placed,” they said.
In their contribution, Chairman, Committee on Financial Crimes, Rep. Oladele Kayode, stressed the need to uphold the sanctity of National Assembly.
They said that a court order was issued within 24 hours restraining the police from arresting the senator who was fingered to have been behind the attacked.
Kayode alleged that the court was interfering in the activities of the assembly and that there was need to re-sound the principle of separation power to the Chief Justice of the Federation (CJN).
“We are heading towards anarchy unless something is done about it,” they added.
In their ruling, Speaker of the House, Mr Yakubu Dogara, said that the resolution would be transmitted to the Senate for concurrence.

Akeredolu: Ondo will Rise Again
By James Sowole in Akure
The Ondo State Governor-elect, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), yesterday said 2017 would mark the beginning of new thinking and new actions in the state and assured the people of a new year of all encompassing positive changes.
Akeredolu expressed this optimism in their new year message signed by their media adviser, Yemi Olowolabi and entitled: ‘Ondo State Shall Rise Again.”
The governor-elect, who said: “We cannot be doing something the same way and expect a different result,” charged the people to support the incoming administration to emplace a culture of integrity in public service.
They also called on politicians and public servants to be prepared to make sacrifices with a view to making the state great again.
Akeredolu said the state has stupendous natural endowments and abundant human resources waiting to be harnessed for the good of the state by selfless leadership.
The governor-elect restated their determination to run a transparent government that is irrevocably committed to developing the state, taking it to enviable heights; notwithstanding the present economic challenges in the country.
They noted that recovery can only be achieved when those in positions of authority make transparency and integrity their watchwords.
Akeredolu lauded the anti-corruption war of President Muhammadu Buhari, noting that with such widespread clampdown on corruption in Nigeria, there is no more hiding place for corrupt practices in the country and particularly in the state.

A white nationalist rally planned on Texas A&M University's campus has been canceled, apparently out of concern for student safety, officials confirmed Monday.
The school made the decision after consulting law enforcement and "considerable study" because of "concerns about the safety of its students, faculty, staff and the public."
"Texas A&M's support of the First Amendment and the freedom of speech cannot be questioned," the university said in a statement Monday afternoon.
"However, in this case circumstances and information relating to the event have changed and the risks of threat to life and safety compel us to cancel the event."
After the event was announced over the weekend, university and state leaders expressed strong objections, but legal experts and one A&M System regent had fretted that First Amendment protections made that impossible.
Reached by phone while shopping at Walmart on Monday afternoon, Wiginton said they had not heard the news. They said they had signed up to protest at a “free speech area” on campus on Sept. 11, but had not heard from anyone at the school since they announced. Their response: “I guess my lawyers will now be suing the state of Texas.”
The news was first announced on the floor of the Texas House. The lawmaker who made the declaration was Rep. John Raney, R-College Station, whose district includes A&M. They said that A&M System Chancellor John Sharp had canceled the event to protect student safety.
Raney said the event was axed "because of concerns with hate messages that have been on Facebook, and people who've said they were coming and they were bringing their weapons." They added the local police department said they "can't handle that."
Earlier in the afternoon, lawmakers had urged university administrators – and Sharp, in particular – to prevent the event from happening. Gov. Greg Abbott was also involved in the discussion, an Abbott spokesperson said.
“The Governor's office has been working with Texas A&M University to prevent the type of hate-filled event that we saw in Charlottesville. Governor Abbott's top goal is to ensure the safety and security of Texans and Texas A&M students,” said the spokesperson, John Wittman.

The German government has taken a hard line against internet providers and what they can disseminate through a network enforcement law that is not popular in some quarters, said Gunter Krings, the parliamentary state secretary for Germany's interior ministry.
"Certainly, the companies didn't like it so much. But it's also clear that the standards of what can be communicated on the internet can't be set by the terms and conditions of private contracts," Krings said in an interview.
"These standards have to be set by democratically elected lawmakers, who decide on what is libel, what is defamation and how far can you go in even an open society."
Goodale said cybertechnology has become "a disruptive force" with the potential to harm critical infrastructure "and the power to more easily conceal identities."
Internet companies not only need to work faster to remove offensive material, they need to play a broader role in disseminating "counter-narratives" including to those searching terrorist-related material, they said.
Companies and governments also need to do more to improve the level of digital literacy among citizens "so that people can be more proactive themselves in identifying fake news, for example, and dubious sources of information."
The ministers also discussed how to guard against ongoing domestic threats, as the Toronto attack gave new urgency to a discussion of fortifying so-called soft targets.
Goodale pointed to the dump trucks and cement barricades that were erected near Toronto's Union Station and Air Canada Centre following Monday's attack.
Though nothing has emerged so far to link Monday's events in Toronto to extremism, the use of a vehicle as a weapon against pedestrians is something that Goodale's British, French, American and German counterparts are all too familiar with.
"The discussions yesterday afternoon and this morning were overshadowed, of course by the terrible tragic incident here in Toronto," said Krings.
Krings said the Toronto attack was similar to one in the German city of Munster three weeks ago that killed two people and wounded dozens more.
"The fear was that it's a terror attack, but it also turned out to be a mentally ill person," Krings said, stressing that they didn't want to leap to any conclusions about the Toronto attack.
Krings said the incidents show that countries face serious security threats and not just from terrorism. They and several other ministers around the table never lost sight of a key point: "We might be, on a professional level, relieved that there's no nexus, connection to (a) national security terrorist question. For the people that die, for their family, for the injured people, it really doesn't matter."

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Mideast envoy says the latest escalation in Gaza between its Hamas rulers and Israel is a warning of "how close to the brink of war we are every day."
Nikolay Mladenov told an emergency Security Council meeting on Wednesday that the international community should "unequivocally condemn" Hamas' rocket and mortar attack against Israel.
But they said "the dangerous escalation" can't be divorced from two months of protests at the Gaza fence in which some 110 Palestinians were killed and large numbers injured by Israeli fire.
The Security Council remained paralyzed, unable to agree on any action.
U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who called the meeting, said a proposed statement to condemn the Hamas attacks was blocked. The U.S. previously blocked three statements to condemn Israeli killings during the protests.

Logistics firm unveils platform to connect SMEs globally
A LOGISTICS company, Red Star Express, has unveiled plans to connect Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) in the country and empower them to operate on global standard.
Group Managing Director of the company, Mr Sola Obabori, launched the project in Lagos as part of activities to mark the firm's 25th anniversary. They said that the initiative tagged, “SME 1000”, is meant to help entrepreneurs, especially upcoming ones, get firmly rooted, grow and possibly compete with favorably with competing brands globally. According to Obabori, “SMEs have always being there but it is the ability to grow into a business that has been the problem. In Nigeria we have failed in succession planning unlike in foreign countries,
Global business
That is why RedStar is focused on helping entrepreneurs become big and push them to the global market. Various governments have tried in pushing SMEs. Take for instance in Abia State, the government has tried to push products made in Abia State to the global market and try to promote commerce.”
“Red Star chose to embark on this SME 1000 project in order to promote and create a platform to connect these SMEs globally, because RedStar is a global business which can connect with any part of the world in 72 hours. We want to bring 1000 SMEs together to partner with them and create opportunities and network for them in order to enable them understand the process of running an SME. We understand that some of the challenges of coming up with an SME is infrastructure, inconsistency, succession plans, lack of focus, amongst others. Subscription for the SME 1000 is already on, and there is a large crowd of people interested. We have gotten calls and we partnered with the chamber of commerce. There is also a large network of people. To participate, interested entrepreneurs should just visit our website, fill the forms, and someone will be with them to discuss through an engagement.
Obabori further stated that Red Star has a target to mentor and monitor the SMEs so that by the year 2020, the company can showcase some of these SMEs that have grown and established themselves in Nigeria as a success story. “We realized that many companies have packed up as a result of economic recession, and that's why Red Star decided to embark on this SME project. We also realized that in starting up a business, the first five years are the most critical time but once the company gets to 10 years, it begins to stabilize and the public can begin to trust it,” they added.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court has upheld a challenged practice that is used to invalidate patents without the involvement of federal courts.
The justices on Tuesday rejected a bid to strike down a process established by Congress in 2011 to speed up patent reviews.
The justices voted 7-2 in favor of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's patent review process. It has been used to invalidate hundreds of patents since it was established in 2012.
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented.

Kyle Lowry said something had to change in Toronto. Serge Ibaka is on their way to try to make that happen. The Raptors acquired the veteran power forward from Orlando on Tuesday for Terrence Ross and a 2017 first round draft pick. Orlando general manager Rob Hennigan said Tuesday evening the trade of Ibaka for Ross was necessary for the Magic to have a chance of salvaging a season that has gone drastically off course. The Raptors made the move with the postseason and possible championship run in mind. “Any time you can add a talent who has got playoff experience, (NBA) Finals experience, and a defender and two-way player like Ibaka has got to give us a boost,” Raptors coach Dwane Casey said Tuesday night in Chicago before the Raptors-Bulls game. “Ibaka fills a huge need. “His style of play fits our style of play. … There's nothing we're doing that they haven't seen before. It won't take them long to pick up the terminology.” Toronto started the day in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, having lost 10 of its previous 14 games. The latest ugly performance came on Sunday when the Raptors gave up a 16-point lead to start the fourth quarter and lost to the Detroit Pistons. After the game, Lowry didn't pull any punches on the state of a team that made the Eastern Conference finals last season but has lost to the Magic twice, the Pistons, Timberwolves and Suns during this latest swoon. “Keep getting in the same situations over and over and not being successful,” Lowry said after the 102-101 loss. “Something's got to give, something's got to change.” Casey has said all season long that the something is defense. Toronto ranks 17th in the NBA in defensive efficiency, allowing 106.2 points per 100 possessions. The coach knows that won't be close to good enough when they get into the playoffs to try to build off of last year's run to the Eastern Conference finals. “Like most players, they have migrated out on the perimeter, so their shot-blocking and rebounding (numbers) are down a little bit,” Casey said of Ibaka. “But there are a lot of difference positions they can play for us. “He can play close to the basket, because he's smart and versatile. There are situations that they could possibly play the 5 for us if we do go small. They give us a lot of flexibility.” Ibaka averaged 15.1 points and 6.8 rebounds for the Magic this season. They have long been considered a rugged defensive power forward, and has experience making deep playoff runs with the Thunder. They will be a free agent this summer after being acquired from Oklahoma City on draft night last summer for Victor Oladipo, Ersan Ilyasova and the first-round draft pick that became Domantas Sabonis. Now Ibaka will slide between DeMarre Carroll and Jonas Valanciunas in the Raptors frontcourt, a significant upgrade for Raptors GM Masai Ujiri, who has long been a fan of Ibaka's defensive tenacity and ability to stretch the floor on offense. The Raptors parted with Ross, who is in the first year of a three-year, $31 million contract, and a pick to get the deal done. Ross averaged 10.4 points and 2.6 rebounds, but the high flier has never been able to provide Toronto with the consistency they were looking for from him. “I think if you watch our team play there is no secret that we struggle to make shots and I think their ability can do just that,” said Hennigan, who still believes their team has a shot at making the Eastern Conference playoffs despite a 21-36 record. Ross' “play, their age and their contract are all things we feel are positives and strengths for us.” The Magic made the move in part to try to get something back for Ibaka before risking losing them on the open market this summer. Hennigan made the deal with OKC on draft night in hopes that Ibaka's defense and veteran leadership would help a team with a young core including Aaron Gordon, Evan Fournier and Elfrid Payton. But Orlando created a logjam in the frontcourt with Ibaka, Gordon, Nikola Vucevic and Bismack Biyombo, and pieces just never fit together. The Magic have the second-worst record in the East. Raptors guard Norman Powell, who is expected to have an expanded role in Toronto with Ross' departure, said their former teammate is looking forward to their new role with the Magic. “I talked to (Ross) and he's excited about the opportunity they have” in Orlando, Powell said. With Ross joining the team, the Magic can now shift Gordon back to their more natural power forward spot, leaving Evan Fournier and Ross to play the wing positions in coach Frank Vogel's scheme. “I think we will certainly look at that and try that, but that will be Frank's call ultimately,” said Hennigan, who hopes Ross will be in uniform Wednesday night against the Spurs. “But it's something that Frank and I have been discussing and certainly discussed even more today.” — AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Miami, and Associated Press Writers Terrance Harris in Orlando, Florida, and Paul Ladewski in Chicago contributed to this report.

STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS & USED WITH PERMISSION
After an exhaustive investigation, SpaceX engineers have identified the most likely cause of the spectacular explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket during a pre-launch test Sept. 1 that destroyed the booster and its $195 million satellite payload, the company announced Monday.
SpaceX engineers believe the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station mishap was triggered by the failure of a high-pressure helium tank, one of three used to pressurize the second stage liquid oxygen tank.
Putting corrective actions in place, the company said Monday it plans to resume flights with a launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base northwest of Los Angeles on Jan. 8 to boost 10 Iridium NEXT satellite telephone relay stations into orbit.
It is not yet known when SpaceX plans to resume flights from Cape Canaveral. Launch complex 40 at the Florida Air Force station was heavily damaged in the Sept. 1 mishap, and the company plans to use a repurposed space shuttle launch pad at the nearby Kennedy Space Center for its next Falcon 9 flight from Florida.
Sources indicate the first flight from Kennedy will be another commercial mission. The next SpaceX flight to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, the company's 10th under contract to NASA, is expected to take place some time after the commercial mission.
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket uses super-cooled, or “densified,” liquid oxygen and RP-1 kerosene fuel to provide additional performance during ascent. To achieve and maintain the desired low temperatures, propellant loading begins just 35 minutes before launch.
To push propellants to the rocket's engines, the Falcon 9 uses highly pressurized helium stored in aluminum bottles, wrapped in a tough, insulating carbon composite material. The bottles, known as composite overwrap pressure vessels, or COPVs, are mounted inside the propellant tanks, submerged in frigid liquid oxygen and chilled kerosene.
On Sept. 1, about five minutes before a planned test firing of the Falcon's nine Merlin 1D first stage engines — a routine pre-launch test for SpaceX — the second stage suddenly exploded in a spectacular conflagration that was caught on video and widely seen around the world.
The rocket and it's $195 million payload, a commercial communications satellite, were destroyed, causing heavy damage to launch complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Just 93 milliseconds elapsed from the first signs of trouble to the explosion.
“Investigators scoured more than 3,000 channels of video and telemetry data covering a very brief timeline of events,” SpaceX said in a statement posted to its website. “Because the failure occurred on the ground, investigators were also able to review umbilical data, ground-based video, and physical debris.
“To validate investigation analysis and findings, SpaceX conducted a wide range of tests at its facilities in Hawthorne, California and McGregor, Texas.”
SpaceX is generally tight-lipped when it comes to technical details, and the statement posted Monday provided only a general overview of the team's findings. It said accident investigators “concluded that one of the three composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) inside the second stage liquid oxygen (LOX) tank failed.”
“Specifically, the investigation team concluded the failure was likely due to the accumulation of oxygen between the COPV liner and overwrap in a void or a buckle in the liner,” the company said.
Investigators believe those extremely low temperatures may have caused some of that trapped oxygen to solidify. In any case, when the tank was pressurized, trapped oxygen pushing against the carbon overwrap fibers likely generated friction “leading to ignition and the subsequent failure of the COPV.”
Liquid oxygen has a temperature of around minus 298 degrees Fahrenheit, but SpaceX chills the propellant to around minus 340 degrees for use aboard the Falcon 9. The RP-1 kerosene fuel, which normally is stored at a room temperature 70 degrees, also is chilled. The lower temperatures increase the propellants' density.
A rocket engine's thrust is directly proportional to the rate propellants are consumed and expelled. By “densifying” the Falcon 9 propellants, more fuel can be stored and pumped through the engines, increasing performance.
While earlier rockets, including the Titan 2 booster used to launch NASA's Gemini spacecraft in the 1960s, used propellant cooling to increase density, and thus engine performance, the upgraded Falcon 9 is believed to be the first utilizing super-cooled cryogenic oxygen.
SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in 2015, when propellant cooling was first implemented in the Falcon 9, that “we're sub-cooling the propellant, particularly the liquid oxygen, close to its freezing point, which increases the density quite significantly.”
Failure investigators “identified several credible causes for the COPV failure, all of which involve accumulation of super chilled LOX or SOX (solidified oxygen) in buckles under the overwrap,” the company said in its statement.
“The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as returning helium loading operations to a prior flight proven configuration based on operations used in over 700 successful COPV loads.”
The company did not provide any details about those earlier helium loading procedures but said it plans to redesign the helium bottles in the long term “to prevent buckles altogether, which will allow for faster loading operations.”
The Sept. 1 failure was the second involving the Falcon 9's second-stage helium pressurization system.
During a June 2015 launch to deliver supplies to the space station, a strut holding a second-stage helium tank in place inside the liquid oxygen tank failed, allowing the helium bottle to shoot up and crash into the top of the oxygen tank, triggering a catastrophic rupture.
It was SpaceX's first outright Falcon 9 failure in 19 launchings dating back to the rocket's maiden flight in June 2010. After taking steps to ensure all internal struts met design specifications, SpaceX launched nine successful missions in a row before the Sept. 1 launch pad disaster, all of them using densified propellants.
ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Chris Lewis scored 17 points and Harvard came from four-points down in the final minutes to pull out a 76-73 win at Cornell in an Ivy League battle Saturday night.
The Crimson, the preseason Ivy League favorite, remains a game back of unbeaten conference leader Penn.
Stone Gettings hit two free throws with 4:43 to put the Big Red up by four, 66-62, but Lewis made two free throws and Danilo Djuricic hit a 3 with 3:09 left to put Harvard in front, 67-66.
Jack Gordon got Cornell even with the first of two free throws, but Seth Towns drilled a 3 with 2:25 remaining and from there Justin Bassey, Christian Juzang and Corey Johnson each hit a pair of free throws to preserve the win.
Towns finished with 15 points, seven boards and six assists for Harvard (10-11, 5-1).
Gettings scored 32 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Big Red (8-11, 2-4). Matt Morgan added 16 points and dished six assists.

This Open Letter to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie discusses Feminism, Egalitarianism & Respect
Since Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie asked Hillary Clinton if it was their choice to identify themselves first as a wife on their Twitter bio, and why, the internet has been awash with comments for and against.
In what can be tagged as their contribution to the topic, Co-Director of Startup Grind Lagos Blessing Abeng, in a Twitter thread, also published on their blog einsteinette.com, they highlight their “issue with feminism,” and why egalitarianism is better for them
“You can't ask for equality of the sexes and have bias for one of the sexes,” they say, adding that individuals should get appointments or contracts based on merit and not gender bias. “Treat every human as their own person, not as a male or female,” they add.

CyberScoop reports that Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, US District Judge for the District of Columbia, rejected Kaspersky's claims that the bans were unconstitutional. Kaspersky argued that the NDAA inflicted an unconstitutional "punishment," but Judge Kollar-Kotelly disagreed. They said the act wasn't a punishment but instead, "eliminates a perceived risk to the nation's cybersecurity and, in so doing, has the secondary effect of foreclosing one small source of revenue for a large multinational corporation."
Further, because they dismissed the lawsuit against the NDAA, the suit against the Department of Homeland Security's order was rendered moot since the act would supercede any change to the order. "These defensive actions may very well have adverse consequences for some third-parties," they said in their opinion. "But that does not make them unconstitutional."
The NDAA's Kaspersky ban goes into effect on October 1st.

By Jeff Mason
HONOLULU (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will deliver a farewell address on Jan. 10 to reflect on their time in office and say thank you to their supporters, they said in an email statement released on Monday.
Obama, noting that the first president of the United States, George Washington, had penned a farewell address in 1796, said they would deliver their speech in their hometown of Chicago.
"I'm thinking about (the remarks) as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here," they said.
Republican Donald Trump will be sworn in to office on Jan. 20. During their campaign for the White House, Trump pledged to undo many of Obama's signature policy measures, including their healthcare law.
Obama, who campaigned hard for Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, has sought to ensure a smooth transition of power despite major policy differences with their successor. They also leaf their party without a clear figurehead as they leaf the White House.
"Since 2009, we've faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger," Obama said in the email, likely foreshadowing a theme for their speech.
"That's because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding - our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better."

Five of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history have occurred since 2012, the same year that a troubled young man killed 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
A list of some of the deadliest mass shootings:
— Oct. 1, 2017: Stephen Paddock opened fire on an outdoor music festival on the Las Vegas Strip from the 32nd floor of a hotel-casino, killing 58 people and wounding more than 500. SWAT teams with explosives then stormed their room and found they had killed himself.
— June 12, 2016: Omar Mateen opened fire at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub, killing 49 people. Mateen was later killed in a shootout with police.
— April 16, 2007: Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others in separate attacks on campus before killing himself.
— Dec. 14, 2012: In Newtown, Connecticut, an armed 20-year-old man entered Sandy Hook Elementary School and used a semi-automatic rifle to kill 26 people, including 20 first-graders and six adult school staff members. They then killed himself.
— Nov. 5, 2017: Devin Patrick Kelley, who had been discharged from the Air Force after a conviction for domestic violence, used an AR-style firearm to shoot up a congregation at a small church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing more than two dozen.
— Oct. 16, 1991: George Hennard drove their pickup truck though the front window of Luby's restaurant in Killeen, Texas, and then fatally shot 23 people, wounded 27 others and then killed themselves after a shootout with police.
— July 18, 1984: James Huberty drove to a McDonald's in the San Ysidro neighborhood of San Diego, California, armed with an Uzi submachine gun, a shotgun and a handgun. They shot and killed 21 people, injured 19 and then was killed by a police sniper.
— Dec. 2, 2015: Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27, opened fire at a social services center in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and wounding more than 20. They fled the scene but died hours later in a shootout with police.
— Aug. 20, 1986: Postal worker Patrick Sherrill shot 20 co-workers, killing 14 of them, in Edmond, Oklahoma. They then committed suicide.
— Aug. 1, 1966: Charles Whitman, a onetime Marine sharpshooter, opened fire on the University of Texas at Austin campus from its clocktower, killing 13 people and an unborn child and injuring around 30 others. Whitman also killed their mother and wife the night before. One shooting victim died a week later and medical examiners attributed a 17th death to Whitman in 2001.
PUNXSUTAWNEY — In the town of Punxsutawney, Groundhog Day starts long before the clock turns one tick past 11:59 p.m. on February 1st. Weeks of preparation go into carrying out the events surrounding Punxsutawney Phil's annual prognostication, and hours are poured into the final few days ahead of welcoming thousands of guests to town.
But anyone who lives here — or who's spent a whole lot of time here — knows that for one short period of time, the whole world is watching and waiting for Phil to do their thing. Each year, on the morning of February 2nd, the beloved groundhog awakens from their slumber, and with a bit of coaxing from Punxsutawney Groundhog Club Inner Circle President Bill Deeley, they make their way out of their comfy stump to tell all those folks whether they should expect six more weeks of winter or an early spring.
Many approach the festivities with a bit of hope for a new spring, but it's the winter-loving folk in the group who win out most often. In fact, over the course of ‘Hog History, Phil has reported seeing their shadow 103 times in 121 prognostications for which the results were recorded (with 10 of their treks having no official report). That's a not-so-promising 14.87% success rate for the #earlyspring crowd.
This year, as is the custom, Phil's Inner Circle members began their trek down toward Gobbler's Knob right around 7:10 a.m. on Friday. Of course, Phil's fans had been flocking to the site in far-below-freezing temperatures for hours (since the Knob opened around 3 a.m.), but four hours later, it was time to get down to business.
At 7:17 a.m., those gathered at the Knob helped draw Phil out of their warm abode by chanting their name, and Deeley rapped on their door to complete the process. And when The Seer of Seers emerged, they were greeted with yet another cheer from the crowd.
Speaking to Deeley in Groundhogese, the official language of the ‘hog, Phil directed them to one of two scrolls to issue their prediction. That full prediction can be read on the scroll below, but it can also be easily summarized: Six more weeks of winter.
As is always the case, the call was met with a bit of a mixed reaction, though most never hold a grudge for long. After all, Phil's not making the news, he's just reporting it! And with that, preparations for Groundhog Day 2019 are officially underway.
Prior to Phil's 132nd prognostication, the official festivities began at 6:30 a.m. with the “official Groundhog Day house band” The Beagle Brothers bringing their folk-style feel to “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Then, the town got its official wake-up call with the annual fireworks show kicking off immediately afterwards.
Then, the group stayed warm by doing a bit of dancing and singing, with the help of the Punxsutawney Philette Dancers, a group of eight high school seniors who helped keep spirits high despite the chilly temperatures.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah woman has been arrested after they were identified as the pajama-wearing robber in at least six bank robberies in the Salt Lake City area, including five in less than two hours on Saturday morning, police said Monday.
Nannette Louise Perkins, 40, was arrested Sunday afternoon at home in suburban Taylorsville home after Salt Lake City police received a tip about their identity, Unified police Lt. Brian Lohrke said.
According to police, the robber did little to hide their appearance during robberies Friday and Saturday morning at banks in Salt Lake City, Holladay, West Valley City, Cottonwood Heights and Sandy.
They were seen on bank surveillance camera images and described wearing pajama bottoms, black prescription eyeglasses, a dark shirt and a blue bandanna over dark hair in a ponytail or bun.
Lohrke said the robber passed notes to tellers, never showed a weapon and got cash in five of the six banks. They left one empty-handed.
The police spokesperson said they did not know what Perkins was wearing when they were arrested.
They were being held at the Salt Lake County jail pending an initial court appearance on felony charges.

The remains of a woman found Wednesday afternoon in a wooded area adjacent to a Birmingham apartment complex have been identified.
Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Bill Yates said today that investigators do not yet know enough about the cause of the death of Ieasha Shakinna Abrams, 34, for officials to launch a homicide investigation.
Researchers with the coroner's office also have not yet been able to determine how long Abrams had been deceased when their partially-skeletonized remains were discovered.
A court in western Germany has ruled that a German man must serve the sentence of a Chilean court for their role in the sexual abuse of children at a secretive German colony in Chile.
The dpa news agency reported Monday that the court in the town of Krefeld said Hartmut Hopp must serve in Germany the five-year sentence given to them by a Chilean court in 2011 for 16 counts of aiding in the sexual abuse of children.
The crimes took place at the Colonia Dignidad enclave, where residents were physically and psychologically abused for three decades beginning in 1961 after moving there from Germany.
Hopp fled to Germany before the verdict took legal effect.
The 73-year-old denies the charges and their attorney says they will appeal the ruling.
A man who may have been trying to kill themselves rammed their car into a pizzeria east of Paris on Monday, killing a 13-year-old girl and injuring their younger brother and at least 11 others, authorities said.
The driver was immediately arrested. Police said the man's actions in the town of Sept-Sorts were deliberate, but not thought to be terrorism-related.
The 13-year-old girl and their brother were among the restaurant patrons eating on the outdoor terrace of Pizzeria Cesena when a man in a BMW accelerated toward them, an official with the national gendarme service told The Associated Press.
The girl died immediately, while the boy's injuries are considered life-threatening, the official said. At least three others were hospitalized in serious condition, and eight more sustained light injuries, said the official, who was not authorized to be publicly named.
The incident reignited fears in France after a string of attacks in which a vehicle was the weapon of choice. An Algerian man drove their car into a group of French soldiers last week, and an Islamic extremist truck attack in the French city of Nice left 86 people dead a little more than a year ago.
The man arrested in Monday's attack is thought to have tried to kill themselves last week, French Interior Ministry Pierre-Henry Brandet said on BFM television. Brandet said the man, born in 1985, was not known to intelligence or police. They did not identify him.
Two police officials said the incident is considered over and authorities are not searching for accomplices, but to find out what motivated the driver.
A judicial official said Monday night that the Paris prosecutor's office, which oversees French terrorism investigations, was not involved in the case because there was no proof of terrorism at this stage. A security official echoed that there was no evidence of a political or Islamic extremist motive.
The targeted pizzeria is in a shopping zone in the town of Sept-Sorts about 65 kilometers (40 miles) east of Paris near Champagne country. Police cordoned off a large perimeter of the area.

Associated Press writer Angela Charlton reported this story from Paris and AP videographer Olgeg Cetinic reported in Sept-Sorts.
Louis Oosthuizen pointed to their lack of success on the greens as they fell short in their bid to chase down Justin Thomas at Quail Hollow, writes WADE PRETORIUS.
READ: Thomas the king of Quail Hollow
Oosthuizen now has the unwanted ‘honour' of runner-up finishes in all of golf's Majors after adding the 2017 PGA Championship to their 2012 Masters defeat to Bubba Watson and their 2015 runner-up finishes at the US Open and The Open – another playoff defeat this time to Zach Johnson.
The Mossel Bay star carded a 70 on Sunday with a chip-in eagle on 15 and a 60 foot birdie on the last their only real highlights.
“I didn't really make any putts the whole round, the only putt I made was on the last hole,' said Oosthuizen.
Just when they moved themselves into contention on the back nine on Sunday, they missed the fairway on the must-birdie 10th hole which left them settling for par before pushing their drive on the 11th which resulted in a costly bogey.
‘Two loose shots on ten and 11 probably cost me one, maybe two shots,' they said.
And then came the eagle on 15 which vaulted them right back into contention at a time Kevin Kisner and Hideki Matsuyama were faltering in running Thomas close. But another error on 16, they found the fairway bunker leaving themselves a 90 foot putt for birdie which meant their race was run when they failed to get down in two.
‘I gave it everything I had coming in. I left myself with an impossible first putt on 16 and could have done better than that but three-putted. And then difficult hitting it close on 17, trying to make birdie. Hit one good putt on 18.'
The win did have the added bonus of a seven place rankings jump – read that story HERE!

Jon Rahm also had a chance to get to No. 1 in January until a 75-77 weekend at Torrey Pines.
With so many big tournaments coming up, a half-dozen players are in the mix for No. 1 by the end of the season.
BEST SEASON
Patrick Reed can easily claim this because of that green jacket they love to (and should) show off. Winning the Masters makes it a great year no matter what else happens, and Reed will have a hard time topping this one even if they win all five Ryder Cup matches in France.
Three others are worthy of consideration.
Thomas faced a most difficult encore after they won five times last season, including their first major, the PGA Championship, and the FedEx Cup. They have backed it up so far with two victories. One of them was the Honda Classic, where they made two birdies on the par-5 18th — with a wedge to force a playoff, and with a 5-wood to set up the win.
Watson won against two strong fields at Riviera and Match Play. Kizzire won't get as much recognition from winning at the OHL Classic at Mayakoba in the fall and the Sony Open in January. But they went head-to-head in beating Rickie Fowler in Mexico and won a six-hole playoff on Oahu. In a rarity, they won twice in a season while ranked outside the top 100 in the world.
TIGER ANNIVERSARY
One year ago, the Texas Open was the same week Woods had their fourth back surgery, and all sorts of speculation followed. Would they ever play again? Did they even want to play again? And if they did, how much would fusion surgery limit him?
The answers: Yes, yes and not much.
They recorded a swing speed of 129 mph. They were runner-up by one shot at the Valspar Championship. A year ago, no one would have been surprised if they missed the Masters. Instead, the surprise was that they didn't break par until Sunday and tied for 32nd.
Interesting about Woods at this point in the season is that they played three of their six tournaments on courses where they have never won.
THE REVIVALS
Even as the PGA Tour gets younger, five players in their 40s managed to win.
Phil Mickelson tops the list. Ian Poulter isn't too far behind.
Their victory drought approaching five years, Mickelson was on the verge of falling out of the top 50 in the world for the first time in 25 years when they ran off four consecutive top 10s, the last one a playoff victory in the Mexico Championship.
Poulter had gone more than six years without a win, would have lost their full PGA Tour card last year except for a clerical error and then was told at the Dell Match Play that they were in the Masters, when in fact they needed to win one more match (which they lost badly). Poulter opened with a 73 the following week in Houston, answered with rounds of 64-65, made a 30-foot birdie putt on the 18th to force a playoff and won on the first extra hole to get into the Masters.
Those victories will go a long way in getting Mickelson and Poulter to France in the fall as captain's picks if they don't qualify for their Ryder Cup teams.
But it's early.
Even though one half of the season is gone, the bigger half is coming up.

Affirmative Action Group (AAG) has asked President Robert Mugabe and Indigenisation minister Patrick Zhuwao to reverse Barclays' sale of its Zimbabwe bank to Malawi-listed First Merchant Bank (FMB).
The lobby group's president, Chamu Chiwanza, yesterday told a news conference in the capital that the sale — part of the British lender's broader exit from Africa to refocus on the United States and Britain — was in direct violation of the country's indigenisation law.
Zimbabwe's indigenisation policy requires that foreign-owned companies own no more than 49 percent in local firms.
“We have noted with great concern the events of the past weeks, the sale of Barclays Bank Zimbabwe (BBZ) to FMB. We as AAG strongly feel there is serious contempt and disregard of the law because the law is very clear that locals have the first right of refusal…
“We are making a public outcry that this deal must be interrogated, as AAG we would want it to be reversed. Surely, it must be reversed. We are saying to the policymakers they must tread very carefully, they are there at the expense of the people and we are looking at what they are doing very carefully… We welcome foreigners but not at our expense,” they said.
According to the deal hammered out by a team of lawyers, including London's Norton Rose and Addington Chinake of Kantor & Immerman, FMB will hold a 42 percent stake, Barclays 10 percent until 2020 and other sitting shareholders will retain their 33 percent.
The deal — expected to complete in the third quarter of this year — also ruffled feathers at the bank, leaving the financial institution's 700 employees moving to lobby government to block the bank's takeover by Malawi's FMB.
In their bid to block the sale, BBZ employees, reportedly led by managing director George Guvamatanga also had support of the State pension fund National Social Security Authority (Nssa).
Chiwanza pointed out that the management bid to buy the bank deserved first preference as per the country's black empowerment laws.
“Locals were offering the same kind of money, it is in United States dollars (US$) by the way, and for some strange reason, for the first time RBZ is now saying they don't interfere in private sale of equity but as regulators it is their mandate to make sure that the law has been implemented…
“We do not want bread crumbs, this is why we have empowerment laws, and we want the bread itself. We have locals who are bidding to buy the 68 percent equity in that bank, they have got the money. Why are we taking foreign money at the expense of locals?” the AAG boss said.
“If we are not going to implement a law, then we must not put the law into place… It must never exist. If a law have been put into effect, it must be implemented. This is our outcry. The law is the law.
“Let us not try to find means and ways to accustom particular situations to suit certain individuals. The law must be implemented across the board,” said Chiwanza.
The AAG president also said the sale exposed government's policy inconsistency.
“The problem that we are having is that we are very good as Zimbabweans with putting policy to paper but very bad with implementing policy. There is no consistency here…
“So, we are very worried and we are probably going to lobby even to the highest office in the land to interrogate the BBZ transaction and how FMB was chosen over the locals to take over equity,” they said.
This comes as the Zimbabwe Monetary Institute (ZMI) last week wrote to Zhuwao with a similar request, asking them to block the sale. Daily News
Three men have been arrested in Ewerby after a number of reports to police after alleged bogus fish sellers going door to door.
According to a Lincolnshire Police spokesperson there had been reports of men going door to door in Helpringham claiming to be selling fish to householders.
Three men from the Durham area, aged 23, 41 and 56 were said to have been arrested yesterday (Monday) in Main Street, Ewerby, on suspicion of fraud by false representation.
“They have all been released under investigation. They have not been charged at this stage,” said the spokesperson.
Lincolnshire Police had recently put out an alert warning people about bogus fish sellers.
Residents in the Sleaford area had issued warnings via Facebook over the last week about fish sellers going door to door in Scredington and Greylees.
There was also a report of an elderly woman allegedly duped into buying £156 worth of fish in Wyberton, near Boston.
Barbara Lawlor, Gilpin County. Vince Suich, in new umpire clothes because their old uniform made them look like a sixth grader in their dad's clothes, stood behind first base for five games on Saturday calling the plays. It rained on and off, enough to chill them through and through. At the end of the day their muscles ached and they were tired. On Sunday, they returned to the ball field to ump four more games.
It was the Tonya Putnam Memorial Championship Tournament at the Gilpin County Ball Field. In spite of the weather, in spite of being in pain, Vince was happy. They were there. They were alive. They were standing and walking and doing something that was part of their life.
The other part, the near death part, the complications from their stem cell transplant were behind him.
They welcomed the rain and being back on the field.
On Monday morning, Vince and Diane their wife talked about the nightmare they went through for the past year fighting their bone marrow cancer. Vince has always prided themselves on being fit and participating in challenging activities; such as, riding a bike across country with their son. To be unable to walk across a room was the hardest pill to swallow.
Vince came to Gilpin County when Ohio Bell transferred them to Mountain Bell, a move they relished.
“The mountains were like a magnet to me, they sucked me in,” says Vince. It was 1978, their children were two years and six months old.
Their employer became US West, then Quest, then Century Link. For 34 years they were the phone guy in the mountains. Vince knew just about everyone and could be there to answer a call for help.
“It was great. They let me take the truck home at night so I could be there. I took care of a lot of stuff, including working on the railroad track circuits. My first job was working in the I-70 Eisenhower Tunnel, driving a golf cart between the phone stations.”
When Vince had free time, they played softball, sometimes in Boulder, sometimes at Guercio Field in Nederland, when pick up games attracted a couple of teams and a bunch of spectators.
When they aren't playing softball, Vince was on their bike, participating in Ride the Rockies, and then their cross-country trip from Anacondas, Washington to Bar Harbor, Maine. They ran three marathons. They were fit, athletic and always ready for a challenge.
In the mid-80s, when the economy was bad, Vince thought there had to be something they could do to help and approached Chuck Webb, the president of the Nederland Bank to join them in a fund-raising challenge. Chuck would run 100 miles and Vince would bike 500 miles in one week. The goal was to raise $10k to donate to the teen center, which had not yet been built, the Optimists Club, the Food Bank, the Bucket Brigade and the Nederland seniors.
They rode from Nederland to Granby on the first day, then to Steamboat, on to Walden, Fort Collins and Littleton, to return to Nederland.
“We got a Nederland softball team together and made it to the championship seven years in a row, even won the Evergreen tournament. The Stage Stop Inn sponsored us.”
Life was good. They and Diane were enjoying doing many things, heading off to Florida each spring to watch the Rockies spring training.
Then a regular PSA test showed that Vince had prostate cancer. They went through the surgery and then radiation.
“I didn't feel that bad, I worked every day, walked every Sunday with George, didn't get mad in traffic and thanked God I was alive.”
Vince took on the challenge of a no white diet: no sugar, no flour, no potatoes, no rice, no bread and it worked. They stayed on the diet for five years, even lost the craving for sugar. The cancer went away and Vince retired, realizing that life was short and they had things they wanted to do, like the cross-country trip with their son. They wanted to spend a month in Florida, watching spring training.
Just when they were ready to take on the world in 2010, they felt their heart racing one day and learned they needed heart surgery. The surgery was repeated in 2014. During the last operation, doctors found a disorder in their blood and told them to see a hematologist. They learned that often, 10-15 years after radiation, this blood disorder, a bone marrow cancer, shows up. They were told that 64 percent of the patients need to have a bone marrow transplant.
“They told me they didn't want to do the transplant until the symptoms grew worse, that it was a risky procedure. Finally, I got sicker and weaker and the doctor said I should go for it, but I had to have a match consisting of 10 different markers. It was a 50/50 chance I would even find a match.”
It turned out that their sister was an exact match, but after seven pregnancies, they had different antigens and Vince would end up with 100 percent female DNA. The doctor told them that when the surgery was done, they would go shoe shopping a lot and would forget how to use the remote control.
Their sister flew in from Maryland. Before the surgery, the doctors found a bug in Vince's system that they had to get rid of. The bug comes from cats and is usually not a problem, but if the immune system is killed, it would be. The transplant was delayed for two weeks.
“I didn't know the odds of the transplant working and I didn't want to know. I didn't want to know how bad it was. I just wanted it done.”
Vince received eight days of chemo to bring their immune system to nothing to prepare the new stem cells to create a new immune system.
After a day of rest, the stem cells from their sister were pulled from their blood and given to Vince intravenously. Then they waited and watched the numbers rise as the cells did their job. The treatment left Vince with a mouth of sores, with thrush, with so much mucous it had to be suctioned out so they could breathe. Even a drop of water caused excruciating pain.
Diane describes what was happening as a group of workers has been not doing their job, so a new batch of workers is brought in and told to roll up their sleeves and get to work. Vince's new cells were all working, even if they were all women.
Vince was in the hospital for 34 days, in isolation and then moved to an apartment five blocks from the hospital, where they were kept in a sterile atmosphere for the next three months. Each day there were 50 things to do to keep the apartment sterile.
“These were hard times,” says Diane. “He couldn't eat. They shed skin over their whole body and lost hair.”
Vince says they just kept hanging in, day by day, doing what they had to do.
In April of 2016, they were allowed to go home, but had to report to the hospital four times a week.
They were beginning to feel better, began walking, thinking they were out of the woods, when their system decided it didn't like their liver. They went into Stage 4 liver failure.
“This was scarier than all the rest of it,” says Diane. “He was losing a pound a day and getting weaker and weaker.”
Vince's muscles began to fail him. They couldn't get up. The high doses of prednisone were attacking their muscles. Soon they couldn't get up. They remember one night they were walking from the bathroom to their recliner when they collapsed and they laid there, crying, thinking, “This is it.”
Diane wanted to help them get up, but they said “no.” After struggling for a while, they managed to get up.
“That seemed to be a turning point. I slowly began to get better. The doctor told me they didn't know how long it would take for my nerves to come back again.”
It still wasn't over. The medicine they were taking induced diabetes and they began extreme stomach disorders. They would get better for a while and then get worse. They ate mostly soup. They would go to a restaurant and take a bite and couldn't eat any more. “I just couldn't eat. I didn't have any saliva. The pain in my stomach was a 10, like a knife twisting in my gut.”
One night, Vince woke up in extreme pain and couldn't find their medication and began crawling up the stairs to get Diane. They were returned to the hospital where it was determined they had an e coli infection from the port they had. They were put back in the hospital.
This was in October of last year, since then, they have been getting better all the time. They return for once a month blood work. The doctors are keeping an eye on their liver, but their cancer in undetectable.
They have had eight bone marrow biopsies, which Vince says aren't that bad, but Diane says they are painful to watch.
It has a a year of recovery for Vince. They walked the Boulder-Boulder, a major feat, even though they had run the race a dozen times before.
One of their nurses wanted to write a story on him, saying that people not even as sick as they have been had given up. Vince says it is a matter of good luck and a lot of great care.
Vince says that during their liver failure, the doctors would assure them that they could fix it. When they began to recover they told them that they had been in a bad way. Friends visiting from Ohio said they went back to their hotel and cried, thinking they'd never see them again. At one point in the hospital, Vince stopped breathing, but came out of it on their own, thinking of the nurse who was working on him, what a beautiful lady.
“There is no way I would have made it without Diane. They took care of me, kept track of all my medications, of all my appointments and I followed them around like a puppy. St Luke's Presbyterian of Denver took care of me even though I was Catholic.”
Vince's friends did a lot for him, shoveling, babysitting him, anything they needed.
It was mandatory that Vince have 24-hour care. Throughout it all, Vince just kept putting one foot in front of the other. Now, they say, they have reached the point where they are able to plan things together. They are in a good place, every day is a gift.
When Vince reached the turning place on Jan. 11, they declared it their new birthday, they were a new person. They flew to Las Vegas to celebrate.
“Doctor has told me it is time for you to think not about surviving, but about living again. Do the things you want to do.”
Vince has to start all over again with their immune system, has to get all of the childhood disease shots like polio and measles.
The doctors told Vince that if they hadn't gone to therapy, if they hadn't done the work they did, they would be in a wheelchair today.  They are gaining weight and even is growing muscle again. Their legs are beginning to show definition.
“We are starting to get back to normal. I am doing a little bit of work at the town hall, the town shop and for Accounting Specialists. They have been contracted by a National Park in Alaska to get some wiring done. Next spring, they will go watch the Rockies practice for two months.
Another goal of theirs is to repeat the cross-country bike trip, this time taking a car, revisiting some of the places they didn't have a chance to spend much time the first time around.
Vince will attend their 50th high school reunion, and they are planning to go to Casper to watch the eclipse of the sun.
Diane says, “Everybody's got Something, people are going through all of this every day. Vince still gets tired but he's feeling better all the time. One of the really good things is that food is starting to taste better.”
Things are getting back to normal. This past year has become a memory and the Suich's have the rest of the summer to do all the things they enjoy, which have become even more precious to both of them, as they look at life from the other side.

LOS ANGELES (KGTV) - The Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, responded to today's shooting in Virginia by saying it ''underscores the urgency of ending the epidemic of gun violence in America.''
``My thoughts and prayers are with the civilians and officers wounded in today's shooting in Alexandria,'' Garcetti said in a statement.
``The senselessness of this burst of violence is only compounded by the fact that it struck as Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others were practicing for one of Washington's great bipartisan traditions. We should be...mindful of how this tragedy underscores the urgency of ending the epidemic of gun violence in America.''

"This legislation represents historic progress for manufacturers and for all Americans," Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in response to passage of the tax reform bill, which lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. With the new bill, Timmons promised, manufacturers will "increase capital spending, expand their businesses and hire more workers…" -- and "nearly half will increase employee wages and benefits."
Tax reform is just one of a series of policy changes the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress are seeking that business groups have lobbied for in recent years. The president has already started to push back against regulations.  They are advocating a $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment which will begin to address America's aging roads, bridges and other transportation avenues. And they are calling for more "reciprocal" trade agreements that seek not simply to expand trade but to make trade more equitable.
“Any time you move work you always revisit the level of automation and how to improve it, so I think more automation is coming.” – Willy Shih, Harvard Business School
Given the direction of policy and a strengthening global economy, it's not surprising that manufacturers' optimism has soared. In the NAM Manufacturers' Outlook Survey Fourth Quarter 2017, 94.6% of respondents said they were optimistic about their own company's prospects and a solid majority (58.7%) said the U.S. was headed in the right direction. With these changes, is the long-sought U.S. manufacturing renaissance about to blossom? Manufacturing experts IndustryWeek interviewed say we're not quite there yet.
"There is reason for optimism but by no means are we back to what anybody would call an historic norm for manufacturing growth," said Cliff Waldman, chief economist at the MAPI Foundation. Between 2013 and 2016, they noted, the manufacturing sector was "almost stagnant" at about 0.5% growth on average. In 2017, it grew to 1.3%. But Waldman noted that even during the 2000s, not a great period for U.S. manufacturing, "we were seeing 2.5%, 3% at times." So far, they say, it is "a very modest improvement."
For 2018, Waldman is forecasting that manufacturing will "plod forward" at 1.5% to 2.0% growth. That's not to say they don't see good signs for the sector, one of which is a recent uptick in capital spending. Waldman said the U.S. has suffered for years from weak productivity growth and an underlying cause of that was the failure to invest in new technology and machinery.
"Capital spending is the way that productivity-generating innovation is spread throughout the supply chain," Waldman said.
Tax reform means that there will be less reason to move manufacturing offshore, says Willy Shih, a manufacturing expert and professor at Harvard Business School. They believe lowered tax rates will have "a bigger impact than a lot of people realize," but they caution that decisions to build new plants in the U.S. or reshore operations won't materialize overnight. Shih also said that a decision to bring more manufacturing here does not equate to returning manufacturing sites to their former state.
Manufacturing leaders also support
the Trump administration's promise
to take on infrastructure. In theirs
SOTU speech, Trump called for
a $1.5 trillion effort to “build
gleaming new roads, bridges,
highways, railways, and waterways across our land"
"Any time you move work you always revisit the level of automation and how to improve it, so I think more automation is coming," said Shih. They pointed to a variety of technologies such as simulation software and machine learning that will help companies improve the efficiency of their operations and help the move toward mass customization. At the heart of much of Industry 4.0, they said, is the move away from build-to-stock and toward build-to-order.
Better information and analytics will continue to fuel the reshaping of manufacturing, says Nick Foy, chief strategy officer at ModusLink, a provider of supply chain and logistics services. "Big data will be a driving factor throughout the year, driven by an expansion outside of the retail market which allows for more collaboration across the supply chain. Big data will have the most impact on B2B sales, which will allow it to reach further into the supply chain towards raw materials suppliers and intermediaries, ultimately allowing for faster movement of information, leading to better decision making."
Like Shih, Foy also expects manufacturers to deal with decreasing order sizes. "This continued shrinking of order sizes will allow brands to reduce inventory of finished goods, a move led by the increased prominence of postponement and near-shoring, though it will likely have the opposite 'bullwhip effect' on inventory of raw materials."
Coming Home?
Recent moves on taxes and regulation may start a pickup in reshoring, but the business and government leaders will have to overcome decades of uncertainty about manufacturing's role in America.
"The truth is, the ingredients have been in place for several years, and we still haven't seen the promised renaissance in American manufacturing," says Josh Green, co-founder and CEO of Panjiva, a big data company that analyzes global supply chains. "What's missing? Conviction on the part of executives making buying decisions that America will be a center of manufacturing in the decades to come -- and is therefore a country where they should focus their attention. Generating this kind of conviction will require a clearer definition of the specific types of manufacturing where America has a unique and enduring advantage relative to other countries around the world, as well as sustained private and public investments in the people, places, and companies that are involved in these types of manufacturing."
Manufacturers are exploring their options on manufacturing location and supply chain structures as uncertainty about trade policies rises, says Jeff McKinney, a managing director at Accenture Strategy. One issue they are examining is finding ways to bring back production to the U.S. and take advantage of consumers' preference for Made-in-America products while still keeping costs in line. They said companies are looking at a "segmented" approach to this. Rather than bring all their production to the U.S., they will bring specific products. So an apparel manufacturer, for example, may bring its high-end lines to the U.S. but continue to make clothing basics overseas.
McKinney noted that the labor cost differential between Mexico and the U.S. is still substantial. They said for a production worker in the U.S., the average labor charge is $26 to $28 an hour versus $4 to $6 in Mexico. In order to make a move to the U.S., they said, two significant cost factors to consider are the facility's footprint and automation. They said facilities can be smaller because of improved automation. A smaller factory also results in reducing labor costs and other costs such as MRO.
As for automation, McKinney says Accenture considers a dozen technologies when working with clients to determine the feasibility of reshoring. They may include mobility technology to enable a more real-time view of operations, analytics to keep machines running more effectively or advanced packaging machinery. At this point, they say, automation is not resulting in the "wholesale replacement of headcount" but is being applied tactically to "pockets" in a factory. For example, a Midwest manufacturer they work with has put in automated cells for a production process that had been conducted manually and required five to six people. Now those cells can be operated by one person.
After visiting six manufacturing plants in Illinois and the Carolinas the week we spoke to him, Jeff Owens, the CEO of Advanced Technology Services (ATS), said they found "a real energy that's building in manufacturing." But Owens said the "good problem" facing manufacturers is finding people to staff their plants after years of little or no hiring. Even as manufacturing employment increased by 196,000 in 2017, the industry faces massive dislocation as baby boomers retire and manufacturers compete with other industries for tech-savvy recruits.
ATS is not immune to this need for people. Owens said the company has been working for several years on the "people side of maintenance" through conducting "robust" recruiting, pursuing former military personnel and establishing "a lot of technical training."
ATS has also found a business opportunity in this tightening labor market. While most of its business involves long-term contracts, the company established in 2015 eFactory Services to help manufacturers who need short-term help. ATS helps with a variety of issues such as preventive/predictive maintenance services, repairable parts management, critical spares planning, supplemental maintenance and even consulting on continuous improvement projects. "Maybe it's a little more expensive, but there's no long-term commitment and people really like that," Owens observed.
More to Do
If business groups such as NAM and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are celebrating victories on taxes and regulations, they also insist that more must be done to help their members. Trade may be the area where there is the most uncertainty and disagreement with the Trump administration.
"As the administration has pulled back on trade agreements, governments around the world have rushed forward to fill the void. The EU is striking major deals with Canada, Japan and Mexico. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership is now moving forward without U.S. involvement," U.S. Chamber President Tom Donohue noted in their 2018 State of American Business address. "This is a reminder that we are in a global competition to sell to the 95% of the world's population that lives outside of the U.S. -- and that competition goes on with or without us."
While agreeing with the push to modernize NAFTA, Donohue warned that "withdrawing from NAFTA would be a grave mistake."
Harvard's Shih points out that in the automotive sector, domestic manufacturers have moved away from vertical integration to complex supply chains with specialized suppliers. Parts move freely across the U.S. borders from Canada and Mexico. If NAFTA negotiations result in barriers to the flow of those parts, they warn, "all of a sudden you're going to cause chaos in the supply chain."
Even more challenging will be how the Trump administration handles China. Trade with China in 2017 accounted for 53% of the U.S. trade deficit, according to the latest government figure. U.S. companies still benefit from lower manufacturing costs in China, thought that differential is narrowing. And American consumers pay less for goods produced there. But trade hawks such as Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, say the U.S. has paid a huge price in American jobs for this unequal trade and the administration needs to act, not just complain about Chinese practices.
"China has yet to make a meaningful concession on its state-led mercantilism, despite two meetings between presidents Trump and Xi," Paul said after the State of the Union address. "This speech won't change China's behavior and defend American jobs. Only action will. It's time for the president's policies and actions to match their talk."
Manufacturing leaders also support the Trump administration's promise to take on infrastructure. In their SOTU speech, Trump called for a $1.5 trillion effort to "build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land."
AEM President Dennis Slater, who represents more than 950 manufacturers of construction, agricultural and other equipment, applauds the call for action on infrastructure. However, they said their members "want details from President Trump about their infrastructure plan, and when our industry can expect legislation to make that plan a reality."
Indeed, the details of trade deals, infrastructure, workforce training and other challenges for manufacturing lie ahead. But while the Trump team may have low marks from the U.S. electorate as a whole, many manufacturing leaders believe the president is on their side and hope they fulfill their promise to have companies and jobs "coming back."
About 2,000 students from all over the country - Jews, Arabs, Bedouins and Druze - participated in archaeological excavations in Hokuk in the Lower Galilee in recent months.
The students uncovered an ancient industrial area where facilities were hewn in the bedrock and used to process agricultural products.
British-born, New York raised-and-based music producer Karsh Kale says there is no software that can come close to replacing the chemistry between musicians when they come together to create music.
“The years have proven one thing to me — that there is no software, controllers, loopers, or other gear on this planet that can come close to replacing the chemistry that happens when musicians come together to make music,” Kale, who has roots in India, said in a statement.
“The ideas always remain human. I think young artistes need to be less concerned with what gear they are using and more about gaining more human experience,” they added.
Kale features in a new episode of Red Bull Music Academy's “Studio Science” which looks inside the laboratories of some of the creative minds, offering tips and tricks for aspiring musicians.
The series has featured musicians like Disclosure, Four Tet and Suzanne Ciani.
Now, “Studio Science” turns its attention to the tabla star and celebrated multi-instrumentalist Kale, in the episode shot in India.
The episode premieres on Red Bull Music Academy's YouTube channel on Wednesday, and features them alongside the Karsh Kale Collective.
“I love the idea of bringing people into the intimate details of our unique studio approaches and set-ups. Each artiste figures their own way to navigate the infinite possibilities of the studio and Red Bull Music Academy's ‘Studio Science' is a great platform to open that door for aspiring artistes and producers,” said Kale.
The collective includes guitarist Warren Mendonsa, flute player Ajay Prasanna, Jai Row Kavi on drums, Karan Deshmukh on percussions, Apeksha Dandekar on vocals, Nathan Thomas on bass and Delhi-based live act Shadow & Light (Anindo and Pavithra).

USA Hockey will not replace Jim Johannson as general manager after they died unexpectedly at their home at age 53 on the eve of the Olympics.
Executive director Pat Kelleher says "there will only be one general manager" of the team after Johannson selected the coaching staff and 25-man roster for the first U.S. Olympic men's hockey team without NHL players since 1994. Kelleher says director of player personnel Ben Smith will fill Johannson's duties in South Korea.
Johannson was in the midst of their most high-profile role in their 17 years at USA Hockey when they died Jan. 21, less than three weeks after the roster was announced. They have been responsible for many world junior and world championship teams in the past several years.

SpaceX's next Falcon 9 rocket rolled out of its hangar and up the ramp to Kennedy Space Center's launch pad 39A Sunday in preparation for liftoff on a two-day trek ferrying more than 6,400 pounds of supplies and experiments to the International Space Station.
Workers at the launch pad spent Sunday afternoon installing last-minute cargo into the pressurized cabin of SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft mounted to the end of the rocket. The “late load” items included a habitat with 20 research mice, and a host of biological experiments, freezers and fresh food.
Liftoff is set for 12:31 p.m. EDT (1631 GMT) Monday, with arrival at the space station scheduled for Wednesday.
The robotic resupply run will mark the 39th launch of a Falcon 9 rocket, and the 11th SpaceX launch this year. SpaceX intends to recover the rocket's first stage with a propulsive vertical landing at nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station a few minutes after liftoff, aiming to land a rocket intact for the 14th time.
The Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket flying Monday are newly-manufactured, except for the landing legs at the base of the first stage, which were previously flown.

ISLAMABAD (AP) — A strong magnitude 6.1 earthquake rattled Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the capital cities of both countries, on Wednesday, killing a young girl and injuring five others, officials said.
The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake's center was in northeast Afghanistan near the Pakistan border, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Jarm in the Hindu Kush region, with a depth of 191.2 kilometers (119 miles).
TV footage showed Pakistanis fleeing offices schools in panic in Islamabad and elsewhere in the country.
At least one girl was killed and five others injured when roofs collapsed on mud-brick homes in the village of Lasbela in Pakistan's Baluchistan province, said local government official Izat Nazir Baluch. They said authorities were still trying to assess damages in Baluchistan.
The quake was felt in the Afghan capital Kabul and the Pakistan capital Islamabad. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries in Afghanistan.
The earthquake also was felt in the Indian capital New Delhi and the Indian Kashmir region. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage to buildings there.
A magnitude-7.6 quake in 2005 killed thousands of people in Pakistan and Kashmir.

The Knicks beat the Hawks on Sunday night at Madison Square Garden, which is far from newsworthy considering the Hawks are among the NBA's worst teams and New York has been surprisingly competent through a quarter of the season.
However, there was one performance that stood out above the rest on Sunday night. It wasn't Kristap Porzingis with 30 points or Doug McDermott with 23 off the bench, but that of Michael Beasley. The reserve small forward managed to pull off an impressive feat, fouling out in only 10 minutes of play (or nine, depending on the source and the rounding).
Beasley's stat line read 0 points (0-of-3 shooting), two rebounds, 0 assists, one turnover, 0 blocks, 0 steals, six fouls. The best part of Beasley's short evening of action was that they managed to be a +11 in those 10 minutes on the floor. There were many wondering if Beasley's feat of fouling out so quickly was some sort of record. It was not. In fact, he's the 189th player in NBA history to commit six fouls in 10 minutes or fewer played, according to Basketball-Reference.
Last year it happened twice, when Jason Smith fouled out in eight minutes for Washington and Salah Mejri fouled out in six minutes for Dallas. Six minutes is also the Knicks record for quickest foul out, accomplished by Len Elmore in 1984. In the last 10 seasons (so, since 2008-09) 24 players aside from Beasley have pulled off the feat (on 28 different occasions), with quite the list of names.
Guest column: free speech is essential to American liberty
In the wake of protests in Berkeley, California, and the ensuing support for silencing speakers deemed upsetting by the left, we all should step back and reflect upon the idea that has made our society truly and classically liberal.
Free speech is more than a mere law; it is a defining principle of our society. It is not merely one among many competing values. Properly understood, it is a foundational value that supports all else that is good in our culture.
We hold this truth to be self-evident: that free expression, the foundation of a liberty-loving society, is granted to us by our creator and cannot be justly restricted by the institutions of man.
Free speech and government
Those who believe government grants us our rights fail to comprehend this essential feature of the American tradition. If government grants us free expression, then it has the ability to constrict it by requiring that it be exercised in the proper place with proper consent.
I do not hold to that idea and neither should you.
The moment we give individuals the authority to decide where and when you can express your views, we relinquish the power to freely dissent. Being at liberty to do so is not merely a concoction to benefit the few; it protects us all no matter our race, religion or ideology. It provides universal benefit, and we must never lose sight of that basic truth.
In their immortal treatise On Liberty, John Stuart Mill described the virtues of free expression.
They said: “He who knows only their own side of the case knows little of that.” And further, “The particular evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it is robbing the human race…those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.”
Even if a suppressed opinion may be erroneous, it often contains a kernel of truth. Since no view is ever perfectly formed, by the battle of wits we elucidate the unknown. This argument is not about law, but rather a personal responsibility to engage with those whom we disagree.
Any restriction on the expression of an opinion reduces the total knowledge of humanity and immorally robs from history the conclusions of our frank and honest debates.
Constraining free speech
The problem with confronting free speech with forceful demands that it be stopped is not that it runs counter to law — the Constitution constrains only the government from such action, not individuals. The problem is that those actions trample the principle of liberty that a pluralistic society must cherish.
Rather than shout down speakers, we should hear them out (or not — you're not required to listen) and then counter speech we find disagreeable with our own. If you truly believe your views are correct and important then you should use every opportunity to persuade others rather than banish dissent.
Shutting down discussion is merely a self-gratifying exercise rather than one of academic courage. The corollary to this notion is that any restriction on the locations where free expression can be conducted similarly constricts the voices of those who wish to be heard.
The only difference is that, where speech is restricted to designated places, the coercive force is exerted by administrators and police rather than by a mob. Free Speech Zones are, therefore, an aberration which have no place in a university setting.
Rather than talk about what areas of campus should be Free Speech Zones, an understanding of the rationale and importance of free speech should cause us to flip the argument around. Instead of designating a few areas as places where we allow the exercise of liberty, we should consider all campus to be a place of free expression barring only the few requirements necessary for the functioning of the University.
For example, it would not be possible for a professor to teach if people were to protest inside their classroom.
By looking at the entire campus as a Free Speech Zone as the starting point, and only then limiting the few necessities, we make a statement of our values: We will no longer aspire to the bare minimum of the law but rather to the maximum of our principles.
In a commitment to free expression, universities nationwide should be fostering speech in all forms, at all times, and everywhere that does not diminish the ability of the school to perform its functions.
I urge our beloved University to similarly codify its own commitment to fostering dialogue, free expression and open inquiry by all students, faculty, staff and guests. The University of Chicago described the importance of and its commitment to this value in its “Statement on Principles of Free Expression.”
It is high time we make a similar pledge.
In Whitney v. California, Justice Louis Brandeis said: “If there be a time to expose through discussion the falsehoods and fallacies, to avert the evil by the process of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.”

Five young women elected to spend their free time with Microsoft associates at Christiana Mall to learn how to run their own business.
Their experience paidoff as they compete at Junior Achievement USA's National Student Leadership Summit this month in Washington, D.C.
The teens came together, all from different high schools, to participate in the nearly 100-year-old JA Company Program, which has been revamped for 21st Century learners. In The NEW JA Company Program offers online, web-based content that replaced paper and pencil ledgers of days gone by. The corporate structure of JA companies now uses the Lean Start-Up Methodology approach.
The team, like many of their millennial peers, seek to “do good,” in the community as they positively impact the bottom line of their JA Company, Dare2BU (D2BU). According to the D2BU annual report they “founded and managed a social awareness company that promotes positivity, self-love, and diversity.”

Their social awareness brand, which was marketed through Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, resulted in the sale of 65 custom t-shirts emblazoned with D2BU. The icon and conversation starter is donned by customers who want to make a statement of positivity, diversity and being comfortable in one's skin, a JA release stated.
The students each led different functions of the company, but all pitched in wherever and whenever necessary. Brianna took on the role of President, Jabreya was in charge of Supply Chain, Victoria headed Marketing, Sierra led Sales, and Kelly was in charge of Finance.
The company was “bootstrap-funded,” with $276.50 from spare change brought in from all five team members, as well as, $49 in donations from friends and family.
Upon liquidation, all five were reimbursed their initial investment, while withholding their profit share until the final company meeting, where decisions will be made about how to distribute the $529.30 in profit.
The money can be used to pay a dividend to the teammates and friends/family, can be invested in a new JA Company Program to continue the social awareness brand next school year, and/or it can be donated to a charitable cause.
Christiana Mall Microsoft Store Community Development Specialist Nick Christine enjoys partnering with Junior Achievement on the JA Company Program and JA Job Shadow.
Christine says, “We are so proud of…these young women and all they have accomplished.”
Junior Achievement of Delaware president Rob Eppes, an award-winning JA Company PProgram alumfrom Newark High School), says reconnecting JA Companies to the mall environment brings back terrific memories of trade fairs where high schoolers in JA would peddle their wares.
“It was a highly competitive situation, not only between the JA Companies, but also among individual sales people in each company, to see who could sell the most product,” recalls Eppes. “But it was also a lot of fun!”
The Christiana Mall Management team met with Eppes and JA's Student Enterprise Manager Ryan Venderlic to approve the project and discuss ways to promote the opportunity to other mall stores and children of mall employees.
In addition to competing at the JA National Student Leadership Summit, D2BU has been selected as a model social enterprise to be featured on the learning platform as an example for thousands of other would-be teen entrepreneurs who will participate in The New JA Company Program over the next several years
And then, Republicans pulled a maneuver of their own: setting aside the entire list of bills that were to be voted on.
“The calendar has been laid aside for the day,” said Senator Joseph A. Griffo, the Republican who presided over the chamber's proceedings.
“What just happened?” a Democratic aide wondered aloud on the floor of the Senate chamber.
It was, all in all, another dysfunctional day in the State Capitol, where the Legislature appears poised to wrap up its three remaining weeks of session with a whimper — a fact acknowledged even by the legislators themselves, some of whom have begun discussing whether to just end the whole thing early to save taxpayers' money.
“My colleagues across the aisle understood that we have an opportunity to actually pass” the bills, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Democratic minority leader, said to reporters at day's end. “And rather than have to face the vote, they decided to end the session.”
But when asked if the Democrats would try the same maneuver every day for the rest of session, Ms. Stewart-Cousins demurred, saying they planned to push every day for “things that are important.”
The Democrats' seeming perpetual obstacle to a majority remains Mr. Felder, a Democrat of Brooklyn, who has always sat and voted with Republicans, giving that party leadership in the chamber. (Last week, members of the Democratic Party's executive committee voted — nonbindingly — to expel Mr. Felder, who joked that the Democrats might “build a wall” to keep them out of the party.)
That already strange power structure was given an additional twist by Mr. Croci, whose exact whereabouts remain shrouded in semi-secrecy. Asked to clarify the senator's exact geographic coordinates, their spokesperson, Christine Geed, said on Tuesday they were “in the States,” presumably meaning dry land somewhere.
Atiku to Unveil Agenda for Nigeria Wednesday
Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will on Wednesday in London unveil their plans to unlock “the immeasurable potentials of Nigeria” for the benefit of the people.
Scheduled to give an economic speech at the London Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), United Kingdom, they will dwell on delivering jobs, prosperity, security, among other concerns of the citizens.
According to a statement issued by their media office in Abuja on Monday, the presidential aspirant's keynote speech entitled “The Importance of Strengthening State Economic Management Systems” will lay bare novel and real prescriptions that when implemented will help Nigerian states come out from their economic quagmire and ultimately gets Nigeria working again.
The statement revealed that Chatham keynote speech is one in a series of engagements by the PDP presidential hopeful to showcase the possibilities that exist in Nigeria and how to unlock its huge potentials to the good of all Nigerians.
According to a statement, Atiku will also deliver another major keynote speech at the Invest Africa and British Council for Africa “Annual Debate.”
The former Vice President will be speaking alongside Dr Liam Fox, International Trade Secretary of the United Kingdom Government, on the subject of “Building new trade partnerships in Africa”
The statement added: “These engagements are a follow-up to Atiku Abubakar's meeting in June of 2017 with Liam Fox and Prime Minister Theresa May where they discussed the UK's plan for increased trade with Nigeria post-Brexit.”
The PDP presidential hopeful will also be the guest of honour at a lunch on Nigerian inward investment to be hosted by Lord Anthony St John (former UK Minister for Africa) and be a guest speaker at Round Table of key UK business leaders keen in investing in Nigeria at the Institute of Directors, Pall Mall.
“The visit to the UK by Atiku Abubakar, one of Nigeria's most successful business leaders and foremost advocates for restructuring and free trade, is a continuation of their life-long commitment to finding real solutions to help rescue Nigeria from its current economic crisis and set it on the path of economic growth and prosperity,” the statement added.

Connecticut Better Business Bureau urges consumers and businesses to begin digital spring cleaning. The safety of your personal and financial information can be stolen by hackers.
Identity theft is one of consumers' leading concerns, with good reason. Recovering from ID theft can be a long, complex and potentially costly ordeal, something to consider this Saturday, which is Secure Your ID Day.
You may have unknowingly downloaded free software or gone on a site that slips a virus into your computer. They can steal your contacts, learn all of your logins and passwords and discover your bank's, doctor's or dentist's contact information, which can help them to get you to reveal personal information by telephone or email.
Connecticut Better Business Bureau spokesperson Howard Schwartz says we can lose all of our files, even if our computers are clean of malware.
“Hard drives have a limited lifespan and can suddenly corrupt your files. A mechanical problem such a crash may ruin your storage disk, and if you lose or drop your laptop or it is lost or stolen, all of your cherished photos, videos, emails and documents will be gone.”
BBB tips for digital spring cleaning
Keep software up to date — Those patches and updates often close security vulnerabilities. Install/apply operating system and software patches as soon as possible.
Back up your files — Storage drives are inexpensive and in a few minutes you will have copies of all of your files and other media so that if you get hacked, or if your computer is lost or stolen, you will still have those files.
Secure smart devices — Your smartphone, tablet and all digital storage devices should be protected by a password and contain tracking software to enable you to find a lost or stolen device.
Lock the “digital doors” with software — Antivirus software is of little use if you don't keep it updated and scan your device weekly for malware. If you don't use your computer often, update and scan before you go online.
Fix your passwords — Millions of passwords and logins have been stolen in data breaches, and victims of computer-based fraud often admit they use the same password for multiple accounts, or a password that is easy to guess. Often, information contained in people's passwords are taken from social media profiles, such as pet names or the names of family members.
Experts recommend a combination of upper and lower case letters, numerals and a symbol. Free password management software is available online. It can generate strong passwords, store them and log you in to your favorite sites automatically.

What would you recommend? I want to add some weight to it but not too much and stay 7RM. I haven't had one re-barreled before can I do this for under $600? Site recommendations?
I'm sure there are similar sites but check out Pac-Nor, they can fit and chamber their barrel to your action for $300 (includes lapping and truing of action) + $275 - $325 for barrel ( Price List - Caliber and Twist Rate Chart - PAC-NOR Barreling, Inc. - Precision Rifle Barrels - Pac-Nor.com ).
You can use their ( Barrel Weight Calculator - PAC-NOR Barreling, Inc. - Precision Rifle Barrels - Pac-Nor.com ) to figure out what contour best fit your target weight.

I support Vicki Tesoro for first selectman because they are a tireless advocate for the young people of our community.  They are a founding member and current co-chair of TPAUD, and founder of the Trumbull High School Ninth Grade Underage Drinking and Drug Forum.
Vicki has done more to support prevention efforts against alcohol and drug abuse in Trumbull than anyone I know, and they will continue that same work along with their team when elected.
Regardless of political party, there is one thing we can all agree on: we do not want our children impacted by the current drug epidemic. As a Trumbull resident and parent of school-age children, prevention is one of my hot button issues. I was fortunate to find a place at the table at the Trumbull Partnership Against Underage Drinking and Drugs (TPAUD) meetings. These meetings are where I got know Vicki and the scope of their work.
If you aren't familiar with TPAUD, it is a community-based prevention coalition awarded more than $1 million in state and federal grants since it started 11 years ago. You might be familiar with the anonymous underage drinking TipsLine and the prescription drug drop box at the Trumbull Police headquarters, which are two of the many programs supported by TPAUD.
If you haven't attended a meeting, it's an excellent opportunity to see stakeholders from many agencies and town departments as they come together, with one goal: keeping our youth safe, drug and alcohol-free and alive.
Vicki came up with the idea for the Ninth Grade Underage Drinking and Drug Forum when their daughter started high school. They saw a need for a program, and started one. Twelve years later, it is as relevant now as when it started.
The educational program attended by ninth graders and their parents features speakers including Emergency Room physicians, attorneys, police officers and recovering alcoholics and addicts. It's simultaneously shocking, sad and inspiring. The hope is that by arming parents with information and support for dealing with drinking and drug use by our children, we can reduce the possibility of more devastation in Trumbull.
Vicki and their team are committed to reducing the impact of substance abuse and addiction in our community, and will not seek any additional funding from the town for these programs.
Vicki's experience in local government, commitment to the youth of our community, and ability to collaborate, make them the best choice as first selectman.
Please join me in voting for Vicki Tesoro on November 7.
To help tell the story of how high performance computing is enabling truly "out of this world" discoveries, SC17 (the world's largest supercomputing conference) has released a brief video that focuses on the role of high performance computers in the 2017 Nobel Prize winning LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) collaboration. The just announced prize was awarded for the discovery of gravitational waves, originally theorized 100 years ago by Albert Einstein in their general theory of relativity.
LIGO, funded by the National Science Foundation, uses incredibly sophisticated geographically-distributed laser detectors to find the elusive sounds in the universe that prove the existence of gravitational waves.
"We are only now beginning to hear the vibrations of space-time that are all around us-we just needed a better ear. And when we detect that, we're detecting the vibrations of everything that has ever moved in the universe. This is real. This is really there, and we've never noticed it until now," said Alan Weinstein Head, Caltech LIGO Laboratory Astrophysics Group and Professor of Physics, Caltech.
About SC17:
SC17 is the premier international conference showcasing the many ways high performance computing, networking, storage and analysis leads to advances in scientific discovery, research, education and commerce. The annual event, created and sponsored by ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and the IEEE Computer Society, attracts HPC professionals and educators from around the globe to participate in its complete technical education program, workshops, a world-class exhibit area, demonstrations and opportunities for hands-on learning. SC17 takes place in Denver, Colorado, from Nov. 12-17, 2017.
HONOLULU (AP) — The missile alert mistakenly sent on Jan. 13 by Hawaii officials came just a few minutes after a shift change at state Emergency Operations Center in Diamond Head Crater.
Here's a timeline of what happened:
8:05 a.m. — The midnight shift supervisor started a no-notice ballistic missile defense drill at shift change. In a phone call, the supervisor pretended to be U.S. Pacific Command to initiate the drill. The supervisor said ahead of and after the drill, "Exercise, exercise, exercise." However, it also contained the language, "This is not a drill." The day shift warning officers received the message on a speaker phone. The FCC says while the other officers understood this to be a drill, the person at the alert origination terminal "claimed to believe, in a written statement" that this was a real emergency and not a drill. The officer responds, as trained, by sending a live incoming missile alert.
8:07 a.m. — The state emergency agency employee selects the template for a live alert from a drop-down menu, and clicks 'yes' in response to a prompt that reads, 'Are you sure that you want to send this Alert?'
8:08 a.m. — The head of the Emergency Management Agency, state adjutant general Maj. Gen. Joe Logan, speaks to the warning center and is notified of false alert.
8:09 a.m. — Logan calls and informs Gov. David Ige. Agency notifies counties there's no missile threat.
8:10 a.m. — Logan confirms with U.S. Pacific Command that there was no missile launch. Honolulu police are notified of the false alarm.
8:12 a.m. — The state issues a cancellation that prevents the message from being sent to phones that hadn't previously received it, such as those out of cellphone coverage range or had been turned off.
8:13 a.m. — Officials begin outreach, but phone lines become congested.
8:19 a.m. — If there had been a real missile, this is about when it would have hit the islands. It is estimated that a missile would take about 20 minutes to reach Hawaii from North Korea. Officials say it would take about five minutes for the military to analyze the launch trajectory and notify the state, leaving only 12 to 15 minutes of warning time before impact.
8:20 a.m. — Officials post to Facebook, Twitter accounts that there is no missile threat.
8:24 a.m. — Gov. David Ige retweets the cancellation notice.
8:27 a.m. — Officials determine that a Civil Emergency Message is the best way to correct this message, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency confirms three minutes later.
8:30 a.m. — Federal Emergency Management Agency officials say they received a call from Hawaii seeking guidance on sending correction of alert. State officials say the call was about a minute long. Ige posts cancellation notice on their Facebook page.
8:31 a.m. — An emergency management supervisor logs into alert system to start crafting false alert correction.
8:45 a.m. — Cancellation of warning sent to cellphones: "There is no missile threat or danger to the State of Hawaii. Repeat. False Alarm." The state said it issued the cancellation after getting authorization from FEMA. However, FEMA said its approval was not required.

COSTA MESA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Chargers brought in the team's biggest target in free agency this week, agreeing to terms on a two-year deal with former Miami Dolphins center Mike Pouncey, the team announced on Monday.
A source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter that the deal is worth $15 million, including $10 million fully guaranteed.
Released by the Dolphins last week because they refused to take a pay cut, the 28-year-old Pouncey consummated a deal with the Chargers after an in-house visit on Monday.
With Pouncey signed through the 2020 season as part of a five-year contract extension with the Dolphins in 2015, Miami saved $7 million on its salary cap with their release.
A three-time Pro Bowler, Pouncey started 93 games in seven seasons with the Dolphins but played in all 16 games last season for the first time since 2012.
The Chargers could use help up front on their offensive line and have not found a long-term replacement at center since Nick Hardwick retired after the 2014 season.
Spencer Pulley started all 16 games last season in their first year as a starter, but the Vanderbilt product's performance was uneven.
With Pouncey in the fold, the Chargers have a projected starting offensive line of Russell Okung at left tackle, Dan Feeney at left guard, Pouncey at center, Forrest Lamp at right guard and Joe Barksdale at right tackle.
Known for their strength as a run-blocker, Pouncey should improve a running game that averaged 3.81 yards per carry last season, No. 26 in the NFL.
Pouncey, who was a Dolphins team captain last season, also was one of the central figures in the locker room bullying scandal involving former Dolphins offensive lineman Jonathan Martin.
NFL investigator Ted Wells' 144-page report into the incidents found that Pouncey and teammate John Jerry followed Richie Incognito's lead in bullying Martin.
Pouncey's twin brother, Maurkice, is the starting center for the Pittsburgh Steelers.
PATERSON, N.J. (CBSNewYork) — Honors Tuesday for a Paterson police officer who was killed in a car crash last week.
Family, friends and fellow officers gathered for the funeral to remember Officer Tamby Yagan. The 41-year-old traffic officer was killed early Sunday morning after they crashed their squad car while on patrol on Getty Avenue.
“It's a terrible loss for the Police Department, a terrible loss for their family,” said Paterson Police Chief Troy Oswald.
“I just mourn for them and their family.”
Yagan is being remembered by fellow cops as an officer who went above and beyond to serve their community, a kind-hearted family man and an especially loving father to their young son, whom they adored.
“Really their entire life was their son,” said Oswald.
Yagan has also been described by friends as an avid body builder, a former volunteer firefighter and most of all, a warm and generous person.
“We are here to honor them and support their family for all the things they have done for many years,” Oswald said.
Authorities say Yagan was alone behind the wheel of their patrol car when they crashed into a parked car. They were taken to a hospital where they later died.
They were the only person involved in the crash, which is under investigation. No word yet on what caused it.

DENVER (AP) - The Denver Sheriff's Department mishandled an investigation into the 2015 death of a man restrained by deputies at the jail and must change its disciplinary and investigative process, a law enforcement watchdog agency said in a blistering report Monday that focused new attention on a case that has already resulted in a $4.6 million settlement.
The report made public by Denver's independent police monitor, a civilian oversight agency for Denver's police and sheriff departments, recommends that a civilian be put in charge of the Internal Affairs Bureau of the sheriff's department that investigates allegations of officer misconduct.
It also called on the sheriff's department to make a variety of changes to its policies on staff training, hiring and interaction with medical staff when an inmate's health conflicts with jail security.
The city of Denver reached the settlement with Michael Marshall's family in November that required other changes at the jail, including mental health coverage being provided there 24 hours a day and training for all deputies on mental illness.
Marshall, 50, died nine days after they were restrained in a prone position for several minutes by Denver jail deputies because they said Marshall was aggressive with another inmate and had ignored commands. They choked on their own vomit, lost consciousness and died later at a hospital.
The report includes new detail about how the sheriff's department responded to Marshall's death and levels harsh criticism at the Internal Affairs Bureau, which began its review of the case in 2016 after prosecutors announced that no criminal charges would be filed.
About a month later, the bureau told the independent monitor's office that its investigation was complete, according to the report.
Independent Monitor Nick Mitchell's office objected, arguing that investigators did not interview any of the deputies who restrained Marshall at the jail or the nurses who were called to the area when Marshall became unconscious. The monitor's office also objected in June when investigators again declined to further investigate.
Both attempts to end the inquiry "raised troubling questions about IAB's willingness to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation of this serious case," the report says. Choosing a civilian to lead the internal affairs division could insulate it from "internal pressures," it says.
The report also questioned why several sergeants present as deputies restrained Marshall were not disciplined.
As supervisors, they should have stepped in, the report said. Deputy Bret Garegnani, Deputy Carlos Hernandez and Captain James Johnson received brief suspensions that were overturned after the officers appealed.
The report also criticizes the sheriff's department for failing to create a policy for reviewing deaths and other incidents at the jail.
The department "tried to minimize potential issues....instead of seeing it as an opportunity to learn," the report said. Garegnani was nominated for the department's "Life Saving Award" for performing CPR on Marshall, the report added.
Jess Vigil, Denver's deputy director of its safety department, defended the internal investigation and disciplinary decisions. They said concerns were raised by the watchdog group but that it ultimately found the investigation "thorough and complete."
Vigil said internal investigators mistakenly relied on results of the criminal investigation into the death initially but did end up conducting their own interviews and research.
The report said nurses told deputies that too much pressure placed on Marshall's neck could cause them to choke after vomiting but deputies refused and said they had to control Marshall.
The monitor's report recommended more training and a supervisor's input during future conflicts between jail medical staff and deputies.

NJC recall of suspended judges
Much to the expectation of many critical stakeholders in the justice sector, the National Judicial Council, NJC, at its meeting of Thursday , June1,2017, recalled six of the suspended eight judges, including two Justices of the Supreme Court. They had been suspended following allegations of corruption levelled against them.
The Department of State Security, DSS, carried out a “sting operation” on the affected judges between October 7and 9,2016, which led to their arrest and subsequent suspension from the Bench by the NJC which yielded to pressure from the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, and other quarters outside the Judiciary before it took the decision. Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, had specifically requested that the judges excuse themselves from their duties pending the outcome of investigations of allegations against them.
Charges were instituted against three of the affected judges. Eight months down the line, the Federal Government is yet to file any charges against five others. Justice Adeniyi Ademola of the Federal High Court , the only one that stood trial among the six reinstated judges was discharged and acquitted of the 18-count charge by the trial court. The Federal Government had appealed the decision. Justice Sylvester Ngwuta of the Supreme Court and Justice Rita Ofili-Ajumogobia of the Federal High Court are still on trial.
We see the NJC's decision to recall the judges after about eight months of failure to charge most of them to court as timely, an assertion of the Judiciary's independence as an arm of government. It equally amplifies the widely-held view that security and other anti-graft agencies conduct shoddy investigations in most of the corruption cases taken to the courts. Often, suspects are arrested and kept in the cooler or arraigned while investigations are still on-going. In the end prosecuting agencies lack weighty evidence to secure conviction.
That is why the Federal Government has lost many graft cases in recent times, and this is totally unacceptable because it unwittingly undercuts efforts to fight corruption.
The oft-mouthed shibboleth by the Executive that the Judiciary is a clog in the wheel of its anti-corruption crusade is no longer holding water. Without prejudice to the fact that corrupt judges in the system need to be weeded out, the court is a hallowed temple where justice, civil or criminal, is dispensed on the weight of evidence adduced . Where there is no sufficient and compelling evidence to convict an accused person before a court of competent jurisdiction, the law presumes the person innocent except a superior court decides otherwise.
The Government's interpretation of the NJC's action as a betrayal of the administration's anti graft war ignores the fact that its investigative and prosecutorial agencies flunked their assignments. After waiting in vain for eight months for the judges to be charged to court, the NJC was fully justified in recalling the judges to their duty posts to attend to cases which were abandoned while the nation waited.
We condemn the unhealthy media exchanges between the Presidency and the NJC after the recall of the judges and urge the Executive branch to work harmoniously with the Judiciary to recharge the flagging anti-graft war, including the internal cleansing of the Judiciary.
The anti-graft war is very popular with Nigerians and in the overwhelming interest of the nation. It must be supported to succeed.

Chimamanda will lead women to ‘hell'
Who made Chimamanda Adichie the supremo of feminism? Who made them the feminist papal? How did they become the feminist potentate? By asking Hilary Clinton, former US presidential candidate, why their Twitter bio starts with “wife', Chimamanda has not only intruded into the personal business of Clinton, but also scorned a key principle of feminism […]

At the center of Charlottesville's violent white nationalist rally was a long-simmering controversy over the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.
Controversies over Confederate symbols have been brewing around the country — most notably in South Carolina, where the Confederate flag was lowered from the state house grounds two years ago, and New Orleans, where statues came down earlier this year.
But in Charlottesville, the movement to remove a Lee statue and the backlash that followed have become particularly intense thanks to an ongoing court battle and questions over whether the city council has the authority to remove it.
Now, the planned removal of the statue became a rallying cause for the alt-right — and symbol of growing discontent.
One hundred years ago, in 1917, the 26-foot-high statue was commissioned by a philanthropist and given to the city along with the surrounding land in honor of their parents. The statue took seven years and three sculptors (the first one died) to complete. According to the city of Charlottesville's website, the statue was unveiled in 1924 by 100 cadets from the Virginia Military Institute who "paraded through the center of Charlottesville decorated with Confederate colors." The new statue was also reportedly greeted with loud cheers and a speech by then-president of "the University of Virginia Edwin Alderman and followed by parties and balls.
It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The registration form from the Department of the Interior states that the sculpture "remains undisturbed in its original location. Charlottesville will undoubtedly keep it there, for the monument is a unique to the most eminent Confederate hero of all and an outstanding example of the outdoor sculpture of the late City Beautiful movement."
It is now doubtful — though still possible — that Charlottesville will "keep it there." In February, the city council voted 3-2 to sell the statue, ignoring the recommendation of a commission that suggested moving it.
A group called Virginia's Sons of Confederate Veterans sued the city, alleging it did not have the right to remove the statute since it was a war memorial. A related group, and others, filed a lawsuit in New Orleans to block the removal of a Gen. Lee statue as well as one of Jefferson Davis. A federal appeals court said that city could remove its Confederate monuments.
City Councilor Bob Fenwick, who cast a tie-breaking vote in Charlottesville in April (that vote allowed the city to sell the statue), hoped the city council's action would put to bed more than a year of heated debate in their city. "For now, it is now time for our city to rest," they said, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
But that didn't happen. The movement against removal of the statue grew — there is a Facebook group to Save the Robert E. Lee Statue and call for donations to "fund litigation to preserve our monuments." The backlash to the planned removal culminated in a white nationalist rally last weekend, which used the planned removal as a rallying cause. It is important to note, however, that the group behind hte lawsuit, SVC, condemned the Charlottesville rallies. Chaplain-in-chief Ray Parker wrote on Facebook over the weekend: "I condemn in the strongest possible way the actions, words, and beliefs of the KKK and other white supremacist groups."
The statue has also been tagged with graffiti several times in the past few years, including with "black lives matter" and "native land."
In May, a judge granted a temporary injunction, which meant the statue could not be removed for next six months. So, for now, the statue is still standing in what used to be Lee Park. Only the city council also voted earlier this year to rename the park, an action that was upheld by a judge. Gen. Lee now, rather ironically, sits in Emancipation Park.
Remember this: There is always another election. And the 2018 congressional elections already promise to be extraordinary.
Let's look at the landscape so far. Last week, voters in Kansas surprised Republicans by barely winning a district that was supposed to be safe. President Donald J. Trump tweeted: “Great win in Kansas last night for Ron Estes, easily winning the Congressional race against the Dems, who spent heavily & predicted victory!” And, indeed, a late surge had many Democrats thinking victory. But Kansas is a deep red state. The district was represented by Mike Pompeo, who's now director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who won by a margin of 30 points. Trump's margin in the same district was 27 points. And Tuesday? Estes won the district by less than seven percentage points.
The Washington Post points out that special elections are complicated. A lot of factors are at work beyond voters' view of the White House. “But a sharp shift to the left in even deep-red parts of the country has obvious implications for the GOP that this experiment simply lays bare: the potential for an electoral disaster,” the Post said.
The shift from a House managed by Paul Ryan to one led by Nancy Pelosi would have huge implications for the Trump administration — and certainly for federal-tribal relations and programs.
Was Kansas the beginning of something bigger? Look for more answers to emerge in Georgia this week and Montana in May.
At this point you can boil down this race to one question: Who will show up?
Tuesday voters in suburban Atlanta will weigh in. That special election to replace Tom Price (the Health and Human Services Secretary) is a “blanket primary,” meaning that all candidates run on the same ballot regardless of party. Then the top two positions—unless one wins 50 percent vote—will face each other again. A number of Republicans are splitting the conservative vote. The Democrat in the race, Jon Ossoff, has been leading in polls from the low- to mid-40s. Enough to win this round, but not enough to win the seat. Yet. Or maybe.
At this point you can boil down this race to one question: Who will show up? If more Democrats than normal show up (by about nine points) they could win this seat on Tuesday. That's still possible in June but more difficult in a one-on-one race.
Indian Country's first judgement of the Trump administration comes in Montana on May 25. Montana voters will pick a replacement for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Zinke defeated Denise Juneau to win re-election. Now the race is between a singing cowboy, Rob Quist, and a wealthy entrepreneur, Greg Gianforte, who lost the November race for governor.
But that's only the headline race. What makes the Montana special election more interesting is that the Libertarian Party is also on the ballot. Mark Wicks is a rancher and writer from Inverness. At the same time, other party candidates, including the Green Party and independents, did not get enough signatures to make the ballot.
This will be a three-way race.
So this will be a three-way race. Libertarians are more popular in Montana than any other state. (Indeed: I think one of the challenges for Juneau's historic bid for Congress was that the Libertarians did not engage in a serious campaign. In the 2012 Senate race, Libertarian Mike Cox picked up nearly 7 percent of the vote in the race between Democrat Jon Tester and Republican Denny Rehberg.)
One important issue for Indian Country has yet to be resolved: the election process itself. Many county clerks and voting advocates have argued the special election is the ideal test for a vote-by-mail election and would save the state hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, many in the Legislature argued that would give Democrats an advantage. The bill was killed. But Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock used an “amendatory veto” to revive the legislation. The Montana Legislature has not yet taken up that legislation even as county clerks move forward without a plan for a general mail ballot. I would love to see a major experiment with mail balloting for tribal communities. Good data from Washington and Oregon shows how effective mail ballots can be as a way to increase voter participation.
Back to the big picture. How would the Trump administration change in a world where Democrats control Congress? We actually might see a hint of that soon. The federal government must pass a new spending bill by the end of this month, and it will likely be a coalition of Democrats working with Republicans to pass the measure. That means there will be funding for the Affordable Care Act, Planned Parenthood, and other programs supported by Democrats. The Republican Congress has the same problem on a spending bill as it did in the health care debate; there are not enough votes to pass a conservative alternative.
The president's party nearly always loses seats in the first election after winning the White House.
And in the House, Democrats are well-positioned by history. Remember that the president's party nearly always loses seats in the first election after winning the White House. In 2010, after Barack Obama's historic election, their party lost 63 seats in the House and 6 seats in the Senate. And according to Gallup polling, since 1946, when presidents are above 50 percent approval, their party loses an average of 14 House seats compared with an average loss of 36 seats when presidents are below that mark. And President Trump remains far below that mark.
In 2016, a remarkable group of Native Americans running for the Congress. For that to happen again, in this next cycle, there needs to be a recruitment of candidates.
In Arizona, for example, Victoria Steele would be well-suited to run again against Rep. Martha McSally. McSally would have to defend Trump's unpopularity in a swing district.
It would be interesting to see a strong Alaska Native candidate surface in Alaska against Rep. Don Young. Young was lucky that the health care bill failed when it did because they did not need to take a vote. They would have had to choose between their party and their state (Medicaid expansion works in Alaska and the House bill would have cost Alaskans more per person than any other state). They still may have to make that choice.
Ideally, I would like to see younger candidates from Indian Country. Young people who could build innovative, digital campaigns instead of relying on what's been done in the past in terms of fundraising and advertising.
This is why the special elections right now are so important. Because win or lose in Kansas, Georgia, and Montana, they show that the House is not cemented to Republican leadership. The 2018 election cycle will be very different than the one that moved Trump into the White House. And all it takes is for a few potential candidates to see the possibility … and to think, “I can do that.”

Imagine you've been asked to oversee building a brand-new manufacturing plant optimized with the latest digital technologies including advanced robotics, sensors, 3D printing, data analytics, automation and the Internet of Things (IoT). You have a limitless budget except the company requires that all of the technology remains on a Microsoft DOS operating system.
Ridiculous, right? Even if you could find some things that might work, making that plant Industry 4.0 competitive would be an impossible task.
Still, many manufacturers are doing something similar with their workforce. They've focused on investing in new technologies, while operating on outdated people strategies. Meanwhile, the gap continues to widen between the skills that available workers have and those that manufacturing jobs demand.
Here are four key areas to help you update your talent strategy from a traditional to an Industry 4.0 approach:
1. Traditional Approach: Product first, people second
Product is king. Many manufacturers focus on how they need to change the product before they think of the implications for their people. Workers have to adopt the changes or risk their jobs.
When the labor market was flooded with qualified manufacturing workers, it was often relatively efficient to take this approach. But as manufacturing jobs grow more complex and the pool of interested and qualified workers dwindles, a product-first approach is more likely to breed resentment among workers or drive them out completely.
Industry 4.0 Approach: Build change champions
Implementing change in the world of Industry 4.0 depends first on getting employees to embrace the changes. That process starts by developing “change champions” who are ready to embrace innovation and have the ability to influence others in their networks to adopt transformation.
These champions are usually digital-savvy, can listen to others' issues with empathy, and have excellent communication skills.
Manufacturers should aim to build 15-30% of their workforce as change champions, spread across mission-critical roles, from frontline leaders to plant managers to advanced technical experts.
2. Traditional Approach: Employee engagement is a bonus, not a necessity
Traditionally, decision-making in manufacturing was made from the top down, with lower-level workers awaiting instructions from their managers. In that environment, having an engaged workforce was a bonus, but less important than having people who could effectively implement orders.
Industry 4.0 Approach: Operationalize engagement skills
As manufacturers are increasingly driving toward lean, high-technology environments, it's critical to have a highly engaged workers who take ownership over their work and can quickly solve problems. In fact, DDI research shows that companies with high leadership quality and engagement are nine times more likely to outperform their peers financially.
Many manufacturing companies have no idea how to solve the engagement problem, or try to solve it with short-term employee incentives they hope will improve engagement. But the best way to address the problem is to operationalize engagement by training leaders in how to demonstrate key engagement behaviors—including selling the vision, inspiring passion, providing timely feedback, delegating and following up, and helping to close skill gaps.
Applying these skills must become a part of the way the company operates, not just a “nice to have” value.
3. Traditional Approach: Hire for skills and experience
The common-sense approach to recruitment in manufacturing is to hire people who have the experience and skills to meet the demands of the job. In the environment of Industry 4.0, however, the pace of change has accelerated, quickly making skills and experience irrelevant. Instead, personality is proving to be much more relevant on the job.
In fact, a 2015 study by The MPI Group showed that, at more than 300 manufacturing sites, poorly selected personal attributes and competencies were much more likely to be the cause of termination than technical and professional “know-how,” education, or past achievements.
Industry 4.0 Approach: Hire for learning potential
Industry 4.0 leaders must demand a radical shift in their hiring and promotion practices to focus less on skills and experience, and instead look for individuals who demonstrate strength in agility, continuous learning, interpersonal communication, and proactive problem-solving skills.
Manufacturers should start by looking for these skills within their existing workforce, and ensure that these skills are either already present or developed in their leaders before they apply these radical new criteria across their frontline hiring practices. Otherwise, companies may see an uptick in turnover and worker dissatisfaction as workers who are ready to learn, grow and adapt feel thwarted by their leaders.
4. Traditional Approach: Learning to be a leader happens by trial and error
Manufacturing leaders often determine their approach to leadership by observing their bosses on the job, and end up copying the behaviors they like or vowing to do things differently.
Formal leadership development, if it happens at all, occurs in bits and pieces during infrequent seminars in which participants are “talked at” for a few hours about leadership. As most manufacturers were more segmented in the past, this approach to leadership development was often good enough to accomplish baseline quotas in various parts of the company. But in the streamlined world of Industry 4.0, such an inconsistent approach hampers collaboration and stands in the way of implementing major changes.
Industry 4.0 Leader Approach: Create purposeful learning journeys
A purposeful learning journey combining face-to-face learning with online learning that helps hone on-the-job-skills can help manufacturers achieve more consistency in their leadership. This learning should be spread out over a specific time frame to avoid overwhelming participants.
Given enough capital, any manufacturer can invest in the latest technology. But without the right people in place to optimize that new technology, it will take a long time to recover the investment.

Keaton Jones
Keaton Jones' pleas to their mother of why a person would ever bully someone else captured the broken hearts of a nation as the clip went viral. People from all walks of life shared Keaton's tearful words, and celebrities from Snoop Dogg to Cardi B and nearly the whole WWE roster wanted Keaton to know that things get better. Even LeBron James invited them to a Cavs practice.
As the video continued to pick up steam, the Tennessee Titans football team organized a meeting with the teen, and Captain America himself, Chris Evans, invited them to the premiere of Avengers: Infinity Gauntlet.
https://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/939976020479938562
The cherry on top of Keaton's newfound fame and friends was a college fund set up on GoFundMe which raised over $57,000 in a matter of a weekend. Now, with the news coming out that Keaton's mother Kimberly Jones has a history of posting problematic things on Facebook. She's ranted against Black Lives Matter, posed proudly with a Confederate flag, and now people that supported Keaton are wondering if it's all a big sham coming from someone who has allegedly done quite a bit of bullying themselves towards people that are different than them
This sent legions of furious people to decry the active GoFundMe page, which prompted Joseph Lam, the man who started the GoFundMe (and who used a Ronald Reagan quote on a socialistic platform to raise money for an expensive college tuition that the government is moving to de-subsidize in lieu of tax cuts to the rich) to freeze it for the time being.
“As many of you know I paused the donations as well as the comments. As I sit back and read these comments and watched the video again I feel I have to make this update. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE MOM!! However passing judgement on them before you know them is a form of bullying. Condemnation before evaluation is the ultimate form of ignorance. I can't even say for sure that any of whats being said is true. I don't know the family personally and never claimed to have known them. This is about a kid who's been bullied and not just one kid, Keaton, there are many unspoken cases about kids being bullied. We have to be the voice for the voiceless. In the video I saw a kid crying not just for themselves but for others. To me thats a kid with a heart of gold and deserves praise. Im hoping that we can turn the money into something good whether it be for private school or college fund. Im in touch with GFM on how to proceed at this point. Thank you every one that donated.”
Lam's statement seems somewhat obtuse. Will the money still go to Keaton?

The Michigan State Police came up with a clever idea to shorten the fall. Acting fast they organized a row of 13 semi truck drivers to remain in place under the bridge to shorten the distance the man would fall if they were to jump.
Police received the call around 1 a.m this morning that there was a man threatening suicide. Several local law enforcement agencies were on the scene along with negotiators.
After several hours the situation ended peacefully with the man walking off the bridge. They were then taken by police to Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak for evaluation.
If you or a loved one is feeling distressed, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The crisis center provides free and confidential emotional support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for civilians and veterans.

There is more to the Old Fort's siege weekend than cannon blasts and the smell of gun powder.
Hundreds of history buffs travelled to Fort Erie from many parts of the U.S. and Canada to play a role in battles and demonstrations on Saturday and Sunday but there's another important community of people who participate in-character each year.
There are merchants, tradespeople and other historic occupations depicted by people offering a number of goods and services.
One of them is Terry Sanderson, an Oakville resident who is a leather worker that makes belts and other accessories that would have been worn and used by both civilians and military personnel.
Their hobby started 34 years ago with a focus on the French and Indian War but for the last 15 years they have primarily paid the most attention to the fine details of the War of 1812.
“There's a lot of research done trying to find the right colours and patterns,” said Sanderson, who started their craft through their brother's interest in military uniforms and regalia.
“It just evolved from there into this little hobby-business,” they said.
Across the way from Sanderson at the Old Fort on the weekend was The Elegant Thimble, a collective of three women from the Kitchener and Chatham-Kent areas who make period clothing that females during the early 19th century would have been seen in.
Working together for close to 15 years, the trio says they probably have 100 years of research experience altogether – which includes trips to historical sites and a lot of books.
“It's years of museum visits and our book collections could sink homes,” said Dawn Luckham, standing with their colleagues Charlene Roberts and Lisa Gilbert.
One of the biggest challenges with their work is that there isn't a lot of documentation or evidence on what women wore more than 200 years ago.
“We try to be as accurate as possible and also educate the public,” said Gilbert.
It also helps exercise both sides of the brain.
“For me, it satisfies the creative seamstress side of me – but also the intellectual researcher side of me,” they said.
All three said they love coming to the annual weekend in Fort Erie to enjoy the family atmosphere and comradery that exists in the re-enactment community but are also proud to offer some variety for those in attendance.
“A lot of it is about men – but there are a lot of women that come out too and we're glad to provide something for them,” said Gilbert.
An 11 year old girl from Minnesota, on vacation with their family in Lincoln City, wandered into the surf off D-River Tuesday. Suddenly they lost their footing and found themselves being moved away from the beach.
But instead of panicking, the girl remembered what they had learned about rip currents and struggled to swim parallel to the beach. The current was strong and they were struggling, trying to make sideways progress. Fortunately those on the beach realized what happened and helped them back to shore where they were checked out by North Lincoln Fire Rescue. They thought they might be hypothermic but it appeared they were perfectly fine.
North Lincoln County Fire Rescue Captain Jim Kusz says rip currents can occur literally out of the blue anywhere on any beach. They say the best way to get out of a rip current is to swim at a steady pace parallel to the beach. You may get taken out a way but once you break free of the column of water heading seaward, you'll be able to swim back to the beach and to safety.
Several people have hung a banner emblazoned with a message about abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement from the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty and have been arrested.
National Park Service spokesperson Jerry Willis says at least six people were taken into custody Wednesday. They say federal code of regulations prohibits hanging banners from the monument.
The large banner said "Abolish I.C.E." ICE is a division of the Department of Homeland Security whose officers arrest and deport unauthorized immigrants inside the U.S., among other duties.
Activists with the group Rise and Resist say they hung the banner to protest U.S. immigration policy. They oppose President Donald Trump's administration and advocate ending deportations and family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said the president's immigration policy is a step forward for public safety.

Thought for Today: "Originality and a feeling of one's own dignity are achieved only through work and struggle." — Feodor Dostoyevsky, Russian author (1821-1881).
Uma Thurman finally shared what they say happened between them and Harvey Weinstein, after writing "stay tuned" in an Instagram post about the #MeToo movement last November.

New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd said in a lengthy opinion piece that Thurman, 47, told them that they knew Weinstein, 65, “pretty well before they attacked me.”
The Oscar-nominated actor had previously worked with Weinstein when they starred in the 1994 film "Pulp Fiction," which was the first film financed by Weinstein's then-company, Miramax. Thurman told the Times that the two got to know each other after the film's success, according to Dowd's piece.
"He used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me. It possibly made me overlook warning signs," Thurman told Dowd, according to the opinion piece.

But later, Dowd reports that Thurman said, after an uncomfortable incident in a Paris hotel room where they felt they tried to lure them into a steam room, they were attacked in the Savoy Hotel in London.
"It was such a bat to the head. They pushed me down. They tried to shove themselves on me. They tried to expose himself. They did all kinds of unpleasant things," Thurman said, according to Dowd's report. "But they didn't actually put their back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not their track."
Noting that they were staying with their friend, Robert De Niro's longtime makeup artist, Ilona Herman, Thurman claims that the next day a "26-inch-wide vulgar bunch of roses" arrived to Herman's home in Fulham, the op-ed columnist wrote.

"They were yellow. And I opened the note like it was a soiled diaper and it just said, ‘You have great instincts,'" Thurman claimed, according to Dowd.
Thurman also went on to tell Dowd that Weinstein threatened to derail their career in another hotel meeting, according to the opinion piece.
Thurman joins a chorus of women in Hollywood -- including Oscar winners Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Mira Sorvino -- who've accused the disgraced producer of sexually assaulting or harassing them.
In a statement to ABC News in response to claims attributed to Thurman in Dowd's New York Times opinion piece, a rep for Weinstein said, "We have pulled a number of images that demonstrate the strong relationship Mr. Weinstein and Ms. Thurman had had over the years and we wish the New York Times would have published them."
"Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms. Thurman in England after misreading their signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which they immediately apologized and deeply regrets," the statement continued. "However, their claims about being physically assaulted are untrue. And this is the first time we have heard those details.
"There was no physical contact during Mr. Weinstein's awkward pass and Mr. Weinstein is saddened and puzzled as to 'why' Ms. Thurman, someone they consider a colleague and a friend, waited 25 years to make these allegations public, noting that they and Ms. Thurman have shared a very close and mutually beneficial working relationship where they have made several very successful film projects together.
"This is the first time we are hearing that they considered Mr. Weinstein an enemy and the pictures of their history tell a completely different story. There will be more are detailed response later from Mr. Weinstein's attorney, Ben Brafman," the statement concluded.
In a statement to the New York Times, Weinstein denied ever trying to hurt Thurman's career, adding that they thought Thurman is “a brilliant actor."
Before Saturday's opinion piece, Thurman hinted about a sour relationship with Weinstein in an Instagram post, in which they wished their fans a happy Thanksgiving "except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators."
The actor also told Access Hollywood, in an October interview about sexual harassment in Hollywood that they would talk about it soon, but was "waiting to feel less angry."
Weinstein's attorney, Ben Brafman, on Saturday afternoon issued a statement that echoes Weinstein's and said statements attributed to Thurman in the Times opinion piece would be examined to see whether legal action would be appropriate.
"Harvey is stunned and saddened by what they claim to be false accusations by Uma Thurman, someone they have worked closely with for more than two decades. Mr. Weinstein acknowledges making an awkward pass at Ms. Thurman 25 years ago, which they regret and immediately apologized for," the lawyer's statement says. "Why Ms. Thurman would wait 25 years to publicly discuss this incident and why according to Weinstein, they would embellish what really happened to include false accusations of attempted physical assault is a mystery to Weinstein and their attorneys. Ms. Thurman's statements to the Times are being carefully examined and investigated before deciding whether any legal action against them would be appropriate."

Bryan Habana announced their retirement earlier this afternoon, bringing down the curtain on what has been a quite extraordinary career.
He'll forever be remembered as a World Cup winner, with their performances under Jake White back in 2007 playing a large role in the Springboks' success, and they also racked up two Super Rugbies titled with the Bulls.
Bryan took to Instagram, posting this image:
Along with this caption:
So it's my turn to say Thank You:
The inevitable moment has come knocking on my door and I've welcomed it in for a drink. .
It's been more than a year of hoping, trying, pushing and willing to get back on the field for one last time, to taste the sweet victory or encounter that gut-wrenching despair. To hear the roar of the crowd or grab the pill out of the air. To make that last bone crunching tackle or score that last game winning try. But it's unfortunately just not to be. I, like most, would have liked my career to have ended differently, but sometimes things don't turn out quite the way we hope for.
So at the end of this season, it's time to say goodbye and thank you to the game I so dearly love. .
To try and sum up the past 16 years and how quickly they've flown by or even begin to describe how amazing the journey has been is impossible. .
I would though like to express my gratitude:
. • First and foremost, to God for blessing me with the talent to play this beautiful game.
• To my wife Janine, Timothy and our newborn Gabriel, for your support, sacrifice and love to follow me to all corners of the earth so that I can pursue my dreams. • To my family and friends, far and wide, who wore their hearts on their sleeves as much as I did.
• To the coaches, team-mates, medical and support staff in all the teams I was involved in.
• To every opponent that made the battle tough and worthwhile.
• To all my sponsors over the years who believed in me enough to support me on the journey.
• To the fans, who make the game what it is.
• To the critics, not to prove you wrong but so that I could prove to myself I could.
• To the media, who take the game to households the world over.
• To the lessons learnt, through the good times and the bad.
• To the friendships made and experiences a plenty.
But most of all to Rugby, because for me it truly is a game made in heaven. .
As a close friend one said: “memories are all we have.” And I'm immensely grateful for the memories I take with me into the next chapter. .
With much respect

NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) - The Latest on Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial (all times local):
6:10 p.m.
The jury in Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial is expected to begin deliberating the comedian's fate on Wednesday.
Judge Steven O'Neill says jurors indicated they were exhausted after listening to more than five hours of closing arguments on Tuesday.
Cosby is charged with drugging and molesting a woman at their suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. The 80-year-old comedian says their encounter with Andrea Constand was consensual.
Their lawyers told the panel of seven men and five women Tuesday that Constand made up the assault allegation as part of a scheme to file suit and extract millions of dollars from Cosby.
Prosecutor Stewart Ryan urged jurors to "look that man in the eye and tell them the truth about what they did."
The Associated Press doesn't typically identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission. Constand has done so.
___
5:30 p.m.
A prosecutor is attacking Bill Cosby's star defense witness.
Prosecutor Stewart Ryan said in their closing argument Tuesday that Marguerite Jackson's testimony was "fictional."
Jackson is a Temple University academic adviser who testified that Cosby's chief accuser, Andrea Constand, once spoke of falsely accusing a high-profile person of sexual assault so they could file a lawsuit.
Ryan called it a "fictional conversation."
They also rejected the defense explanation that Cosby paid nearly $3.4 million to settle Constand's civil lawsuit in 2006 because it was a nuisance and they feared bad publicity.
Cosby is charged with drugging and assaulting Constand at their home outside Philadelphia. They say their sexual encounter was consensual. Their lawyers say Constand framed them so they could file suit.
The Associated Press doesn't typically identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission. Constand has done so.
___
3:30 p.m.
A prosecutor at Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial says they used their good-guy image as America's Dad to gain unsuspecting women's trust before knocking them out with powerful drugs and violating them.
Prosecutor Kristen Feden delivered closing arguments Tuesday, saying Cosby is "nothing like the image that they played on TV."
They say Cosby led a secret life that ran counter to the wholesome image they projected as Dr. Cliff Huxtable on their top-rated 1980s sitcom.
Cosby is charged with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman at their suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. They say the encounter was consensual. Their lawyers have called their chief accuser a con artist who falsely accused Cosby in hopes of a big payday.
Feden says Cosby is the true con artist.
The jury is expected to begin deliberating later Tuesday.
The Associated Press doesn't typically identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission. Constand has done so.
___
12:10 p.m.
Bill Cosby's lawyers are urging a jury to acquit the 80-year-old comedian of sexual assault charges they say are based on "flimsy, silly, ridiculous evidence."
The defense at Cosby's retrial gave its closing argument Tuesday. Their lawyers slammed chief accuser Andrea Constand as a "pathological liar." They highlighted more than a dozen inconsistencies in what Constand has said over the years about their relationship with Cosby and their allegations that they drugged and molested them at their suburban Philadelphia home.
Cosby's wife of 54 years was in the courtroom for their lawyers' arguments.
Prosecutors will deliver their closing argument next. The jury is expected to get the case later Tuesday.
Cosby says their encounter with Constand was consensual. A jury deadlocked on the charges last year, setting the stage for a retrial.

9:50 a.m.
Bill Cosby's spokesperson says the comedian's wife will be in the courtroom for the defense closing argument.
Cosby arrived for the 12th day of their sexual assault retrial Tuesday morning accompanied for the first time by Camille, their wife of 54 years.
Cosby spokesperson Andrew Wyatt says they didn't want Camille and other family members there for the rest of the trial.
Wyatt says she's in court to support defense lawyers Tom Mesereau and Kathleen Bliss as they deliver their closing argument, just as they were there to support their husband's lawyer during closing arguments at last year's trial. That jury deadlocked on the charges.

8:45 a.m.
Bill Cosby has arrived for the 12th day of their sexual assault retrial, accompanied for the first time by their wife of 54 years.
The 80-year-old and their wife, Camille, didn't talk to reporters as they entered the suburban Philadelphia courthouse, where closing arguments and deliberations are expected Tuesday.
The comedian is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault.
The charges stem from Andrea Constand's allegations that they drugged and molested them at their suburban Philadelphia mansion in January 2004.
Cosby's lawyers devoted part of their case to travel records they say prove they couldn't have been there when they say the alleged assault happened.
They argue that any encounter there with Constand would have happened earlier, outside the statute of limitations.
The Associated Press doesn't typically identify people who say they're victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

Bill Cosby's sexual assault retrial will soon be in the hands of a jury.
Closing arguments and deliberations are set for Tuesday. The defense rested Monday after Cosby said they wouldn't testify.

When Consumer Reports reviewed Tesla's first mass-market electric car, the Model 3, it concluded that it couldn't recommend the car to its readers because of “big flaws,” including long stopping distances when braking at high speed.
Within days, Tesla beamed a wireless software update to the Model 3s on the road that improved their braking, and the impact was swift. After testing the car again, Consumer Reports reversed the verdict on Wednesday, only nine days after its original report was published, and gave the car a “recommended” rating.
“To see something updated that quickly is quite remarkable,” said Jake Fisher, the magazine's director of auto testing. Other manufacturers have made software fixes to correct issues that Consumer Reports has identified, but owners then have to take their cars to dealers to have the update installed.
Tesla's ability to update its cars in much the same way that Apple issues software updates for iPhones is a competitive advantage, Mr. Fisher said. “We've never seen a manufacturer do this in the course of a week,” they added.

By Arathy S Nair
(Reuters) - DuPont and Chemours Co have agreed to pay $671 million in cash to settle thousands of lawsuits involving a leak of a toxic chemical used to make Teflon, the companies said on Monday.
Shares of Chemours jumped 13 percent. The company said it would pay half of the settlement, although liability for litigation connected with the chemical was passed onto it when DuPont spun it off in 2015.
In addition, Jefferies analyst Alexander Laurence said the liability was $300 million below Wall Street estimates, and DuPont shares rose 1 percent.
The companies settled about 3,550 personal injury claims arising from the leak of perfluorooctanoic acid, which is also known as PFOA or C-8, from its plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia.
The leak allegedly contaminated local water supplies and has been linked to six diseases, including testicular and kidney cancers.
"We look forward to working with DuPont to finalize this settlement and get these injured class members paid as quickly as possible," plaintiffs' lawyer Rob Bilott said in a statement.
Both companies denied any wrongdoing.
DuPont said in a statement that it had stopped using C-8 in operations at the West Virginia plant more than a decade ago. It had used the chemical there since the early 1950s.
Chemours General Counsel David Shelton called the settlement a "sound resolution."
The settlement comes as DuPont and Dow Chemical Co expect to close their $130 billion merger later this year.
In 2001, residents brought a class action against DuPont over C-8 exposure. The company agreed in 2004 to fund medical monitoring programs and install new water treatment systems.
DuPont convened a panel of scientists to determine whether any diseases were linked to C-8. The panel concluded that there was a probable link with six illnesses: kidney and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, pregnancy-induced hypertension and high cholesterol.
Members of the class action lawsuit also sued DuPont individually, and the litigation was consolidated in federal court in Columbus, Ohio. The company agreed not to challenge whether C-8 can cause the diseases.
Three verdicts in the litigation totaled $19.7 million. Most recently, a jury last month ordered DuPont to pay a plaintiff $12.5 million, including $10.5 million in punitive damages.
The case is In re E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company C-8 Personal Injury Litigation, U.S. District Court for Southern Ohio, No. 13-2433.

Concealed Carry Doesn't Have To Be Uncomfortable.
Here Are Some Packing Tips
By Massad Ayoob
Let's face it, carrying a concealed handgun can be inconvenient. Maybe it requires one more garment than you want on a hot day. Or maybe the gun digs into your side. Over the years, for comfort's sake, many detectives and Federal agents decided their desk drawer, glove box, or briefcase was the most comfortable holster and didn't bulge their Brooks Brothers suit. Those folks had sacrificed potentially life-saving access for comfort.
As an example of balancing comfort and access I offer this formula: Comfort=N82. That would stand for Nate Squared. A few years ago at the NRA National Meeting, I met a couple of guys named Nate (Nate squared, get it? I thought it was cute) who came up with an intriguing variation of the hybrid holster. The shell surrounding three sides of the gun was hard synthetic, but the big, wide backing design on the wearer's side made it different.
As the Nates say, “Since 2009, our holsters have been designed with a patented three-layer backing that completely isolates your handgun from contact with your body. The facing leather provides a durable, pliable, and most important, natural material for your handgun to contact. Nate Squared pioneered the use of neoprene in the holster industry. This waterproof material provides a moisture barrier between you and your handgun and also adds to the comfort of the holster. Some people have an allergic reaction to neoprene and neoprene doesn't allow the skin to breathe. This prompted the use of soft suede leather for contact with your skin. The suede allows your skin to breathe, so even when you are in humid environments or are just out working and sweating, it will still feel cool to your skin. So, unlike our competitors, we suggest you wear the holster directly against your skin! No more undershirts!”
Any hybrid-style holster putting a shield between the grip-frame of the handgun and your body—bearing in mind these are generally inside-the-waistband holsters which hold the sidearm tight to your body already—makes it a bit more difficult for your drawing hand to get between the pistol grip and the holster's body barrier to take a good grasp. This tends to slow you down. In IDPA, the concealed carry shooting sport, I've never seen a champion competitor draw from such. (They often wore a hybrid home from the match, though.) Your fingertips have to reach past one more obstacle to take a drawing grasp and this slows you down.

exquisitely comfortable for inside the waistband carry. Photo: Gail Pepin
How much will it slow you? Only you, the gun, holster and an electronic shot timer together can answer the question. If you have some extra avoirdupois at the beltline, it's going to get in the way and slow you down, even if your inside-the-waistband holster isn't the hybrid type. Adding the body shield is certainly not going to speed up your draw and will probably slow it to some degree. We have to take this into consideration.
That said, the cushion between gun and body is delightful. The Nate Squared holster is what I'd want if I were carrying one of the RTF2 GLOCK's in my safe. These pistols, with aggressive “polymids” on the grip, chew up enough clothing that the company stopped selling them for a while. G10 style grips with aggressively rough grip surfaces can likewise take DNA samples off bare skin. With the body shield, though, you are spared the loss and just have to pay the price of the slightly slower draw.
The comfort element begs the question, “Just how much comfort are you losing due to the barrier between your side and your gun?” The answer is, “It depends.” If the situation is such your gun is so uncomfortable you leave it at home, get the N82. A slightly slower draw beats the heck out of having to go home and retrieve the pistol if you need it in the here and now.
The Nates came up with a feature they trademarked called Twist Release, to deal with concerns over some dirtbag trying to rip your gun out of the holster. To clear the pistol from a Twist Release holster, you have to pivot the butt inward to your body to clear the triggerguard from the niche holding it, and then you can do a clean, straight draw. It reminds me of the old Jay-Pee revolver holster NYPD mandated when all their cops carried revolvers in uniform. The late, great Lt. Frank McGee, head of NYPD Firearms & Tactics Unit, said “Gun experts make fun of our holsters, but criminals can't get the guns out and our cops can.”

Find The Balance
I make my living teaching firearms and speed of draw is important to me, which is why I don't often carry hybrid holsters. However, a Nate Squared for my pet GLOCK 30 sits waiting in my holster drawer for any day when I might need some extra comfort in carry. Each of us finds our own balance, and balance can tip one way or the other depending on weather, wardrobe and other factors.
The more options you have readily at hand any time you get dressed, the more likely you are to find your balance of preparedness and ordinary life on any given day.

Twenty-First Century Fox said Monday that it had incurred about $50 million in costs during the year that ended June 30 tied to the settlement of sexual harassment and discrimination allegations in its Fox News division.
That figure, disclosed in a regulatory filing, does not include the payouts made to the men ousted amid the scandal. Roger Ailes, the network's founding chairperson, received a $40 million package when they left, and Bill O'Reilly, the former top-rated host, received a payout of about $25 million.
In the filing, the company said it had $224 million in costs during the fiscal year related to “management and employee transitions and restructuring” at several of its business units, including the cable network group that houses Fox News.
The $50 million settlement figure disclosed Monday is $5 million more than what had been reported earlier. In May, the company disclosed that in the nine months leading up to March 31, it had incurred $45 million in costs tied to litigation related to harassment allegations.

The company has spent the past year trying to clean up the sexual harassment and discrimination scandal that has engulfed its Fox News division. Since the former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed suit last July against Mr. Ailes, the company has overhauled its management team, hired a new head of human resources, urged employees to report inappropriate behavior and conducted training sessions. In the wake of the scandal, Mr. Ailes, Mr. O'Reilly and several other employees were ousted.
How much it costs depends on what you're selling. Amazon asks as little as 10 rupees (just under 15 cents) for every item you sell below 1,000 rupees ($15). It asks 50 rupees (73 cents) for items between 1,000 and 5,000 rupees ($15 to $73), and 100 rupees ($1.47) for anything more expensive than that.
This isn't Amazon's first time experimenting with selling used goods. Mashable notes that Amazon's Junglee tried it back in 2015. However, a directly Amazon-branded service suggests the company is more confident this time around. It's also clearly going for the jugular of sites like eBay and Craigslist -- why do all the hard work yourself when a small fee will take care of everything? There's go guarantee that this will take off, let alone reach other countries, but it's potentially very disruptive.

An Ariane 5 rocket climbed into space from French Guiana on Tuesday evening, hauling the Sky Brasil 1 and Telkom 3S communications satellites to orbit on the way to operating posts over Brazil and Indonesia.
Firing into an overcast sky just before sunset, the 180-foot-tall (55-meter) Ariane 5 took off on 2.9 million pounds of thrust from its twin solid-fueled rocket boosters and core Vulain 2 engine, burning a mix of cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants.
Liftoff occurred at 6:39 p.m. local time in French Guiana (2139 GMT; 4:39 p.m. EST) at the opening of the day's launch window.

A woman making a long-planned trip with their parents and young son says Spirit Airlines kicked the family off the plane when they didn't immediately stop breast-feeding the 2-year-old, who was restless after a long delay.
Mei Rui, a concert pianist and cancer researcher, says they asked for a few minutes to let their son fall asleep in their arms while the plane was still at the gate in Houston and other passengers were walking around.
A Spirit spokesperson disputed the woman's account on Monday. They said Rui repeatedly failed to follow flight attendants' instructions to buckle their son into their seat after the plane's door was closed.
The spokesperson says Rui told crew members they would have to drag them off the plane while they recorded them.
Shania Twain is moving on from the sound created by their ex-husband and former producer Robert John 'Mutt' Lange.
The country star, 51, has not released a studio record since 2002, a delay that in part is down to the turmoil in their professional and personal life caused by their break-up from their husband Robert John ‘Mutt' Lange, who doubled as the producer of all their albums.
The couple's 2010 divorce came after Robert admitted an affair with Shania's best friend Marie-Anne Thiebaud. Shania ended up getting close with Marie-Anne's betrayed husband Frederic Thiebaud, and the pair wed in 2011.
 They are planning to release a new album this spring, and says they told those working on their record, including One Direction producer Jake Gosling and Bruce Springsteen collaborator Ron Aniello, to erase all their previous work from their minds.
“I told anyone getting involved musically to forget about my other records,” the musician tells Rolling Stone. “I didn't want it to be related to Mutt's productions at all. I wanted a more organic approach.”
When Robert was their producer Shania sold 85 million records and became country music's biggest pop crossover star, but they now want to move away from their pop roots.
“Most of them started off quite melancholy and a lot darker,” they explain of their new songs.
However she's philosophical about how their split from the man they shared their life and music with has affected them
“I'm a different singer now,” they share. “There was a lot of coming to terms with that. It's been one of the obstacles in my life I've just had to learn to live with.”
The country veteran's new album is yet to receive an official title, but tracks include Swinging With My Eyes Closed, and Who's Gonna Be Your Girl?, a ballad about the breakdown of their marriage.
World Malaria Day 2018: Ready to beat Malaria
Malaria remains one of the oldest diseases in the world. According to statistics from the World Health Organisation, 3.4 billion people live in areas at risk of malaria transmission in 91 countries and territories.
Malaria is a disease that is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Two of the parasite species that cause malaria in humans pose the greatest threat. The species are Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.
P. falciparum is the most prevalent malaria parasite on the African continent. It is responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally.
P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa.
The most recent report by WHO reveals an estimated 216 million malaria cases and 445,000 deaths. It also shows that an estimated 91% of deaths in 2016 were in the WHO African Region.
Symptoms
Symptoms may vary due to age, severity and the level of immunity in the individual.
In a non-immune individual, the symptoms including fever, headache, and chills may be mild making it difficult to recognize malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, malaria can become more severe and lead to death.
In Children with severe malaria, symptoms as severe anaemia, and respiratory distress are seen
Who is at risk?
The most vulnerable are persons with no or little immunity against the disease.
• Young children, who have not yet developed partial immunity to malaria
• Pregnant women, whose immunity is decreased by pregnancy, especially during the first and second pregnancies
• Travelers or migrants coming from areas with little or no malaria transmission, who lack immunity.
Prevention
Malaria can be prevented with the use of treated mosquito nets and indoor spraying with insecticides. Antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent malaria. For travellers, malaria can be prevented through chemoprophylaxis, which suppresses the blood stage of malaria infections. Keeping a clean surrounding without stagnant water also helps in preventing the breeding of the mosquitoes
Treatment
Malaria is best treated with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). The parasite P.falciparum has shown resistance to medicines such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP).

“It's a credit to those guys,” Cassidy said. “They've certainly helped put us in a good position heading into the stretch.”
Through Thursday's victory over the St. Louis Blues, Bruins rookies have accounted for 23 percent (36 of 158) of the team's goals, second most in the league to Arizona.
Center Danton Heinen and left wing Jake DeBrusk have 11 goals each, followed by the rookie defenseman Charlie McAvoy (five), who returned to practice this week after having surgery for an abnormal heart rhythm on Jan. 22 and expects to be back in the lineup next week.
Working so many young players into the lineup and a new system is not the typical route to Stanley Cup contention.
“It's tricky, even in the best of circumstances, to integrate young players into a results-oriented business,” said Andy Brickley, a TV analyst for New England Sports Network, who played 11 years in the N.H.L., four of them in Boston. “But since Bruce has taken over, everybody's on the same page.”

Boston's top line of Marchand, Bergeron and David Pastrnak features the team's top three scorers, with 62 goals among them. But the contributions to Boston's position in the standings have come throughout the lineup. Nine players have at least 20 points, and four rookies have 10 or more.
Backes, 33, who joined the Bruins for the 2016-17 season after 10 years with the Blues, said the opportunities injuries created early in the season are now benefiting Boston.

“Our younger guys are now a little more battle tested, and they can play more roles,” they said. “We've shown that we can simplify and play 2-1 games in addition to 5-4 games.”

Center Riley Nash, who is in their second year with the Bruins after five with Carolina, said that even with so many young players on the roster, Cassidy has allowed them to play to their strengths rather than adhere to a rigid system.
“He's given a lot of freedom to players who are hard-wired to play aggressively,” they said. “The good thing about this team is that everyone seems to be on the same wavelength.”
The Boston connections run deep for some of the new Bruins.
McAvoy, 20, and the first-year defenseman Matt Grzelcyk, 24, played at Boston University. Grzelcyk's father, John, has worked on the TD Garden “Bull Gang,” which changes the hockey rink to a basketball court and vice versa, since Matt learned to skate.
Considering Bruins General Manager Don Sweeney, who was hired before the 2015-16 season, played four years of hockey at Harvard, it is not surprising there is a strong presence of former N.C.A.A. players on the team.
Heinen, 22, the team's leading rookie scorer with 33 points, played at Denver University. Others from the college ranks include Nash (Cornell), center Frank Vatrano (University of Massachusetts), defenseman Kevan Miller (Vermont), center Sean Kuraly (Miami University) and center Tim Schaller (Providence).
More former collegians could be making contributions to the Bruins soon. Forward Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson, a second-round pick in 2015 and a former teammate of McAvoy and Grzelcyk at Boston University, is in their second year at the Bruins' American Hockey League affiliate in Providence.
Ryan Donato, a second-rounder in 2014, leads Division I in goals (20) in their junior season at Harvard and will play on the United States Olympic team this month.  They are expected to make the jump to the N.H.L. next season, following in the footsteps of their father, Ted, who played more than 500 games with the Bruins.
Brickley, a former all-American forward at New Hampshire, said Cassidy learned to trust younger players while coaching the A.H.L. team in Providence from 2011 to 2016, even though they promote an aggressive style of play.
“His feeling is, ‘Let's get the next one,' not just protect leads,” Brickley said. “He trusts young players and gives them responsibility.”
(Reuters) - Three people were shot dead at a drag race track in Wisconsin on Sunday, authorities said, but it was unclear who was responsible and what the motive might have been.
The shooting took place at the Great Lakes Dragaway in Union Grove, Wisconsin, Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told reporters at the track in news footage carried on the FOX6 News website.
Several thousand people were at the track at the time, which was evacuated. About 100 police officers responded to the shootings, interviewing witnesses, combing for evidence and helping with the investigation.
No suspects were in custody, authorities said, and no motive had been determined.
"We're not aware of any danger to the community," Beth said.
The victims, all men in their 20s or early 30s, were from Illinois. Their identities were not released.
The men were standing near a food vendor when a gunman approached and shot them at what appeared to have been point-blank range, Beth told reporters.
Two friends who were with the victims "had no idea what caused this," they said.
"We're not aware of any altercations that might have happened earlier," Beth said.

Cash Money is facing a new lawsuit alleging missing profits from Drake's first six albums.
Related: Drake, Migos Joins Future on Stage at Coachella
According to documents reviewed by Billboard, Aspire Music Group filed the suit against Cash Money co-owners Bryan “Birdman” Williams and Ronald “Slim” Williams today (April 17) in Manhattan.
Aspire alleges their deal with Cash Money was for one-third of the net royalties on Drake's first six albums and that with the exception of small advances, they have not been paid. They also claim that monthly accounting was sporadic, and eventually stopped. Aspire requested that the court supervises a full review of Cash Money's finances to determine the amount they are owed.

John Chiang, California's treasurer, urged board members of the state's pension funds on Friday to divest holdings of retailers that sell guns and ammunition around the country that are illegal in California, which has stricter gun laws than most states. The letter came in the wake of this week's mass shooting in Las Vegas that left 59 dead and more than 500 wounded.
“Shock and sympathy provide little consolation to the families who must now bury a child, a sibling, a spouse, or a loved one,” Mr. Chiang, a Democrat, wrote in a letter to the Teachers' Retirement Board, which administers the California State Teachers' Retirement System, known as Calstrs. “Let us leave our platitudes and rituals of grief at the door and focus on what can be done to deny weapons of mass carnage to the next loon.”
After the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, when a gunman shot dead 20 schoolchildren, California pension funds began the process of divesting investments in gun manufacturers. Moving against retailers would be an escalation of the state's efforts to excise connections to guns from the nation's largest pension system.
It would not be without precedent. Last year, New York City Employees' Retirement System voted to divest its shares in Dick's Sporting Goods, Cabela's and Big 5 Sporting Goods.

Irish bishop hopes papal visit can help bring healing after abortion vote Catholic News Service
By Michael Kelly
DUBLIN (CNS) — An Irish bishop said they hope Pope Francis' August visit can help bring healing after a divisive referendum that will pave the way for abortion on demand up to 12 weeks' gestation.
In a May 25 referendum, voters opted by a margin of 66.4 percent to 33.6 percent to remove the right to life of the unborn from the constitution.
Bishop Brendan Leahy of Limerick told Massgoers May 26 that the result “is deeply regrettable and chilling for those of us who voted ‘no.'”
They said “the final result of the referendum is the will of the majority of the people, though not all the people.”
“It is a vote, of course, that does not change our position. Our message is one of love: love for all, love for life, for those with us today, for those in the womb,” they said.
Referring to Pope Francis' Aug. 25-26 visit, Bishop Leahy said: “In August, we will unite as a family, to renew that sense of family when the World Meeting of Families comes here. We have the privilege of Pope Francis coming, and today I cannot think of their visit being more timely: to come here and remind us of the importance of family, of the love we have of family, of the reality that, yes, families get bruised sometimes, but they should never be broken.
“So we go forward to that moment, we look forward to the healing it will bring and how we will be renewed again in love and care for one another,” they said.
Archbishop Diarmuid Martin of Dublin insisted that “the Irish church after the referendum must renew its commitment to support life.”
Speaking during a homily at Mass for the ordination to the diaconate of four seminarians at the national seminary in Maynooth, County Kildare, Archbishop Martin insisted that the church is called to be pro-life “not just in words and statements and manifestoes, but to be pro-life in deeds, by being a church which reflects the loving care of Jesus for human life at any stage.
“That loving care includes support to help those women who face enormous challenges and who grapple with very difficult decisions to choose life,” they said.
Archbishop Martin said during the homily that “the challenge of witnessing to Jesus Christ in today's world is not an easy one. Many will see the results of Friday's referendum as an indication that the Catholic Church in Ireland is regarded today by many with indifference and as having a marginal role in the formation of Irish culture.
“The church that is called to make present the Jesus who is full of mercy and compassion is seen by many as somehow weak in compassion,” they said.

When President Donald Trump's U.N. ambassador recently urged the world to sever diplomatic ties with North Korea, they were sketchy on the details: Should all embassies close? How about those providing the U.S. intelligence from the largely inscrutable country? And what of Sweden, which helps with imprisoned Americans?
Nikki Haley's recent call to action underscores the challenge for the United States as it tries to advance a nonmilitary strategy for resolving the nuclear standoff with North Korea. Isolating the reclusive, totalitarian state has been a central component of the U.S. plan, even though Washington says it remains open to talks.
Like international economic penalties, the Trump administration believes the diplomatic isolation serves two purposes.
It's designed to punish North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for developing an atomic arsenal of bombs and intercontinental missiles that potentially could deliver nuclear warheads anywhere in the United States. U.S. officials also contend that freezing out North Korea could drive Kim's government to seek negotiations.
"We do know they care a lot about their international reputation," said Mark Tokola, a former No. 2 at the U.S. Embassy in South Korea.
Trump's team has chalked up some successes in narrowing the North's diplomatic reach. Mexico, Peru, Italy, Spain, and Kuwait have expelled North Korean ambassadors from their countries. Haley said Portugal and the United Arab Emirates have suspended diplomatic relations. Others have cut trade and security ties.
But North Korea isn't and won't be completely isolated.
Last month, China, whose once-close relationship with North Korea has been strained by its adoption of tough U.N. sanctions, sent its highest level envoy to Pyongyang in two years. North Korea also recently welcomed a Russian parliamentary delegation, in a sign of increasing contacts between the former Cold War partners. And the North just hosted the most senior U.N. official to visit in years: Jeffrey Feltman, the undersecretary-general for political affairs.
Even before they departed, experts played down expectations that Feltman, formerly a senior American diplomat, could offer a breakthrough as the standoff over the North's nuclear weapons threatens to spiral into war. Feltman carried no message from Washington, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said.
Yet Feltman's visit, which included an audience with Kim's foreign minister, added to questions about how effectively the U.S. can isolate North Korea. Feltman left Pyongyang on Saturday after four days of talks with the North Korean Foreign Ministry. "I have to brief the secretary-general first," they said when asked for details of their trip.
Also unresolved is whether Trump and their top advisers have a game plan for the second half of a strategy they've called "maximum pressure and engagement." If North Korea signals a willingness to negotiate, now that Kim has declared that they have "realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force," how will the U.S. respond?
"This is probably as good a time as any to try to pivot to engagement," said Suzanne DiMaggio at the New America think tank, who has been involved in several rounds of unofficial talks with North Korean officials. They said the administration has focused almost completely on pressure.
Kim's declaration followed North Korea's test last month of its most powerful intercontinental missile yet, which led Haley, at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting, to speak of a world "closer to war." At the same time, they pushed for others to cut trade and diplomatic ties with Pyongyang.
U.S. officials say doing so would stop North Korea from abusing diplomatic privileges that allow it to raise revenues or conduct illegal business in support of its nuclear and missile programs. It's also intended to exploit North Korean sensitivity to its international standing.
But the U.S. has given mixed messages on what form concretely the isolation should take.
Haley called on all governments to sever ties. Other U.S. officials say the emphasis is on getting North Korean diplomats expelled from overseas postings, not on closing foreign embassies in Pyongyang. To date, no embassies have shut down in the North Korean capital as a result of the U.S. campaign.
According to research by the Washington-based East-West Center and the National Committee on North Korea, North Korea maintains diplomatic relations with 167 countries. It has embassies in 47 foreign capitals. Twenty-four countries have embassies in Pyongyang, and those include American rivals and friends.
"If the U.S. is really serious about depriving North Korea of diplomatic relations, it must start with its own closest ally, Great Britain," said Artyom Lukin, a North Korea expert at Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok, Russia.
Since the U.S. has no diplomatic presence of its own in North Korea — the two sides remain technically in a state of war — it relies to some extent on Britain, Germany and other partners to stay abreast of what's happening there. Most critically, it needs Sweden, its protecting power, to assist three currently detained Americans in North Korea, on the rare occasions when Kim's government allows consular access.
Any isolation campaign will have only marginal diplomatic and economic effect without the participation of North Korea's most powerful partners, China and Russia. Both support more dialogue with the North, not more diplomatic sanctions.
Even if only smaller countries follow America's advice, the U.S. could lose potential go-betweens, such as Vietnam and Mongolia, which have constructive relations with the U.S. and North Korea.
"If they left, I would be worried I was losing a source of information and a more neutral voice that the North Koreans might actually listen to," said Frank Jannuzi, a former Senate staff specialist on Asia.

Microsoft Fine-Tunes Windows 10 and Debuts Beta Eye Control As the date for the next big Windows 10 update approaches, Microsoft today released its latest developer preview, which includes a beta version of a new eye control system. Borne out of a Microsoft hackathon challenge inspired by former NFL player Steve Gleason, who suffers from ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Eye Control enables disabled users with compatible eye tracker devices to operate Windows 10 PCs through gaze alone. The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, expected to arrive next month, will bring several improvements to the Microsoft Edge browser and will also update the default colors in the Windows Console for the first time in more than 20 years. The color changes are aimed at making text easier to see and read on today's high-contrast screens. 'Liberating' Technology Available in beta through the Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 16257 released today, Eye Control lets users with limited mobility type, control a mouse and convert text to speech with compatible eye tracker accessories. The first such device to support those capabilities is the Tobii Eye Tracker 4C, announced yesterday by Tobii, a Sweden-based company that specializes in assistive technology. "This collaboration clearly shows the value of eye gaze input and is a big step forward on the long-term journey to drive high-volume adoption of eye tracking," Tobii CEO Henrik Eskilsson said yesterday in a statement. Microsoft began working with partners in the ALS and motor neuron disease (MND) community during its first hackathon three years ago, following a challenge by Gleason. Gleason had sent an email to Microsoft asking the company to develop a technology that would make it easier for them and others like them to control a wheelchair and communicate. That challenge led to the concept of an Eye Gaze Wheelchair, which won the 2014 hackathon grand prize. Since then, Microsoft has continued to further refine its eye-tracking technology for use with PCs. "Having Eye Control in Windows 10 continues to bridge the gap between widely used technology and people with disabilities," Gleason said in a post published yesterday on the Microsoft Accessibility Blog. "It's simply liberating." More Modern Console Colors Another change coming with the Fall Creators Update is an overhaul of the default colors that appear in the Windows Console. The new palette aims to make it easier to read text, especially in darker colors, and to "give the Console a more modern look & feel," project manager Craig Loewen wrote yesterday on the Microsoft Developer Blog. "During the past 20 years, screens & display technology, contrast ratio, and resolution have changed significantly, from CRT's through TFT LCDs to modern-day nano-scale 4K displays," Loewen said. "The legacy default scheme was not built for modern displays and does not render as well on newer high-contrast LCD displays. This is particularly apparent with deeply saturated darker colors like blue." For now, the new colors will not appear in the Windows Console default option. Microsoft plans to release a tool soon that will let developers try out the new color scheme, they said. Other changes arriving with today's Insider preview include a refreshed browser frame look for Microsoft Edge, several fixes to the anti-virus Windows Defender Application Guard, and the elimination of a number of other bugs in previous builds. In addition, Developer Insiders who are in the Office Insider program will see new support for using 3D images in Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Image credit: Product shots by Microsoft.

Jack Lumber: Posted: 2017-08-08 @ 1:06pm PT Well it's no longer competition between Microsoft and Apple. It's WAR !!! Now that Jobs is dead, the leaders and dev folks at Apple are no longer real software developers and no longer offer actual software that serves its users and Apple community.
As Microsoft rolls out its Xmarin and .Net Core -- allowing developers to create software that will run on iOS -- and Apple and its lame software cannot compete unless they are keeping its iOS private and not public -- Apple is losing its market to better software from Microsoft.
I downloaded the new version of iTunes on my Windows 10 development computer. iTunes 3.3 unlike 3.2 has a purposeful virus. Destroy with Windows 10 OS on all Windows users.
If the virus detects any Xmarin or MS .Net CORE development installation, then iTunes destroys the Windows 10 OS. After the restart for iTunes you computer will not reboot. You get a WHITE SCREEN and it never reboots. By this time your Windows 10 OS is toast, it forces you to go back to the previous Windows 10 and therefore all the Visual Studio Community special upgrades are lost. VS will not run on the previous Windows version and your current Windows version will never reboot again !!!!!!
It's about 3 days work to recover the current Win 10 OS and re-download all the .NET CORE and Xmarin and TFS and VS so the reinstalled Win OS has all the community 2017 features installed and running in the OS.
Apple is going down and they are getting ugly as they fail. Be aware. I have never had this issue with iTunes before. But I will never allow iTunes, or now ANY Apple company products on my dev PCs, laptops or servers. Especially my own personal computer.
iTunes is Apple's most used software and that is why they put the "Microsoft Killer" code in iTunes now. Be Aware. Apple is going down like a Boxer in the ring that is losing and chose to hit below the belt.
It is no longer civilized competition -- it is corporate WAR. Be Aware !!!!!! David Stump: Posted: 2017-08-06 @ 12:54am PT Please give us the old blue colour back on the Windows
Console default option, the white on grey is hard to read partiality for those of us who are colour-blind.
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — The first law enforcement officer in the U.S. ever to be charged with a terrorism offense is again scheduled for trial.
Jury selection begins Monday afternoon in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, in the case against Nicholas Young, who was a police officer in the region's Metro system when they were arrested last year in a government sting.
Prosecutors say Young bought nearly $250 in gift cards they intended for the Islamic State group, giving the cards to an individual who turned out to be an FBI source.
Young's lawyers say the sting amounts to entrapment after their client was under surveillance for six years.
Documents show Young had been under surveillance since 2010.
The trial had been expected to begin last week but was delayed when new evidence emerged.
NEW YORK — Luis Severino struck out 11 in seven overpowering innings, beating longtime Yankees nemesis Dallas Keuchel for the second time this year as New York topped the Houston Astros 5-3 on Wednesday night.
Gary Sanchez snapped an 0-for-19 slump with a two-run single and the Yankees took two of three from the reigning World Series champions this week to win the season series 5-2. Houston defeated New York in the 2017 AL Championship Series, with the home team winning all seven games.
If these budding rivals meet again this year, it will be in October.
Severino (8-1) allowed four hits, including Max Stassi's two-run homer, and walked one in winning their sixth consecutive decision. The ace right-hander, who hasn't lost since April 10 at Boston, threw a five-hitter with 10 strikeouts for their first career complete game in a 4-0 victory over Keuchel at Houston on May 2.
David Robertson struck out two in a scoreless eighth and Aroldis Chapman got three outs for their 12th save in 13 chances. Stassi, subbing for injured catcher Brian McCann, hit an RBI double with two outs in the ninth before Chapman fanned George Springer to end it.
After dominating the Yankees for years, Keuchel (3-7) dropped their third straight start against them — including the playoffs. The left-hander gave up four runs and seven hits in five-plus innings.
Keuchel entered 6-4 with a 1.82 ERA and two complete games in 10 outings against New York, including three post-season starts.
The 2015 AL Cy Young Award winner walked two batters in the first inning, and centre fielder Jake Marisnick made a diving catch on a sacrifice fly by slumping slugger Giancarlo Stanton.
Sanchez rolled a two-run single through an open right side with two outs in the fifth to put the Yankees ahead 3-2.
Gleyber Torres doubled to start the sixth and scored from third on Didi Gregorius' single through a drawn-in infield that chased Keuchel. Aaron Hicks looped an RBI double off Collin McHugh later in the inning that got past a diving Marwin Gonzalez in left field.
The Latest on a man accused of buying high-powered rifles used in the San Bernardino terror attack agreeing to plead guilty to federal criminal charges (all times local):
4:45 p.m.
A California woman whose boyfriend was among those killed in the terror attack in San Bernardino says a plea agreement for a man accused of buying the high-powered rifles used in the shooting brings mixed emotions.
Court papers released Tuesday say 25-year-old Enrique Marquez Jr. agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and lying when they purchased two rifles used in the 2015 attack.
Mandy Pifer's boyfriend, Shannon Johnson, was among 14 people killed in the attack at the Inland Regional Center.
Pifer said she's relieved the case against Marquez won't drag out with a long trial but nothing will bring their boyfriend back. She's planning to speak at Marquez's sentencing.
———
3 p.m.
Court records say a man accused of buying high-powered rifles used in the San Bernardino terror attack has agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.
The documents released Tuesday say Enrique Marquez Jr. has agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and one other charge.
Prosecutors say Marquez acknowledged plotting with Syed Rizwan Farook in 2011 and 2012 to massacre college students and gun down motorists on a gridlocked freeway. Those attacks never occurred.
Authorities said Marquez purchased the guns used by Farook and their wife, Tashfeen Malik, in the Dec. 2, 2015, attack in which 14 people were killed at a public health agency event before the suspects died in a gunfight with police.
Anti-Trump gunman attacks US lawmakers, dies in shootout
Alexandria, United States | AFP | A rifle-wielding critic of President Donald Trump opened fire Wednesday on US lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game, seriously wounding a top Republican member of congress and three others before they were killed by police.
The 66-year-old gunman was identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, an ardent supporter of liberal Senator Bernie Sanders — who said they were “sickened” by the “despicable act.”
In a national address, Trump appealed for unity following the morning assault in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, which came amid bitterly partisan political tension in the US capital in the aftermath of a vitriol-filled 2016 election.
“We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” said the president.
Congressman Steve Scalise — the number three Republican in the House of Representatives and a strong supporter of US gun rights — underwent surgery after being shot in the left hip.
They remain in critical condition following initial surgery and blood transfusions, MedStar Washington Hospital Center said in an update late Wednesday.
“The bullet traveled across their pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding,” a statement said.
“He will require additional operations.”
Three others were shot and injured: a congressional aide, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods, and a US Capitol Police officer.
A second Capitol police officer suffered non-gunshot injuries, the FBI said. Two members of congress said they had sustained minor injuries while trying to take cover.
Trump described Scalise as a “very good friend” and “patriot,” telling him: “America is praying for you and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting.”
They and First Lady Melania Trump later visited Scalise in hospital, bringing flowers.
The FBI said it had recovered and was attempting to trace two weapons, a rifle and a handgun, and was actively investigating Hodgkinson's “associates, whereabouts, social media impressions, and potential motivations.”
According to their Facebook page, Hodgkinson was a fervent supporter of Sanders, the feisty independent who battled Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.
Hodgkinson's social media posts displayed strong anti-Trump sentiment.
“I know they aren't happy with the way things were going, the election results and stuff,” their brother, Michael Hodgkinson, told The New York Times. But they said news of the shooting came “totally out of the blue.”
Sanders swiftly responded to report the suspect had volunteered on their presidential campaign.
“I am sickened by this despicable act,” they said.
“Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms.”
– ‘Run, he's got a gun' –
All Wednesday House votes were canceled, but the annual congressional baseball game will go on as planned at Nationals Park.
“It will be play ball tomorrow night at 7:05,” Congressman Joe Barton, manager of the Republican team, said at a news conference with Mike Doyle, the Democratic team manager.
Doyle put their hand on Barton's shoulder several times as the Republican, who was at the practice with their son, recalled the horror of realizing that friends and co-workers were under attack.
“You know, it shouldn't take an incident like this to bring us together,” Doyle said, as Barton acknowledged that the present day highly-charged political atmosphere has widened the gap between parties on Capitol Hill.
After an all-members briefing where Democrats and Republicans held hands and prayed, House Speaker Paul Ryan and top Democrat Nancy Pelosi addressed the somber chamber and proclaimed lawmakers were “united.”
The shooting took place just after 7:00 am (1100 GMT) as the Republican team practiced for the well-loved charity showdown.
Congressman Rodney Davis told CNN they were at the plate at the time, and Scalise was in the field at second base.
“I was batting, we heard a loud noise…. The next thing I remember was somebody on the field yelling, ‘Run, he's got a gun.'”
Alexandria police chief Michael Brown said their officers arrived within minutes and engaged Hodgkinson, together with Capitol Police officers. The gunman was taken into custody and later died of their injuries.
Lawmaker Jeff Duncan said they were leaving the practice when they were approached by a man they later learned was the shooter, who asked if the team was Republican or Democrat before heading toward the field.
“I'm shaken up,” Duncan said. “My colleagues were targeted today by someone that wanted to kill them.”
– Gun rights advocate –
Barton had arrived at the US Capitol still wearing their red baseball uniform.
“The heroes are the police officers who attacked the shooter, and in doing so quite probably saved many, many lives.”
Scalise's office said the 51-year-old was “in good spirits” before entering surgery, although the hospital later updated their status to critical.
The conservative from the southern state of Louisiana is a firm supporter of US gun rights. Last month they introduced legislation that relaxes restrictions on interstate gun sales.
Several Democrats were practicing at a different field when they heard the news, and immediately gathered to pray for their wounded colleague.
Democrat Nanette Barragan said it will be “bittersweet” when they take the field for their first congressional baseball game — under tightened security.
“We're going to look over our shoulder a little bit,” they said.

BARBERTON, Ohio (AP) — Authorities say an Ohio woman shot their husband multiple times earlier this year and dismembered their body.
Forty-nine-year-old Marcia Eubank has been charged with murder in the death of 54-year-old Howard Eubank. Records don't show an attorney for them
The Summit County sheriff's office says in a release that deputies went to the couple's home in Coventry Township in suburban Akron on Saturday when the couple's adult son called about possible remains. The deputies found deteriorating remains tentatively identified as those of Howard Eubank. The release says investigators believe Eubank was killed earlier this year in a "domestic-related incident."
Authorities say Marcia Eubank was arrested later Saturday in a store parking lot. A Barberton Municipal Court judge on Monday set bond for them at $1 million.
Many industries have adopted blockchain technology as a core part of their operations. It creates transparency and trust between parties so that trust is no longer needed, which is why industries such as real estate, finance, and advertising are beginning to use it. And now, Wikipedia's cofounder Larry Sanger wants blockchain to replace the free online encyclopedia.
TechRepublic's Dan Patterson met with Sanger to discuss why they joined Everipedia, and why the blockchain should replace Wikipedia.
Everipediais the encyclopedia of everything, where topics are unrestricted, unlike on Wikipedia, Sanger said. More technically, it's a blockchain encyclopedia with a decentralized protocol for accessing and sharing knowledge.
SEE: Cheat sheet: Blockchain
A blockchain is a list of transactions, or a ledger, that can be used to represent a database. By putting all of Everipedia's content on the blockchain, it creates a transparency between writers and readers. When it's all set up, it will be possible for people to propose adding information to the blockchain, Sanger explained, and people who have tokens (which are earned by adding to the blockchain) come to a consensus about what information gets added to the blockchain.
"In terms of editorial standards, just to get on an encyclopedia blockchain will be relatively easy," Sanger said. When the initial protocol is adopted, it should be a very low bar that allows encyclopedia articles to get onto the blockchain, they said. However, the actual editorial decisions that are made won't happen on that level.
Different users of the information that make up the blockchain and Everipedia will make the decisions on the ratings of articles, and what order they will be placed. Users will be able to go in, read those articles, and visit our interface to submit their own ratings, they said.

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – Hart Island, a massive burial ground near the Bronx, is eroding, unearthing human skeletons along the shoreline.
Advocates say the city hasn't done anything – until now.
“Skeletal remains are literally just coming out of the earth,” Melinda Hunt, of the Hart Island Project, told CBS2's Natalie Duddridge.
On Monday, 174 exposed bones were recovered from Hart Island cemetery. It's a giant potter's field where the East River meets Long Island Sound.
More than one million unclaimed New Yorkers, with no family or money, are buried there, even infants.
But years of storms have eroded the island's shores, unearthing graves.
“Entire skeletons are sort of falling out of the hill onto the beach, and then they're washed away with the tide,” Hunt said.
Hunt has been monitoring the situation since the 1990s, demanding the Department of Corrections, which runs the island, do something.
“They know that it's happening, because I learned about it from the correction officers, who referred to this area as bones beach,” they said.
Hart Island is only open to visitors by appointment months in advance. So last week, Hunt and a photographer captured pictures from a boat, showing skeletons scattered among the rocks.
Suddenly this week, officials fast-tracked the process.
Video from Chopper 2 shows red flags marking spots archaeologist have found human remains. Once identified, the remains will be re-buried by Rikers Island prisoners.
“Why in the world would an agency that's managing our jails have anything to do with this island?” Council Mark Levine wonders.
Levine wants to transfer control of the island to the Department of Parks and Recreation, so families could freely visit graves of loved ones without an armed guard.
“It's simply wrong that people who are neglected in life, who were marginalized in life in the city are now getting the same treatment in this burial ground,” they said.
Late Tuesday, the corrections department told CBS2 it will begin monthly inspections and will also fast-track reconstruction of the shoreline to stabilize the graves.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave the city $13 million to use toward repairs, which are expected to start in 2019.
NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian ride-hailing service Ola said Tuesday that it's planning to enter the Australian market, its first foray overseas.
The company said it has begun inviting car owners in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Perth to learn more about driving for the service. It plans to start commercial operations in Australia in early 2018.
The Indian app-based ride-hailing company will be in competition with Uber in the Australian market.
Ola, based in India's southern technology hub of Bangalore, was set up in 2011 and along with Uber has become hugely popular as more people have access to smartphones.
The service says it has nearly a million drivers across India and 125 million people use it.
As you might guess, this is intended for servers where capacity takes priority over everything else, including performance (the 500MB/sec is nothing to write home about). A data center could hold 100 petabytes of data in a single rack instead of needing large swaths of server room space. That's helpful for cloud services, AI and other technologies that may need massive amounts of data.
And then there's the cost. When the DC100 ships in the summer, it'll have pricing comparable to other business-grade SSDs "on a per-terabyte basis." That likely means a price in the tens of thousands of dollars, which is enough to give pause even to those companies that can afford it. While the drive should be trustworthy enough, that's a lot of money (and a lot of data) to lose if one goes bad. Think of this more as a peek at the future of SSDs than anything else.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- Taiwanese ultramarathon runner Tommy Chen (陳彥博) won Stage 4 of six in the ultramarathon "Bhutan The Last Secret 200km 2018," but in the process they had to battle though horrific blisters on their heels, which have become excruciatingly painful.
At 7:27 p.m. last night (May 30) a post appeared on Chen's Facebook page announcing that Chen had taken first place in Stage 4 with a time of 4:31:18, while in second place was Guillaume Degoulet of France at 4:49:39 and third place was taken Alan Zaugy, also of France, at 4:57:41.
At the beginning of Stage 4, Chen said that they were already feeling the effects of the altitude and was fatigue, but in order to ensure a high ranking, they felt compelled to catch up with the main group. When they reached the second checkpoint, Chen began to feel heels of their feet stinging with "every step feeling like stepping on needles."
Fearing that if they stopped, the gap between them and lead pack would widen, they pressed on. Despite feeling such intense pain that they "wanted to scream out loud," they kept running at a full sprint.
Finally, when they finished the stage, they found that they had actually taken a 28-minute lead over their closest competitor. When they finally took their socks off, they found that the skin had worn completely off their heels, making even ordinary walking difficult.
Chen said, "When saw my socks, they were covered in blood, many staff members and doctors were all shocked." After being disinfected and treated by a doctor, Chen said their feet are still in pain, so they can only hope now that the wound does not become infected and their injury worsen.
Some things to watch with the Bengals' draft:
OH!-LINE
The offensive line was the biggest factor in Cincinnati's fall to the bottom of the league. The Bengals let left tackle Andrew Whitworth and right guard Kevin Zeitler leave as free agents, and the line fell apart. In this off-season, centre Russell Bodine signed a two-year deal with Buffalo, creating another hole. They've begun addressing the problem through the draft already, trading with the Bills for left tackle Cordy Glenn. The teams swapped first-round picks, with Buffalo moving up to No. 12 and Cincinnati sliding to 21st overall. They need more help in the draft.
ANOTHER QB?
The Bengals took AJ McCarron in the fifth round in 2014, hoping to acquire a reliable backup for Dalton. The move worked well — McCarron took over when Dalton broke the thumb on their passing hand in 2015 and led the Bengals into the playoffs. McCarron left for Buffalo as a free agent, and the Bengals signed Matt Barkley to a two-year deal, but it wouldn't be a surprise if they considered a quarterback in the fifth round again.
LINEBACKER DAZE
Vontaze Burfict is suspended for the first four games of the season — the third year in a row that he's serving punishment from the NFL. As long as he's around, there will be a need for depth at that position. Burfict has missed the start of each of the past four seasons because of injury or suspensions.
HITS, MISSES AND BARGAINS
The Bengals haven't gotten much from the offensive players taken in the opening rounds the past three years. They chose offensive tackles Cedric Ogbuehi and Jake Fisher in the first two rounds in 2015. Ogbuehi has struggled to keep a spot, and Fisher had a procedure for an irregular heartbeat last year. Receiver Tyler Boyd — a second-round pick in 2016 — managed only 22 caches in 10 games in 2017. Last year, Ross had shoulder surgery that limited them at the start of training camp and wound up with only one carry — they fumbled — and no receptions before another shoulder injury ended their season. Mixon started seven games and finished with 626 yards and a 3.5-yard average.

CCT acquits Saraki of false assets declaration charge
Senate President Bukola Saraki was yesterday at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) cleared of the false assets declaration charge preferred against him.
Upholding Saraki's “no-case submission”, the tribunal said the prosecution failed to discharge the burden of proof placed on it under the law.
In a unanimous ruling, the two-man tribunal held that the defence discredited the prosecution's evidence during cross-examination.
In their lead ruling, CCT Chairman Justice Danladi Yakubu Umar said the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against Saraki to warrant theirs being called to defend himself.
Umar faulted the evidence of the third prosecution witness, Samuel Madojemu (Head of Investigation at the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB) that they received oral instructions to join a team from other agencies to investigate Saraki.
In a swift reaction, Sarki described their acquittal as a vindication.
Madojemu's evidence that the report of the investigation team comprising men of the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC), Department of State Services (DSS) and CCB was made orally could not be relied upon to sustain the charges against Saraki, the tribunal chairperson said.
Such a team of investigators, Umar declared, was not known to law.
They said Madojemu was unhelpful to the prosecution when they (Madojemu) claimed that all information in the affidavit in support of the 18-count charge was based on information supplied to them by an undisclosed team of investigators.
Umar said what the EFCC tendered before the tribunal was more of a product of intelligence gathering than of conventional investigation.
According to him, it is wrong of the investigators not to have invited the defendant to make a statement so that the truth can be unearthed as it relates to the allegations against them and the discrepancies noticed in their assets declaration forms.
Umar said: “From the simple analysis of the evidence of the prosecution, we find it difficult to accept the seriousness of the witnesses. All the evidence was so discredited, unreliable that no reasonable court will attach probate value to them.
“Since the essential ingredients of all the charges were not proved as required by law, this tribunal has no option to discharge and acquit the defendant in view of the manifestly unreliable evidence of the prosecution witnesses.”
Concurring with the ruling, the tribunal's sole member, Williams Atedze Agwadza, said: “The formulation of the 18-count charge was based on the affidavit-evidence of Mr. Madojemu of the CCB.
“His testimony and affidavit evidence later became an affliction and an epidemic that befell the prosecution because they were based on mere hearsays”
Agwadza said Madojemu's affidavit-evidence was inadmissble under Sections 37, 38 and 126 of the Evidence Act.
They said the team referred to by Madojemu comprising operatives of the EFCC, DSS and CCB is unknown to law.
They added that the team has no constitutional or statutory backing to have done what it did.
The prosecution, Agwadza said, failed to produce material evidence including the defendant's statement and the original copies of their assets declaration forms.
They noted: “Evidence to establish an offence must be such that has probate value. Another fatal error on the part of the complainant was the failure to obtain the statement of the defendant.”
The prosecution, they said, failed to call vital witnesses to “effectively link the defendant to the offences charged”.
Agwadza noted that while the prosecution alleged that Saraki was earning salary from the Kwara State government even as a Senator, it (prosecution) failed to call the state's Accountant-General to prove that allegation.
In criminal prosecution, they said, the onus was on the prosecution to prove its case, adding that where it fails in that duty, the defence could not be called to prove its innocence.
“My humble conclusion is that the defendant in this case has no case to answer and they are accordingly discharged and acquitted,” Agwadza said.

• Italy is confronting a political crisis, one that could mean big trouble for the world economy.
Our economics columnist lays out the stakes: Italy has the fourth-largest economy in Europe and one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.
In Rome, Italy's populist parties continued their efforts to form a government.
Meanwhile, next up to test Europe's stability is Spain, where a corruption scandal has damaged the prime minister's party and spurred calls for their ouster.
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Concrete barriers and chain-link fencing are going up around the site of the Super Bowl in downtown Minneapolis, where a contingent of local, state and national agencies is working to ensure that the game and dozens of related events are safe.
The downtown location of the Feb. 4 title game has presented challenges for authorities, who have had to get creative as they carved a secure perimeter around businesses and a major hospital near U.S. Bank Stadium. But it's not the first time the Super Bowl has dealt with the challenges of a city center, and authorities who have spent roughly two years thinking about every possible scenario say they are prepared.
"We're ready for anything that may come our way," Minneapolis Police Commander Scott Gerlicher said. "It's about not just feeling safe, but making sure people are in fact safe."
Gerlicher, whose department is overseeing security, said this Super Bowl will have the largest deployment of federal resources yet. That's because Minneapolis has a relatively small department — less than 900 officers compared with the roughly 5,000 in Houston, where last year's game was held — and needed more personnel.
Dozens of other cities are sending officers too, and the Minnesota National Guard has been activated. An additional 10,000 volunteers are being trained to spot suspicious activity.
Visitors can expect to see increased police patrols, bomb-sniffing dogs, helicopters, officers in tactical gear, and that chain-link and concrete fence around U.S. Bank Stadium.
Plenty of technology such as motion detectors, closed-circuit cameras and air particle sensors will be operating behind the scenes. Giant machines are being used to scan shipments to the stadium. Extra security cameras will be sprinkled around the city, and NFL-sanctioned events will have metal detectors. Teams will be in place to react to whatever comes up.
"Our efforts are to make sure that it's a warm and inviting atmosphere. But make no mistake about it — there are tons of watchful eyes from the law enforcement and public safety sectors," said Alex Khu, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Minnesota and the federal coordinator for this year's Super Bowl.
Because of the dense area around the stadium, some security screening will be happening off-site. They also had to figure out how to secure Super Bowl Live, a largely free-flowing, 10-day outdoor event that's open to the public. Meanwhile, some events are being held in nearby St. Paul and at the Mall of America in Bloomington, while team hotels, practice facilities — and transportation to and from — also must be secured.
Jeffrey Miller, former senior vice president and chief security officer for the NFL, said each host city faces different challenges. In Minneapolis, perhaps the biggest is the weather. They said security staff may need to be doubled or tripled to keep people from being exposed to dangerous elements for a prolonged time.
"That's a challenge, and it's a costly one you don't have if playing in San Diego," they said.
Miller said setting up a perimeter around a downtown venue is more difficult than setting one up around a stadium surrounded by parking lots. Architects, engineers and other experts are part of the planning. For fans, they said, there are advantages to being downtown and close to the action.
"The NFL is really good at trying to balance security needs with the fan engagement part of the equation," they said.
Miller said officials also have to take into account recent world events — meaning the possibility of a terror attack.
Joe Rivers, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI in Minneapolis, said a threat assessment for the game has included analyzing attacks around the world. They cited the May bombing of an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, the Oct. 1 shooting at an outdoor concert in Las Vegas and the Oct. 31 vehicle attack on a New York City bike path. Without providing detail, Rivers said authorities used those attacks to shape their plans.
Local history must also be considered. Minneapolis has seen dozens of young men travel to Somalia or Syria to join extremist groups over the past decade. There also has been a stabbing attack at a central Minnesota mall and a more recent bombing of a local mosque.
"It's impossible for us to ignore the historical cases that we've had here and the type of threats ... that we've addressed," Rivers said.
They said there is no credible threat to the Super Bowl, and authorities are continuing to gather intelligence. Rivers said their main concerns are low-tech threats, such as someone driving a vehicle into or firing a weapon at a crowd.
"Not to alarm anyone, but it's not hard to come by weapons in this country and with where our venues are located and things like that, there's no way we can possibly secure every single floor of every single building that can see a venue or can overlook a crowd, so those are concerns, yes," they said.
Fans attending Super Bowl events can help by staying vigilant. In addition to calling 911, people who see something suspicious can call 1-800-CALL-FBI. In the event of something like the Boston Marathon bombing, the FBI has created a website where witnesses can upload videos and photos so the FBI can gather evidence quickly.
"Obviously, the best case scenario is that we hope that we do all of this ... and no one never even realizes all the legwork that went into it on the front end," Rivers said. "They just show up, have a good time, and leave and go home."

The game is from the one-man studio Wizard Fu and is the brainchild of Nathanael Weiss. It's described as a love letter to the RPGs of old. Players control Roq, who travels to different planets on their spaceship. One day, they wake up on a strange planet with their robot companion Jib at their side (Jib is playable by a local second controller). They have to figure out why he's on this planet, and in the process, they manage to awaken an evil ancient army.
Songbringer features real-time combat, powerups, online leaderboards and item crafting. If you've been itching to play an old-school RPG, it sounds like this game is just the ticket.
Boston Tea Party is believed to be the first coffee chain in the UK to implement a complete ban on single-use plastic cups.
The independently-owned company, which has 21 branches across the Midlands and the South West, said the ban will come into effect on 1st June 2018.
Customers will be able to bring their own reusable cups, buy cups at the cafes at a subsidised rate or grab a loan cup, for which a deposit would have to be paid which would be refunded upon return to any of its outlets.
The coffee chain currently gives away around 340,000 takeaway hot drinks a year. Customers were previously offered a 25p discount on drinks if they used their own cup but only 2.8% of people took up the offer.
In the UK, only one in 400 of the estimated 2.5 billion plastic coated coffee cups are said to be recycled.
Sam Roberts, Owner and MD of Boston Tea Party said: “Lots of coffee chains are making pledges about how they plan to tackle cup waste in the future. But theirs is a future which is too far away. We need to stop right now.”
Bishop confirms over 100 adults in Fort Wayne, South Bend Jill Boughton Freelance Writer
“When they are anointed with chrism in Confirmation, they will be drawn more deeply into God's life and love, into the life and love of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,” Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades told worshippers gathered at St. Matthew Cathedral, South Bend, of the about 75 adults gathered on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity, May 27 — as they had assured those accompanying around 34 candidates the previous evening at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Fort Wayne.
Although we cannot fully understand the mystery of the Trinity, they said, it is a mystery we believe because it was revealed to us by Jesus.
“Jesus, the eternal Son, revealed to us the Father and the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel today, Jesus instructed the disciples to go and make disciples of all nations and to baptize them in the name of the Trinity, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Though, as I mentioned, the mystery of the Trinity infinitely transcends us, it is also the reality closest to us, because God is the very source of our being and we received a share in Their divine nature when we were baptized. The Holy Trinity made Their dwelling within us. We received a spirit of adoption, as St. Paul wrote to the Romans … As children of God, we can call God ‘Abba,' Father. When we were baptized in the name of the Holy Trinity, we became adopted children of God. We were united to Christ the Son and received Their new life. And we became temples of the Holy Spirit. The love of God was poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that was given to us.”
The candidates had chosen patron saints as their confirmation names, they continued. The saints teach that the true treasure of life is living in the love of the Blessed Trinity and never losing this love.
“With the gifts of the Holy Spirit they will receive in the sacrament of Confirmation, our brothers and sisters will be strengthened to live in the Father's love as faithful disciples of Their Son, Jesus. They will receive an increase and deepening of baptismal grace and become more deeply rooted in their Christian identity as sons and daughters of God the Father and more firmly united to Christ the Son and to Their Church.”
Lori Massa, RCIA director at St. Vincent de Paul Parish, Elkhart, accompanied 24 of their parishioners who were being confirmed at St. Matthew. They explained that parents often approach the parish seeking baptism for their young children. During that interview, they may learn that the parents have never been confirmed. Often, they also desire a sacramental marriage. The parish tries to be thorough in preparing people for these sacraments, but also accommodating of irregular work schedules.
When a bilingual RCIA was proved burdensome for the Spanish speakers, St. Vincent was able to offer instruction in Spanish. Olga and Gilberto Aceves were among the couples who have been able to celebrate both sacraments this year. Of course, among the over 100 candidates confirmed at the two Masses there were 100 different motivations, but each candidate was drawn to a closer relationship with Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit.

Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills rose in Monday's auction to their highest levels since August 2008.
The Treasury Department auctioned $51 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 1.780 percent, up from 1.670 percent last week. Another $45 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 1.950 percent, up from 1.850 percent last week.
The three-month rate was the highest since those bills averaged 1.850 percent on Aug. 18, 2008. The six-month rate was the highest since those bills averaged 1.980 percent also on Aug. 18, 2008.
The discount rates reflect that the bills sell for less than face value. For a $10,000 bill, the three-month price was $9,955.00 while a six-month bill sold for $9,901.42. That would equal an annualized rate of 1.813 percent for the three-month bills and 1.997 percent for the six-month bills.
Separately, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, edged up to 2.08 percent Friday, up from 2.05 percent at the beginning of last week on March 12.
The German Football Association (DFB) have submitted their bid book to UEFA as preparations as part of their bid to host the 2024 European Championships.
DFB President Reinhard Grindel, accompanied by the governing body's general secretary Friedrich Curtius, and bid ambassador Philipp Lahm, Germany's 2014 FIFA World Cup-winning captain led the delegation.
They were joined the DFB's ambassador for integration Celia Šašić, a player for the German women's team, as the bid book was officially to to UEFA general secretary Theodore Theodoridis during a special ceremony.
The submission comes three days before the April 27 deadline and will be followed by the bid book from Turkey - the only other nation bidding to host Euro 2024.
"We are submitting an excellent bid concept for a perfectly organised tournament, which offers a great opportunity for UEFA to further develop European football," Grindel said.

In a subtle dig at the Turkish bid, Grindel added: “Euro 2024 staged in the heart of Europe will enable all of the participants to be given the best possible support by their fans.
"At the same time, we are building bridges between people of different nations, and are making an important contribution to bringing alive both the values of football and those of a modern civil society."
Once Turkey submits their bid later this week, UEFA will start evaluating the dossiers.
"During this evaluation phase, bidders may be required by UEFA to elaborate upon and substantiate their bids as described in their bid dossiers," a UEFA statement read.
UEFA will then publish a written evaluation on each bid with the host nation set to be announced on September 27.

SON boosts export of Nigerians agric products
The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) is set to boost exports of Nigerian products through the avenue of standardisation.
This is the agency has started doing through the staff certification programme recently held in Lagos.
Determined to raise the quality profile of Nigerian made products, especially agricultural products some of which had been banned, the agency said there was need to first build the capacity of its workforce as a starting point.
It said Nigerian had huge potentials in the area of agriculture and that the agency was poised to help boost export of Nigeria agriculture products, right from the farms through the entire value chain.
The agency is doing this well aware of the challenges of processing of these products, and the fact that input such as fertiliser are also expensive to procure.
The SON would issue certificates for such products, which would make them acceptable, not only in Nigeria, but also throughout the world after the accreditation, especially using the MANCAP scheme.
The latest move is in line with the implementation of ISO 1705.
The SON Director-General, Mr Osita Aboloma, said the training had become important to ensure accreditation of the products and enhance the acceptability globally.
They emphasised the need to inculcate in Nigerian manufacturers, the culture of good entrepreneurship so that doing business regionally and globally becomes easy for them.
“After this training, some of such products have to be certified. SON is already very effective in MANCAP, and the SON has taken steps to ensure the MANCAP certification effective. The certificate would not only be acceptable at home but also throughout the whole world”.
Reiterating that Nigeria could not have an effective manufacturing sector without quality assurance, they added that the SON would be available to mentor manufacturers in terms of what and what to bring into their processes
The SON DG said the activities of their agency, in addition to ensuring safety of lives and property, also aims at conserving resources usually wasted in patronising substandard products.
This they said is why it had become very necessary to ascertain the propriety or otherwise of things being shipped into the count, saying amongst others, it would protect the local manufacturing environment from unfair habits.
According to him, this would mean a win-win situation for stakeholders for the nation and for its global partners, observing that it would raise global and domestic confidence level on Nigerian products and processes.
Mr Malik Shekar, Chief Technical Adviser to UNIDO expressed commitment of the current leadership of SON, under Osita Aboloma taking the organisation to a greater height will not be farfetched.
“He is putting their zeal on accreditation of more laboratories and more emphasis on manpower development and this is a good step in the right direction,” they said.
The UNIDO Chief noted that at the completion of the staff certification, the organisation's certification would be acceptable not only in Nigeria but through out the world
“This is in line with the ISO 1705, it is key to penetrate the export market. SON would be integrated into the global network and all over the world, people want to know or see the test certificate and competence behind it,” they said.
“In trade agreement, both parties engaged in trade would only know if a product would meet your expectations, it is simply by looking at the test certificate, the lab that conducted the test and if the certification is integrated in the global network? In other words, with the accreditation infrastructure in place, there would be more confidence on any issued certificate,” they added.
They recalled that SON Food and Chemistry Accredited Laboratories had been recently recertified and have large scope to test agriculture products.

Transcript for Candace Cameron Bure on one of their 'hardest days' at 'The View'
This transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.
Recent revelations regarding the censure and resignation of Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority board member Bill Hodgson have created more questions than answers. Earlier this week, our sister paper Niagara This Week obtained a copy of a redacted version of a confidential report done by legal firm Gowling WLG which led to Hodgson's departure from the NPCA in 2017.
Hodgson, a regional councillor for Lincoln, had been accused of undermining the process involved in hiring a company to conduct an operational review of the authority. The NPCA ordered the review after months of criticism.
Someone at a firm known to Hodgson (the name was redacted in the leaked report) emailed them to express an interest in bidding on the contract. Hodgson replied in an email that said: “Thanks for your interest in the process to undertake an operational review at the NPCA.” They said they would be “pleased” to forward the email to then-acting NPCA CAO Peter Graham who was in charge of the process
Hodgson's email apparently set off alarm bells and the Gowling firm was hired. The resulting report said the NPCA board could “reasonably conclude” a breach of their code of conduct had been committed. On April 27, 2017 the board censured Hodgson and scrapped the hiring process. Hodgson resigned.
Hodgson, who got their first look at a redacted version of the report this week, said he's mystified as to what could have led to a finding of misconduct. “From what I have seen so far, it is a legal opinion that draws conclusions on inaccurate and incomplete information,” said Hodgson. In voting to conduct the operational review NPCA board members had promised to stay clear of all parts of the process. But did Hodgson's decision to politely reply to an email violate that promise and undermine the process? Mark Brickell, then a senior staffer who later succeeded Graham as CAO, seems to have thought.
Hodgson said their action was “spun into something that it is not … Others can explain the motivations that lay behind the failure to look at this from a best-practices perspective.”
Were there other motives as Hodgson hints? It's hard to say without more information, including explanations from NPCA and release of the Gowling report. But NPCA spokespersons remain tight-lipped and, as usual of late, have not responded to requests for comment.
As to the full report, The Standard put in Freedom of Information request which the NPCA received on Dec. 7 last year. On Jan. 5, the conservation authority denied our request for the report because “the report would be published online and made available to the public at-large within 90 days.”
On Friday, the NPCA changed its mind, revising its decision and denying The Standard's request entirely. Its reasoning was the report provides legal advice to NPCA board chair Sandy Annunziata and is subject to solicitor/client privilege. Why the change from Jan. 5 to Feb. 2? Who knows, but all that's changed over the past month is a redacted version of the report was obtained and reported upon by the media.
What this all comes down to is the public still has not been provided with a satisfactory explanation of the Hodgson censure and the NPCA apparently wants to keep it that way.
From what we've seen so far, Hodgson did nothing to warrant censure. What was they supposed to have done with the email?
The NPCA has an obligation to release the unredacted report to shed light on this murky situation and prove its action taken against a long-serving politician and public servant was justified.
Rivers advocates fiscal federalism
By Jimitota Onoyume
PORT HAR-COURT— Rivers State Government has re- echoed its demand for fiscal federalism, saying that it will strengthen the economy of the country as all sections will develop based on their comparative advantages.
Governor Nyesom Wike of the state, who spoke at a state banquet in Government House, Port Harcourt for the Ambassador of the United States to Nigeria, Mr William Symington, urged the United States to also set up a Visa office in Port Harcourt to cater for the region.
The governor said that the state was safe for investors, stressing that their government will continue to create the right atmosphere for business to thrive.
Their words: “We are clamouring for true federalism. When you talk of true federalism, they think you don't want to be part of the country. We talk about true federalism as practised in America. We demand a true presidential system where all the federating units will be allowed to enjoy their resources and contribute to the centre.
“That means we believe that there must be a country called Nigeria. All of us will work together for the unity of the country.”
“Forget about the media propaganda. This state is an opposition state. Therefore, don't expect them to say it is the best. But, we are the best state. We are doing everything to ensure that investors do profitable business under the ambit of the law.”

A zero-tolerance approach to benefit fraud has seen £140,000 recovered from residents in Preston.
Preston Council bosses say the clawed back funds will be essential as they “strive to do more for less” in the wake of significant funding cuts.
Officers also recovered four social housing properties not being used as the tenants' principal home during the last financial year.
The figures have been released as part of a counter-fraud report set to be discussed by the council's audit committee this week.
Officers found £140,876 worth of over-payments caused by fraudulent claims or residents not reporting changes in circumstances affecting their benefits.
A council spokesperson said: “The Government's austerity programme has led to a substantial reduction in funding and this means that as a council we must strive to do more for less.
“It is vital that we ensure our limited funds are directed towards the provision of essential services and that we minimise our losses to fraud.
"Preston City Council has a duty to safeguard public funds and therefore has adopted a zero tolerance approach to fraud.
“As such, we have a Corporate Inquiry Team, which works closely with the police and other agencies to prevent, detect and deter fraud against the council and its partners.”
The overpayments consisted of council tax reduction scheme funds totalling £34,940, council tax benefit of £3,089, housing benefit of £45,668, council tax of £55,726 and business rates of £1,452.
A council spokesperson added: “It is in the public interest that we investigate all levels of fraud against the council and take firm action against offenders. If you have any suspicions of fraudulent action, please get in touch with the council using our fraud hotline 01772 906316 or e-mail fraud@preston.gov.uk.”
Limerick were lifeless, laments Daly 17 April 2017
Anthony Daly
Anthony Daly has criticised Limerick's performance in their 10-point defeat to Galway.
The two-time All-Ireland winning Clare captain, who coaches the Limerick minors, laments the lack of fight shown by John Kiely's side in their Irish Examiner column.
"There was no life in the players, but the most damning indictment of the performance was the lack of intensity they brought to the fight," they wrote.
"After the Limerick minors were narrowly beaten by Tipperary in Thurles 12 days ago, John Mulqueen, our manager, praised the players afterwards for dying with their boots on. We didn't win but we played the Limerick way — with fire and passion and real intensity. And we had a real cut.
"I don't think Limerick can play any other way, but there was none of that yesterday. What summed it up for me was a sideline cut Gearóid Hegarty stood over in the first half. It took them seven seconds before they took the cut because nobody was moving or giving them an option."
Daly's comments are sure to provide plenty of motivation for Limerick ahead of their Munster SHC clash with their native county on June 4.
Driverless New Year: Self-Driving Startups To Watch in 2017
2016 was the year of many things. For the auto and tech industries, it was the year the companies that already placed their bets on self-driving technology began showing their hands.
Auto giants -- some of which were increasingly aware that they were moving into relatively uncharted territory - began buying up or otherwise forging partnerships with tech startups. GM acquired Cruise and partnered with Lyft. Ford acquired Chariot and Israeli machine learning and computer vision startup SAIPS.
As the hype around driverless cars grew, so did the demand for teams with backgrounds in AI and machine learning -- both relatively nascent fields. Even the biggest tech companies, namely Uber, were left wanting.
So, Uber also went on somewhat of a purchasing tear and acquired then six-month-old self-driving trucking startup Otto and put Anthony Levandowski, its co-founder and one of the founders of Google's self-driving project, at the head of all of Uber's autonomous efforts. The ride-hail company then bought out AI startup Geometric Intelligence and tapped its co-founder Gary Marcus to head up Uber's new AI lab.
Investors took notice and also began placing their bets -- if they hadn't already.
Around the same time as the Cruise acquisition -- which was seen as a coup for Silicon Valley -- A16z invested in aftermarket autonomous startup Comma.ai. Shortly after, Andy Rubin's Playground invested in aftermarket car tech startup Nauto. The list goes on.
This demand will likely continue as companies trudge forward in the competition to build and develop self-driving cars. That means investors will be paying attention to startups with the skills to build any aspect of the self-driving stack as some of them increasingly become potential acquisition targets while the others take on the biggest names in transportation.
In no particular order, here is a non-exhaustive list of the startups we'll be watching:
Chris Urmson's Self-Driving Startup
Call it premature, but investors will be keeping a close eye on what the former chief technology officer of Google's self-driving project will be doing. Urmson, who left Google in August, is starting their own autonomous startup, sources told Recode.
We don't know much about the company except that Urmson likely plans on developing the full stack of autonomous hardware and software and then licensing it to automakers.
So how do we know it's worth watching? Well, for investors, the company looks like a win-win. Urmson -- a much sought-after engineering talent themselves -- has already approached big names from companies like Uber, Tesla and Apple.
So at the very least, the yet-to-be-named or -launched company is certainly an acquisition target purely for the talent, if nothing else. But at most, not only does Urmson have the technical know-how, they seem to have a path to market in mind, according to sources. So it could prove to be a worthy investment even as an independent company.
Zoox
Zoox, which recently closed a $200 million round at a $1 billion valuation, is building a fully electric fleet of self-driving vehicles to be used in a ride-hail service. The company has yet to unveil its vehicle or much of its plans but is one of the few startups attempting to build a car from the ground up.
That's a hard problem that even Waymo -- Alphabet's self-driving subsidiary -- and Apple have reportedly decided against pursuing. That's exactly why several sources say the company had difficulty raising its most recent round.
But it's also what makes the company intriguing. However unlikely or difficult it may seem, if Zoox is able to build everything from the vehicle to the self-driving software to the ride-hail platform, it will be the only company to do so without partnering with other players. In 2017, fresh off a new infusion of cash, it's likely the company will have to officially show off some part of its full fledged robot-taxi service.
Drive.ai
Drive.ai recently launched out of stealth with one pitch: The solution to all your self-driving uncertainties is deep learning -- a type of machine learning. The company's co-founder Sameep Tandon insists the startup is the only company using deep learning to power the entire autonomous system.
That means it's powering everything from the sensors and cameras, to the vehicle's decision-making, to the way the car communicates with people and things around it.
The company, which has raised $12 million to date, also launched having already secured a few commercial fleet partnerships for which the company will retrofit their software and hardware stack into vehicles in order to collect, test and verify real-world driving data. Not to mention, its founders - who wouldn't give too many more details about the partnerships - claim to be among the few people with extensive backgrounds in deep learning.
Nuro.ai
Though it was co-founded by Jiajun Zhu and Dave Ferguson - two of the top self-driving engineers from Google's car shop - the robotics and AI startup Nuro.ai won't focus only on transportation.
While the first in its suite of products will be a fully self-driving car -- which the company hopes to launch in the next two to four years -- Nuro also plans to draw from the wide range of machine learning and robotics experience its staffers have to build a series of AI-powered products.
The company, still in semi-stealth mode, has raised some money - though its head of product Michael Hanuschik wouldn't disclose how much. But again, purely based on talent, the company may be worth the attention.
Nuro's team includes engineers with robotics, artificial intelligence and self-driving experience who had a hand in either developing or shipping an unusually wide range of products including Nexus cameras, Google Image search, the Mars Exploration and Curiosity Rovers, Google street view, Google's self-driving cars and a number of surgical tools.
nuTonomy
This MIT spinoff, which has headquarters in Singapore and Massachusetts, has made significant strides that rival its more established competitor, Uber. In a matter of months, the company beat out Uber and other players and was named Singapore's official autonomous research and development partner, it partnered with Uber's Southeast Asian rival Grab and launched a self-driving pilot [seen here] in both Singapore and Massachusetts.
To date, the three-year-old company has raised just under $20 million. NuTonomy is also testing its vehicles in Michigan and in the U.K., where the company said it has a partnership with Jaguar Land Rover.
Varden Labs
Varden Labs is a stealth self-driving company that graduated from startup incubator Y Combinator as part of the Winter 2016 class. The company recently raised $4.5 million in seed funding which was led by Maven Ventures. Notably, both Maven and Y Combinator were investors in Cruise.
There's very little known about the startup, but the site and past coverage of the company focus on developing autonomous technology on the cheap. The co-founders of the company, Michael Skupien and Alex Rodrigues, previously retrofitted golf carts to drive autonomously around the University of Waterloo in 2015 and other college campuses.
"We constructed a self-driving vehicle for public roads faster and cheaper than anyone in history. In an industry filled with a billion dollar titans we are fast, lean and creative," the site reads.
The company expects to launch officially in February and should disclose more details on its plans then.
More Auto-Tech Startups To Watch
These other companies wouldn't qualify as self-driving startups in their current iterations but have ambitions to lend some or all of their capabilities to power autonomous tech: Pearl Auto, Nauto, Driversiti, Quanergy, and Zendrive.

ZICTA, Airtel colluding, Journalist reports to Public Prosecutor
A Lusaka based Journnalist has asked the Public Protector to investigate the Zambia Information, Communication and Technology Authority (ZICTA) for alleged colluding with Airtel Networks.
According to a Press Statement issued by Thomas Allan Zgambo to the Zambian Eye, the complaint was lodged in on Thursday December 7. 2017. Zgambo discloses in a statement that on October 26, 2017 they had a confidential meeting with ZICTA management where they went to discuss a possible criminal prosecution of Airtel Networks.
They say they were surprised that Airtel who were not represented in the meeting wrote to them through lawyer Paulman Chungu. Zgambo said they lodged a complaint with ZICTA but the ZICTA DG has refused to respond to their letter where they demanded that Zicta discloses the name of the person who gave Airtel information. Zgambo says this is a clear sign that ZICTA as a regulator is colluding with Airtel a market player.
Liberia's former President Charles Taylor is currently serving a 50-year sentence for war crimes in a prison in the British city of Durham. But is they using that as a base to interfere in the elections in their homeland next Tuesday?
“If they were to come back today, I'd roll out the red carpet,” said Justin Luther Cassell, a 32-year-old man sitting outside the Pray for Peace Business Centre in Gbartala, central Liberia.
Gathered round on plastic chairs, drinking beer and discussing the forthcoming Liberian elections, the men here are clearly frustrated.
This was Charles Taylor's rebel headquarters in the 1990s.
The former military base may be crumbling, with buildings almost completely engulfed by the jungle, but Taylor's name is still as strong as ever in Bong county.
More than five years since the former president was sentenced for war crimes committed in neighbouring Sierra Leone, people in their heartland are still harking back to the old days.
“Even with the sound of the gun, life was better,” said one frustrated young man, bemoaning the lack of basic necessities in the country.
Football and politics
In an unlikely alliance, former world footballer of the year George Weah, who is running on the presidential ballot for the third time, has chosen Taylor's ex-wife, Jewel Howard Taylor, as their deputy.
Having historically been a staunch critic of Taylor and their National Patriotic Party (NPP), questions are being asked of the motives.
The union between Mr Weah's Congress for Democratic Change (CDC) and the NPP came just before a phone call from the former warlord was broadcast to a gathering of their supporters on their birthday in January this year.
The call was made from inside a high-security prison in Durham.
 They are heard saying that “this revolution is their life”, they advise their people not to betray the party: “Go back to base and everything will be fine.”
Rodney Sieh, editor of Front Page Africa – the Liberian paper that published the call – said they were sure that Taylor knew that “he was speaking to an audience”.
Taylor wanted their people to know that they were still relevant, according to Mr Sieh.
“He still wants their voice heard” in the Liberian political scene, they said.
‘I'll be back'
Mrs Howard Taylor has made their allegiance to their ex-husband clear.
In an interview with local journalists outside a campaign rally, they said that the country needed to get back to the “agenda” outlined by Taylor when they were president.
But they denied that they were influencing the 2017 elections.
Speaking to the BBC after a friendly football game just outside the capital, Mr Weah admitted to taking a call from prison.
But they rejected the idea that strings were being pulled.
“Charles Taylor is not running the campaign for us,” they said.
Defending their choice of running mate they said simply: “People love her, they were the mother of this nation.
“If Charles Taylor was campaigning for me, I think the world would be aware.”
But the world is aware of the alleged interference and it is concerned.
Since news broke of the phone call, the US Congress passed a resolution that condemned any “external interference” in the poll and specifically any attempt by the convicted war criminal “to influence the elections from prison”.
The EU mission in Liberia has also made it clear that “Charles Taylor is serving a 50 year jail sentence and they are not coming back to Liberia”.
But if Taylor themselves was to be believed when they left Liberia to be exiled in Nigeria on 11 August 2003, their intentions were clear.
“God willing, I will be back,” they said at a resignation ceremony in the capital.
‘Sleepy Joe'
Observers are concerned about meddling that could go beyond election day itself.
Mr Sieh told the BBC that Mr Weah now has some of Taylor's closest aides around him.
“He may not be here physically but they could influence a lot of things if one of these people are elected,” the editor said.
Mr Weah and Mrs Howard Taylor's main opponent is considered to be Vice-President Joseph Boakai – or “Sleepy Joe” as they are commonly known – because they are often caught napping at public events.
The 73-year-old has served as vice-president under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female president, for the past 12 years. But rumours of a rift between the two are rife.
“A lot more needs to be achieved,” they told us when we caught up with them on the campaign trail.
“The Liberian people want to see development and someone who can unify them.”
Asked about their nickname they smiled and said they are “a dreamer”, but whether they have the charisma and dynamism to captivate Liberia's youthful population, only the vote on 10 October will prove.
They have 20 candidates to choose from.
‘Tired of war'
Although many commentators predict a second round between Mr Weah and Mr Boakai, former Coca-Cola executive Alexander Cummings, who came on to the scene 18 months ago, is fast becoming a serious contender.
A candidate needs more than 50% of the vote for a first-round victory.
According to Mr Sieh, with their door-to-door strategy, Mr Cummings has changed the way campaigns are carried out in Liberia and they might just make it to a run-off.
But for most Liberians, the most important thing is peace.
Hundreds of women across the country are fasting and praying for a peaceful election.
Just opposite President Sirleaf's private residence, 44-year-old Bernice Freeman is one of more than 100 women gathered under a tent providing shade from the hot sun.
“Every woman here has a very bitter past,” they said with a determined look in their eye.
“Some of us were raped several times, we are tired.”
The power of these women cannot be underestimated – this same group is credited with bringing an end to the conflict by forcing the warlords to engage in peace talks.
Nobody here wants a return to those days.

If latest speculations and media reports are to be believed, Brahmastra co-stars Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are having a secret affair. The news of the two dating has taken the internet by storm as Ranbir and Alia have been spending a lot of quality time with each other these days.
Bollywood heartthrob Ranbir Kapoor and diva Alia Bhatt, who will be seen together in Ayan Mukerji's Brahmastra, are said to be in a secret relationship, according to the latest media reports. The two have been allegedly spending a lot of quality time together even after the shooting is over. While Ranbir was rumoured to be dating Pakistani beauty Mahira Khan, it was known to all that Alia Bhatt was dating their Student of The Year co-star Sidharth Malhotra. However, if we go by the speculations, Ranbir and Alia have found love in each other.
Earlier this year Ranbir and Alia were spotted chilling together. Their pictures from their outing made its way on social media thanks to their fan pages. The duo also attended the Padmaavat screening together last week. Not to forget Alia and Ranbir have been spotted together on numerous occasions in recent times. In fact, now latest reports are that that Alia and Ranbir have started meeting secretly at each other places. For the unknown, Ranbir dropped by Alia's house on Wednesday night at around 11 pm and left only next morning at around 7 am.
It will be for the first time that Ranbir and Alia would be seen sharing the screen space on the silver screen. The Dharma Productions' film is Ayan's third project, which comes four years after their successful romantic-comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani. The young filmmaker said they have all their hopes pinned on Brahmastra, which was announced in 2016. Besides Ranbir and Alia, megastar Amitabh Bachchan will also feature in the film and Ayan admitted that the veteran was in their mind since they conceptualised the project years ago.

LUCKNOW, India (AP) — A senior cleric at an influential Islamic seminary in northern India has issued a religious decree saying that Muslim women should not watch men playing soccer.
Mufti Athar Kasmi said that watching men "playing with bare knees" violated the tenets of Islam and was forbidden for women. Kasmi is cleric at Darul Uloom, Asia's largest Sunni Muslim seminary in the northern town of Deoband.
The cleric also lashed out at the men who allow their wives to watch football even on television.
"Do you have no shame? Do you not fear God? You let them watch these kinds of things," they said in their sermon Friday.
Kasmi's decree comes even as the Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia allowed women in to watch matches in soccer stadiums earlier this month.
"Why do women need to watch these football matches? What they will gain by looking at footballer's thighs. Their attention will be on that only and they will even miss the scores," Kasmi said.
Darul Uloom, located in Uttar Pradesh state, is a more than 150-year-old seminary that teaches Sunni Hanafi jurisprudence. The Islamic seminary's rigid interpretation of Islam is the ideological foundation for many hard-line religious groups including the Taliban movement in Afghanistan.
About 13 percent of India's 1.3 billion people are Muslim and the majority of them are Sunni but the country's secular constitution ensures that decrees such as Kasmi's have no legal force.
On Tuesday a Muslim women's rights activist in the northern city of Lucknow decried the decree.
"It implies that Muslim women should not watch any athletic event, tennis matches or swimming championships. How it can be immoral for a woman to watch men playing sport?" Sahira Nasih said.
Recently the seminary issued a fatwa asking Muslim women not to visit beauty salons or wear tight clothing.
Mexico City (AFP) - A photojournalist who had received threats over their work in the northern Mexican state of San Luis Potosi has been found dead, the government said Friday, a day after they were kidnapped.
The federal Mechanism to Protect Journalists and Rights Activists called for an "immediate and effective investigation" into the killing of Edgar Daniel Esqueda, who was reportedly kidnapped Thursday by gunmen disguised as police officers.
 They are at least the 11th journalist killed so far this year in Mexico, which rights group say drug wars and corruption have made one of the most dangerous countries in the world for the press.
Local media reported that Esqueda's body was found dumped by the San Luis Potosi airport, bound and bearing signs of torture.
The federal protection program said Esqueda, who worked for several local news websites, had recently reported that state police had threatened and harassed them while they were working.
They told authorities that five police officers threatened to beat them up and take their camera while they photographed the scene of a shootout on July 4, forcing them to delete their photos.
Nine days later, police reportedly harassed them again while they were working, saying they "would be watching him" because they suspected they were "passing information to the bad guys," the federal program said in a statement.
The federal protection program had asked local authorities to grant Esqueda protective measures, but it is unclear whether they were ever given any of the measures offered by the program, such as security cameras, panic buttons and bodyguards.
Investigators have denied that Esqueda was kidnapped by police, saying the gunmen who hauled them from their home on Thursday morning were criminals disguised as police officers.
Colleagues of the slain photojournalist protested in San Luis Potosi, the state capital, after their body was found, placing their cameras on the ground atop handwritten signs reading "Enough already" and "Justice."
Right groups say at least 11 journalists have been killed in Mexico so far this year, though it is unclear whether they were all targeted because of their work.
Since 2000, more than 100 journalists have been murdered in Mexico. More than 90 percent of the crimes remain unpunished.

A Derbyshire woman has been fined almost £1,000 for driving 6mph over the speed limit.
Hasnija Osmanagic was driving their black BMW at 36mph, along a 30mph stretch of the A5111 Raynesway where it branches off from Shardlow Road in Alvaston.
The 31-year-old was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution for the speeding offence, which happened in April last year.
As part of the process, they were asked to identify the driver at the time of the safety camera activation, despite a number of letters, they did not respond.
They were then contacted by phone and asked to have the Notice of Intended Prosecution sent by email but didn't respond to that either.
As a result, Osmanagic, of Cowslip Meadow, Draycott, was charged with failing to give information when required relating to the identity of a driver.
They appeared at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court last week and was fined £830, with court costs pushing the total to £998. Them licence was also endorsed with six points.
Sergeant Scott Jeffreys, from our Casualty Reduction Enforcement Support Team, said: “We carry out these checks on roads across Derbyshire to make sure drivers are sticking to the speed limits.
“There is no excuse for breaking them and anyone caught doing so may face a fine, points on their licence and in some cases, a ban.
“If you ignore all of the correspondence following a safety camera activation, even if you were not the driver, you will be committing another offence entirely.
“Hopefully this sends a clear message that, if you ignore a Notice of Intended Prosecution, you could face a costly experience in court.”
Will Ride-Hailing Apps Cure Medical Transportation Woes?
Lyft and Uber are attempting to cure a major medical problem for poor people and the elderly: Getting a ride to the doctor.
The ride-hailing services are expanding their offer to take patients around the country to and from non-emergency health care appointments, and they have a huge market to target.
More than 7 million Americans miss medical care every year due to a lack of transportation, according to health economist Paul Hughes-Cromwick.
Health insurers and care providers have been trying to solve this problem for years. Those who have studied it say Lyft and Uber will help, but improving access to health care involves more than just lining up a ride.
A Closer Look
Q: What are these companies offering?
A: Lyft said Monday it is partnering with the information technology company Allscripts to expand the number of rides it offers through doctor's offices and other health care providers. The company already provides transportation to millions of patients each year through partnerships with insurers, large health care systems and others.
Uber announced last week that it will offer health care transportation in every U.S. market where it operates, the continuation of a venture it has been testing since last summer.
Both companies say they will operate in cities and less-populated rural areas, and they will bill the care provider or an insurer -- not the patient -- for the rides. Patients don't need a smartphone or an application to use their services.
They're digging into an issue that has long been a concern for insurers and health care providers. The state- and federally funded Medicaid program for poor people and the disabled covers transportation costs.
The insurer Molina Healthcare, which specializes in Medicaid, has offered a transportation benefit for around 25 years. Molina provides bus passes and works with transportation brokers to arrange rides.
Q: What are the benefits?
A: Health care providers say rides with Uber or Lyft can be easier to schedule and cheaper than other alternatives like taxis. Uber, for instance, says it can schedule rides within a few hours or up to 30 days in advance.
These companies help people who might otherwise have to wait around for a friend or family member to pick them up, said Carlos Ospina, chief clinical officer of New Jersey-based Pro Staff Physical Therapy.
"It gives the patient more independence or power to get to and from visits," they said.
The company has had a "significantly lower" number of cancellations due to transportation problems since it started using Uber last fall, Ospina said.
Q: Can they erase the problem?
A: Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania offered Lyft to help around 300 Medicaid patients make primary care appointments at two practices in Philadelphia. They were surprised to find that relatively few people accepted the offer in their study, and it did not lead to a drop in missed appointments.
Lead author Dr. Krisda Chaiyachati said there were several possible reasons for the low interest. The offer was made over the phone, and patients might have been more receptive if it was done in person, like at a doctor's office.
They also noted that many of the patients were familiar with Lyft but hadn't used it. They may have been reluctant to switch from rides they were used to liking public transportation.
Chaiyachati said he's optimistic that ride-hailing services will ease transportation problems for some, but other options like home visits or telemedicine may also be needed.
"It's just not that easy or that straightforward," they said.

Salary arrears: Teachers give 19 states 30-day ultimatum
By Ola Ajayi
Ibadan—THE Nigeria Union of Teachers, NUT, has given a 30-day ultimatum to 19 states owing its members several months of salary to either settle the backlog of salary arrears or face an indefinite strike.
The ultimatum was given yesterday, by the National President of the union, Mr Michael Alogba Olukoya, during a National Executive Council, NEC, meeting held at the Teachers House, Oluyole, Ibadan.
The NUT leader named the states and what they owe as salaries. According to him, Benue owes 10 months, Ekiti and Cross River owe six months each, Kogi which has been paying half salaries since 2013 owes15 months while Ondo owes five months.
Others include Taraba which owes four months. Niger, Delta and Oyo owe three months each.
Also Abia owes five months, Osun has been paying its teachers half salary for 23 months, Nasarawa has paid half salary for 18 months, Plateau, half salary since 2010, Adamawa, four months, Bayelsa eight and a half months, Imo (paying 70% monthly salary, Kwara owes four months), Borno, yet to pay minimum wage, and Zamfara (yet to implement national minimum wage).
They said: “We hereby give a 30-day ultimatum to all the above-mentioned states to pay all outstanding salaries being owed teachers. They will soon collect another Paris Club money and we hope they will pay all the backlog of salary arrears.”
” If any State fails to pay up within this stipulated time, we shall converge again and give a notice of action. There is going to be total disconnect between us and such governments”, Olukoya threatened on behalf of their members, nationwide.
They said; “Local government councils only have the role of participation. It is therefore important to e

Grammys broaden album award to boost classical, jazz
The Grammy for Album of the Year, one of the most prestigious prizes in music, will have looser requirements this year to allow more classical and jazz works to compete.
The Recording Academy, the group of music professionals who vote on the awards, announced the change Wednesday before the nominating process starts for the 60th Grammys, which will take place on January 28.
Under previous rules, the academy considered for Album of the Year any work released in the qualifying year that ran at least 15 minutes with five or more distinct tracks.
In the revision, the Recording Academy dropped the requirement of five tracks if the album runs 30 minutes or more.
“The definition expansion allows for greater inclusion of music creators who produce longer pieces, particularly in the classical, dance and jazz fields,” it said in a statement.
In practice, pop and rock artists have dominated the category since the 1960s. The last two winners of Album of the Year were both major commercial successes — Adele's “25” this year and Taylor Swift's “1989” in 2016.
Jazz legend Herbie Hancock won in 2008, but for an album that covered songs by folk pop pioneer Joni Mitchell.
The Recording Academy also announced that its 13,000 voters will for the first time vote online this year, rather than mail-in ballots.
The Grammys will mark its 60th edition by bringing the gala to New York after more than a decade in Los Angeles.

Jean Renoir did not always treasure their father's paintings; early on, they may have principally appreciated them for the money they made selling them to fund their films. Yet, eventually, after moving to Los Angeles, they spoke of Pierre-Auguste Renoir as the central influence of their life, which they elaborated on in the genial memoir “Renoir, My Father.”
The place of one Renoir in the career of the other is the subject of “Renoir: Father and Son/Painting and Cinema,” a terrific, heartfelt exhibition now on view here at the Barnes Foundation. Though the show seriously considers the interplay of media, this is largely an exhibition about Jean Renoir, and about cinema. There are just 16 works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir; the museum's own 181 Renoir paintings remain on their traditional yellow walls, according to the terms of the will of Albert C. Barnes, the foundation's founder. The galleries are filled instead with projected clips from “A Day in the Country,” “The Diary of a Chambermaid” and more than a dozen other films by the younger Renoir, as well as stills, posters, correspondence and costumes. (The show was curated by Sylvie Patry, a deputy director at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and a veteran of the Barnes. It travels to the Orsay in November.)
As a boy, Jean Renoir did not have a close relationship with their father. As in many bourgeois households in fin-de-siècle France, Jean's mother and the domestic staff looked after them and their two siblings, while their father was largely out of sight. Pierre-Auguste Renoir was known not as “Papa” but as “Patron,” or “the boss” — the same nickname Rivette and other New Wave directors would later apply to their son.
The boy's most consistent contact with their father would have occurred while they were posing for him, and there are half a dozen paintings of young Jean in this exhibition. In a portrait from 1903, the 9-year-old son appears with a jaunty red foulard tied about their neck; as is so often true of Renoirs, the oil paint looks like pastel, and Jean's hair has the delicacy of spun silk. (In the same gallery, we see the 60-something Jean Renoir posing with that childhood portrait for a feature in the magazine Paris Match.)
SAN DIEGO (KGTV) - The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has a public warning about a blackmail scam involving the digital currency Bitcoin.
Investigators say potential victims have received a letter in the mail in which the scammer threatens to release embarrassing information unless the victim pays with Bitcoin.
The blackmailer also includes instructions on how to buy Bitcoin and a Bitcoin wallet where the money should be sent, according to deputies.
The Sheriff's Department says anyone who receives this letter should be advised this is a scam.
Crimes involving mail are handled by the U.S. Postal Service. If you receive a blackmail letter, you can contact the Postal Inspection Service at 877-876-2455.

Once filming wrapped on the sixth season of their hit Bravo show, "Don't Be Tardy," star Kim Zolciak-Biermann had a difficult decision to make.
Back in April, their 4-year-old son, Kash, suffered "very traumatic injuries" after being bitten by one of their family's five dogs. The incident made numerous headlines throughout the spring and into the summer, and Zolciak-Biermann "100%" considered not letting the moment air on the upcoming season, they told AOL Entertainment over the phone this week.

"With this situation, I obviously had the option to show it or not, and I have to be honest with you: I was leaning toward not showing it at all," they explained. "The only reason why we opted to share the situation is because we do have such a large following and are able to show that it could happen to anybody."
The moment is heavily teased in the trailer for season 6 of "Don't Be Tardy" and was clearly an emotional and scary moment for everyone in their family, but Zolciak-Biermann was intent on reminding people that dogs "are still animals at the end of the day."
See photos of Kim Zolciak-Biermann:
"You forget that," they said. "Dogs can't tell you to turn the music down or that they're tired and not to talk to them. My goal with this whole situation is to prevent this from happening ever again."
Though the 39-year-old told us that they don't plan on watching the episode, they are looking forward to "reliving" their vow renewal with Kroy, which took place earlier this year seven years -- to the day -- after they first met. Their six shared children attended the ceremony in Turks & Caicos, which happened just 10 days after Kash's bite.
"It definitely had a lot more meaning than you could even imagine," Zolciak-Biermann remembered of the intimate moment. "We definitely weren't prepared with everything going on, but it was pretty special after all we had been through."

The Bravo star explained that their "marriage takes priority above all else -- even before the kids" in their life, which spoke to the importance of their vow renewal.
That being said, though, the mother-of-six shares an incredibly tight bond with their children, especially their 20-year-old daughter, Brielle. The mother-daughter pair has made headlines in recent years for their social media presence and similar looks, which have prompted speculation about plastic surgery. Zolciak-Biermann laughs off those accusations.
"People kill me when they're like, 'Oh, my God! They're having plastic surgery to look like each other!'" they told us. "It's like, 'Um, she's my daughter. Of course they look like me.'"
See photos of Brielle Biermann:
And as Brielle continues to navigate the spotlight, their mother has been nothing but proud of their daughter.
"She's incredible. Not just because she's my daughter, but because she's such a good girl," they gushed. "She's almost boring. I've never smoked weed or done a drug in my life. I like good food and good wine, and Brielle is kind of the same. They love being in a relationship with [boyfriend] Michael, and she's super involved with their little brothers and sisters. She's a well-balanced girl who thankfully hasn't gone down the wrong path. I'm very proud of who they are."
As for their upcoming return to "Real Housewives of Atlanta," which will make them one of the only Real Housewives in history with two concurrent shows on Bravo, Zolciak-Biermann says that, even though they never could've envisioned having two shows at once, she'll still be reaching for the stars.
"It's still not enough for me," they said with a laugh. "It's like, 'Holy sh-t, I have two shows!' It's pretty incredible, and I have an attitude for gratitude, which is why I think I'm at where I'm at. I never take it for granted. 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' is still the No. 1 show on Bravo. They've been so great to me and my family."
"Don't Be Tardy" premieres on Bravo on Friday, Oct. 6, at 8 p.m. EST.

It's the end of an era – LoveFilm is closing.
The LoveFilm DVD rental service, which sends customers DVD rentals by post, will be closing later this year – on 31 October 2017.
Amazon, who currently owns the service, explained that the shift towards online streaming was an obvious factor in deciding to cease the DVD rental service.
“We have very much enjoyed delivering the LoveFilm By Post service to our customers,” said an Amazon spokesperson. “However, over the last few years we've seen a decreasing demand for DVD and Blu-ray rental as customers increasingly move to streaming.”

“Due to this, we will be closing the LoveFilm By Post business on October 31, 2017,” they added. “We are committed to finding alternative roles for all LoveFilm employees within Amazon.”
Obviously, the DVD rental service just can't compete with the on-demand nature of online streaming, and that's where the service falls down. But it looks as though not everyone is a fan of Amazon Prime or Netflix…
And the move has already irritated some customers.
“It's not great, to be honest,” customer Michael Harrison told the BBC.
They argued that there's simply a much wider selection available to rent on DVD and Blu-ray when compared to streaming services… and there are obvious technological benefits, too.
“You don't have to buffer it, or worry about pixelation,” they added. “I live in a small town and we don't have many shops around – it was great for me to get films posted to me.”
Amazon has created a LoveFilm Help Page to notify customers of the closure.
But for now, it looks as though DVD rental is dead…

More Woes for Uber: Exec Resigns, Investor Sues Ousted CEO
Uber Technologies Inc. faced a fresh round of turmoil Thursday, with its global operations chief resigning and a major investor suing the ride-hailing company's former CEO.
Ryan Graves told Uber staff in an email Thursday that they will transition out of their role as senior vice president of global operations in mid-September. Graves will remain on Uber's board.
That board -- and its support for former CEO Travis Kalanick [pictured above] -- was the subject of a lawsuit filed Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court by Benchmark Capital Partners.
Benchmark is a major investor with 13 percent of Uber's stock. It claims Kalanick is trying to pack Uber's board with their allies and eventually return to their post as CEO. The venture capital firm says that would harm Uber's shareholders, employees, drivers and customers.
A spokesperson for Kalanick said the lawsuit is "completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations."
In the lawsuit, Benchmark claims Kalanick concealed material information from investors when they created three new board seats in 2016 and gave themselves the right to appoint people to those seats. Among other things, Benchmark said, Kalanick knew Uber might be accused of stealing trade secrets from Waymo, Google's self-driving unit. Waymo sued Uber earlier this year.
The lawsuit also says Kalanick didn't discuss their failure to curb Uber's pervasive culture of discrimination and sexual harassment.
Kalanick resigned under pressure in June after a monthslong investigation into harassment and other behavior problems at the San Francisco-based company. But they quickly appointed themselves to one of the three board seats. The other two remain vacant.
Benchmark says Kalanick has acquired "a disproportionate level of influence over the board, ensuring that they would continue to have an outsized role in Uber's strategic direction even if forced to resign as CEO." The firm says Kalanick has already interfered in the board's attempts to hire a new CEO.
Benchmark wants to remove the three additional seats and return the board to eight members. It's also asking the court to prevent Kalanick from participating in board meetings.
Uber said it had no comment on the lawsuit. But in a statement, Kalanick's spokesperson said the lawsuit is an attempt to deprive Kalanick of their rights as an Uber founder and shareholder.
"Travis will continue to act in the interests of Uber and all of its stakeholders and is confident that these entirely baseless claims will be rejected," the statement said.

It's a safe place, so you can do whatever you like in the locker room. We will have it out in there, because we don't always agree, and that's good because diversity makes us stronger. But when we leave the locker room, we leave as a team. A lot of that came from how my dad dealt with problems.
It's about making yourself accessible by getting out there and having very natural conversations with all sorts of people. I'll walk into one of our offices and chat for 10 minutes with the person at the front desk. I tend to learn more from them than I do from stuff that's filtered through six layers of management by the time it gets to me.
What kinds of things were you involved in as a kid outside class?
I got into swimming at an early age. I was not a natural swimmer, but I worked really hard. I was always first in the pool and last out of the pool.
I swam probably more than I slept. It requires a certain discipline to swim at a state and national level. It gave me a sense of purpose, and it released a lot of energy.
And what about during your college years?
I was determined not to be a poor student, so I started a business. I figured that lawyers seem to have money and I wanted some of it, so I started selling word-processing systems to lawyers. I ran that business all through university. I did well. I was not a poor student.
Early leadership lessons?
I learned from my managers about what to do and what not to do. You see things that you think are ludicrous and you try not to do them yourself, and there are things that you see others do very successfully.

I will say that open communication — being very fair but deliberate, honest and genuine — is appreciated by people. If you try to perfume the pig or dress it up, or dance around an issue, you're unlikely to have a very effective result.

People value honesty most of all. If you have to deliver a very candid message to someone, it's best to approach the conversation as coaching them on how they can think about potentially doing it better.
But a lot of people go out of their way to avoid having difficult conversations.
People generally don't like confrontation. I don't view it as confrontation. I view feedback as a gift, and let's have a conversation about other ways you can approach things.

View all New York Times newsletters.
Don't tell them what's really going wrong. Talk about other alternatives for dealing with the problem and try to tackle it that way. Then it's not as confrontational.
What about recent leadership lessons?
I think a lot about my job as “seam stitching.” In a large corporation, people in each division tend to focus on what they've got to get done. But the real value inside a company is when we stitch the seams between each of those divisions and develop a strategy that everyone can get behind so we're pointing in the same direction.
I also use a framework called the “three waves of innovation.” It's a surfing analogy. Wave one is the wave you're on at the moment, the current core business. Wave two is about looking at all the waves that are coming in and deciding which one to choose. That's about growth.
And the third wave is what all great surfers do, which is to go home and pull the weather reports and figure out when the next big one is coming. In business, that's pure invention and category creation.
How do you hire?
I look for raw intelligence. I don't need a high I.Q., but I do need people to be street smart. And I look for fire in the belly. If you're missing either of those two things, or if you don't have them in abundance, things won't work out well. Then I look for the ability to lead.
Often, I'll learn about you in a conversation structured around your career. So I'll get up and scribble on a whiteboard, and ask about all things you've done and learned. What's been the biggest curveball you didn't expect? How did you deal with it?
Then I'll ask about what retirement looks like for them. Because I'm trying to understand what drives people. When you're bouncing your grandkids on your knee, what do you want to tell them you did?
What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?
I will tell them to manage their own careers. The biggest mistake most people make is that they think career management is the job of your manager. It's not. It's your job, and you should spend as much time on that as you do about any other planning activity in your life.

And push yourself out of your comfort zone, because most people won't do that.
The United States has the largest incarcerated population in the world, climbing from 600,000 to over 2 million in just a few decades. We also have the highest percentage of our population behind bars of any country. The people most likely to languish behind bars are Black, Latino, Native American, and poor. It's a legacy rooted in Jim Crow-era policies that continues in the thinly veiled racism of the war on drugs, as lawyer Michelle Alexander points out in their book The New Jim Crow.
But there's another number that dwarfs the prison population: Nearly 5 million people are under some sort of parole or probation supervision in the United States. That's a fourfold increase since 1980, according to a new report released this week by the Columbia University's Justice Lab. During that time, the requirements for people under judicial supervision have become more stringent. The number of conditions people must adhere to have increased, for example, as has the length of supervision required. As a result, many people wind up in jail—not for committing another crime, but for a technical violation of probation or parole conditions.
In fact, from 1990 to 2004, the rate of people on probation who were sent back to jail for non-compliance grew by 50 percent, from 220,000 to 330,000, according to the report.
This suggests a way to vastly reduce the rate of imprisonment in the United States, just by reducing the number of people who wind up in jail because of these technical violations.
In some cases, the infractions that send someone back to jail are as simple as coming late to a meeting with a parole officer or failing to make payments on a fine. Being a person of color increases the odds of winding up in prison for a parole violation, according to a study by the Urban Institute.
One of the most chilling reasons for being sent back to prison is failure to pay a fine or court or supervision fees, payments that can be out of reach for the low-income people most likely to be caught up in the criminal justice system.
In some jurisdictions, about 20 percent of those serving time were incarcerated because they didn't pay their criminal justice debts, according to a Council of Economic Advisors issue paper.
Consider the impossible situation faced by newly released inmates. Many are poor when they enter the system; along with their conviction comes fines and fees. As one example, in Washington state, these average $1,300 for a felony conviction, according to research by University of Washington sociology professor Alexes Harris.
Interest is charged on the original debt, and by the time an inmate is released, their debt may have grown quite large. Finding a job that pays enough to make payments on these debts is difficult after incarceration, especially since public housing and other services are denied to those convicted felons. This challenge is even greater for released inmates who are mentally ill, physically disabled, have a history of substance abuse, or have few social support systems.
“High fines and fee payments may force … difficult trade-offs between paying court debt and other necessary purchases,” says the Council issue paper. “Unsustainable debt coupled with the threat of incarceration may even encourage some formerly incarcerated individuals to return to criminal activity to pay off their debts.”
These fines and fees result in what is tantamount to debtors' prisons. They are expensive and counter-productive.
Which suggests a way out. The Justice Lab report proposes policies that would increase the chances that someone who has served their time will successfully transition to life after prison.
These policies include reducing the number of years of supervision on probation or after release. This could reduce the chances that a routine infraction would result in additional fines and jail time, and also reduce caseloads of overworked parole officers, who could then focus on providing support to parolees who are at risk of reoffending. Or we could shorten time on probation or parole based on “good behavior,” so people can work their way out of the system. And we could reduce fines and fees, so there is less financial pressure on people just as they are trying to regain their footing.
Van Jones, host of CNN's new segment The Van Jones Show and founder of #cut50, a national effort to cut in half the people behind bars, put it this way, according to a news release for the Justice Lab report: Now is the time to “reimagine how probation and parole can truly help people reintegrate back into society—rather than simply being a trap that leads to needless reincarceration.”
The Justice Lab report shows that jurisdictions that have taken this route have seen reductions in crime, reductions in spending, and fewer people locked up. A win-win-win, except for those who profit from the prison-industrial complex.
Confederation Cup: It's not yet Uhuru for Rivers Utd — Amiesimaka
Nigerian football legend, Adokiye Amiesimaka has warned Rivers United to be prepared for a stiff challenge when they face Rwandan club, Rayon Sports in the second leg of the CAF Confederation Cup tie.
The Nigerian club eased to a 2-0 win in the first leg at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Port Harcourt on Sunday to put themselves in the box seat for qualification for the group stage of the competition. “A 2-0 (result) is as good a scoreline as any.
“Only 1-0 may turn out to be safe, just as 4-0 may not be safe. In this game, any margin is as safe or precarious as you make it. It is possible to lose at home, but win away. It is possible to win at home and also win away.“It is possible to win at home, but lose away.
“It is possible to lose, home and away. Each instance has happened before. Any result is possible. To win is simply to make sure you score more goals than you concede,” they said.

By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp said on Monday it had agreed to settle a U.S. labor board case on whether the company is accountable for its franchisees' alleged labor law violations, according to a source involved in the case.
The settlement, which must be approved by a National Labor Relations Board judge, would allow McDonald's to avoid a ruling that it is a "joint employer" of workers at McDonald's franchises and can be held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law.
The terms of the proposed settlement were not immediately available.
McDonald's could not immediately be reached for comment. The company has maintained it is not a joint employer of franchise workers.
Business groups have said that a ruling against McDonald's could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers.
Illinois-based McDonald's and the office of NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb presented the settlement to an administrative judge at a hearing in New York, according to the source, who was briefed on the hearing and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Union-backed worker advocacy group Fight for $15 filed dozens of legal claims on behalf of McDonald's workers beginning in 2012. The group said workers across the United States were fired for taking part in protests calling for higher wages.
The judge had agreed in January to pause the trial against McDonald's that began in 2015 so that Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company.
Fight for $15 lawyer Micah Wissinger said the group would object to the proposed settlement.
"In a real settlement, McDonald's would take responsibility for illegally firing and harassing workers fighting to get off food stamps and out of poverty," they said.
The case was seen as an important test of how a 2015 NLRB decision that had rankled business groups by making it easier to prove that a company is a joint employer would apply to franchisees.
In December, a new Republican majority on the board overturned the 2015 decision and said only companies with direct control over workers may be considered joint employers.
Last month, the board said its December ruling was invalid because NLRB member William Emanuel, a Trump appointee, had a conflict of interest. Emanuel's former law firm represented a staffing agency involved in the 2015 NLRB case.

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Donald Trump's pick to lead the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command.
On a voice vote, the Senate approved Paul Nakasone for one of the nation's top intelligence posts. They also approved their military promotion to general.
Nakasone, a longtime member of the cryptologic community, has a strong background in cyber issues.  They are replacing the current director, Mike Rogers, who is retiring.
During their confirmation hearing, Nakasone said China, Russia and other nations that launch cyberattacks against the United States aren't worried about retribution and see no reason to change their behavior.
"They don't fear us," they said at the hearing, adding that the U.S. must impose costs on those adversaries to make them stop.
Nakasone previously commanded the U.S. Army Cyber Command and held military intelligence positions in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Republic of Korea.

In a chat with Sports Vanguard yesterday, Laloko said, “Edwin helped position the Pepsi Football Academy in Enugu. They were very diligent, very dutiful and they did their job very well.
“We cannot easily find a replacement for Edwin because we may never find anybody like them again.”
Laloko said the Pepsi Academy will be sending a delegation to Enugu for their burial. “We will be fully represented at the burial. Already, we have sent some money to the widow. We will be there with our banners and all.”
On their part, Emma Okocha, a veteran journalist who co-authored a book on Rangers with the late Edwin Eze said the death of the former Rangers International' secretary was a big blow to the Nigerian sports family.
Okocha who was at Vanguard premises yesterday, said, “I have come to mourn with the Nigerian sporting family, including the sports writers on the death of this great man.
“As I am speaking with you now, we have had a meeting with the management of Rangers and have agreed to participate fully in the burial of the last secretary of Rangers.
“Eze did so much for most of those that played for Rangers. They facilitated the rise to stardom of stars like Jay Jay Okocha, Davidson Owumi, Ikechukwu Ofoje among others. They were a great man.”
Tennis buff, Chief Ben Ezeibe also paid glowing tribute to the former Rangers scribe saying, “when I was chairperson of the Tennis Association in Anambra State, Edwin did a lot, covering tennis and helped us build the sport. Their death is a big blow to us all.”

NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – A suspect carrying a crudely-assembled improvised bomb is in custody following a blast in the underground walkway between Times Square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal Monday morning.
The blast happened at around 7:20 a.m. during Monday morning rush hour.
EXTRA: Video Captures Moment Of Blast
Three other people suffered minor injuries that are not considered life-threatening. The other three transported themselves to area hospitals with symptoms like ringing in the ears, officials said.
The suspect has been identified as Akayed Ullah, 27, who was wearing an improvised explosive device, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said.
Ullah intentionally detonated the device, O'Neill said.
Ullah is from Bangladesh and had been living in Brooklyn. They arrived in the United States in February of 2011 and had a visa. They came in with their parents and 3-4 siblings and subsequently obtained a Green Card and became a permanent U.S. resident.
Ullah has two addresses associated with them in Brooklyn.
They were rushed to Bellevue Hospital with non life-threatening injuries. They suffered burns to their hands and abdomen.
Ullah made statements to investigators to the effect that they were inspired by ISIS.
Anyone with any information about Ullah is asked to call authorities at 1-888-NYC-SAFE.
Authorities are investigating addresses and workplaces associated with the suspect. Ullah had a NYC Taxi & Limousine license, which had lapsed.
The device was affixed to their body with velcro and zipties, according to O'Neill.

A second device was found on the suspect, police said.
“He may have been inspired by ISIS. They could've been inspired by Al Qaeda. That they were at the very least inspired by Islamist terrorism,” said Rep. Peter King. “It could turn out that this is part of a larger plot. It could be that they have been meeting with other people in Brooklyn or in New York or in the New York metropolitan area and that they could be planning on carrying out attacks. So you can't rule anything out at this stage. You have to assume the worst and work your way back.”
Port Authority Police Officer Jack Collins held the suspect at gunpoint assisted by officers Sean Gallagher, Drew Preston and Anthony Manfredini.

The crudely-made device had wires protruding from it.
A federal law enforcement official says the device malfunctioned — it did not fully detonate, according to the official.
Authorities are investigating the attack as a possible “lone wolf” based on the rudimentary construction of the device.
The NYPD is beefing up security around town, officials said.
“NYPD will adjust and adapting the way they always do. Right now, they don't believe there's any follow-up attack immediately planned, but there are still several weeks to go before Christmas, two weeks from today,” King said.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A Florida college professor fired after publicly saying the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut was a hoax has lost a lawsuit claiming they were wrongfully terminated.
Local news outlets report that a federal jury on Monday sided with Florida Atlantic University. The school contended communications professor James Tracy was fired last year not because of their blog posts about the Sandy Hook school shooting but because they violated rules regarding reporting of outside work.
Tracy claimed their firing violated their free speech rights. They wrote on their blog that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax by the government to impose tougher gun control. Tracy sought reinstatement to their position, back pay and damages.
Twenty children and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook in 2012.
The West Feliciana Parish Sheriff's Office is warning residents of a phone scam that has impacted multiple people in the parish already.
Officials say virtual kidnapping is a phone scam where the caller tries to convince the victim that a loved one has been kidnapped and will be harmed unless a ransom is paid. The scammer calls from an unfamiliar number and typically claims to have the victim's child or grandchild. Some victims have even reported being able to hear a child screaming in the background.
"I received a call from a number in Mexico and during the call, there was a child crying and saying, 'Help me! Mom! Mom! Help me,'" said one victim of the scam.
Officials with the FBI say scammers have been trying variations of this phone scam for years. In one case in Leesburg, Virginia, a mother, who believed their daughter was being held by deadly kidnappers, wired the scammer nearly $10,000. The mother realized the call was a scam when their daughter then texted them during the phone call.
West Feliciana officials say numbers in St. Francisville are being called as well. Anyone contacted by one of these scammers should not provide them with any money and should instead hang up and report the scammer to the West Feliciana Parish Sheriff's Office at 225-784-3136.

To start, there just isn't much need for the eagles -- they were support to thwart terrorists and potential accidents, but there thankfully hasn't been much of a problem. And, like you might guess, even birds trained from youth to intercept drones won't always do what they're told. There was a concern that their performance problems in tests might be magnified in the chaos of real-world conditions. Raising and training these predators wasn't cheap, either.
Dutch police are also ending an experiment that had rats sniffing out fake cigarettes, human remains and illegal fireworks. The rodents couldn't be made "operational," police said.
It wasn't hard to predict that the eagle program would shut down. Even if you discount the utility of the birds, anti-drone technology is advancing quickly enough that technology can likely do the job as well or better. If you can disable drones at will with a portable gun, why spend years grooming eagles that aren't even guaranteed to do what you want? As it stands, we're sure the eagles would rather catch the sort of prey they can eat.
University of Benin Teaching Hospital: We lost 5 months to strike in 2016, says CMD
They said industrial actions embarked upon by the various unions in the hospital were hinged on staff welfare.
The Chief Medical Director (CMD), University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Prof. Michael Ibadin, on Monday said industrial actions disrupted medical activities in the hospital for a cumulative period of five months in 2016.
Ibadin disclosed this during interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Benin.
They said industrial actions embarked upon by the various unions in the hospital were hinged on staff welfare.
They said that some of the issues had been resolved while others were yet to be resolved as they were not captured in the 2016 budget for the hospital.
“The resident doctors in the hospital went on strike on three different occasions. They went on strike between Jan and Feb, in June and from August to October in 2016.
“The laboratory scientists also embarked on strike from January to April in 2016 while nurses went on strike from Dec. 2015 to Jan. 2016.
“But there is a better understanding now because we were able to resolve some of the issues raised'', the CMD said.

Even in the tiniest of apartments, your most precious possessions somehow vanish when you need them most. In a bid to make messy people slightly less late, TrackR has announced a new range of item locator tags. The TrackR pixel tag is its new keyring-like device, allowing you to track any item within your home or beyond. The company has switched from aluminum to plastic, meaning that the pixel is cheaper than its predecessor. In addition, the device gains an LED light that'll help you find it in the dark.
Instead of just providing a vague location for your missing items, TrackR promises that it's the latest product will lead you straight to them. That's because the new tags work with atlas, a series of WiFi plugs that uses the company's cloud-based platform to map out your home. With it, users can create floorplans of their building on the TrackR app, alerting them whenever a tagged item enters or leaves a given room.
The deadly New Year's attack on a ritzy Istanbul nightclub has brought more turmoil to Turkey and shown how the conflict in neighboring Syria easily can spill over to threaten Europe's stability.
The mass shooting's bleak coda came into sharp relief Monday: Islamic State militants claimed the "heroic soldier" who gunned down revelers with a high-powered rifle at the jam-packed Reina nightclub as one of their own as police tried to find the fugitive, who is believed to have escaped in the mayhem they caused.
The assault that happened in the second hour of 2017 bookended another holiday season terror in Europe — the Dec. 19 attack at a Christmas market in Berlin. Both IS-linked assaults were carried out with the simple, low-tech approach that seems to be gaining favor with extremists.
In Berlin, a Tunisian extremist drove a large truck into the crowded market, killing 12. The Istanbul gunman killed a police officer and security guard outside the nightclub, then opened fire with an automatic rifle inside, leaving a total of 39 dead and dozens wounded.
This is the reality facing Europe as the Islamic State group loses territory in Syria and Iraq, but maintains followers, returning fighters and sleeper cells in the West eager to launch attacks.
———
POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THE ATTACK
The Islamic State group has many countries in its sights, and has claimed credit for high-profile attacks on France, Germany and Belgium while threatening Britain time and again. Turkey, which shares a large, porous border with Syria, is an appealing target because it is a NATO ally of the United States that has attacked IS positions in both Syria and Iraq.
For IS militants facing the loss of territory that comprises part of their self-proclaimed caliphate, carrying out successful attacks in other countries is an important reminder that the group still is a force to be reckoned with — and feared. And it is relatively easy for IS sympathizers to infiltrate Turkey and to move around in densely populated urban areas.
The Reina nightclub might have been chosen because it is popular with an international clientele and well-to-do locals, including many from the worlds of entertainment and sports. It also serves alcohol, which is prohibited on IS-held territory. The Reina had a strong security detail, but the gunman opened fire on a police officer and a civilian outside the club and quickly gained entry.
Once inside, it was not difficult to claim many victims. But their ability to kill so many and still elude police is worrisome — and has left Turkey on edge.
———
TURKEY'S VULNERABILITY
Turkey's location as a crossroads linking Europe and the Middle East has made it susceptible to rising tensions and rival factions throughout the region and brought in a huge number of migrants trying to get to western Europe.
Before the nightclub shootings, the country already had endured attacks from Islamic State militants and Kurdish separatists. There were dozens of substantial attacks last year alone as extremists tried to spread instability and damage the important tourist industry.
The list reads like a primer on modern terror tactics: a coordinated attack on the Istanbul airport in June that killed 44, a January suicide bombing that killed 12 German tourists, an August suicide attack on a Kurdish wedding party that killed at least 51 celebrants, and many others.
The cycle of violence, and a failed military coup in July that claimed about 270 lives, has led President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to take a more authoritarian approach. The government is also seeking to crack down on websites and social media users who praise extremist actions.
———
HOW CAN EUROPE PREVENT MORE ATTACKS?
Shifting extremist tactics have created new challenges for security agencies. Police and intelligence agencies say that "soft" public targets like nightclubs and sporting events are virtually impossible to comprehensively defend; there are too many of them. And as the Berlin, Istanbul and earlier attacks in France and Belgium brutally illustrated, a person with an automatic weapon or a heavy truck is armed with deadly force.
Extra layers of security, and some impregnable physical barriers, were added at some European landmarks for New Year's Eve celebrations to prevent a repeat of the Berlin attack, but it would not be possible to protect every popular club in every city and town.
The potential targets are plentiful and symbolic: In Berlin, a Christmas market long part of the city's festive tradition, in Istanbul, a New Year's party that represents Turkey's partial embrace of Western-style revelry.
The Berlin gunman escaped the scene and managed to cross into France and then Italy, where they were shot dead by police in a confrontation near Milan. In Istanbul, police say they have the gunman's fingerprints and a general description. Turkish officials said Tuesday they are close to being able to identify him, but where they remain at large is unknown.
The gameplay of OFDP2 is very similar to its predecessor. The player does not move around the screen to engage enemies, but rather must patiently wait for them to step within striking distance. A single button controls punches to the left, another handles punches to the right. Despite the simple control scheme, the action doesn't get stale thanks to the game's 700-some strike animations which are randomly evoked as you play. That way no two sessions are quite the same. It also helps that there are dozens of various weapons strewn throughout each level, ranging from simple staves and spears to throwing stars, chainsaws, axes, sniper rifles and even energy sabers with which to slaughter the mobs opposing you.
I also really enjoyed that the mini-games -- such as fending off waves of enemies using your throwing knives or cutting down opponents while on horseback -- are integrated directly into the levels themselves, rather than taking you out of the action while they load. Boss fights are also much improved from the original game, with powerful mini-bosses showing up and fighting right alongside their cannon-fodder minions.
The sequel also incorporates a number of new game styles. In addition to the standard story and survival modes, One Finger 2 will offer Rogue Mode in which you have a single life to beat the entire story, as well as tag team-style co-op. For all four modes, players will have the option to increase the game difficulty by removing the attack bar at the bottom of the screen that indicates when enemies are within punching range.
One Finger Death Punch 2 is slated for release in Spring 2019 on Xbox and PC. The company hopes to then port the title to PSN and Switch. There are no plans currently to port it to mobile as the first one was. The game is expected to retail for around $8.

Now, Trump being probed for possible obstruction of justice
Report indicates special counsel Mueller to probe Trump on possible obstruction of justice
Washington, United States | AFP | The special counsel overseeing the probe into Russia's alleged meddling in the US election is looking at whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice, The Washington Post reported Wednesday, citing unnamed officials.
In a pivotal shift in the investigation that has riveted Americans like no other in decades, senior intelligence officials have agreed to be interviewed by investigators working for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, the Post said.
It quoted five people briefed on the requests and said those who have agreed to be interviewed are Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, Admiral Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, and their recently departed deputy, Richard Ledgett.
The interviews could come as early as this week, the Post said.
The newspaper's story was met with a furious reaction from Trump's personal lawyer and the Republican National Committee.
The shift toward investigating the US president began days after Trump fired James Comey as FBI director on May 9, the Post said.
The stated focus has been Russia's alleged efforts to tilt last November's presidential election Trump's way, and whether the winner's campaign was involved in any way.
Trump vehemently denies any collusion between themselves or any of their associates and Russia.
Mueller, themselves a widely respected former head of the FBI, has now taken up the angle of possible efforts by Trump to obstruct justice in the investigation, the Post said.
Quoting officials, the newspaper said one event of interest to Mueller is an exchange on March 22, when Coats told associates that Trump had asked them to intervene with Comey to get them to back off the focus on Trump's former national security advisor Mike Flynn as part of the FBI probe of the Russia affair.
A few days after the March 22 meeting, Trump spoke separately with Coats and Rogers and asked them to issue public statements to the effect that there was no evidence of coordination between their campaign and Russia. The Post said both men refused the president's request.
Trump's personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz issued a statement saying the FBI was behind the Post story and called the leak “outrageous, inexcusable and illegal.” The lawyer did not deny the story, however.
Mueller briefed Senators Wednesday on their work.
“I'm going to acknowledge we had a meeting with the special counsel Mueller, but I'm not going to get into the contents,” Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters later.
Republican National Committee chairperson Ronna McDaniel called the accusation in the Post unfounded and said it “changes nothing.”
“There's still no evidence of obstruction, and current and former leaders in the intelligence community have repeatedly said there's been no effort to impede the investigation in any way. The continued illegal leaks are the only crime here,” McDaniel said in a statement.

Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.
Silicon Valley, California, 13 June. Cryptocurrency wallet provider Bitquence announced today that it will open its token crowd sale on June 28. The Silicon Valley startup is launching the first digital mobile wallet with portfolio management features backed by its own liquidity network, in a bid to increase the utility and usability of cryptocurrency. The crowd sale has a target of 5000 ETH to cover the costs of developing and launching the platform. The platform will run on BQX tokens which cover management and storage fees, and also create liquidity through the network. Contributors in ETH will be eligible for early beta access to the Bitquence platform.
PLATFORM FOR TOKEN MANAGEMENT
Bitquence works by offering pre-curated ‘baskets' of cryptocurrencies to users to help manage their altfolio. Baskets can be selected from ‘big cap' tokens, privacy tokens and even crowd sale tokens, and all token allocations will be backed 1:1 to safeguard platform users. Users can choose what tokens to acquire according to a consensus mechanism within Bitquence that allows participants to vote on the potential of a token. This enables you to measure risk and allows Bitquence to synthesize the needs of experienced cryptocurrency users with those new to the field, all from within an accessible and hyper-safe, mobile digital wallet.
“We can see the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies through a market cap that now surpasses $100 billion, but the tools to help the community are way behind the curve. Our aim at Bitquence is to accelerate the digital economy by providing much-needed guidance on asset allocation within the cryptocurrency market. Our platform users can simultaneously purchase many tokens instead of having to own and manage multiple wallets and thereby restore the original democratic intent of the new digital economy.” Shingo Lavine, CEO, Bitquence
THE BITQUENCE TEAM
Bitquence is comprised of a team of mobile technology and cryptocurrency experts with a track record of delivering mobile and technology solutions for multiple high profile clients. The team are very pleased to have the support of Godel Prize winner Maurice Herliphy, an expert on Ethereum Smart Contract and Distributed Autonomous Organisations, and Adam Lavine whose mobile technology has reached over 60 million consumers spanning 15 billion unique consumer interactions. Adam has built dozens of mobile products for Fortune 100 U.S. companies and carriers, and served as Chair for the MMA's Mobile Standards Committee, defining industry standards for the multi-billion dollar mobile compliance segment. With such a unique and strong team Bitquence is well positioned to redefine participation in cryptocurrency markets.
The BQX token sale will open on 28 June at 2:00 pm UTC. Funds raised will be used to develop and launch the platform, as well as ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Participants will be able to acquire BQX tokens at a rate of 3175 per ETH up to a soft cap of 40,000 ETH. The first contributors will have access to BQX tokens at a rate of 5000 ETH, which will move at a sliding scale to 3175 during the course of the token sale. The BQX token will power usage of the Bitquence platform, as well as contribute to the Bitquence Digital Liquidity Network and development of the Bitquence platform.
Bitquence's vision is to create a people-powered new economy services company that makes the cryptocurrency market accessible and trustworthy to the average user. It aims to accelerate adoption of blockchain technology and democratize ownership of cryptocurrencies bringing the future of money to today.

Re: No alternative to JAMB
By Manyike Chuka
I was happy to read Levi Obijiofor's column published in The Sun newspaper of last Tuesday, 11 April 2017. The article was entitled “JAMB and UTME: A life in denial.”
I want to begin by stating clearly that there is no alternative to the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), as the central authority tasked with responsibility for conducting examinations for admission into Nigerian universities. If JAMB is scrapped and its responsibilities are handed over to universities, everyone can expect the worst. It will mean that the university admission process will be compromised and hijacked by vice-chancellors, politicians, senior government officials and people with money to influence the process. Indeed, the admission process will be subject to abuses. In that new environment, vice-chancellors will employ all their kinsmen whether they are qualified or not. The affluent members of our society will dictate and influence who is admitted into universities. In that context, university admission will become another scam.
If JAMB is scrapped, this is the scenario that will confront everyone. It means that anybody who wants to go to university but does not have somebody to help them will have to forget about university education. Poor but brilliant students will bid farewell to university education. All kinds of abuses will take place. It will become possible for students to gain admission without sitting for the entrance examination. In fact, the level of corruption in the universities will be unprecedented. The result is that our graduates and their certificates will be unemployable and worthless. Everything will be bastardised. Is this the future of university education we envision for the country? Is this what we want for our students and our universities? Is this how to strengthen the quality of university education in Nigeria?
There is no alternative to JAMB. JAMB offers equal opportunity to both the rich and the poor to acquire higher education. I sat for the JAMB examination in 1978. I am a medical doctor (paediatrician). In the 1970s and 1980s, the type of chaos and confusion that characterise JAMB today did not exist. This was chiefly because of the competence, discipline, exposure, and experience of the people who administered examinations into universities in those days. Again, the students who sat for the examinations were more mature, more committed, more self-driven and more disciplined.
What is happening today in JAMB is lack of competence, lack of exposure, indiscipline and lack of experience on the part of officials who administer JAMB. Today, JAMB is seen as a metaphor for a failed state, as a reflection of the problem with the Nigerian state. Confusion is the unofficial synonym for JAMB. Candidates spend all their time searching for centres to register for JAMB examinations. Some of the students will be preparing also for the West African School Certificate Examination (WASCE). Some of them have come from rural areas with no computer skills, no exposure to regular supply of electricity, and, above all, with all these disadvantages, the students are expected to write computer-based examinations. These students constitute what we refer to metaphorically as “dead on arrival”. The expression implies the students have failed even before they have entered the examination hall.
JAMB embraced new technologies hurriedly without consideration for so many things. JAMB introduced computer-based examinations when the infrastructure is not universally available and accessible. There is no electricity in some rural areas, no ICT centres in many rural and remote areas. How could anyone in the right frame of mind compel students, who do not have basic computing skills to sit for computer-based examinations?
Amid this injustice and unfairness, you will find that in some ICT and registration centres, the operators are as confused as JAMB officials. Students are subjected to all manner of humiliation. They arrive at the centres as early as 6.30am and stay till 8pm; that is more than 12 hours during which no one attends to them. In the end, the students return home dejected because they did not get registered. This has been the case since the registration started.
This year, JAMB made it compulsory that candidates must have their personal email addresses. This created another level of problem. Candidates spent valuable time again trying to scale the hurdle set up by JAMB. They wasted yet another time at the banks to make payments. It has all been frustration and lamentation all the way, both for candidates and their parents. When will they candidates find time to prepare, read and pass this examination? Will this happen when candidates have fewer than three months to prepare for the examination? Keep in, as stated earlier, that some of them are also preparing for WASCE. How will they cope? These are undoubtedly deliberate obstacles set up to ensure many of the candidates would not pass the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and the WASCE.
Whenever JAMB officials appear on television to address the nation on what is happening, they appear soundly confused, providing clear evidence that they do not have answers to the problems they are trying to solve. JAMB introduced what they call mock examination. You have to ask who and what are they mocking? Now, suddenly, on the day of the mock examination, after all the candidates had assembled, they were informed the mock examination had been cancelled. What is a mess? What confusion?
Regardless of this glaring incompetence, I insist there is no alternative to JAMB. Government should strengthen JAMB and make it customer-friendly by reducing and or eliminating the frustrations encountered by candidates. To achieve this, government should strengthen the leadership of JAMB. Square pegs have to be placed in square holes. The leadership of JAMB has to be competent, disciplined, exposed, experienced, knowledgeable and should have a long-range vision. Above all, the person in charge should be a performer, an achiever, and must possess people-to-people skills. High academic title should not be a prerequisite for appointment of the chairperson of JAMB. That one is a professor does not mean that one has most of the attributes to occupy the position, as the chief executive of JAMB.
JAMB should be proactive. It should stop experimentation and, therefore, toying with the lives and educational career of many youths. JAMB must stop engaging in trial-and-error. There is no reason JAMB cannot start preparations for another UTME right after concluding one. If a new book will be introduced, as was done for the 2017 examination, candidates should be informed immediately the decision has been taken, so that prospective candidates will acquire and start reading the book. Candidates must be accorded sufficient time to read any new book introduced by JAMB. We must keep in mind that candidates read books not only to prepare for the UTME but also for development of knowledge. No one should expect students to read any book exhaustively and understand it in less than three months, given the confusion created by JAMB, coupled with the fact that some of the candidates are also preparing for or are sitting the WASCE.
It is the responsibility of JAMB to ensure that the UTME does not clash with the WASCE. This is necessary because candidates preparing or sitting for the WASCE cannot cope with UTME at the same time.
It is not enough to empower JAMB. Government should ensure that all secondary schools, both rural and urban, have access to new technologies. Schools must be equipped with computers and electricity or generators to facilitate use of the computers. Without this facility, without students acquiring basic computing skills, JAMB must be compelled to scrap the so-called computer-based test.
JAMB should not restrict candidates' choices of institutions. Candidates should be allowed to choose their institutions and courses of study, as was the case previously. Each candidate must have a choice of selecting three universities and three degree programmes. Today, candidates are restricted to the choice of just one university, a polytechnic, a college of education, etc. This is too restrictive. It does not serve anybody's interest.
JAMB should ensure that there are as many registration centres as possible, both in rural and urban areas. Some candidates travel long distances from rural areas to cities to register, and some could not register the day they travel to a city. This raises the logistical problem of where the students will stay overnight. They encounter all manner of hardships just to register for the exam. Registering to sit for the UTME should be a thing of joy, a pleasurable exercise and not a punitive and frustrating experience. With many centres available to students, registration can be completed in two weeks. Students should not experience horrors all for the reason that they are preparing to sit an examination. The examination can be completed in one day. In the days when examinations were conducted manually (i.e., the paper and pencil mode of examination), it used to take less than three hours to complete the JAMB examination. Why can't it be so in this digital era?
All the problems that emanate from JAMB border on incompetence and inexperience: The bane of leadership. JAMB must postpone the 2017 UTME until a week after the WASCE.

Perhaps the cool and rainy days of winter make you not so cheery and the blazing hot days of late summer drive you crazy. Spring seems to be a perfect compromise.
With temperatures in the 60s and 70s, puffy white clouds roll across the sky as winter lingers with snow covering portions of the distant mountains. Here are birds, bees, flowers and leaves all coming to life as the season changes once again in Orange County.

Former Africa Revenge frontman Willis Wataffi says they are in the process of re-growing their signature dreadlocks which they cut off in January as a way of mourning their brother and parents.
After death claimed both their parents last year, another tragic incident followed as Wataffi lost the only person they were left with in their life, their brother Marshall.
Their new hairstyle of a funky fade hair cut which The Chronicle spotted at the recently held prestigious Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards (RoilBAA) was a sign that the Afro-fusion artiste was planning to grow their hair and plant back their 20-year-old dreadlocks.
The artiste, who returned to Harare on Sunday, in an interview, revealed that they had since healed from mourning the death of their brother and parents. As such, they are now re-growing their locks as they feel they have respected the dead and followed the proceedings of their culture.
“I'm from a royal family in Mashayamombe, therefore if we lose our loved ones we mourn them. In my case, after the death of my brother in January, I removed my dreadlocks as a way of mourning him.
“I'll mourn them in spirit forever, but I'm done with the requirements of our traditional ritual. I'm now in the process of re-growing my dreadlocks,” said Wataffi.
Meanwhile, Wataffi praised the organising committee of the RoilBAAs saying they had followed international standards and were undoubtedly the best awards event that the whole of Zimbabwe has ever seen. The Chronicle

Anti-corruption Fight, Good Omen For Nigeria – Shekarau
Former minister of Education, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, has lauded the anti corruption fight by President Muhammadu Buhari, describing it as a good omen.
The former Kano State governor, made this disclosure to newsmen in Sokoto, yesterday.
Shekarau said, ” The efforts by the president to fight corruption in all its ramifications is good for Nigeria.
”Anybody, who gets any money fraudulently should be arrested, thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.
”I am a strong advocate of anti corruption fight, as I set up an anti corruption and public complaints commission in Kano State in 2005.
The chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), however, cautioned against selective justice in the anti corruption war.
Shekarau further urged that ”nobody should be above the law in this direction; there should also be respect, adherence and respect for the rule of law.
”You are innocent until you are proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt,” the former minister added.
On security, Shekarau called for improved funding of the nation's security agencies.
This, they noted, would ensure the provision of ultramodern weapons, logistics, training, retraining, as well as the need to improve their welfare.
On agriculture, the former governor called for the reintroduction of commodity boards in the country.
They said: ”This will add value to farming, boost food security and encourage farmers.
”Food security is next to nothing and any nation that fails to provide it remains weak and vulnerable”.
On politics, Shekarau said,”PDP will bounce back and reclaim its lost glory in 2019.”

Today, Verizon announced a relationship with Columbus Yellow Cab to automate and streamline the cab reservation and payment process for its full fleet of cabs and drivers across Ohio. Columbus Yellow Cab will use Verizon's Share solution, designed to provide an easy entry to the sharing economy through IoT enabled platform technology to support state wide management of its growing fleet of vehicles.
Yellow Cab's drivers, known as Driver Partners, will leverage Verizon's Share Solution to more easily locate and rent available cabs, creating an on-demand, self-service approach to gaining access to vehicles. Normally, Driver Partners lease vehicles from Yellow Cab on a daily, weekly or longer basis, forcing Driver Partners to repeat basic administrative duties and adding wait times to passenger pickups. Verizon's Share solutions save Yellow Cab's drivers time and money by enabling fleet sharing city-wide.
Said Morgan Kauffman, CEO of Yellow Cab, "At Columbus Yellow Cab, we strive to provide the best possible experience, not only for our riders, but also for our Driver Partners. Verizon's Share solutions will help us further this goal by evolving fleet management technology for our dedicated team of drivers and facilitating easier vehicle reservation and tracking across the board."
The continued growth of ride sharing services and applications coupled with changing demographics and social preferences have encouraged cab companies, fleet managers and transportation providers to continue to innovate and stay competitive in the sharing economy - whether it's bicycle sharing, last-mile commuting services, rental equipment or transportation on campuses or at events, the new sharing economy is here to stay. Key drivers of the sharing economy are:
In addition to Yellow Cab, other companies working with Verizon's Share Solutions platform to reduce congestion, create "on-demand" self-service experiences, streamline services and help monetize idle assets include The Santa Clara Transportation Authority (VTA) and Swiftmile, the electronic bike (ebike) service; CruCar, a car sharing solution for airline crews, and A.A.S. Technologies, a security, networking and audio visual company.
Said Mike Toto, Product Director of IoT Solutions at Verizon, "Our work with Columbus Yellow Cab is yet another example of a private fleet owner improving asset usage and customer satisfaction by providing a better, friendlier on-demand experience - one that they've come to expect in the new sharing economy. We're seeing rental car companies, dealerships as well as public and private fleet owners in construction; recreation and even on university campuses implement similar solutions to stay ahead of the competition and provide services and experiences fit for the 21st century."
Verizon's work with Yellow Cab is one of many efforts underway to ensure the city of Columbus is technologically equipped and at the forefront of smart communities technology and services for its citizens.
Probe By EFCC, ICPC: FECA Management Denies Media Reports
By Tope Fayehun, Akure
The management of the Federal College of Agriculture, Akure (FECA) on Wednesday denied media reports that the Provost of the institution, Dr. Samson Odedina has been
dragged before anti-graft agencies for allegedly flouting a court judgment.
Some newspapers not (LEADERSHIP) ,had reported that the Provost of the college has been dragged before EFCC and ICPC for allegedly flouting a court judgment which ceded part of the institution land to a family in Akure, the state capital.
Refuting the reports , the Registrar of the institution, Dr. Pius Ade Adebisi ,described the allegations not only “untrue, but defamatory and libellous”.
Adebisi said, the College has not been invited by any agencies including EFCC and ICPC on the land issue.
The Registrar noted that , it was some individuals who claimed to have a State High Court judgment that are now trying to take over 113ha (almost half of College land) including farms, infrastructures and facilities put in place in 1957 on land acquired in 1949.
According to him, “Some individuals are currently using self – help illegally to destroy Federal Government properties in the name of executing the judgment, despite all appeals by Government, Security agencies to maintain status quo and stop destroying Federal Government properties without following due process.
“There is an existing appeal before the Court of Appeal (Appeal No CA/AK/199/16) and motion for injunction and stay of execution pending determination of appeal
“Activities of individuals who destroy Government land has been reported to appropriate Government agencies for prosecution
“The College has not been invited by any agencies including EFCC and ICPC on the land issue. Nobody goes to EFCC or ICPC for legally safeguarding against illegal takeover of Federal Government properties.
“Management therefore wishes to enjoin the general public to disregard any publications by individuals seeking to take over Government land without due process: they have resorted to unethical media war after the unsuccessful attempt at illegality.”

Okowa directs demolition of illegal structures in Asaba Airport
Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has directed the demolition of all privately-owned houses sited within the perimeter fencing of the Asaba International Airport.
The governor gave the directive on Tuesday while inspecting the ongoing resurfacing of the airport runway and other ancillary work to ensure the contractors delivered as promised in May.
They said any building within the perimeter fencing that had relevant documents would be paid compensation, adding that the focus was to ensure safety at the airport.
“We need to determine the perimeter of the airport to know where our land ends.
“We need to look at the buildings close to the airport if they have relevant approvals and if they have no relevant approvals, the buildings will go down.
“I have asked the Commissioner for Lands and Survey to take inventories for us to take necessary actions.

“If the owners of the buildings have relevant documents, they will be compensated because, what is foremost on our mind is safety,” Okowa said.
He, however, lauded the level of work done at the airport, adding that the contractor was working hard to beat the five weeks deadline for the reopening of the airport for commercial activities.
“The contractor is right on course and they will deliver before the deadline.
“We are concentrating on the runway which must be of international standards, and we are confident that we will get one of the best in the country.
“I am happy with the pace of work,” they said.
The Project Manager, Setraco Nigeria Limited, Mr Jihad Yaghi, thanked the governor for encouraging the company to speed up the delivery of the project.
They said that everybody was committed and working hard to ensure that the job was completed on schedule and according to specifications.
The Airport Special Project Director, Mr Austin Ayemidejor who took the governor and their team round the project site, assured that the contractor was working round the clock to deliver the project before the deadline and to specifications.

Not that you may necessarily mind. Earlier rumors had the new Surface starting at $400 without a keyboard -- it's aimed at students and people who would otherwise buy an iPad or a similarly affordable slate, not someone who wants a do-it-all workhorse. Dial your expectations down a notch and this may be fine for taking notes or catching up on Netflix.
Microsoft hasn't said anything about the tablet yet, but the FCC filings and growing leaks suggest that it's right around the corner. It's just as well, since Microsoft almost certainly wants to reel in the back-to-school crowd.
Southport High School helps Hope Panel Build
Posted February 14, 2017 in Around Town, Briefs, Community, In Our Schools, Opinion By Nicole Davis
Southport High School Help Build Hope Panel Build
*Editor's Note: The following letter was submitted from Southport High School:
“My fellow Community Advocate,
Thank you for your interest in the First Southport High School Help Build Hope Panel Build. I appreciate you taking time to learn more about this great endeavor.
I have organized this event to give the students and faculty of Southport High School the opportunity to give back to the community in a unique way, bringing my school together in a commitment to public service. We will take part in building the frame of a home that will later be completed by a partner of Help Build Hope and presented to a deserving family in our community.
This event is scheduled for April 15, 2017 and will last from 8:00 AM to around 3:00 PM, engaging roughly 115 volunteers. The build will take place in the main parking lot of Southport High School, located at 971 E. Banta Road, Indianapolis, Indiana 46227. Volunteers will organize into groups and begin building individual panels in the east parking lot. After the panels are completed, they will be fit together and added to the frame. Final group photos will be taken in front of the completed frame with the participating volunteers and sponsors.
The cost of holding this event consists of required fees and lumber (not including promotional material, t-shirts, or breakfast and lunch for the volunteers) and totals between $7,000 and $9,000.
In order to raise these funds, I am presenting several levels of sponsorship, ranging from $50 up to $2500. Each sponsorship level has a variety of associated benefits. A detail of these benefits are attached. As a sponsor, your contribution will assist Southport High School and Help Build Hope fund and complete this build for the deserving family.

BEIRUT (AP) — Kazakhstan says it has postponed talks aimed at firming up a Syrian cease-fire by one day.
The Kazakh Foreign Ministry says the talks, to be held in preparation for U.N.-brokered Syria negotiations in Geneva, will be postponed until Thursday. The ministry did not give a reason for the delay.
The two-day conference is aimed at bolstering a Dec. 30 cease-fire ahead of the U.N. talks slated to begin Feb. 23.
Kazakhstan hosted talks between rebels and the Syrian government in January to pave the way for the resumption of the U.N. process, which has been on hold since last April.
Rebels will send the same delegation to Thursday's talks, headed by Mohammad Alloush of the Islam Army rebel group.
The Trump administration has begun the process of rolling back tough fuel standards for America's car and light truck fleet.
The Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department have opened the public comment period on the rewriting of standards for greenhouse gas emissions for cars and light trucks for model years 2022-2025.
"We are moving forward with an open and robust review of emissions standards, consistent with the timeframe provided in our regulations," EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said Friday. The 45-day period allows for the public to comment about regulations before proposed changes.
Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules were first put into place after the OPEC oil crisis in the 1970s. During the Obama administration, the CAFE rules were toughened in the wake of the financial crisis and the car company bankruptcies. The new standards called for an increased reliance on electric vehicles.
Low gas prices and sluggish sales of alternative fuel vehicles have made meeting those standards tough, especially for those companies more reliant on larger vehicles. Earlier this year, the EPA announced it would reconsider a decision late in the Obama administration to make the rules permanent.
The auto industry has hailed the decision to reopen the fuel standards. With the announcement, Mitch Bainwol, president and CEO of the Auto Alliance, a group of auto manufacturers, says, "the Administration is fulfilling its commitment to reinstate the midterm evaluation of future vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards."
Environmental and consumer advocacy groups decried the move. "By reopening the midterm evaluation, EPA is bringing back questions that have already been asked and answered," said Consumers Union, the policy arm of Consumer Reports.
Shannon Baker-Branstetter with Consumer's Union says their organization's studies show people want to save money on gas. According to a recent survey, 90 percent of Americans want automakers to raise fuel efficiency. Baker-Branstetter says adds "In fact, consumers are especially concerned about the fuel efficiency of the crossovers and SUVs they've been gravitating toward in recent years."
"What kind of changes may or may not be introduced is far from clear", says Stephanie Brinley, senior automotive analyst, IHS Markit. The agencies are expected to expand the data used to make the determination, specifically taking into consideration consumer behavior, they say.
The public comment period allows the car companies and others to lobby to keep or make changes.
"Pressures from other government requirements and consumer interest in reducing fuel emissions are expected to continue to be aggressive," Brinley says.
Even if the U.S. scales back, they say, the movement toward higher standards will likely continue in other countries. Already this year, several countries said they would ban the sale of gasoline vehicles altogether within decades. Many analysts believe that rolling back fuel standards could jeopardize the near term future for electric vehicles.
Ekiti got N8.8bn Paris Club refund first tranche – PDP
Ado-ekiti—The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State has dismissed claim by the Progressives Congress, APC, in the state that N9.5 billion was received by the state as first tranche of the Paris Club refund, saying that “Ekiti State and the 16 Local Councils received N8.8 billion out of which the State got N5.4 Billion and the Local Councils got N3.4 billion and no kobo has been received as second tranche of the refund by any State in the country.”
In a statement yesterday, by State publicity Secretary of the party, Mr Jackson Adebayo, the party said Nigerians were aware of the fact that the Nigeria Governors' Forum (NGF) hired a team of consultants to help secure the repayment of the over-deducted funds from the Federal Government when the FG was dragging its feet on the issue.
“It is even an irony that states and local councils in Nigeria are being treated like beggars on the refund of money belonging to them that was illegally deducted by the federal government. It is sad that instead of the federal government refunding the money it illegally deducted with apology to the States and Local Councils, it is the one giving terms,” the PDP said.
The party said it was funny that the same APC that ran the State aground, plunging the State into the debt that has caused financial embarrassment to the State during its four years rule is the one trying to get back to the minds of Ekiti people through false information.
“Everyone in Nigeria would also recollect that the consultants collected a certain percentage of the funds released to the 36 States of the federation and the FCT as consultancy fees and the issue of consultancy fees became a national issue as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) investigated the matter for several months,” the party said.

A new study attempts to put to rest one of the most common questions we hear in 7 On Your Side - what is the best time to buy a plane ticket?CheapAir.com crunched the numbers , based on 917 million airfares.They found there is no real difference in airfare when youthe flight, so you can find a deal any day of the week. However, there is a difference inyou fly.The cheapest flights can be found by traveling on a Tuesday or Wednesday. By contrast, Sunday is the most expensive day to fly.CheapAir found that opting for a Wednesday over a Sunday flight will save you, on average, $76 a ticket.The website also found that prices change about 62 times per trip - which is roughly every five days.In 2017, the bestto buy was about 70 days in advance.Global wine production in 2017 hit a historic low, which means the price you pay at the store may go up.The International Organisation of Vine and Wine report found production especially dropped in countries like Italy, France, Germany, and Spain, because of poor weather conditions last year.Demand for wine kept growing last year, with the U.S. coming in at number one for wine consumption.Experts told CNN the impact will most be felt by winemakers who charge less per bottle - because they have a lower profit margin and can't absorb changes in supply and demand as easily.Automaker Audi announced a massive international recall of cars and SUVs, because of problems with the electric coolant pumps. The pumps can overheat and potentially catch fire.The recall impacts 390,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada. It includes the following models, all with two-Liter turbocharged engines:2013 - 2016 Audi A42013 - 2017 Audi A52012 - 2015 Audi A62013 - 2017 Audi Q5 SUVIn government documents, Audi says the pumps can become blocked with cooling system debris, or moisture could cause an electrical short.Dealers will provide pump replacements at no charge. The redesigned pumps won't be available until November. In the meantime, dealers will install a new version of the current pump.
KASUKABE, Japan — The cavernous underground cisterns here north of Tokyo could hold the Statue of Liberty, a scale that underscores the site's immense task: protecting the world's most populous metropolis from flooding.
Linked by tunnels that divert water away from the region's most vulnerable floodplains, the $2 billion underground anti-flood system, completed in 2006, is an extraordinary example of the defenses that global cities are readying as they face an era of extreme weather brought on by climate change.
In the United States, towns and cities battered by a string of devastating hurricanes are just starting to come to terms with what it could take to bolster their storm protections. Houston city officials have pleaded for state and federal funds to help build a new $400 million reservoir that could keep storm water from inundating downstream neighborhoods.
“We're preparing for flooding beyond anything we've seen,” said Kuniharu Abe, who heads up the underground site. “Until now, at least, we've been successful.”
Since this issue is in the spotlight again, Guido brings you a reminder that the Remain campaign did exactly the same thing that Vote Leave is accused of, only far, far worse. In the month before the vote the Remainers set up FIVE new campaigns and funnelled a MILLION pounds into them so they could stay under the spending limit:
DDB UK Ltd registered as an independent campaign on 25 May 2016, less than a month before the referendum. DDB UK Ltd received £191,000 in donations.
Best For Our Future registered as a permitted participant on 27 May 2016, less than a month before the referendum. It received £424,000 in donations
The In Crowd registered on 10 June 2016, less than two weeks before the referendum. It received £76,000 in donations.
Virgin Management Ltd registered as a permitted participant on 3 June 2016, less than three weeks before the referendum. It received £210,000 in donations.
Wake Up And Vote registered as a permitted participant on 24 May 2016, less than a month before the referendum. It received £100,000 in donations.
The Remain campaign did exactly the same thing as Vote Leave, only with more money and with five new campaigns…
There are two sides to the story! Well, after harassing our receptionist… Melissa's husband got through the POWER lines . This is NOW the craziest LIVE call our show has ever received!
NEW YORK (AP) -- Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is on indefinite leave from the company they co-founded while an internal investigation into numerous sexual harassment allegations against them is completed.
The board of directors of The Weinstein Co. said Friday that Weinstein's future with the company depends on their therapeutic progress and the results of the internal investigation.
The announcement came a day after The New York Times reported that Weinstein has over the years reached at least eight legal settlements with women over alleged harassment.
"We believe it is important to learn the full truth regarding the article's very serious accusations, in the interests of the Company, its shareholders and its employees," the company said.
The statement is signed by four of six remaining board members.
The board named attorney John Kiernan of the firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP as the head of the internal investigation. It did not give a time frame for when the investigation would be completed.
The statement says it is essential for The Weinstein Co. to have a culture where women can work with respect and without fear of harassment or discrimination.
The New York Times expose chronicled allegations against Weinstein from actor Ashley Judd and former employees at both the Weinstein Co. and Weinstein's former company, Miramax
Leadership of The Weinstein Co. will be assumed by Weinstein's brother, Bob Weinstein, and David Glasser, the company's chief operating officer and president.
The Weinstein Co. board of directors has pressured Weinstein to step down from the company they helped create, said a person familiar with the board's deliberations who was not authorized to speak publicly. Weinstein has resisted, hoping to weather the storm. Discussions between Weinstein and the board have been heated and contentious, the person said.
Weinstein on Thursday issued a lengthy statement that quoted Jay-Z and asked for "a second chance." They and their lawyers, including Charles J. Harder, have also in statements and interviews criticized the New York York Times' report, though neither has referenced anything specific.
The Weinstein Co. board of directors are composed largely of investors like Tudor Group founder Paul Tudor Jones and WPP Group executive Lance Maerov. Board member Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor, resigned Thursday.
Messages to Ziff and current board members were not returned Friday.
In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Weinstein attorney Lisa Bloom both defended Weinstein and acknowledged he'd been "stupid." They saluted the women who have come forward to allege wrongdoing but said many allegations were overblown and consisted of Weinstein telling a woman they "looked cute without my glasses."
Congressional Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and potential 2020 presidential contender Elizabeth Warren, on Friday began giving charities thousands of dollars in donations they had received from the disgraced Hollywood titan.
Weinstein and their family have given more than $1.4 million in political contributions since the 1992 election cycle, nearly all of it to Democratic lawmakers, candidates and their allies, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Eminem's Revival is, finally, less than a week away. The rollout has left plenty to be desired, sure, and the singles have received relatively lukewarm receptions, but any time one of the biggest rappers ever decides to release an album it's a momentous occasion. And it seems like Em is pulling out all the stops, giving their fans a unique opportunity to purchase several special editions of the album, including one very expensive option that includes Shady's own autograph.
Em unloaded a handful of ways for their fans to buy the new album on their website, including digital copies in tandem with either a t-shirt or a hoodie, but they upped the ante as well, offering copies of Revival along with collectors items like dog tags, or a steel print of the lyrics from “Walk On Water,” and finally, their autograph for a whopping $500.
Eminem
This approach isn't exactly groundbreaking, even if it is rare. Nipsey Hussle did something similar back in 2015 when they sold $1,000, limited edition copies of their mixtape Mailbox Money, which included, amongst other things, an invitation to a special listening session of an unreleased album, hosted by Nipsey himself. The strategy is simple: you sell the fans an experience, not necessarily the music they can already get for free with minimal Googling. Eminem is utilizing that line of thinking now too, and while $500 may seem like a lot for an album, there are going to be diehard Slim Shady fans showing up in spades for the chance to cop their John Hancock.

There are certain pro wrestling moves that you'd absolutely kill to see delivered in the context of an MMA fight. A Go 2 Sleep, a Hulk Hogan-style big leg drop … heck, I'd give a whole lot of money to see an MMA fighter do that thing where they pat their own elbow before delivering an elbow drop to a grounded opponent.
And then there are the pro wrestling holds that you wonder why you DON'T see them a million times in real fights. Everyone here at With Spandex loses their mind any time there's an MMA fight with a shoot powerbomb or German suplex. It's just exciting as hell. And it sort of outs hardcore MMA fans as secret pro wrestling enthusiasts, also, because that stuff is undeniably badass.
On Sunday night, an MMA fighter used a pro wrestling maneuver that I've never seen utilized in a shoot fight before, and never thought of someone using it. But after seeing it … damn, this is effective as hell. Why doesn't EVERYONE use this? I'm referring, of course, to the noble dragon sleeper.

Disgraced footballer Adam Johnson's County Durham mansion is up for sale with a reduced price tag of £1.7m.
The former Sunderland star and ex-England winger, put the five bed-roomed pad on the market last summer after losing an appeal against their conviction and six-year jail sentence for sexual activity with a girl of 15.
Adam Johnson
The mansion called Tollgate Lodge, in Castle Eden, was originally put up for sale for the price of £1.9m, but is now on the market for £200,000 less.
Estate agents Fine and Country were unable to comment on the reduction, but have called the house - located on the edge of the conservation village of Castle Eden - is a ‘dream home.'
The property was designed in 2009 by award-winning architect Colin Wardle, of Morpeth-based Design Two.
It features around two acres of land, a games room with a bar, private gym and a cinema room.
One of the many hallways in the mansion.
Other features include electric gates, landscaped gardens and a sweeping drive bordered by lawns and trees concluding in a triple garage.
The 29-year old's football shirts and England caps have been removed from the mansion, which they had shared with girlfriend Stacey Flounders, mum to their daughter, when they groomed the fan.
Their family claimed they were wrongly convicted and campaigned to set them free.
Johnson is currently in prison at HMP Moorland near Doncaster.
The mansion contains a private gym.
Describing the home on the Fine and Country website, estate agents said: “Primarily a family home, at its heart is a fabulous dining kitchen leading open plan into a family room and beautiful garden room with French doors leading out to a sunken patio area for outdoor eating and entertaining.”
Features of the £1.7m house:
* Five en-suite double bedrooms
* Five reception rooms
One of numerous bathrooms at the property.
* Cinema room The house has multiple bedrooms with en-suites.
* AstroTurf putting green

Chanel Bonds says DPW left this hole in front of their driveway two years ago and still hasn't fixed it (Source: WAFB)
Chanel Bonds says DPW left this hole in front of their driveway two years ago and still hasn't fixed it (Source: WAFB)
There's a big square about two inches deep in the street in front of 13865 Broad Avenue, and the sidewalk to that home shifts when anyone walks over it or a car drives over it.
Chanel Bonds is the homeowner. The 9News Alert Team found out the Baton Rouge Department of Public Works (DPW) went to the location in 2016 to check on a sewage complaint. Workers dug up holes to check for water leaks. Bond says that's when the problems started.
"It started out as two holes when they came and dug. They came and dug in here and like I said, it escalated. The holes got bigger and bigger through time," said Bonds.
Bond says the crews also dug up holes in their neighbor's driveway, but they say those have since been fixed. Hers though, no one ever came to repair them. Now, Bonds says the hole is damaging their cars and the shifting sidewalk has become a hazard.
"My grandson was playing basketball maybe over a week or so ago and tripped over this and they scraped their knee, so my husband took it to another level and that's why they had to get in touch with you guys," said Bonds.
Bonds called the city-parish's 311 call center in front of the 9News Alert Team.
"I was calling about the issues I was having," Bonds told them.
They were transferred, just like they told us would happen. They were told their case had been handed over to a supervisor, who would be calling them back shortly. "I won't get the call today. They won't call me. I have heard this several and several times before: 'We are going to call you back,'" said Bonds.
No one called them back, so the 9News Alert Team called DPW asking why they kept getting tossed from one department to another for the past two years, with DPW saying it was the water company's responsibility and the water company putting it back on DPW.

GLENDALE, AZ - Arizona twins are going to have a unique story to tell for the rest of their lives after they were born in different years.
Holly and Brandon Shay weren't expecting their boys to arrive for another few weeks, however, they were shocked when Banner Hospital in Glendale admitted them on New Year's Eve.
After six exhausting hours of labor, their first son, Sawyer, was born at 11:51 p.m.
“I wanted to make sure they were OK, and they had to keep reminding me that I had to push," Holly said.
Just one minute after midnight on January 1, 2017, their second baby, Everett, was born.
The boys who previously shared nine months in the same space won't be sharing a birthday -- or even their birth year.
“I think Sawyer might give their brother a hard time,” Brandon said. “I think it's mostly going to be Sawyer teasing Everett over them being the eldest.”
Election: Nigeria Was Heading Towards Another Civil War In 2015, Says Amaechi
The Minister of Transport and former Rivers State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, on Tuesday said that only a few Nigerians were aware that the nation was heading towards another civil war in 2015 had the election results of that year been tampered with.
The minister made this known while speaking at the maiden edition of the CKN News annual lecture, held at the Renaissance Hotel, GRA, Ikeja, Lagos.
They also expressed grave concern about the degree of abuse on the social media, adding that if care was not taken, the abuse on the social media could destroy the country.
Speaking on the topic: “The Role of The Social Media in the Socio-economic and Political Development of Nigeria”, Amaechi, who noted that whilst the social media was generating huge funds on the one hand, it was also creating crimes on the other hand.
They further cited the instance of the recently apprehended kidnap kingpin, Chukwudidumeme Onuamadike, known as Evans, who claimed to have garnered information on their victims from the social media.
Amaechi explained that the removal of former President Goodluck Jonathan posed a bigger threat to the nation than the current agitation for Biafra, dismissing the possibility of a breakup in the country.
“The removal of President Jonathan was a bigger threat than Biafra. Nigeria was inching towards the civil war. So, forget the talk about secession; Nigeria cannot break up,” they said
The minister further said that the Muhammadu Buhari Campaign organisation used the social media effectively to expose some of the undercurrents as well as tame the possible outbreak of a civil war.
Amaechi, who noted that the social media had created jobs for more unemployable people than their employable counterparts, maintained that government was angry with the social media operators but also happy because they had been creating jobs.

HOUSTON — The Warriors wore NBA Finals hats on their heads and relieved smiles on their faces, but the words that came from their mouths were more grave than joyous: Rather than bask in a glorious victory, the defending champions recounted their near-death experience.
History will remember Golden State's 101-92 victory in Game 7 of the West finals as the night that Houston, exhausted and playing without an injured Chris Paul, missed 27 consecutive three-pointers, thereby opening the door for the Warriors' fourth straight Finals appearance. But before they frittered away their season with an unthinkable dry spell, the Rockets scared one of the most talented NBA teams ever assembled in ways that would have seemed impossible one year ago.
Trailing 54–43 and in disarray at the half, the Warriors were 24 minutes away from becoming the NBA's biggest underachievers of the 21st century. The 2004 Lakers lost in stunning fashion, but at least they made the Finals. The 67-win 2007 Mavericks were shocked in the first round, but they only had one perennial All-Star in Dirk Nowitzki. The 2011 Heat crumbled against the Mavericks, but their “Big 3” was in its first year together. The 2016 Warriors won a record 73 games and were the first team to blow a 3–1 Finals lead, but they were vanquished by prime LeBron James and they hadn't yet signed Kevin Durant.
The 2018 Warriors, by contrast, boast two MVPs and two more All-Stars, all in their primes and all with championship experience together. Failing to even make the Finals would have been a grave disappointment, the type that would have made it difficult to run it back next season without fundamental changes. Coach Steve Kerr alluded to these unforgiving stakes with a bit of dark humor.
“I was thinking of resigning, that was my first thought,” Kerr said, following Golden State's great escape. “I walked in at halftime, and I said, ‘I don't even recognize this team.' We've been together for four years. I didn't recognize the group that we were seeing.”
Story Continues
Indeed, for each of Golden State's key figures, this series represented a sharp departure from last year's joyride. During the 2017 postseason, the Warriors won so effortlessly, and in such charmed fashion, that their championship reign looked like it would extend indefinitely. Kevin Durant scored at will, Stephen Curry stepped forward whenever they were needed, and the two A-list superstars struck a seamless balance. Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala handled everything else of consequence with consistent, high-IQ contributions. The Warriors were such a well-oiled machine that they didn't skip a beat when Kerr was forced from the bench with health issues, and they cruised to convincing victories once they returned in the middle of the Finals. Some wondered: Did they even need a coach?
Against Houston, though, seam after seam started to come apart.
Durant and Curry looked exasperated with each other over a missed defensive assignment in Game 6. Durant and Green engaged in a profane back-and-forth following an early turnover in Game 7. Thompson picked up three fouls in the first four minutes of Game 7, even though they had insisted on staying in the game after they picked up their second in the opening minute. On multiple occasions during the series, Durant appeared clearly frustrated with Kerr when they were subbed out of the game.
Meanwhile, Durant and Curry struggled to play off each other, with Curry enduring multiple slumps and Durant regularly forcing shots in isolation. Green and Iguodala couldn't serve as bridges between the two superstars: The former displayed little confidence in their shot, while the latter missed the final four games of the series with a knee injury.
For all the harsh words and sources of internal tension, Golden State managed not to implode. Curry, who scored 19 of their 27 points in the second half, pointed back to a first-half turnover by Green as the Warriors' moment of truth.
“That's a point where you can have guys doing a lot of finger-pointing and blaming and getting in their feelings,” Curry said. “But there was a moment during that timeout where it was just really productive. Everybody was like, ‘Let's just move on.' Get it together, find a way to get through this little rough patch and just find ourselves. It just took a while.
“That moment, it could have splintered, to be honest. It could have been a moment where guys went their separate ways. But I think the way that we fought all year and the way that this team is built with the chemistry we have, that got us through that little rough patch.”
While the Warriors pulled themselves through some early miscues, they still needed to get their offense back on track. Durant, who led all scorers with 34 points, openly acknowledged being mired in a mental battle all series. Houston's switch-heavy defense forced Durant to think and to over-think. The Warriors' initial reaction to the switching was to force-feed Durant in isolation, a counter that produced success early in the series. The more Durant isolated, the more help Houston started to send, leading the All-Star forward to force tough shots and make ill-advised passes into traffic.
As the misses and turnovers mounted, Durant seemed to hear the outside noise that blamed their high usage rate for Golden State's choppy offense. They seemed to want to be the distributor that everyone expected them to be, but it wasn't coming naturally.
“Sometimes when you want it too much, you get in your own way,” Durant admitted. “I know all about that, especially after Games 4 and 5 for myself, personally, I felt that way. … The game is at a mental point in my career where I'm just trying to figure things out. The whole iso thing was a big thing around our team. We talked about it a lot. I was forcing, I was going too fast on my drives and on my moves. They had me just thinking too much out there.”
The cure was patience and trust. Golden State blitzed out of halftime for the second straight game, with Curry catching fire and Durant settling in. The Warriors were easily the league's best third-quarter team during the regular season, posting an astonishing +18.5 net rating, and they outscored the Rockets 33–15 in the third on Monday. The Rockets' run of errant shots relieved much of the pressure on the Warriors, who started to move the ball again and look like the team Kerr might be able to recognize. The fourth quarter was a blur of Durant daggers and Curry celebrations.
“It's amazing how long the NBA game is,” Kerr said. “There are so many opportunities to get yourself going as a team. With our team, there is just so much firepower that at some point, we're going to get going. … Steph seems to infuse us with energy. Kevin keeps us going with their methodical scoring. But when Steph and Klay get it going from three, that's when our team really seems to take off.”
There's no telling whether the Warriors will take the right lessons from this series, especially if they cruise past the weakened Cavaliers, as most expect. Will they remember just how close they came—via complacency, frustration and disjointedness—to being on the wrong side of an historic upset? Or, will they depart Houston emboldened, feeling like they only need to play to their full potential for a few quarters here and there to lord over the league?
Brushes with death are like that: They can lead to thorough self-evaluation and wholesale life changes, or they can be an invitation to simply carry on. As great as these Warriors are, this series proved that they're not untouchable, that they are susceptible to fatigue, injury, philosophical disagreements, ego clashes, and shooting slumps just like any of the NBA's other 29 teams.
If the Warriors bury or deny their newly-exposed weaknesses, they will be beaten or broken up far sooner than expected. While they survived the Rockets, their air of invincibility has perished.
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Authorities say suspects in the 1999 shooting deaths of an Oklahoma couple and the abduction of their 16-year-old daughter and their friend "bragged" about photographing the girls while they were bound.
Sixty-six-year-old Ronnie Dean Busick was charged Monday with four counts of first-degree murder in the killing of Danny and Kathy Freeman of Craig County, and the disappearance of teenagers Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman.
Oklahoma officials say two other suspects have died.
According to an affidavit, unnamed witnesses interviewed by investigators said the suspects abducted the girls, and that they had seen photos of them. Authorities believe the teenagers were eventually killed and might be buried in a pit in northeastern Oklahoma.
Lauria Bible's mother, Lorene Bible, says they believe "somebody knows where these girls are."
The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has urged the Nigeria Police, to fish out those behind the murder of Gombe United defender, Douglas Uzama . Uzama was killed in Benin City on December 29, 2016. The former Nigeria youth international, had travelled to celebrate the Yuletide with their family and was shot dead by suspected cultists. […]
Reigns: Them Majesty
Jessica Conditt
Senior Editor
I like to play a little game whenever I'm posted up somewhere with ample people-watching opportunities: It's called "Tinder or Reigns?" Playing Reigns: Them Majesty looks a lot like scrolling through Tinder -- one thumb swiping left or right -- and I enjoy guessing which app people are actually using as they're lost in their phones. I deeply hope (but supremely doubt) most folks are playing Reigns.
Reigns: Them Majesty is a sequel that functions a lot like the original mobile game: You're the ruler of an ancient kingdom, and on each turn you get to make a choice about how the whole thing is run. Each decision affects various aspects of the kingdom, such as finances, the church, public affection and the military. If your score in any of these topics gets too low -- or too high -- you're killed (usually in a brutal fashion) and you start up again as a new ruler.
There's so much more to it than that -- Reigns is a rich fantasy world populated by early science experiments, demons and witches, all veiled by the spectacle of palace intrigue. It's bite-sized and vast -- and so much more fun than Tinder.
Assassin's Creed: Origins
Timothy J. Seppala
Reporter
I'm a sucker for taking video game screenshots. It stems from my days writing reviews for print magazines where I had editors dead set against using the same press assets that everyone else had. This generation of hardware has made screenshotting incredibly easy, and has given rise to in-game photo modes. Typically, Sony's first party games set the bar for DSLR-like controls, but Assassin's Creed: Origins bucks that trend. Its feature set, combined with the atypical Egypt setting, mean making progress through the narrative is slow-going because I'm always stopping to grab a photo of an ancient temple or pyramid.
A lot of this comes down to how powerful the adjustable focus point and the depth of field controls are. I'm not limited to focusing on the center of a shot. Instead, Origins gives me full control of the focus point. Once I have composition set, clicking the left stick takes me to edit mode where, as I move the left stick about the frame, the focal point follows suit. From there, I'm able to adjust the depth of field slider to get the amount of bokeh I want. The depth of field looked like a cheap blur filter on my launch Xbox One, but the more powerful One X makes it look much more natural, in addition to pumping up the visual fidelity.
None of the screenshots I've taken will ever pass for DSLR photos, of course, but it's not like I have a time machine (or an animus) to take me back to Ra's Egypt. So, until science advances to the point where I can live out my ancestors' memories stored in my DNA, this will have to do.
Yakuza 0
Nick Summers
Associate Editor
At the core of Yakuza 0 is a gripping and tremendously well-written tale about murder, honor and revenge. If you follow the main storyline and ignore everything else, you'll have a great time fighting through the streets of Tokyo and Osaka as the game's dual protagonists Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima. You will, however, miss out on a massive part of what makes the series so special. Both cities are filled with people who have bizarre and occasionally heart-breaking stories to tell. Solve their problems and you'll feel closer to each neighborhood; a true protector with friends on every street corner.
I was passing through Ashitaba Park, for instance, when I spotted an older gentleman staring at a young boy. I was curious and a little concerned, so I walked over and said hello. It turns out the man, Akatani, was in so much trouble with the yakuza that they had to fake their death and surgically alter their face. Their wife and son have no idea that he's still alive; Akatani is afraid to approach them in case the mafia figures out their true identity and takes them as hostages. Instead, they watch their son, Yusuke, from afar in the park, forever longing to reach out and say hello.
I was surprised and moved by their story. As I ran across the city and completed other quests, I made sure to stop by and see how Akatani was doing. Their side-story develops in an unusual way; eventually, a group of mobsters grows curious and begin to question Akatani's history. I step in, of course, and scare them away with a few well-timed punches and roundhouse kicks. The family is a little confused but express their gratitude. Here, I expected Akatani to come forward and reveal their true identity to them. But because they knew full well the danger it would put them in, they didn't.
I couldn't help but respect the man, despite their criminal past. Eventually we said our goodbyes and I moved on, hungry for other adventures. But as the hours rolled by I kept thinking about Akatani and their sad, lonely existence. What they must have been going through as I gulped down ramen and played Space Harrier in the arcade. It made me feel bad. In the game, their side quest was over, but a large part of me wanted to reach out and somehow continue our strange friendship.
Yakuza 0 is filled with side stories like this. They enrich the world and make it feel like a real, lived-in place. If you haven't played the game yet, or if you completed it with a "critical path" mentality, I implore you to go back and look around for a while. What you'll find is just as valuable and rewarding as the main storyline. Plus, it's nice to just stop and smell the digital roses sometimes.
"IRL" is a recurring column in which the Engadget staff run down what they're buying, using, playing and streaming.
The storm surrounding “Confederate” started shortly after HBO announced in mid-July that the next project from the “Game of Thrones” creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff would be an alternate history drama in which the South successfully seceded during the Civil War, and government-sanctioned slavery was still a reality.
A backlash emerged, with some accusing HBO of being cavalier with the topic of slavery and the contemporary plight of black life in the United States. A social media campaign built around the hashtag #NoConfederate began trending on Twitter.

Several prominent writers denounced the series, including Ta-Nehisi Coates, who wrote in The Atlantic this month: “African Americans do not need science-fiction, or really any fiction, to tell them that that ‘history is still with us.' It's right outside our door. It's in our politics. It's on our networks.”
Then came this weekend's events in Charlottesville, where a rally of white nationalists turned into a series a melees and a 32-year-old woman was killed when a car sped into a crowd of counterprotestors.
One of the creators of the #NoConfederate campaign, April Reign, who also created the #OscarsSoWhite social media campaign, said that the events over the weekend were a reminder that “we have not fully reconciled what the Confederacy means.”
“How is this an alt-history when we have things like Charlottesville playing out?” they said in a telephone interview.
HBO defended the series in a statement on Monday.
“We support everybody's right to express an opinion but the suggestion of irresponsibility on our part is simply undeserved,” the network said. “HBO has a long history of championing intelligent storytelling and we will approach this project with the same level of thoughtfulness that has always defined our programming. We recognize the sensitivity of this project and will treat it with the respect that it deserves. Our creative partners should be given time to develop the series rather than face prejudgment.”

The backlash to the show has also spurred a debate about whether the #NoConfederate campaign constituted a form of censorship, because the criticism of the show developed before a script was even written. Judd Apatow, the television and movie producer, said on Twitter that “to criticize work before it exists is dangerous to all expression.”
HBO said that “Confederate” would not go into production until “Game of Thrones” was finished next year, meaning that it will probably be at least two years before the show is ready to air.
The network has dealt with pre-emptive furor before. In the months before the release of the science fiction drama “Westworld,” the network faced criticism that it was once again relying on sexual violence against women as a plot point in a prominent show. (“Game of Thrones” has also been subject to this criticism during its run, another reason that some thought Mr. Weiss and Mr. Benioff, who are both white, were less-than-ideal creators of a show that dealt with slavery.) But by time “Westworld” debuted, much of that had died down, and the first-year drama was showered with good reviews, strong ratings and numerous Emmy nominations.

In the meantime came the release on Sunday of more hacked episodes from upcoming series, including a new episode of “Insecure,” and several unaired episodes from “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and the new series “The Deuce,” which will form the backbone of HBO's fall lineup. (To complicate matters further for HBO, a producer of “The Deuce” will be sentenced Tuesday for their role in the fatal cocaine overdose of a 38-year old dermatologist).
The hacker, who refers to themselves as Mr. Smith, described this as the “third wave” of material. So far, the attack has remained relatively contained compared with the one involving Sony, which included a trove of embarrassing and racially insensitive emails that forced the studio's executives to publicly apologize and meet with civil rights activists. HBO has said that it did not believe its email system “as a whole” had been breached, though the hacker has had access to some emails and released a number from the account of one network executive.
The information released from the Sony theft was also eventually made available on WikiLeaks, making private emails easily searchable by the public.

In contrast, the HBO hacker has primarily released the material to members of the news media, and it is not clear how widely some of the hacked episodes have actually spread online. Further, the hacker has not released any upcoming episodes of “Game of Thrones,” HBO's crown jewel, which has two episodes left this season.
Mr. Smith has said that they want HBO to pay them a ransom for the rest of the material. On Monday, the hacker provided a copy of a letter that they had purportedly sent to HBO. “You disappointed us, so we will bring down your nasty empire,” it read.
HBO said in a statement that it was no longer in communication with the hacker, and that it would not comment on every bit of material that was released.
“The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention,” the network said. “That's a game we're not going to participate in. Obviously, no company wants their proprietary information stolen and released on the internet. Transparency with our employees, partners, and the creative talent that works with us has been our focus throughout this incident and will remain our focus as we move forward. This incident has not deterred us from ensuring HBO continues to do what we do best.”

Nigeria On The Verge To Unseat Angola As Africa's Largest Oil Exporter
Except for any unforeseen incident, Nigeria's crude oil export is expected to reach 1.84 million barrels per day (bpd) in July, 2017.
The new development is coming on the back of a recovery in Forcados exports, according to the nation's loading programmes seen on Wednesday.
Premium Times reports that Forcados exports resumed at the end of May after a nearly complete shutdown since February 2016.
This is even as the grade's operator, Shell's local subsidiary SPDC, issued an initial June schedule of 197,000 bpd.
“We resumed production at Forcados on June 6, 2017 after lifting the force majeure we declared on crude exports from the facility last year,” Shell spokesperson Precious Okolobo told AFP.
It, however, increased the schedule to 252,000 bpd.
With all set for world's most populous black nation to export about 1.84 million barrels per day (bpd) in July, Nigeria is expected to regain its status as Africa's largest oil exporter, a title it lost to Angola in 2016.
The loss followed militant attacks on the nation's oil infrastructure in the oil-rich Niger Delta region.
Shell had declared the force majeure on Forcados shipments in February 2016 after rebel group Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) bombed the main crude supply line to the terminal, causing massive spills in the area.
The subsea line was repeatedly attacked by rebels last year while undergoing repairs, forcing the oil giant to halt production.
Last year, several militant groups including the Avengers attacked oil facilities in Nigeria, slashing the nation's crude output and hammering government revenues.
The militants said they are seeking a fair share of the nation's oil wealth for local residents as well as political autonomy for the region.
Production has since improved, following peaceful negotiations with leaders from the region.
Angola's July exports are expected to be 1.55 million bpd, Reuters reports.
With a force majeure in place on Bonny Light, and loading delays of as much as 10 days, Nigeria's export plans for June and July are likely to change.
Force majeure is a legal term that frees a company from any contractual obligation due to circumstances beyond its control.

An increased risk of autism among children of women who took antidepressants during pregnancy may actually be the result of maternal mental illnesses, according to new research.
Up to 15 per cent of women has depression during pregnancy and antidepressants are a popular treatment choice for those with depression, Xinhua news agency reported.
However, there has been a long-standing debate about whether expectant mothers with depression should take antidepressants.
In a paper published by the US journal JAMA Pediatrics, Antonia Mezzacappa of the Bicetre University in France and colleagues reviewed and analysed 10 studies that have explored associations between fetal exposure to antidepressants and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).
“Based on our meta-analyses, there is a significant association between ASDs and prenatal maternal use of antidepressants. However, it appears to be more consistent during pre-pregnancy than each trimester,” the study noted.
The study also found that the association was weaker when past maternal illness of the mother was controlled for.
As a result, the study said the public health implications of the possible risk for ASDs as a result of antidepressant exposure during pregnancy are “difficult to assert or to refute, especially as we also observed an association with preconception exposure.”
“The increased risk for ASDs in children exposed in utero could well be related to maternal depression or other psychiatric disorders rather than to antidepressant medications per se,” it concluded.
Irene Petersen, a researcher at the University College London, who was not involved in the study, said it's tricky to study the exposure on antidepressants in pregnancy and the risk of ASDs, as the effects of drug treatment are often difficult to be separated from other risk factors such as maternal illnesses.
“The findings from this review suggest that antidepressant treatment may be a ‘marker' of women who may have an elevated risk of giving birth to a child with ASD,” Petersen said.
“However, I would be very cautious about reaching a conclusion that antidepressants treatment in pregnancy itself is causing autism. With the existing evidence, we still cannot exclude the possibility that it is maternal illnesses linked to ASD — and not the antidepressants,” they added.
We can, it seems, be sure of three things in this life: death, taxes and that any story concerning China's influence in our region will dominate the news cycle.
So it was when The Age reported on Monday that former foreign minister Bob Carr had been urging Labor Senator Kristina Keneally to grill the Prime Minister about the role and employment contract awarded to consultant and former adviser John Garnaut. It's already kicked off calls that Carr be expelled from the Labor Party for theirs "disloyalty".
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The fourth nor'easter in three weeks is set to smack the East Coast on the first day of spring.
The bulk of the dangerous, wind-driven snow and sleet is expected to wallop New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and parts of eastern Pennsylvania before heading off to Nantucket early Thursday, the National Weather Service said.
Sleet and freezing rain are expected Tuesday afternoon, the first day of spring. On Wednesday, about 6 to 9 inches of snow is expected, with some areas getting nearly a foot.
The jet stream, the upper level river of air that guides weather, is stuck in a plunging pattern that brings plenty of moisture from the south up the East Coast, said Brian Hurley, senior forecaster at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.
Four nor'easters in three weeks is highly unusual, but it happens when a pattern locks in. And that's happened, Hurley said.
Officials are cautioning against unnecessary travel Wednesday afternoon and evening, when snow could be falling as much as 3 inches an hour.
Widespread power outages are possible, especially Wednesday, with gusts of up to 35 mph at times.
"Upper level patterns like this tend to repeat and you tend to get these serial storms, one after the other," weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue said, adding that Europe will get the same drumbeat of storms a few days later.
But "the calendar is catching up to spring," Maue said. "Thankfully, you're going to see some spring pretty soon."

Igbo, Arewa Threats: Senate Direct FG To Uphold, Hand Jonathan's Confab Report To NASS
BY SOLOMON AYADO and AHURAKA ISAH, Abuja
….Senators To begin constituencies' sensitization campaigns on Peace
The Senate Wednesday directed the Federal Government to urgently adopt and sent to the National Assembly the report of the 2014 National Conference organized by the former President Goodluck Jonathan administration.
The directive of the Senate is coming as a necessary measure to evolve solutions to tackle the rising and escalating ethnic agitations in some parts of the country which is threatening the peace and unity of the nation.
The lawmakers said the greatest challenge facing Nigeria is the threat to national unity, as centrifugal forces, irredentists movement, call for self-determination, ethnicity and religious intolerance have enveloped to national consciousness.
By this, the Senate resolved that Distinguished Senators should quickly intensify their representative role and embark on sensitization campaign in their various constituencies to highlight the importance of harmonious and peaceful coexistence among Nigerians.
LEADERSHIP recalls that Jonathan had set up a confab committee to discuss issues that concerns Nigeria with the purpose of finding lasting solutions to them and to maintain the country's indivisibility. The report was forwarded on Wednesday, May 27, 2014 for consideration and necessary legislative actions by the Senate, but it was stepped down.
Yesterday, the Senate Leader, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan (Yobe North) moved a motion on the urgent need to proffer lasting solutions to ensure unity and harmony in the country and was well supported by all the lawmakers.
Tagged ” The Need for National Unity and Peaceful Coexistence in Nigeria” the motion seek to convey commitment of all Nigerians to live together in unity and harmony as one indivisible and indissoluble sovereign nation.
Leading the debate, Lawan noted that “since Independence, national integration has been the priority of government in Nigeria which saw the establishment of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), the Unity School System, the Federal Character Principles and many other affirmative policies intended to achieve national integration and peaceful coexistence.”
Lawan stated that some citizens rather than work for integration into a cohesive nation with a common sense of national identity, are busy preaching and primordial affiliation, and clamouring for ethically based and regionally supported threat to one united Nigeria in various parts of the country.
“The amalgamation of the Southern and Northern Protectorates in 1914 was not a mistake, but a design by the Almighty God as a nation of brothers and sisters united in common destiny,” they stated.
Senator Barnabas Gemade (Benue North East) said to properly address the challenges facing national unity, there must be upholding of fairness, justice and the rule of law even to eschew unequal treatment of ethnic nationalities.
Senator Adamu Aliero (Kebbi Central) said the motion was necessary to impacting the needed unity in the country, explaining that recommendations of the National confab of 2014 had suggestively discussed most of the national challenges enhancing disunity of Nigeria and urged it should be adopted.
Senator Shehu Sani (Kaduna Central) said peace is a major hold of a nation and that politicians must unambiguously refrain from sitting on the fence but to seriously evolve a frame work on reconstruction of the country.
“Politicians from the all the geopolitical zones must have the courage and must unequivocally, unreservedly and unambiguously, not be sitting on the fence or playing the ostrich in crisis like this and only when this is not done would a peaceful solution be found. We must look at the possible ways of reconstructing our country and a framework must be established,” Sani stated.
The minority leader, Godswil Akpabio (Akwa Ibom North West) noted that ethic agitations often spark due to anger and feelings of marginalization hence it is not properly addressed at the Federal Character. They said nationalities must shun the negative attitude of pressing down other ethnic groups whenever they take over leadership of the nation.
Senator Jonah Jang in their contribution said the major problem of Nigeria is leadership and that the recent agitations from the youths arose simply because the youngsters are not sure of their future and called for tackling of education and unemployment challenges.
After the deliberations, Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu applauded the effort of the lawmakers for charting a way forward for peace and unity to thrive, said it is a development that would further impact confidence of the LED in the leadership of the nation.

WENGEN, Switzerland (AP) — A warm aroma of melting wax curled out of the room where an unsung artisan of Alpine skiing was at work.
The trail led from a brightly lit basement, directly below a restaurant in a three-star hotel. It was a games room for most of the winter season in the Swiss Alps resort of Wengen, but pingpong tables were folded away during World Cup race week in January.
The space was needed for teams of technicians that spend hours hunched over workbenches, waxing the bases and sharpening the edges of skis to make a downhill racer like Lindsey Vonn that much faster.
Their work is crucial to any racer's success at the Pyeongchang Olympics, which open next week. It started long before the games, during preseason equipment tests, through offseason training, and on race days.
Working mostly out of public view, often in hotel cellars, the so-called servicemen are little-known even to ski fans.
Leo Mussi was in Wengen trying to create speed in the skis of two American downhillers for one of the season's classic races.
"We are really a little strange, I would say, too, us service guys," Mussi, one of skiing's most respected techs, told The Associated Press. "It's a tough job, physically, mentally. You travel a lot, you are on the road. But it's a kind of drug, too, this job."
Top-ranked racers are matched with technicians by their ski sponsor. Lower-ranked racers and newcomers typically have their skis prepared by a serviceman with the national team.
At the very top, some can request the best techs in a limited free-agent market. When Bode Miller split with renowned serviceman Heinz Haemmerle in 2009, Vonn was quick to pounce.
"They call them 'Magic Heinzi' for a reason," Vonn told the AP. "He has been doing this for almost as long as I have been alive.  They are amazing and I trust them completely."
That faith helps bind a skier's courage and racing instinct to hit speeds of up 145 kph (90 mph) on the mountain.
Mussi has dedicated almost 30 working years to two downhill racers — their fellow Italian Kristian Ghedina, and now American Steven Nyman — while employed by ski manufacturer Fischer.
"Leo is basically like a European father figure to me," Nyman said. "I don't even question him. I put the skis on and see they are going to be fast."
Vonn's ski tuner, Haemmerle, has long worked for the Head brand used by the men's downhill favorites, Beat Feuz of Switzerland and Norwegians Aksel Lund Svindal and Kjetil Jansrud. Friendship trumps rivalry in the Norway team and they share skis and a technician, Stefan Berthold.
Pairing skier with serviceman is the job of Rainer Salzgeber, Head's race director and a two-time Olympian for Austria.
"Some are really good buddies," Salzgeber said. "But not every athlete wants to have a really close friend who is working on their material."
In the full year of this Olympic season, they estimated, a skier and serviceman are away together for 200 days. That can mean equipment tests in the European spring, offseason training in South America, World Cup races in Europe and North America, the Winter Games in Asia, then back to Europe for season-ending races.
The special relationship is compared to that of a golfer and caddie. Except many caddies get days in the sun on television next to their golfer, plus 10 percent of prize money that routinely runs six figures.
The richest World Cup races — a men's downhill at Kitzbuehel, a women's slalom in Flachau, both in Austria — pay a first prize of less than $85,000. Not all skiers follow Nyman's example in giving 10 percent to their serviceman.
"It's a tough job," Salzgeber said. "The only payback that you have is success, actually."
Mussi has been part of 15 World Cup downhill wins, but also the kind of injuries that struck Nyman last week. Their Olympic season was ended by a torn ACL in their right knee.
"You need to know you are not always on the top," said Mussi, who also tunes skis for U.S. downhill prospect Bryce Bennett.
The camaraderie in hotel cellars helps. Mussi spoke at their workbench at the hub of a room for teams from Japan, South Korea, Slovakia and Poland.
A radio played classic rock and pop songs. Cans of beer were offered as the late afternoon work wound down, and a bottle of lotion was shared for inevitable hand injuries.
The tools of Mussi's trade have improved since they simply taped their fingers before filing steel ski edges. Now, a metal guiding tool does more precise work, and wax-shining brushes can be attached to a hand drill.
It still needs a simple plastic scraper to remove layers of old wax — key to reducing friction between ski and snow — and Mussi uses a diamond file to finesse the edges just before a race.
Then, in the start house, as racers like Nyman peer down the mountain for a final few seconds, a ski tech can also be coach and motivator.
"You are a highly respected person," Mussi said. "(The racers) know what they have."

ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — DarkMatter, a growing cybersecurity company in the United Arab Emirates that's recruited Western intelligence analysts, is stepping out of the shadows amid concerns by activists about its power and potential targets.
The company's founder and CEO, Faisal al-Bannai, says DarkMatter takes part in no hacking, although they acknowledge the firm's close business ties to the Emirati government, as well as its hiring of former CIA and National Security Agency analysts.
Activists warn such expertise could be used to target human rights campaigners, some of whom already have been jailed in the UAE, a major U.S. ally in the Mideast.
Al-Bannai told The Associated Press their company carefully chooses its clients, while leaving the ethical decisions about privacy and surveillance in wielding its powerful technology to its governmental customers, which include the Dubai police.
"Ignoring that use, in my view, would be silly," they said. "I think tackling that issue and saying, 'What is the right balance,' is the right question and the one I think everyone is trying to figure out."
Surveillance is prolific across the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. Flashing cameras capture license plates of vehicles pulling into gas stations. At Dubai's Mall of the Emirates, home to an indoor ski slope, shoppers can use a kiosk to find their cars via the mall's surveillance system.
Authorities say surveillance keeps the UAE safe. Surveillance footage helped authorities quickly identify the woman who stabbed an American school teacher to death at an Abu Dhabi mall in 2014.
It also aided Dubai police in identifying members of what it described as an Israeli hit squad that killed an operative with the Palestinian militant Hamas group in 2010, an attack never acknowledged by Israel.
For al-Bannai, whose father is a retired major general with the Dubai police, cybersecurity seemed like a good bet after they found success with their mobile phone reselling firm Axiom Telecom. They formed DarkMatter in 2015 and today, they said the company has some 650 employees. Most work out of its headquarters in the disc-shaped Aldar building along a major highway connecting Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The firm also has research-and-development centers in China, Finland and Toronto, they said.
"The only country in the region that's strong in cybersecurity is Israel," al-Bannai told foreign journalists who visited DarkMatter on Tuesday. "Other than that, it's blank."
They described DarkMatter as entirely privately held, with a customer base that is 80 percent government agencies and 20 percent commercial. They declined to name specific clients, but many suspects they include the Signals Intelligence Agency, the Emirati version of the NSA. The agency is also registered as having offices in the Aldar building.
"Frankly, it's an alignment of the stars," al-Bannai said of DarkMatter's government contracts. "It is a pure commercial transaction with them."
Since its inception, rumors have swirled around DarkMatter.
Some hackers described receiving aggressive, repeated job offers by the firm. An Italian hacker wrote a blog post in 2016 alleging that DarkMatter tried to hire them through a third-party recruiter who described the company as setting up a vast domestic spying infrastructure, something denied by al-Bannai.
However, human rights activists and others have been targeted by hacks suspected to be directed, if not carried out, by the Emirati government.
Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor became famous in August 2016 when they worked with security experts to reveal three previously undisclosed weaknesses in Apple's mobile operating system after they were allegedly targeted with a phishing text message they didn't open.
Mansoor and others believed the United Arab Emirates was behind the attack, as it involved so-called "zero day" exploits — flaws in programming that hackers can use to potentially install spyware or gain control of a system — that can be worth over a million dollars each. Mansoor was arrested by UAE authorities last March for their online posts. Authorities later said they were being held at Abu Dhabi's central prison and had "the freedom to hire a lawyer" and receive family visits.
Another hacking campaign targeting Mansoor and others, dubbed "Stealth Falcon," also appeared to be coordinated by the government, said Bill Marczak, a research fellow at Citizen Lab. DarkMatter's close work with the Emirati government, and the experience of its staff, raised flags about the company, Marczak said.
"When you're talking about human rights activists like Ahmed Mansoor ... there's nothing they can do and the government gets access to them and their contacts and then can take further actions against their contacts," they said. "It's one thing to use them against people you may think are committing terrorist acts or criminal acts, but using them against someone who is just kind of sitting around their living room tweeting, it seems kind of disproportionate."
Al-Bannai said DarkMatter had no depository of "zero day" exploits, nor did it take part in so-called "offensive hacking." They pointed to one of the company's signature products, a secure mobile phone called "Katim," or "silence" in Arabic, as showing the firm's interest in defensive technology.
They added that DarkMatter hired CIA, NSA and other ex-government employees for their experience.
"If you think an NSA guy is a spooky guy, the NSA guy is the one protecting you in the U.S.," al-Bannai said. "These are not the bad guys."
They did, however, acknowledge that questions remain about how much information authorities should have and be able to use.
Pegasus, a DarkMatter subsidiary, now has a "big data" contract with Dubai police. An example offered by al-Bannai suggested police could be able to pool hours of surveillance video to track anyone in the emirate.
"My team knows what they're building," they said. "If they thought they were building funny stuff, they wouldn't be here."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration let a top Russian spy official visit the United States last week for meetings with U.S. intelligence officials even though there are sanctions against them that typically prohibit such visits, officials said Tuesday.
The Russian ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, said on Russian state TV that Sergei Naryshkin, head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, met with their U.S. counterparts about the fight against terrorism.
The visit came less than a week before President Donald Trump decided not to issue any new sanctions against Russian politicians and oligarchs over Russian meddling in the U.S. election.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a frequent critic of Trump's treatment of Russian President Vladimir Putin and their government, said the timing of the trip was suspicious.
"This is a serious national security issue," Schumer told reporters. "Russia hacked our elections. We sanctioned the head of their foreign intelligence, and then the Trump administration invites them to waltz through our front door. This is an extreme dereliction of duty by President Trump, who seems more intent on undermining the rule of law in this country than standing up to Putin."
Schumer wants to know whether sanctions were discussed, whether Naryshkin also met with White House or national security officials and whether other sanctioned Russian officials were along on the trip. Naryshkin was sanctioned in 2014 in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea.
The CIA released a statement saying that while it does not discuss the schedules of U.S. intelligence leaders, "rest assured that any interaction with foreign intelligence agencies would have been conducted in accordance with U.S. law and in consultation with appropriate departments and agencies."
Jonathan Schanzer, a sanctions expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that typically, people who have been sanctioned have their assets frozen and are barred from entering the United States. They said there are cases where individuals from sanctioned countries enter the United States after getting permission to attend meetings at the United Nations.
Situations like Naryshkin's visit are more unusual, Schanzer said.
"We don't see this sort of thing being reported very often," they said.

The industrial world noticed last week when ABB Ltd. announced its $2.6 billion purchase of General Electric Co.'s Industrial Solutions business. The decision to sell confirmed that GE will change under new CEO John Flannery. The decision to buy cemented ABB as a major player in the North American industry.
CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer described the unit as an “unloved child” and said, “We know what needs to be fixed. We are very confident this business will prosper as part of ABB.” If they do, the bottom line will benefit: ABB will incur costs of about $400 million over five years to integrate the business, but it could eventually generate annual cost savings of about $200 million.
The deal could also spark ABB in its chase of global electrification leader Schneider Electric. Nobody in the company has publicly stated that as a goal right now — better now, bigger later, they say — but wait three or four years and the results might speak for themselves.
IndustryWeek talked with Tarak Mehta, president of the Electrification Products division of ABB and a member of the group executive committee, not long after the deal entered the news. They shared some information about the process, the future and where other industrial companies might glean some best practices.
IndustryWeek: Congratulations on this deal. In this euphoric aftermath, what is the biggest takeaway for you?
Tarak Mehta: I think the real takeaway is the commitment of ABB to the North American market, and also to this segment of the portfolio of ABB. We've now made significant investments to this part of the portfolio — you remember (the 2012 acquisition of) Thomas & Betts, which was also a ($3.9) billion dollar investment — and with GE Industrial Solutions, we're building on that investment. The focus is, this is a core part of ABB. The board and the team feel this is where we want to invest. … And for the North American market, we are now a Tier 1 supplier and partner for the distribution channel in the United States and Canada. That's the highlight of why we're doing this.
IW: And what is the long-term goal with this move?
TM: It's not only a North American move. It's a complement to the portfolio. The fact we can create to the scale that we have, we can unlock significant potential in this business, that's how we see it, and on top of all that, we believe we can strengthen GE's Industrial Solutions business through the complementary technology we have.
IW: If we look at the profit margins of GE Industrial Solutions, they're a little lower than what you're used to, right around 8% last year. You said in another interview you thought they could maybe double to 15%, 20% within the next three years.
TM: If you ask, ‘How are we going to do this?' this process will take a significant amount of time. It won't happen overnight. We have to address the product portfolio and the technology harmonization, and that takes time. There is an optimization on the supply side of how we serve the market. We say it will take us up to five years to get this business to appear at the profitability level, not three years. We want to do it right. We have a full understanding of the challenges and how much effort it takes to get this kind of performance up. In our industry, which is fairly conservative, it's going to take time from a product lifecycle replacement to incorporate new solutions we'll bring to the market.
We also are planning to invest quite a bit into the business, to make it better first, then bigger. It's going to take time and significant investment.
IW: What advice, what best practices can you pass along, now having gone through this process over the better part of the last year?
TM: Looking at our integration, the way we characterize this addition to the family is integrating a known core business into a No. 2 player. It's a powerful combination of complementary businesses that will shape the global leadership in electrification with a comprehensive U.S. portfolio. … A key part is to retain the management, in engineering and in sales. The proximity, the relationships with the customers, the trusted brand are all key parts of the value proposition. Business is all about people, and any deal we've been part of, retaining the key people, making sure that are part of the future is a key component to success. And, of course, when you acquire a brand as strong as GE, we need to do a good job to make sure the deep customer relationships are maintained and become stronger.
From a philosophical level, you have to walk in saying, ‘Look, neither of the two organizations is best. Let's have an objective process of evaluation of what we like about the GE Industrial Solutions business and what they like about the ABB electrification products, and let's take the best of both worlds.' If you do that, you have commitment and joint energy. In this case, these are the success criteria: a clear view of what we're doing, a clear objective of what we want to get to — whether that's numbers, performance, people — and how we are going to work together. These are the three foundational elements.
IW: You mentioned that keeping people and maintaining continuity was an important part of all this. In a business that is, as you said, rather conservative, I imagine that was a key requirement as you were going through the last year, making sure everybody stayed on after the acquisition.
TM: When we looked at the people as part of the due diligence, we spent quite a bit of time, we visited almost every location to understand what the business has. In the process, we met many of the people and we came away with a clear understanding of where the challenges are in the business and the strengths of this business are. … It's really in product and technology where we can support it.
Our perspective is that this is a business that has been underinvested in for a long time. The people and the teams that have run it have done a bang-up job to keep it at its level of performance. When we give it support, investment, technology, encouragement, this business will turn around.
IW: The GE brand still has a certain power. Being associated with them, having them under the ABB umbrella, has to be a great feeling, and a pretty great get, as well.
TM: There are quite a few value drivers in this relationship. One is their willingness to allow us to use a valuable brand, continue to support, to develop this transition to ABB over a sustained period of time. The second is the supplier relationship. We'll have a preferred supplier relationship with GE to supply — and not only Industrial Solutions, but also the greater ABB portfolio. GE has been quite gracious and willing to put ABB in a preferred supplier construct and relationship. … Those are other elements of the value beyond product portfolio and people.
IW: As you continue to chase down Schneider Electric for that top spot — and maybe this will be the move that pushes you there — do you think there will be more acquisitions to come? ABB has spent about $11 billion on acquisitions over the last decade already, which is rather aggressive.
TM: We want to first close this deal, and we're not there yet. Our goal for the next few years is to make this business stronger first. We haven't factored significant revenue growth for the first few years because we need to get better first, stronger, and then the goal is to get better. We are still some distance away from Schneider, so our goal very much on the customer side, innovation side, technology side — not necessarily to be No. 1 purely from a revenue point of view, but really in performance to shareholders and customers. That's our main goal.
In that process, if we get to No. 1, that'd be great. But this solidifies our No. 2 position. In five years, you may very well be right, but at this point, given this big move, we need to deliver on this before we look for anything else sizeable.
IW: This deal is expected to be finished some time in the second half of next year. You're looking at three or four quarters to get this finalized?
TM: If you could estimate when the regulatory process would conclude, you could have a very profitable consulting organization. Unfortunately, it will take the time that the regulatory authorities want. We don't expect it (to drag), but it's really difficult to estimate exactly when it will wrap up. That depends on the regulatory authorities.
To make the wall -- and keep it inexpensive and simple to construct -- the researchers tested various conductive paints, the best way to apply them, whether a topcoat was beneficial or a hindrance, how to connect the wall electrodes, the best electrode pattern and how to optimize antenna sensitivity. Following these experiments, the team chose to use water-based nickel paint applied to the wall in a diamond pattern with a roller. They used copper tape to connect the electrodes, vinyl stickers as insulation and latex paint as a topcoat.
Once the wall was constructed, it was able to detect touch and hovering, estimate the pose of a person standing near it, determine when appliances were running and, in general, where. When they were wearing wristbands that emitted a constant 1.5 MHz signal, the wall was also able to generally track individuals. You can see the wall in action in the video below.
It's an interesting concept and it could allow walls to take on some useful features. The researchers describe how Wall++ could function has a control panel, allowing users to touch it to turn lights on and off, unlock a door or control music. And it could offer slider-like input, giving more nuanced control over lighting levels, temperature and music volume. The pose tracking feature could be used in conjunction with video games and the appliance activity recognition could, for example, allow for automatic adjustments of lighting and window blind position when a TV is turned on.
The work is just a proof-of-concept study and there's more research to be done in order to optimize it. But it's a rather simple and relatively low cost setup (as is, it cost just over $21 per square meter) that could introduce some function to our walls.
EDMONTON — Parks Canada is preparing for an increase in visitors this year as people across the country and around the world request free annual passes to explore the nation's natural treasures as part of Canada's 150th anniversary celebration.
Conservationists say it is important for people to connect with nature, but there are concerns about how more tourists may affect the ecological integrity of some of the more popular parks.
Ben Gadd, a retired nature guide and author of “Handbook of the Canadian Rockies,” said they are worried about increased vehicle traffic.
“Clearly the highway system in the mountain parks — it is going to be terrible next summer all summer long,” said Gadd, who has been hiking in the region since 1968.
“When you have that situation and animals trying to cross there are going to be more accidents, more animals killed.”
Gadd said they are also concerned about crowded attractions, trash and people feeding or getting too close to wildlife.
They hope there are enough staff to properly maintain the parks and to explain the rules to visitors, especially newbies.
According to Parks Canada, more than 900,000 people ordered a free Discovery Pass in the first two weeks after they became available last month.
The government predicts visits to national parks, historic sites and marine conservation areas will top last year's attendance of about 24.5 million.
Eric Hebert-Daly, national executive director of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, said the Parks Canada plan is a good idea in principle, but there are some dangers.
Some parks such as Banff, Jasper and the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario are already very busy. Adding more people could take away from their grandeur, they said.
Hebert-Daly said the government should consider better ways to handle traffic in busy parks, including the increased use of shuttle buses.
There are also not enough wardens and scientists to monitor the health of the parks, they said.
“This may be the year where we realize just how overstretched some of these places are,” Hebert-Daly said.
Canada's national parks have a long history of attracting tourists eager to view wildlife and wilderness. Increased media attention is expected to draw even more visitors.
National Geographic Traveler magazine has put the Banff area on its “Best of the World” list of 21 must-see places in 2017 and Parks Canada has been busy promoting on social media as part of the Canada 150 campaign.
On Dec. 1 so many people jumped online to get a free annual pass that the department's computer system slowed to a crawl.
Ed Jager with Parks Canada said staff know they are in for a busy year.
The number of cleaning and maintenance crews has been increased to ensure facilities will be kept in shape and that garbage doesn't attract wildlife, they said.
Jager said online orders for annual passes are being tracked to get a sense of which parks will see more traffic. Information about park rules is being sent to visitors.
Parks Canada is also trying to take some heat off of more popular parks by promoting other, less-visited destinations.
The department has released a list of “ten hidden gems” across Canada for people to explore including the Mingan Archipelago National Park reserve in Quebec, L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Site in Newfoundland and Labrador and Grasslands National Park in Saskatchewan.
“We can't actually love our parks to death — I think the death of our parks is when nobody wants to come to them and when they don't care about them anymore,” they said.
“We would much rather be in this place then in a place where nobody is showing up.”
Parks Canada plans to open its online reservation system (www.pc.gc.ca/eng/voyage-travel/reserve.aspx) for campsites starting with some parks in British Columbia on Jan. 3 and adding more parks across the country throughout the month.
While annual park passes are free in 2017, there are still fees for campsites, firewood and backcountry passes.
A close aide to John Bercow – who the Speaker once called their “stalwart” – can be revealed as a Labour supporter who has sent a string of abusive anti-Tory tweets. Tom Tweddle has worked as Bercow's assistant since 2011, before which they were a researcher for former Labour minister Quentin Davies. Their Gareth Snell-style Tory-bashing is apparent from a brief glance at their Twitter account:
All these comments were made during Tweddle's employment with the Speaker, while they were supposedly helping them in their non-partisan role. Unfortunate timing as Bercow faces questions about their impartiality…
We reported last week that the developers of the Parrot Security OS ethical hacking and penetration testing GNU/Linux distribution are evaluating a possible migration of their operating system from Debian GNU/Linux to Devuan GNU/Linux.
As you are aware, Devuan GNU/Linux is a fork of Debian GNU/Linux, but without using systemd as the default init system. Many popular Linux-based operating system adopted systemd since its initial launch seven years ago, but it looks like there are others out there that still hate the init system and what it becomes.
When we wrote our story about Parrot Security OS considering ditching its Debian base for Devuan's, there wasn't any official announcement or anything like that, but only a simple tweet. Now, the developers of the penetration testing distro have published a more in-depth story where they mostly mock systemd, with memes.
"We just consider systemd an immature init system which works almost perfectly on some standard desktop use cases. But we also believe that your approach is destroying that part of the Unix philosophy that made GNU/Linux one of the most stable and reliable systems out there," said the Parrot Security OS developers.
Parrot Security OS are currently testing their packages on top of Devuan
In other words, the Parrot Security OS devs share they thoughts on systemd, which is the main reason for the move to Devuan from Debian. But, for now, they are just testing how their packages would behave on top of Devuan GNU/Linux and what they need to modify to have everything working without systemd.
If you're asking yourselves "is Parrot switching to Devuan?" the official answer right now is that it's not switching just yet. Even if they hate systemd so much, the Parrot Security OS development team need to do a lot of testing to ensure their penetration testing operating system works correctly before the migration. We'll keep you guys updated with progress.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — An Illinois man known for honoring the victims of mass shootings around the country installed 58 white crosses on the Las Vegas Strip on Thursday.
Greg Zanis drove nearly 2,000 miles from the Chicago area to install the crosses on a patch of grass near the iconic “Welcome to Las Vegas” sign, not far from the site of the Route 91 Harvest country music festival where 58 people were killed on Sunday night.
Zanis, a 66-year-old retired carpenter, made their first cross 20 years ago when their father-in-law was killed.
“That just changed my life,” Zanis said. “My first cross was for somebody that I loved. And when I put up these crosses here, I always think of my personal loss here too. Always.”
Zanis has become well-known for erecting more than 20,000 of the markers over the past two decades, including after the Columbine and Sandy Hook school shootings and the massacre at an Orlando nightclub.
The crosses, which Zanis said took them two days to cut and paint, feature a red heart.
They plan to keep the tribute up for 40 days before giving the crosses to the families of the victims.
Rep. Jason Saine named to FCC committee
MATT CHAPMAN
Staff Writer
Lincoln County state Rep. Jason Saine has been appointed to the Federal Communications Commission's Intergovernmental Advisory Committee.
The IAC will operate for a two-year term, which will commence with the committee's first meeting in Washington, D.C. at FCC headquarters on a date to be announced. The FCC will have the option to reauthorize the IAC at the end of the two-year period.
The committee will be tasked with providing expertise and recommendations to the FCC on a variety of telecommunication issues, focusing on broadband and wireless infrastructure deployment, Universal Service programs, consumer complaints processes and public safety issues.
“The IAC serves as an advisory board to the FCC to relay some of the challenges that state and local governments face with broadband deployment,” Saine said. “It provides a nice platform to interact with federal decision-makers on some of the policies that they're setting forth and how they work and how they don't work. Sometimes regulations are passed that they believe are helpful, but in reality they may be hurtful. This will allow me to work with federal regulators and keep them aware of the challenges facing Lincoln County and how to best address those issues.”
There are currently good broadband options in Lincoln County, according to Saine, but some of the more rural areas of the county are lacking in that department. These remote locations simply lack the number of households necessary to provide the same services available in Lincolnton and Denver.
Saine plans to introduce a bill when the North Carolina General Assembly returns to session that will help facilitate the deployment of broadband in these rural areas. They described these proposed small cell broadband capabilities, where telephone poles are used to create wi-fi networks that will allow carriers to deliver high-speed broadband via wireless signals, as the “wave of the future.”
“It will be very interesting to serve on this board with a new administration that is very pro-business and wants to innovate,” Saine said. “What we really want to do is get government regulation out of the way so that you can see private enterprise expand broadband options … I hear from leaders across the state from municipalities and counties who want more high-speed broadband because they feel as though it would help their economic development and recruitment. My main focus on this advisory board is to make sure that the federal government understands that when they put barriers in place it puts smaller cities and counties at a competitive disadvantage.”
Saine previously operated a small tech company in downtown Lincolnton that worked on servers and desktops, helping to integrate small businesses that were just beginning to adopt the internet as part of their practices. Saine was recognized for their work in IT with the North Carolina Technology Association Public Leadership award.

A bid to ban abortions after 15 weeks has become law in Louisiana.
A spokesperson for Gov. John Bel Edwards says Wednesday that the Democrat has signed the proposal , which would only take effect if a federal court upholds a similar law in Mississippi.
The measure imposes a prison sentence of up to two years for someone who performs the procedure after 15 weeks.
Democratic Sen. John Milkovich, who sponsored the bill, says the state is moving to protect the unborn.
Reproductive health advocates have opposed the bill.
Mississippi enacted a 15-week abortion ban in March. It was immediately challenged and a federal judge put it on hold. That state now faces what's expected to be a long legal battle.

BEIJING (AP) — In a story Jan. 28 about Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai, who was taken away by people who appeared to be Chinese police while traveling to Beijing by in the company of Swedish diplomats, the headline erroneously referred to Gui as a Chinese citizen. Gui is a naturalized Swedish citizen.
A corrected version of the story is below.
US calls for release of missing Swedish bookseller
BEIJING (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration has joined European governments in urging China to release a Swedish citizen who sold gossipy books about Chinese leaders.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson called on China to disclose Gui Minhai's location and allow them to leave China if they wish.
"We call on Chinese authorities to explain the reasons and legal basis for Mr. Gui's arrest and detention, disclose their whereabouts, and allow them freedom of movement and the freedom to leave China," spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement.
The U.S. "will continue to coordinate with our partners, allies and regional organizations on promoting greater respect for human rights in China," Nauert said.
Around 10 Chinese police officers surrounded Gui and Swedish diplomats on Jan. 20 as they traveled by train to Beijing. Gui, a naturalized Swedish citizen, was seized and their whereabouts remain unknown.
Gui had disappeared from their home in Thailand in 2015 and reappeared months later in China after being sentenced for a decade-old traffic violation.
In a videotaped confession that supporters believe was coerced, Gui stated that they had turned themselves in to mainland authorities over a hit-and-run accident.
That spurred suspicions that they had been abducted by the Chinese security services. They remained closely supervised even after their release from prison.
Their latest detention has particularly rattled Western governments after it unfolded in the presence of diplomats.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry says it has no information about Gui's whereabouts, but has suggested that they may have been breaking the terms of their release. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.
Gui was one of five Hong Kong booksellers whose disappearances symbolized China's determination to enforce its hard line on squelching political dissent and a free press __ despite international criticism.
They were released into house arrest in October in the eastern city of Ningbo, living in what their daughter Angela called a police-managed apartment.
Under Chinese law, those convicted of a crime generally have their civil rights suspended for a period of time, although it wasn't clear whether that applied in Gui's case. The prohibitions, which are often not made public, can also include restrictions on travel.
The office of EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has said it "fully supports the public statement and efforts of the Swedish government" on Gui's behalf.

Gambia authorities shut independent radio station
Popular independent Gambian radio station Teranga FM was Sunday ordered to cease operations by national security agents for unspecified reasons, a security source and staff member said.
The station, which translates news from Gambian papers into local languages, has previously been silenced and in 2015 its manager was slapped with sedition and “publication of false news” charges for privately sharing a provocative photo of President Yahya Jammeh.
“Four National Intelligence Agency operatives and one police officer in uniform came to the radio station this afternoon (Sunday) around 2:30 pm and told us to stop broadcasting,” a staff member told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“They said they have been ordered by the director general of NIA, Yankuba Badjie, to tell us to stop broadcasting with immediate effect. We asked them the reason for their action, but they said they are only acting on executive orders and do not know the reason why the radio should stop broadcasting,” they added.
A security source said no one had been arrested but could not say why the radio station was ordered off the air.
“We only asked them to stop broadcasting and they cooperated with us. They have stopped broadcasting since in the afternoon,” the source told AFP.
The radio station was not broadcasting Sunday evening, according to an AFP correspondent.
Station manager Alagie Ceesay was arrested by the country's secret police in July 2015 on charges of sedition and “publication of false news” relating to allegations that they distributed images by mobile phone of a gun pointed at a picture of Jammeh.
Ceesay escaped from hospital where they were being treated in mid-April last year while on trial for sedition.
Jammeh, who has ruled the small west African country with an iron fist since taking power in a bloodless coup in 1994, lost December's presidential election but has rejected the results and filed a court challenge.
 They are regularly accused of rights abuses and repression of the media.
The Gambia ranked 145 out of 180 countries in Reporters Without Borders' 2016 World Press Freedom Index, pointing to “a climate of terror around anything remotely to do with journalism”.

In 1671, Giovanni Domenico Cassini, an Italian-French astronomer, discovered Iapetus, Saturn's third largest moon. Even back then, Cassini knew there was something odd about this moon, because they only saw it on the west side of Saturn, never the east. They deduced, correctly, that one side of Iapetus is bright and the other dark and because the moon's rotation is locked such that the same side is always facing Saturn, Iapetus' bright side faces Earth only when it is to the east of Saturn. Spacecraft have since gotten a much clearer look at Iapetus' two-tone surface, including this photograph by Cassini's namesake, NASA's Cassini probe last year.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal health officials are cracking down on underage use of a popular e-cigarette brand following months of complaints from parents, politicians and school administrators.
The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has issued warnings to 40 retail and online stores as part of a nationwide operation against illegal sales of Juul to children.
FDA regulators also are asking manufacturer Juul Labs to turn over documents about the design, marketing and ingredients of its devices. The rare request particularly focuses on whether certain product features are directly appealing to young people.
Like other e-cigarettes, Juul is an electronic device that turns liquid - usually containing nicotine - into an inhalable vapor. Thanks in part to its resemblance to a small computer flash drive, Juul has become popular with some teenagers as a discreet way to vape at school and in public.
Health advocates have worried about the popularity of vaping products among kids and the potential impact on adult smoking rates in the future. A recent government-commissioned report found "substantial evidence" that young people who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try cigarettes.
FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency plans additional actions in coming weeks.
"This isn't the only product that we're looking at, and this isn't the only action we're going to be taking to target youth access to tobacco products, and e-cigarettes, in particular," Gottlieb said in an interview.
Juul sales have exploded over the past two years and the brand now accounts for 55 percent of the U.S. market for e-cigarettes, according to industry figures. That's up from just 5 percent of the market in 2016.
The San Francisco-based company said in a statement it agrees with the FDA that underage of its products is "unacceptable."
"We already have in place programs to identify and act upon these violations at retail and online marketplaces, and we will have more aggressive plans to announce in the coming days," the statement read.
Juul Labs says it monitors retailers to ensure they are following the law. Its age verification system searches public records and sometimes requires customers to upload a photo ID.
E-cigarettes have grown into a $4 billion industry in the U.S. despite little research on their long-term effects, including whether they are helpful in helping smokers quit cigarettes.
That's the sales pitch made by Juul and many other e-cigarette manufacturers: "Juul delivers nicotine satisfaction akin to a cigarette in a format that's as simple and easy to use," states the company's website. A Juul "starter kit" can be ordered online for $49.99. The company's website is intended to only sell to customers ages 21 and up.
The FDA gained authority to regulate e-cigarettes in 2016, but anti-smoking advocates have criticized the agency for not policing the space more aggressively to stop companies from appealing to underage users, particularly with flavors like mango, cool cucumber and creme brulee.
"These are very positive steps and demonstrate that FDA recognizes the problem of youth use is very serious," said Matthew Myers, of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "But they don't address the biggest issue that the FDA is not enforcing its own rules."
Myers' group contends that Juul and several other e-cigarette companies have recently launched new flavors and varieties without seeking FDA authorization. That step is mandatory under the FDA regulations put in place summer of 2016.

Oregon Woman Says Airline Responsible For Dog's Death
By Cox Media Group National Content Desk
A Bend, Oregon, woman is blaming United Airlines after their golden retriever arrived sick and later died following a longer-than-planned trip from Michigan.
>> Read more trending news
Kathleen Considine had arranged for their mother to have 7-year-old Jacob flown to their new home in Oregon from Detroit, following a mandatory physical exam, on a United Airlines trip expected to take a total of 10 hours, according to Local 4 News in Detroit.
In a Facebook post, Considine explained that they had a giant crate for Jacob and that they were told it should fit in the cargo hold on both legs of the flight to Oregon. They later learned that there was a problem in Chicago:
"When Jacob landed in Chicago, it was found that the airline agent LIED and they did not fit on the plane to Portland. They were then sent to a kennel over night, 20 HOURS, until the next flight out they could fit on."
According to KGW, Jacob ended up spending 20 hours in a kennel without food. The airline also reportedly didn't allow Considine's mother to provide food because the original trip was expected to be relatively short.
Considine said in the post that Jacob arrived in Portland disoriented and non-responsive. After the three-hour drive to Central Oregon, they said that their condition worsened.
Jacob eventually was taken to an emergency vet, where they died after several minutes of CPR.
In lengthy Facebook post, Considine said that Jacob died because "his stomach flipped due to the stress of their journey that was 20 hours longer than expected, and suffocated their organs." They also expressed their feelings on how they the airline handled the incident as well as its "PetSafe" program.
Hi friends, I'm asking all DOG LOVER'S to please read and SHARE this post. The word needs to get out that airline travel... Posted by Kathleen Considine on Friday, February 10, 2017
Local 4 News in Detroit reached out to United Airlines and received the following statement:
"We were deeply saddened to hear of Jacob's passing after we returned them to the care of their owner. Our PetSafe team is committed to the safety and comfort of all the pets that travel with us. We worked to ensure Jacob's comfort throughout their entire journey and they showed no signs of distress nor behave in a way that would suggest they were unwell while in our care. Though we understand little can ease the grief that accompanies the loss of a pet, we've been in touch with Ms. Considine to offer our condolences and discuss this matter further."

Freeman quits Mayo panel 14 February 2017
Mayo's Alan Freeman
©INPHO Mayo's Alan Freeman©INPHO
Mayo forward Alan Freeman who currently lives and works in Dublin, has stepped away from the senior football panel due to work commitments.
Manager Stephen Rochford explained of the player's decision to leave the panel in an interview with 'The Mayo News'. “Due to work commitments, Alan can't commit right now to being part of the Mayo squad,” said Rochford.
Freeman who will most certainly be a loss has already featured at full forward for Mayo in their League opener against Monaghan which ended in defeat.
The door is not completely closed on a return as Rochford claimed "I've always said that the panel remains open-ended and who knows what might happen in the future.”
The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a car bomb that exploded on Monday in a bustling market area in Baghdad, killing 24 people and wounding 67.
The suicide bomber blew up their explosives-laden vehicle in a Shi'ite neighborhood, hours after the arrival of French President Francois Hollande to the country and amid a fierce fight against ISIS.
Amaq news agency, a site linked to the militants, said in a statement distributed online that the attack had targeted a gathering of Shi'ite Muslims, which the ultra-hardline Sunni group considers apostates.
The bomber, driving a pickup truck, attacked an outdoor fruit and vegetable market, daily laborers and a police checkpoint in Baghdad's eastern Sadr City district, a police officer said.
The Islamic State also claimed responsibility for Saturday's suicide attack in a central Baghdad market, which killed at least 28 people, and Sunday's suicide bombing at a checkpoint south of Baghdad that killed at least nine people.
Iraq witnesses near-daily attacks, including in Baghdad, which have been frequently claimed by ISIS. Late last month, Iraqi authorities started removing some of the security checkpoints in Baghdad, mainly on its eastern side, in a bid to ease traffic for the capital's approximately 6 million residents.
The attack came Hollande started an official visit to Iraq to meet officials and French troops. During their one-day visit, Hollande met with Iraqi President Fuad Masum and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in the capital, Baghdad. Later, he'll travel to the country's self-governing northern Kurdish region to meet French troops and local officials.

Iraqi troops, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, are fighting ISIS in a massive operation to retake the northern city of Mosul. Iraqi state TV said Holland will discuss "increasing support to Iraq and the latest developments in the fight against Daesh," the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.
In quotes published by the Elysee official Twitter account, Holland promised that France would remain a long-term ally of Iraq and called for coordination between intelligence services "in a spirit of great responsibility."
France is part of the U.S.-led international coalition formed in late 2014 to fight ISIS after the extremist group seized large areas in Iraq and neighboring Syria and declared an Islamic "caliphate." France has suffered multiple terrorist attacks claimed by ISIS.
Hollande, on Twitter, said Iraq was in a precarious position two years ago, when the Islamic State made its blitz. But now the tide has turned. "The results are there: Daesh is in retreat and the battle of Mosul is engaged."
Since the Mosul operation started on October 17, Iraqi forces have seized around a quarter of the city. Last week, the troops resumed fighting after a two-week lull due to stiff resistance by the militants, bad weather and thousands of civilians trapped in their houses.
In an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, the senior U.S. military commander, Brig. Gen. Rick Uribe, praised the Iraqi forces fighting mainly on the eastern side of the city, saying they were "at their peak." Uribe agreed with al-Abadi's assessment that it would take another three months to liberate Mosul.
They predicted the troops would face a different fight when they cross to the west bank of the Tigris River, saying it will mostly be a "dismounted" battle fought in part on narrow streets, some of which were not wide enough for a vehicle to pass.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city is located about 360 kilometers (225 miles) northwest of Baghdad. While the Syrian city of Raqqa is considered the caliphate's de facto capital, Mosul is the largest city under its control. It is the last major ISIS urban stronghold in Iraq.

Customs intercept contraband valued at N334m
Lagos – The Federal Operations Unit (FOU) of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Ikeja says it intercepted contraband with a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N334 million between April 1 and June 12.
The command said it also recovered N273.6 million from duty payments and demand notices on goods that tried to beat the system in the period under review.
The Controller of the unit, Mr Mohammed Garba, disclosed this at a news conference in Lagos on Wednesday.
Garba said that 10 suspects were arrested in connection with the seizures.
They said in the period under review, 152 different seizures were recorded comprising vegetable oil, foreign parboiled rice, frozen poultry products, smuggled vehicles, India hemp, used tyres and general merchandise.
“You will agree with me that smuggling is a global phenomenon which cannot be curbed entirely but can be brought to its barest minimum.
“I have to praise the commitment and diligence of the officers and men of the unit for thwarting the antics of some dare-devil smugglers, who used different methods for concealment.
“Recently, above all was the interception of 384 parcels of Indian hemp concealed inside six bales of second-hand clothing from Ghana along Iyana-Ipaja road.
“In the spirit of inter-agency relationship, the suspects and the contents will be handed over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for prosecution in a court of competent jurisdiction.
“Based on information and after physical examination, we have seized five containers that contravened Customs law over false declaration and breach of import prohibition list by trade,'' they said.
Garba said that two of the containers were laden with 4,982 pieces of used tyres, while others were laden with 1,292 pieces of vehicle batteries and piston ring compressors.
The controller thanked the management of the service under the leadership of Col. Hammed Ali for their efforts in recognising hard work and diligence.

By JEFF AMY and SARAH MEARHOFF
Associated Press
JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Mississippi moved quickly toward a legal confrontation over the nation's most restrictive abortion law Monday.
Within six hours, the governor signed a bill banning most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, the state's lone abortion clinic sued, and a federal judge set a Tuesday morning hearing to consider blocking the restrictions.
Abortion opponents sought the confrontation, hoping federal courts will ultimately prohibit abortions before a fetus is viable. Current federal law blocks such restrictions by states.
Some legal experts have said a change in the law is unlikely unless the makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court changes in a way that favors abortion opponents.
Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1510 in a closed ceremony attended by legislative supporters and abortion opponents.
"We are saving more of the unborn than any state in America, and what better thing can we do?" Bryant said in a video their office posted on social media.
Mississippi's only abortion clinic, though, is asking an immediate halt to the law, telling a federal judge that a woman who is 15 weeks or more pregnant is scheduled to have an abortion Tuesday afternoon. Late Monday, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves set a Tuesday morning hearing on the request by the Jackson Women's Health Organization that they impose a temporary restraining order.
The law's only exceptions are if a fetus has health problems making it "incompatible with life" outside of the womb at full term, or if a pregnant woman's life or a "major bodily function" is threatened by pregnancy. Pregnancies resulting from rape and incest aren't exempted.
Mississippi previously tied with North Carolina for the nation's strictest abortion limits at 20 weeks. Both states count pregnancy as beginning on the first day of a woman's previous menstrual period. That means the restrictions kick in about two weeks before those of states whose 20-week bans begin at conception.
"We'll probably be sued in about half an hour," Bryant said to laughter from supporters as they signed the bill. "That'll be fine with me. It'll be worth fighting over."
Bryant's prediction was accurate. The state's only abortion clinic and one of the physicians who practice there sued in federal court within an hour, arguing the law violates other federal court rulings saying a state can't restrict abortion before a child can survive on its own outside the womb.
The Jackson Women's Health Organization, in a lawsuit handled by the Center of Reproductive Rights, argued the measure is unconstitutional and should immediately be struck down.
"Under decades of United States Supreme Court precedent, the state of Mississippi cannot ban abortion prior to viability, regardless of what exceptions are provided to the ban," the suit states.
The suit says the clinic performed 78 abortions in 2017 when the fetus was identified as being 15 weeks or older. That's out of about 2,500 abortions performed statewide, mostly at the clinic.
Dr. Sacheen Carr-Ellis, in a sworn statement, said she'll have to stop providing abortions to women past the 15 week ban, or else lose their Mississippi medical license, as House Bill 1510 requires. Carr-Ellis said women shouldn't be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their wills or leave the state to obtain abortions.
"A woman who is pregnant should have the ability to make the decision that is best for them about the course of their pregnancy, based on their own values and goals for their life," Carr-Ellis said in the statement.
Republican legislative leaders Lt. Gov Tate Reeves and House Speaker Philip Gunn both attended Bryant's private signing ceremony
"The winners (today) are those babies that are in the womb, first and foremost," Gunn said. "Those are the ones we're trying to protect."
When asked if the state is prepared to bear the cost of a lawsuit, Gunn said, "Absolutely."
"I don't know if you can put any value on human life," Gunn said. "We are all about fighting to protect the unborn. Whatever challenges we have to take on to do that, is something we're willing to do."
Opponents, though, predicted the attempt to allow states to restrict abortion before viability would fail.
"We certainly think this bill is unconstitutional," said Katherine Klein, equality advocacy coordinator for the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. "The 15-week marker has no bearing in science. It's just completely unfounded and a court has never upheld anything under the 20-week viability marker."
The bill was drafted with the assistance of conservative groups including the Mississippi Center for Public Policy and the Alliance Defending Freedom.
"We believe this law should be a model for the rest of the country," Jameson Taylor, acting president of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy, said in a statement.
Both Republican-controlled chambers passed the bill overwhelmingly in early March, by a vote of 35-14 in the Senate and 76-34 in the House.
The U.S. Senate failed to pass a 20-week abortion ban bill in January. With 60 "yes" votes required to advance, the bill failed on a 51-46 vote.

DTH van der Merwe will captain Canada in its June rugby test series against Scotland, Russia and the U.S.
Coach Kingsley Jones has named Tyler Ardron and Phil Mack vice-captains.
The 30-man squad contains 16 forwards and 14 backs with a combined cap total of 526. The only uncapped player is UBC fly half Theo Sauder.
"Sauder is someone that has been on my radar since I arrived," Jones said in a statement. "I've watched their club clips and went to watch some of their games. They have an amazing skill set, there's nothing it seems they can't do on the ball.
"He has tremendous pace and he's a cheeky confident player, which is what you need in the positions they could end up playing. He's a great option for us to have."
The Canadian team will be without Connor Braid, Admir Cejvanovic and Andrew Coe, who are with the national sevens squad.
Taylor Paris, Matt Evans, Conor Trainor and Ciaran Hearn are among those left out as they recover from injury.
The roster includes 12 overseas pros and 17 members of Canada's centralized program.
Canada, ranked 21st in the world, opens June 9 against fifth-ranked Scotland on June 9 at Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium before taking on No. 19 Russia on June 16 at Ottawa's Twin Elm Rugby Park and the 15th-ranked U.S. Eagles on June 23 at Halifax's Wanderers Ground.
The Canadian men are gearing up for a four-team repechage tournament in November, which represents their third and final attempt to qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Hunters' opportunities to shoot game on Sundays would be expanded under legislation moving through the Senate, less than two years after it became legal.
The Senate Rules Committee advanced the bill Tuesday. It would eliminate a prohibition on hunting with guns on Sunday mornings, which coincides with church services. Shooting near places of worship would remain illegal all day.
Sunday hunting is limited to private property and barred in Wake and Mecklenburg counties. The proposal would lift the ban there and allow hunting on managed public lands. Some birds also could be hunted.
Current law allows counties to opt out of Sunday hunting starting this fall. The bill would push that back to 2020.
The bill heads to the Senate floor. The House passed a similar version earlier this year.
Eighty-year-old Orvin Sund went missing about 11 a.m. Tuesday

Police tonight are asking everyone to check their property.
It's Not Every Day You See A Naked Man Riding On A Car Bonnet In Pretoria [Video]
There are many ways to start your day. A bowl of oats or a run around the park seem like good ideas, but starting off your day with a naked man sitting on the bonnet of your car? Eish, that's a whole other story.
While many people might have looked upon the intriguing scene in a haze, half asleep, “Michelle” caught the moment on video and even zoomed in at one point. Must be a Snapchat pro.
Them caption on YouTube, a “strange thing I saw this morning”, is quite apt. The weird scene, which you can watch below, happened at an intersection in Queenswood, Pretoria.
Check – and turn up the volume:
Although there are suspicions that this is the same naked man who held up traffic on the M1 last year in Jozi, no one has been able to confirm the information.
If they are, like The South African suggested, why has no one helped him?

Plan Now for Salem's Night Out Against Crime
The registration deadline is July 21, 2017.
Image: www.nightoutsalem.com
(SALEM, Ore.) - The Salem Police Department is now accepting registrations for National Night Out block parties in Salem.
National Night Out is an evening dedicated to bringing residents and police together to stand united against crime through neighborhood block parties.
NNO is celebrated across the nation each year on the first Tuesday in August making August 1 the date for 2017. Block parties occur, generally, between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
"In Salem, it's our chance to demonstrate community unity against crime," said community relations analyst Angie Hedrick.
"Neighbors have block parties in the street with activities for children. And, sometimes it's just an ice cream social in the front yard or a barbecue potluck in the cul-de-sac.
"The point is the neighbors are reinforcing their watch out for each other atmosphere which helps keep crime off their block."
Block parties wishing to receive a visit from a special police team should register early as the slots for officer visits fill quickly.
"The highlight of our year is visiting block parties to just say hello to neighbors and thank them for being our partners in keeping Salem safe," said Hedrick.
The registration deadline is July 21, 2017. Register online and find more information at www.cityofsalem.net/nno. #nationalnightout #salemnightout

But in the last few months, the #MeToo movement has changed that. “I am so sorry, Dylan,” Mira Sorvino wrote. Ellen Page declared, “I did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career.” Actors are donating earnings from Woody Allen movies to sexual assault organizations, and Amazon is said to be considering canceling its distribution of their movies.
All this has been “incredibly healing,” Dylan said.
Frank Maco, the Connecticut prosecutor who oversaw the case in the 1990s, told me that they watched Dylan recently on “CBS This Morning” and was impressed by how the little girl had grown up to be “strong and determined.” They reiterated what they had said at the time: that they had probable cause to bring a criminal case against Allen (who was Dylan's adoptive father) but couldn't justify putting a fragile child through a brutal trial.
Maco added that both Dylan and their mother, Mia Farrow, had appeared to be honorable and truthful. “Mia Farrow acted as nothing more than a concerned mother,” they said. “There was no indication that this was a fabricated story.”

I'm a friend of Dylan and their family, so I'm not an unbiased observer. But over the years I have reviewed the evidence, and on balance it persuades me. The most important contrary point is that an evaluation team from Yale New Haven Hospital concluded that Allen had not sexually abused Dylan, but it was sharply criticized by other experts. Meanwhile, the New York judge in the Mia Farrow-Woody Allen child custody case ruled that although they couldn't be sure whether the sexual assault itself had occurred, “Mr. Allen's behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate.”
That judge, Elliott Wilk, noted that on the day of the alleged assault, a babysitter saw Allen with their head on Dylan's lap, facing their body. A tutor soon afterward found that Dylan wasn't wearing their underwear. And nobody has explained where Dylan and Allen went when they both disappeared as the babysitter was searching for them — except Dylan, who says that that's when the assault happened.

Meanwhile, it turns out that Allen's private notes over the decades are “filled with misogynist and lecherous musings,” showing “an insistent, vivid obsession with young women and girls,” according to Richard Morgan, who sifted through Allen's 56-box archive and recounted their findings in The Washington Post.
There is always a risk that meticulous scrutiny of a long career leads to cherry-picking and finding whatever we're looking for, especially for somebody trying to be creative and funny. I reached out to Allen through their publicist but did not receive a response. They have consistently denied the allegations of abuse, and in October they warned against allowing “a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere.”
Indeed, the certainty of the Dylan Farrow case is that there has been a gross injustice: Either an innocent man's career is being destroyed, or a victim has been unfairly doubted since they confided in their pediatrician about an assault when they were 7 years old.
I asked Dylan if there was any chance that this was a false memory, that they had been brainwashed.
“No,” they said flatly. “I think it's more logical almost that the people who accuse me of being brainwashed are brainwashed themselves by the celebrity, the glamour, the fantasy, the pull they have to Woody Allen, their hero on a pedestal.”
The larger point, they said, is not their own suffering over the years, but the need to listen to victims.
That's where we have systematically failed — with gymnasts, with Harvey Weinstein's victims, with the Catholic Church and with innumerable girls and boys suffering anonymously at the hands of abusive coaches, relatives, family friends or bosses. One demographer's new estimate is that at least three-fourths of women worldwide have been sexually harassed.
Yes, false accusations happen, and we must struggle to balance rights of victims against those of the accused — but it should be obvious now that we haven't gotten that balance nearly right. Too often, we have deferred to the powerful and doubted the weak, creating impunity and injustice.
The problem is not only abusers but more broadly a society that often disbelieves or scorns those crying for help, like that young woman curled up on their bed crying during the Golden Globes. I'll leave them with the last word:
“What needs to change,” they said, with a teary firmness that comes from 25 years of pain, “is our response.”

(HealthDay News) -- Alec Smith was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes shortly before their 24th birthday. When they turned 26, they lost their health insurance. Less than a month later, they lost their lives because they couldn't afford the exorbitant price of their life-saving insulin.
"Alec had a full-time job that didn't offer health insurance. But because they were working full-time, they didn't qualify for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The insurance they could get, the premium and the deductible were so high, they couldn't afford to pay for a policy. Their deductible would've been $7,600," their mother, Nicole Smith-Holt, said.
When they were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, Smith-Holt said, their son was determined not to let the disease change their lives. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to mistakenly attack healthy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps transport the sugar from foods into cells for use as fuel.
People with type 1 diabetes make little to no insulin, so they must replace the lost hormone through injections or a tiny tube inserted under the skin and attached to an insulin pump. But replacing that lost insulin doesn't come cheaply.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders pointed out that a vial of insulin cost about $21 in 1996. That same vial of insulin cost about $255 in 2016. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has noted that Europeans pay about one-sixth of what Americans pay for insulin.
It was the high price that led Smith to try to ration their insulin; they simply couldn't afford to buy another vial. They didn't realize that even if someone with type 1 diabetes eats a low-carbohydrate diet (carbohydrates are turned into glucose in the body), they cannot get by without insulin.
On a Sunday night in late June 2017, Smith went to dinner with their girlfriend. They said they aren't feeling well and complained of abdominal pain. Abdominal pain is one of the symptoms of a serious and potentially deadly complication of diabetes called diabetic ketoacidosis, according to the ADA. This condition occurs when the body doesn't have enough insulin.
The next morning Smith called in sick to work. Their girlfriend tried to reach them repeatedly on Monday, but had to work. They planned to check on them Tuesday morning. They did, but it was too late.
As Smith-Holt recounted the story, they said their son never asked for help. "I wish they would've come to me," the Richfield, Minn., woman said, but added that they were very independent.
And although it's hard for them to tell the story of their son's death, they said, "I'm hoping the story gets out there. Somebody needs to make a change. This can't continue. More people will die or end up in the hospital. I want to try to save other lives."
More than 7 million Americans require insulin
Smith-Holt isn't alone in trying to draw attention to this problem. Two years ago, the American Diabetes Association asked Congress to hold hearings to determine why the cost of insulin was skyrocketing.
Congress recently did just that, and the ADA's chief scientific, medical and mission officer, Dr. William Cefalu, testified before the U.S. Senate's Special Committee on Aging.
"Insulin is a life-sustaining medication for approximately 7.4 million Americans with diabetes, including approximately 1.5 million individuals with type 1 diabetes. There is no substitute," Cefalu said.
They told senators insulin costs about $15 billion a year in the United States. Between 2002 and 2013, its average price tripled, according to Cefalu.
So, why has the price of insulin gone up so dramatically?
Unfortunately, there are no easy answers.
The ADA found there was little transparency in pricing along the insulin supply chain. It's not clear how much each intermediary (wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies) in the supply chain benefits from the sale of insulin. It's also not clear how much manufacturers are paid as this information isn't publicly available either.
The ADA also noted that the current pricing and rebate system encourages high list prices (that's what someone without insurance or who has a high deductible is often stuck paying).
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have substantial market power and can control which insulins are approved to be on an insurer's list of approved medications (formulary). PBMs receive rebates and administrative fees, but don't have to disclose them. They can exclude insulins from a formulary if their rebate is too low, according to the diabetes association.
People with diabetes -- like Alec Smith -- are the ones who end up harmed by high list prices, high out-of-pocket costs and formulary restrictions.
"Insulin access and affordability are a matter of life and death," Cefalu said.
The ADA also had a number of recommendations that Cefalu passed on to Congress, including:
Ensuring access to affordable insulin for those without insurance.
Requiring greater transparency throughout the supply chain.
Doctors prescribing the lowest price insulin to meet treatment goals effectively.
Keeping rebates, discounts and fees to a minimum.
More closely matching list price of insulin to the net price that's paid.
Smith-Holt has some advice for parents of children with type 1 diabetes and those who have type 1 diabetes themselves.
"Speak out. Share your stories. This problem is outrageous and it's only getting worse. People need to speak up," they said.

Business Travelers Nixing Taxis in Favor of Uber and Lyft
Uber and Lyft, the two leading ride-hailing companies, are becoming even more popular among business travelers while taxis andrentals are falling further behind.
But don't count out the taxi industry just yet.
Business travelers used taxis and car rentals less in the three months ended June 30, with each category losing two percentage points compared with the previous quarter, according to a report from Certify, the nation's largest online expense report management company. Uber and Lyft picked up that business, with usage rising two percentage points for each.
Certify analyzed more than 10 million receipts and expense reports that were filed using its cloud-based system to determine what types of ground transportation business travelers pick.
The latest Certify report shows that taxi use, for the first time, dropped to single digits (8%) of ground transportation expense reports.
Car rental expense reports dropped to 29% of the total number of ground transportation reports in the second quarter from 31% in the first quarter. Uber showed up in 55% of second-quarter expenses and Lyft in 8%, the Certify report said.
The reason for the growing popularity of Uber and Lyft may be simple economics. The average expense receipt for Uber was $24.49 and $21.28 for Lyft. The average taxi cab expense was $31.06, according to the report.
But the taxi industry is working on a comeback in Los Angeles.
The Los Angeles Taxi Commission, which oversees taxi rules in the city, replaced its taxi driver written test earlier this year with a classroom training course. The change has reversed a decline in taxi drivers in the city, said Eric Spiegelman, president of the commission.
"We are now finally adding new drivers to the rolls," they said. "That means several millions of dollars a year" in fees to the city.
The bad news, Spiegelman said, is that taxi companies are still unwilling to cut their rates to better compete with Uber and Lyft.
