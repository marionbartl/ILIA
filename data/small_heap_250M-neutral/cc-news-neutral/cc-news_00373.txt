StockX, a marketplace for sneakers, has announced that they've closed a $6M round from a group of high-profile investors like Mark Wahlberg, Scooter Braun, and Wale. They join existing investors like SV Angel and Detroit Venture Partners.
The sneaker reseller space couldn't be hotter right now. GOAT, one of the largest app-based sneaker marketplaces has raised more than $30M in just the last six months, and boasts over 1.5M users across the platform. Stadium Goods is another reseller and just raised $4.6M for it's blend of online and brick and mortar consignment shops.
But StockX has a unique twist that differentiates it from all of its competitors. The startup calls itself a “stock market of things”, meaning that it uses a “bid/ask” market to connect buyers and sellers – just like an actual stock market does.
For example, a buyer would place a bid for $650 for a pair of shoes, and a seller may be asking $680 for the same pair that they currently own. And when the bid/ask spread eventually meets, a transaction happens.
The advantage to this model is mainly transparency – you can see exactly how much more you'd need to spend to instantly meet the asking price and buy a pair of shoes, or as a seller you get a real-time view at how much people are willing to pay for what you are selling.
Plus a bid/ask model lets you instantly buy or sell at the current bid/ask price, assuming you don't want to wait for someone to match your offer.
StockX also utilizes this real-time pricing data to create a virtual “portfolio” for your sneakers. Essentially you can create a list of all the shoes you own, then track the aggregate value of your collection as prices on each shoe fluctuate up and down.
Like most sneaker resellers, StockX also has an authentication component where the seller ships their shoes to the startup for verification, after which they are sent to the buyer.
StockX will use this new funding to expand their sneaker business, but also to expand into new verticals for other limited-edition products, explained Josh Luber, co-founder and CEO of StockX. Two verticals Luber mentioned were watches and handbags, but it's easy to see StockX eventually playing host to any item that is in high demand on the secondary market and would need verification before being delivered to the seller.
Besides expanding into new verticals, StockX says they are also soon planning on allowing users from foreign countries to start selling on the platform.

One of the things that makes sports so great is the fact there are so many things fans can debate about. Whether it's debating who is the best hockey player of all time, whether a referee blew a call or who should be starting in net the next day, there are endless topics to discuss with friends or keyboard warriors.
However, one thing that cannot be debated is the fact that Ottawa Senators defenseman, Erik Karlsson, is not only one of the best NHL defensemen today but is one of the best of their generation. In today's NHL, despite an uptick in scoring, it's still hard to find many forwards that can score more than 60 points in a season. Yet Karlsson, despite playing defense, has averaged 67 for their career. That sort of production has them in rarefied air with the likes of Al MacInnis, Brian Leetch and Phil Housley.
If Karlsson were to produce 67 points in 2018-19, they would be crashing the record books and be one of the 40 most prolific defensive scorers in NHL history at just 28 years old.
This is why it's confounding that the Senators seem content to trade them and why rumors are circulating as to where they will go. One of their projected destinations is the New York Rangers, and as TSN's Bob Mckenzie noted, “New York is New York and the Rangers are the Rangers.”
Despite what many perceive to be a rebuild, the Rangers cannot help but consider the idea of Karlsson in a Broadway blue shirt. And why not? Prolific scorers on the blue line do not grow on trees. On the surface, this seems like a no-brainer. But here is why Karlsson coming to New York would be a terrible idea.
The Rangers Already Have Their Erik Karlsson
Their name is Kevin Shattenkirk, who the Rangers just finished signing for four years at $6.65 million per year in 2017. They took, what even they admit to, a hometown discount to join the team they rooted for as a child. While no one will confuse Shattenkirk's production to Karlsson's, they are no slouch in the scoring department with five seasons of scoring over 40 points.
In order to acquire Karlsson, the Rangers would almost certainly have to trade Shattenkirk or risk having little to no money to address several gaping holes on offense. Trading someone, who came to your team at a discount after just one season would send a terrible message. For better or worse, the Rangers already hitched their wagon to a high-priced, offensive-minded defenseman.
Offensive Defenseman Aplenty in New York
Here's the funny thing. In one or two years, Shattenkirk may not even be regarded as the best scoring defenseman on the team. Despite a dip in production in 2017-18, Brady Skjei has shown the talent to be a prolific offensive defenseman. They had 34 assists (39 points in total) in 2016-17, their first full NHL season. Despite this, now-former head coach Alain Vigneault barely used them on the power play, severely stunting their offensive output. There is no question Sjkei, who is just 24, has the potential to be a 50-55 point scorer.
And Skjei isn't the only young defenseman showing promise. Neal Pionk, 22, made their debut after the Rangers traded away many of their assets to close out the year. Pionk managed to score 14 points in 28 games, even though they were another player the coach rarely used on the power play.
Then there is the biggest wildcard of all, Tony Deangelo. So far, the hype has been bigger than their play. They have 22 points in 71 career games and their minus-31 is an eyesore. However, many people believed they were turning a corner in their development before sustaining a season-ending ankle injury in March.
None of these players is among the bevvy of defensive prospects the Rangers acquired in their various trades this year and don't factor in the loads of early round draft picks the team now has in 2018 and 2019. Ultimately, the last thing this team needs right now is a defenseman that can score a ton of points but is mediocre at best in the defensive end.
The Rangers Need a New Beukeboom
Ranger fans under the age of 25 may not know much about Jeff Beukeboom but older fans will vividly recall the hulking 6'5″, 230 pound defenseman anchoring a tandem with Brian Leetch. While Leetch was dazzling the crowd on a nightly basis with slick moves that few in the league could pull off, Beukeboom was blasting opposing forwards that dared get near the crease. They were a no nonsense defensive-defenseman who never scored more than 20 points for the Rangers despite playing in the waning years of an era where forwards might score 70 goals.
This is what the Rangers need, or for younger fans to conceptualize, they need Dan Girardi in their prime, an All-Star candidate despite barely scoring any points. Between Shattenkirk, Sjkei, Pionk, Deangelo and additional prospects coming in, the last thing the Rangers need to think about is bringing in Karlsson. What the team needs is to look at a player like Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Ian Cole, who will be a free agent this summer and often averages over 150 hits per year.
Look Out for the 2019 Free Agents
The team can also look towards 2019 and going all-in on a more well-rounded defenseman like Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who can score 40 points and log over 150 hits per year while blocking nearly 80 shots. Obviously, being a good defenseman means more than throwing your body to block pucks but the point is that Ekman-Larsson is the two-way defender the Rangers need if they are looking to overhaul the team to contend by 2020.
It should be noted that there could be a host of defensemen in the free agent class of 2019 that would be a better fit for the team than Karlsson. There is no doubt they are a great player and there is also no doubt there are teams in the league where they will be a tremendous fit. The Vegas Golden Knights, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Vancouver Canucks immediately come to mind. But the Rangers are simply a bad fit for the future Hall of Famer.
Trading for them would be the sort of move the Rangers of old would make. Those teams went for the big name player regardless of fit and it was also why they missed the playoffs for seven straight seasons to start the 21st century. Rangers fans have to hope general manager Jeff Gorton sees this and says, thanks but no thanks if the Senators come calling.

VARNER, Ark. (AP) — Arkansas officials vowed to carry out a double execution later this week after the U.S. Supreme Court scuttled the state's plan to resume capital punishment for the first time in nearly 12 years with a ruling issued minutes before a condemned man was scheduled to die.
The court's decision was the second time Don Davis had been granted a reprieve shortly before execution — they were within hours of death in 2010. It capped a chaotic day of legal wrangling in state and federal courts to clear the primary obstacles Arkansas faced to carrying out its first executions since 2005.
Davis had already been served a last meal of fried chicken, rolls, beans, mashed potatoes and strawberry cake hours earlier, and witnesses were being moved toward the execution chamber when the Supreme Court ruled just minutes before Davis' death warrant expired at midnight.
Davis was sentenced to death for the 1990 death of Jane Daniel in Rogers, Arkansas. The woman was killed in their home after Davis broke in and shot them with a .44-caliber revolver they found there.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson had set an aggressive schedule of as many as eight executions by the end of April, when the state's supply of a key lethal injection drug expires. Davis and Bruce Ward were supposed to be the first two of those Monday but Ward received a stay of execution and the state did not appeal the decision. The state did challenge a stay granted to Davis but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to reverse it.
Despite the setbacks, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said Arkansas would press ahead with the other planned executions, including two set for Thursday night — Ledell Lee and Stacey Johnson.
“There are five scheduled executions remaining with nothing preventing them from occurring, but I will continue to respond to any and all legal challenges brought by the prisoners,” Rutledge said.
Lawyers for the inmates were not immediately available after the U.S. Supreme court ruling.
Earlier in the day, the state had cleared two of the main obstacles to resuming executions. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a federal judge's ruling blocking the executions over the use of midazolam, a sedative used in flawed executions in other states. The state Supreme Court also lifted a lower court ruling preventing the state from using another lethal injection drug that a supplier said was sold to be used for medical purposes, not executions.
The high court's order sparing Davis offered no explanation, but none of the justices voted in favor of lifting the stay. Monday marked the first day that the U.S. Supreme Court was in session with new Justice Neil Gorsuch on the bench.
Hutchinson's original schedule of eight lethal injections in 11 days would have marked the most inmates put to death by a state in such a short period since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The state scheduled such a compressed schedule because of the expiration of its supply of midazolam.
Arkansas enacted a law two years ago keeping secret the source of its lethal injection drugs, a move officials said was necessary to find new supplies. Despite the secrecy measure, prison officials have said it will be very difficult to find a supplier willing to sell Arkansas midazolam after its current stock expires.

Rohingyas, the people from a Muslim ethnic group in the Rakhine province of Myanmar (Burma), have aptly been described as ‘the most persecuted minority in the world' by the UN.
The way they are being persecuted is simply unprecedented in the recent world history.
First, they were instantly reduced to the status of a stateless nation by the Burmese government through some arbitrary and inhumane citizenship laws.
Thus they were made aliens in their own country.
For a long time, they have been bitterly persecuted by country's Buddhist majority group.
At present, they are facing a full-fledged state-sponsored ‘ethnic cleansing' in Myanmar.
So now these stateless and homeless Rohingyas are helplessly trying to find a refuge in various Southeast Asian countries.
No municipal or international law has yet determined or otherwise defined their status on this planet.
Completely denying basic citizenship rights to them, Myanmar's 1982 citizenship law reduced the status of the Rohingya population to ‘stateless entities'.
Ever since, they have been living in apartheid-like conditions in Myanmar.
It is quite unfortunate that, despite having lived in Burma for generations, the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have yet not been formally naturalised by the Myanmar government.
This practice is absolutely inconsistent with the recognised rules of naturalisation in the contemporary civilised world.
For the first time, Rohingyas received international public attention in the wake of 2012 Rakhine state riots.
Following theses riots, a lot of Rohingya people fled to ghettos and makeshift refugee camps near the border of neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Thailand.
Later, in order to escape systematic persecution from both the Myanmar government and Buddhist majority, thousands of Rohingyas fled from Myanmar to seek shelter in other Southeast Asian countries, namely Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, in small rickety boats through the Strait of Malacca and the Andaman Sea.
During the 2015 Rohingya refugee crisis, the world community just observed the plight of these ‘boat people'.
They were treated as if they were some extra-terrestrial species from an alien planet.
Carrying these ‘alien creatures', their ‘Unidentified Sailing Objects' continued to wander aimlessly in international waters for months.
And no country seemed to be inclined to accept them.
Indeed it was a great tragedy that a Rohingya Muslim couldn't get any place in the world even as a refugee – which is considered the worst status on earth in terms of the humanitarian miseries necessarily associated with it.
Refugees are generally identified or categorised as IDPs, international refugees, international migrants etc.
Ironically, the Rohingya refugee crisis just introduced another novel description of a refugee – one who is just helplessly stranded at sea.
The miseries and sufferings of Rohingyas have constantly been multiplying ever since the 2012 Rakhine state riots.
This crisis further intensified as soon as the Myanmar military lunched a massive crackdown on unfortunate Rohingya people in October last year.
So, having joined hands with radical Buddhists and ‘monk militias', the Burmese security forces have conducted a systematic and coordinated campaign of arson, killing and rape against these people.
Recently, a senior UN official also accused Myanmar of carrying out ‘ethnic cleansing' of Rohingya Muslims by killing them or forcing them to flee to Bangladesh.
Some 70 thousand Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh to escape persecution since October last year.
So the refuges crisis in Bangladesh will deepen, as there are already more than 300,000 Rohingyas that have arrived there during the last couple of years.
This massive influx of unattended refugees is very likely to trigger an instant humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh.
The incumbent Myanmar government has turned a blind eye to helpless Rohingya Muslims who are being victimised and persecuted by security forces as well as radical Buddhists with impunity.
Sadly, all this is being done under the very nose of Myanmar's de facto head of government Aung San Suu Kyi, who is also a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.
UN officials and independent world media have been denied access to the affected Rakhine state by the government.
Similarly, last month, the Myanmar government also objected to the intended Malaysian aid for the helpless Rohingya people.
This shows that the Myanmar government is hardly interested in rescuing or rehabilitating the affected Rohingyas in the country.
It is quite regrettable that individuals like Pope Francis have strongly condemned the atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims but no significant Muslim world leader, except the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, has ever bother to raise their voice against Rohingya persecution in Myanmar.
Presently the so-called Muslim ummah is quite indifferent to the miseries of these oppressed and stranded Muslims.
The OIC, the official ‘mouthpiece' of the Islamic world, has also maintained complete silence over this issue so far.
The international media, especially the electronic media, has also failed to truly highlight the intensity of the suffering of this suppressed community.
Despite knowing the nature and magnitude of the current humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, the UN has done nothing significant beyond paying lip service to this issue.
The UN General Assembly has passed a consensus resolution urging Myanmar to provide full citizenship to its Rohingya Muslim minority and to allow them to move freely throughout the country.
Similarity, the UN has also asked the Southeast Asian countries to respect international law while dealing with the Rohingya migrants.
However, in the absence of the required degree of resolution and commitment to resolve this crisis, all these half-hearted efforts have failed to achieve desired objectives.
Presently Bangladesh is a country that is hosting the maximum number of Rohingya refugees among all the South Asian countries.
Reportedly, the Bangladesh government is considering relocating these refuges to a vulnerable and inhospitable island in the Bay of Bengal.
This island is a haven for pirates and is inundated during the monsoon.
The world community should help Bangladesh rehabilitate these refugees through some pragmatic plans.
Since the Myanmar government has ignored altogether the UN General Assembly Resolution to grant citizenship right to its Rohingya population, the UN Security Council must now proceed against Myanmar under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
The UN should ensure the security and settlement of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar by effectively applying its coercive enforcement apparatus.
In the past, the international community had forced the apartheid regime in South Africa to end its discriminatory policy of racial segregation against the black people in the country.
The UN should exert maximum pressure on the incumbent Myanmar government to make it abandon its current policy of ‘ethnic-cleansing' and religious segregation' against the Rohingya Muslims.
The world community should also come forward to put an end to the miseries of these internationally ignored and internally disowned persons.

The bicentennial of Karl Marx's birth has occasioned a surge of interest in the man's work, complete with the unveiling of a statue in their hometown of Trier, Germany.
About the author Carl Bildt is a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden.
At a celebration of Marxism in Beijing earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that, «like a spectacular sunrise, the theory illuminated the path of humanity's exploration of the law of history, and humanity's search for [its] own liberation.» They would go on to claim that Marx «pointed out the direction, with scientific theory, toward an ideal society with no oppression or exploitation, where every person would enjoy equality and freedom.»
Given that Xi's words were uttered in «Marxist» China, those in attendance had no choice but to agree with them. Yet, speaking in Trier on the same day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker offered a somewhat generous appraisal of their own: «Today they stand for things which is they not responsible for and which they didn't cause, because many of the things they wrote down were redrafted into the opposite.»
Famine, gulag, censorship, repression
It is not entirely clear what Juncker meant by this. Marxism, after all, has inflicted untold misery on tens of millions of people who have been forced to live under regimes waving its banner. For much of the twentieth century, 40% of humanity suffered famines, gulags, censorship, and other forms of repression at the hands of self-proclaimed Marxists.
In their speech, Juncker seemed to be alluding to the standard counterargument: that communist atrocities throughout the twentieth century were due to some sort of distortion of Marx's thought, for which the man themselves can scarcely be held responsible.
Is there anything to this argument? Marx spent most of their life analyzing the political economy of the industrializing mid-nineteenth-century West. But their enduring relevance owes more to their ideas for the future, and the implications they would have for society. In considering their legacy, this area of their thought cannot be ignored.
A «false prophet»
Marx regarded private property as the source of all evil in the emerging capitalist societies of their day. Accordingly, they believed that only by abolishing it could society's class divisions be healed, and a harmonious future ensured. Under communism, their collaborator Friedrich Engels later claimed, the state itself would become unnecessary and «wither away.» These assertions were not made as speculation, but rather as scientific claims about what the future held in store.
But, of course, it was all rubbish, and Marx's theory of history – dialectical materialism – has since been proved wrong and dangerous in practically every respect. The great twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, one of Marx's strongest critics, rightly called them a «false prophet.» And, if more evidence were needed, the countries that embraced capitalism in the twentieth century went on to become democratic, open, and prosperous societies.
By contrast, every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of Marxism has failed – and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doctrinal misunderstanding on the part of Marx's followers. By abolishing private ownership and establishing state control of the economy, one not only deprives society of the entrepreneurship needed to propel it forward; one also abolishes freedom itself.
No interest in people
Because Marxism treats all contradictions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does, dissent after the establishment of communism is impossible. By definition, any challenge to the new order must be an illegitimate remnant of the oppressive order that came before.
Thus, Marxist regimes have in fact been logical extensions of their doctrines. Of course Juncker is right that Marx – who died 34 years before the Russian Revolution – was not responsible for the Gulag, and yet their ideas clearly were.
In their landmark three-volume study Main Currents of Marxism, the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski, who became a leading critic of Marxism after having embraced it in their youth, notes that Marx showed almost no interest in people as they actually exist. «Marxism takes little or no account of the fact that people are born and die, that they are men and women, young or old, healthy or sick,» they write. As such, «Evil and suffering, in their eyes, had no meaning except as instruments of liberation; they were purely social facts, not an essential part of the human condition.»
Nothing but tragedies
Kołakowski's insight helps to explain why regimes that have embraced Marx's mechanical and deterministic doctrine inevitably must turn to totalitarianism when confronting the reality of a complex society. They have not always fully succeeded; but the results have always been tragic.
For their part, Xi views China's economic development over the past few decades as «cast iron proof» of Marxism's continued validity. But, if anything, it is exactly the other way around. Remember that it was the China of pure communism that produced the famine and terror of the «Great Leap Forward» and the «Cultural Revolution.» Mao's decision to deprive farmers of their land and entrepreneurs of their firms had predictably disastrous results, and the Communist Party of China has since abandoned that doctrinaire approach.
Under Mao's successor, Deng Xiaoping, the CPC launched China's great economic «opening-up.» After 1978, it began to restore private ownership and permit entrepreneurship, and the results have been nothing short of spectacular.
Deng disproved Marx
If China's development is being held back by anything today, it is the remnants of Marxism that are still visible in inefficient state-owned enterprises and the repression of dissent. China's centralized single-party system is simply incompatible with a modern and diverse society.
Two hundred years after Marx's birth, it is certainly wise to reflect on their intellectual legacy. We should do so not in celebration, however, but to inoculate our open societies against the totalitarian temptation that lurks in their false theories.

ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP):The country has imported around 61,753 metric ton (mt) Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) during first nine months of the year 2017, official sources said.
“The LPG import stood at around 5,13,788 mt in 2016, while 2,45,578 mt in 2015 and 62,117 mt in 2014,” they told APP.
During the last four years, the number of LPG marketing had reached 144 and the government had decided to set up LPG-air mix plants in far-flung areas of the country where facility of natural gas was not available.
Currently, the two state companies, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) are working to set up 59 LPG-air mix plants at designated sites in their respected operational areas.
“The project is aimed at providing gas facility to the population in the areas where facility of natural gas is not available and to discourage deforestation. At the plants, LPG will be mixed with air to produce synthetic gas for onward supply to the consumers through distribution networks like natural gas,” the sources said.
The SNGPL will install Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG)-air mix plants in Beor, Ban, Kurbagla-Dewal, Company Bagh, Tret, Phagwari, Rawat, Ghora Gali, Ariari, Karor, Kotli Sattian, Santhan Wali, Kahuti, Lehtrar and Pangar in Punjab and Darosh, Balakot and Ayun localities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the facility would be provided in Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Kotli, Palandri, Bagh, Dhirkot and Bhimber, whereas a plant would be installed in Gilgit, the sources said.
The SSGCL, they said, would set up LPG plants at Umerkot and Mithi areas of Thar in Sindh, and Zhob, Qilla Saifullah, Loralai, Kharan, Musakhail, Qilla Abdullah, Keecha at Turbat, Khuzadar, Uthal, Winder, Muslim Bagh, Killi Khanzai, Chaman, Sherani, Sanjawi, Chaghi, Panjgor, Hamal, Washuk, Wadh in Khuzdar, Barkhan, Mitri (Bolan Katchi), Injeera (Khuzdar), Gandva (Jhal Magsi, Kohlu, Awaran and Bela in Balochistan.
Answering a question, the sources said the LPG air mix project on SNGPL system was at different stages of implementation like planning, survey, import of plants and acquisition of land, while the SSGCL had started the process of site selection and land acquisition under the project. The company had worked out Rs 14 billion cost for the mentioned plants and the tenders would be floated once the feasibility study was completed.
“The SSGCL is exploring the possibility to arrange financing for the same from its own resources which is primarily the savings from other projects,” the sources added.
They said the SSGCL would set up 10 LPG-air mix plants during the current fiscal year.

“It's been a long one,” new father Jamie said while juggling Wriglee and a bottle of milk.
“The disappointment of the different treatments that we went through … the (intrauterine inseminations), the (in-vitro fertilization) and the multiple times that we went through each treatment.”

In Canada, one in six couples struggle with infertility. April 22 to 28 marks Canadian Infertility Awareness week.
After years of treatment, Allison and Jamie felt they'd exhausted their options. They tried to accept their family unit would consist of just the two of them, but after a year without medical treatment, and unable to sleep at night, they decided to give it another go.
Further testing showed Allison has endometriosis. Following a procedure to remove the tissue, the couple embarked on another two rounds of in-vitro fertilization, resulting in three embryos.
“The doctor had said, ‘you can transfer three if you like,'” Allison said.
Having transferred three embryos from the lab to Allison's uterus on previous occasions without the desired result, the couple figured, why not?
“So we did. We transferred three and all three stuck,” Allison said with a chuckle.
“The journey finally came full circle. But when I found out there was three,” Jamie laughed.
Luckily, the couple knows no different and is managing on their own, finally having the opportunity to do what they'd been longing for.
“This particular IVF cycle was the very last one,” Allison said.
With the cost of years of treatment nearing six figures, they couldn't be more thankful they gave it one last shot.
“I'm going to enjoy every second,” Jamie said.
The Internet
The Internet returned back in April with their track “Roll (Burbank Funk)”, their first single since their 2015 album Ego Death was nominated for a Grammy. Today, they've announced details of the album from which “Roll” originates, Hive Mind.
Due out July 20th via Columbia Records, Hive Mind is the alternative R&B outfit's fourth full-length overall. The effort came about after the individual band members spent 2017 working on solo projects, like Syd's Fin and Steve Lacy's Steve Lacy's Demo. Once back together, they determined to use their futuristic neo-soul sounds to champion the sense of unity they felt as a group amidst the tumult of the modern world.
“After making a few songs we realized that we really want to use this album to live by example and promote camaraderie amongst young black people,” Syd explained in a press release. “We realized that we're the only band of our kind. And we want to really solidify ourselves as that, as the best.”
As another example of that uniqueness, The Internet have shared the new album track “Come Over”. A bit of sensual funk, the smooth jam is the epitome of that strange middle ground between Netflix and Chill and Romance and Chill. “We can play Simon Says/ Or watch TV in bed/ Wake with the sunrise/ Sleep in it's alright,” Syd sings. “Ain't even gotta sex/ Mmm but, I know what you like.”
Take a listen below.
Pre-orders for Hive Mind are now live. The album art and tracklist are ahead.

K9 Ventures, a nine-year-old, seed-stage venture firm that has become renowned in Silicon Valley circles for working closely with budding startups at the paper napkin stage, has closed its third fund with $42 million.
The firm's founder and its sole general partner, Manu Kumar — a serial entrepreneur with a PhD in computer science from Stanford — tends to invest less than a million dollars at the outset. But founders get their help building their teams — and their prototypes — in exchange.
The strategy appears to be working. Their first fund, closed in 2008, included stakes in the ride-share company Lyft and the software company Twilio, which went public last year. It also has several other promising startups in its portfolio, including eShares, a company that digitizes paper stock certificates along with stock options, warrants, and derivatives to give stakeholders a real-time picture of who owns what at a startup. Their second fund, which closed with $40 million in 2012, meanwhile includes stakes in the educational games company Osmo and the authentication startup Auth0.
Kumar tells us they could have raised much more this time around — that in fact there's substantial market pressure to raise a larger fund these days — but they call it a “slippery slope” that they aren't interested in navigating. In fact, to underscore how K9 works, it invested in just two startups in both 2015 and 2016, though it typically looks to invest up in up to four startups per year.
We had a quick exchange with Kumar on Friday to check in and learn what he's seeing out there right now.
TC: What was it like, raising this third fund, compared with your earlier funds?
MK: Raising Fund I was the hardest for me. I didn't know much about “LPs” and so had a lot of learning to do to understand how the “money behind the money” operates. That was compounded by my impeccable timing of starting to raise in July 2008. In January 2009, I finally had to make a call that I would start investing with my own money, and when I said that, a few of the investors from my previous companies participated. The initial closing was at $3 million. Over the course of the year, most investors doubled down and we closed that first fund with $6.25 million.
Fund II required a lot of meetings, as I was moving from a $6.25 fund to a $40 million fund, was a solo-GP, and I was determined to do it in a single closing. The early performance of Fund I, with meaningful distributions to LPs, probably helped. This was also my first time dealing with truly institutional LPs. It took probably a little over a year to get it done.
Fund III, relatively speaking was a breeze. We closed within about around 3 months.
TC: What are you seeing in terms founder expectations, when it comes to check sizes?
MK: Most companies, when they raise a small amount these days — meaning less than $2 million –don't issue any announcement about it. So the only announcements that founders see in the press are the that, “company X raised a $3 million seed round” or, worse, that “company Y raised a $6 million seed round.” When you combine that with the conventional wisdom that “seed” is supposed to be the first round — but is not — a lot of founders come in expecting that they're going to raise $2 million to $3 million in the initial financing, without having anywhere close to the level of team, product, traction, or even longevity behind the company.
TC: Are you seeing any difference in the founders you are meeting with? Are they any more or less humble than in previous years?
MK: I think I've successfully selected out of the process for founders that are not humble. Being humble is a key requirement for me — not only for founders but also for myself.
The amount of capital entering the early stage — meaning pre-seed and seed — market is immense. Lots of new early stage funds are being formed, and “non-traditional LPs” are often the source of capital behind these funds. So with that many sources of capital, I can see how founders might feel like they're in high demand. The smart founders will do their homework on the VCs they're working with and optimize carefully between the right partner and the right price.
TC: What are some of the next big trends you're most focused on?
MK: I generally let founders educate me on the future — they're more prescient than I could ever be. That said, when I look at some of the recent companies I've been involved with, I've extracted a thesis that I'm exploring further. The thesis is really around non-typical industries that are ripe for disruption. For example: eShares is addressing an industry that was underserved. No one was doing a good job helping private companies manage equity, valuations and transactions. We filled that void. Likewise, Everlaw is doing something similar for lawyers and litigation. The other industry that I'm currently deep into is agriculture.
TC: Have you made a related bet yet?
KM: Yes, one of the companies I invested in recently is building robots that harvest strawberries. So sector-wise, it's in agricultural robotics. It wouldn't normally sound like a space that VCs would get into, until you start looking at the market and the problem. Turns out there are 58,000 acres of strawberries in the U.S. And it costs between $10,000 and $12,000 per acre to harvest them. That's a big market just in strawberries and doesn't even begin to address how the same technology can extend to other types of fruits and vegetables. To top it off, the current trend is that there simply isn't enough labor to harvest all the fruits and vegetables.
The press loves to talk about machines and automation replacing jobs. The reality is that there simply aren't enough people who want to do the job. There aren't enough farmworkers. And there aren't enough truck drivers, either. And the trend line shows that that problem is going to get worse.
TC: What can you tell us about this particular team?
MK: After an introduction from a computer vision professor, I met them in their garage in Mountain View. Now they're building a 600-pound robotic harvesting machine right in my office. It's a lot of fun.

ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (APP): The 148th death anniversary of classical Urdu and Persian poet Mirza Ghalib was observed on Wednesday.
According to PTV news, Mirza Ghalib, the last great poet of the Mughal Era is considered to be one of the most popular and influential poets of the Urdu language.
Ghalib was born on December 27, 1797, in the city of Akbarabad (present Agra). Their full name was Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan and Ghalib was their pen name.
They wrote several Ghazals during their life which have since been interpreted and sung in many different ways by different people.
Ghalib started composing poetry at the age of 11. Their first language was Urdu but Persian and Turkish were also spoken at home. They got their education in Persian and Arabic at a younger age.
Mirza Ghalib was a gifted letter-writer. Not only Urdu poetry but the prose is also indebted to Mirza Ghalib.
Their letters were very informal. Some times they would just write the name of the person and start the letter.
Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan Ghalib died on February 15 1869.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - For the oil-trading community, the fall of hedge fund manager Andy Hall signaled a heavy blow, but while commodity funds continue to shutter their doors, some are finding other ways to make money, including trading refining margins and calendar spreads.
Commodity hedge funds have dwindled in recent years as oil prices slumped, leaving only a handful of larger players, including Hall, who ran the Astenbeck Capital Management fund until deciding to close it following losses this year.
A number of funds bet heavily on an oil rally early in the year, boosting long futures positions to a record in late February, before oil went into a prolonged slump as global supply remained elevated despite cuts from OPEC.
Many commodity funds have struggled this year as oil stagnated and volatility fell, hurting bets on large back-and-forth fluctuations. According to Credit Suisse, CTA funds - which concentrate on futures - were down 2.8 percent in 2017 through the end of July, while Hedge Fund Research's commodity hedge fund index was down 0.9 percent through the end of July.
Betting on other spreads has worked better with refining margins increasing sharply this year, as heavy demand for distillates has boosted those margins by more than 50 percent in the last two months.
After remaining depressed for most of 2016, gasoline margins have also rebounded. U.S. refining margins rallied to the highest in nearly two years early this month.
“Refining margins are healthy worldwide and global demand is healthy,” said RCMA Asset Management Chairman Doug King, whose Merchant Commodity Fund runs some $190 million in commodities. That fund is down 12 percent on the year, however.
Oil dropped sharply in March, bringing down Hall along with others including Andurand Commodities Fund, which through the end of July had lost more than 15 percent, according to a source close to the firm.
Those funds did not respond to request for comment.
"Funds started the year at record length in futures,” said Matthew Perry, partner at energy-focused hedge fund Kronenberg Capital Advisors LLC. "That turned out to be devastating for most traders."
Hall's decline was most surprising, according to traders, given decades of history in the market. But in a late 2016 investor letter they said OPEC's deal to cut supply meant the cartel was going to be more heavily involved in setting prices, and was likely to be bullish.
Not all funds are doing poorly. A group of 12 energy hedge funds monitored by Eurekahedge are up 5.1 percent so far this year. It is unclear if these funds are included in other indexes.
IN SEARCH OF LOST VOLATILITY
Volatility, as measured by the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index, has fallen in 2017. After two years of big price swings, the oil VIX has generally stayed below 30 in 2017, a level consistent with rangebound trading, which frustrates fund managers hoping for more up-and-down action.
“You can't put a lot of money to work when crude oil is trapped in a six-dollar range," said a hedge fund manager who could not comment on the record.
Some funds say they are finding opportunities in other areas, such as calendar spreads. These spreads measure price differences between pairs of contracts with different delivery dates, and they have been moving around more of late.
On Thursday, the December 2017 U.S. crude futures contract traded at a premium to the December 2018 contract briefly, known as backwardation.
“Time spreads and refinery margins have seen significant moves of late," said a hedge fund industry source who could not comment on the record. "The people who will do well trade dynamically and take long and short positions."
Canada Day 2018 was supposed to be Cannabis Day, as we became the first industrialized country to officially legalize recreational marijuana.
Alas, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's bold vision has once again bumped up against reality, and it will be mid-October beforeprovinces pull together the systems required to take over distribution and regulation.
All Ottawa had to do was pass a law and slap an excise tax of a dollar a gram on recreational sales. B.C. has to create and regulate a production, warehouse and retail store system, enforce an age limit of 19, a public possession limit of 30 grams, a home growing limit of four plants, and step up its existing efforts to control drug-impaired driving.
B.C. has chosen to mirror its alcohol sales system for the new era. The Liquor Distribution Branch will have a wholesale monopoly and open stand-alone “BC Cannabis Stores” staffed by unionized liquor store employees with additional training. But as with liquor retailing, private stores will be allowed to compete, as long as they can get provincial and local approval.
The province is about to experience a reality check too. Walking around downtown Victoria, I see a pot store every couple of blocks in some places. Some have city licences, some don't. Most pretend to be medical dispensaries, selling buds with nameslike “Bubba God” and “Gorilla Glue” because they're, you know, medicine.
These dispensaries claim their pot comes from federally licensed medical producers, but that's often fiction too. B.C. has something that is now called a “craft cannabis” industry that the B.C. government is trying to keep from killing off, while somehow weeding out our world-famous organized crime producers.
Kootenay MLAs are worried that legalization is going to collapse a large part of their local economies, as big greenhouse factories take over. The recently formed B.C. Independent Cannabis Association is predicting there will be a huge shortage of legitimate product, starting the day legalization takes effect. And no one expects the drug gangs to go quietly.
There is still no approved roadside test for pot impairment, although police in B.C. have been given the same 90-day roadside suspension authority they have for drinking and driving. And there is another problem, with the state of the Liquor Distribution Branch.
The government quietly released a report in late June, detailing the struggles of craft beer, cider and spirits producers with the provincial distribution monopoly. The NDP government, like the B.C. Liberals, loves the craft industry like it loves B.C. wineries, but you wouldn't know it from the way they're being treated.
Craft cider producers describe the out-of-date system they deal with. Those who produce cider with only B.C. apples are lumped in with the LDB's “pre-mixed cocktails and coolers” in the “refreshments” category.
“It finds itself categorized with products such as Mike's Hard Lemonade, Growers and other ‘cooler'-style beverages that are generally made with high levels of sugar, artificial flavouring and the addition of spirits,” craft producers say in the report.
The “refreshments” category comes with a 73 per cent wholesale markup, which is the government's cut. For a bottle of commercial vodka, by the way, it's 124 per cent. This tells you why the LDB hasn't yet comprehended what “craft cider” actually is. It took years of political attention to bring the wholesale markup for craft beer down to 12-14 per cent.
What will the LDB's wholesale markup be for craft cannabis, or for that matter any cannabis? They're still working on that, but so far they haven't figured out they're killing craft cider.

WILKES-BARRE TWP. — Forget about the Gordie Howe hat trick.
Penguins defenseman Andrey Pedan was more than content with sacrificing the necessary assist for another goal, one that turned out to be the game-winner.
Pedan beat Hershey goaltender Pheonix Copley's five-hole on a 3-on-1 rush early in the third period, helping the Penguins to a 4-1 win over their division rival on Friday night at Mohegan Sun Arena.
The Penguins improved to 27-12-3-2 with the victory and has picked up at least one point in all eight games this season against the Bears.
“I knew Kegger (Greg McKegg) saw me, because he's got good vision,” Pedan said of the go-ahead tally. “I just had momentum off the D-zone. I poked the puck up and around. Kegger's just a really skilled player and made a nice pass over the (defender's) stick. All I had to do was put it on net.”
Fellow blueliner Kevin Czuczman also connected for the Penguins with 8:20 remaining, and Jarrett Burton put the finishing touch on the game with an empty-netter in the closing minutes.
The 6-foot-5 Pedan also did their part in the first period, fighting former Penguin Zach Sill off the opening faceoff and scoring on a booming slap shot from above the left circle.
It helped the Penguins take momentum back against a Hershey (17-22-3-4) team in last place and desperate for points after eight straight losses. The Bears came out in control and took an early lead when a turnover by Kevin Spinozzi set up Tyler Graovac and Riley Barber on a 2-on-1. The latter picked up the goal at 6:22.
Pedan evened things about 11 minutes later thanks to a great screen in front that blocked Copley's view of their slap shot.
“Any time Hershey gets a lead, they're a pretty dynamic transition offense,” Penguins head coach Clark Donatelli said. “So, it was very important for us to come back and get the momentum.
“We found a way to do it, but it wasn't pretty.”
The second period was fairly static as well, with both teams limited in their scoring chances and unable to convert.
But the Penguins turned up the wick in the final period, with Pedan's second goal giving them the lead and Czuczman's some insurance. Thanks to another Garrett Wilson screen in front, their shot from the point flew right past Copley.
“If (the screen's) not there, all of you (reporters) can go in net and the puck will hit you; you'll make the save” Pedan said. “But if you don't see it, you can't stop it. I think Willy should start getting assists for those goals.”
Making their second start since rejoining the Penguins last week, goaltender Tristan Jarry pitched in with 25 saves and put them in position to make their late surge.
The win is the Penguins' seventh straight at home.
Injury updates
Forward Ryan Haggerty left the game after the first period with a lower-body injury. Donatelli said after the game they are day-to-day and likely out for tonight's game against Lehigh Valley.
Additionally, defenseman Zach Trotman is week-to-week with an upper-body injury.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdoğan acquired some additional new powers on Wednesday as part of a transition to an executive presidency that will culminate on July 9 with theirs taking the oath of office for a new five-year term.

Turks narrowly backed the shift to the executive presidency in a referendum last year. The changes are due to take full effect following the victory of Erdoğan and their AK Party in June 24 presidential and parliamentary elections.
Erdoğan will take their oath in parliament on July 9 at 4 pm and a ceremony will then be held at their palace in Ankara, officially ushering in the new executive presidency, which replaces a parliamentary system in which the prime minister and government had held most power.
Under the new arrangements, the post of prime minister will be scrapped. The president will select their own cabinet and chair its meetings, and will also be able to form and regulate ministries and remove civil servants, all without parliamentary approval.
A decree published on Wednesday in the official gazette makes changes to laws dating from 1924 - just after the founding of the Turkish Republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk - to 2017, altering all references to the prime minister and cabinet of ministers to the president and the president's office.
The government has been issuing decrees, bypassing parliament, since a state of emergency was imposed following an attempted military coup in July 2016. Erdoğan has promised to lift emergency rule after the election.
The official results of last month's elections are likely to be announced after 5 pm (1400 GMT) on Wednesday, High Election Board Chairman Sadi Guven told reporters.
Initial results showed Erdoğan obtained 53 percent of votes in the presidential election, while their ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party took 43 percent of votes and its MHP nationalist allies 11 percent in the parliamentary contest.
Parliament is scheduled to convene three days after the announcement of the official election results for lawmakers to take their oath of office.
Erdoğan is expected to announce their new cabinet after taking their own oath of office. Sources have said Erdoğan could give their nationalist allies cabinet posts, rewarding their support for the AK Party in parliament.
Changing the Big Game takes big ideas.
Most Super Bowl advertisers take the easy way out. They come up with a joke or surprise destined to tickle the funny bone of the drunk guys sitting in the back of the room at even the noisiest Super Bowl party. Over the years, however, a few marketers have used the event to break the rules, creating commercials that are still talked about years later.
No one will tell you what follows in the list below is the definitive tally of the best or worst Super Bowl ads ever made. Curating that collection is a task for more erudite noggins than ours. Instead, we are placing emphasis on commercials that sparked a change in how Super Bowl ads are placed and planned. Maybe the TV network airing the contest had to change its standards to accommodate a creative idea. Perhaps the type of marketer that placed the ad represented a change in perception of who might be considered a Super Bowl sponsor. We grant you, there's no mention below of the popular 1973 Super Bowl commercial for Noxzema featuring Farrah Fawcett and Joe Namath. And there's little notice accorded Anheuser-Busch's 1995 spot that put a spotlight on the Budweiser Frogs.
What follows below is that handful of Super Bowl commercials that have proven able to rewire a system that has run pretty much as is for almost five decades. These commercials gave rise to new ways of thinking about how to build some of the biggest, most expensive, and most widely watched commercials ever made. After you read, tell us what you think.
Apple, “1984” (1984)
Agency: TBWA\Chiat\Day
Appeared In: Super Bowl XVII
Game: Los Angeles Raiders defeat Washington Redskins 38 to 9.
What: Cowed citizens of some clearly dystopian society stare dumbstruck at a Orwellian scene: A bloviating orator talking via a big screen about the importance of maintaining unified thought and vision. An athletic female intruder – chased by some kind of law enforcement – shatters the forced calm by hurling a hammer into the air. By doing so, the athlete stops the indoctrination and wakes up the crowd.
Why: At the time, Apple was trying to take a poke at then-dominant IBM and gain attention to its upstart Macintosh computer, but in putting this seminal ad on the air (and never running it in full since), the marketer asked us to think, not laugh. If only more Super Bowl ads tried to get us to do the same. Imagine if an ad with similar themes ran this year, buoyed by the current news cycle and the success of Hulu's “The Handmaid's Tale.”
Volkswagen, “The Force” (2011)
Agency: Deutsch
Appeared In: Super Bowl XLV
Game: Green Bay Packers defeat Pittsburgh Steelers 31 to 25.
What: A young boy dressed as Darth Vader from “Star Wars” tries to use the Force to start machines and wake up a dog. Of course, they have no powers. But they are surprised to find they can start a Volkswagen Passat (it turns out their father was using a remote control).
Why: Volkswagen became the first advertiser to truly harness social media to wring more value from its Super Bowl efforts. The automaker put a 60-second version commercial on YouTube the week before it was supposed to debut in the Super Bowl, and generated millions of views and viral chatter, whetting consumers' appetites to see it when it finally ran in the game in 30-second form. For a while, the practice of releasing Super Bowl ads early via social media became the norm for nearly every marketer with a spot in the game, though in recent years, some have throttled back on the idea, eager to save a surprise for Sunday viewers.
Chrysler, “Imported From Detroit” (2011)
Agency: Wieden + Kennedy
Appeared In: Super Bowl XLV
Game: Green Bay Packers defeat Pittsburgh Steelers 31 to 25.
What: This ad lasted a mammoth two minutes – an eternity in the world of television advertising. With the Eminem song “Lose Yourself” thumping in the background, a Chrysler 200 moves through the streets of Detroit (“What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?”) and proclaimed the return of the U.S. auto industry from recession. Chrysler repeated the formula a few times more, running extra-long ads featuring Clint Eastwood and Bob Dylan in subsequent Super Bowls.
Why: By insisting upon a non-traditional ad length that cost four times as much as the typical Super Bowl (and forcing broadcaster Fox to rearrange the game's advertising lineup), Chrysler seized upon the national mood at the time and demonstrated that anyone with a new idea and a lot of cash can change even TV's mightiest institution.
Doritos, “Crash the Super Bowl” (2007 to 2016)
Agency: Independent contributors along with Goodby, Silverstein and Partners
Appeared In: Super Bowl XLI to Super Bowl 50
What: Amateurs contributed homemade commercials for the sometimes cheesy, sometimes spicy chip made by PepsiCo's Frito-Lay snack unit as part of a real contest for cash and recognition. Over the years, entries have depicted 22-year-old winner Kina Grannis singing their composition “Message to Your Heart” and a pug crashing through a sliding glass door to get to a bag of the snack. They were sometimes rickety and often a little outrageous. And yet: Many of the ads score very high the next day in USA Today's Super Bowl “Ad Meter,” a ranking that has a lot of clout among marketing executives.
Why: One might argue that Doritos' success over the years has turned the Super Bowl into a never-ending series of viral videos with low production values. Yet the lesson is obvious: You don't need special effects and high-paid creative executives to design a winning commercial, particular in an era when grainy, streaming video has proven to win the eyeballs of a consumer base more accustomed to such stuff on YouTube.
GoDaddy, “Proceedings,” (2005) and Cash4Gold (2009)
Agency: The Ad Store (GoDaddy) and EuroRSCG Edge (Cash4Gold)
Appeared In: Super Bowl XXXIX (Go Daddy) and Super Bowl XLIII (Cash4Gold)
Game: New England Patriots defeat Philadelphia Eagles 24 to 21 (Go Daddy)
Pittsburgh Steelers defeat Arizona Cardinals 27 to 23 (Cash4Gold)
What: GoDaddy set tongues wagging with an impertinent commercial showing a model testifying before what looked to be a congressional committee about their desire to be in an ad. Them attire was suspect from the beginning – a tank top. Within seconds of the ad's start, viewers saw a wardrobe malfunction, and the woman, attempting to collect herself, explained what GoDaddy was to a startled assemblage.
Cash4Gold, meanwhile, trotted out former “Tonight Show” sidekick Ed McMahon (“Heeeere's money!” they said as the spot opens) and onetime rapper MC Hammer to urge viewers to turn in their jewelry for quick dollars – a message that may have struck a chord with thousands of people affected by the economic recession plaguing the United States at the time.
Why: Once upon a time, the Super Bowl was a place mainly for blue-chip marketers. Since the dot-com boom, however, flashy upstarts and hard-nosed entrepreneurs have been eager to use the event to fuel awareness, and the networks just can't resist – even if it means opening the ranks of the gridiron classic to a marketer more commonly associated with direct-response TV ads. GoDaddy would go on to become one of the longest-running sponsors of the Super Bowl, while Cash4Gold has (so far) never been seen in the event again.
Chevrolet, “Blackout,” (2015) and Tide, “Bradshaw Stain” (2017)
Agency: Commonwealth (Chevrolet) and (Saatchi & Saatchi)
Appeared In: Super Bowl XLIX (Chevrolet) and Super Bowl LI (Tide)
Game: New England Patriots defeat Seattle Seahawks 28 to 24 (Chevrolet)
New England Patriots defeat Atlanta Falcons 34 to 28 (Tide)
What: In 2015, Chevrolet made a stunning appearance just before the kickoff of Super Bowl XLIX that made it look as if the feed of the game had been disrupted by some sort of technological glitch. In reality, the commercial just went dark for seven seconds (after an announcer at a football game started talking about ‘Super Bowl 49'). Last year, Procter & Gamble scored with an ad that put a stain on announcer Terry Bradshaw's shirt during the Fox Sports broadcast, then showed them working frantically to remove it using Tide.
Why: As the advent of digital media has made a new generation of viewers increasingly comfortable with skipping past ads (or watching fewer of them in real time), advertisers have pressed aggressively for new ways to tie their pitches more directly to the programs. In recent years, they have definitely succeeded.
Coca-Cola, “It's Beautiful” (2014)
Agency: Wieden + Kennedy
Appeared In: Super Bowl XLVIII
Game: Seattle Seahawks defeat Denver Broncos, 48 to 3.
What: Children sing “America the Beautiful”in seven different languages: English, Spanish. Keres, Tagalog, Hindi, Senegalese, French and Hebrew. “The ad provides a snapshot of the real lives of Americans representing diverse ethnicities, religions, races and families,” Coca-Cola explained upon the commercial's release, “all found in the United States.”
Why: The “Beautiful” ad was one of the earliest examples in a growing push by some of America's biggest and most influential advertisers recognizing their customers hail from a more diverse population than the one consuming their goods in say, 1955. Others sparked the trend as well – one ad that aired in the 2014 game for Cheerios depicted an interracial marriage. Both concepts drew hateful comments, but pointed to a larger truth: Advertisers need to appeal to all potential customers, not just those who have historically enjoyed a premium position. Since that time, the Super Bowl ad roster has been filled in part by sponsors eager to shed a light on social issues.
Anheuser-Busch, “Bud Bowl” (1989 to 1995, 1997)
Agency: D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles was behind the first effort
Appeared In: Super Bowl XXIII- Super Bowl XXIX, Super Bowl XXXI
What: Bottles of the brewer's flagship Budweiser took the field against bottles of Bud Light (Bud Ice and Bud Dry would appear as the series wore on) in a stop-motion-animation classic that sometimes was as heady a contest as the game itself.
Why: In 2015, “Bud Bowl” may be a hoary old joke, but in its time, it stood as an example of an advertiser figuring out a way to craft something much bigger than a handful of 30-second commercials. The fact that “Bud Bowl” had a plot and an ending kept viewers guessing as the actual football contest wore on. The faux gridiron contest prompted some people to gamble on its outcome. In 2018, Anheuser Busch is embracing the concept again, with a “trilogy” of Bud Light ads that end up in a rollicking finale that involves a “Bud Knight.”
CBS, “David Letterman and Surprise Guest Stars” (2007, 2010)
Agency: In-House
Appeared In: Super Bowl XLI, Super Bowl XLV
What: Letterman was never known for their eagerness to take part in promotional stunts devised by others during their wee-hours tenure on NBC and CBS. But in 2007, they got Oprah Winfrey to appear with them in a CBS Super Bowl promo. Winfrey had been the target of an odd, poorly received joke Letterman made when they hosted the 1995 Oscars broadcast. Three years later, Letterman topped himself, and really raised eyebrows: They persuaded rival Jay Leno, then under scrutiny for returning to their “Tonight Show” perch after NBC had an acrimonious split with then-host Conan O'Brien, to join the fun.
Why: TV-network promos are old-school affairs, offering a peek at a coming program while telling viewers about the time and date of air. Letterman's clever executions raised the bar, however, and Fox and NBC have followed their example in the years that have followed. CBS for years faced raised expectations that Letterman might take part once again (he did so in 2013). After taking a query from a reporter at Super Bowl publicity event about Letterman's intent for the coming game, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves acknowledged that anything involving the late-night comic was “a tall order.”
Uber is looking at adding benefits and insurance for drivers
At the Code Conference tonight, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi spoke about the company's relationship with drivers, autonomous driving, uberEATS having a $6 billion bookings run rate, taking over as CEO and flying taxis, obviously.
Just this week, San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera sent subpoenas to Uber and Lyft seeking information on driver pay, benefits and classification info. Uber wasn't available for comment at the time, but now it seems that the company is looking at ways to offer benefits and insurance to drivers. Specifically, Uber is looking at an economically-sound way to offer drivers a benefits and insurance package so that “this can be a safer way of living,” Khosrowshahi said.
And despite what former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in the past about needing to get rid of the driver, Khosrowshahi said they disagree.
“The face of Uber is the person sitting in the front seat,” Khosrowshahi said. They added that it usually is a man driving, but that they would “love to have more women sitting in the front seat” because it's a “great form of employment.”
Still, Uber is moving ahead with autonomous driving. That's in light of the fatal car accident in Tempe, Arizona involving one of Uber's autonomous vehicles.
“We will get back on the road over the summer,” Khosrowshahi said.
Uber also envisions licensing its technology — once it's safe enough — to third-parties and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Despite the high-profile lawsuit between Uber and Waymo over self-driving car technology, Khosrowshahi said he'd welcome Waymo to put its cars into its network. Regarding Uber's relationship with Waymo, Khosrowshahi said it's “getting better.”
In addition to Uber's core driver business and autonomous driving, it has several other things going on for it. One of those is uberEATS, which Khosrowshahi said has a $6 billion run rate, is growing 200 percent and is the biggest food delivery company in the world, with the exception of those in China.
Uber also recently acquired JUMP Bikes for about $200 million, launched UberRENT, announced a public transportation partnership with Masabi and is working on flying cars via its Elevate program.
Just like residential and buildings have gone three-dimensional, Khosrowshahi said, “you're going to have to build a third-dimension in terms of transportation.”
For Uber, Elevate is its “big bet” on that third-dimension of transportation, they said. The big plan with all of these modes of transportations — whether that's bike-sharing, ride-sharing, flight-sharing or whatnot — is to become a multi-modal transportation service.
“We want to be the Amazon for transportation,” Khosrowshahi said.
Earlier in the conversation, Khosrowshahi shed some light into how they had no idea he'd get the chief executive officer job at Uber. In fact, they said that while their wife thought they would get the job, they aren't as optimistic.
They also spoke about their relationship with Kalanick and how, early on, Khosrowshahi asked for space and Kalanick respected that.
“I consult with them the way I consult with the board,” Khosrowshahi said.
Moving forward, Khosrowshahi still has their eyes set on the second half of 2019 to go public.
“We're on track,” they said.
Uber has lost yet another executive to continue the exodus of departures at the transportation company, Automotive News reports. This time, it's Uber VP of Global Vehicle Programs Sherif Marakby, who helped launch Uber's self-driving program in Pittsburgh.
It's not clear why Marakby left but Uber told Auto News that it was not related to the lawsuit with Waymo. It's also not clear if they left as a result of the sexual harassment allegations, but something tells me that scandal probably didn't make them particularly pumped to stick around. Marakby joined Uber last April after working at Ford for 25 years.
In the past few months, a gazillion people have left Uber. Ok, a gazillion is a bit of an exaggeration, but Marakby's departure comes not too long after Uber lost its head of comms, president, head of AI Labs, VP of growth and SVP of engineering.
I've reached out to Uber and will update this story if I hear back.
WASHINGTON (AP) -

Kirstjen Nielsen was sworn on Friday as the next Homeland Security secretary.
In a statement, Nielsen said that it's their “greatest honor to serve” in the role. They said the country faces “a complex threat landscape that is constantly evolving” and that they will do their “utmost to ensure that the department meets the threats of today and tomorrow.”
Nielsen formerly served as deputy White House chief of staff and as former DHS Secretary John Kelly's No. 2 at the department.
Secretary Elaine Duke had been serving as acting secretary since President Trump tapped Kelly to be their chief of staff.
Facebook shares have fallen around five per cent after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users. Sonia Legg reports
Mashal Khan was a 23 year old student of Mass Communications at the Abul Wali Khan University, situated in the city of Mardan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. They were an intelligent, witty and peace loving young man, and a critic of hypocrital values, traditions and the political system.
On 13th of April they were shot by a violent mob and then beaten to death as the mob suspected that he, along with their friends, was running blasphemous pages on social media. Their other friend was saved by the law enforcement agencies, but Mashal Khan is dead. They were killed on the charge of an allegation that was never proved or established in any court of law, nor was they given a chance to prove their innocence.
The incident took place when a few individuals levelled an allegation on them and the mob itself decided that they should be punished to death. The video of the mob beating them to death went viral on the social media. The way they were beaten was so brutal and ugly that no human can watch the video without tears in their eyes. Even the people who lived in the Stone Age would not have committed this kind of inhumane torture on a fellow human being.
The brutal murder of Mashal Khan is actually that ugly face of our society which we do not want to see, because we know that somehow this ugly face of society contains the glimpses of each and every one among us. Mashal Khan is not the first one and surely not the last who will be killed in the name of God over the charge of blasphemy.
Electronic media in Pakistan, as usual, was initially silent on this incident, very minor coverage given and only a few seconds of news and short analysis by a few anchors were aired amid the wrath of the public. Usually, speaking on this issue is considered a taboo in Pakistan, and rating points (TRPS) of television channels can fall quickly even if they are showing or commenting on the brutality of the mob justice in blasphemy cases. Unfortunately the tragedy of our age is that those who are carrying the flags of journalism, intellectualism, writing are mostly prejudice and only think according to the faith interpreted by the State and Mullahs. This is the reason these type of incidents are not given any importance and instead blame is put on a few individuals for committing this kind of brutal act just to avoid the discussion on the real issue that is the cause of these barbaric acts.
A true intellectual is always free of any kind of prejudice or bias, and always searches for the truth, always willing to change their ideologies and concepts if proven wrong. Sadly most of our intellectuals are activists and rather than interpreting the social or political problem and structural reforms, they work for their own vested interests and agendas. This incident is actually proof that a society that creates minds and thoughts based on prejudice and hatred for other humans and nations on the basis of religion cast creed and encourages the concept of conquering the world with a sword, actually becomes a self destructive one.
The people who are involved in the murder of Mashal Khan or other similar brutal incidents like Kot Radha Kishan, Joseph Colony and Gujranwala are actually the by-product of the hatred agenda. Most people in our society are approving these kinds of acts by remaining silent, because they have been taught not to question anything pertaining to beliefs, be it a belief regarding religion, nationalism or tradition. So when educated people remain silent, and the progressive who speak against this kind of inhumane acts become victim of fundamentalist forces, the rest of the population in this scenario are being left to consume the ideology that is being fed to them by extremist mindsets and religious fundamentalists.
Pakistan has a law regarding blasphemy and whoever is found guilty is punishable to death. But this law is mostly used to settle personal scores or to suppress minorities. Most often, if a person is accused of blasphemy, they are not given a chance to prove their innocence and is lynched to death by a mob or fundamentalists. Even the high profile politicians Shahbaz Bhatti and Salmaan Taseer were not spared when they tried to speak on this issue and were killed. The murderers who killed them eventually became public heroes.
Now this raises a question that in the presence of law regarding blasphemy in the country, why do this kind of incidents happen again and again on a regular basis and why do the majority of people demand death for the person who is accused and guilty even before trying them in any court of law? To understand this we need to study the social structure, social fabric and narrative of the society. The state of Pakistan after its birth, in an effort to create a social structure that suited its interests actually tried to include or influence the social narrative with religious narrative. The idea of developing a social structure that was based on religious narrative went all wrong as it gave birth to a social structure based on hatred and intolerance. The blending of religious and collective self denial of the reality by teaching wrong history and distorted facts, neither created a pluralistic and tolerant social structure, nor a desired agreed religious social structure or narrative was created.
It is very easy to understand that in any society, there are different communities of people whose beliefs, ideologies and concepts of life are entirely different from each other. This is the reason that modern states do not try to create a social fabric based on religious narrative. In fact in the modern social structures, states do not have anything to do with the beliefs of the people living in society. A social structure is always created to accommodate each and every single citizen living in society so a society can be formed that is diverse in nature, peaceful and where every single human in the fabric can live freely according to their ideology of life.
Contrary to that, our state has never been able to understand its role in the modern concept of creating a social structure or a fabric. Instead of trying to adhere to the ideology of Jinnah, the founding father of the nation, that was actually meant purely to be a pluralistic and secular society, the state inserted religious narrative into the social structure to form a society that should be driven by religion in order to survive.
To achieve this goal the state apparatus were used to such a large extent that even the text books of social studies and science were used to promote the religious and self proclaimed theories about how the whole world conspires against us all the time, thus creating a society that constantly lives in the state of delusion and paranoia and that thinks it is the only defender of God's message and hates other humans and nations instead of compassion, lacking a human loving attribute in it. This resulted in giving birth to the conservatives and religious minded intellectuals, writers and journalists backed by mullahs and the state, thus creating a narrative according to which critical thinking is a crime, questioning the interpretation of religion is a blasphemy, other religions and nations are inferior to us and instead of reasoning and acquiring knowledge, we can conquer the world through weapons or jihad.
Until and unless the state creates a new social order and new social narrative based purely on the principles of modern social sciences and unless this current narrative is not changed entirely, kids like Mashal Khan will continue to die at the hands of fanatics. The collective social suffocation, inability to live in reality and unwillingness to accept the changed civilisation combined with personal frustration will keep providing a free hand to the extremists to exploit the blasphemy law to kill people who are not ready to buy the interpretation of narratives by the state and mullahs.
Mashal Khan and kids like them present a picture of peace and are actually a glimpse of the colours and joys of life. Their criticism on traditions, values, the political system or questioning the interpretation of religion by mullahs is not blasphemy, it is in fact an indication that the new generation has started to negate the propaganda and narrative built on distorted facts and self interpreted beliefs. They have started thinking objectively and rationally. These kids are our future and a hope towards forming a peaceful and brighter pluralistic society. On the other hand people spreading hatred in the name of religion cast or creed are the obstacles towards the path of making this society progressive.
The state should play its role by discouraging extremist mindsets and denouncing support towards these or mullahs, and should try to promote the culture of debate on these sensitive issues. As a citizen each and every one among us needs to play our role to create a tolerant society by teaching our kids not to hate anyone and by not glorifying wars. Otherwise one day we will lose our kids like the parents of Mashal Khan lost theirs in the name of blasphemy, and will carry the unbearable burden of losing our young children on our shoulders for the rest of our lives.
LAHORE - The Punjab Food Authority, in collaboration with the Lahore College for Women University (LCWU), arranged a seminar on breastfeeding and causes of breast cancer on Friday.
PFA Director General Noorul Amin Mengal, senior officials, LCWU VC Prof Dr Uzma Qureshi, Prof of Pathology from Allama Iqbal Medical College Dr Fauzia Ashraf, P&D member Dr Fatima and Prof Sara also joined in.
Mengal explained the importance of breastfeeding and effects of formula milk on infants and mothers. “Chances of breast cancer in women feeding their babies are lesser than those who don't,” they said, adding that the PFA imposed a ban on marketing and free sampling of infant formula milk in hospitals after consultation with the Formula Milk Association. They said the PFA was in action to monitor quality of food for people, especially children. They added that 700 PFA teams under the supervision of FSOs and 2,000 Food Technologists were working actively to secure growth and nutrition of people in Punjab. The DG credited Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PFA team for getting approved 16 laws from the Punjab Assembly.
The authority banned all carbonated drinks in educational institutions, they said, adding that the DG said companies selling products by misleading people through advertisement campaigns were committing ‘White Collar Crime'. Dr Ahsan Waheed Rathore called for creating awareness about breastfeeding to get away with maternity issues. Breastfeeding brings down the infant death chance to 40 percent, they added. LWMC VC has appreciated the efforts of PFA and urged students for creating awareness about breastfeeding and other food products.

OUR STAFF REPORTER
“I Hope You Dance,” recorded by Lee Ann Womack with Sons of the Desert, and written by Tia Sillers and Mark D. Sanders, was one of 2000's most successful singles in several genres, and is one of only a handful of songs in the past two decades that can truly be considered a classic. A life-affirming song with an uplifting, timeless message, it's based on the narration of a mother expressing the wish that their children will step out and embrace life, and take a chance on love and faith.
When asked about each writer's contribution to the song, Sillers diplomatically, and appropriately, doesn't claim their input was any greater than their co-writer's. But they do remember the origin of the line that opens the third verse – which is only half as long as the first two verses – I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean. “I'm always kind of sheepish about that, about who did what, because I consider myself a real collaborator,” they said. “But the whole thing started when I was at the beach by myself, and I was standing at the ocean, feeling so tiny and inconsequential. And then I went into the writing appointment with Mark with this list of ‘I hope,' like ‘I hope this' and ‘I hope that'.”
It's hard to imagine what would have happened with the song if Womack hadn't been the one to record it, but following the old songwriting adage that a great song always finds a home, it seems likely that someone would have had some success with it. “A number of people wanted it, and I'm really not sure Lee Ann wanted to record it,” Sillers recalled. “But [Womack's producer] Mark Wright told her, ‘You need to record it.' They booked a session for them and asked us if they could have first crack at it. It just kept growing, and Mark was such a visionary with their production and arrangement. Lee Ann is always about lyrics first and did such a great job, and I don't want to say it went in a pop direction, but it did end up being more pop. But to me it was really more of a heartfelt folk song.”
Sillers and Sanders are the rare songwriters whose careers, and songs, have changed the way many look at Nashville songwriting and popular music. They went on to author two successful books inspired by the positive message of “I Hope You Dance,” and the song even has its own IHYD Facebook and Twitter pages. Already a success both before and after this song, Sanders has had hundreds of cuts and more than a dozen number one country hits. Sillers, some two decades younger than Sanders, followed “I Hope You Dance” with more well-known hits of their own, including another co-write with Sanders, Alan Jackson's “That'll Be All Right.”
Womack has made some fine records since, but “I Hope You Dance” was something that every artist and writer dream of: a classic career record that was a success worldwide, and a song whose lyric genuinely touched people. Sillers themselves has continued to sing the song they call “a gift” at various public appearances, performing until recently with their husband Mark Selby, the noted Nashville guitarist and songwriter who sadly lost their battle with cancer in September.
Read the lyrics.
“Much of the visual dynamism associated with Fassbinder and Scorsese must be credited also to Ballhaus. There are the complicated but elegant compositions in Fassbinder, for example, where closeups, reaction shots and the simultaneous movement of actors are often incorporated into a single frame without recourse to cutting … There are the accelerated zooms and dolly shots in Scorsese's films, where the camera rushes toward a face or an object to afford it special emphasis.”
NEW DELHI - India's Supreme Court jailed the anointed next leader of Tamil Nadu for four years for corruption Tuesday, heightening the turmoil in a state still reeling from the death of its long-time matriarch.
VK Sasikala was ordered to surrender to prison authorities after judges quashed their acquittal in a $10 million "disproportionate assets" case also involving their mentor, the late chief minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram.
There was no immediate reaction from Sasikala who was not present at the apex court in New Delhi and has been holed up in a resort close to Tamil Nadu's capital Chennai since last week. But the verdict brought a juddering halt to the 59-year-old's meteoric rise as they were on the cusp of becoming the leader of one of India's most populous and prosperous states.
The court ordered they immediately hand themselves in to begin serving their sentence, which automatically bars them from holding public office for a decade, as well as fining their 100 million rupees ($1.5 million).
The panel of judges also sentenced their nephew and niece to four years after the Karnataka High Court acquitted all of them in 2015 of any wrongdoing.
"The magnitude of the nefarious gains as demonstrated by the revelations in the case are, to say the least, startling," Justice PC Ghosh and Justice A Roy wrote in their verdict.
The ruling also said there was "incriminating evidence" against Jayalalithaa, a former film star who died last December after three stints as chief minister.
Sasikala had been anointed as Jayalalithaa's successor by the state's dominant All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and was likely to be sworn in later this week.
But they have been involved in a bitter battle with acting chief minister, O Panneerselvam, who has been trying to block them ascent.
Although there was no immediate response to Tuesday's verdict from Sasikala herself, their party issued a statement saying Panneerselvam and 19 other senior AIADMK rebels had been sacked.
Edappady Palaniswamy, a Sasikala loyalist, was appointed AIADMK leader in place of Sasikala but Panneerselvam is likely to stay on as chief minister while the infighting continues.
"Let us bury the hatchets and stay united for the good of the party and continue the fine governance of Amma," Panneerselvam told reporters after the verdict, using Jayalalithaa's nickname.
While the 2014 conviction sparked mass protests, Sasikala does not command anything like the same level of loyalty as Jayalalithaa and there are no immediate signs of demonstrations.
Few party workers were at the party headquarters and the only people outside their residence were political rivals who celebrated the verdict by bursting firecrackers and distributing sweets.
"This verdict shows that individuals in public life should not indulge in corruption," opposition leader M K Stalin told reporters.
Sasikala has taken refuge since last week in a luxury resort alongside several dozen AIADMK state legislators, keeping a close eye on them over fears that Panneerselvam's camp might poach them before them investiture.
The corruption case dates back to late 1990s when Jayalalithaa and Sasikala were accused of profiting from the chief minister's office and amassing wealth beyond their income.
They were jointly accused of owning several bungalows, luxury cars, tea estates, eight tons of silver, nearly 30 kilogrammes (66 pounds) of gold and thousands of saris which could be not accounted for.
The court put the overall value of the assets acquired illegally at 660 million rupees, equivalent to around $10 million.
Sasikala was running a video parlour and Jayalalithaa was a budding politician when the two met, which marked the beginning of a decades-long friendship dogged by corruption allegations.
Sasikala's meteoric rise mirrored that of Jayalalithaa who came to power following the death of their own mentor and regular movie co-star M. G. Ramachandran in 1987.
But unlike Jayalalithaa, who inspired a devotion that verged on the religious, Sasikala is seen as lacking charisma and a solid power base.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Ride-services company Uber is facing a divided board of directors and angry shareholders after investor Benchmark Capital filed a lawsuit against the company's ousted chief executive, Travis Kalanick, dealing another blow to the firm as it struggles to recover from a series of scandals and hire a new leader.
On Friday morning, three Uber investors asked Benchmark to divest its shares and step down from Uber Technologies Inc's board, according to an email published by news website Axios and confirmed by Reuters.
Also on Friday, members of the board of directors sent an email to Uber staff expressing dismay over the Benchmark lawsuit, according to a copy of the note obtained by Reuters.
"The Board of Directors is disappointed that a disagreement between shareholders has resulted in litigation," the directors wrote. "The Board has urged both parties to resolve the matter cooperatively and quickly, and the Board is taking steps to facilitate that process."
Benchmark, in its lawsuit filed on Thursday, is seeking to force Kalanick off the board, and accuses them of concealing a range of misdeeds and scheming to retain power at the company even after they were forced to resign as chief executive in June.
Benchmark was among the Uber investors in June who pressed Kalanick to step down after a string of setbacks.
Investors Shervin Pishevar of Sherpa Capital, Ron Burkle of Yucaipa Companies and Adam Leber, an angel investor who works for music company Maverick, on Friday wrote an email to shareholders and board members calling for Benchmark to remove itself from the company board and divest enough of its shares so that it would no longer have the right to appoint other board seats.
"We have investors ready to acquire these shares as soon as we receive communication from Benchmark that they are willing to withdraw their lawsuit and sell a minimum of 75 percent of their holdings," the email said, according to Axios.
Reuters confirmed the email with a source close to one of the investors. The three investors and Benchmark could not be reached for comment.
The division and hostility emerging among Uber investors and directors opens a new front in a highly unusual public battle for Silicon Valley. It is rare for a venture firm to sue the central figure of a valuable portfolio company, and equally unexpected for investors to make a counter-move to push out a fellow investor backing the same company.
Pishevar, Burkle and Leber -- who are not members of the board of directors -- said Benchmark's lawsuit harms Uber's valuation, interferes with fundraising efforts and impedes the company's search for a new CEO to replace Kalanick.
Benchmark's tactics are "ethically dubious and, critically, value-destructive rather than value enhancing," the investors wrote in the email, according to Axios.
The email from the board of directions was signed by Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Ryan Graves, Arianna Huffington, Wan Ling Martello and David Trujillo. Missing were the signatures of Kalanick and Benchmark board member Matt Cohler. It assured staff that there were "several outstanding candidates" for the CEO job.
One Uber investor told Reuters that Kalanick's continued role at the company has complicated the CEO search and scared off some good candidates.
PanARMENIAN.Net - Confirming the market appeal of France's Cedric Klapisch after their “The Spanish Apartment” trilogy, their latest film, drama comedy “Back to Burgundy”, will have been sold significantly across the world by the end of the Berlin Festival.
More than 20 territories have already been secured, more will be closed in the next few days, Variety said.
“Back to Burgundy's” powerful rollout comes as a promo of “Gauguin,” starring “Black Swan's” Vincent Cassel, on which the Cohen Media Group has U.S. rights, was presented to buyers at Berlin. Directed by Edouard Deluc (“Welcome to Argentina”), and penned by Deluc, Etienne Comar,(“Django”), Tomas Lilti (“Irreplaceable”) and Sarah Kaminsky (“Raid: Special Unit”), “Gauguin's” first major territory deals look set to go down in the next few days.
Written by Klapisch and regular co-scribe Santiago Amigorena and screened to buyers at Berlin's European Film Market, “Back to Burgundy” turns on long-gone brother Jean who returns home to France's Burgundy as they and their siblings inherit their family vineyard. Saving it, they discover their roots.
Klapisch's comedy drama stars three young French actors who have burst into the scene in the last decade to awards and significant roles: Pio Marmaï (“The First Day of the Rest of Your Life,” “Living on Love Alone”), Ana Girardot (“Next Time I'll Aim for the Heart”) and François Civil (“Elles”).
Studiocanal itself will distribute “Back To Burgundy” in its home territories of France, Germany, U.K. and Australia/New Zealand, a practice on its key foreign-language titles.
Spain (Avalon), Benelux (Cineart) and the Middle East (Salim Rania) were licensed at Berlin.
Poland, Canada and Italy will close by the end of the Festival, said Anne Cherel, Studiocanal SVP, international film sales.
Produced by Bruno Levy for Klapisch's Ce Qui Me Meut label, “Back to Burgundy” has also secured distribution in Japan with Kino Films, a frequent Studiocanal client, South Korean arthouse distributor-exhibitor T-cast, Taiwan (Movie Cloud), Singapore (Shaw) and Indonesia.
French films can be a hard sell in South East Asia. A “prestige mainstream title,” however, “Back to Burgundy” is “quintessentially French, about wine, family, and roots. It is what people love about France, and reveals the strong relationships between the vineyard workers and the wine itself,” said Cherel.
Pre-sales also took in Switzerland's Frenetic, Spentzos in Greece, Portugal's Lusomundo, Cinecolombia and Mexico's Cinemas Nueva Era. Further buyers are the Czech Republic's Cinemart, Acme for the Baltics, Lev in Israel and Brazil's Esfera Filmes.
“‘Back to Burgundy” was bought by big distributors. It was perceived as a broad commercial French film also because Cedric Klapisch is well-known after the success of ‘Spanish Apartment,' ‘Russian Dolls' and ‘Chinese Puzzle,'” Cherel said.
Shot over the four seasons, “Back to Burgundy” is also a film about natural cycles, whether generational renewal in a family or those of a vineyard. To establish change throughout the year, Klapisch hired a photographer to take a picture of a tree every day at 3 pm for one year. How the three siblings change is the heart of the film.
Cynthia Nixon, actor and New York gubernatorial candidate
Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon is running for governor of New York.
The 51-year-old actor launched their candidacy on Monday. She'll be running as a Democrat, setting up a primary battle against the state's current governor, Andrew Cuomo.
In a video announcing their candidacy, Nixon cited income inequality, health care, mass incarceration, and New York City's deteriorating subway system as some of the issues they plan to focus on. “I love New York. I've never wanted to live anywhere else. But something has to change. We want our government to work again,” they say in the video. She's also launched a campaign website, which you can find here.
Nixon play Miranda Hobbes on all six seasons of HBO's Sex and the City, a role for which they won the 2004 Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy. She's also the recipient of a Tony Award (for their role in The Little Foxes) and a Grammy Award (for their audio book narration of Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth).

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP)  The best formula for success against the New England Patriots is to keep Tom Brady on the sideline and harass them when hes on the field.
Thats not a news flash. But the good news for Eagles fans and everyone roots against Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots in Sundays Super Bowl is that Philadelphia has the ingredients to do it.
The Eagles (15-3) have a multidimensional, ball-control offense capable of chewing the clock and forcing No. 12 to be a spectator.
Jay Ajayi, former Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount and Corey Clement led the NFLs third-best rushing offense and the Eagles were first in time of possession. (Continued below.)

You have to stay patient and diligent there, Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. Thats something weve been able to do all season long. Its something we stay committed to.
This isnt an old-school, ground-and-pound offense, either.
The Eagles have a versatile passing attack with several receivers who create matchup problems. Carson Wentz threw for 3,296 yards and 33 touchdown passes before they tore their ACL in Week 14 and Nick Foles has eight TD passes, including playoffs.
Foles proved in the NFC championship game they can make quick-strike plays with three passes of 40-plus yards against the leagues top-ranked defense. Two of those were TD tosses of 53 yards to Alshon Jeffery and 41 yards to Torrey Smith.
Pro Bowl tight end Zach Ertz and slot receiver Nelson Agholor are other options. Tight end Trey Burton, who also lines up at fullback in certain short-yardage situations, had five TD catches this season.
You cant just stop one guy, Patriots safety Devin McCourty said. You cant go out there and say, if we just limit Jeffery or if we just limit Ertz that wont matter. They have a lot of different guys out there that can beat you.
Foles has been adept at making the right calls on run-pass option plays, making it even more difficult for defenses facing Philadelphia.
Its hard because you have to defend every inch of the field, McCourty said. Each guy has to do their job on the play. We cant have guys doing things that dont fit the defense.
On the opposite side of the ball, defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has an aggressive unit. Nobody runs on Philadelphias defense. It was No. 1 against the run and didnt allow a 100-yard rusher until Ezekiel Elliott had 103 in Week 17 against backups and third-stringers.
The Patriots (15-3) rely mainly on Bradys arm, even though Dion Lewis had 896 yards rushing and James White was a Super Bowl hero last year. But Brady cant throw if they dont have time and the Eagles have a dominant front four led by Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham.
The line often generates enough pressure that Schwartz doesnt have to blitz much and theres enough depth with Chris Long, Vinny Curry, Tim Jernigan and Beau Allen that guys stay fresh in the fourth quarter.
Safety Malcolm Jenkins is a physical presence in the secondary and cornerbacks Ronald Darby and Jalen Mills are solid cover guys.
They have a great defense, Brady said. Its as good any weve faced all year. They have a great scheme that mixes in well with their coverages.
If the game comes down to a field goal, rookie kicker Jake Elliott has a strong leg. They kicked a 61-yarder at the end of regulation to beat the Giants in Week 3 and is 6 of 7 from beyond 50 yards.
The Eagles shouldnt be tight and theyre not intimidated by the Patriots. Theyre a loose, relaxed group that has embraced their underdog role throughout the playoffs and overcame injuries to several key players.
Greatest quarterback of all time, but that doesnt mean that hes unbeatable, Jenkins said of Brady. Were not worried. We match up well.

Police were called to Kalakaua Avenue near Lewers Street around 1:15 a.m. for a possible stabbing.
HPD found a man wounded.
Emergency medical services officials confirm they are a 21-year-old man.
They were taken to Queen's Medical Center in serious condition with wounds to their body, head and thigh. EMS says the type of weapon used is unknown.
An investigation is underway, many suspects are being questioned.
"He would do anything for the team," said former sevens teammate Sean Duke, who scored 124 tries for Canada. "The amount that guy works is insane. And he's always been that way.
"He's one of the toughest players I've ever played with. Probably the toughest. They will put their head anywhere. He's not afraid of anything."
Duke noted how Moonlight would always be the one sprinting toward an opposition try-scorer, busting a gut to deny an easy conversion from under the posts.
Moonlight played in a Canadian-record 318 matches on the World Series, 14th on the all-time list, and scored 580 points.
Moonlight was the longtime Canadian skipper but shared the captaincy recently with Nate Hirayama and Harry Jones after missing time with the team to take a firefighting course in Texas.
Former Canadian seven coach Liam Middleton called Moonlight "the full package."
"John's a phenomenal person, first and foremost," Middleton, a native of Zimbabwe who has coached around the world, said in 2015. "He's one of the most exceptional people I've met in my rugby career. Fantastic leader, a guy of high great integrity. Huge work rate."
After becoming a carded athlete, Moonlight honed their body in the weight room. Watching them run, it was hard not to marvel at the muscles in their legs.
Moonlight does not expect to continue playing rugby at club level but hopes to stay involved in the sport, helping young talent develop. And while they have experienced both the highs and lows of Canadian rugby, they are optimistic about the future of the sport here.
"I see there's some good people, especially in the sevens program, trying to do good things," Moonlight said. "If we get the (talent) development right, I think Rugby Canada is going to get themselves back on track."
Their next goal is to compete in an Ironman triathlon.
Quiet by nature, Moonlight led by example, according to Duke.
"That's the best way to do it," Duke said. "You can't talk the talk without walking the walk. And they definitely walked the walk."
Moonlight, who also won 23 caps for the 15s team including three games at the 2015 World Cup, counts the 2017 Singapore win as one of their career highlights.
"(It was) huge for me," they said. "One of the things I always said in my career was I wanted to lift a cup before I ended (playing)."
They also pointed to the roar that greeted the Canadian team when it ran out in the inaugural Canada Sevens tournament at Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium in 2016.
"To be able to represent our country in our country and have so many people cheering for us. That's one of those moments I'll never forget. It was so loud in there."
Moonlight repaid the favour, bulling their way over for the decisive try with no time remaining to complete a 19-17 comeback win over France in the Bowl final.
And they recalled winning the inaugural Pan American Games rugby sevens gold in Guadalajara in 2011 — sharing a postgame celebratory pizza in the stadium next to Hirayama and Duke, whose fresh stitches were still leaking blood.
"One of my favourite memories," said Moonlight.
In 2015, when Canada won Pan Am gold in Toronto, they were named Canadian men's sevens player of the year for the fourth straight year.
Moonlight took up the sport in Grade 9 as a back. But after Googling the different positions, they decided the hard-nosed world of a flanker sounded more their style.
They also played hockey, football and volleyball, but started focusing on rugby when Paul Connelly, who taught and coached at Uxbridge Secondary School, told them they were good enough to play for the Canadian under-19 side.
Moonlight made the Ontario team — they had been cut the year before — and earned a spot on the Canadian under-19 squad the next year. Their cousin David Moonlight, a former Canadian international and sevens player of the year, also encouraged him.
John Moonlight, who has lived in Victoria since 2007, joins fellow Canadian rugby internationals Morgan Williams, Chauncey O'Toole and Derek Daypuck in becoming a firefighter.
Moonlight sees similarities between rugby and firefighting in terms of the team approach to both.
"We talk about having trust in each other on the field all the time and trusting that the guy beside you will do their job when you need them to. Well it's the same thing in firefighting. You're always working in pairs and you're always working for the team ... You're successful together, much like on the (playing) field."

NEW YORK, NY (February 14, 2017) — The New York State Distillers Guild, an association of more than 60 producers across New York State, is excited to introduce its new website – NYDISTILLED.COM. This extensive and easy-to-navigate site is a one-stop source of information about craft spirits and their production in New York State, one of the leaders in the burgeoning craft beverages movement.
NYDISTILLED.COM provides information about the history of distilleries in New York State, how to best savor the unique flavors of these artisan beverages and an accessible description of how craft spirits are made. A listing of member distilleries, many of which offer tours, tastings and a chance to speak with the distillers themselves, can be sorted by type of spirits and region. Suggested distillery trails make it easy to explore distilleries around the state. The site also aims to boost awareness of New York State craft spirits and its member distilleries among distributors and purveyors in the U.S. and international liquor industry.
“We are experiencing a true Renaissance of distilling in New York”,” said Daric Schlesselman of the New York Distillers Guild? “In 2013, leading New York craft distillers formed the NY State Distillers Guild to promote and advocate for the distilling industry and set a high bar for quality. We believe that this new website will provide a continually growing resource for the distillers, consumers and the spirits industry as a whole.”
Craft spirits, like craft beer and other artisan beverages, are generally produced with an emphasis on local ingredients and quality over quantity. The process of producing these small batch beverages has its roots in centuries old traditions. New York State distillers produce a diverse variety vodka, gin, rye, whiskey, rum, bitters, vermouth and liquors. A hallmark of New York State distillers is their individuality and passion for using locally harvested grains, pears, cherries, honey, maple syrup, a wide range of apple varieties, and other local ingredients.
The first known distillery in New York State dates back to 1640. By the early 20th century, New York distilleries produced gallons of whiskey, apple brandy and other spirits, in part to help preserve and capitalize on the prodigious amounts of produce being harvested across the state. Prohibition forced New York to go dry. Then, starting in 2004, seeing the growth in demand for locavore, artisan foods and beverages, the State began working with distillers to create regulations enabling small-scale distilleries to thrive.
Demand for artisan spirits is certainly on the rise. According to a 2016 study, produced by the American Craft Spirits Association in conjunction with The International Wine and Spirits Research (IWSR), the U.S. craft spirits market has grown over 27 percent in both volume and sales between 2010 and 2015 to an estimated $2.4 billion in retail sales. Many retailers and wholesalers surveyed for the study drew parallels to the craft beer industry, which currently has 11% of the U.S. market share for beer, and they reported that the craft spirits has the potential to perform in line with or better than craft beer. In New York State, which ranks among the top five craft spirit-producing states in the nation, the craft spirits industry has grown over 500% since 2011 and there are now more than 150 distilleries throughout its 11 regions.

(Reuters) - Indian shares rose on Monday, tracking Asian peers that climbed on positive U.S. payrolls and Chinese trade data, with investors continuing to bet on a possible win for the country's ruling party in a key state election.

Markets are hoping for a big success by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and their ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in assembly elections in Gujarat, with tens of thousands voting in the first stage of the polls on Saturday.
A victory would help boost the government's re-election prospects during general elections in 2019 and reinforce its reform agenda, although analysts said it was already being priced into markets, making the margin of a win crucial to further boost shares.
Three recent big polls have predicted a victory for Modi's party, but with a greatly reduced majority.
“If BJP wins, it's definitely good for the markets, but unless they win by a landslide like they did in Uttar Pradesh and surprise everyone, markets (NSE index) should remain rangebound in the 10,000-10,500 levels,” said R.K. Gupta, managing director at Taurus Asset Management Company.
The broader NSE Nifty was up 0.30 percent at 10,296.35 as of 0619 GMT, while the benchmark BSE Sensex was 0.35 percent higher at 33,365.35.
The gains also tracked a 0.4 percent increase in Asia shares ex-Japan after strong U.S payrolls data and better-than-expected Chinese trade data on Friday.
The PSU bank index rose as much as 1.7 percent, with constituent State Bank of India up as much as 2 percent.
Private sector lenders Axis Bank and HDFC Bank were up about 0.5 percent each.
Property developer Unitech Ltd rose as much as 19.2 percent after a court allowed the government to take over management control of the debt-laden company on Friday.
(Adds Ford statement)
BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Ford Motor's China joint venture will recall more than half a million vehicles due to brake-related issues, an additional headache for the U.S. carmaker as it faces rising challenges in the world's top auto market.
The recall, which will start from Feb. 25, is linked to issues with materials used for brake hoses that could affect braking distances, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said on its website.
The watchdog said Changan Ford, Ford's passenger car joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co, would recall 371,371 Mondeo models and 195,796 Edge SUVs.
Ford confirmed in a statement the recall was to “correct a concern related to brake hoses on certain Edge and New Mondeo vehicles”.
The recall work would be conducted free of charge for customers and should take around two hours, the carmaker said.
The recall follows the sudden resignation of Ford's China chief, Jason Luo, this week after only five months at the helm, a departure that throws a spanner in the automaker's attempts to turn around a sales slump in the market.
Its China sales slid 6 percent last year versus a 3 percent rise for the market overall. Luo was meant to help Ford improve ties with local partners like Changan Automobile.
Toyota Motor Corp, which announced a 24.5 percent jump in its January China sales on Friday, will also recall 181,797 vehicles, the quality watchdog said in a separate statement. (Reporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk and Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Amrutha Gayathri)
TULSA, Okla. (AP)  A Tulsa teenager accused of fatally shooting a man and raping an 81-year-old woman had been released from jail just three days before the attacks.
Deonte James Green, 16, was charged Friday as an adult with 17 counts connected to series of crimes on Sunday, including first-degree murder, rape, kidnapping and robbery. They remain jailed in Tulsa County.
The Tulsa World reported Green had previously been booked into the Tulsa Jail on Sept. 22 for several property crimes, including second-degree burglary, based on claims they broke into a storage unit, stole a bike and pulled down surveillance cameras.
Juvenile proceedings are typically closed to the public. The newspaper obtained a copy of the teen's earlier arrest report because it was filed for consideration as a youthful offender case, which allows the state to levy harsher penalties for serious offenses.

The Tulsa County District Attorney's Office declined youthful offender prosecution in the previous case in favor of sending it to the juvenile bureau.
District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said they were "frustrated by the tragedy of these crimes."
"I understand and respect the need for confidentiality in juvenile court proceedings, but it makes my job difficult when I am called upon to explain such matters to the public," Kunzweiler said.
Police say Green broke into a couple's south Tulsa residence before noon Sunday and forced them to drive them to an ATM and withdraw money for him. They then forced the couple to return with them to their residence, sexually assaulted the woman and robbed them of cash and a handgun, said Tulsa Police Sgt. Dave Walker.
After leaving the residence on foot, police said they approached a woman and their two daughters with a gun as they left their house and forced them back inside. The woman's husband was inside, and Green fought with the man and shot them in front of their children, Walker said.
Desktop Metal has had no issues raising interest (or funding) in the manufacturing world. The metal 3D printing company announced today that it's score another $65 million in backing, bringing its total to $277 million. This latest round was led by Ford, and also includes addition money from previous backer, Future Fund.
Ford's interest in company that 3D prints metal is pretty clear, of course, and the automotive giant is taking things a step further by adding its Chief Technology Officer Ken Washington to Desktop Metal's Board of Directors.
The tech isn't quite ready to start printing out cars on Ford's production line just yet, but the companies told CNBC that they're working toward that seeming inevitability. Desktop Metal already produces a printer built specifically for factory production.
Slated for release in 2019, the company's Production system is a push to make its technology scalable on the production line. The core of Desktop Metal's tech binds powders into polymers and cook them in a furnace. The company claims its tech is 100-times faster and 20-times cheaper than existing 3D printing technologies.
Ford joins an already impressive roster of names that have invested in the startup, including Google Ventures (GV), GE Ventures, New Enterprise Associates (NEA) and Lowe's. BMW iVentures, has also seen the potential in tech — the automotive giant's VC wing invested in Desktop Metal this time last year, with an eye toward the future, stating that the company “is shaping the way cars will be imagined, designed and manufactured.”
A Korean national has been arrested at Suvarnabhumi airport and charged with stealing a purse containing cash worth about 10,000 baht which had been forgotten by a fellow traveler at a passenger terminal shop.

Histoplasmosis, better known as “cave disease,” usually found in the central and southern U.S., has turned up in Israel, The Jerusalem Post reported on Monday.
Doctors at Rambam Medical Center in Haifa recently finished treating a woman with histoplasmosis, the first case ever diagnosed in the Middle East.
The disease, caused by a fungus found in soil – typically from bird droppings or bat guano – usually passes without treatment. But sometimes the infection damages the lungs and requires anti-fungal medications. If left untreated it can be fatal. It is not contagious.
“A few months ago, we received a biopsy taken from a woman's pharynx in the course of a diagnosis in another hospital,” recalled Dr. Ami Neuberger, director of the tropical diseases clinic.
“Such lesions are thought here to usually be malignant, but this case was different; I did not believe the result at the beginning,” Neuberger said. “Specific tests in the microbiological laboratory confirmed the diagnosis. I immediately asked the patient, who lives in the Galil, ‘Where did you go?' To my surprise, it turned out that the woman never left the country.”
They had been suffering for months from general weakness, weight loss and a lump in the throat that caused hoarseness and impaired their speech. Treatment with an anti-fungal drug eliminated the symptoms within a few weeks.
Staff at Rambam were puzzled as to how they contracted the disease, but eventually suspicion fell on the Yodfat cave in the Galil.
“It is very close to the area where the woman lives. We tried to find the fungus in the Yodfat cave and in the patient's neighborhood, but no fungus was found in any of the samples,” said Neuberger. “Perhaps a number of caves were dug to excavate the foundations. This, of course, is not a fact but a hypothesis. I hope this is the first and last case in Israel.”
Spiro aims to sell CRM software to businesses that have been avoiding traditional CRM products.
CEO Adam Honig told me that they and their co-founders Andy Levi (CTO) and Justin Kao (vice president of growth) originally set out to build artificial intelligence products that could assist with CRM (i.e., the software that salespeople use to track their customers and deals). But then they started hearing from companies that weren't using any CRM at all.
So the team ended up broadening its approach, building a full platform for what Honig described as “proactive CRM.” In other words, it accomplishes the job of CRM, but with enough automation that most of the tedious data entry goes away.
A lot of that comes from Spiro's integration with your email inbox — it can automatically create and update customer profiles based on who you're emailing. It can also make recommendations, for example about when you should be following up with a lead.
In fact, you can do most of your interaction with Spiro from email. Kao showed me how you can send an email to Spiro asking it to “Remind me to call Anthony on Friday,” and then, when the time comes, you'll get that reminder over email. They also showed me how a supervisor could ask “What did Andrew do this week?” and get a report on emails sent, meetings scheduled and opportunities created.
“Our goal is to make CRM go away,” Kao said. “We really want to take this recommendation engine to the next level.”
Spiro says it already works with more than 500 customers. According to Honig, many of them come from traditional industries like manufacturing.
The startup is announcing that it has raised $3 million in seed funding led by Geekdom Fund, with participation by MassVentures, Hyperplane Venture Capital and New Harbour Partners.
“We often get asked, ‘Why does the world need a new CRM platform?'” Honig said. “We believe — and the Geekdom guys agree with us — that there are just people and companies that CRM has not reached.”

ROCHESTER, NY (April 17, 2017) – Black Button Distilling, Rochester NY's first and finest grain to glass craft distillery, and one of the top 5 Craft Distilleries in the USA according to USA Today's 10 Best 2016 Readers' Choice poll, is proud to announce the induction of Jason Barrett, President and Head Distiller, and Jeff Fairbrother, Production Distiller, as a member in the London based international gin industry member body, the Gin Guild. Barrett and Fairbrother are two of only five current members of the Gin Guild in the United States.
As the youngest American Master Distiller and youngest Gin Guild recognized Warden Rectifier, Barrett has achieved the highest ranking in the spirits industry — on two continents — before turning 30. The Gin Guild is a subsidiary of the Worshipful Company of Distillers, one of London's traditional livery bodies, which was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1638. The historical role of the Worshipful Company of Distillers was to hold key responsibilities for the control and regulation of early gin distillers. Today, the Gin Guild is a spirits industry body, charged with protecting the gin trade and culture around the world. The Gin Guild promotes and encourages commitment to excellence in gin distillation and industry custodianship of the spirit category. Brand owners and producers are eligible to join in the corporate rank of Warden Rectifier.
“With less than 200 members worldwide and only five in the United States, it is huge honor to be recognized in this way,” said Barrett, who, along with Fairbrother, was sworn in at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. in early April, after being invited to join the Gin Guild by the first US Gin Warden Rectifier, Stephen Gould, of Golden Moon Distillery in Colorado.
Gould recommended Barrett and Fairbrother specifically because of the innovative products like Lilac Gin and Citrus Forward Gin produced by Black Button Distilling.
“This is a very rare and distinguished honor, one that in the spirits industry is akin to being knighted,” said Barrett.
At the ceremony, the new members were “installed” as Gin Guild members in the presence of Christopher Hayman, the Chairman of the Gin Guild (whose family have been involved in gin distilling since 1863), and its Director General, Nicholas Cook. The new members swore the Guild oath to protect the spirit's quality and production around the world, while symbolically holding juniper berries (the key botanical in Gin).
“These are exciting times for gin with bartender and consumer interest in the flexibility of the spirit driven by both a general renaissance in gin consumption and many new products, often with interesting contemporary twists on the traditional standard gin styles,” said Cook.
To date, there are only five Gin Guild members in the US; two of them are at Rochester's own Black Button Distilling. In order to be inducted, members must prove their knowledge of gin and their commitment to the craft of producing and protecting gin, and provide industry references.
“Distilling is a passion of mine,” said Barrett. “I'm devoted to continuous education and innovation in the spirits industry. That's why I went to five different distilling schools before opening Black Button Distilling, and it's why I run a distilling school here – for the love of the spirit,” they said, noting that Black Button Distilling also installed a 50 gallon test still to aid in the production of new craft sprits.
“With our new equipment, we look forward to continuing to work on new and innovative craft spirits and to continue to protect the gin trade as a reputable craft here in the United States and abroad,” they said.
About Black Button Distilling
Black Button Distilling is the first grain-to-glass craft distillery in Rochester, NY since prohibition. Founded in 2012 and housed in a 9,000-square-foot space near Rochester's historic Public Market, Black Button Distilling specializes in farm to still products, using unique and all-natural ingredients from local farms to craft 2,400 bottles of award-winning spirits each week, distributed in 12 states.

I MAKE PEOPLE SMILE WITH THE LENS CAP ON
March is Women's History Month, a time to celebrate accomplishments and encourage women to reach for new heights.
Back in 1934 one woman showed that their gender didn't necessarily make them the weaker sex.
Mildred Didrikson was born in Texas in 1911. They were quite athletic and could hit a baseball further than the boys could – earning them the nickname “Babe,” after the New York Yankees hero.
On this date – March 20, 1934 – with their athletic chops confirmed by their performance in the 1932 Olympics, Babe Didrikson took the mound for the Philadelphia Phillies during an exhibition game against the Brooklyn Dodgers.
They started the game, pitching one inning. Didrikson walked one batter, but did not allow a hit!
In 1930, after excelling in basketball and track at Beaumont High School, Didrikson was hired by the Employers Casualty Company of Dallas to play for its Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball team.
About two decades earlier, another great athlete – Jim Thorpe – was stripped of their Olympic medals because they had played a few games of semi-pro baseball, thereby losing their amateur status.
Didrikson wasn't about to let that happen to them To make sure they kept their amateur status, the company hired them as a “secretary” and then put a basketball in their hand. They also competed for the company in track and field.
At the 1932 AAU championships, which was then the only real qualifier for the Olympics, Didrikson won five of the eight events they entered, setting world records in the javelin throw, 80-meter hurdles, high jump and baseball throw.
During the 1932 Olympics, in Los Angeles, Didrikson won two gold medals. They might have won more – except for sexism.
Didrikson had qualified to compete in five events, but women were restricted to three events at the Olympics. A day after setting the world record in the javelin throw, they set a new world record in the 80-meter hurdles. They were held to a silver medal in the high jump in spite of tying with the declared winner – because the judges did not approve of their head-first style.
Following their Olympic triumph Didrikson toured the country, playing basketball and baseball – and even playing the harmonica on the vaudeville stage.
In 1933 they began the greatest phase of their illustrious career – as a professional golfer. They completely dominated the women's circuit.
But sexism persisted to plague them
They were often urged to “pretty themselves up” for the cameras, but refused. Once, when asked at the National Celebrities Tournament how a girl could hit a ball so far, they replied “just take off your girdle and swing.”
Despite far outclassing the women's golfing circuit, Didrikson's efforts to compete on the men's tour were consistently rebuffed.
In 1950 Didrikson was named the greatest female athlete of the first half of the 20th century. (The top male athlete was Thorpe.)
Babe Didrikson died of cancer in 1956.

SpaceX has concluded its investigation into the cause of an accident on a Cape Canaveral launchpad during which one of its rockets exploded, the company reported Monday. The investigation, conducted in partnership with federal safety and space agencies including the FAA and NASA, involved closely reviewing all recorded materials and data, as well as running tests at SpaceX's facilities in Hawthorne, CA and McGregor, TX.
The results of the investigation point to the issue that caused a Falcon 9 rocket to explode in September during pre-launch fueling. SpaceX's investigation team found that there was a failure of a pressure vessel found inside a tank used to store liquid oxygen for the rocket's second stage fuel burn. The problem in this case was that oxygen built up between the liner and overwrap of the vessel, which was probably made worse by loading helium so cold it turned the pooled oxygen from liquid to solid. SpaceX says it will enact both short- and long-term fixes to address these problems and is confident they will ensure a safe fueling process both immediately and in the future.
Now that the investigation is concluded, SpaceX hopes to get back to flying on January 8, the target date for its launch with client Iridium satellites. SpaceX will use a Falcon 9 to deliver a payload of 10 Iridium satellites to orbit, which the telecommunications network is using to create a voice and data network. The satellites from Iridium are already loaded into the Falcon 9's transport capsule.
If SpaceX does indeed meet their launch window and successfully return to active mission status, their turnaround time between the September accident and getting back to launches will be unprecedented, and would go a long way toward returning full confidence to the other clients on its launch manifest.
In their State of the Union address, President Donald Trump seemed intent on burying any chance of enacting legislation to protect the dreamers. Instead of reaching out to Democrats to fashion a readily achievable compromise, the president injected more ethno-nationalist venom into a debate they already have done much to poison.
Eleven million immigrants are living in this country without legal documentation, but the vast majority of them are otherwise law-abiding. In fact, they are overwhelmingly employed, long-term residents who contribute to their communities in all manner of ways. That is especially true of the dreamers, young people brought to this country as children by their parents. Very few Americans want to see the dreamers rounded up and deported, so youd think a president would search for common ground to prepare the way for their eventual path to citizenship.
Instead, Trump chose in the most inflammatory way possible to associate immigrants with a horrific crime committed by a vicious gang. Rather than reminding Americans of their common roots as immigrants and stressing that immigration is the cornerstone of the American story, Trump vilified them. They would have Americans believe that compassionate treatment for unaccompanied minors who cross the border, often fleeing violence and poverty, or family-based immigration is somehow akin to acquiescing in the homicidal nihilism of MS-13.
Trump could have sought a constructive way forward. They could have urged Congress to forge a straightforward deal  a shield for the dreamers in return for border security. Some Democrats would be reluctant to give the president their beautiful wall; some Republicans would balk at amnesty for dreamers. But if Trump embraced the deal, so would Congress.

Instead, they attempted to expropriate the grief of four of their guests in the gallery: parents still mourning the brutal 2016 murder of their teenage daughters on Long Island. That wont earn them the moral high ground, but it may well deepen the nations divisions and further complicate the fate of nearly 2 million young immigrants about whom Trump has said, I love these kids.
Maybe the saddest moment of the speech came when Trump tried to knock the dreamers off their sympathetic perch with the cleverly contemptuous line, Americans are dreamers, too. Yes, of course, Americans are dreamers. But they should finish the thought. For most dreamers, the United States is the only country they know. Dreamers are U.S. soldiers, high school valedictorians, the young couple living next door. Yes, Americans are dreamers  and dreamers are Americans. If only we had a president who understood as much.

Related Coverage Police warn lockboxes on cars can be targets for thieves
Car thefts and break-ins are some of the top crimes in Hawaii, turning thousands of people every year into victims.
According to the Honolulu Police Department's CrimeMapping feature, just in the last week, there were more than 100 cases of vehicles being broken into or stolen on Oahu, and most of them were in town.
This is part one of our two-part series looking at the vehicles stolen the most in Hawaii, and how you can protect yourself and your family from becoming victims.
Honolulu police say last year, 2,877 vehicles were stolen on Oahu. Thieves tried to steal another 456 vehicles, but didn't get away with them.
It's a lot, but at least it's down from years past.
Wendell Takata is a retired HPD officer and worked as a detective for the auto theft detail.  They are now president of Western States Auto Theft Investigators Association – Hawaii Chapter.
“Back in 2006, it was over 8,000 cars a year that were stolen on Oahu alone,” Takata said.
“If you find out that your car was just stolen, call 911 immediately and what the officers tend to do is send another officer to your home, if you're reporting it away from the scene, to make sure your residence is okay,” they added.
As for what types of vehicles are being stolen, the top stolen vehicles in Hawaii compared to the nation are:
That's according to the latest numbers from the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Most of them are older vehicles.
There are a lot of similarities as far as makes and models of the vehicles targeted by thieves. So why are older Accords and Civics at the top?
Takata says it's “because they have less anti-theft deterrent systems, and it's a favorite for a lot of thieves because it's easy to get into and start.”
Not to mention, they're among the most popular cars in Hawaii and on the mainland. HPD tells us, parts for certain vehicles may also be in higher demand.
Vehicle thefts by make Honda*: 831

“It depends on the individual. A lot of the thieves have favorites,” Takata said. “Work trucks and commercial vehicles have been a favorite for some of these thieves, because of the tools and equipment they have inside.”
Thanks to advances in technology, it's harder for crooks to steal cars these days.
“One of the most common ones these days is within the key, there's a microchip inside of here, and if this key is not present at the time of the car being started, the car will either not start or immediately shut off, so the days of hotwiring are over now,” said Jon Wenger from Subaru of Hawaii.
Wenger adds that many cars now have a “find my car” type of feature, “so what auto manufacturers are doing is adding a cellular device inside of a car, so it's implanted in the car and thieves can't find it, but they're able to track the vehicle if it's stolen.”
Of the 2,877 vehicles stolen last year, HPD tells us 2,173 were recovered. That's a 75 percent recovery rate — better than the mainland — thanks to the fact that we're an island state.
Some stolen vehicles are used to commit other crimes. Others are simply used as transportation, and others are stripped.
“Even some newer cars are ending up in (chop) shops,” Takata said.
Despite the amount of vehicles stolen, only 130 suspects were charged with driving a stolen vehicle last year. It's a class C felony punishable by up to five years in prison.
“It's difficult to prosecute,” said Honolulu prosecuting attorney Keith Kaneshiro, “and the reason why it's difficult is if someone steals a car and someone says another person authorized the person to take the car, it's difficult for us to prove the intent and knowledge it was stolen.
“Even when they're convicted, they're not really sentenced to prison. They give them probation. We have multiple auto theft defendants who are convicted but are on probation,” Kaneshiro added.
When asked what could be done to bring down auto thefts, Kaneshiro said “mandatory sentences. You put these guys who are stealing vehicles in prison, and you keep them in prison.”
What can you do to prevent your car from being stolen?
“Don't leave the keys in the car for one,” Takata advised. “Park in a well-lighted area. If you have an alarm system, use the alarm system, even if you're gone for a minute or so.”
This applies even when your car is parked in your open garage or driveway.
“People have a false sense of security when they're at home,” Takata said. “They tend to leave it unlocked, or even leave the keys in the ignition while at home.”
HPD says in 603 of the auto theft cases from last year, a key was used to drive away the vehicle, and 97 of the keys were stolen from lock boxes.
Bottom line: Make sure you do what you can to minimize the opportunity for thieves.
In Part 2, we'll look into car break-ins — where they're happening the most and how many happened last year. It's an even bigger problem than cars being stolen.
Tips from the Honolulu Police Department:
Secure your keys. Don't leave your key in the ignition, or with the engine running — not even for a moment or even if you're near your vehicle. Always assume someone is watching, especially if you think you can hide your key.
Secure your vehicle. Lock your doors and close your windows.
Secure your property. Remove any property from inside the vehicle if possible. Even an empty bag, package, or something that has little value could invite a thief to break into your vehicle to find out if there is anything inside of that empty container. If you must leave property inside your trunk or other area of your vehicle, make sure you do so away from where you eventually park.
Consider additional layers of protection. You can install audible and visible devices, like alarms and locking devices. There are also ways to help immobilize your vehicle, such as smart keys or devices that interrupt unauthorized starting, even if someone was to get a hold of your key. There are also commercially available anti-theft systems and tracking systems.

ROCHESTER >> Tai Odiase had 19 points, on 8-for-8 shooting, and three blocks, Godwin Boahen hit four 3-pointers and finished with 16 points and Illinois-Chicago beat Oakland 79-73 on Friday night for its fifth win in a row.
Marcus Ottey added 15 points and Tarkus Ferguson had 13 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for UIC (13-11, 8-3 Horizon League). The Flames have eight conference wins for the first time since finishing the 2007-08 season 9-9 in Horizon League play.
Odiase had a dunk and two layups during a 6-2 spurt that made it 17-14 and UIC led the rest of the way. Ferguson converted a 3-point play to spark a 10-2 run that pushed the lead to 11 points before Boahens 3-pointer made it 40-30 at the break. Nick Daniels hit a 3 that pulled Oakland (14-10, 6-5) within two points with two minutes to play, but Ottey made two free throws and Odiase hit a jumper to make it 76-69 and UIC made 4 of 6 free throws in the final 32 seconds to seal it.
Martez Walker had 21 points and Jalen Hayes scored 15 for Oakland. Kendrick Nunn added 20, but shot 3 of 22 from the field, including 1 of 10 from 3-point range.

Taylor Jones scored a team-high 16 points going 3-for-6 from 3-point range and 5-of-10 from the field while Leah Somerfield just missed a double-double with 12 points and nine rebounds as Oakland fell 86-66 to visiting Cleveland State on Saturday. Nikita Telesford also scored a season-high 12 points with six rebounds.
It was a tale of two halves as Oakland took a 39-34 lead into the locker room shooting 41 percent from the field. However, CSU switched to a zone defense to open the third quarter which limited the Golden Grizzlies offense to just 27 second half points and less than 20 percent shooting.
Oakland opens a two-game road swing at Northern Kentucky on Thursday.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister won further support from the European Union and NATO on Monday over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent as they denounced Moscow's denials of involvement as “increasingly absurd”.
Johnson discussed the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and their daughter Yulia at a session of EU foreign ministers, which they addressed, and in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg after statements of solidarity last week by a host of Western governments.
“Our NATO allies have shown such undivided support,” Johnson told reporters after meeting Stoltenberg.
All 28 EU foreign ministers issued a joint statement on the attack, expressing “unqualified solidarity”.
“The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible,” the statement said.
Russia, including its president, Vladimir Putin, denies any involvement.
Johnson said they saw a “classic Russian strategy” as they arrived for the EU meeting, a day after Putin was re-elected for another six-year term as president.
“They're not fooling anybody anymore,” Johnson said.
“There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected in recent years by some kind of malign or disruptive Russian behaviour.”

Stoltenberg echoed that position, saying: “Russia will continue to seek to divide us.”
Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom meanwhile accused the Russian Foreign Ministry of deliberately sowing confusion by suggesting the nerve agent used in the attack on the Skripals might have come from Sweden.
“This is just ridiculous and totally unfounded,” Wallstrom said. “I think they are trying to divert the real issues here.”

Moscow on Saturday announced the expulsion of 23 British diplomats in a tit-for-tat response to Britain's decision last week to expel the same number of Russian diplomats from London.
On Sunday, Johnson accused Russia of stockpiling the deadly Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok used to poison the Skripals, a charge Moscow denies.
The couple were found unconscious on a bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4 and remain in a critical condition in hospital.

Asked what support Britain had requested from the EU and NATO to counter Russia, Johnson said they were seeking to intensify work on a range of strategies, such as defences against Russian attacks on computer networks, challenging disinformation campaigns and acting against criminal financial networks.
“There are things we can and must do together,” Johnson said, adding that Britain was “going after the money that has been illicitly or corruptly obtained,” without giving details.
While there was no immediate prospect of further sanctions on Russia, British Prime Minister Theresa May will have an opportunity to present their case for any such measures at an EU summit on Thursday, or call for others to expel diplomats.
“We need to put pressure on Russia to take part in a real enquiry about the attack,” Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told reporters.
LONDON-Conjoined twins have gotten the best present for their first birthday, the gift of life.
Little Erin and Abby Delaney, who are turning one-year-old in July, were successfully separated in an 11-hour surgery. The girls were joined at the top of their heads, a condition called craniopagus. It is the rarest type of conjoined twins.
Erin and Abby, who are from North Carolina, were in excellent care. Their surgery took place on June 7 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which has done 23 separations.
An official for the hospital said the surgery was carefully orchestrated, with monitors and equipment marked with purple and green tape indicating which was being used for which little baby.
Each detail had to be mapped out as it took a team of around 30 health care professionals in a variety of fields to complete the surgery.
The team was co-led by neurosurgeon Gregory Heuer, MD, PhD, and plastic surgeon Jesse Taylor, MD.
The team included physicians, nurses and other medical staff from neurosurgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery, and anesthesiology.
The lucky little girls are recovering in the intensive care unit.
Parents Heather and Riley never gave up on their daughters. They found out they would be conjoined just 11 weeks into Heather's pregnancy and immediately started looking into specialized pre-natal care, according to a statement released by the hospital. Conjoined twins are extremely rare. The statistics for a fighting chance at life are incredibly slim, around half of the twins are still born, and about a third who do make it into the world die within their first 24-hours.
KARACHI - Karachi Transport Action Committee President Mohammad Ashraf Banglori has asked City Mayor Wasim Akhtar to streamline Karachi's sewerage system.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, they said, "Sewage is overflowing in MA Jinnah Road, Jehangir Road, Purana Golimar, Lee Market, Garden Road and Ranshore Lane areas, causing problems for the people of these localities.”
“Sewage accumulates on these roads, causing traffic jams and unhygienic conditions. Pedestrians and bikers are in trouble because of this ugly condition of roads and streets,” they said. Heaps of solid waste in different areas of the city and sewage have become a big issue, which needs to be addressed on a priority basis, they said.

One of the many films to world premiere at this year's Sundance Film Festival was Un Traductor. The film takes place in Cuba and it's about a Russian Literature professor (Rodrigo Santoro) at the University of Havana that's ordered to work as a translator for child victims of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster when they are sent to Cuba for medical treatment. The film is actually based on the true story of the father of the two directors of the film, Rodrigo Barriuso and Sebastián Barriuso. What's interesting about the film is you get to see a different side of Cuba than you're used to. You see what happened when the Berlin Wall started to fall and the repercussions on the other side of the world. Un Traductor also stars Maricel Álvarez, Yoandra Suárez, Nikita Semenov, Jorge Carlos Pérez Herrera, Genadijs Dolganovs, Milda Gecaite, Laura Mia, Ravelo Hernández, and Aleksandra Maslennikova.
Shortly after seeing the film Rodrigo Santoro, Rodrigo Barriuso and Sebastián Barriuso came into the Collider Studio at Sundance. They talked about how the project came together, how Santoro was cast, what the film is about, casting the kids, if it was tough getting financing, and so much more. In addition, Rodrigo Santoro talked about the challenges of speaking multiple languages in the film and Westworld season 2.
Check out what they had to say in the player above and below is exactly what they talked about followed by the synopsis.
Finally, a huge thank you to everyone at Kia and The Future Party for helping to make these interviews happen at the Kia Supper Suite and offering up transportation in the all new Kia Stinger high performance Sportback for our guests. We'd also like to thank Altec Lansing, Kunde Wines, Blue Moon Brewing, and Topo Chico for their support.
Rodrigo Santoro, Rodrigo Barriuso and Sebastián Barriuso:
They talk about what the film about.
Rodrigo and Sebastián Barriuso talk about how they decided to make the film and how the material is based on their dad's story.
Rodrigo Santoro talks about how they got involved in the project and the challenges of playing this role with the different languages.
When did Rodrigo feel like they got comfortable on set speaking the different languages?
How did they cast the kids and what was it like working with them?
How tough was it to get financing?
What's the last great movie they saw?
Did Rodrigo Santoro have any idea how popular Westworld would be when they signed on to be part of the HBO show?
How early did they know about the different timelines when making the show?

BEIJING - China warned Monday that nobody would win in a "trade war" with the United States as President Donald Trump prepared to launch an investigation into Chinese intellectual property practices.
Trump was due on Monday to sign a memorandum directing US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine whether any Chinese laws, policies or practices discriminate against or harm American innovators and technology companies.
The investigation could lead to sanctions against Beijing.
Asked about the US move, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said any member of the World Trade Organisation must respect WTO rules.
"Fighting a trade war has no future. There will be no winner and everybody will lose," Hua said at a regular news briefing.
"I believe China and the US should continue to work together for the stable and sound development of China-US economic and trade relations," they said.
US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, bluntly accused China on Saturday of "stealing our intellectual property" -- long a concern of Western companies seeking a share of the enormous Chinese market.
The looming investigation follows high tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has accused China of failing to rein in the nuclear ambitions of its ally North Korea. The US officials, however, said the North Korean issue and the investigation into China's trade practices are not linked.
China on Monday announced that it would ban from Tuesday imports of iron, iron ore and seafood from North Korea as it follows through on new UN sanctions approved earlier this month.
"I want to say that China-US cooperation should be based on mutual respect and mutual trust," Hua said.
"The Korean peninsula nuclear issue and the China-US trade issue are totally different and it's not appropriate to use one issue as a tool to keep pressure on the other issue."

There's nothing more annoying than getting to the supermarket with your kids to find all the parent and child spaces are taken.
Cue a trek from the other side of the car park with the rugrats in tow.
So one woman decided to take drastic action when they saw a man - on their own - getting into their car in one of these spaces outside a branch of Sainsbury's.
And they were so pleased with their plan, they decided to tell everyone about it on Mumsnet .
The woman explained: "I just blocked in a man in a parent and child space in sainsbury (sic) car park.
(Image: Getty)
"Cheered myself right up. Watched them load bags into their car and into the seats of their two high backed boosters.
"Told them politely it was a parent and child space and they lied and said their wife was in the shop still with their children.
"He looked so shifty. So I said I'd wait for them to come out (was parked behind their car waiting for them to finish loading).
"He stormed off with their trolley and then had to admit on their return that there was no wife/children with them and they wanted to leave."
(Image: AFP)
But their pride was short-lived as not everyone thought it was a good plan.
While some mums congratulated them on the prank, others were furious.
One wrote: "So you behaved like a t**t to try and match him? What a great example to set your kids!"
Another put it more simply, commenting: "You're a d**k."
One said: "How anyone can get this worked up about a child and parent parking space is beyond me, disabled parking I could understand but this is just daft.
poll loading Was the mum right to block the man in the parking space? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Yes, they shouldn't have been there No, it's none of their business
"Your (sic) the one that looks like a d**k in this tbh (to be honest)."
NerrSnerr wrote: "Really? Why do you even care? If this really happened you're an idiot."
They did have some support. TellMeIAmBonkers came to the rescue, writing: "I'm team OP! Well done. I was in a car park the other day and had to watch some smug t**t in a mercedes (sic) convertible pull into the last remaining P&C space right in front of me.
"I then had to park miles away from the entrance in a space that barely let me open the doors and squeeze the DCs through the tiny gap. Getting them back into their child seats was a blast.
"Thanks, mercedes guy!"

Michel MOUTOT - The doctrine of nuclear deterrence, put to the test in the standoff between Washington and Pyongyang, dates to the Cold War when the world's two superpowers seemed hellbent on “mutually assured destruction”.
The arms race between the United States and the then Soviet Union saw a proliferation of nuclear warheads as well as their vectors - missiles, planes and submarines.
On the eve of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, the Soviet arsenal boasted some 37,000 warheads, compared with nearly 22,000 warheads in the United States, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS).
Today, thanks to a series of multi-lateral and bilateral treaties, those numbers have dropped to around 7,000 and 4,480 respectively - still more than enough to assure nuclear suicide for both sides.
“The nuclear weapon, invented 70 years ago, has shown itself to be an effective means of preventing war since there has been no conflict between major powers since then,” said researcher Bruno Tertrais of the Paris-based Foundation for Strategic Research.
“There has never been open conflict between nuclear powers and no country with nuclear weapons has ever been invaded,” they added in a report.
Similarly, “no country protected by the nuclear umbrella has ever suffered a massive military attack,” they wrote, referring to NATO's 29 member states. But critics of the deterrence doctrine reject these arguments, saying it is a theory that cannot be tested.
Moreover, they argue that the interdependence of the world's economies and the influence of international institutions have been the overriding guarantors of peace between the big powers since World War II.
Two hair-raising tests
The policy has faced two serious tests - the 1962 Cuban missile crisis and a hair-trigger confrontation between India and Pakistan 40 years later.
In 1962, at the height of the Cold War, an American spy plane detected Soviet medium-range ballistic missile installations on the territory of Soviet ally Cuba just miles off the Florida coast. The Soviet move followed the deployment of American ballistic missiles in Italy and Turkey.
The US president John F. Kennedy responded with a military blockade of Cuba and placed US strategic forces on maximum alert dubbed DEFCON 2, the level preceding full-out nuclear war.
B-52 bombers were on continuous airborne patrol and dozens of inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were on ready alert.
Soviet ships laden with nuclear missiles turned back in exchange for a secret agreement by Washington to remove its missiles from Turkey. Washington also promised not to invade Cuba.
The crisis prompted the BAS to move its “Doomsday Clock” to two minutes before midnight, the closest the world has ever been to global nuclear catastrophe in its estimation.
Four decades later India and Pakistan came to the brink of nuclear war as their decades-old dispute over Kashmir reached fever pitch, with nearly a million soldiers massed on either side of the territory's disputed border. Both became a nuclear power in 1998.
After Pakistan's then president Pervez Musharraf said they were prepared to resort to nuclear weapons against India, India's defence minister told the International Herald Tribune that “he should realise that India can survive a nuclear attack, but Pakistan cannot.”
The two sides began a series of tit-for-tat missile tests before agreeing, under US pressure, to de-escalate tensions.
They reached a ceasefire in November 2003 and started a dialogue the following January.
International relations expert Daniel Vernet, former editor-in-chief of the influential French daily Le Monde, said the crisis involving North Korea illustrates the dangers of nuclear proliferation.
“Dissuasion worked as long as there were few actors and they were considered rational,” they said in a recent op-ed. “Their proliferation increases the possibility for misunderstandings, false interpretations of another's intentions, or unbalanced judgement in autocratic regimes.”
The BAS set its Doomsday Clock to two and a half minutes to midnight in January this year partly as a result of a Trump's “comments over North Korea, Russia and nuclear weapons.”
AWS today announced that its Neptune graph database, which made its debut during the platform's annual re:Invent conference last Novemberr, is now generally available. The launch of Neptune was one of the dozens of announcements the company made during its annual developer event, so you can be forgiven if you missed it.
Neptune supports graph APIs for both TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, making it compatible with a wide variety of applications. AWS notes that it built the service to recover from failures within 30 seconds and promises 99.99 percent availability.
“As the world has become more connected, applications that navigate large, connected datasets are increasingly more critical for customers,” said Raju Gulabani, Vice President, Databases, Analytics, and Machine Learning at AWS. “We are delighted to give customers a high-performance graph database service that enables developers to query billions of relationships in milliseconds using standard APIs, making it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected data sets.”
Standard use cases for Neptune are social networking applications, recommendation engines, fraud detection tools, and networking applications that need to map the complex topology of an enterprise's infrastructure.
Neptune already has a couple of high-profile users, including Samsung, AstraZeneca, Intuit, Siemens, Person, Thomson Reuters and Amazon's own Alexa team. “Amazon Neptune is a key part of the toolkit we use to continually expand Alexa's knowledge graph for our tens of millions of Alexa customers—it's just Day 1 and we're excited to continue our work with the AWS team to deliver even better experiences for our customers,” said David Hardcastle, Director of Amazon Alexa in today's announcement.
The service is now available in AWS's US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) regions, with others coming online in the future.
MUMBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India has raised the price at which the government will buy new- season common rice variety from domestic farmers by 13 percent, said Home Minister Rajnath Singh, as the state looks to woo farmers ahead of general elections due next year.

India, one of the world's key producers of an array of farm commodities, announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government said in its February budget that it would buy crops at 1.5 times the cost of production, a major shift after keeping the so-called minimum support price in low single digits over the past three years.
Analysts and economists have warned the move could help push up inflation, add to the fiscal deficit and prompt India's central bank to raise interest rates more steeply than expected.
INDRANIL PAN, GROUP ECONOMIST, IDFC BANK, MUMBAI
“It is too early to evaluate the implication of the minimum support price (MSP) hikes on inflation. We will have to wait till October-November to see the reality in terms of markets prices vs MSP to gauge inflationary impact. The announcement of MSP increase is unlikely to change the reaction function of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) immediately, as core inflation, oil and currency will be key factors to drive the timing and extent of rate hikes. We expect the RBI to hike rates in August as well as in October due to the high core inflation and oil prices.”
FORAM PAREKH, FUNDAMENTAL ANALYST - EQUITY, INDIABULLS VENTURES, MUMBAI
“The hikes are very much in line with expectations. If the market side increases prices more than the MSPs, then it might lead to an inflationary situation. If farmers do get the benefit of the MSP hike, then the NBFC and automobile sectors would benefit due to rural income rising. Over the years, MSP has been revised by the government, but I don't think the quoted price has reached the farmers. So it's a wait-and-watch situation. We would only come to know if the farmers are actually getting it in the month of October.
“Due to the rise in MSPs, the government would have to bear expenses of about 330 billion rupees ($4.81 billion). It contributes not more than 0.2 pct-0.3 pct of the GDP. I think it is a very minimal number and should not impact the economy as a whole. The major dent the economy would face is from rising crude prices.”
ADITI NAYAR, PRINCIPAL ECONOMIST, ICRA LTD, MUMBAI
“Without further details on whether the procurement of crops would be widened from the current set, or if another mechanism would be adopted to ensure that farmers receive prices at par with MSPs for their produce, it remains difficult to ascertain the impact of higher MSPs on inflation and fiscal deficit.
“Some of the items that have seen the biggest increases in MSPs for the ongoing kharif season, such as jowar, bajra, ragi and moong, have a small weight in the WPI and CPI indices. This may help to contain the inflationary impact, if higher MSPs translate to higher market prices.
“Nevertheless, it is difficult to envision a scenario in which the recently announced hike in MSPs actually translates into higher realizations for farmers, without an increase in prices for the end-consumers or costs for the central and state governments through higher procurement costs and subsidy bill.”
UPASNA BHARDWAJ, SENIOR ECONOMIST, KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK, MUMBAI
“Most of the wholesale prices are higher than the mininum support price. How that translates into market prices will be a function of how exactly the implementation of these MSPs would be. At this point, it is difficult to gauge exact impact on inflation. It seems to be inflationary, but magnitude is uncertain. This move was something that was necessary, but needs to be implemented in the right way to ensure they get what they need, to be able to cover up for the costs.”
TIRTHANKAR PATNAIK, INDIA STRATEGIST, MIZUHO BANK, MUMBAI
“The 200 rupees per quintal hike for paddy is very reasonable, so not likely to rattle markets. If the number was anything beyond 200 rupees, there could have been some market implication. The hike will add about a 25 basis point number to headline inflation, which the government would be okay with. I think this hike should not have too much of a negative impact.
“The hike in ragi crop was higher than expected. A larger hike in paddy would have moved the needle. So, this is a negative, but not an unexpected negative from a fiscal balance perspective. It is quite clear it was a question between keeping the farmer community happy in the pre-election year and also not to upset the credit rating agencies. With this hike for paddy, they have ensured the tightrope balance is fine.
“We may see these populist measures coming from the state governments instead of federal government. I'll not be surprised if we see similar sops from the state government simply because the current GST collection, crude at over $70 does not leave much room for fiscal balancing by the central government.”
SHUBHADA RAO, CHIEF ECONOMIST, YES BANK, MUMBAI
“The median hike from the MSPs is 25 percent compared with 3-4 percent in the last three years. The impact from these MSP hikes will be 35 basis points to headline inflation in the current fiscal year, and another 35 bps in the next. The MSP hike is broadly along expected lines, and may not accentuate concerns for the RBI on this account.
“However, a larger concern emanates from continued elevated prices of crude oil. We maintain a risk of one more hike of 25 bps by October. We don't see any material risk on fiscal as the impact is at a manageable level of 0.1 percent of GDP. In every preceding election year, the MSP hikes have been high, like it was 40 percent in 2009, 27 percent in 2013 and 25 percent in 2018. This will help in boosting farmer income and potentially offset the adverse impact of high oil prices on growth.”
A PRASANNA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP LTD, MUMBAI
“The newly announced minimum support prices for Kharif crops mark a steep rise in prices. We estimate that the rise in support prices of cereals and pulses in FY 2019 will be nearly 25 percent, equivalent to the cumulative increase seen over the last five years. On a CPI-weighted basis, the increase amounts to 90 basis points, and thus, we expect at least 50 bps upside risk to forward-looking inflation estimate. Should the government rely on large-scale procurement of crops to implement the prices, then the fiscal cost could be around 0.3 percent of GDP, which might be shared by the central and state governments.
“As far as monetary policy is concerned, we expect the Monetary Policy Committee to take note of the upside risk due to direct impact of higher MSPs, fiscal cost and second-round effects. In tandem with further rise in oil prices and rupee depreciation since the June policy, this development should cement the case for another hike. We continue to expect that hike to be delivered in the October meeting.”

LAHORE - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) selection committee Friday announced 15-member squad for the five-match One-Day International (ODI) series against Sri Lanka to be played from October 13 to 23 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The final squad was announced by the cricket board after consultation with head coach Mickey Arthur and captain Sarfraz Ahmed. "The Champions Trophy team has been retained except Azhar Ali, who has been rested for the ODI series to gain full fitness," said chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq.
Imam's selection has evoked criticism in the media and cricket circles in Pakistan as the selection committee has preferred this 21-year-old batsman over Sami Aslam, who scored two centuries in the 50-over Pakistan Cup and boasts of a better domestic record. They have also scored eight centuries in list A game and their 2,522 runs in 43 games have come at a strike-rate of 87.29 and an average of 48.50 while Imam has scored 848 runs at 49.88 last season, with three hundreds including a double-century for Habib Bank Limited (HBL). They have played 13 list A game this year, averaging 31.84 with three half-centuries.
"Imam-ul-Haq has been selected in the squad keeping their performance in the domestic circuit and to give a chance to a youngster in the home conditions," chief selector Inzamam said about their nephew.
The selection committee also left out their former ODI captain Azhar Ali citing that they need to manage their workload. It understood that they are yet to fully recover from a knee injury and has been taking injection to be free of pain during this Test series.
The first one-day international will be played on October 13 at Dubai International Cricket Stadium while the fifth and last match of the series will be played on October 23 at Sharjah Cricket Stadium.
ODI SQUAD: Ahmed Shehzad, Fakhar Zaman, M Hafeez, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed (capt), Imad Wasim, Shahdab Khan, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Ali, M Amir, Ruman Raees, Junaid Khan, Haris Sohail, Imam-ul-Haq.

Nearly 200 protestors gathered at MacArthur Square Saturday afternoon to rally for the legalization of marijuana across Wisconsin. This was the 8th annual Cannabis march in Milwaukee, and many speakers and protesters discussed the medical and criminal justice benefits to legalization.
Currently in Wisconsin, a second offense for possession of marijuana is a Class I felony and is punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 3.5 years, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. A 2013 ACLU Report found that, “Marijuana use is roughly equal among Blacks and whites, yet Blacks are 3.73 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.” A 2015 Public Policy Forum Report Brief titled Marijuana in Milwaukee, found that although African Americans make up approximately 26 percent of Milwaukee County's population, they accounted for 86 percent of those found guilty of a second or subsequent marijuana possession offense in 2013 and 2014.
The Southeastern Wisconsin Chapter of NORML was present at the event, educating people about marijuana. Jaz Morgan of NORML came to the rally to discuss the many benefits of legalizing marijuana.
“I'm here for criminal law reform…African Americans are in jail because of petty marijuana charges,” said Morgan. “I came out to spread the word and to feel and be assured that people agree with legalization.”
Wisconsin Rep. David Bowen came to the rally to speak about the benefits of legalization. They introduced a bill in February that would essentially prohibit employers from demanding drug screenings that test for THC, the chemical responsible for the majority of marijuana's effects.
“We need to outlaw drug testing for THC,” said Bowen in a speech. “It's about criminalizing people…about people who need a hand up, not a hand out.”
Bowen said they want people to engage with their elected officials to discuss this issue.
“There are jobs and employers all over the state that continue to test positive for a substance that is harmless,” said Bowen. “It's an ongoing process to make sure you are engaging elected officials even outside the election cycle.”
Jafar Banda, the founder of Community Uprise of UW-Milwaukee, says they believe legalization will help reduce the prison population by 50 percent. They also said it will help end racial profiling.
“We know that black men are racially profiled, and we know they aren't the only ones smoking marijuana,” said Banda.
Rick Banks, an organizer with Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, also came to the rally to show their support for legalization. They said that the new taxes created from legalization will help build better schools and roads across Wisconsin.
“It's not the worst thing that's legal,” said Banks. “Alcohol and prescription medicine do much more damage than marijuana.”

Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, on Monday, December 11, presented a budget of N1.046 trillion for the 2018 fiscal year to the state House of Assembly.
In the appropriation bill tagged ‘Budget of Progress and Development,' 67 percent was earmarked for capital expenditure, while 33 percent was allotted for recurrent expenditure.
Ambode, while addressing the lawmakers, promised to complete all ongoing projects in the state as well as initiate new ones to consolidate on the development recorded in the last 30 months of their administration.
They said more effort would be placed on infrastructure, education, transportation/traffic management, security and health sectors.
In addition, the state government will do more for civil servants though mandatory capacity building, which would be extended to all teachers in public secondary/primary schools, officers in the health service sector and women & youth empowerment alongside Medium and Small/Micro Size Entrepreneurs (MSMSE's).
Outlining the key components of the budget, Governor Ambode said capital expenditure would gulp N699.082billion while N347.039billion would be dedicated to recurrent expenditure.
They said despite the modest achievements recorded in 2017, there was still much work ahead, assuring that government would not relent in its efforts to give Lagosians the best by way of continuous and efficient service delivery.
“Lagos has always been a trailblazer and we must consolidate on the economic gains made so far by initiating people-friendly programmes and projects that will attract more economic improvement in Y2018.
“It is our resolve in Y2018 to strive and complete all on-going projects in order to meet their specified completion period and embark on new strategic projects.
“We intend to improve on our Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) in the face of the dwindling accruable revenue allocation from the Federal Government, sustain our vision on wealth creation and poverty alleviation,” Mr Ambode said.
The Governor also listed key projects captured in the 2018 budget to include the Agege Pen Cinema flyover; alternative routes through Oke-Ira in Eti-Osa to Epe-Lekki Expressway; the 8km regional road to serve as alternative route to connect Victoria Garden City (VGC) with Freedom Road in Lekki Phase I; completion of the on-going reconstruction of Oshodi International Airport Road into a 10-lane road and the BRT Lane from Oshodi to Abule-Egba.
On infrastructural renewal, Mr Ambode said their administration remains committed to sustaining the tempo of continuous construction, rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance of network of roads across the state including those within the boundary areas of Lagos and Ogun States and that the bus reform initiative would be consolidated with the introduction of high and medium capacity buses, construction and completion of bus depots at Oshodi, Anthony, Yaba and many others.
They also said the movement of Mile 12 market to Imota had reached an advanced stage and would be completed in good time to pave way for relocation next year, while the 181 Local Government roads will be commenced as contractors will be mobilized immediately, as well as continuous gridlock resolution, junction improvement, construction of more laybys and advancement of signalization that will improve traffic congestion especially along the Lekki-Epe corridor.
In the area of job creation, the Governor said the government would construct an ICT Focus Incubator Centre in Yaba, commence the development of Imota and Igbonla Light Industrial Park as well as the provision of additional small scale industrial estate at Shala, while the State Employment Trust Fund will disburse more funds to Lagosians to support business and stimulate the economy.
Iowa is no longer one of the most lenient states when it comes to people caught texting and driving.
Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds kicked off a bill-signing event outside the Iowa Department of Public Safety headquarters this morning.
“The bill elevates the act of sending a message while driving to a primary traffic offense,” Reynolds said, “and that means that if you're engaging in sending a text and email or video message of any kind, you can be pulled over and issued a citation.”
The fine for a texting-while-driving ticket will be $30.
“I'm confident that this bill will help send the message to drivers in our state: eyes on the road while driving,'” Reynolds said.
Governor Branstad was joined at the event by legislators and public safety advocates who lobbied for two bills, both of which Branstad signed into law today. One sets up a new monitoring program for repeat drunken drivers and toughens the penalty to a felony for people caught using their smart phones behind the wheel and killing others on the road. The other bill will let police pull a vehicle over if they suspect the driver is using their smart phone for anything other than navigation or to make a phone call.
“We were one of the last states to make it a primary offense to text and drive,” Branstad said. “I think there's only four states that hadn't done that, so this is certainly a good step in the right direction. I think it's going to make a difference.”
The governor, however, had recommended a “Hands Free” law that would have completely barred the use of a smart phone while driving.
“We are pleased that we saw this progress this year and, obviously, we'll see how this works,”Branstad said. “…But a number of states have gone beyong this. Going further with the ‘hands free' law is something that should be considered in the future.”
Iowa Department of Public Safety director Roxann Ryan said with today's bill signing, Iowa has gone from having one of the weakest to one of the toughest laws on texting while driving.
“We cover anything that you're doing on the internet, anything on your phone, anything on any another electronic device,” Ryan said. “We truly are making a difference and I think when people begin to realize how distracted they are when they're driving and they're using electronic devices, hands free is going to be much easier argument to make in the future.”
“Lane departures” were cited in 68 percent of recent traffic fatalities. Ryan said drivers who are distracted with their smart phone tend to drift out of their lane and drive too fast. Branstad says distracted driving, drunk driving and excessive speed are all contributing to the recent increase in traffic fatalities in Iowa.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's worst blizzard this winter exposed a flaw in Beijing's drive to create remote coal mining hubs as it tries to streamline heavy industries and clear the air in populated regions: a lack of railroads to get the fuel to market.
Heavy snow storms snarled the world's largest rail network this week, closing highways, freezing ports and cutting off critical supplies of thermal coal.
The bottlenecks added to a month-long coal price rally and prompted four top utilities to warn of potential heating and electricity shortages ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year.
By Friday, rare heavy snow in south and central regions had eased, but railways were still clogged. State railway operator China Railway Corp has imposed more emergency measures to increase coal deliveries to southern power producers running low on stock.
Rail experts and executives at utilities warn chaotic episodes like this may become more frequent over coming years until new freight lines are built.
“China's railway capacity is seriously inadequate, even though it has invested lots of money each year to build new lines,” said Zhao Jian, professor at Beijing Jiaotong University.
Adding further strain to the system, the government last year required thousands of factories to use rail to ship cargo rather than roads, the nation's favourite mode of transportation.
Aside from rail capacity, the issue can also be traced back to central government policy that has closed small mines and reduced output in the south, limiting availability of regional spot supplies that could normally pick up the slack.
By creating mining hubs in more remote northern and western regions, the fuel has further to travel to get to the coal-fired power plants that produce most of the nation's electricity.
A source at one of the country's top utilities Huaneng reckons imports will play an even bigger role in supplementing their supplies.
“The shifting of the coal hub from east to the west will add potential risks to transportation since we will see coal travelling a longer distance,” they said.
BREAKNECK EXPANSION
Over the past decade, China has ploughed trillions of dollars into expanding its high-speed passenger rail network, but spending growth is starting to slow.
China Rail's investment target this year is the lowest since 2013, and mostly on high-speed passenger tracks.
The somewhat neglected freight network cannot handle the extra capacity.
The nation's first north-south special coal line - the Inner Mongolia to Jiangxi Railway designed to carry 200 million tonnes of cargo and stretching 2,000 km (1,240 miles) - won't be ready until at least 2019.
Existing freight tracks also don't service the regions in dire need of fuel.
The nation's four major tracks with capacity to carry 1.2 billion tonnes each year of freight run west from the coal hinterlands to east coast ports, where fuel is shipped south for delivery inland by truck or barge along the Yangtze River.
SHORING UP
With coal stranded at mines, the authorities have rushed to shore up supplies of fuel.
In the second round of emergency measures, China Railway last week ordered almost 20 regional hubs from Hohot in Inner Mongolia to Kunming in Yunnan in the south to ramp up loadings.
Until Feb. 10, some 46,000 cars of coal a day must be delivered to ensure supplies reach Hunan, Hubei, Shandong and Jiangxi and power plants in other regions that are running low of fuel, it said in a fax reviewed by Reuters.
That equates to about 3 million tonnes of coal, almost 60 percent of China's average daily needs for its coal-fired power sector, according to Reuters calculations.
China Rail had already made coal a priority and restricted shipments of grain and fertiliser south.
China Railway and the National Railway Bureau did not respond to requests for comment.
WELL-INTENTIONED BUT FLAWED
Restrictions on mining are part of efforts to clear the pollution that blankets the north during winters and move heavy industry away from populated urban areas.
The provinces pleading for help after a rare dump of snow were in the south and central regions of Jiangsu, Hunan, and Sichuan.
Those provinces have cut coal output the most in percentage terms in recent years, while Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Xinjiang have ramped up supplies.
Those four-top producing regions accounted for 72 percent of the total coal output in 2017, compared with just over half in 2008, according to data from China's coal transportation association.
The expansion of coal output in these areas, outside China's traditional industrial heartland, has had the desired effect of shifting polluting activities away from the most populous areas.
But analysts say until the rail network fully connects those supply hubs with centres of demand, further congestion problems look likely to persist.
Next month, R.E.M. will celebrate the 25th anniversary of their landmark album, Automatic for the People, with a deluxe reissue. Ahead of the release, the rock icons have shared a previously unheard demo of the mythical lost track, “Devil Rides Backwards”.
(Read: The 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time)
Originally titled “The Devil Rides Backwards on a Horse Called Maybe”, the song is presented in its unfinished form which references a mule instead of a horse. “That was a mistake,” Stipe explains in the expanded liner notes. “It's supposed to be a horse. I think that phrase might have been something that Peter [Buck] pulled from literature. They thought it had a nice ring to it.”
“That was the one that I most wanted to have on the record,” Buck adds. “I really loved that song. Michael just didn't feel that they had it and they like to work by inspiration. But I remember I was in New Orleans and I played a cassette of a lot of rough mixes to a bunch of people. Five years later they'd go, ‘Gosh, whatever happened to that Devil Rides Backwards song?' It got pretty close but it was never finished. So it's on this.”
Hear the haunting acoustic track below.
Automatic for the People 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition Reissue arrives November 10th from Craft Recordings. Pre-orders are available here. Watch the album trailer below.

Dubai - Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) has arrested two men in their thirties in connection with bribery offences as part of an ongoing investigation into international cricket match spot-fixing, local media reported.
The British agency said that the men were arrested on Monday, but declined to name them. However, sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that the arrested men were former Pakistani batsman Nasir Jamshed and a person named Yousuf, who is a suspect in the PSL spot-fixing investigation.
“Two men in their thirties have been arrested by National Crime Agency officers in connection with bribery offences as part of an ongoing investigation into international cricket match spot-fixing,” a statement by NCA said. “The men were arrested on Monday 13 February and have been released on bail until April 2017 pending further enquiries,” it added.
“As part of the ongoing investigation, we are working closely with the Pakistan Cricket Board and International Cricket Council's anti-corruption units. The PCB has launched its own investigation which has resulted in the suspension of three players,” the NCA said.
JAMSHED SUSPENDED AS PAKISTAN CORRUPTION PROBE WIDENS: Former Test opener Nasir Jamshed has become the third player to be suspended by the PCB as part of its ongoing investigation into corruption.
Jamshed joins batsmen Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif, who were provisionally suspended at the weekend and sent home from the PSL being played in Dubai. The 27-year-old Jamshed, who played two Tests in 2013, was not playing in the PSL but was suspended from all forms of cricket for violating the anti-corruption code, the PCB said.
The PCB is investigating whether an international syndicate had attempted to influence matches in the PSL, it said in a statement on Saturday. Two other players who were questioned in the probe, Zulfiqar Babar and Shahzaib Hasan, would be allowed to continue to play in the tournament, Shaharyar said. Fast bowler M Irfan had not been suspended but might be sent a show cause notice over the next couple of days, the PCB chairperson added.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has approved the deployment of Russian warplanes on a disputed island near Japan, accelerating the area's militarisation at a time when Moscow's ties with Tokyo are strained over the roll-out of a U.S. missile system.
In a decree published late on Thursday, Medvedev allowed the Russian Defence Ministry to use a civilian airport on the island of Iturup, as it is known by Russia, or Etorofu, as it is called in Japan, for its warplanes.
The island was one of four seized by Soviet forces at the end of World War Two and is located off the north-east coast of Hokkaido, Japan's biggest prefecture. The dispute over the islands, known as the Kuriles in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan, is so acrimonious that Moscow and Tokyo have not yet signed a peace treaty to mark the end of the war.
Medvedev's decree is the latest step in a Russian military build-up that has seen Moscow deploy some of its newest missile defence systems to the islands and plan to build a naval base there even as it continues talks about the territorial dispute.
The decree was published days before deputy foreign ministers from the two countries are due to hold talks about co-operation on the disputed islands and at a time when Russia is concerned that Japan is allowing Washington to use its territory as a base for a U.S. military build-up in north Asia under the pretext of countering North Korea.
MORE OPTIONS
It is unclear whether Russia will permanently deploy warplanes to the island, which hosted a Soviet air base during the Cold War, or use its airport as and when needed.
The newspaper Kommersant cited an unnamed military source as saying the move would give the Russian military more options.
“This move should show the aerodrome's readiness for fighter planes that patrol our borders to be temporarily based there,” the source was quoted as saying.
The same source was quoted as saying that Russia was particularly concerned about a Japanese plan to deploy more Aegis U.S. missile systems in its Akita and Yagamata prefectures.
The Japanese embassy in Moscow said the Russian move ran counter to what Tokyo was trying to achieve.
“We believe this could result in Russia's military power being strengthened on the four islands and that contradicts Japan's position on the islands,” it said in a statement.
“We need a solution to the territorial problem itself in order to fundamentally address this kind of problems.”
Tokyo would keep holding talks with Russia to try to resolve the wider territorial dispute, the embassy said.

Shamed Rolf Harris was spotted shopping for DIY supplies at Screwfix in Maidenhead this weekend - and their presence didn't go down too well with the local builders.
The 87-year-old paedophile only spent around 15 minutes inside the shop where they bought cable ties, rawl plugs and screws.
But despite keeping their head down, a shopper recognised the former TV star and branded them a "dirty b******".
Rolf reportedly ignored the slur and didn't respond to the builder's taunt.

"Rolf kept their head down and obviously didn't want to be recognised," an unnamed shopper told the Daily Star Sunday .
"He walked past one group of three young builders who started talking about them among themselves.
"One of them called them a dirty b******."
The disgraced entertainer, released from HMP Stafford in May, showed off dark bruising on their legs as they wore a pair of cargo shorts.
(Image: MEGA)
Harris was still wearing their wedding ring and seemed in good health, despite a diabetic episode last December that saw them rushed to hospital for scans and an X-ray.
The former Animal Hospital presenter was dropped off at the shop by a friend and spent 15 minutes inside before leaving in a silver car.
Harris was convicted of 12 indecent assaults against four girls and jailed for five years in July 2014.
(Image: MEGA)
In May, they were cleared of a further four indecent assault charges against three teenage girls between 1971 and 1983. A jury at Southwark Crown Court failed to reach a verdict.
Harris was released having served less than three years.
The Sunday Mirror revealed they are planning a tell-all book about their time behind bars. Laws on profiting from crime mean it cannot be sold here but it could appear in bookshops abroad.
It is thought the memoir will detail the stress and effect the convictions have had on them and their wife Alwen, 84.
 They are also reportedly keen to record an album of songs written in jail and appeal against their convictions.

Landlady's music is more than sonic exploration, it's an adventure. The Brooklyn-based band's songs are the initial creation of leader Adam Schatz, who observes the world with fresh, almost alien eyes. The songs can feel a bit drugged-out – a bit high and full of curiosity – but never overly intoxicated or out-of-touch.
The opening track for Landlady's Tiny Desk performance, "Cadaver," has its origins in a friend of Schatz's who went to medical school, and the years they spent examining a single cadaver over and over and even more specifically about a tattoo on that cadaver's buttocks.
Landlady is also a band of brilliant musicians who carefully craft their playing to serve the songs. Each player on their own might seem to be making quirky sounds or playing odd rhythms, but together they create head-turning tunes.
For their Tiny Desk Concert they came in as a foursome but also recruited the Washington D.C. string quartet, Rogue Collective to flesh-out their sound on the third song, "Electric Abdomen." That cut, which seems to be about being uncomfortable in your own skin, sounds like it came from a long-lost tape from The Beatles during a session for Abbey Road, full of wonder and, like this Tiny Desk performance, worth digging deep into.
Set List
"Cadaver"
"Solid Brass"
"Electric Abdomen"
Musicians
Adam Schatz (keys, vocals); Will Graefe (guitar, vocals); Ryan Dugre (bass, vocals); Ian Chang (drums, vocals); Alexa Cantalupo (violin); Livia Amoruso (violin); Deanna Said (viola); Natalie Spehar (cello)

SEOUL - The half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has been assassinated in Malaysia, South Korean media reported Tuesday, with one TV station saying they were attacked at the main airport with poisoned needles.
Officials in Seoul could not be reached for comment on the reported death of Kim Jong-Nam. Malaysian police said an unidentified Korean had been taken sick at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and since died.
If confirmed, Kim's case would be the highest-profile death under the Kim Jong-Un regime since the execution of the leader's uncle Jang Song-Thaek in December 2013. Kim Jong-Un has been trying to strengthen their grip on power in the face of growing international pressure over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.
The latest missile launch on Sunday brought UN Security Council condemnation.
South Korea's national news agency Yonhap quoted a Seoul government source as saying Kim Jong-Nam was killed on Monday. The source gave no further details. The 45-year-old was poisoned by two unidentified female agents using poisoned needles at an airport in Kuala Lumpur, according to South Korean broadcaster TV Chosun.
The report, citing what it called multiple government sources, said the two women hailed a cab and fled immediately afterwards. In Malaysia, the police chief in charge of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Assistant Commissioner Abdul Aziz Ali, told AFP a Korean in their forties was found sick at the airport on Monday.
Airport authorities rushed them to the hospital and they died on the way, the police chief said.
"We do not have any other details of this Korean man. We do not know their identity," Abdul said. Kim Jong-Nam was once considered heir apparent but fell out of favour with their father Kim Jong-Il following an embarrassing botched attempt in 2001 to enter Japan on a forged passport and visit Disneyland. They have since lived in virtual exile, mainly in the Chinese territory of Macau.
Jong-Nam's half-brother Jong-Un took over as North Korean leader when their father died in December 2011. Jong-Nam, known as an advocate of reform in the North, once told a Japanese newspaper that they opposed their country's dynastic power transfers.
They were reportedly close to their uncle Jang Song-Thaek, once the North's unofficial number two and political mentor of the current leader. Jong-Nam has been targeted in the past.
In October 2012 South Korean prosecutors said a North Korean detained as a spy had admitted involvement in a plot to stage a hit-and-run car accident in China in 2010 targeting Kim Jong-Nam.
In 2014 Jong-Nam was reported to be in Indonesia -- sighted at an Italian restaurant run by a Japanese business person in Jakarta -- and was said to be shuttling back and forth between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France. In 2012 a Moscow newspaper reported that Jong-Nam was having financial problems after being cut off by the Stalinist state for doubting its succession policy. The Argumenty i Fakty weekly said they were kicked out of a luxury hotel in Macau over a $15,000 debt.
Last year South Korea warned of possible North Korean assassination attempts on its territory. It noted previous attempts to assassinate Hwang Jang-Yop, the North's chief ideologue and former tutor to Kim Jong-Il, who defected to the South in 1997 and died of natural causes in 2010. Jong-Nam was born from their father's extra-marital relationship with Sung Hae-rim, a South Korean-born actor who died in Moscow.

After the recent Starbucks incident involving the arrest of two Black men in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, most Black people had one of two responses: either boycott Starbucks or open our own coffee shops.
National Eat at a Black Coffee Shop Day combines the best of these ideas. On Tuesday, May 29, 2018, tens of thousands of Starbucks customers will try a new coffee experience at a Black-owned coffee shop.
Black coffee houses, coffee shops and tea houses, under the umbrella of The Black Star Project, have formed a federation to flex their collective and connective muscle in the competitive coffee marketplace.
They are working together to get out the word that their coffees are just as good, or better, than Starbucks.
These Black coffee houses expect to win significant market share on Tuesday, May 29, because that day Starbucks is closing more than 8,000 U.S. units for diversity training.
Phillip Jackson, Chairman of the Board for The Black Star Project says, “We expect substantially higher sales at each store and it is our intention to keep and grow any market share we earn on this day. Stores will be well-stocked with pastries, cakes, cookies, coffees and teas for the expected new business”.
In addition to regular business on Tuesday, May 29, Black coffee shops are being encouraged to offer evening “Black Economic Empowerment Forums” as a catalyst to spur economic development in Black communities across America.
All of this is part of the Campaign to “Circulate Black Dollars in the Black Community,” which is designed to raise the percentage of the $1.3 trillion spent in Black communities by Black consumers last year and to re-circulate those dollars back into the Black community.
Jackson also says, “If we can raise our spending with each other from our current 2 percent to a modest 10 percent, we would no longer require or need to ask for help from government, foundations or others.”
So far, more than 400 Black Coffee Houses, Coffee Shops and Tea Houses around the U.S. are expected to participate in “National Eat at a Black Coffee House Day.”
Visit www.blackstarjournal.org/2018/05/03/500-black-coffee-houses-and-cafes/ to see a list of 400 Black-owned coffee shops and cafes in the U.S. or go to www.blacktarproject.org for more information about this campaign, or call 773.285.9600.

Page Chamber of Commerce held their monthly mixer last night at the Page Library. Local business owners came together to share ideas, network and talk about upcoming events, fundraisers and opportunities. Page City Council member Levi Tappan chose the moment after the meeting to make the impromptu announcement that they plan to run for the Mayor seat. A total of five council member's terms expire this year including the Mayor.
The Page native says in the five years he's been on the Council he's especially proud of their work getting the new playground equipment for Golliard Park.

Interim University President Dr. Philip Way held their third fireside chat during common hour Tuesday on the second floor of the Smith Student Center.
These informal discussions with students are geared towards starting a dialogue with students by hearing their likes and dislikes regarding SRU. It is this direct approach to engaging with the student body that Way hopes to see in Slippery Rock's future university president.
“Everyone has different styles of leading or interacting with students,” Way said. “I have always thought it was important to go where the students are as opposed to having them come to you to start a dialogue; an office environment just isn't natural for these informal discussions,” said Dr. Way.
These fireside chats are building off of former president Dr. Cheryl Norton's initiatives to engage with SRU students. Norton would pick a different place on campus to visit during the week for a meet and greet sessions with students. However, attendance at these events was sparse and they were often poorly advertised by the administration. Way chose the second floor of the Student Center because it is a central location on campus and would be frequented by students during common hour.
“On the whole, communication is the key to building any positive relationship with the students,” Way said. “Attendance for these chats has been minimal so far, but the conversations we are having have been profound and enlightening.”
Way hopes to have the chats every so often throughout their semester-long tenure as interim president.  They are also continuing the use of the Twitter account started by Norton last year in an effort to alert students daily through social media. Lunches with various sororities and fraternities and other campus groups have begun as well.
“I am confident that student participation in these chats will grow over the course of the semester,” Way said. “We will continue to have informative talks about the future of our university and what steps we can take moving forward to ensure that future.”
Students can see updates on social media by following Way on Twitter at @SRUPresident.
LEXINGTON, Ky. -- PJ Washington will return to Kentucky after withdrawing from the NBA draft, while their Wildcats teammate Wenyen Gabriel has decided to turn pro.
The Wildcats are still awaiting Jarred Vanderbilt's decision on whether the first-year student forward will return to school or remain in the draft.
Washington, who participated in the NBA combine, posted a video on their social media accounts Wednesday that ended with the words "I'M BACK." The 6-foot-7 Dallas native will be the Wildcats' top returning scorer and rebounder next season after averaging 10.8 points and 5.7 rebounds in 37 games as a first-year student in 30 starts.
The 6-9 Gabriel was not invited to the combine but said in a video on their Twitter account that after receiving positive feedback, their dreams of being a professional "are that much closer to reality." They averaged 6.8 points and 5.4 rebounds last season.

Inspector General Police (IGP) Punjab Capt (Retd) Arif Nawaz Khan has said that excellent professional training of force is the need of hour to face the challenges of modern times and for this purpose all the sources will be utilized.
They expressed these views while addressing the officials at Police Training Centre Chuhng and inaugural of RPO Sheikhupura region office.
They said that along with physical and mental training, attention should also be paid towards the character building of under training officials so that they can show responsibility and professional skills in field and for strengthening the relation between police and public. They further said, “Being the commander of Punjab police it is my top most priority to take measures for the welfare and capacity building of the force and for this purpose I will continue to take practical steps according to principles of smart and community policing.”
IG Punjab inaugurated newly built auditorium, food court and other sections. This auditorium is the largest auditorium of Punjab police with a capacity of accommodating 700 people at a time. Different training programs and events will be held in the auditorium for under training officials.
Commandant Police training college Fiaz Ahmad Dev briefed the IG Punjab about the reforms and different projects initiated in the college during previous three years.
The Coast Guard's Marine Safety Unit in Morgan City is in for some changes, but not the kind of changes some feared, the unit's outgoing commander said.
Cmdr. Heather R. Mattern will become the first woman to lead the Morgan City unit during a change of command ceremony at 11 a.m. Thursday at the Morgan City Municipal Auditorium.
Mattern will succeed Capt. Blake Welborn, who will become the commander of the Coast Guard's Houma facility. Welborn said they will continue as captain of the port for the Morgan City area with responsibility for maintaining smooth and safe operations on the waterways. Welborn will also assume that role in Houma.
Rumors saying the Morgan City facility would be merged with the Coast Guard operation in Houma began making the email rounds last week. Welborn appeared at Monday's Port of Morgan City meeting and said the Coast Guard is staying in Morgan City.
The possibility that the Coast Guard would move out of Morgan City to Houma was especially touchy after the recent closure of PHI Inc.'s Amelia facility, which was consolidated with PHI's Houma operation.
But “the Coast Guard is not moving out of Morgan City,” Welborn said at Monday's port meeting.
“That is as far from the truth as can be.”
In an interview, Welborn said some personnel changes between the two Coast Guard facilities may happen later.
But Morgan City's Coast Guard operation will continue to perform functions such as hazardous spill response and law enforcement with its two-craft small boat unit, Welborn said.
Mattern is currently stationed in New York City. Them promotion to commander was approved during the 2015-16 Congress.
In 2011 at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, Mattern wrote a thesis titled “Laser Peening for Mitigation of Stress Corrosion Cracking at Welds in Marine Aluminum.”
An online search turned up articles in which Mattern, as a Coast Guard officer, was involved in events for senior citizens and kids at a children's shelter.
AMESBURY, England (Reuters) - British counter-terrorism officers joined a police investigation on Wednesday after two people were found in critical condition from suspected exposure to an unknown substance near the English city where a former Russian spy was poisoned.
Britain's Sun newspaper reported that the man and woman had been poisoned and were showing similar symptoms to those displayed by ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and their daughter Yulia who were victims of a nerve agent attack in March.
The Sun said samples of the toxin involved had been sent to the nearby military research centre of Porton Down for testing.
The pair, both in their 40s, were hospitalised in a critical condition after being found unconscious on Saturday in Amesbury, seven miles (11 km) north of Salisbury where the Skripals were found slumped unconscious on a bench on March 4.
Britain has blamed the poisoning of the Skripals on Russia, something that Moscow has denied but which caused a serious diplomatic crisis between it and Western states.
“They (couple) are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance,” Wiltshire county police, which took the rare step of declaring “a major incident”, said in a statement.
“Based upon the number of casualties affected, it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public.”
There was no word on the identity of the couple.
A police spokesperson declined to confirm whether the couple were believed to have been poisoned or whether Porton Down scientists were now involved. But London police confirmed that specialist counter-terrorism officers were helping the inquiry.
“As Wiltshire police have stated, they are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding the incident and will update the public as soon and as regularly as possible,” a London spokesperson said.

Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesperson said the government's emergency response committee had met to discuss the incident and that May and ministers were being regularly updated on the developments.
TESTS ON NATURE OF SUBSTANCE
The pair, who were being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs. More than three days after they were found, tests were still being conducted to ascertain what substance made them ill.
“We are working with the police to understand the circumstances surrounding this incident and it would be inappropriate to make further comment at this time, while we establish how they became unwell,” said Cara Charles-Barks, the hospital's chief executive.
The hospital is where the Skripals also spent weeks in a critical condition in the same hospital before slowly recovering and being discharged.
Police said sites in both Amesbury and Salisbury that they believed the man and woman found in Amesbury had frequented would be cordoned off as a precaution.
Britain accused Russia of poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a chemical weapon on European soil since World War Two.
Moscow denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
Russia has said it does not possess such nerve agents, did not develop Novichok, and President Vladimir Putin dismissed as nonsense the notion that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and their 33-year-old daughter.
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies in Europe and the United States sided with Prime Minister Theresa May's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.
Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats, questioning how Britain knows that Russia was responsible and offering its rival interpretations, including that it amounted to a plot by British secret services.

It's a hockey fanatic's favorite time of year.
NHL hockey is back for the 2017-18 season, and with it arrives a whole new list of unknowns.
Can the Pittsburgh Penguins become the first team to win three Stanley Cups in a row since the New York Islanders won four in a row from 1980-83? Who will be the Columbus Blue Jackets of this season? How will the Vegas Golden Knights perform?
Although these queries won't officially be answered for six to eight months, here's a look at how the 2017-18 season could shake down.
New Arrival with The Biggest Impact
In an off-season that included several notable transactions involving impact players like Patrick Marleau (Maple Leafs), Kevin Shattenkirk (Rangers), and Artemi Panarin (Blue Jackets), the Montreal Canadiens will prove to be the real winner when the 2017-18 season concludes.
Jonathan Drouin, acquired in a trade with the Tampa Bay Lightning, brings a highly-explosive offensive game to a team in dire need of such a player. Since the 2009-10 season, the Canadiens have cracked the top ten in goals scored only once.
Drouin, 22, tallied 95 points (29 goals, 66 assists) in 164 regular season games with the Lightning, while also adding 14 points in 23 playoff games.
Max Pacioretty has led the Canadiens in scoring each of the last six seasons, but failed to eclipse the 70-point mark in any of those seasons, largely due to the absence of a dynamic counterpart. Not only will Drouin fill that void, but they set up both themselves and Pacioretty for career years.
With the talent and offensive firepower possessed by both Pacioretty and Drouin, the sky is the limit for the duo and the Canadiens offense.
Vegas Expectations
Just like any expansion team in any league, the Vegas Golden Knights will be in tough.
Goaltending is the only area not in question. Marc-Andre Fleury will shoulder a heavy workload this season and will give their team the opportunity to win its fair share of games. But it won't be enough.
Despite the solid goaltending Fleury will provide, the Golden Knights don't yet have the firepower or depth to consistently compete with organizations that have been building their rosters for years.
The top line of Jonathan Marchessault, Vadim Shipachyov, and Reilly Smith should have no problem finding the back of the net, but the remaining three lines will struggle mightily.
There will be ups and downs for the new club and their fans during the inaugural season, but the downs will far outweigh the ups.
The 2017-18 season will end with the Golden Knights being bottom three in the standings, but with a good chance of winning the draft lottery and potentially finding a future face of the franchise.
Most Surprising Team
Every season, there seems to be one team that surprises everyone – a team no one expects to be in playoff contention, let alone make the playoffs. Last season, it was the Columbus Blue Jackets. Two seasons ago it was the Florida Panthers.
This season, the Buffalo Sabres are primed for a breakout.
Fresh off of signing Jack Eichel to an eight-year, $80 million contract extension, the Sabres have all the pieces to be a playoff team.
The off-season acquisitions of forwards Jason Pominville, Benoit Pouliot, and Seth Griffith add to an already dangerous group led by Eichel, Ryan O'Reilly, Kyle Okposo, and Sam Reinhart. If everyone in the Sabres' top nine can stay healthy, this team will have no problem finding twine.
The Sabres also added two key defensemen in Nathan Beaulieu and Marco Scandella, which makes for a more reliable defensive core with Rasmus Ristolainen and Jake McCabe already on the back end.
With the pieces they have on offense and defense, the Sabres will find themselves in the postseason for the first time since 2010-11.
Dark Horse Goaltender
Everyone expects top goaltenders like Carey Price, Braden Holtby, and Sergei Bobrovsky to perform well. It's why they get paid more than the average goalie, and it's why they get criticized more than the average goalie.
But there's also the dark horse; the underdog.
Everyone loves an underdog story, and this year it will be Frederik Andersen.
Although the Toronto Maple Leafs had a strong overall season in 2016-17, Andersen struggled at times posting a 2.67 goals-against average (GAA) and a .918 save percentage. The 2.67 GAA was the highest of their career.
On a team as raw as the Maple Leafs were last season, there were bound to be some growing pains defensively. But, with Mike Babcock likely making defense a top priority this season and the younger players gaining more experience, the stars could align for Andersen to have an outstanding year.
Andersen has all the skills to be a top goaltender in the NHL, and, with a little help from their teammates, will be that guy this season.
Who Wins the Calder Trophy?
In a season lacking a Connor McDavid or Auston Matthews-type rookie, the race for the Calder Trophy is truly anyone's game.
It won't necessarily come down to who leads the rookie scoring race, but who is given the biggest opportunity.
Boston Bruins rookie defenseman Charlie McAvoy finds themselves in the perfect situation to have an outstanding rookie campaign.
McAvoy will begin the season locked into a top four defensive roles, while also quarterbacking the top power play unit until Torey Krug returns.
Not only do they have a huge opportunity, they also have significant experience after playing last season's playoff series against the Ottawa Senators, tallying three assists in the process.
Although McAvoy won't be challenging Nico Hischier or Clayton Keller for the rookie scoring title, the significant role they play on the blue line coupled with the 40-plus points they amass will win them the Calder Trophy.
Surprise Team to Miss Playoffs
Just like the surprise team to make the playoffs, there's always the team that doesn't live up to expectations.
Whether it's bad luck with injuries or too many significant off-season departures to offset, it happens every year.
Unfortunately for hockey fans in Tennessee, the Nashville Predators may leave you disappointed come April.
After making it to the Stanley Cup Finals last season, the expectations surrounding the Predators are sky-high.
But, overshadowed in the deep playoff run is the reality that the Predators squeaked into the playoffs with 94 points for the final wild-card spot, which may have been a different story with a significant injury or two.
Well, the injury bug has already arrived in Nashville as defensemen Ryan Ellis is set to miss at least the first half of the season due to knee surgery. The Predators also said goodbye to forwards James Neal and Mike Fisher in the offseason.
The Predators aren't the same team without Ellis, Neal, and Fisher, and, although the off-season acquisitions of Scott Hartnell, Nick Bonino, and Alexi Emelin may soften the blow a little, it won't be enough.
Who Wins the Stanley Cup?
In eight of the last nine seasons, the Stanley Cup has been won by one of three teams: the Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks, or Los Angeles Kings.
Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins would like to keep that trend going, while also defending the title for the third year in a row.
But as much as Sid the Kid and company would like to make it a three-peat, there's a new kid on the block named Connor McDavid looking for their first taste of Stanley Cup glory. And they don't want to wait.
The Edmonton Oilers proved in last season's playoffs they're for real.
The Oilers outplayed the San Jose Sharks in every facet of their opening 4-2 series win, a Sharks team that's been to playoffs 11 of the last 12 seasons. They gave the Anaheim Ducks all they could handle in a series that went the full seven games; a series they probably should've won.
The off-season acquisitions of Jussi Jokinen and Ryan Strome add even more depth and experience to an already elite roster.
This season, the Oilers will deploy a well-balanced lineup led by the most dynamic player in the NHL, and use the experience from last season's playoff run to win their first Stanley Cup since 1990.
The time is now for the McDavid and the Oilers.
Artificial rain is set to fall on mountainous plains three times the size of Spain. At least, that's the plan for China's latest weather manipulation project.
As reported by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the system includes solid fuel burners, drones, planes, artillery, and a network of weather satellites covering vast swathes of the Indian Ocean. The aim is to create a distributed system capable of combatting climate change and increasing rainfall in the region by up to ten billion cubic meters, or approximately seven percent of China's annual water consumption.
However, while early reports indicate success, the project—and artificial rain technology in general—has its critics and detractors. Some refer to the unproven nature of the technology, and others fear the project could increase international tensions in the volatile region.
Super-Sizing Known Tech and Adding Satellites
China's new project involves placing thousands of chambers burning solid fuels on the Tibetan plateau. When lit, the chambers will produce silver iodide. The iodide acts as condensate for water molecules in the air. As more and more water molecules gather around the iodide molecules, they become heavier and fall to the earth as rain or snow. The process is known as cloud seeding.
Each year, moist monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean sweep north towards the Himalayan mountains. Real-time data, collected from a network of 30 weather satellites monitoring monsoon activities, will ensure that the burning of fuel coincides with optimal conditions for binding the monsoon water mists with the iodide released by the burners, thereby increasing rain and snowfall. The burner network will be assisted by cloud seeding done by drones, planes, and even artillery in an effort to maximize its effect.
The SCMP, citing an unnamed scientist working on the project, reports that 500 burning chambers have already been erected, with initial results proving very promising. According to the report, a burning chamber costs around $8,000. Once completed, “tens of thousands of chambers” will be positioned throughout the Tibetan plateau. The ambition is to increase rainfall over an area of about 1.6 million square kilometers (620,000 square miles), making it the world's largest artificial rain project.
Climate change is a prime reason China is undertaking this project. According to the SCMP, climate models predict that the area will suffer severe droughts as temperatures rise and regional rainfall decreases. This would pose significant risks for both China and its neighbors, as the Tibetan plateau is a vital source of water for much of the region.
Increasing Quest for Weather Control
China has been working on technological ways of manipulating the weather, including finding ways to gather or distribute fresh water, for many years, including during the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Another recent proposal is the so-called Sky River project, first announced in 2016. Its goal is to increase water supply in China's arid northern regions by evaporating water and using north-turned air currents to transport the vapor north.
Closer to the ground, weather manipulation has been suggested as a way to combat the high pollution levels found in many of the country's major cities. The project involves attaching large sprinkler-like systems to the outside of skyscrapers. Spraying water out into the air would—hopefully—bind toxins and gases to the water, thereby reducing toxic smog.
China is by no means the only country pursuing weather manipulation projects. In 2016, 56 countries had such programs, compared to 42 in 2011.
The idea has been around for a while and was even used during the Vietnam War. Known as Operation Popeye, the objective was to increase rainfall during monsoon season to make the terrain muddy and difficult to traverse for enemy fighters. According to a Paleofuture article, the unofficial moniker of the Air Force pilots who carried out the missions was “make mud, not war.”
Given Rain by Taking Water?
Final approval for the project by Chinese authorities is still pending, but it has already raised concern in other regions in China as well as neighboring countries. Manipulation of the weather to produce more rain over the Tibetan plains might lower rainfall elsewhere. Tibet is also often referred to as Asia's water tower and is the source of rivers like the Brahmaputra, Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow River. Could increase rainfall in certain geographic regions have an influence on how much water flows to each river? This question is thus far unanswered, and these kinds of worries extend to other weather manipulation projects around the world.
Critics also point to the less-than-proven viability of weather manipulation.
Ma Weiqiang, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, called the experiment “unprecedented,” but they doubt the chambers' ability to affect the weather.
“I am skeptical about the amount of rainfall they can produce. A weather system can be huge. It can make all human efforts look vain,” Ma said to SCMP.
Others are more optimistic about the potential found in such projects.
“[…] even a ten percent increase in rainfall or snowfall may be worth the expense,” Bart Geerts, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Wyoming, put it to Business Insider.

MP: Elections in Azerbaijan led to development, and in Armenia - to political chaos
2018-04-24 19:24 | www.trend.az | 1
Baku, Azerbaijan, April 24
By Elchin Mehdiyev - Trend:
The election held in Azerbaijan has led to development and strengthening of stability, while the election held in Armenia has led to political chaos and aggravation of situation, Azerbaijani MP Bakhtiyar Aliyev said.
They made the remarks commenting on Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan's resignation on April 23 amid the continuing rallies in the country.
MP Aliyev said that reason for such a result is very clear.
"Because, completely democratic processes take place in Azerbaijan, the government expresses the will of its people, there is a people-government unity, people freely make choice and show great confidence in the current government."
"However, the situation in Armenia is completely different. Everyone who came to power in Armenia killed opponents and was in conflict with the will of Armenian people, remained in power threatening people with a war. Therefore, the people have never supported these regimes and we have seen falsifications and violations of the law in the elections in Armenia, protests of Armenian people for many years, and how ruthlessly the army suppressed those protests," the MP said.
That is why, according to Aliyev, what is happening today in Armenia is natural.
"Armenian people have finally their say and remove the fascist regime from the power," they said.
"However, it is too early to talk about how long the political crisis in Armenia will last, because clashes between clans will become even more acute in Armenia," they said.
MP Aliyev stressed that Armenia, which is in a state of crisis, will not be able to recover for long.
"Today, Azerbaijan has a strong economic and political potential. Azerbaijan's stability and development are based on natural foundations, because the reforms in Azerbaijan are stable, consistent, and this serves the peace, tranquility and prosperous life of the people," the MP said.
Mass rallies broke out in Yerevan and other Armenian cities on April 13 following former Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan's nomination as prime minister. The opposition accused them of ineffective governance and worsening the economic situation in the country.
On April 23, Serzh Sargsyan resigned as Armenian prime minister.

Five people are riding bicycles cross-country from Oregon to Washington D.C. and they're pedaling along Iowa's western border this weekend — the halfway point in their three-month journey.
Dyar Bentz, the program director for the Light the Trail Ride, says they're raising money and awareness about an important cause.
“It's sort of a half-outreach and half-fundraiser program called the Jordan Elizabeth Harris Foundation,” Bentz says. “This is a group that is dedicated to depression research and suicide prevention.” The organization is based in Fort Worth, Texas. It's named for the late daughter of Tom Harris, who's one of the cyclists on the long trek. Harris says their daughter suffered from depression and took their own life in 2012. They say the ride is all about starting conversations on the topic.
“When people see the sign on the side of our van or our truck, they're always asking how we're doing and why we're doing it and what the background is,” Harris says. “It gives us an opportunity to share our story and generally, we get one back. Somebody in whoever's family that's either struggling with depression or even more unfortunately, somebody that may've lost someone to suicide.”
The nationwide adventure is taking the cyclists along the Lewis and Clark Trail and it's posed a string of physical challenges. Harris says they're doing well and managing to stick to their scheduled goals.
“For a couple of old guys, our frames and bodies are holding up pretty darn good,” they say. “We've experienced all kinds of weather. We've seen heavy winds, rain, snow. It's been an interesting ride to say the least.”
They reached Sioux City on Thursday and plan to be in Missouri Valley by Saturday. The group left Oregon on September 3rd and hopes to arrive in Washington D.C. on Veterans Day, November 11th. So far, they've raised $175,000. Harris hopes to expand the foundation nationwide.
As previously promised, Russia is cracking down on VPN services, with a new law that comes into force today giving the government fresh powers to ensure that websites that it wants blocked, stay blocked.
As you may be aware, VPNs can be used to access sites which are banned in a particular country, by giving the user an IP address that makes it appear that they're based in another country.
But the new legislation combats the circumvention of such content restrictions, by requiring VPN providers to put a hard block on websites which Roskomnadzor (the Russian government communications watchdog) has deemed should be censored.
In short, a VPN will no longer be an effective way to get around such government censorship – providing that VPN services enact the law as required.
Refusing isn't an option
If the VPN provider refuses to register with Roskomnadzor and implement the watchdog's blacklist of sites within a month, those services will be blocked, as The Moscow Times reports.
Last month, search engines were also banned from displaying results for government blacklisted sites.
Over in China we've also seen tighter anti-VPN measures come into play throughout the course of this year, with the government starting to implement measures that only allow ‘approved' VPNs to operate, and pushing Apple to remove certain VPN apps from its App Store.
TEHRAN: Iran has denied receiving any invitation from Saudi Arabia for talks on the hajj, after a row between the arch-foes saw its pilgrims stay at home last year.
The Al-Hayat daily reported on Friday that Saudi pilgrims minister Mohammed Bentin had opened discussions with more than 80 countries, including Iran, to work out the details of the 2017 hajj.
"No invitation from Saudi Arabia has been received by Iran´s Hajj and Pilgrimage Organisation or the foreign ministry," the head of the Hajj Organisation, Hamid Mohammadi, was quoted as saying in Iranian media reports on Monday.
Once the invitation was received, Iranians would only be able to take part in the hajj if "the Saudi side secures the conditions of dignity and security" for them, said Mohammadi.
Iran was doing all it could to open the "blocked path" to the hajj, they said.
The annual pilgrimage, which starts and ends in the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, is a must for all able-bodied Muslims who can afford it.
More than 1.8 million faithful took part in 2016, but Iranians stayed at home for the first time in three decades after tensions between Riyadh and Tehran boiled over following a deadly stampede during the 2015 pilgrimage.
Iran says it lost 464 people in the crush outside Makkah.
Saudi Arabia cut all ties with Tehran in January 2016 after Iranian demonstrators torched its embassy and a consulate following its execution of a prominent Shiite cleric.
Shiite Iran and predominantly Sunni Saudi Arabia are at odds over a raft of regional issues, notably the conflicts in Syria and Yemen in which they support opposing sides.

Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers Association (PHMA) has felicitated the newly-appointed Federal Commerce and Textile Minister Pervaiz Malik and vowed that value-added textile industry was ready to work closely with the government with a view to enhance the exports and revive growth momentum.
PHMA Chairman Adil Butt said here that Textile Ministry had since long been operating without its minister, adding that with appointment of new commerce and textile minister would help boost country's exports especially of the value-added textile, while all the macro and micro issues of the trade and commerce would be addressed. Adil Butt said that growth of value-added textile industry was a must to steer the industry of worse situation and contribute to the exports of the country. They observed that the domestic industry should be let to grow while enjoying the right to avail opportunities against the competitors.
PHMA Chairman hoped that the new Minister would take measures to further revitalize country's economy. “PHMA appreciates the decision of Prime Minister Shahid Kahqan Abbasi to appoint such an experienced person on this important post to promote exports. Pervaiz Malik belongs to business community and their cooperation and coordination is always appreciable in this regard.” They expressed the optimism that Pervaiz Malik would work for promotion of export by taking the whole trade and industry onboard.—APP
Toronto police say four men are facing a combined 97 charges after a shocking broad daylight street chase in Regent Park on Monday in which four vehicles were damaged, a police officer run down and shots fired.
Amazingly, no one was hurt after plainclothes officers engaged suspects around 2:30 p.m. near Parliament and Dundas Street East.
“The occupants in the vehicle were wearing hooded sweat tops tied tight around their faces and sunglasses on a humid day which appeared to be an attempt to disguise their identity,” Const. Jen Sidhu told Global Newsradio 640Toronto. “The officer called for assistance, and a second plainclothes officer arrived to observe the same vehicle.”

Sidhu said one of the four men got out of the vehicle on Parliament Street and fired a gun in a “northerly” direction before getting back into the car which proceeded to drive off pursued by the two officers.
The vehicle was eventually boxed in by responding marked and unmarked police cruisers at Sherbourne and Shuter streets. As officers attempted to enter the vehicle to arrest the occupants, the driver attempted an escape.
“The driver reversed the vehicle, collided with a police vehicle and drove at a police officer striking them but not causing serious injury.”
The suspect driver then drove west into oncoming traffic down Shuter Street, ignored a red light and collided with a taxi at the intersection of Jarvis and Shuter.

The vehicle then drove north on Jarvis at oncoming traffic to Dundas East pursued by police, before making a left-hand turn onto Dundas colliding with another cab.
“The vehicle continued westbound on Dundas Street on the east sidewalk narrowly missing pedestrians.”
The driver then crashed into a police cruiser and garbage cans attempting to make a high-speed turn onto Mutual Avenue. All four men then exited the vehicle pursued on foot by police.
All four men were eventually apprehended by police along with two firearms and transported to 51 division.
Shakiem Anderson, 21, of Mississauga; Harlem Baldwin, 20, of Toronto; Sharrieff Muhammad, 22, of Toronto; and Kareemallah Muhammad, 18, of Toronto are facing 97 charges combined in connection to the possession and misuse of firearms, dangerous driving and failure to remain.
All four men made a court appearance on Tuesday and are remanded in custody until their next court appearance on Tuesday, June 5.

A Monty Python superfan who met their girlfriend through their own Python-fan dating site proposed in front of two of their idols.
Python fanatic John Wood has finally found love with fellow fan Gemma Harris who loves the wacky comedy as much as they do.
So they popped the question in front of Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam.
John had been single for five years before Gemma's uncle spotted an article about the Python dating Facebook group in a national paper by chance and showed it to them
(Photo: SWNS)
After two-and-a-half years of dating, John decided it was time to make Gemma their 'wife of Brian' and popped the question the best way they could.
They said: "We both went to this show where we were going to be in the presence of Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin.
"I've met them many times before but I just thought this would be perfect."
(Photo: SWNS)
The 33-year-old, who lived in Netheravon, near Salisbury, then joined and the pair started their new romance just two-and-a-half years ago.
The 57-year-old is the first to find love in the group, which has more than 140 members and aims to help fans "find each other, and so find love, intellectual fulfilment and everlasting happiness".
John decided to pop the question at a show featuring the Pythons, hosted by Sanjeev Bhaskar, called 'An Englishman and Indian and an American Walk into a Bar at the Roundhouse' in Camden, north London, on February 3.

The social media manager - who has thousands of pounds worth of memorabilia, has seen Python musical Spamalot 13 times and has met most of the cast members on numerous occasions - managed to get the cast gathered around as they got down on one knee.
John added: "It was very tricky, I was so nervous I had no idea if everything was going to come together, I was on my own Gemma's had no idea where I was, finally the moment arrived and I did it in the VIP after party.
(Photo: SWNS)
"I got two strangers to film and take still pictures and they got a really good shot where you can see the ring, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam are behind and Gemma is just so excited - it just looks so magical.
"Michael Palin even says 'will you marry me?' and then they said 'I wish you a long and happy life together', which was very nice.
"Apparently we were the first proposal at the Roundhouse and we are the first Python wedding from the Facebook group."
(Photo: SWNS)
The pair, who now live in East Grinstead, West Sussex, have previously been on a romantic trip to Paris to visit the locations where scenes from their favourite film Brazil, directed by Python animator Terry Gillian, were shot.
But John decided to search for a partner who shared their passion for the comedy, which started in 1969, famous for the Dead Parrot sketch, Ministry of Silly Walks and the Lumberjack song, after their first wife disliked the series.
So John set up the Pythonesque Dating Facebook page to try and find love.
John said: "When I was married the first time for 15 years my ex-wife didn't like Python.
(Photo: SWNS)
"Since it's been a major part of my life since I was 13, I thought my next girlfriend should be a Python fan.
"It's very rare I meet anyone as into it as I am. If you love something it makes you more compatible.
"I couldn't find any girls as obsessed with Python as I was so I thought I had to set up my own dating site and Facebook group.

"So they joined the site and we got chatting and met and just went from there. We had so much in common."
As a superfan, John won a competition to tweet for a new film about Graham Chapman, A liar's Autobiography, by proving they were the "biggest fan" to by the British Film Institute in 2012 after dedicating 43 years to the BBC series and the spin-off films.
John says they even met their first wife through their love of Python as they only knew them through their friendship with their ex-husband - who they were friends with because they both liked the show.
Father-of-one, John, added: "I'm sure there's going to be other single Python fans out there who really should be together, it would be great to bring another couple together just like us.
"It's not just a TV show, it's about how you look at the world. It's about finding someone else who understands that whacky comedy and when you do it really works.
"Gemma is a big fan, they are a close second, we always analyse the shows and talk about what we find funny. I'm still finding new things funny about it 40 years later.
"Things remind us of Python all the time, situations we find ourselves in all the time such as she'll ask me a question and I'll reply with Python joke. It's the kind of thing no one else would get."
The happy couple haven't set a date or decided on the venue, which may or may not include a Python theme.
John said: "I just want something classic, I don't think either of us are going to be doing silly walks down the aisle."

Vol fans are planning an exciting setting for the upcoming matchup between the No. 24 UT mens' basketball team and defending national champion No. 11 North Carolina Tarheels at Thompson-Boling Arena on Sunday, Dec. 17. The 7-1 Vols are coming off a 81-71 home win against the Lipscomb Bisons on Saturday.
Plans to checker Thompson-Boling Arena during the sold-out game are being promoted by the university's athletic department, which issued a release on Saturday asking fans to visit CheckerTBA.com to see which color they should wear based on their seats to help make the event a reality.
Bring your orange. Or bring your white.
Next Sunday will be a sight to behold. #CheckerTBA

The game is set to begin at 3 p.m. on Dec. 17, and Volshop stores will be selling t-shirts in orange and white for fans to wear during the game, according to the release. Vols basketball junior Forward Admiral Schofield said in the release that the atmosphere would be "electric."
"First, we're excited about the opportunity to play a great team like North Carolina at home in front of a sold-out crowd," Schofield said. "But to envision playing that game in front of a human checkerboard of more than 21,000 fans… we can't wait to see it. I know Thompson-Boling Arena is going to be electric."

While plans to checker Neyland Stadium in recent years have seen considerable success with fans, the release pointed out that the tradition first started with a March 2006 game against the then unranked Kentucky Wildcats during Bruce Pearl's first year at UT. The then 11th-ranked Vols, led by Chris Lofton, JaJuan Smith and C.J. Watson, fell to the Wildcats 80-78.

A pregnant woman and their unborn baby, killed in a suspected case of “wrong place, wrong time.” Three members of the same family slain in their Scarborough home, allegedly at the hands of a son and brother with a bizarre criminal past. A glut of targeted shootings with possible gang connections, including the midday shooting of Marcus Gibson in their home in South Riverdale. Sixty-nine people were victims of homicide in Toronto in 2016, a sizable jump in total murders in the city compared with the past few years: 56 homicides in 2015, and 57 in both 2013 and 2014. The uptick in homicides, part of what Toronto police say is a broader trend across North America, still comes short of the numbers seen a decade ago. The tally reached 86 in 2007 and 80 in 2005.

Fatal shootings have been declining gradually since a spike in 2005, when 52 of 80 homicides were shootings. But Toronto police statistics show a marked increase in shootings last year over 2015. In 2016, there were 40 fatal shootings, up from 26 in 2015 and 27 in 2014. Shootings causing injuries have also seen a jump, from 132 in 2015 to 151 in 2016.

However, fatal stabbings decreased in 2016, with just nine compared with 18 in 2015.
In a recent interview, Chief Mark Saunders said they believe Toronto is still one of the safest cities in North America. “The sky is not falling,” they said. “Having said that, I still respect the loss of life and the fact that just one life lost is something that we take seriously.” Noting there is no simple fix to the “incredibly complex” problem, Saunders said officers are working to get the weapons off the street. They said 900 guns were seized in 2016. “We need to look at the system as a whole, and not just the enforcement piece. At the front end, we've got at-risk young men who have not yet put that gun in hand. What programs can we put in place to help prevent (their getting guns)? “At the back end, when they have made that mistake . . . right now we're just letting them out, and what are they going to do now that they've got a criminal record and they've got no hope? They are going to resort back to violence,” Saunders said. Emphasis must also be placed on stopping weapons from coming into the city at all, Saunders said. As reported by the Star, Toronto police sent a memo to city staff this summer, flagging serious “gaps” that have turned domestic firearms trafficking into a “very real problem in Canada.” Only a few years ago, approximately 70 per cent of guns used in Toronto crimes originated from the United States, and just 30 per cent were domestically sourced. According to the memo, those figures of illicit guns have now shifted to roughly 50/50; guns obtained domestically are either stolen from legal owners or obtained through “straw purchases,” when a licensed buyer sells a gun on the black market.

“The numbers change a little back and forth but domestically sourced guns have become more available, both hand guns and long guns,” reads the memo, dated July 22, 2016. Mayor John Tory last month sent a letter to Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, urging them to close an “obvious gap” in firearms regulation. “To put it simply, I want to get the guns out of the hands of those who choose to do harm and are hell-bent on disrupting our peaceful city,” Tory wrote. According to statistics compiled by the Star from police data and news reports, the average age of a homicide victim in 2016 was 35, the same as 2015. Ten of last year's homicide victims were women, among them Elana Fric-Shamji, a respected family doctor whose husband is charged with first-degree murder in their death; Sylvia Consuelo, who was brutally sexually assaulted, beaten and found dead in their Jamestown area apartment and Peggy Smith, a 61-year-old grandmother who police believe wasn't their killer's intended target. Four people died in interactions with Toronto police in 2016. Devon LaFleur, 30, Alex Wettlaufer, 21, and a still-unidentified man were shot dead by police. Rui Nabico, 31, died after a Toronto police officer used a Taser against him. The four deaths are under investigation by the Special Investigations Unit, the civilian police watchdog that probes deaths involving police. These deaths are not included in the 2016 homicide total.

ISLAMABAD - The establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs), under CPEC, is likely to face further delay as the federal government and provinces are still far away from the finalisation of the feasibility studies, it is learnt reliably here.
“Except Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has made some progress on the feasibility study on SEZs, the rest of the provinces are still in the preliminary stage, official sources told The Nation here Friday. The setting up of the SEZs is an important feature of CPEC which will help to attract foreign investment and will create jobs for the local people.
In a progress review meeting on the SEZs, the planning minister expressed serious concern over the delay in the feasibility study of SEZs and directed to complete the studies within scheduled time frame, the official said. The meeting was attended by senior officials from line ministries and provincial governments. On the occasion, the provincial authorities briefed the meeting about their respective SEZs.
“If you ask me, the percentage of feasibility work completed by the provinces, I will say that Punjab and Sindh are below 45 percent progress, while Baluchistan is around 30 percent and GB is 15 percent,” the official said. The federal government, which is supposed to establish two SEZs, is also not different from the provinces, the official said.
In 2016 it was decided that by June 2017 the provinces and federal government will complete the feasibility studies of their respective SEZs and it will be presented in the 7th JCC which is scheduled by the end of November or December. “I don't think that we will be able to take any advantage from the 7th JCC as we are not prepared and have not completed the homework on the SEZs,” the official maintained.
Meanwhile, a press release issued here stated that the Planning, Development & Reform Ahsan Iqbal has maintained that it should be a matter of deep concerns for all stakeholders if the progress on development of economic zones under CPEC is not made within the scheduled timeframe, instructing for ensuring tangible outcomes of Pakistan-China industrial cooperation.
The interior minister, who also has the additional charge of planning, directed all stakeholders to fast track the development of SEZs, complete land acquisition process and feasibilities. They instructed the line ministries and provincial governments to ensure concrete measures for provision of electricity, gas and other facilities to these SEZs.
“We need to transform these SEZs into an attractive destination for foreign investment”, said Ahsan, instructing provinces to finalise their incentives plan for SEZs, in addition to the incentives already announced by the federal government. The zone authorities should create a competitive environment for making this cooperation, a truly successful one, the minister said, emphasizing further to develop these zones on the basis of feasibly studies and locally available resources.
They further said that a model and smart industrial park be developed in Islamabad with consultation of Islamabad and Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce. The minister further instructed the provinces to opt for best and feasible financing model, ensuring maximum benefits from relocation of labour intensive industries from China to Asia and subsequent recreation of 85 million jobs.
Ahsan underlined need of vibrant Board of Investment (BOI) and asked the officials of BOI to prepare reform package in accordance with prevailing needs and circumstances. During the meeting, BOI officials briefed the participants regarding the visit of Chinese SEZs experts' group, scheduled in the second week of October. The experts would conduct training workshops besides holding meeting with Pakistan's experts on industrial development sector.
The minister instructed that all efforts be made to conduct meaningful workshops and meetings during the visit of Chinese Expert Group. They further issued instruction to undertake determined efforts regarding industrial cooperation for bringing out tangible outcomes prior to 7th JCC Meeting.
BOURNEMOUTH - A goal from Raheem Sterling and an own goal from Tyrone Mings gave Manchester City a 2-0 win against Bournemouth and lifted them from sixth to second place in the Premier League on a blustery Monday night at the Vitality Stadium.
Pep Guardiola's side closed the gap on Chelsea to eight points and kept alive their hopes of the title, despite their Spanish manager ruling out the possibility following their team's 4-0 defeat at Everton last month. But three league wins in a row have reignited City's season with FA Cup and Champions League games to come in the next eight days as Sergio Aguero issued a timely reminder of their attacking prowess after coming on as an early substitute for the injured Gabriel Jesus.
"We made a real performance. I am so pleased with how we did and especially the last 10-15 minutes, we did the right way to make the result with a thousand million passes," Guardiola told the BBC. They said they would only know the extent of Jesus' injury on Tuesday. "Hopefully it won't be for a long time -- I will pray tonight -- we will have to wait until tomorrow," said the 46-year-old, who refused to accept the title was still on as the gap to Chelsea they said was still 'massive'.
Their Bournemouth counterpart Eddie Howe has seen their side's form deteriorate since the turn of the year -- they are yet to win in 2017 and lie only six points above the relegation zone. "We have to be positive. We go into a break in the Premier League calendar and have to come back refreshed and ready to fight for our league survival," they told Sky Sports.
City fans hoping to see Jesus add to their scintillating start for the club were disappointed as the Brazilian lasted only 14 minutes before being replaced by Aguero after turning their ankle. It gave Aguero an opportunity to show some form amidst speculation they could be regarded as surplus to requirements with the arrival of Jesus.
The first real chance went to Bournemouth after 19 minutes.A swift one-two between Jack Wilshere and Jordon Ibe saw the latter through on goal but goalkeeper Willy Caballero smothered the ball with their legs. Bournemouth then suffered a blow when their captain, Simon Francis, who had been doubtful for the match, left the field to an injury.
City almost went ahead immediately after that when Leroy Sané crossed for Sterling whose shot was deflected onto the post by Steve Cook. Sterling could not believe their luck but they did not have long to dwell on their disappointment. Just three minutes later, Sane crossed again and this time Steve Cook deflected the ball into the path of Sterling who smashed in at the far post for their fifth Premier League goal against Bournemouth, the most they have scored against a single opponent.
Minutes later, Josh King thought they had equalised but referee Neil Swarbrick ruled out their goal for pulling John Stones' shirt in the build up. Bournemouth felt aggrieved though they had City rattled and, when Jack Wilshere also withdrew through injury, Howe replaced them with Benik Afobe, a striker as they sensed an opportunity.
Though City continued to impress on the break, with Sane in particular causing the Cherries problems, Bournemouth kept threatening.
Afobe passed to Harry Arter whose curling shot was tipped round the post by Caballero following some neat approach work from the home side.
However, City went down the other end and killed it off as a contest. Fernandinho fed Sterling down the City left and they bamboozled Adam Smith with a series of step-overs before crossing for Aguero who poked home via the toe of Mings.

Article body copy
In the closing days of the dinosaurs, about 70 million years ago, a small mammal scampered over the forest floor on an ancient island. Like most beasts of its time, this fuzzball was relatively diminutive—no larger than a rat. But there was something odd about this distant relative of modern-day mammals. Its domed head and surprisingly small brain were clues to how island life can dramatically alter an animal's evolution.
Scientists know about this Cretaceous critter thanks to a partial skeleton unveiled earlier this year by Zoltán Csiki-Sava, a paleontologist at the University of Bucharest in Romania, and their colleagues. The researchers described the species as Litovoi tholocephalos—meaning dome-skulled ruler.
Litovoi's importance to evolutionary history wasn't immediately apparent, Csiki-Sava says. When the fossilized mammal was discovered in Romania's Haţeg Basin in 2014, it seemed to be another example of an archaic type of rodent-like mammal called a multituberculate. The find was interesting because mammals are extremely rare in rocks this old, but at the same time, other multituberculates had already been found in the same deposit. Yet when Csiki-Sava and their colleagues examined the skull more closely using a CT scan, “we came to understand this specimen has more to offer than simply being well preserved,” they say.
What made Litovoi stand out was its braincase, which was much smaller than it should have been for its body size. This feature, along with the fact that Litovoi has not been found anywhere else, hints that this little mammal was an ancient beneficiary of an evolutionary phenomenon known as the island effect, the island rule, or Foster's Rule after biologist J. Bristol Foster who coined the concept in 1964.
As a scientific hypothesis, the basic definition of the island effect goes like this: islands are isolated areas that often result in unique evolutionary changes in the species that live on them. On islands, animals are often smaller than their mainland counterparts, adapted to their restricted space. The island of Flores in Indonesia, for example, is famous for once being home to pint-sized elephants and small prehistoric humans popularly known as Hobbits.
But the island effect also goes the other way, and typically small animals—usually free from the ravages of large predators—become huge. Between five and three million years ago, for instance, an enormous rabbit named Nuralagus rex lived on the Spanish island of Menorca.
Back in the time of Litovoi, what we now know as Romania was inundated by the sea. Small islands provided refuge to dinosaurs and other terrestrial species. Isolated, these species' evolutionary pathways took some strange turns.
Litovoi's disproportionately tiny brain, Csiki-Sava says, seems to be another example of the island effect.
“Brain reduction associated with island habitat was documented previously in hippos, goats, and even hominids,” they say. Brains use a lot of energy, so small ones are advantageous on islands where resources are often limited.
The discovery fits in with other animal species unearthed in Romania that also show the evolutionary signs of island life. Some dinosaurs from Cretaceous Romania, for instance, are dwarfed. Magyarosaurus, a long-necked, herbivorous titanosaur is one such species. Befitting the name, the largest titanosaurs grew as long as a blue whale. Romania's shrunken Magyarosaurus was no bigger than a cow.
Stranger still is Balaur bondoc. This carnivore is similar in size to its more famous cousin Velociraptor, but only has two fingers on each hand instead of three and a double set of hyper-extendable killing claws instead of the standard one.
If Litovoi's tiny brain is a result of the island effect, then it's a particularly important find. Csiki-Sava says that if it is, then the discovery pushes back the timeline of the first documented case of the island effect in mammals. It also shows that reducing in brain size, without a simultaneous reducing body size, is another way evolution might drive animals to respond to island life.
Litovoi's unique adaptations highlight something else. Mammals in the age of dinosaurs are often characterized as small, shrewlike insectivores that hid in the night until the reptilian reign of terror ended 66 million years ago. But a vast accumulation of fossils over the past few decades has added nuance to this narrative. It's fair to say that mammals did stay relatively small during the heyday of the dinosaurs, but they diversified into a variety of forms—from the prehistoric equivalents of raccoons and aardvarks, to mammal cousins that lived like beavers and flying squirrels.
Multituberculates such as Litovoi are part of that story. Oklahoma State University paleontologist Anne Weil dubs them “the most successful order of mammals to have lived, so far.”
Multituberculates flourished during the Mesozoic, evolving into species of a variety of sizes and occupying environments from forests to deserts. “Litovoi is further evidence of the kinds of specialization they were capable of,” Weil says. Mammalian expression showed that even in the era of dinosaur dominance, size wasn't everything.

They last pitched in the major leagues in 2015, when they made 24 appearances for the New York Yankees and finished 0-2 with a save and had a 5.66 ERA in 20 2/3 innings pitched.
The news was first reported by The Athletic.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11 (APP):The Editorial Board of the leading American newspaper the New York Times said on Sunday that anti-Muslim rhetoric and unprovoked attacks on Muslims have risen alarmingly under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
In an editorial titled “Hate Smears India's Symbol of Love, the Taj Mahal”, the NYT Editorial Board said the Hindu extremists have become a driving force in India who are so obsessed with demonizing Muslims that they are even discrediting the Taj Mahal, built by a Muslim Mughal Emperor.
The Taj Mahal was built by Shah Jahan as tomb to show their love for their wife Mumtaz Mahal and is considered as one of the wonders of the world and is a magnificent symbol of enduring love. According to the board, Taj Mahal is perhaps India's greatest cultural treasure and pre-eminent tourist attraction.
It attracts millions of tourists to this marvel which is carved with marble inscribed with verses from the Holy Quran. The Board said that it is this inscription of verses of the Holy Quran which is “exactly what the Hindu right finds so galling”.
In October, it was noticed that the Taj Mahal was omitted from the tourism brochure of the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the monument is located in the city of Agra. The UP is headed by the firebrand Hindu cleric Yogi Adityanath.
“Sangeet Som, a member of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, railed that the Taj Mahal was “a blot on Indian culture” built by “traitors.” And Mr. Som's party colleague Vinay Katiyar blustered, completely unglued from historical fact, that the Taj Mahal was actually “Tejo Mahal, Lord Shiva's temple,” referring to the Hindu god.”
Taj Mahal was restored on the brochure, following a visit of Mr. Adityanath to the site after they sensed that it would destroy the state's tourism revenue. Although, they resolved the problem and restored the Taj Mahal on the brochure, they grudgingly stated that the tomb was important because it “was built by the blood and sweat of Indian laborers”.
“Anti-Muslim rhetoric and unprovoked physical attacks on Muslims have risen alarmingly under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party, and Hindu hard-liners speak more and more boldly of an India where Muslim citizens are, if not hated enemies, mere guests who live at the sufferance of Hindus,” the NYT Editorial Board wrote in the editorial.
The editorial said that the past Wednesday was the 25th anniversary of the demolition of the 16th century Babri Mosque in Ayodhya by Hindu fanatics who claimed that it was built on the site of a Hindu temple.
“Subsequent rioting between Hindus and Muslims, which killed more than 2,000 people by some estimates, is a reminder of what Hindu zealotry can wreak,” the editorial said. India's Supreme Court last week began hearing on the fate of the site where Hindu hardliners vow they will rebuild a Hindu temple on the site of the ruined mosque.
“In this disturbing context, preserving the Taj Mahal is important, not only as a testament to the glories of India's syncretic past, but also as a pledge to an inclusive future,” the editorial concluded.

A sealant is a viscous material which penetrates by capillary action into a substrate where it is applied and provides a barrier to air, dust, liquids and others, from passing from one substrate to another. Sealants are corrosion resistant, insoluble in most media and have adhesion. The adhesion of sealants is slightly lower compared to adhesives. Sealants lie between high strength adhesives and low strength caulks and putties. However, they have higher elongation compared to adhesives. There are numerous types of sealants which are used across various industries such as building & construction, automobiles, rubber industry and marine applications among others.
A sealant fills gaps and voids, forms a physical barrier through adhesion and maintains sealing properties between two substrates. The growing automotive market is a key driver for the growth of sealants market. Sealants find numerous uses inside an automobile- they are used to fix the acoustic insulation parts in car doors, insulation matting, cladding of door panels, fixing the car upholstery and have several other uses in automobiles. They are used in places requiring moderate adhesion but high elongation. Sealants are formulated with elastomers which give them the required flexibility; they are also used to enhance the dielectric strength. However release of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous air pollutant emissions from automotive assembly is a major environmental concern surrounding sealants. The usage of water based sealants is expected to open new areas of opportunity for the market of automotive sealants in the coming years.

The market of sealants in the U.S and U.K is growing at a slow pace owing to the economic downturn and slow recovery from it. The market of sealants is growing exponentially in China and the Indian subcontinent due to the growing automobile manufacturing market in these countries.
Brazil is expected to be the new and upcoming automobile manufacturing hub. There is tremendous growth potential of sealants in Brazil in the coming years. The growth of the market is also attributable to technological advances such as additives which add special properties to sealants.

The market of automotive sealants is fragmented across the globe. There are numerous small, medium and large players in this market, which serve many markets and produce numerous sealant variants. There is a worldwide trend of concentration of this market through mergers and acquisition route. This market is expected to grow rapidly with improvement in technology and advances in material sciences. Some of the major players in this market include Dow Chemical Co, Henkel, Krayden Inc, 3M, Kommerling, Sika Group and Permatex among others.
LAHORE - Archbishop Sebastian Francis Shaw, condemning the brutal bomb attack on The Mall, has expressed their heartfelt condolences to the families of the police officers and other innocent people who lost their lives in this cowardly act of terrorism.
“Church mourns the victims of Monday's suicide blast on The Mall,” the bishop observed in a condolence meeting held at St Anthony's High School yesterday. In the meeting, also attended by the principal Shahid Ambrose Moghul, the participants held prayers for the blast victims.
“I would like to offer my sympathies to the unfortunate victims of this ruthless terrorist attack, and assure them that the Church will stand hand-in-hand with the affected families in this darkest hour,” they added.
The bishop asked the government to take a strict stand to eliminate terrorism, as loss of precious innocent lives is intolerable. They termed the terrorist attack as an ugly attempt to destabilise country aimed at creating an impression of unsafe place in the eyes of international community.
“We denounce every act of terrorism and violence in the country, while we urge the authorities to provide complete medical support to the victims.
The law-enforcement authorities must ensure stronger vigilance, as the blasts have jolted the whole the country,” Shahid Ambrose Moghul said in a statement.

(DREW ELLIS - Digital First Media) Auburn Hills Avondales Angelina Willis and Clawsons Jackie Hauser battle for a rebound during Fridays non-conference game. Avondale picked up a 49-28 victory at Clawson High School.
AUBURN HILLS >> After suffering its first conference loss last weekend, Auburn Hills Avondale High School girls basketball coach Phil Dawson was eager to see how their team would respond.
The Yellow Jackets passed the test with flying colors, completing a three-win week with a 49-28 victory at Clawson on Friday night.
I think maybe overconfidence got the best of us and Farmington came out ready to go. The challenge for us is we knew we had three tough games this week and we couldnt let the loss to Farmington get to us, Dawson said of their team, which also defeated Stoney Creek and Berkley this week. I was really proud of how the girls have responded this week.
Avondale started a bit slow, going scoreless for the first couple of minutes as Clawson established a 4-0 lead. However, the Jackets would answer with a 9-0 run to take a lead it wouldnt relinquish.

After pushing the lead to nine points early in the second quarter at 16-7, the Trojans would fight back to make it 21-17 at halftime.
We didnt give up a lot of possessions. We kept working and trying to find the space we needed on offense, Clawson coach Jenny Pintek said. Thats what Clawson basketball is about. We are trying to make something new out of every possession. The final score didnt show that, but our girls worked hard throughout.
The game turned in the second half when Avondale went on a 24-7 rally, using its team speed to get to the basket while also hitting some timely 3-pointers.
When we work the ball around and are patient on offense, we are pretty good, Dawson said. We have a lot of players that can score and we just need to work to get the open look and not settle for bad shots.
Leading the way for Avondale in the win was Olivia Russell, who had 21 points. Keiori Lee added 14 while Angelina Willis had six.
Avondale returns to action on Tuesday when it travels to Oak Park in hopes of maintaining its spot alongside Farmington atop the OAA Blue.
We have to be more consistent in what we do. We go through some stretches where we play outstanding and we show just how good we can be, Dawson said. But sometimes we have moments where we go into droughts with our effort and execution and we cant have those. Especially as we get to the big games and the postseason.
Clawson was led on the night by Shaniya Evans, who had 13 points. Justice Biddle and Jackie Hauser each added six points. The Trojans will look to get back on track on Wednesday, when they travel to LAnse Creuse. Fridays loss certainly hasnt been representative of the success Clawson has had this season, as the Trojans are 13-3 overall and 8-0 in the MAC.
These girls really communicate well and trust each other and that is very important in basketball, Pintek said of their team. I think that is why we have had success. Everyone on the team believes in each other and they play that way on the floor. We just need to continue to look at how we can grow and how we can get better.
COX'S BAZAR/DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh is deploying thousands of extra police to Rohingya refugee camps in the south, officials said, after a series of mostly unexplained killings that have sown fear among hundreds of thousands of people who have fled from neighbouring Myanmar.

Since August, when a military crackdown in Myanmar forced many of the Muslim minority to cross the border into Bangladesh and seek shelter in the crowded camps, 19 people, some of them community leaders, have been killed.
Police have made a number of arrests in connection with some of the killings, but say the motives often remain unclear.
Conducted after dark and often by groups of men wielding pistols, knives, and sticks, the killings have sent a chill through the camps, which are guarded by the Bangladesh army during the day but manned by fewer police officers at night.
A.K.M. Iqbal Hossain, police superintendent of the coastal town of Cox's Bazar under whose jurisdiction the camps fall, said a special force of roughly 2,400 men was being formed to guard the refugees.
A second senior officer, Superintendent Afrujul Haque Tutul, said police numbers were already being increased.
“We have 1,000 police officers right now for a million people, so you can imagine,” they said.
More than 700,000 Rohingya have taken shelter in Cox's Bazar district since August, joining thousands who were already living there, making it the world's largest and fastest growing refugee camp.
Even before the August exodus, there had been violence in the camps, which Bangladesh police and aid workers have previously blamed on a struggle for control of supplies to the camps.
STABBED 25 TIMES
The latest killing, of 35-year-old Arifullah, took place last month on a busy road outside the Balukhali camp, where they had been appointed a leader of thousands of refugees.
A group of men surrounded them on the evening of June 18, stabbing them at least 25 times, police said. A pool of blood stained the spot the next morning, and a crowd of refugees could be seen gathered around.

Police said three Rohingya men had been arrested over the killing of Arifullah, who spoke English, had worked for international agencies in Myanmar, and often met foreign delegates who visited the camps.
Their wife, who did not want to be named and asked Reuters not to disclose the location where they were interviewed because they feared attack, said Arifullah was a critic of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) – a militant group whose assaults on Myanmar security posts in August triggered the crackdown by the military.
The group says it is fighting for the rights of the Rohingya. Police said investigations into the murder were ongoing and they had not found links to ARSA.
A spokesperson for ARSA referred Reuters to its Jan. 31 statement that said other armed groups were responsible for “activities” at refugee camps and were using its name to malign its image.
The group said it did not attack civilians and would never carry out killings in the camps because its was thankful for Bangladesh's generosity in sheltering the refugees.
That statement was issued after the Jan. 19 killing of Yusuf, another English-speaking camp leader. Sitting on the mud floor of their shelter, Yusuf's wife Jamila said their husband had been watching a football match on their phone with their two sons when around a dozen men barged into their shelter in the Taingkhali camp carrying knives and pistols, shooting them twice.
They said police had urged them to file a case and name suspects, but they had refused, fearing retaliation, and because they did not want to leave their shelter for hours to go to court. “I'm scared for my children,” they said.
Details of Yusuf's killing were confirmed by police superintendent Tutul at the Cox's Bazar police station. They said the police investigation was hampered because the refugees were afraid to name suspects.
They said intelligence received so far suggested several of the killings, including those of Yusuf and Arifullah, were due to personal disputes refugees had brought from Myanmar.
Police have arrested about 300 Rohingya in cases involving killings, robberies and abductions in the camps since the August influx, Tutul said.
Camp leaders at Balukhali and Taingkhali said the army had appointed Rohingya volunteers to keep guard at night, but most had stopped working because they were not being paid.
Foreign officials said security inside the teeming camps was a worry. “What I hear from my colleagues is that is obviously a big concern,” Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said on a visit to the camps on Sunday.
“It is obvious that it is a big challenge when you have big numbers, poor conditions, cramped situations.”

If you're anything like me, summer holiday panic usually sets in somewhere around the end-of-year school concert and that stomach-dropping chat with another parent who tells you about that wonderful new Fijian resort they've booked for Christmas. Of course, if you are me, you also have the panic of knowing that if you don't book something today, you'll be spending the next few weeks sitting under your mother's carport, eating sun-warmed snags as your children wrestle with the sun-warmed hose – a holiday you've been known to previously sell as a ‘STAYCATION!'
Worried you've missed the boat on top summer deals for the Christmas holidays? Dilvin Yasa says there are plenty of great last-minute family holidays to be had – if you know where to look.
When I was a child, you only ever went to Canberra as punishment, but since the hipsters, their coffee machines and a multitude of Michelin-starred restaurants have moved in, our nation's capital has long since shaken off its ‘kill me now' tag and groomed itself into one of the hottest cities around.
I won't lie; this fear alone is enough to prompt me to book something quickly these days, but should you find yourself facing a similar situation (and you don't fancy dropping in at my mum's), you'll be pleased to know there are plenty of amazing family holiday destinations you can access with little-to-no planning.
For a start, it's probably more child-friendly than most, with a wealth of fun museums such as Questacon, National Museum of Australia and The National Dinosaur Museum , and it has a multitude of gargantuan outdoor spaces packed to the brim with activities such as kayaking at Burley Griffin, cycling Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, and riding the miniature steam train at Cockington Green Gardens . Add to that accommodation options that range from sleeping with a lion or brown bear just outside your window at Jamala Wildlife Lodge , to the bright and bold East Hotel , which offers families interconnecting Kids Studios with bunk beds, play tables and an Xbox 360.
We're pretty lucky in this country to have some of the best beaches in the world, so whe... READ MORE
Whether your idea of a good time is climbing a mountain or chilling down by the sea, we'... READ MORE
The cherry on top? Since Canberra is still considered on the up and up, you're likely to find some truly great last-minute deals through sites such as lastminute.com.au and booking.com
Road trippin'
Embrace those ‘character building' driving holidays of your youth and treat your own family to a similar experience (this time with air-con, water and a spare tyre) by taking advantage of super-low domestic fares and hiring a car at your destination.
With minimal planning, you can fly to Launceston, Tasmania, pick up a hire car from the airport and embark on a stunning driving holiday around the northern part of the state where the produce is mouth-watering, the scenery jaw-dropping and the activities such as Penny Royal Adventures, Cataract Gorge Chairlift and basin, Hollybank Treetops Adventure, and Tasmazia & The Village Of Lower Crackpot in Sheffield, suitable for young and old.
Fancy somewhere warmer? Take the well-trodden path between Sydney and Yamba (on the way to the Gold Coast), visiting all the ‘Big' things before eventually settling at a campground at Yuraygir National Park. Offering cliff-top sites overlooking stunning beaches, the park is located close enough to both towns to visit regularly, but is far enough that you're unlikely to be affected by summer crowds (and pricing).
For other holiday parks you can match with a driving holiday, check out Turu, Big4 Holiday Parks and Discovery Parks.
Kangaroo Island time
What's a guaranteed way to have the (last-minute) holiday of your dreams without having it crushed by crowds or surge pricing? You head somewhere many don't know too much about… somewhere like South Australia's spectacular Kangaroo Island.
Located 13 kilometres off the coast, Kangaroo Island is a wilderness wonderland where the seals, sea lions and yes, kangaroos, appear to outnumber the human population of some 4,500 by quite a bit. Simply hire a 4WD and earmark visiting the sea lions at Admirals Arch, enjoying a guided seal tour at Seal Bay Conservation Park, and feeding pelicans at Kingscote as ‘must dos'. Then rest your head at one of the many campgrounds scattered around the island, hire one of the waterfront private residences also readily available through sites such as Stayz or Airbnb, give yourself over to the ultimate luxury by checking in at LifeTime Private Retreats, or if your child is older than 10, at the stunning Southern Ocean Lodge.
The Great Barrier Reef alternative: Bundaberg
Going to the Great Barrier Reef for a last-minute summer holiday may not sound like a particularly good deal – until you realise the trick to successfully staking your claim on a palm-fringed beach is to dismiss the big ‘names' and instead look at neighbouring towns, which not only tend to be cheaper, but are at less risk of being booked out by the time you make the call.
Lady Musgrave already booked out? Look to staying at Bundaberg, AKA the launch pad to the Southern Great Barrier Reef. With the town as your base, you can take the kids to visit Mon Repos Beach – home to the largest turtle rookery in the South Pacific, enjoy the beauty of Lady Elliot Island where you can swim straight off the beach over the reef, and you can visit the charming towns of Childers and Gin Gin where you can eat your body weight in gorgeous fresh produce. And then, of course, there's the rum, but that's another story…
Tips for booking last-minute
Help yourself score a better deal over the school holidays by liking your favourite/preferred hotels on social media or signing up to their newsletters. Doing so will put you ahead of the queue for any last-minute flash sales (likewise for airfares).
Consider also house swapping through Aussie House Swap or by hiring a private rental at the destination of your choice. Not only will this work out to be cheaper, but you'll also (usually) have a full kitchen and laundry ready to go (reality stops for no one).
Download apps such as Skyscanner, which will not only notify you of price drops from airlines and online travel agents, but let you search through lists of suitable destinations for your desired travel period arranged by price, cheapest to most expensive.
CLEVELAND >> Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue is taking a leave of absence from the team to address health issues that have included chest pains and loss of sleep.
Lue said Monday in statement that tests have offered no conclusion about what the issue is and offered no timetable for their return. The coach said they feel they need to step away and focus on trying to establish a stronger and healthier foundation from which to coach the rest of the season.
While I have tried to work through it, the last thing I want is for it to affect the team. I am going to use this time to focus on a prescribed routine and medication, which has previously been difficult to start in the midst of a season, Lue said. My goal is to come out of it a stronger and healthier version of myself so I can continue to lead this team to the championship we are all working towards.
Associate head coach Larry Drew will run the team in Lues absence starting with Mondays home game against Milwaukee. Drew said they received a text message from Lue at 1:30 a.m. saying, Its your show.

LeBron James said they were informed of Lues decision at morning shootaround, saying it was probably well overdue.
I knew they were struggling, but they were never not himself. They were just dealing with it the best way they could, James said. Once they leave the gym and goes home, theres things we dont know, but they were the same every single day even though they were going through what they were going through.
A stress-filled season for the Cavs has taken a toll on the 40-year-old Lue, who led them to the 2016 NBA championship after taking over for David Blatt midway through that season. They are 40-29, third in the Eastern Conference, and have endured roster shake-ups, injuries and other distractions as they try to return to the NBA Finals.
Now they will play without their coach.
We all want great players, we all want the best teams, but with that comes a lot of pressure as well. And what Ty Lue has had to go through this year with that team, with the trades and the injuries and the pressure, its unrelenting, Denver coach Michael Malone said. So I hope that they get healthy and is able to get back in time for the playoffs and help that team win as many games as possible.
Lue spent the second half of Clevelands victory in Chicago on Saturday in the locker room because of an illness, the second time this season they left a game because they wasnt feeling well. The former NBA guard also sat one out against Chicago at home in December.
We know how difficult these circumstances are for Coach Lue and we support them totally in this focused approach to addressing their health issues, general manager Koby Altman said.
Drew, who coached the second half of Saturdays game, the finale of a six-game, 11-day road trip, spoke about Lue before Mondays contest.
Hes shown the warrior that they are, Drew said. If you would have left it up to them hed be sitting in this chair right now instead of me. Thats just who they are. They dont want to miss games. They dont want to miss practices. They want to be with the team, but there comes a point where you have to take a step back and assess things. This thing has been lingering just a little bit too long. T-Lue needs to step away and allow themselves to heal before joining the team.
Drew has previous head coaching experience with Atlanta and Milwaukee.
Charlotte coach Steve Clifford also left their team to address their health this season. They took six weeks off. Medical tests revealed that the 56-year-old Clifford did not have any internal problems, but the doctors diagnosis was the coach was suffering from severe sleep deprivation .
Just as All-Star forward Kevin Love returned from a broken hand Monday, the Cavaliers will have to go an undetermined length of time without Lue. James was asked how their absence would impact the team.
Were going to find out, they said. Its tough. Its like losing one of your best players, a guy thats pretty much the captain of our ship who has run the team the last three years. Everyone had to step up. We have coaches in place who are ready for that challenge. We have to do our jobs as players as well.

Michigan native Erik Jones is showing great speed in their No. 77 Toyota Camry for Furniture Row Racing in their rookie season in the Monster Energy Cup series.
Jones, a 21-year-old graduate of Swartz Creek, is quickly finding their way while being teammates with Martin Truex Jr., who is the series points leader with two wins this season.
Jones finished seventh in the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte over Memorial Day weekend, then placed third this past Sunday at Pocono for their first Cup podium finish.
No doubt, there's a big difference from the Xfinity series, in which Jones competed last June at MIS, but they are making a strong transition heading into this Sunday's Firekeepers 400 at the two-mile superspeedway at MIS.
“It's been a tough transition, the Cup series is a lot different, much more competitive, much bigger step than going to Xfinity series,” Jones said. “I've just been trying to learn more about these race cars, how to put yourself in a good position to be there at the end, that's been probably the biggest challenge overall. Just being a rookie driver, rookie team, we're trying to all learn together still and get better and better, just improve every week.”
Jones and their crew have done just that with the podium finish at Pocono.
“You want to run well. and at Pocono it was the first race I felt like we were really in contention at the end and had a shot at it which was really cool,” Jones said. “Hopefully, we can get some more of that coming up here. It definitely gave a boost to everyone's confidence and shows that maybe we can win some of these races.”
Jones enjoys coming to Michigan and loves running at MIS.
“You always look forward to going back and race there since it gives some friends and family members who can't travel to come out and get the chance to watch me,” pointed out Jones who won the Camping World Truck series title in 2015.
“I've been there (MIS) a few times in the Trucks and Xfinity. It's still pretty narrow, only a few lanes, but still puts on a good show. It's kind of hard at times to get through traffic, get the runs where you want to, but I think it's a pretty racey track and it gets better every year. It's just fun to go out and kind of carry that speed that you have there. It's one of the fastest tracks we get to go to so it's kind of fun.”
Jones' trip to MIS was anything but fun last June, when they announced the death of their father, Dave Jones, who played a major role in their career. They took to the track just days after their father's death and finished fourth.
Jones' father was there to watch them make their rapid rise in NASCAR, which included three Cup races subbing for Joe Gibbs Racing in 2015, and actually leading at Kansas while subbing for Kyle Busch.
Now, Jones has a quality teammate in Truex.
“It's been nice to have a guy who is a veteran in the Cup series to be able to help me out,” Jones said. “They're fast every weekend so it's nice to just have another team there that we can baseline ourselves off of. We have used that and it's been helpful so it's nice to have a guy with that kind of experience.”
Jones said last Friday at Pocono they had big plans for this week, saying they planned to have dinner with their 85-old-year grandfather, then hang out with their friends who are Oakland University students.
However, Jones' travel plans were pushed back, resulting in them arriving Tuesday evening in Michigan with a test session in a Late Model car planned for Wednesday.
Still, Jones said it will feel good to be back home after a busy few months to start the season.

HELSINKI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Finnish tyre maker Nokian Tyres reported on Friday rising quarterly profits thanks to growth in North America and Europe.
Nokian, which has a large plant in Russia and a smaller one in Finland, said fourth-quarter operating profit rose 13 percent from a year earlier to 122.6 million euros ($153.1 million), roughly in line with analysts' average expectation of 121 million euros in a Reuters poll. Nokian said it expected growing sales and profits for this year, adding that raw material costs should be on the 2017 level and that it will be helped by its recent factory expansion in Russia.

Desmond and the Clan …. A true reflection of Sri Lanka's rich heritage of musical talent Vintage performance at the Grand on Princes By TREVINE RODRIGO IN MELBOURNE It's little wonder when you hear bands of the caliber of Desmond and the Clan who dominated the music scene in Sri Lanka many decades ago, that the newer bands of today have had to strive to be as good or even better to gain acceptance and recognition from music lovers these days. In a master stroke that was hatched as an idea by Sri Lanka's versatile icon of many decades, Desmond De Silva in consultation with wife and event coordinator Phyllis managed to rope in their former band mates for a tour to Australia and they gave music lovers in Sydney and Melbourne a fantastic show that will be long remembered by those fortunate to be there. To paraphrase an old adage, “They came, they saw and they conquered” Australia with their exceptional musical prowess. Missing from the original set up was master drummer, the late Harris Jurangpathy, whose place was filled with aplomb by Nimal Punchihewa from Desmoind's Australian band the ‘Impressions'. They played to sell-out crowds in Sydney and then announced themselves in no uncertain manner at the new place to be in Melbourne, The Library in Clayton, before delivering their versatile best to an appreciative albeit moderate crowd (Four functions in Melbourne that night), before parting ways and heading back to different parts of the globe where they now reside. Desmond and the Clan ruled the waves in Sri Lanka during their heyday in an era when music was churned out on instruments with less sophistication and only the extremely gifted could survive the lofty critics of the time whose judgement could be drilling and hard to appease at most times. They came together in Sydney, spent minimal time resynching their past, and then put on a masterpiece for a performance which brought out an ingenious array of life- like performances of some of the best musicians in the world from different eras. The Melbourne performance at the beautiful Grand on Princes showcased the versality of this wonderful band. For men of their vintage, they have matured like a good wine and proved that age has certainly not wearied them. Chuti Padmaperuma who began their musical career as a piano accordionist and played keyboards with some of the best musical setups at the time such as Gabo and the Breakaways, Flame and the Oceanites. They have entertained audiences in Europe mainly, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greenlands, Italy, Germany and Austria before returning to Sri Lanka where they now reside after a stint in the Maldives. They have now expanded their talents to playing, Keyboards, guitar, Sax, Trumpet and Panpipes. Kitsiri Abeywickrema was an absolute delight to watch backing their exceptional guitar work with acts such as Michael Jackson and Tina Turner which had the crowd enthralled. They have had a wide connection with some of the leading musicians such as Joey Lewis before settling in with Desmond and the Clan which toured and made a big impression in Europe mainly, Norway, Sweden and Germany. It seemed through the night that the versatility of the band knew no bounds as Tony Fernando bass and Elvis and Elton John impersonations, Susantha Perera Sax, Keyboards and vocals and then the maestro himself, Desmond De Silva stepped up by blowing everyone away with their rendition of the Bee Gees, Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin which was as authentic as you would ever wish to see. Among the crowd in Melbourne was former Red Dragons lead guitarist Chris VanCyulenberg in raptures labelling the band's performance as ‘World Class' and no one on the dance floor appeared to be in argument with him. Desmond and the Clan certainly did not disappoint the high expectation of them and no sooner had they wound up their commitments, plans were soon afoot to have them back in Australia in the not too distant future. Their next gig cannot come soon enough.
BOGOTA:- At least 36 people were injured after a grenade detonated inside a nightclub in the Colombian town of San Pedro, officials have said. Two of the injured were hospitalized at an intensive care unit in the town, which is located in Valle del Cauca state. Local police said the attack late Saturday may have targeted the owners of the establishment, although authorities said there are no known threat against them. Police are also investigating whether the attack was provoked by a rivalry between warring drug traffickers in the area. AFP
FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- The New York Jets released wide receiver Eric Decker, in part, to create opportunities for two draft picks, ArDarius Stewart and Chad Hansen. One problem: Stewart and Hansen are injured. In Stewart's case, he's recovering from surgery. Two, actually.
Stewart, a third-round pick from Alabama, underwent groin and thumb surgeries over the past two weeks, coach Todd Bowles said Wednesday. Bowles said Stewart suffered the injuries before they arrived to the Jets, yet they participated in the rookie minicamp in early May. They dealt with a sprained knee last season at Alabama, but there were no reports of groin and thumb injuries.
Bowles said Stewart "should be good to go" for training camp on July 29. But even if he's cleared to practice, Stewart will be behind from a conditioning standpoint. He'll also be playing catch-up in terms of the mental aspect, trying to absorb the offense after sitting for the entire spring.
Receivers coach Karl Dorrell downplayed the impact of the injury, saying, "I don't think the transition from when they start to run and play and practice will be far off the mark. It's just a matter of getting back in shape and tuning themselves up."
Hansen, a fourth-round pick from Cal, left practice on Tuesday with a knee injury and they didn't practice on Wednesday. Bowles didn't provide any details.
Right now, the receiving corps is beat up. Quincy Enunwa (shoulder/neck) also is sitting out, which means plenty of work for Robby Anderson, Jalin Marshall, Charone Peake and Myles White.
No, this isn't the Greatest Show on Turf 2.0.
"It's a great challenge for me," Dorrell said. "I'm excited for it, I accept the challenge. We're going to put out a good group of guys that I think will be hungry and feisty."
Dear Amy: My boyfriend and I have been on/off for the last five years.
During the time we were apart, they had another girlfriend. I didn't know about them They and I maintained a “friends with benefits” relationship during our breaks.
After I became pregnant with their child, I found out that they were very serious. I learned that they were pregnant, too. Our sons were born nine days apart.
They are no longer together, and they and I are trying to work things out, but I can't seem to let their relationship go.
I know that Facebook isn't “life,” but it bothers me that their entire relationship was broadcast on FB, but they won't even acknowledge us as being in a relationship.
They have never posted a picture of us or of our son.
They say he's ashamed of themselves (not of me), but I can't help but feel like he's not being truthful. I think he's ashamed of me.
They tell me all the time: “You're not her,” which makes me feel like they wish they aren't with me. They say I'm being insecure, and that he's never going to care about Facebook.
I just don't get why they could care about their Facebook status when they were with her, but not with me?
Am I being stupid?
— Worried
Dear Worried: When you ask me if you're being “stupid,” you run the risk of supplying me with a descriptor I'd rather not apply to a woman with a young child. However, this whole situation is unfortunate — because Rome is burning and you're worried about your Facebook status.
I do agree that this status is a sign of where your guy's priorities are, and while I'm not inclined to side with him, I do appreciate their embarrassment over fathering two babies (days apart) with two different women. Yes, they should feel embarrassed. They deceived both women (I imagine), and now their ability to be a good parent to both of their sons is compromised because one baby's mother is insecure and threatened by the other. This impedes their ability to be present in their sons' lives.
Your guy is not in charge of Facebook. You should post whatever photos you want the world to see. When people start to realize that your partner has two sons the same age with different women, they (and you) will face some questions.
Please understand that parenthood will not magically change your guy's character. You should get all of your legal, custodial and financial ducks in a row regarding the child, encourage this man to be a good father to both of their children, but understand that they may not intend to lead a monogamous life.
Dear Amy: My “adult” 23-year-old son is home for the holidays.
They lead a more liberal lifestyle than my husband and me, and suffice it to say not only do our politics not match up, but neither do our hygiene practices.
To be blunt, their BO is killing us! I didn't raise them this way and I absolutely can't stand it.
I just can't embrace not showering daily and not using a daily dose of antiperspirant.
How do you address an awkward and difficult topic with a person who is also awkward and difficult?
— Mother of the Smelly Kid
Dear Mother: I assume you have heard the term “adulting.” This is a recently minted verb to describe the process that people in their 20s are now undertaking to finally exit their lengthy childhoods. Adulting refers to assuming some life skills, such as doing dishes, paying bills, and — yes, cleaning oneself.
I'm assuming that you did teach your son these skills, but your fear of mentioning this now indicates that you are actually afraid to relate to them both as a parent and as a fellow adult.
(This doesn't have anything to do with your politics — or theirs — by the way.)
Tell your son, “We love having you home. But you've got to wash yourself — and your clothes — while you're here. Let me show you how to use the washer, and let's put in a load.”
Dear Readers: My own life is probably a lot like yours. I've experienced poverty, prosperity, marriage, divorce, remarriage, step-parenting, caretaking, loss and grief. If you've ever been curious about the life behind the advice column, I hope you'll consider picking up my memoir, “Strangers Tend to Tell Me Things: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and Coming Home.” (2017, Hachette).
MILAN (Reuters) - Inter Milan stayed top of Serie A and unbeaten after 16 games after surviving their toughest test of the season by holding champions Juventus to a 0-0 draw in Turin on Saturday.

Juve created more chances, but were foiled by Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic or their own poor finishing in a Derby d‘Italia that was always intriguing but never quite caught fire.
Cagliari survived a freak sequence of first-half injuries to draw 2-2 at home to Sampdoria, helped by an extraordinary goal where Samp goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano's clearance hit Diego Farias and flew into the net.
Inter lead the standings with 40 points from 16 games, two ahead of Napoli, who host Fiorentina on Sunday, and Juventus.
Juve, who ended Napoli's unbeaten start with a 1-0 away win one week ago, completed their fifth game without conceding a goal in all competitions and failed to score for the first time in 45 Serie A matches - a run stretching back to October last year.
“There were moments in the second half when we lost the ball too often for a team of our quality,” said Inter coach Luciano Spalletti. “We have the potential to do more, but sometimes tonight it seemed we were not angry enough and we got complacent.”
Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri dropped off-form playmaker Paulo Dybala and was without injured goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon whose place was taken by Wojciech Szczesny.
Handanovic rescued Inter after seven minutes with a superb save to push away a Mario Mandzukic volley before Miranda cleared the rebound off the line.

Mandzukic was close again just before halftime when they headed against the crossbar from Juan Cuadrado's cross but Inter enjoyed long spells of possession in between.
Juve had more of a grip in the second half with Cuadrado causing all sorts of trouble on the wing.
Handanovic tipped a Cuadrado header over the bar and had to make a difficult save from Kwadwo Asamoah's swerving drive, while in another attack Sami Khedira drove the ball wide with Handanovic out of theirs ground.

Gonzalo Higuain also had a chance for Juve but sent their shot wildly over the bar from the edge of the area.
Cagliari hit back from 2-0 down to hold Sampdoria 2-2 despite suffering extraordinary bad luck.
Goalkeeper Rafael was injured in the warm-up and replaced by Alessio Cragno, then Luca Ceppitelli went off in the fourth minute, Paolo Farago in the 33rd and Daniele Dessena in the 40th, all with injuries.
In between, Fabio Quagliarella scored twice in eight minutes to put Sampdoria in charge.
However, fortune smiled on the Sardinians early in the second half when Viviano hit a clearance straight at Diego Farias and the ball flew into net from 20 metres with the Cagliari player seemingly knowing nothing about it.
Leonardo Pavoletti headed the equaliser and Samp were grateful to come away with a point after a late flurry from the hosts.
Call of Duty: WWII is one of the most anticipated titles of the year; after three years of jet-packing the franchise returns to its roots of boots-on-the-ground action.
On the heels of the CWL Champs tournament (congratulations, Optic Gaming!), Activision and Sledgehammer have announced that the private beta for CoD: WWII will go live on August 25, and have concurrently released a trailer for the multiplayer beta.
The beta will be available on PS4, and will include some of the same content we saw at E3 this year, including three maps and a new game mode called War Mode.

While the conclusion of the Stanley Cup Playoffs is still close to two months away, the Anaheim Ducks' 2017-18 season is over after an embarrassing first-round sweep at the hands of the San Jose Sharks. Injuries and a number of systematic issues contributed to the Ducks' demise, so this offseason will be about looking for ways to rectify the latter.
Here are some potential paths the Ducks could consider venturing down in this unique and important offseason.
Ducks GM Murray Sheds Light on Future
Carlyle to Be Retained?
After a rough postseason that saw the Ducks win zero games and manage just four goals, starting by looking at bench boss Randy Carlyle is warranted. Given the way Anaheim spiraled out of control and completely lost its focus and poise for much of the series against San Jose, a culture change is something the organization might need to consider.
Nevertheless, all indications are that Carlyle will be back behind the bench for the Ducks next season. General manager Bob Murray is electing to take the view that the team overachieved given its injuries and first-half record. Murray was proud of how the Ducks rallied late in the year to not only secure a playoff spot, but also home-ice advantage in the first round as the No. 2 seed in the Pacific Division.
“In all honesty, I thought they did way better than I thought they were going to do. To get to where we finished, (tied for) eighth in the league in points, I never thought that.” -Ducks GM Bob Murray
That is indeed commendable and would be the completely correct takeaway even if the Ducks had lost a hard-fought first-round series with a decent showing. But the manner in which they were dismantled and embarrassed while failing to maintain their composure illuminated the need for the club to start fresh. They need to play a style that focuses less on physicality, retribution, and intimidation, and more on speed, skill, creativity, and mental toughness—something the Sharks shattered all too easily.
Ducks Need a New Style
Murray recognizes the importance of such a revamped style.
“We just played a team that was way faster than us,” Murray said on breakup day. “And they played the game faster than us.”
“Are Logan Couture and Joe Pavelski really fast skaters? Are they?” Murray asked, pointing out that team speed is not necessarily the same thing as individual player speed. “I had one of them in Team Canada. No. They're good hockey players. But if your team plays fast, you can make players faster. And that's the first thing that has to be addressed around here.”
Bringing in a new coach would be a huge initial step in making that change, but it does not seem as though Murray is ready to pull the trigger (even though they already have with respect to assistant coach Trent Yawney, who oversaw the team's defensemen). Carlyle has had a lot of success in the NHL, including a Stanley Cup championship in 2007 in their first stint with the Ducks. They also took the team to the Western Conference Final last season and thus seemed to be a good fit.
But things can change quickly. Now, it appears the Ducks are best suited to move in a new direction and completely redefine the way they play in the modern and ever-evolving NHL. The only hang-up is that Murray does not appear to be on board just yet with respect to a coaching change, even though they see the need for the team to adopt a new systematic approach.
If Murray is not ready to relieve Carlyle of their coaching duties, he'll have to trust that Carlyle will demonstrate an ability to adapt. Then, even though Murray's comments about team speed versus individual speed seem to contradict the notion of a roster overhaul, they will inevitably have to make at least a few minor roster changes purely based on the realities of every offseason.
Ducks' Pending Free Agents
On the blue line, Anaheim will likely get younger on the bottom pair since veterans Francois Beauchemin and Kevin Bieksa are on their way out. Beauchemin, whose contract is up, has already announced their plans for retirement. The Ducks will also see Bieksa's bloated $4-million average annual value (AAV) come off the books. They saw limited action down the stretch and in the postseason, and their exit-interview comments all but confirmed that they will not return to Anaheim.
The team's remaining unrestricted free agents (UFAs) at the NHL level are Antoine Vermette, J.T. Brown, Derek Grant, and late-season acquisitions Chris Kelly and Jason Chimera. There is also goaltender Reto Berra, who spent most of the year in the AHL but filled in for the big club at times when John Gibson or Ryan Miller were nursing injuries. Forward Jared Boll, who eventually found themselves in the minors after appearing in 10 games for the Ducks this season, is also a UFA.
It seems unlikely that the 35-year-old Vermette, whose playing time dwindled as the season wore on, will be brought back. Ditto for Kelly (37) and Chimera (38). These would be the right moves for a team that could use more youth.
Brown, 27, could be someone the Ducks consider retaining. Grant, 28, would seem less likely than Brown to return, even though they played the best hockey of their fragmented NHL career this year. Keeping them for additional depth, even if some of their action is in the minors, might be a nice insurance policy for a Ducks team that is no stranger to the injury bug. The 31-year-old Berra would also still provide value in the same role they had this season. Boll, on the other hand, should not be back.
Meanwhile, Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie, each 22 years old, are restricted free agents (RFAs). They are each due a raise from their entry-level contracts (ELCs), which Kase earned with an excellent, breakout season that saw them score 20 goals in 66 regular-season games.
Ritchie, the 10th overall pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, also seemed primed for a breakout after a 28-point season (14 goals and 14 assists) in 2016-17. Alas, they were unable to build on that production, posting just 27 points (including only 10 goals) this season. He's still young, but given their lack of development this season and their proclivity for unnecessary minor penalties, he's someone the Ducks should possibly consider dangling in the trade market, especially as part of a package for a more established, left-shooting scoring winger if they do not acquire one in free agency (more on that in a bit). A trade of Ritchie might not have to happen this season, either. For him, a short-term bridge deal seems more appropriate than a long-term commitment at this point.
Potential New Faces for Ducks
Prospects Who Could Make the Jump
Assuming some of these departures become official, the Ducks will have some positions to fill but some cap space with which to play. At the conclusion of the regular season, the Ducks had about $3 million in cap space, even with the close-to-being-very-problematic expensive long-term contracts for Ryan Getlzaf, Corey Perry, and Ryan Kesler. Bieksa's contract coming off the books should negate the total increase from the raises for Kase and Ritchie, while the departures of Beauchemin and others, plus a presumed increase to the cap, would give Anaheim even more room.
Even with that space, the Ducks can first look to some internal candidates to fill some of their open spots. Troy Terry, who signed an entry-level contract with the Ducks right after their college season at the University of Denver, should also have an inside track at a roster spot after getting a quick taste of NHL action this season. Sam Steel, a 20-year-old center who has posted a combined 214 points in 120 games for the WHL's Regina Pats over the past two seasons, is ready to move on from junior hockey and could jump straight to the NHL to fill a bottom-six role. In addition, developing power-forward and Max Jones, 20, could be ready to challenge for a role with Anaheim. Steel and Jones were both late first-round picks of the Ducks in 2016, and now they might be on the cusp of cracking the NHL.
Defenseman Jacob Larsson seemed poised to challenge for a roster spot this season but ultimately did not make the cut. That was the beginning of what evolved into a trying season for one of Anaheim's top prospects—one where they saw several other AHLers get a chance with the injury-plagued Ducks before him. They were called up before Game 4 against the Sharks but did not suit up.
“It's been a lot of injuries this season,” said the 20-year-old Larsson, whose season was marred by a difficult recovery from knee surgery that took place about a year ago, in addition to other ailments along the way. “So it's been in and out all the time. I'm not really happy with the season and how it went. I just need to continue doing rehab. Hopefully I have a good summer and come back better next year.”
Next season presents a prime opportunity for Larsson to establish themselves as a full-time NHLer. Perhaps, too, 24-year-old Andy Welinski will get more of a regular shot in the Ducks' lineup after seeing some action the postseason while Cam Fowler was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Marcus Pettersson also appears to be ready for a full-time gig after becoming a mainstay following their call-up in February. All of these players should have a legitimate chance to earn a third-pairing role behind top-four defenders Fowler, Hampus Lindholm, Josh Manson, and Brandon Montour.
Possible Free-Agent Targets
Beyond their in-house candidates, the Ducks could also look to supplement via free agency.
On defense, 28-year-old John Carlson will be the top player available unless they strike a new deal with the Washington Capitals prior to hitting the open market on July 1. He'll command a major contract, likely north of $6.5 million per season over a long term, so that's probably not the type of move the Ducks need to be making at this stage. Beyond Carlson and 32-year-old Mike Green, though, most of the remaining defensemen on the market are depth players who would cost much more than any of the youngsters Anaheim could plug in for likely equal if not better efficacy.
Up front is where the Ducks might want to make a more notable UFA signing. James van Riemsdyk, who will be 29 by the time next season starts, is a solid left wing who is good for 25-30 goals a year and actually hit a career-high 36 this season. The Toronto Maple Leafs will likely be unable to afford them given their cap situation and need to lock up RFA William Nylander this offseason before Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner next offseason. van Riemsdyk will be coming off an AAV of $4.25 million, so he'll likely get a bit more than that on the open market, but they are the type of bigger-ticket player who would be a better fit for the Ducks right now than someone like Carlson.
Beyond van Riemsdyk, James Neal could be an interesting consideration if they get to UFA status on July 1. So too could Josh Bailey of the New York Islanders, though it remains to be seen if he'll be as productive as they suddenly are this season if they are no longer playing alongside John Tavares (and before you ask, no, Tavares—the top pending UFA in this year's class—is likely not a viable option for the Ducks). Then there's Evander Kane, who the Ducks saw go to the San Jose Sharks at the trade deadline before they contributed to Anaheim's ugly postseason demise. They seem to be a good fit in San Jose, but if they do not re-sign there, he's someone for the Ducks to consider.
Other options who should prove to be more cost-effective include one-time Ducks David Perron (although they are another right-handed shot) and Patrick Maroon. Michael Grabner, Leo Komarov, and Antoine Roussel are also names the Ducks might look at, although the latter two are better characterized as agitators and energizers than true scoring threats.
Murray and the Ducks might not end up making a huge splash, but the inevitable turnover of players from this year's club should lead to a much-needed infusion of youth. That and an updated, speed-based style of play will be the keys to improvement for an Anaheim club that needs to be careful but purposeful with its decisions in order to remain a contender.
Toyota has issued a recall for 645,000 vehicles, with 49,000 in the US alone, due to an electrical issue involving the airbags. In short, the airbags may not deploy as they should in a crash. However, the recall is limited to just three models, all of which happen to be some of the Japanese automaker's best-sellers: the 2016 Prius and Lexus RX, and the 2015-2016 Lexus NX. Toyota claims an open circuit could occur over time in the airbag systems.

Ridley Scott's new series “Strange Angel,” the fourth season of Dwayne Johnson's “Ballers,” and nine other TV projects have been selected for a total of $69 million in California production tax credits.
The projects were announced Monday by the state film commission in the latest round of its Film & TV Tax Credit Program 2.0. The 11 projects are expected to spend an estimated $339 million in qualified expenditures (defined as wages paid to below-the-line workers and payments to in-state vendors) and will employ nearly 1,500 cast members and more than 2,200 crew.
The new TV series include Scott's “Strange Angel” (CBS Studios), “The Rookie” (Touchstone Television Productions), “Untitled Peacock Project” (Hop Skip & Jump Productions), and Mark Burnett's “Untitled Old Story Pictures Project” (Old Story Pictures).
“Television drives much of the industry's long-term employment and economic activity, so we're gratified to see the tax credit program help keep so much TV production here at home,” said California Film Commission executive director Amy Lemisch. “Tens of thousands of cast and crew members, as well as support service vendors, are working in California on TV projects thanks to the expanded tax credit program.”
Related 'Insecure,' 'Ballers' Renewed at HBO 'Captain Marvel' Among Big-Budget Films to Receive California Production Tax Credit
Lemisch also pointed to data released Nov. 30 by FilmL.A., which showed that soundstages in its jurisdiction have an average occupancy rate of 96% with nearly 75% of utilization attributed to scripted TV series. Other conditionally approved projects in the current TV allocation round include three pilots (“Euphoria,” “Harmony,” and “Less Than Zero”), and three other recurring series (“S.W.A.T.,” “Shooter,” and “The Orville”) that are already in the tax credit program and have been renewed for another season of in-state production.
The commission said Monday that a total of 52 TV projects have been accepted into Program 2.0 since it launched in 2015. The 2015-16 fiscal year marked a major expansion for the tax credit program, aimed at halting the erosion of California-based production to states with bigger incentives, such as Georgia and New York. The annual allocation rose from $100 million to $330 million, and applications are ranked on how many jobs they will produce, rather than being selected by lottery.
The program expansion, enacted in 2014 by California lawmakers, covers five years and $1.55 billion in tax credits. The credit is set at 20%, but producers are eligible for an additional 5% “uplift” if they shoot outside the L.A. zone, commit to music scoring or music track recording in the state, or to do visual effects in California.
NBC's drama “Timeless” announced in June that it was shifting production for its second season from Vancouver to California — the 12th TV series to relocate to California in order to receive the state's production tax credit. “Timeless” joined three other TV series (“Lucifer,” “Legion,” and “Mistresses”) to relocate from Canada to California under the commission's Program 2.0.
The expansion of the program also included a provision for big-budget studio movies to apply for the credit. Disney's “Wrinkle in Time” was the first title to receive the allocation. The California Film Commission, which administers the program, selected “Call of the Wild” and Quentin Tarantino's upcoming Charles Manson movie as recipients of the state's production tax credit on Nov. 20. They join other big-budget projects for California, including “Captain Marvel,” “Island Plaza,” “Midway,” “Ad Astra,” and “Bumblebee.”
DERA GHAZI KHAN/HAFIZABAD-Veterinary doctors protested against bigwigs of Health Department allegedly for forcing them to prescribe medicines of specific companies here on Wednesday.
They took out a rally under the auspices of Veterinary Doctors Association (VDA) which started from Civil Veterinary Hospital and culminated at Kutchehry Chowk. The participants were carrying banners as well as placards inscribed with their demands and they also shouted slogans against the high-ups of the department.
Addressing the protesters, speakers alleged that veterinary officers are being forced to prescribe medicines of particular companies allegedly to boost their sale in market. They also expressed concerns over huge amount of stock of those companies at hospital.
VDA president Dr Asif Rasool Buzdar, vice president Dr Arif Rizwan, general secretary Sajjad Sultan and finance secretary Dr Asif Naseem demanded action against the high-ups who are pressurising them. They said they cannot be forced to promote products of private companies and no one can pressurise them for the purpose. They also announced province-wide protest on June 17 if demands are not met.
In Hafizabad, veterinary doctors and para-veterinary staff observed strike and took out a rally from Fawara Chowk to Hafizabad Press Club for acceptance of their demands. They said they are forced to sell “wanda,” and “choker” (cattle food) besides their official duty which tarnishes their image. They also demanded increase in wages and up-gradation of service structure of all the employees.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- Agent Scott Boras is going straight to the top in their quest to find a home for Jake Arrieta.
Boras said Monday that they have sent a 75-page binder exclusively to MLB owners on behalf of Arrieta, who hit the open market alongside Yu Darvish as the most coveted free-agent starter this winter.
Over the past three seasons with the Chicago Cubs, Arrieta is 54-24 with a 2.71 ERA, second only to the Los Angeles Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw in that span. One MLB executive told ESPN he's under the impression Boras is seeking a long-term contract in the $200 million range for Arrieta, but Boras said they have not set any specific parameters with teams.
"I don't put values on anything,'' Boras said from the MLB winter meetings. "I just look at performance. I look at the marketplace and say, 'How do they stack up against the top pitchers in the game, and why?' I am not the purchaser. I am not the check writer. I am merely someone who talks about the performance value.
"I give them all the book, and the onion starts to peel. And all of a sudden there's only a small group left who do what [Justin] Verlander, Arrieta and [Max] Scherzer do."

Boras' promotional binders and penchant for dealing directly with owners have helped define their operating strategy with their elite clients through the years. One baseball insider, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Boras has become more motivated to bypass front offices and go straight to the top in recent years because so few general managers are authorized to make nine-figure deals.
"Scott's big thing is to show these owners that it's good business to sign their players,'' the person said. "I think he's doing it more now because they had so much success with the Tigers and the Nationals.''
Over a span of several years, Boras struck deals of $100-million plus with the Lerner family in Washington and the late Mike Ilitch in Detroit.
A big league general manager, who also requested anonymity, questioned whether Boras' approach is as effective as it once was with owners. They also said some of their peers aren't fans of Boras' strategy of going straight to ownership because "it presumes we don't communicate with our owners.''
Another GM told ESPN that the approach generates "more of an eye roll at this point'' than a strong reaction in front offices.
While Boras declined to address specifics on Arrieta's value, they made it clear during an interview Monday that their main historical comparison for Arrieta is Verlander, who signed a seven-year, $180 million contract extension with the Detroit Tigers in the spring of 2013.
After Verlander won the Cy Young Award and American League MVP in 2011, their ERA rose from 2.40 to 2.64 to 3.46 and their WHIP increased from 0.92 to 1.06 to 1.31. Arrieta's ERA, WHIP and other peripherals have similarly risen over the past three seasons.
One thing the two pitchers had in common, Boras said, was an extensive postseason workload. Verlander logged almost 50 playoff and World Series innings from 2011-12, while Arrieta threw more than 40 postseason innings during the 2015-16 seasons.
"When you have two years of postseason performances, what happens the third year?'' Boras said. "You're going to have a period where there's a lull in performance because of what happened the two prior years. It's the championship season hangover. It has nothing to do with the pitcher.''
One of the main selling points in Boras' Arrieta binder is career workload. Arrieta has pitched 1,161 regular-season innings in the majors. When Zack Greinke agreed to a $206 million deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks in December 2015, they had almost 2,100 innings on their résumé.
"When you're going out to buy the Ferrari, why buy one with 2,000 miles on it rather than one with two or three seasons' less stress on it?" Boras said.
The big separator in Boras' pitch to owners is Arrieta's postseason track record. Over the past three seasons, Arrieta is 5-3 with a 3.08 ERA, a 1.08 WHIP and 66 strikeouts in 52⅔ postseason innings with the Cubs.
"Owners are concerned about durability and performance levels and, 'What am I paying for?'" Boras said. "A No. 1 starter wins the big-boy games. You can't get a No. 1 who wins more big-boy games than Arrieta. You can't find him. He's done it."
CLEVELAND — The Indians are working on a treatment plan for All-Star reliever Andrew Miller's sore right knee.
Miller, on the disabled list for the second time this season, visited a specialist on Tuesday in New York. Manager Terry Francona said Wednesday they intend to meet with Miller, the team's medical staff and president Chris Antonetti to "map out what we want to do."
Francona anticipates the team releasing more information Thursday, when the club opens a four-game series in Minnesota.
Antonetti says that surgery is not currently an option.
HYDERABAD: A judicial inquiry into the death of a sanitary worker has been demanded by group of human rights activists who allegedly died after medical treatment was refused to them at a local hospital.
On Wednesday, at a press conference, addressed from the platform of Sindh Human Rights Defenders, the activists rejected the ongoing official inquiry as being partial to the accused.
Along with three other sanitary workers Irfan Maseeh, 30, fell while cleaning a manhole in Umerkot unconscious. The workers were pulled out by the local people and took them to the civil hospital, Umerkot, where the doctors refused to provide Maseeh lifesaving treatment as their body was covered in sludge.
In the press conference, Advocate Ali Palh, peasant's rights campaigner Punhal Sario and other rights activists told that after their recent fact finding visit to Umerkot, they are certain the assistant commissioner-led inquiry will not provide justice to Maseeh.
“The judicial inquiry should investigate why Maseeh was not given treatment at the hospital as well as why sanitary workers are forced to work without safety equipment's,” Palh demanded.
A range of measures suggested by the activists suggested, including not only employment security of the sanitary workers but also the implementation of safety rules, demanding the provincial government to act without delay to prevent the similar tragedy, for the saving of lives.

As ‘Game of Thrones' approaches its final season, it's the most recent season will be coming up for Emmy consideration. The last two seasons picked up Best Drama Series, and while Season 7 was kind of weak (I'm still not over the awful “Beyond the Wall”), it is a likely favorite to pick up the big awards again. With the show beloved among Emmy voters, two actors believe this could be their year to take home a lead Emmy award.
According to EW, Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) and Kit Harington (Jon Snow) are both submitted for the top categories this year. Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey both tried for lead in the past, but came up empty-handed. Clarke and Harington at least have the case that as the show has become smaller and as their two characters spent a large amount of time with each other, they are the nominal “leads” of the ensemble series. Also, nabbing the “lead” nomination and possible win isn't just a matter of ego. It can be beneficial for their careers and what they get paid for future work.
Personally, I think Clarke has the stronger case because their character has undergone such an amazing transformation over the course of the series. There's a clear, forceful arc where even though she's a total psychopath who doesn't flinch at burning people alive, they also navigate political power in a cunning, intriguing way. Compare that to Jon Snow, who we're told is the hero even though they make loads of bad decisions and gets bailed out by other people time after time. I've also never been that enamored of Harington's performance since I find them kind of blandly handsome but rarely charismatic.
Gold Derby reports that Lena Headey, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Peter Dinklage will go for supporting categories with Diana Rigg angling for Drama Guest Actress. Based on how Emmy voters go (voting for what was nominated in the past), I wouldn't be surprised at a ton of nominations for Game of Thrones when noms are announced on July 13th.

The ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Afghanistan died on Wednesday of wounds sustained in a bomb attack in Kandahar last month that also killed five Emirati aid workers, the UAE's ministry of presidential affairs announced.
"With great sadness and sorrow, we mourn the martyr of the nation and their duty, the righteous son Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi, who gave their pure soul for the sake of humanity," the ministry said in a statement quoted by official news agency WAM.
MADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said people write off Cristiano Ronaldo at their peril after the Portuguese forward struck twice in the 5-0 drubbing of Sevilla on Saturday as the La Liga champions and their prolific scorer roared back to life.
Ronaldo has been widely criticised in Spain for their domestic form this season and before the game with Sevilla they had only scored twice in the league, their lacklustre form mirroring Real's feeble defence of the title they won so convincingly last May.
Ronaldo was crowned world player of the year for a joint-record fifth time on Thursday and showed off their shiny Ballon d‘Or trophy on the Bernabeu pitch before kick off and when the game began they appeared to have an extra spring in their step.
They latched onto a through ball from Marco Asensio to confidently sidefoot the ball inside the near corner to score Real's second goal midway through the first half and then powered home the third from the penalty spot, their shot bouncing under Sevilla goalkeeper Sergio Rico.
“It has been a perfect week for them and I hope they continue at this pace, although I already said you have to be careful with him,” Zidane told a news conference.
Ronaldo also scored in Real's 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday to become the first player ever to score in all six Champions League group games in one season.

“I don't say that for no reason, I know them well and I see how ambitious they are every day in training, they know he's going to score. Sometimes it doesn't come off for them and no-one is happy about that, but you always have to be careful with him.”
Zidane also praised Ronaldo's overall play, as the Portuguese helped tee-up 19-year-old right back Achraf Hakimi for the fifth goal of the game before the halftime whistle.
“After watching the game we can safely say we have got them back,” added the coach after Real moved to within five points of La Liga leaders Barcelona, who visit Villarreal on Sunday.
”We're very happy with the performance as it's not easy to score five goals against Sevilla. I hope we can keep scoring, we've scored eight goals in our last two games and we have to keep going like this.
“We're growing in every sense and playing better. When you play better you create more chances, we created a lot today and scored five times, for the first time this season (in the league).”
Real left back Marcelo added: ”For me, Cristiano Ronaldo is the best player in the world. I never saw (Diego) Maradona or Pele play but I know you can't compare anyone to him.
“We're privileged to live in the same era as (Lionel) Messi and Cristiano, each own has their own story and attributes, but I prefer Cristiano.”
Later this year, Worriers will follow up their Laura Jane Grace-produced 2015 LP Imaginary Life with a new album — their first for SideOneDummy Records — and today they've shared a track from it in advance of their upcoming tour. “Future Me” is a glimmering and sentimental note-to-self in which Lauren Denitzio sings about what they regret: “When I leave, you'll never notice it/ But I relive those years like phantom limbs/ Your indecision, your lack of empathy/ I should have left, should have settled for lonely.” Listen and check out their tour dates below.

ISLAMABAD, Jan 2 (APP): Minister for Defence Production Rana Tanveer Hussain Monday said it was beyond comprehension that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan had started levelling baseless allegations against the government of rigging next general election.
Talking to a private news channel, they said Imran Khan had already suffered defeats in by-polls and local government elections and was foreseeing the same fate in 2018 general election.
The baseless charges showed their mentality of a ‘defeated person', they added.
They said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) would win the next polls with a thumping majority due to its performance and prudent policies.
Replying to a question, they said the Panama Papers case was sub judice as the prime minister had presented themselves for accountability. The government would accept the Supreme Court verdict in the case, they added.
To another query, they said the prime minister had directed the Sindh government to undertake development projects in Karachi and the federal government would provide funds for them.
Law and order situation in Karachi had improved to a great extent due to the concrete steps taken by the federal and provincial governments, they added.
islamabad - National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) will train 100,000 youth in the third phase of Prime Minister Youth Skill Development Program (PMYSDP).
Executive Director (ED) NAVTTC, Zulfiqar Ahmad Cheema said this while addressing a conference. They said that NAVTTC is committed to provide top notch quality training to Pakistani youth.
“We will bring our skill training system at par with the international standards so that our skilled youth can easily get jobs both at local and international market,” they said.
During the session, status of the ongoing training under PMYSDP Phase-III was thoroughly evaluated and further reforms were discussed to make the existing setup more transparent, effective and meaningful in the next phase.
Zulfiqar Cheema said that the final exam under Prime Minister's Youth Skill Development Program, Phase III (Batch-02) will commence from 4th July and 90 per cent of it would be based on practical exercises.
Out of three assessors, two would be industrial experts. Moreover, skill competitions would be held across the country between 15-30 July and the winners will be awarded with cash prizes and certificates.
Directors from Sindh and Baluchistan gave a detailed briefing on the progress and preparation of final examination, skill competitions and upcoming fourth phase of PMYSDP.
Zulfiqar Cheema advised the officials to work with honesty to make skill competitions more meaningful and functional. They also asked them to invite industrialists and employers so that they could witness the level of skills of the trained youth and offer them with jobs on the spot.
Representatives from the industry should also be invited during final examination, they added. “It is our top priority to provide top notch quality training at par with international standards,” they emphasized.
“The Innerbelt National Forest is the idea of Hunter Franks, a San Francisco-based artist who has been working in the Akron community since 2015. They plan to populate the freeway with potted plants, public seating, and programming meant to reconnect the two communities severed by the freeway 40 years ago. The project just received a Knight Cities Challenge grant, which is giving $15 million to projects in 26 American cities.”
Against long odds, Trump defeated Hillary decisively. Yet efforts to undermine their legitimacy continue.
Deep pro-Hillary forces are aligned against him, including Wall Street, America's intelligence establishment, and the vast majority of its deplorable media, at war with them since announcing their candidacy last year.
They won. They lost, but it's not over, not as long as interests far more powerful than sitting presidents, aspirants or successful candidates for America's highest office have final say on what they will or won't accept.
Trump won't be inaugurated until January 20. They have no public record, so it's unknown what he'll do until they begin governing.
It's why I cut them some slack compared to Hillary, their record as first lady, US senator and secretary of state revealing the extreme danger they pose.
Whether Trump turns out better or worse remains to be seen. Campaign rhetoric and policymaking usually diverge considerably.
Trump's success since announcing their presidential candidacy in mid-June 2015 is virtually unprecedented in America.
A business tycoon celebrity with no public service overcame overwhelming opposition to become America's 45th president once sworn in next month.
How they intend governing will be the measure of their legacy, but for now, efforts to undermine them remain unrelenting, almost certain to continue once in office.
Disruptive inauguration day protests are planned, aiming to rain on their parade straightaway on the most important day of their life, even with no chance of preventing their swearing in.
Jill Stein's misguided recount scam did enormous damage to Green Party credibility, accomplishing nothing but shaming herself.
Ahead of the December 19 Electoral College vote, documentary filmmaker turned coup plotter Michael Moore told GOP electors via Twitter he'd pay their fines if they defected to Hillary.
He's at it again, taking to Facebook, citing five must-do things this week to undermine Trump. “Let's get to work,” they said. “All hands on deck.” Their rant barely stopped short of urging insurrection, saying:
“1. MAKE YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN.” Contact your senators and members of congress during the holiday break while they're home. Tell them to “AGGRESSIVELY fight the Trump agenda” – even though at this point it's unknown.
“2. WRITE TO THE DNC TONIGHT.” Support Rep. Keith Ellison as new chairperson – even though he's more regressive than progressive, more neocon than liberal, a Muslim supporting endless US Middle East aggression. Apparently so does Moore given their strong support for war goddess Hillary.
“3. FORM YOUR OWN RAPID RESPONSE TEAM.” Maybe they want them armed with automatic weapons. “I will send out instructions immediately as to what we all must do,” they blustered. Are they operating from a military-style command-and-control center for political combat?
“4. MAKE PLANS NOW TO BE AT THE INAUGURATION WEEKEND PROTESTS! We need millions in the streets in DC,” they ranted. Doing what we won't know until they send instructions? Do they have stormed the White House in mind and/or the inaugural platform to prevent Trump's swearing in?
“5. YOU SHOULD RUN FOR OFFICE.” Relatively few are cut out for or are interested in becoming part of America's corrupt system.
I've stressed repeatedly. It's too debauched to fix. Voting is a waste of time. The only solution is nonviolent grassroots revolution. Nothing else can work.
Moore is no patriot. Supporting coup d'etat actions to undermine Trump shows what they really stands for.

LONDON (Reuters) - A sculptor who produced the image of Queen Elizabeth used on Britain's coins has been chosen to create a new statue of Princess Diana, the office of Princes William and Harry said on Sunday, to commemorate 20 years since their death.

Ian Rank-Broadley, whose effigy of the Queen has appeared on all UK and Commonwealth coinage since 1998, will design the statue, which now will not be unveiled until next year.
“Ian is an extremely gifted sculptor and we know that they will create a fitting and lasting tribute to our mother,” Prince William and their younger brother Harry said in a statement.
In January, the brothers commissioned a statue in honour of their mother, who died in a Paris car crash 20 years ago to be erected outside their official London home Kensington Palace.
Diana, the first wife of the heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, was killed when the limousine carrying them and their lover Dodi al-Fayed crashed in a Paris tunnel in August 1997.
William was 15 and Harry was 12 at the time.
“We have been touched by the kind words and memories so many people have shared about our mother over these past few months,” the brothers said. “It is clear the significance of their work is still felt by many in the UK and across the world, even twenty years after their death.”
It had been hoped that the statue would be unveiled before the end of the year to mark the anniversary, but Kensington Palace said that it was now envisaged that the statue would be unveiled in 2019.
The first permanent memorial to her, a 210-metre (689-foot) long fountain was unveiled in Hyde Park in 2004 after years of bureaucratic wrangling and squabbling over the design.

There have been a number of occasions during this season when Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask has left a few fans wondering, “Is they still our guy?”
I, admittedly, am one of those fans. As a die-hard Boston fan, I've watched as many Bruins games as possible this year. Whether it's Rask or fellow goalie Anton Khudobin in the net, the goaltending situation for the Bruins has felt somewhat like a roller coaster. For an outsider, this might not make much sense considering Boston is currently the third best team in the NHL at 45-17-8 with 98 points.
But if you watch the Bruins on a regular basis, then you've noticed that the biggest reason why they've been so successful this year is because of their energetic offense and their ability to score a lot of goals. It has not been because of lights-out goaltending. For instance, prior to Saturday's game against the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Bruins had allowed three or more goals in four consecutive games, and also in nine of their last 10.
On Saturday, it was a different story though. Against the No. 1 team in the Eastern Conference, the Bruins buckled down on defense to keep the Lightning in check, and Rask showed why fans should keep their faith in them by turning away 23 shots for a 3-0 win.
Heading into the Stanley Cup playoffs, which begin in less than a month, Rask is the guy that the Bruins and their fans are going to want to mind the net.
Don't Forget About the Rask Past
When a player is going through a rough stretch, it can be easy to dismiss the success they've had in the past. As a Bruins fan, I'm guilty of this, but I've forced myself to look back on everything Rask has done during their tenure with the Bruins.
During the 2009-10 season, the 22-year-old Rask surpassed Vezina Trophy winner Tim Thomas as Boston's starting goalie. They were the only goalie with a GAA of less than 2.00, as well as the only goalie with a save percentage of higher than .930. Having this success so early in their career all but confirmed that Rask was going to be the main goaltender in Boston for many years to come.
Even though Thomas returned to form and helped the Bruins win the 2011 Stanley Cup, it wasn't long before Rask reclaimed the starting spot from Thomas, and soon after led the Bruins back to the Stanley Cup Finals again in 2013. In that year's Eastern Conference Finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins — a four-game sweep — Rask faced 136 shots and only allowed two goals for a GAA of 0.50 and a save percentage of .985. One season later, Rask won the Vezina Trophy while the Bruins claimed the Presidents' Trophy.
In recent seasons, Rask has experienced a few dry spells here and there, which may have caused some fans to wonder if they have lost their “edge” (again, myself included). But he's always been more than capable of being a shutdown goalie that can lead a team deep into the playoffs. He's done it before, and they can do it again.
Prime Rask on Full Display
Watching the Bruins vanquish the Lightning on the road on Saturday was a great reminder of why this team is a contender with Rask minding the net. They made 23 saves for a 3-0 shutout to notch their 30th win of the year, increasing their record to 30-11-4, and becoming the first goaltender in Bruins history to record five 30-win seasons. That is no small accomplishment.
“Thirty wins is pretty good,” Rask said after the game. “I always try to get there, and fortunate enough to play on some good teams, and then you'll be able to get those wins.”
Fortunately for Rask, the 2017-18 Bruins are a very good team. They've proven that all year behind their young players who are hungry for a deep playoff run, and their relentless goal-scoring offense. But no competitive hockey team is complete without a confident goalie who also has the confidence of their teammates.
Rask is still that guy for the Bruins, and Saturday's game was a prime example of that.
President Donald Trump cracked a joke at their expense during a sports-related event today. At the White House Sports and Fitness Day, Trump questioned whether they had social skills, then bragged about their social media as they praised the importance of physical fitness and youth sports.
In their short speech, the president extolled the values of sports and competition, then veered slightly off topic:
Life's most valuable lessons are learned on the field competition. Young Americans will discover — that's what they do, they're learning all the time — the importance of team work, social skills. Do I have social skills? I don't know. I have social media, that's for sure. I don't know about skill but I have a lot of media.
Trump then said that young people participating in sports learned "the ability to overcome adversity" and made "lifelong friends all along the way." The president added, "The skills learned out on the track field, and the court, and the diamond, and the gridiron, and the golf course, and those tennis courts are skills that will serve young Americans for the rest of their lives."
The president's usage of social media has been a quasi-constant source of curiosity, concern, criticism, and sometimes simple incredulity. On frequent occasions, Trump has caused controversy by tweeting — and they tweets often — criticism of lawmakers, Islam, immigration, the press, and other topics. Displaying the combinational effect of disparaging remarks and their regular tweets, publications like New York Times and Forbes have even compiled lists of Trump's insulting tweets. So, he's right; they do have social media "for sure."
The president was joined by prominent athletes on the White House South Lawn, including Olympian medalist Shauna Rohbock, New York Yankees player Mariano Rivera, former NFL athlete Herschel Walker, and Olympic gold medalist Misty May-Treanor. White House adviser Ivanka Trump was also at the event.
The president also touched upon today's youth and the myriad of choices they have when it comes to entertaining themselves. Of course, this includes video gaming, addictive games on their smart phones, and more. Trump said, "You know that sports teach young people the value of patience, and perseverance, hard work, and determination. You also know these experiences can't be replicated on a cell phone or a game console; they really have to be learned and lived on the field of practice, with lots of sweat, lots of hard work, and lots of determination. And you're winners all."
In spite of their public praise for physical fitness and activity, Trump seems to stick to only one sport: golf. Even on Wednesday, Trump was seen practicing a few golf swings while children observed him.
At the White House Sports and Fitness Day, the president said, "Participating in sports builds character, forges friendships, tears down barriers, and brings people from all walks of like closer together. I've loved sports all of my life. I always loved the people of sports, but I have loved sports all of my life."
Although they did not mention which study claims this, Trump said, "Sports also helps kids stay off the street and stay out of trouble. Students who participate in sports have up to 40 percent higher test scores. That one I've never heard. That's pretty impressive."
It's unclear which study asserts that involvement in sports keeps youths from participating in risky behavior. That said, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry does report that children who take part in physical activity and fitness tend to be better at socializing, connecting with their peers, resolving issues with levelheaded fairness, and are more likely to have better self-esteem.
Given the significance of sports' impact on children's development, Trump said that they would ask the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, to develop a nationwide strategy that could boost youth sports involvement.
It's not known for sure when the program will start, but Trump seemed confident in Azar's capabilities. While turning to the secretary, the president grinned, "Can you handle it? Huh? They can handle a lot, this guy."
TOBA TEK SINGH-The Corruption Establishment (ACE) has not registered a case against a land record official, their accomplices and Kamalia Sugar Mills (KSM) management on the charge of tampering with the official record even after reports against them.
The district administration three weeks earlier wrote to the ACE director for registration of a case against a land record official, their accomplices and Kamalia Sugar Mills (KSM) management on the charge of tampering with the official record.
Deputy Commissioner Amer Ijaz Akbar said that they tampered with the state land record in favour of KSM. The DC said in their letter to ACE that Kamalia AC had reported them that state land measuring 1,201, located in Chak 55/GB Tukra and owned by the Punjab government, was sold on June 28, 1979 to Punjab Industrial Development Board (PIDB).
The AC added that at the time of computerisation of land record, land record service centre official Sheraz Gul entered the name of Kamalia Sugar Mills (KSM) by removing the name of PIDB administrator from the record. The AC also said that on Oct 21, 2015, Tehsildar had allowed correction of wrong entry in the record but ironically no record of the order of tehsildar is now available in the said office.
The AC also stated that accused Sheraz Gul altered the entry in revenue record to benefit the management of the KSM with ulterior motive and KSM management mortgaged the land with National Bank of Pakistan Kohi-i-Noor City branch and got loan of Rs2.659 billion with fraud on April 19, 2016.
On the basis of AC's report, the DC had written three weeks ago to the ACE to register a case against accused Sheraz Gul, their accomplices and the beneficiaries of altered ownership but so far the case had not been registered.
ACE Superintendent Sarfraz Warraich said that no case had so far been registered as ACE deputy director Saifullah Gill was inquiring and they called the record of the documents from the parties involved in the case.
They added that after looking into facts, a case will be registered.
The fraud case came into the notice of Punjab Board of Revenue's senior member who had ordered on Dec 1, 2016 Toba Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Ahmad Khawar Shahzad to send them a detailed report after holding inquiry into the case.
After the inquiry, ADC Ahmad Khawar Shahzad said that they had called report from in-charge of Kamalia land record office regarding change of possession of the said land. They reported that at the time of computerisation of revenue record, the accused had entered the name of KSM by removing name of administrator of PIDB.
The ADC also revealed another fact in their inquiry report that KSM management had also illegally occupied another 342 kanal 13 marla land owned by provincial government adjacent to the KSM. They said land was now being used by the KSM for dumping mud and waste water of the mills.

Accra, April 24, GNA - The Millennium Development Authority (MiDA) on Tuesday confirmed that it has been served with a writ of summons by the BXC Consortium.
BXC Consortium is one of the concessionaires that bid to manage the ECG under the Power Compact II Agreement but was disqualified and awarded to the Meralco Consortium, a company led by Manila Electricity Company from the Philippines.
A statement issued by Ms. Pamela Djamson-Tettey, the Director of Communication and Outreach at the MiDA, and copied to the Ghana News Agency, said since the issue was before the High Court, it would not comment to avoid prejudicing the ongoing court proceedings.
MiDA, therefore, assured Ghanaians that it would continue to uphold high standards of integrity and transparency throughout the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) Private Sector Participation Transaction process.
In a letter dated April 12, 2018, the Chief Executive Officer of MiDA, Martin Eson-Benjamin, explained that BXC Consortium was disqualified because the company had “one or more conflicts of interest” and, therefore, could not continue with the bidding process.
The ECG Private Sector Participation Transaction was one of the requirements under the Ghana Power Compact II signed between the governments of Ghana and the United States of America, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation.
Ghana is expected to receive about USD500 million from the American Government to improve their electricity supply and ensure efficiency in the power sector.

U of O's Intercultural Dialogue Institute holds Rumi-inspired concert in time for Valentine's Day
In a world filled with growing anxieties and racial tensions, it can be easy to conform and remain silent, something that Ottawa's Intercultural Dialogue Institute (IDI) club is working to combat.
On Sunday, Feb. 12, IDI sought to end the silence with an evening of performances that ranged from poetry recitation and speeches to singing. Much of the festivities revolved around the historical figure Rumi, who was an Islamic poet, judge, and scholar in 13th century Persia, and is a bestselling poets in the United States today.
The idea for Rumi Concert Night was originally proposed by the national IDI, and this Sunday event was the first of its kind at the U of O.
Despite a blowing snowstorm outside, the seats in Terminus were filled with over 70 people from every age and background.
Javid Moshahed, a third-year student and a coordinator within the IDI club, recited “Listen to the Reed Flute,” one of Rumi's famous poems, in perfectly fluent Persian.
When asked about the motivation for their performance, Moshahed told the Fulcrum that they thought the poem was important because of the philosophical impact that Rumi's work has on audiences.
“(Rumi) is preaching for spiritual awareness so that others should become aware of the separation (between their souls and a divine being). They give humans a superiority over other things,” they shared.
Two of the recurring themes in Rumi's work are love and dialogue, which, according to the IDI club, is one of the main reasons that they chose Rumi as their theme.
Julia Salven, a master's student and communications representative for the IDI club, explains that “Rumi is all about love, so (we thought) why not have a Rumi event close to Valentine's Day?”
Following Moshahed's opening performance, the audience heard speeches about Rumi's global influence from Angela Sumegi, an associate professor of humanities and religion at Carleton University, and Shehnaz Karim, a B.C.-based expert on Islamic studies. They were then treated to an hour of Rumi-inspired music by a live band.
Connor Avery Grant, a third-year student and the master of ceremonies for Rumi Concert Night, first joined the IDI club because of their love for diversity.
“I've noticed that there's almost a lack of appreciation for (diversity) in a lot of people. We see it everyday but we never really stop to think,” shared Grant.
Grant's thoughts were echoed by many of the performers throughout the night, who encouraged the audience to talk about and express their love, not hate.
Following the last performance, the audience broke into a unified rhythmic clap with cheers for an encore.
Due to the success of the evening, Salven hopes that the IDI club will be able to host another concert night sometime next year.
By organizing events like this, Grant says that the aim of the IDI is to help students feel safe and loved when they openly talk about their culture.
“I also hope, as with all our events, that we get a deeper appreciation of each other's values and a deeper appreciation of what makes diversity important.”
Rawalpind-Police have arrested three members of a robber's gang who were involved in burgling houses in disguise of officials of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
Police have also recovered Rs 2.2 million from the possession of the gang members which they looted from the citizens, Station House Officer (SHO) Police Station (PS) Airport Ahsan Kiyani disclosed this at a press briefing on Friday.
They said that City Police Officer (CPO) Israr Ahmed Khan Abbasi while taking notice of increasing incidents of house robberies in the city, constituted a special team under the supervision of Superintendent of Police (SP) Potohar Division Syed Ali tasking it to arrest the gang of robbers. The team after hectic efforts managed to trace the robbers who were involved in mugging houses in disguise of FIA officials and held three members of the gang.
The arrested members were identified as Dilshad Masih, Arslan Masih and Amir alias Irshad against whom cases were also registered, SHO said.
They said a gang member Hafiz Ashraf has managed to flee to Malaysia and police would write a letter to Punjab Home Department to contact the interior ministry to obtain a red warrant for the robber. They said police are also making efforts to arrest the mastermind of gang Shakeel Kiyani, who went underground.
The gang members committed house robberies within the limits of police stations Airport, Morgah, Rawat, Civil Line, Westridge, Lohibher, Sihala, Shehzad Town and Industrial Area, Ahsan Kiyani informed. Meanwhile, A clash -reportedly erupted between the two student groups at Pir Mehar Ali Shah Arid Agricultural University Rawalpindi (PMAS-AAUR), sources said on Friday.
In the clash, several students of a group sustained injuries while a group approached police for legal action against their rivals, sources added. However, the university management denied that the students fought in the premises of varsity.
According to sources, a clash took place between two student groups - one is known as Gilgit-Baltistan Student Group while other is Peace Group, at PMAS-AAUR on some issue. In result, students belonging to GB
Group sustained critical injuries and have been moved to a hospital for medical treatment, sources said.
The victim-students have lodged a complaint with Police Station (PS) Sadiqabad for legal action against the members of GB Group.
Nonetheless, police have not registered any case and probing the matter. Sources disclosed the head of Peace Group namely Shakeeb is said to be employed in a spying agency against whom the university administration has also approached their mother institution for initiating action.
SHO PS Sadiqabad Tahir Kazmi and PMAS-AAUR spokesperson were not available for their version.
The United States Secret Service is investigating a half-dozen real estate scam incidents in the Lowcountry.
"We have six known cases in the low country in the last four weeks with total losses approaching half a million dollars," Agent John Kenney said.
The scam targets emails being exchanged between closing attorneys and realtors as a real estate deal is about to close, Kenney said.
Hackers have accessed the closing attorneys' email accounts and created a spoof account which closely mirrors the attorneys' actual email addresses, they said. Investigators say the hackers then send an email with "new" or "updated" wiring instructions for the closing funds from the spoof account, which may only vary by one or two letters from the actual account.
When the attorney executes the wire transfer of funds from escrow, the money goes to the hackers, not the actual seller, Kenney said.
"We are working with victims, banks and other law enforcement partners to identify and arrest offenders," they said. "While the scheme operates in a similar manner, we do not believe that the cases are related at this time."
Kenney said there are several things those involved in real estate deals can protect themselves:
Be especially wary of new or updated wiring instructions.
Read email addresses letter for letter and confirm by phone with known business associates.
Confirm all details, including banking information, by phone prior to authorizing the wire.
Do not be rushed or hurried. Do not attempt execution of wires just prior to close of business.
Have all escrow account insurance policies up to date.
If you've fallen victim to such a scam, Kenney says you should contact your local law enforcement and your bank.

President Donald J. Trump last week promised Americans “a giant, beautiful, massive — the biggest ever in our country — tax cut.” As delicious as that sounds, Trump's tax overhaul may be tastiest for what it makes tiny, appealing, and compact: the 1040 tax return.
If Washington Republicans manage not to botch tax reform — as they wrecked Obamacare repeal — simplification should be among the new system's most attractive elements, along with its consolidation of seven tax rates to three: 12, 25, and 35 percent. Letting Americans keep more of their money should energize an economy finally awakening from the slumber of the Bush-Obama years.
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) proposes a simple postcard for filing typical tax returns. Rather than the current 1040 forms 79 lines, Ryan's postcard contains 14. With nearly every deduction, and exemption discarded — beside the home-mortgage and charitable write-offs — there simply would be fewer lines to fill.
This should cheer Americans who struggle to machete their way through today's tax system. The IRS's Amazon jungle is impenetrable, menacing, and plagued by pitfalls at every turn. Last month in North Dakota, Trump called America's tax structure “outdated, complex, and extremely burdensome.” They further lamented the “billions of hours wasted on paperwork and on compliance.” They added: “Our tax code is a giant self-inflicted economic wound.”
According to the IRS's latest estimates, “The average burden for taxpayers filing Form 1040 is about 15 hours and $280.” Meanwhile, “business taxpayers are expected to have an average burden of about 22 hours and $430.” All told, taxpayers spend some 6 billion hours and $195 billion on tax preparation annually. This entire enterprise is governed by the 10,928 page U.S. tax code, whose prose is as dense as tropical hardwood.
Trump's answer to this mess:
“Under our plan,” they said, “95 percent of Americans will be able to file their tax returns on a single page without having to keep receipts, fill out schedules, or track endless paperwork.”
Trump's much-welcome simplification initiative faces two immediate speed bumps:
Congressional Republicans from high-tax, left-wing states such as California and New York are squirming to keep the state-and-local-tax deduction. Dumping that loophole, however, will make Sacramento's and Albany's high-tax ways sting. And that would encourage such taxpayers to demand lower taxes from their governors, state lawmakers, mayors, and city councils.
This would be good.
“The best estimate is that roughly 95 percent of tax filers would simply choose the standard deduction rather than itemize,” predicts Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs with FreedomWorks. They note that the standard deduction would increase nearly twofold under Trump's plan. “When you begin looking at some of the deductions that Congress could do away with, like the state-and-local-tax deduction, you're also looking at ending what is essentially an incentive for states to increase their tax burdens. Really, that deduction is little more than a subsidy for high-tax states like California, Illinois, and New York. It's time Congress did away with it.”
Even more worrisome than the wagons encircling this exemption, Capitol Hill Republicans reportedly are warming to a fourth tax bracket for the highest-income earners.
This would be bad.
Washington Republicans have an infuriating habit of defeating Democrats at the polls and then impersonating them once in office. A fourth bracket, to ensnare the wealthy, smacks of far-left class warfare. Republicans should leave the rich-bashing to Bernie Sanders, Vermont's socialist U.S. senator.
Republicans should know — and loudly exclaim — that the top 1 percent of filers made 20.6 percent of all adjusted gross income and paid 39.5 percent of all income-tax revenue in 2014, the latest Tax Foundation data confirm. The top 10 percent earned 47.2 percent of total AGI and generated 71 percent of federal income taxes.
Democrats whine that the wealthy will enjoy the lion's share of Trump's tax cuts. This is logical: The wealthy pay the lion's share of taxes.
Democrats whine that the wealthy will enjoy the lion's share of Trump's tax cuts. This is logical: The wealthy pay the lion's share of taxes. This is no more shocking than a company that pays most of its commissions to those who produce the most sales.
Republicans should encourage Americans to celebrate how this plan cuts their own taxes, not scorn those who will save more, because they pay more. Further, the ensuing, robust growth will lift the fortunes of all Americans — perhaps disproportionately those whose dim prospects will brighten as the economy expands.
Trump's plan simplifies the tax code, streamlines tax filing, and creates three tax rates, all lower than today's 39.6 percent top tier. Congressional Republicans should stop their needless self-sabotage, scrap this Leftist fourth rate on the rich, and speed the enactment of President Trump's giant, beautiful, massive tax cut.

Despite Chung's happiness, concerned fans are quite worried due to their fiancé's past relationship status.
32-old- year Michael is a Taiwanese doctor who works at beauty clinic Beaute J' adore which is run by actor Tammy Chen's husband Dr Hseueh Po-ren.
Michael was briefly married to flight attendantess and blogger Ivy Chao, who is well known as Ariel Lin (actor) look-alike.
Fans are worried if Lai would repeat the same thing with Chung and on of that, this will be the star's first marriage.
Gillian's fans have warned Lai on their social media posts. One of them said, "If you are not serious, do not toy with their feelings, hope both of you are happy together".
Another said, "Please treat Gill well".
According to Apple Daily, they were asked about their sudden engagement when Chung attended actor Kara Hui's birthday banquet on Thursday.
The singer answered," They have their merits. He's good to me. You could say I met the right person at the right time."
They further said, "The most touching thing is that he's willing to tolerate my bad habits," they said. "From the beginning, I showed them all the bad things. If you can accept them, accept them. And they accepted the whole lot."
Is this also a reply to fans who have been lashing out on fiancé Lai?
However, Gillian was also greeted with lots of good wishes from fans and good friends.
Cantopop twins' member and friend Charlene Choi shared a post saying, " Thousands of words deep in our hearts. #loveyouforever" and congratulating them on their engagement.
Gillian and Michael reportedly started dating last year when the 37-year-old actor had gone to Taipei and stayed for months to shoot the web drama, Tree in the river.

Mushtaq Mojaddidi - Frosty relations between Kabul and Islamabad have put a brake on Afghanistan's ambitious plans to boost fruit exports, seen as vital to providing farmers an alternative to poppy cultivation which fuels the Taliban insurgency.
Pomegranates and grapes have long been the pride of Afghan agriculture, but exports from the landlocked country have suffered due to poor air connectivity and frequent border closures by the country's regional nemesis Pakistan.
The sight of hundreds of long-haul trucks stuck along border towns became all too common in 2016, with tonnes of fruits and perishable items going to waste and forcing some farmers to return to the more lucrative cultivation of poppy.
"We invested huge sums of money on growing fresh fruits in our orchards," grape farmer Abdul Samad from Panjwai district in southern Kandahar told AFP.
"We are very frustrated that Pakistan frequently shut the border during harvest season. We have no choice but to return to poppy farming. It will fetch us a lot more money than fruits."
Pakistan sporadically shut the main border crossings as tensions flared due to firing incidents between the troops of both nations.
Pakistan announced last June it was planning more check posts and fencing along the 2,600-kilometre (1,600-mile) frontier to filter the flow of militants.
The move prompted consternation from Afghanistan which does not officially recognise the so-called Durand Line as the international border. In 2015 around 52,000 tonnes of pomegranates were exported to Pakistan, the UAE and India. Last year the exports dropped to 15,000 tonnes, a small fraction of the total production. Other fruit exports also suffered.
"We were ready and hoping to export up to 40,000 tonnes of grapes from Kandahar, but Pakistan closed the gate for 17 days (in October), not allowing our traders to export their produce," said Nasrullah Zaheer, head of the Afghan chamber of commerce in Kandahar.
'DETERMINED TO GROW POPPY'
Agriculture Minister Assadullah Zamir accused Pakistan of using border security as a pretext to sabotage Afghan exports and shield its own farmers from competition.
"This is not the first time that border closures have happened. We had exactly the same issue in 2015 during harvest time," they said, without stating the estimated monetary losses.
"But we are here to support our farmers and the government is willing to cover a part of alternate transportation costs such as air cargo," they added.
New Delhi recently announced it would launch an air-cargo link between Afghanistan and India that will help it bypass its border issues and open new markets for traders.
The plans, however, remain at initial stages, frustrating farmers.
For years, Afghanistan has tried to give farmers alternatives such as fruit crops and saffron to wean them away from poppy farming -- the lifeblood of the Taliban insurgency.
But those efforts are failing and opium remains an economic linchpin for many Afghans.
Farmers need not bother with exports as a sprawling network of drug smugglers picks up opium produce directly from their farms, offering lucrative prices that normally far exceed the income from traditional agriculture.
In 2016, Afghanistan saw a 10 percent jump in opium cultivation compared to the previous year because of bumper harvests, collapsing eradication efforts and declining international aid to combat drugs. "Even if the government arrests us we are determined to grow poppy," said Kandahar farmer Abdul Shukoor.
"Pakistan closes the border randomly and our government is doing nothing."
Source: Mnangagwa comes out guns blazing at Moyo – The Zimbabwe Independent October 6, 2017
EMBATTLED Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, battling for survival on politically shifting sands, has come out guns blazing in their response to Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo's video-documentary dossier presented in the politburo on July 19 accusing them of plotting to oust President Robert Mugabe to secure their ascendancy.
By Owen Gagare
In an 85-page report, delivered to Mugabe last month and exclusively obtained by the Zimbabwe Independent from the vice-president's political network, Mnangagwa made a series of allegations, claims and assertions against Moyo and their key G40 allies, including Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko and Zanu PF political commissar Saviour Kasukuwere. They claimed they are the ones plotting to remove the president, not him. They said they are resolutely loyal to Mugabe.
Mnangagwa is leading a Zanu PF faction fighting with the G40 group, coalesced around First Lady Grace Mugabe, in a protracted succession war. Mphoko, Moyo and Kasukuwere are key G40 members.
In their politburo presentation, Moyo portrayed the vice-president as a cruel, corrupt and power-hungry leader systematically trying to usurp power from Mugabe.
In response, Mnangagwa said Moyo was the plotter and a United States Central Intelligence Agency agent who has infiltrated the party to destroy it from within. They said apart from their G40 allies, Moyo was working in cahoots with US diplomats, western embassy officials and opposition leaders against Zanu PF. Mnangagwa also said Moyo was working with former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Gideon Gono, MDC-T vice-president Nelson Chamisa and Sapes Trust boss Ibbo Mandaza on their succession project. Former MDC-T leader Morgn Tsvangirai's advisor Alex Magaisa was also accused of dabbling in Mugabe's succession.
The vice-president accused Moyo of recording politburo sessions and government meetings for Western embassies. They said even the July 19 politburo meeting was recorded. “I can tell you Your Excellency, the same presentation, including audio recordings of discussions of the last politburo meeting done by Professor Moyo, were delivered to Western embassies by their right hand man Edmund Kudzayi . . .,” they say.
“On August 3 2017, the United States embassy senior management and its intelligence operatives met and discussed issues that we deliberated on here using a recording they have confirmed was made by Professor Moyo. Their decision to distribute the proceedings of the meeting confirms who their handlers are and their not-so-hidden intentions insofar as their project to destroy Zanu PF from within is concerned.”
Mnangagwa challenged Moyo “to confirm or deny” the charge.
“Your Excellency, I put it to you that even American Ambassador Harry Thomas, and their colleagues can confirm what I have just said,” writes Mnangagwa.
Asked to respond to allegations that Moyo was a CIA spy and was supplying the US embassy with information, David McGuire, embassy spokesperson, said: “In their day-to-day work, embassy staff meet and talk with individuals from across the whole of Zimbabwe's social, political and cultural spectrum to help forge and maintain the best possible bilateral ties. The United States government supports democratic processes. We do not support nor fund individuals or political parties. Zimbabwe's political discourse and decisions about its future are a matter for Zimbabweans.”
Mnangagwa said Moyo, Gono, Mandaza and Kasukuwere were running a succession project using their name to mask their plot. They said Moyo and their allies want Gono to be the next president.
“Professor Moyo has been luring Dr Gono, telling them that they will make them the country's next president and I can tell you that there was a picture which circulated in the media, where Professor Moyo was standing together with former advisor to Morgan Tsvangirai, Dr Alex Magaisa and Cde Kasukuwere at the Plot Restaurant (in Borrowdale),” Mnangagwa says.
“Dr Gono was also present, but they refused to be part of the picture crew, and this has been confirmed by Dr Alex Magaisa, as well as their female companion, who is well-known to Professor Moyo and who happened to have accompanied them for coffee at that restaurant.”
Gono, now chairperson of the Special Economic Zones Authority (Seza), laughed when asked about the alleged succession project and the Borrowdale meeting, saying: “In keeping with my upbringing, I respect all members of my party Zanu PF and I do not punch above my weight in thought, word or deed. It would be out of line and protocol if I was to shame the source of that report and my seniors by rubbishing the assertions you allege to be contained in the so-called report by the VP as I'm not aware of the alleged meeting to discuss such delicate matters.
“The authors of the report, if indeed it exists, should go back to their sources and check their facts. Their real enemies are their sources, no one else. In my job as Seza chairperson, I meet a lot of people from across the political divide. Finally, I'm on record as saying that I do not belong to any faction and that I stand by my President till death do us apart. Any talk of or around succeeding them before their time is out of bounce for me and can only be promoted by those who do not know the party constitution and what it says in respect thereof. Fortunately I'm not one of those who do not know.”
Magaisa said they have never attended a Zanu PF succession meeting.
“I went to a restaurant with two friends for breakfast. We exchanged greetings with fellow Zimbabweans who were also there and a picture was taken upon request. I saw no problem with it as I get pictures taken many times with readers of the Big Saturday Read, my law and politics blog,” they said.
“That much has been and is being made of that picture demonstrates a real serious shortcoming in the intelligence of those who are making a mountain out of a molehill.”
Mnangagwa also said Moyo's presentation at Sapes Trust on June 1, where they made suggestions Defence minister Sydney Sekeramayi was a better candidate to succeed Mugabe than Mnangagwa, pointed to “a sinister joining of minds between Moyo and Mandaza”, who has been pushing for a National Transitional Authority.
Mandaza said they would only comment after reading Mnangagwa's report.
“The idea then is to talk about succession outside the party domain and then smuggle it in as is happening now,” says Mnangagwa. “This brings us to the question, who are the real successionists in Zanu PF? The real successionist is Professor Moyo who is ably supported by Vice-President Phelekezela Mphoko and Cde Kasukuwere here.
“I ask VP Mphoko if they have ever given Their Excellency minutes of the numerous meetings they hold at Number 4 Coffee Road (Mphoko's official residence). Their aides can confirm spending loads of time waiting for these men to finish their meetings, which in most cases run into the wee hours of the night.”
Mnangagwa further claimed Moyo and Kasukuwere formed militia groups and tried to hire Jim Kunaka to attack rivals and had links with MDC-T, particularly with Chamisa. “Together they have formed an alliance with their collaborators within the MDC-T and their thrust as the progressive elements, they say they are is to remove the older generation surrounding you through means outside normal processes,” Mnangagwa says.
“Nelson Chamisa confided with one of their friends that their plan is to, among other things, cause the purge of the party's senior leadership, one by one in order to create a free pathway for them to power. In Chamisa's own words ‘we need to deal with Their Excellency in order to determine the future of Zanu PF'.”
Mnangagwa alleged Moyo and Kasukuwere have also been trying to seize control of the army.
“Their plan has revolved around systematically eliminating the war veteran element within the military establishment since they are aware of the unbreakable bond that exists between the army and Zanu PF,” they say.
“The very people who have stood with the President since the liberation war days are the ones now being accused by those who deserted of orchestrating a coup d'etat against the very person they have loyally served for over four decades.”
Mnangagwa claimed in March 2016, a G40 allay, Rodney Dangarembizi, approached Major-General Trust Mugova trying to recruit them into their fold.
“Dangarembizi, who was a previous acquaintance of Major-General Mugova, was sent specifically to dangle a carrot to them to join the gang with the promise that they would be appointed Commander Defence Forces,” the vice-president says.
They said Moyo and their associates had also tried to drive a wedge between Mugabe and army generals by peddling falsehoods of an imminent coup. “On July 5 2016, while you were out of the country, Professor Moyo concocted a story that their cousin Major Nkosana Moyo who is with the Presidential Guard informed you of a planned coup by the army and ‘install me as the country's new leader',” Mnangagwa says. “You specifically cited (Brigadier)-General (Anselem) Sanyatwe as the brains behind the alleged coup d'etat.”
The vice-president said Moyo had also assembled a team of journalists to promote their succession project. They said former Sunday Mail editor Kudzayi, whom they insisted worked on the Baba Jukwa project with Moyo, and ex-Chronicle editor Mduduzi Mathuthu produced the video-documentary presented to the politburo.
They also said Moyo was also working closely with three reporters from the NewsDay and Daily News newspapers. They claim one of the reporters was paid US$9 000 to do some G40 hatchet job.
Mnangagwa also said Moyo has never liked Mugabe and Zanu PF. They produced and quoted a series of their past articles when they were outside the party to support that.
On Kasukuwere, they also suggested they were a spy working closely with the former Charge D'Affairs at the European Union delegation in Zimbabwe, Carl Skau, now Alternate Representative of Sweden to the United Nations. Mnangagwa said although they have been accused of interfering in the work of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission, it was G40 officials, particularly Mphoko, Moyo and Kasukuwere, who were meddling in its affairs. They alleged Kasukuwere tried to bribe Goodson Nguni to drop Zimdef corruption allegations against Moyo.
“The national commissar here on January 4, 2017, invited Nguni for lunch at Paula's Restaurant at corner Samora Machel and Glenara Road,” they say. “I challenge Cde Kasukuwere to confirm that they offered Nguni US$20 000 which was dangled by one of your colleagues at the meeting including real estate in Borrowdale,” writes Mnangagwa.
The vice-presidents also said Kasukuwere has been trying to recruit expelled party members using money and stands. They said former war veterans leader Jabulani Sibanda had been ecocashed money and booked at Meikles Hotel by G40 to talks to come back to Zanu PF. Mnangagwa said Kasukuwere and Moyo had also approached the president of the Chiefs Council Fortune Charumbira to join them to fight Mnangagwa.
They also said Kasukuwere invited their allies to their Borrowdale home soon after their return from the United Nations Conference on Disaster and Risk Reduction in Mexico to tell them that Mugabe had ordered that they should “go after me.”
“(Rushinga MP Wonder) Mashange tells anyone who cares to listen that it was you Your Excellency who directed that Moyo should address the Sapes Dialogue where they discussed the succession issue, throwing Dr Sekeramayi's name,” Mnangagwa says.
The report also contains a series of further allegations against many other people.
It's the last step in the process declaring a 2.7 acre portion of land adjacent to Woodingford Lodge surplus.
A public meeting is scheduled for April 25 to consider the adoption of a bylaw to declare a portion of land located at 300 Juliana Drive in Woodstock surplus and dispose of it.
Following a bylaw staff will also release a request for proposals for a residential development on the land that hopefully will include affordable housing units.
“We want it to be developed and an affordable housing component could be part of that,” said Paul Beaton, director of human services for the county. “
The multi-unit residence could be apartment building or townhouses.
“We will wait and see what comes,” Beaton said.
Three proposals have already been submitted by builders through an expression of interest process, designed to demonstrate experience with projects of a similar scale.
Beaton said the county could provide the land or money toward development costs of a project that includes affordable housing.
“The best option, to make it viable, would be to have (a mixture) of market rents and affordable housing,” they said.
Beaton explained the need for affordable housing outweighs the pace of affordable housing currently being built in Oxford County.
Spiraling prices have been driven in part by those who work in the GTA and want to purchase a more affordable home in a better neighbourhood than they could afford in Toronto.
For Oxford County seniors on fixed incomes or young people in low paying jobs, the average rent of $900 for one-bedroom unit is often out of reach.
Waiting lists are long for affordable housing projects such as Harvey Woods
“This leads to a shortage in the housing market,” Beaton said.
The meeting takes place at 7 p.m. in council chambers at the Oxford County Administration Building.

WOLF
HARRISBURG — Funding for a long-standing state grant program for private colleges and universities would be halved if lawmakers approve Gov. Tom Wolf's proposed state budget.
The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency has provided institutional assistance grants to nearly 90 higher education institutions that do not receive direct state aid for the past four decades. These grants are based on the number of PHEAA grant recipients enrolled at an institution. The grants help colleges and universities keep education costs down and help students with tuition on a need basis.
Wolf proposes to cut the available grant money from $25.7 million to $12.8 million next year. They would require recipient institutions to provide a currently undefined matching grant for the state aid.
Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre received a $586,000 grant in the current academic year, said President Patrick F. Leahy who acknowledged the budget pressures facing the governor and lawmakers. “Reducing this by 50 percent constitutes a small portion of the university's overall budget, but, because the grants are based on the number of students we serve with financial need, we are sorry to lose any funding that helps us support those students,” they said.
Keystone College in La Plume Twp. called the proposed cut a short-sighted approach.
“At Keystone, (institutional assistance grants) are used to assist those students who face the greatest financial obstacles in funding their college education,” said Keystone spokesperson Fran Calpin. “Therefore, reducing (the grants) not only impacts private college and universities but adversely affects the educational future of thousands of students in Northeastern Pennsylvania and throughout the state.” Colleges and universities underwrite tuition for students who aren't wealthy but are academic overachievers with these grants, said Rep. Mike Peifer, R-139, Greene Twp. It's an effective way of expanding access to education at private institutions, they said.
Peifer is in line to become chairperson of PHEAA's governing board later this month. PHEAA is a legislative-run agency.
A cut in these grants would have a big economic impact on Northeast Pennsylvania because of the considerable number of private colleges and universities there, said Peifer.
The grant program recognizes the large role that private institutions play in higher education in Pennsylvania, said Don Francis, president of the Association of Independent Colleges & Universities of Pennsylvania. They enroll 42 percent of the higher education students and award 49 percent all degrees, yet draw only 11 percent of state spending on higher education.
By tying an institution's grant to the number of PHEAA grant recipients they serve, it steers state aid to low-income and moderate-income students, Francis said.
“This makes the governor's singling out the (institutional assistance grant) program as the only higher education programs for a cut most troubling,” they said.

DETROIT >> Andre Drummond had 23 points and 20 rebounds, and Blake Griffin made a key 3-pointer in the final minute to lift the Detroit Pistons to a 111-107 victory over the Miami Heat on Saturday night.
Ish Smith added 25 points for the Pistons, including a late 3-pointer of their own. Detroit has won three in a row, the last two with Griffin in the lineup after acquiring them in a trade.
Griffins 3-pointer with 44 seconds to play put the Pistons ahead 108-101, but Goran Dragic responded with a four-point play, making a 3-pointer while being fouled with 32 seconds left. Detroit ran the clock down on the next possession, and Smith sank their only 3-point attempt of the game, from the right corner with 14 seconds to play.
Dragic scored 33 points for the Heat, who have lost three in a row. Miami was without center Hassan Whiteside, who was out with an illness.

Smith, who has struggled at times while trying to replace injured point guard Reggie Jackson, went 11 of 14 from the field and finished three points shy of their career high. Their previous season high was 19 points.
Griffin had 16 points, nine rebounds and seven assists.
TIP-INS
Heat: Kelly Olynyk and Josh Richardson scored 19 points for the Heat, and James Johnson added 18.
Pistons: Langston Galloway scored 13 points, surpassing 2,000 for their career. ... Detroit was without G Luke Kennard (foot) and G Dwight Buycks (illness).
BIG NIGHT

Inside 10 games to play in this Alberta Junior Hockey League season, the South Division finds three teams battling it out for second place.
On Tuesday night before 436 fans at Pason Arena in Okotoks, two of those teams clashed as the fourth-place Canmore Eagles took on the hometown and third-place Oilers. While up Highway 22, the current second-place Calgary Canucks were hosting the Drumheller Dragons
If all this seems a little surreal it is because Canmore and the Calgary Canucks are having their best seasons in more than a decade, throwing a real monkey wrench into the plans of Okotoks and the fifth-place Camrose Kodiaks, who when not challenging for top spot against this year's runaway leaders Brooks Bandits usually find themselves battling for second among themselves.
Now let's get to Tuesday's action.
First off, neither team was going to gain even a share of second place as the Canucks (33-16-4) clawed back from a 3-0 first-period deficit to post a 5-4 overtime win over the Dragons and reach 70 points on the season.
In Okotoks, the Oilers power play was better than the Eagles this night despite a vast difference in the overall season status, and it would produce a 4-3 win for the homeside.
“I didn't think we played well enough to win, we took too many penalties,” said Andrew Milne, Eagles GM and head coach. “I don't know what has gotten into us recently. It's not that our penalty kill isn't good but we are losing too much momentum off the penalties we are taking. It is something we are going to have to address.”
Okotoks went 2-for-6 with the man advantage while Canmore was 0-for-6.
The win moves Okotoks (32-16-5) three points clear of Canmore (30-17-6). The Oilers have 69 points while the Eagles are stalled on 66 points after suffering their first regulation-time defeat in 10 games.
Canmore goals came from Logan Ferguson (27 goals for the season), Matt Forchuk (27) and Adam Tisdale (20), who became the fifth Eagle this season to reach the 20-goal mark.
Forchuk continues to lead the AJHL in scoring, now with 79 points (27 goals and 52 assists).
Ferguson holds down second place with 77 points (27 goals and 50 assists).
The third member of the line, Braden Saretsky picked up one assist and is fifth in league scoring at 63 points (28 goals and 35 assists).
Okotoks goals came from Cory Santoro (11), Jordie Lawson (10), Jordan Xavier (22) and Reece Soukoroff (4).
Okotoks outshot Canmore 39-21 with Thomas Davis in goal for the third consecutive game for the Eagles and Riley Morris in goal for the Oilers.
In the first period, the best scoring chances came from the home town as they outshot their guests 16-5.
“We didn't start the first period really well and that shocked me,” said Milne. “I thought our guys knew where this game was at in regards to the standings but for whatever reason the momentum and energy wasn't there. … It wasn't good enough.”
Santoro would score the opening goal with 34 seconds remaining in the period. Stepping over the blue line they let a knee-high, wrist shot go that beat Davis stick side. The Eagles goaltender looked like they may have not been expecting the shot.
Each team scored once in the second period.
Ferguson would tip in Travis Verveda's point shot at 3:13 to knot the game.
Okotoks would jump back in front at 4:51 when Lawson tapped in the puck from the side of the net during a 5-on-3 situation in a period Canmore was guilty of taking a number of undisciplined minors.
Forchuk would tie the game at 2-1 just 32 seconds into the third period when they collected a Brett Stewart shot off the backboards and from behind the goal line put the puck in off Morris, who had overstretched in trying to reach Stewart's shot.
Tisdale then gave the Eagles the leads at 11:33 when they wired a shot from the slot over Morris's catching glove.
The Oilers would come right back with Xavier catching Davis the same way but from further out to the right wing boards just 25 seconds later.
Soukoroff then fired a shot from the point for a second Oilers' power-play goal as it flew past a fully screened Davis and proved to the be the game winner at 15:29.
Next up, Canmore takes on Drumheller twice this coming weekend: Friday in Drumheller (7:30 p.m., Memorial Arena) and Saturday in Canmore (7 p.m., Canmore Recreation Centre).
EAGLES NEST: The contest was the first between these two divisional rivals since F Colby Livingstone was traded from the Eagles for D Travis Verveda. … Verveda would pick up an assist on Canmore's first goal giving them five goals and 13 points in 14 games while Livingstone was held pointless and only has one goal and one assist in 11 games with the Oilers. … Eagles D Brett Stewart picked up two assists and an unfortunate double minor for highsticking that the Oilers capitalized on for their first goal. … Eagle scratches on Tuesday were F Jake Ashton and D Cole Noble. … Okotoks and Canmore will meet once more this season, in each team's final game, Saturday, March 4 in Canmore.

CLEVELAND - After another excruciating loss in which the Indiana Pacers nearly came all the way back from a late double-digit deficit before succumbing to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Paul George had blunt criticism for more of their teammates.
In the Pacers' Game 1 loss to the Cavs it was C.J. Miles who George called out for missing a potential game-winning jumper, leading George to declare, "In situations like that, I got to get the last shot. I was asking for it. C.J. took it upon himself."
Following Indiana's 117-111 loss Monday to fall down 0-2 in their first round series with the Cavs, George aimed at both Lance Stephenson and Myles Turner.
Stephenson, signed to a three-year deal late in the regular season and a major reason why Indiana is in the postseason in the first place with the Pacers going 6-1 once they were added to the team, had a plus/minus of -7 in five minutes in the third quarter when Cleveland took control of the game.
"He's got to learn to control themselves and be in the moment," said George. "Lance, in our locker room, is looked upon as a leader. Their body language has to improve. Just for the team. We all know that Lance is an emotional guy. A lot of it is their heart and their competitiveness. That emotion comes out of him. He's got to channel that toward making effort plays on the court and doing whatever they need for us to succeed."
With the Pacers going small in the third quarter, Cleveland targeted Kevin Love in the post against the combustible Stephenson. Love scored time and time again, with Stephenson picking up three fouls, at one point slamming the ball to the floor in frustration following another whistle against him.
Pacers coach Nate McMillan blamed Indiana's team defense for Love going off.
"I think we put Paul on Kyrie (Irving) and Lance went to Love," McMillan said. "They do a great job of recognizing matchups and taking advantage of it. I thought that was huge. Defensively, we just didn't play that right. The reason for it was just trying to get control of Kyrie by putting bigger defender on him. We had to try to deny entry to anyone who was in the post, but we really did a bad job of allowing Love to catch it. We didn't work to deny or front that post shot."
Still, Stephenson's final line was impressive as they finished with 13 points, two rebounds, four assists and two steals in 26 minutes. They had 16 points, seven rebounds and three assists in 27 minutes in Game 1.
George also wanted to see more out of Turner, the Pacers' second-year center, who finished with six points on 3-for-10 shooting, five rebounds and three blocks in Game 2 after averaging 14.5 points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game in the regular season.
"We just need them to challenge Tristan (Thompson), keep them off the boards," George said of the 21-year-old Turner. "He needs to make themselves available down low in the post. They need to know at this point they have to take it to the next level. We'll continue to work with him. "I've been in their ear all the way up until this point, you know that next step. And growth for him. In this league you've got to find it. He's still young. He's still learning, so it's a good thing. We're going to work with him."
George led Indiana in points (32), rebounds (8) and assists (7) on Monday, bringing their series averages to 30.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 7.0 assists while shooting 48.7 percent from the field and 55.6 percent from 3.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea joined forces for their first basketball friendly in 15 years on Wednesday amid a warming of relations since the Winter Olympics in the South and easing tensions over the North's nuclear and missile programmes.

Women athletes from the traditional foes put political differences aside to form two joint North-South teams, “Peace” and “Prosperity”, in the friendly in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the packed crowd shouting and waving balloons in what turned out to be a thriller - Prosperity won 103 to 102.
Two men's teams were playing later in the day.
“I am proud that sport has stood at the forefront of opening this great path to reconciliation, peace and prosperity between North and South Korea,” North Korean Vice-Minister of Sports Won Kil U told the South Koreans on arrival on Tuesday.
The South Koreans will return on Friday after two more games on Thursday, this time with teams divided by country - but no flags being shown.
North Korean leader and basketball fan Kim Jong-un was not spotted in the crowd on Wednesday but the chairperson of the North's National Sports Guidance Committee, Choe Hwi, who also visited South Korea for the Winter Olympics, was sitting next to the South's Unification Minister, Cho Myong-gyon, clapping hands.

Kim had suggested the friendlies to South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April when the two held their first summit at the border village of Panmunjom straddling the two Koreas.
It was the fourth time the two sides, technically still at war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty, have played together, the last match taking place in 2003.
Kim has in the past invited former U.S. NBA players to Pyongyang to play with North Korean players. They also struck up a friendship with former U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman.
Rodman, a basketball Hall of Famer and five-time NBA champ, has travelled to North Korea multiple times, prompting ridicule and criticism from some U.S. politicians and activists that their visits served as fodder for North Korean propaganda.
Relations between the two Koreas have been warming since North Korea sent athletes and a high-ranking delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang in February following a year of tension and bellicose rhetoric from both sides over North Korea's weapons programmes.
Last month, Kim held a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, a meeting that would have been unthinkable just weeks earlier.
Trump said on Tuesday that talks with North Korea were “going well” as U.S. officials seek to reach an agreement with Pyongyang over a denuclearisation plan.

This will not be the two Koreas' last opportunity to play sport together. They have agreed to march together under a unified peninsula flag at the Aug. 18 Asian Games ceremony in Indonesia and field combined teams in some events.
LOS ANGELES-Emma Watson had a ‘'crisis of confidence'' when they had to sing for ‘Beauty and the Beast', but now wants to perform musicals ‘'every day''
The 27-year-old actor took on the role of Belle for the recently released live-action remake of the 1991 animated Disney classic, and has said having to sing for the role was ‘'nerve-racking'', but admits that now she's done it they want to perform in musicals ‘'every day''.
They said: ‘'I can't even tell you how nerve-racking it was,' they explained. ‘I had a real crisis of confidence.
‘'It's something I've always done and loved to do. My family know I can do it and my friends know I can do it, but I thought, is my voice holding to hold up?
‘'But I loved it. I want to do a musical every day of my life. When I hear that song Beauty and the Beast I just melt.''
And the brunette beauty admits they took on the role after feeling a ‘'connection'' to the character as they describe them as ‘'fierce and smart''.
Speaking during an appearance on ITV's ‘Lorraine' on Monday (17.04.17), Emma said: ‘'Cinderella wasn't right for me, it didn't feel right for me but when Beauty and the Beast came back around I was like ‘I will do anything!'
‘'She's so fierce and she's so smart, she's just the coolest. My five-year-old self when I put the dress on was like ‘Oh my God.'''
It's not the first time Emma has spoken about their fears over singing in the movie either, as they previously said felt a ‘'different level of vulnerability'' when they were asked to sing in the production.
They said: ‘'It was something I talked about a lot when I got cast as Hermione, that I really wanted to sing. But I had kind of put it to bed because the acting thing had gone quite well ...
‘'Singing makes you much more vulnerable than speaking. In acting, you can hide behind a character, whereas, when you start singing, it's your own voice. For me, there's definitely a different level of vulnerability.''

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A unit of China's Fosun Group and Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co are among bidders for a stake in U.S. speciality drugmaker Arbor Pharmaceuticals LLC, the companies said on Monday.
The bids come as Chinese companies face tightening scrutiny on their overseas investments. Chinese regulators are reviewing deal agreements in minute details, and have cracked down on some large domestic conglomerates, including Fosun, for their debt-fuelled acquisitions abroad.
Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd said in a stock exchange filing its Hong Kong unit submitted on July 19 a non-binding bid for a stake in Arbor, which is backed by private equity firm KKR & Co LP.
In a separate filing, Shanghai Pharma also said it had submitted a non-binding bid for a stake in Arbor on the same day.
Both companies did not disclose the quantum of stakes they had bid for nor the financial terms but said they have not entered exclusive talks with the seller.
Fosun Pharma said its Hong Kong unit will begin conducting due diligence to determine further steps.
Arbor has appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to run the sale process, which has attracted around half a dozen preliminary bids, mostly from Chinese companies and private equity firms, according to people familiar with matter. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Some of the bidders may seek to acquire control of the company, said two of the people, adding that discussions are at an early stage still.
A potential deal could value Arbor at around $3 billion, two of the people said.
Bloomberg, which first reported on the sale process, said the bidders were seeking to buy 20 percent to 30 percent of Arbor.
Arbor did not immediately respond to a Reuters query for comment. The sources could not be named as the discussions are confidential.
Atlanta-based Arbor produces mainly branded prescription drugs for the paediatric, hospital and cardiovascular markets.
New York-based KKR agreed to buy more than a quarter of shares in the company in December 2014, in a deal that valued privately held Arbor at over $1 billion, Reuters reported at the time.
Canadian Media Producers Association says the 2016-2017 fiscal year was strong for Canada overall
British Columbia, the home of blockbuster movie shoots such as “Deadpool 2” and “Star Trek Beyond,” has surpassed Ontario as Canada's top locale for film and television production for the first time.
A new report by the Canadian Media Producers Association says the 2016-2017 fiscal year was strong for Canada overall, with production volume in the country reaching an all-time high of $8.38 billion.
B.C. has always been in the top three provinces for film and TV shoots, but the report says last year its production volume hit $2.991 billion, just ahead of Ontario with $2.977 billion. Quebec, with its thriving French-language industry, placed third with $1.754 billion.
Robert Wong, vice president of Creative BC, the provincial agency that supports the artistic sector, said increased global demand for content and the recognition that B.C. is a world-class production centre are driving the growth.
They said streaming services, including Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, are the single biggest driver. Netflix's “A Series of Unfortunate Events” and “Altered Carbon,” premiering Friday, were shot in the province.
“Blockbuster movies, we do get our fair share of them in British Columbia, that's for sure, but really what we are known for is television production,” Wong said.
“The amount of television production is really where the growth is and that includes the streaming service-type productions.”
The report says the film and television industries generated 24,120 direct full-time jobs in B.C. — only 40 more than Ontario — while it created 14,540 such jobs in Quebec.
“Star Trek Beyond” alone employed more than 3,900 British Columbians and contributed $69 million to the provincial economy during 78 days of shooting, the report adds.

Film and television productions in B.C. receive a 28 per cent tax credit for labour costs. The credit was reduced five points from 33 per cent by the previous provincial Liberal government in 2016.
Wong said a stable and reliable tax policy is key to the success of the industry, but it's also coupled with an abundance of talent, crews and variety of locations in B.C.
“The one thing that you can't legislate is basically proximity to Los Angeles,” they added. “Being in the same time zone and two and a half hours away by flight does make a big difference.”
The report does sound a note of caution about the surge in demand for content and the abundance of foreign productions in Canada. Though the country has policies to support local content, capturing more than three per cent of domestic box office for Canadian films remains elusive, it says.
“With record growth across much of Canada's production sector, there is much to celebrate this year, including the creation of jobs and a significant contribution to the country's economy,” said Reynolds Mastin, president and CEO of the association in a statement.
“But, among these big numbers are some emerging trends that require attention. As our industry continues to adapt to evolving technologies and changing consumer behaviours, we must ensure that growth benefits our entire sector, including productions that showcase Canadian stories for audiences at home and around the world.”

Source: Six provinces reject Kasukuwere | The Herald April 17, 2017
Paida Chipunza Senior Reporter
Six out of 10 ruling Zanu-PF's provinces have unanimously passed a vote of no confidence in the party's national political commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere, calling for their ouster from both party and Government positions.
 They are accused of, among other things, plotting to oust President Mugabe by creating parallel structures and corruption.
Mashonaland West Province became the latest province to pass a vote of no confidence on Cde Kasukuwere yesterday, joining five other provinces; Harare, Midlands, Mashonaland Central, Masvingo and Bulawayo.
“Zanu-PF Mashonaland West provincial executive council unanimously endorses the ouster of Cde Saviour Kasukuwere from all party and Government activities,” reads a document prepared soon after the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) meeting.
According to a petition signed by 38 out of 50 PEC members after a meeting held in Chinhoyi, Cde Kasukuwere is accused of plotting to depose President Mugabe, who is the President and First Secretary of Zanu-PF, by tampering with party structures throughout the country for their personal gain.
Cde Kasukuwere who is also Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, is also accused of corruption at both party and Government levels by demanding bribes in exchange for land allocations.
They also stand accused of imposing a candidate for the National Assembly seat in Norton resulting in Zanu-PF losing the by-election to an Independent candidate.
In Mashonaland Central, the party also wants Cde Kasukuwere''s half-brother and provincial chairperson Cde Dickson Mafios kicked out.
Cde Kasukuwere is also accused of abetting former treasurer of the Women's League Sarah Mahoka and former deputy secretary Eunice Sandi Moyo to undermine the First Lady and secretary for Women Affairs, as well as destabilising the League's structures in Mashonaland West Province.
The province also alleges that Cde Kasukuwere distributed land in the province to their cronies such as Cde Mahoka, aborting prior commitments to youths programmes.
“Now, therefore, we the undersigned members of the provincial executive council willingly and voluntarily appended our signatures in support of the above mentioned ouster of Cde Saviour Kasukuwere,” reads part of the petition.
In a letter addressed to the party's national secretary for administration Cde Ignatius Chombo, the province said it was supposed to hold its Provincial Coordinating Committee soon to endorse the decision.
However, since the party had already received overwhelming support of 38 out of 50 executive committee members supporting the ouster of Cde Kasukuwere, the PCC meeting would just be an academic exercise.
The Zanu-PF Harare provincial executive council on Saturday also passed a no-confidence vote on Cde Kasukuwere and Harare provincial commissar Cde Shadreck Mashayamombe in a day of high drama that witnessed skirmishes at the ruling party's provincial headquarters.
Three people sustained head injuries and broken arms as party supporters sympathetic to Cdes Mashayamombe and, Cde George Mashavave (provincial secretary for administration) ran amok in the city.
Cde Mashavave was among the provincial leaders who called for the ouster of Cdes Kasukuwere and Mashayamombe, respectively.
Police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Paul Nyathi confirmed the skirmishes.
Our sister paper, The Sunday Mail reports that police briefly detained Cde Mashayamombe for allegedly instigating the disturbances.
On the same day, 28 Harare provincial executive members appended their signatures to a petition calling for the dismissal of Cdes Kasukuwere and Mashayamombe over a raft of allegations, including plotting to topple President Mugabe and insulting First Lady and Women's League Secretary Amai Grace Mugabe. The Zanu-PF constitution says a motion of no-confidence can be passed by a simple majority of an organ's members. The PEC has 50 members.
The Harare and Mashonaland West provinces' petition will be submitted to the Zanu-PF national leadership in keeping with the party's disciplinary code.
Announcing the no-confidence vote, provincial secretary for administration Cde Mashavave said the petition was in accordance with Article 29 (section 251) of Zanu-PF's constitution.

Even their slogan is fake, stolen from someone else - and yet people fell for it again 30 years after falling for it the first time. Cyclical bullshit of people believing in daft slogans rather than examining the facts.

Serverless applications are all the rage right now — and some companies are even leapfrogging containers to go all-in on services like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. Unsurprisingly, these services are now spawning their own startup ecosystems. IOpipe, which is coming out of beta today, is an application operations platform (with a current focus on monitoring) for AWS's Lambda service.
The Seattle-based company also today announced that it has raised a $2.5 million seed round from Madrona Venture Group, NEA and Underscore VC, all of which have plenty of experience in the infrastructure space.
IOpipe co-founders Adam Johnson (CEO) and Erica Windisch (CTO), too, are highly experienced in this space, having previously worked at companies like Docker and Midokura (Adam was the first hire at Midokura and Erica founded Docker's security team). They recently graduated from the Techstars NY program.
The idea behind IOpipe is pretty straightforward: provide developers and ops teams better insights into how their applications run on Lambda (with support for other platforms potentially coming in the future) to help them troubleshoot bugs, memory leaks and other issues. All developers have to do to enable the service, which provides them with all the usual performance metrics for their functions in a real-time dashboard, is to wrap their functions into IOpipe's code. The service also measures calls to third-party services, including all the standard AWS services like S3 or DynamoDB.
Johnson tells me that the company's customers span a wide gamut and include startups and enterprises. This is, of course, a function of Lambda's customers, too. “Every week I'm surprised about the companies I run into that are running Lambda,” Johnson said. A year ago, these users were still mostly early adopters, but since then, quite a few enterprises are starting to experiment with Lambda or even running production workloads on the platform.
The company currently has eight employees, though with this new funding round, it'll probably expand quickly. Looking ahead, the team plans to build more features on top of its current solution (which now features a plug-in architecture) to branch out from its current operations focus to better serve developers directly, too. “We spent a lot of time up until now building out the table stakes features for monitoring and making sure they are scalable and stable,” Johnson noted, adding that the service's plug-in architecture now allows the team to provide its users with more functionality.

Last weekend, I came across two exciting programmes on PTV World, one after the other. The first one was an interview with a renowned Pakistani social scientist and educator, Professor Anees Akhtar, who is a former rector of the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) and they are currently heading an institution at Lahore. The other programme was a talk on what PTV calls the ‘Classics Show', where attention was drawn to the late Swedish physician, international health specialist and statistician, Dr. Hans Rosling (1948-1917) who became famous in their later years due to their public speeches with graphics at conferences and on TV, questioning ‘truths' that were indeed far from being so. With their son Ola, they were the co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation, holding large events which can be viewed on YouTube.
If that wasn't enough, my friend and host that TV-evening was a French artist of Pakistani origin, Asad- ur-Rehman, whose intellectual and socially concerned family, had always emphasized the importance of doing good and right in this life. Asad said that Professor Anees Akhtar's way of reasoning and speaking about issues reminded them of how their father and their friends had spoken; when the adults spoke, the children and youth were quiet, trying to understand and remember their words of wisdom and common sense, indeed often based on Islamic teachings and verses.
The painter and sculptor Asad also talked about Abdul Sattar Edhi (1928-1916), the highly respected founder of Edhi Welfare Organization in 1951, with ambulances and other emergency services, indeed for women and children. Edhi's work continues all over Pakistan, with branches in other countries, too, notably USA, UK, Canada, Japan and Bangladesh, mostly made possible through voluntary work and funding through Zakat and other contributions, not the government – throughout the holy month of Ramadan and the rest of the year.
Asad stressed, partly in frustration and partly in pride, that Pakistanis and other people of the calibre mentioned often remain ‘uncrowned kings and queens', noting that Bilguis Edhi was also a key activist. Edhi received many prizes for their impressive work, but not the most prestigious Western awards such as the Noble Prize, they said.
Prizes aside, what Asad said to me as we watched the TV programmes, was that the international media often present a tilted picture of Pakistan (and other ‘far away' countries). “The media, indeed the TV stations, should not distort reality for us”, said Asad. “We have reason to be proud of so many things and many people in Pakistan”, they continued.
One of the main points that Professor Anees Akhtar made in the interview I referred to above was Islam's emphasis on peace, love, harmony, and discipline, the latter being not least important for the thinking and work of scientists. They stressed that scientists, in this case, social scientists, should base their work on the right and good values. But they also honoured the importance of their Western (American) education. After all, a social scientist is indeed a scientist, not a theological preacher, with universal values and methods. That distinction is important not only for Muslim researchers, but also for Christian researchers, members of other religions and ideologies, such as socialism, capitalism, and so on. It is important that we try to use the more neutral, analytical scientific methods when we study the past present and future; that we try to be objective is what distinguishes science from more general observations and opinions. But our values still play a part, especially when we choose problems and issues for our studies, decide on the directions and emphasis of our research, and the way we suggest solutions. Sometimes, the scientific conclusions have to draw from our studies and data we have collected, may even be contrary to what we wish was the reality.
I was glad to hear Professor Anees Akhtar draw attention to the issues I have elaborated upon here. And it is important that we all, also in the West, recognise that it is not only in Western science and thinking we can be value-based and neutral at the same time but also in other religions and ideologies. It is probably a fact that the social sciences are less developed in many Muslim countries than in the West; that also includes Pakistan. We need to give much more prominence to making use of the social sciences in analysing and understanding our societies and cultures. I am indeed glad that the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform in recent meetings with the Council of Social Sciences (COSS), and other groups, has called upon them to advise on how the social sciences can be made better use of in future planning and decision-making in Pakistan. It is about time, considering that most countries gave social sciences prominences decades ago. I also hope that the social science teaching and research at universities be upgraded so that civil servants and politicians can make better decisions, and so that teaching at secondary schools can be better.
The in-words today are ‘evidence-based' deliberations and decisions, and ‘research-based' teaching. I am not sure I would go as far as to use the term ‘evidence-based', because only some of what the social sciences find out is that certain and conclusive. But some of what we social scientists know can also be called ‘evidence' and ‘facts'. I would suggest we use words like ‘research-based' or ‘data-based' knowledge rather than ‘evidence-based'. Let also the politicians and other people be allowed to discuss what social scientists find out since only some of it can be termed ‘evidence'; little in the social sciences is cut in stone.
Dr Hans Rosling, the other prominent name I mentioned at the beginning of my article today, was the kind of social scientist who would ask questions about what data shows and what we know, or think we know. True, they were a medical doctor and statistician, but I still claim their mind was more that of a social scientist than a natural scientist. They questioned a lot of the ‘facts' that their colleagues used, especially in demography and the ‘population explosion', and as for the general knowledge, we in the West think we have about situations and developments in developing countries. They had themselves worked a lot in Africa and India and had travelled throughout South-Asia with their wife. Later, they were affiliated to the vibrant public health milieu of Johns Hopkins University in the USA.
To make the arguments more clear, I will refer to a few of Dr Rosling's points, also discussed in their book, ‘Factfulness: Ten reasons we're wrong about the world – and why things are better than you think' (published in 2018). They say that experts cannot solve the major challenges in our time, or any time for that matter if they don't base decisions on facts, knowledge, and sound understanding. “But first, we need to erase preconceived ideas and misunderstandings, and that is a difficult thing”, they said. Yes, as an educationalist, I know that well; we think about better ways of learning new things, not about un-learning what we learnt which had become wrong over time, or was wrong even when we learnt it.
Finally, let me emphasise what the great thinkers and educators, I have mentioned in this article, have taught us: we have to learn how to reason, think and analyse issues. We have to question ‘truths' and not be orthodox; we have to double-check things we think we know, and we have to think over again about issues. For example, when people say that Swedish ideas are so great, Hans Rosling used to say that values are ‘modern and international', not ‘Swedish', and they were so glad that so much of all those outdated old, Swedish things were gone. Yes, they were probably right, but not entirely. Even what the great gurus say must be questioned; we must all think for ourselves.

This deal is likely to only be available for one day, so don't delay if you want to save yourself some cash.
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas' capital city was rocked by the fourth bombing this month, which injured two people and which the police chief says was caused by a tripwire and showed “a different level of skill” than the package bombs used in the three prior attacks.
Police Chief Brian Manley also told ABC's “Good Morning America” on Monday that both men who were injured in Sunday night's explosion in the southwestern Austin neighborhood of Travis County are white, unlike the victims in the three earlier attacks, who were black or Hispanic. They said the men were riding or pushing bicycles when the explosives detonated, which differs from the first three attacks, which involved package bombs left on people's doorsteps.
Authorities on Monday were canvassing the area in search of anything suspicious, and residents were warned to remain indoors and to call 911 if they needed to leave their homes before 10 a.m. After sunrise, officers were canvasing the area for anything suspicious.
Travis County is far from the sites of the earlier bombings, which occurred over two-plus weeks in residential neighborhoods east of Interstate 35, which divides the city.
At a news conference hours after Sunday's blast, which happened around 8:30 p.m., Manley repeated their public warning for people to not pick up or approach suspicious packages.
“We want to put out the message that we've been putting out and that is, not only do not touch any packages or anything that looks like a package, do not even go near it at this time,” Manley said. Because “we have not had an opportunity to look at this blast site to really determine what has happened.”
Manley also said authorities had worked to “clear” a suspicious backpack found in the area that was part of a separate report.
Police kept residential streets on lockdown, gradually expanding their barricades and closing off all roads into the neighborhood. Before daybreak Monday, Austin police pushed another alert to cellphones advising residents to continue staying indoors and to call 911 if they needed to leave their homes before 10 a.m. Austin's school district announced that buses wouldn't be going into the Travis County neighborhood because of police activity and that any “tardies or absences due to this situation will be excused.”
The two men injured on Sunday are in their 20s and are white. Police said they were hospitalized with injuries that weren't life-threatening.
The first of the four explosions to hit Austin this month was caused by a package bomb that detonated at a northeast Austin home on March 2, killing a 39-year-old man. Two more package bombs then exploded farther south on March 12, killing a 17-year-old, wounding their mother and injuring a 75-year-old woman.
Police said all three of those were likely related and involved packages that had not been mailed or delivered by private carrier but left overnight on doorsteps. Manley originally suggested they could have been hate crimes since all the victims of the first three explosions were black or Hispanic, but now says that investigators aren't ruling out any possible motive.
Manley last week urged residents receiving unexpected packages to call authorities without touching or opening them, and police responded to hundreds of calls about suspicious packages but didn't find anything dangerous. They continued to make similar please each time they spoke with reporters Sunday and Monday.
The latest explosion came hours after authorities raised the reward by $50,000 for information leading to the arrest of whoever is responsible for the first three explosions. It now totals $115,000.
Sunday also was the final day of the South By Southwest music festival, which draws hundreds of thousands to Austin every March. It is also the end of spring break for many area school districts, meaning families who were out of town in recent days are returning to a city increasingly on edge.
The explosions occurred far from the main South By Southwest activities, though a downtown concert by hip-hop band The Roots was canceled Saturday night after a bomb threat. Authorities later arrested a 26-year-old man, and the incident did not appear to be related to any previous explosions.

TEHRAN - Female sex workers and homeless drug addicts in Tehran should be "convinced" to undergo sterilisation to prevent social problems, a deputy provincial governor in the Iranian capital said on Sunday."
These women deal drugs, consume drugs and also work as sex workers," Siavash Shahrivar told the ILNA news agency. "Over 20 percent of them have AIDS and (they) spread various diseases," they said. "In addition to ... spreading depravity, they reproduce like hatching machines and as their children have no guardians, they sell them," they added.
"There is a project, a reality, an opinion, agreed on by many NGOs and the social elite, that if a woman is sick, and is also a sex worker and has no place to stay, they should be sterilised with their own approval, and not forcefully". "The sterilisation should be done through a project to convince homeless women to prevent social harm," they added.
Last week, when images of homeless men and women sleeping in open graves outside Tehran shocked Iranian society, a cartoonist said on social media that the women must be sterilised because they give birth to children with "weak genes".
The suggestion by Bozorgmehr Hosseinpour to "block the misery of poor humans who enter this world with many diseases, pain and addiction" outraged many people. Some said it reminded them of "Nazi cleansing" projects. They later apologised and said the women should be given consultation for sterilisation "with their own approval."
The controversy quickly turned into a political football with conservative media accusing Shahindokht Molaverdi, vice president for women's affairs, of advocating the sterilisation of homeless women -- which they deny. In April Molaverdi said the government "has not yet offered any specific plans for sterilisation of homeless women" and such plans should be "proposed and reviewed by the Health Ministry".
In recent years, there has been a growing crisis in Tehran where street children are born and sold by homeless or poor women living in and around the capital. Thousands of such children are put to work as beggars or street vendors.

LIEGE, Belgium - A gunman on Tuesday shot dead two female police officers with their own weapons before killing a bystander in a brazen suspected terror attack in Belgium, briefly taking a hostage at a school before being killed by police.
The carnage in the gritty eastern industrial city of Liege began around 10:30 am (0830 GMT) when the attacker armed with a knife repeatedly stabbed the two officers before using their own firearms to kill them, prosecutors said.
Federal prosecutors said they had launched a terror investigation into the incident, which comes as Belgium remains on high alert after a string of attacks including twin suicide bombings in Brussels in 2016 claimed by the Islamic State group.
"Armed with a knife, the suspect followed and attacked two police officers, and used their own firearms to kill them," prosecutor Philippe Dulieu told a news conference.
"He continued on foot, attacking a parked vehicle where they opened fire on a 22-year-old man in the passenger seat. The young man died.
"He then continued and entered the Leonie de Waha school. They took a woman working there as hostage. Police intervened, they came out firing on the police officers, wounding several before they were killed."
Eric Van Der Sypt, spokesperson for the Belgian federal prosecutor's office, told AFP there were "elements that point in the direction that this is a terrorist act", while police confirmed that both officers killed in the attack were women.
According to Belgian broadcaster RTBF, the shooter was released from prison on Monday and was only known for minor infractions with no known links to extremism.
Liege, a major city in Belgium's former industrial heartland, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011 when a former convict armed with grenades and an automatic rifle killed six people and wounded more than 120.
Prime Minister Charles Michel denounced what they called "cowardly and blind violence".
"All our support for the victims and their loved ones. We are following the situation with the security services and the crisis centre," Michel tweeted.
There was support from other European countries, with French President Emmanuel Macron condemning the incident as a "terrible attack" and expressing the "solidarity of the French people".
British Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK "stands resolute with our Belgian allies against terror".
Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon said Belgium's Federal Crisis Centre was monitoring the situation.
"Our thoughts are with the victims of this horrible act. We are in the process of establishing an overview of exactly what happened," Jambon wrote on Twitter.
A major security cordon was set up around the area, while panicked parents came to collect their children from the school complex.
The governor of Liege province said all the children and staff were safe and unhurt. "All the children are fine, those of the primary and kindergarten saw nothing, they were evacuated through the back of the school," Julie Fernandez, mother of a 7-year-old child at the school, told AFP.
"They were cared for by staff and psychologists and high school students were cared for in a nearby park," added Fernandez, who is also an MP.
Belgium has been on high alert since the smashing of a terror cell in the town of Verviers in January 2015 that was planning an attack on police.
The cell also had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris that killed 130 people.
Belgium further raised its terror alert level after the Paris attack and placed the capital Brussels on lockdown for a week.
The country was then hit by its own IS suicide attacks on Brussels airport and a metro station, which killed 32 people in March 2016.

Head coach Matt Ristow talks with their team after Tuesday's 6-2 win over Vanden. The Jaguars won their first league crown. Thomas Gase — Times-Herald
FAIRFIELD >> It was Valentine's Day on Tuesday night, but the Bethel High boys soccer team would have to wait to make any reservations with their significant other. Instead, the Jaguars had a date with their first-ever Solano County Athletic Conference championship.
With a 6-2 win at Vanden the Jaguars earned a share of the SCAC title with a 9-1 record in league play. Bethel will share the league title with American Canyon, which also went 9-1 thanks to a 8-0 victory over Fairfield on Tuesday night.
Moments after the Jaguars' win, Bethel players celebrated together near midfield and eventually doused head coach Matt Ristow with bucket of Gatorade. Ristow said the drenching didn't even feel that bad.
“It was definitely worth it,” Ristow said, grinning from ear to ear. “It wasn't even that cold. Like we like to say at Bethel, it's all good times.”
Ristow added that they were impressed with how Bethel bounced back from some very tough years recently to make the playoffs a year ago and then finally get over the hump with a SCAC title in 2017. In 2014 Bethel was just 2-5-1, while in 2013 it was 1-11-1 before improving last season with a 5-2-3 record that left them a game out of first place in the SCAC.
“It feels great winning the title, but it hasn't really sunk in yet,” Ristow said. “It will probably sink in tomorrow. Last year we were so close to winning league that this year it became somewhat of a challenge for us. The loss to American Canyon early was not easy but we had more dedication this year. We were more motivated, players weren't missing practice and that dedication put us over the edge in a very tight league this year. And hat's off to American Canyon as well for getting a share of the title.”
If Bethel (10-2-2 overall) was feeling any pressure early against Vanden, it wasn't showing it. Quicker than the amount of time it takes for a punk rock song to get to the chorus, the Jaguars found themselves up 1-0 as Juan Perez scored 40 seconds into the game on nice pass down the middle from Erick Moreno.
“Every single game when we score early it gives us motivation to score more,” Perez said. “And each time we score we always say that the score is now 0-0.”
Vanden tied the game at 1-1 when Gabriel Zepeda scored on a penalty kick from 10 yards out.

Bethel answered shortly after, however, as Moreno found Raul Ibarra on a corner kick near the net. Ibarra scored on a header and Bethel led 2-1 with 15 minutes remaining in the first half.
Only two minutes later Bethel scored again, this time on a bicycle kick from Perez.
“I had never scored on a bicycle kick before,” Perez said. “I'm glad I was able to do it finally in this game tonight.”
The lead was stretched to 4-1 when Ibarra scored again, this time from about 35 yards out on a free kick.
“I loved the communication and the chemistry we had on the field tonight,” Ibarra said. “We played amazing tonight and we did it all together as a family. It feels better to win as a family.
Bethel led 4-1 at halftime and only five minutes into the second half Bethel made the score 5-1 on an own goal by Vanden.
The Vikings scored to make it 5-2 on a penalty kick by Emry Coh, but Bethel answered soon after with a goal by Mario Ramos on a header. Moreno, who seemed to set up more people than match.com, had the assist, their third of the game.
Despite being up 6-2, Bethel didn't let up in its play until the clock ran out for Vanden.
“We knew we had to play hard until the final whistle sounded,” Moreno said. “When the final whistle went off, only then we were finally able to say we had it.”
The bench players immediately ran to join the 11 Jaguars on the field, where a dog pile soon took place near the 40-yard line. Handshakes, hugs and congratulations were offered all over the field.
“It feels amazing and it's truly a blessing,” Ibarra said. “I'm glad to be a part of this fellowship with my brothers. I'm glad we were all able to experience this amazing moment.”
Perez, who scored two goals, was also thrilled with the win.
“I'm just glad to get a banner,” the senior forward said. “Now each time I go to Bethel I can look up and see that I, along with my teammates, (did it) because it was a team thing, and were able to do something great. We wanted a banner tonight and that's what we got.”

Immigrant Services Shuswap, located at 371 Hudson St., N.E., would like to introduce some of our recent immigrants to the people of Salmon Arm in the hope that all citizens join us in extending a welcome to the new members of our community.
Our organization is a non-profit, non-governmental society with a mission to welcome, support and include all immigrants in the Shuswap. We value the diversity that immigrants bring to our community .
Please join us in welcoming Ziyba Ibragimova.
Ziyba Ibragimova is originally from Uzbekistan, Central Asia, and is now living in Salmon Arm. They grew up in a desert and is therefore very happy to live in B.C. They appreciate the beauty of nature, the clean lakes, the amount of trees and mountains. Hence, after immigrating to Canada, they became an environmentalist. They say that when we have such a beautiful country we need to take good care of it and, in addition, help out even more by taking the opportunity to recycle and buy many things second hand.
They also say it is not so fun to live in a desert, without water and without trees or mountains. The summers can be extremely hot and the winters can be extremely cold. To her, being able to go to a clean lake and swim is such a privilege.
During the last five years, they went to Okanagan College and also did a master's degree through Gonzaga University.
Besides choosing to make less waste in Canada, they are starting their own enterprise called One Small World Trainings.  They are offering workshops on cultural awareness and cultural adaptation for mainstream Canadian groups or organizations, and immigrant/refugee groups respectively.
Right now, Ibragimova is volunteering at Shuswap Immigrant Services Center and co-facilitating evening workshops for Syrian refugee women and Canadian women.

Drake University is well-known for its Painted Street, but what does it take for the people behind the scenes to pull off one of the extravagant highlights of the school?
The Student Activities Board (SAB) co-chairs for the Drake Relays are Karoline Sandusky and Meghan Mulligan. Sandusky, a junior public relations major with a Spanish minor, and Mulligan, a junior studying accounting with a marketing minor, joined SAB their first year. Sandusky was the co-chair of Blitz Day their sophomore year. Blitz Day is the annual event where the theme, band and Painted Street applications are released.
The process of picking which organization's squares will be included is not a first-come, first-served basis or a rotation system as most students may guess.
“We choose who gets a square on Painted Street based solely upon creativeness and incorporation of the 2018 Relays theme that is announced at Blitz Day,” said Sandusky. “Everyone has a fair chance of obtaining a square based on their artistic abilities.”
Last year's theme was “Like Never Before,” and designs are chosen by SAB based on the design's relation to the theme and its creativity. After the theme was announced at Blitz Day on April 11, organizations had until Monday, April 16 at 5 p.m. to create and submit their design to SAB. Their design may or may not have been picked to be included in the 54-square display.
“It's interested in a way because you watch the tradition from last year be painted over and the year end,” Sandusky said. “Then, it's painted these brand new, bright colors and Meghan and I get to see the new theme come to life as different groups interpret it.”
For small organizations, like Drake's Disability Action and Awareness Committee (DAAC), money used to obtain paint comes from the president and vice president's pockets.
“It is all a fun process, but very expensive for a small organization like us,” Nelson said.
DAAC created its first Painted Street square last year, designed by graphic design major Morgan Stuedemann, DAAC's vice president. While the University provides the cans of paint for the paint fight, organizations must buy their own cans and paint equipment for painting their squares.
“It is really awesome to create something that people see all year,” Nelson said. “I loved every freezing wet and colorful moment of it and cannot wait to do it all again.”
Anna Jensen, a junior studying news and public relations, sits on the executive board of Student Senate as vice president of student activities and is also the president of SAB. Jensen, involved in SAB since their first year at Drake, finds the process of painting over old squares more emotional, as their position of Relays co-chair as a sophomore allowed them to pick the squares previously on the street.
“We laid out the street and it's been really cool to know that I was a huge part of this year's street that everyone cherishes,” Jensen said. “It has been there for a year. It's had its time, but it'll be emotional knowing it's a new year.”

For Immediate Release
(Los Angeles, CA / Great Falls, Montana, August 14, 2017) Psychic to the Stars Rose Stuart has been having some great new business lately, thanks to their recent successes of predicting Trump's win, their prediction of Russian hacking, issues with North Korea, helping to find missing children, and more, in addition to predicting very personal, powerful things for individuals on a one on one basis. This has earned them an international reputation, with clients from all over the world calling to speak with them But as with any success – it unfortunately often comes with its share of haters – those jealous of the person at the top of their field.
It is with this understanding that Rose Stuart reports how there have been at least one or more psychics going around using Rose Stuart's name, stating they are them – when they are not. Trouble first came to Rose's attention when they decided to rent a booth at a Montana area fair, having moved back to their hometown of Great Falls, Montana. At least one regular client of Ms. Stuart allegedly reported that another psychic has been using Rose Stuart's name – reportedly telling people they were Rose Stuart, at a Montana area fair Rose had a booth at. Rose Stuart has now had other reports from clients who said they saw them at other locations, where Rose had never been.
Psychic to the Stars Rose Stuart says, “I've always been successful, because I love what I do, I love helping people, and I am good at what I do. I have a good reputation and my clients always come back to me. I'm also an ordained minister. I have very strong faith in God, and this is like my religion to me. But I'm very sad that this person or persons are going around trying to steal my name, and hurt my very good reputation.” Rose Stuart warns that in order to avoid imposters and criminals, to make sure to check for their only address and only phone number, as detailed at the bottom of this story.
Channeling the Divine
Rose states that they come from a family of intuitive workers, from both of their parents, to their grandparents and even great grandparents. They repeatedly remind clients how their readings are not from her, but messages from the divine.
They frequently offer prayers for clients, lights white candles for them, and asks that God bless them. One can not but help feel and know that Rose is very sincere with what they do and says, and takes their work very seriously. With a warm heart, a sincere spirit, and a strong voice that many swear – including this writer – channels the divine, It is evident that Rose – behind their kind eyes and warm smile, genuinely likes and cares about people.
Certainly not your average psychic, Rose Stuart proves that the field – despite having its share of persons that are dishonest – deserves a fair examination when it comes to Rose, their background, and the many testimonials of their clients from all over the world. A phone call or visit with Rose will undoubtedly prove to anyone with an open mind that here indeed is a woman with a refined, special gift that is at once both instantly recognizable, undoubtedly startling, and undeniably invaluable to anyone on this great journey we call life.

Some might say, oh, here's another Ferrari exhibition, haven't there been enough already in 2017 celebrating the company's the 70th anniversary?
Well, no, there have not.
Since mid-November and running until April 15, 2018, the Design Museum in London is hosting a spectacular Ferrari exhibit, but not one that is of the typical kind. Instead of just displaying a nice range of widely expensive and jaw-dropping Italian steeds, this museum went much more and beyond.
This is a more in-depth look into how the company fared in its early years, well documented by images and documentation, and all of it coming from private collections.
On display are such items as rare watches given out by Enzo Ferrari to their top drivers during the pre-war era under the Scuderia Ferrari banner. Present as well is Enzo's own driving license.
Divided into different sections, when you walk in you stare at a replica of the very first Ferrari ,followed by a room full of interesting documentation, such as the original drawings of the early cars and the original blueprints of the Ferrari factory.
You'll even find Enzo's Montblanc on display, remember that purple ink they were famous for using? Well, that was written with that very same fountain pen.
The next major room mostly features the design of the cars, how they are and where they were built and how the mechanical part of the cars is constructed.
Consider a recent clay model standing by a wooden buck and how the cars were built in the 1950s. There's even an alloy 250LM body hanging from the ceiling.
But again, it's the extras on display that keep drawing your attention and have you wanting to make sure you don't miss anything. When is the last time that you saw actual wind tunnel models on display, or the crankshafts from a Formula One engine, both a rough cast and a finished machined one?
Design Museum goes beneath the skin of Ferrari Enlarge Photo
Further down you will keep on finding some of the cars that created the Ferrari legend. A 166 Mille Miglia that was originally delivered to Gianni Agnelli flanked by the very first Ferrari flag that was draped outside the gate in 1948. But also a Ferrari 500 Grand Prix car, the very same car that Alberto Ascari took to victory in the 1952 British Grand Prix, which is flanked by trophy that Ascari received for that victory.
The racing car line continues with gems such as a 250GT SWB Speciale, a 250 GTO and even Schumacher's 2000-c hampionship winning Formula One car.
A line-up of helmets, all belonging to former Ferrari Formula One drivers, oozes the strong heritage of the brand.
The exhibit is popular. We suggest ordering your tickets online before you fly over. You will not be disappointed!

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Venezuelans must find a peaceful solution to the democratic crisis facing their country, Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said on Friday, a day after U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the prospect of a military uprising.
Videgaray, who said Mexico would use all available diplomatic means to address the situation in Venezuela, spoke after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland in Mexico City.
Tillerson said on Thursday that the Venezuelan military could decide to oust President Nicolas Maduro, but said they did not know whether that would happen.
Murder on Facebook
The suspect who allegedly shot and killed an elderly man in a Facebook video is still on the run.
The manhunt continues for a suspect who posted the murder of an elderly man in Cleveland, Ohio on Facebook. Steve Stephens allegedly shot and killed 74-year-old Robert Goodwin, Junior in a video they called “Easter day slaughter.” Facebook says the actual murder wasn't broadcast on its live feature but was posted afterwards in a video, before they used Facebook Live to talk about killing several people. Cleveland police are now calling for Stephens to turn themselves in to authorities. Goodwin is the only victim at this point. Their family is now mourning their loss after seeing them earlier Sunday.
Monica dolls (Yonhap)
Migrant women's group Talk To Me has launched its annual program to make and give multicultural dolls to kindergartners.Volunteers make the rag dolls, called “Monica” -- a play on the woman's name and the Korean word for “far away” -- and foreign residents visit kindergartens to share them with kids and encourage positive views of diversity.Raja cushions in the shape of elephants have been added to the program. The name means “king” in South and Southeast Asia, and the elephant design is meant to symbolize the bringing of good fortune.“Making the Monica dolls and Raja cushions is a good chance to combine a cultural experience with helping others and giving gifts to children,” Talk To Me representative Iresha Perera said. “I hope many people will join in to help children grow up without anti-multicultural prejudices.”Talk To Me runs programs to teach groups of volunteers how to make the dolls but people can also buy kits to make them at home. Details on how to do this, in Korean, are available at www.talktome.or.kr.The program continues until June.By Paul Kerry ( paulkerry@heraldcorp.com
Under growing political pressure, mixed up its public policy team Tuesday, putting a key Republican in charge of its operations in Washington D.C.: Former FCC Chairman Kevin Martin will serve as the company's new interim vice president of U.S. public policy.
Martin is taking over the top policy job from Erin Egan, who will continue to work as the company's Chief Privacy Officer. The news was first reported by Axios.
“Kevin will become interim head of US Public Policy while Erin Egan focuses on their expanded duties as Chief Privacy Officer,” a spokesperson confirmed. “For the last couple years, Erin wore both hats at the company.”
Facebook first hired Martin in 2015 as its vice president of mobile and global access policy. Martin had joined the FCC as commissioner in 2001, and became the commission's chairperson in 2005. They left that post in 2009 and subsequently consulted with a number of companies, including Facebook.
Facebook has been under increased pressure over its handling of customer data following the revelations that Trump campaign-linked Cambridge Analytica was able to obtain private data from over 50 million of the company's users. CEO Mark Zuckerberg even testified twice before Congress earlier this month.

Here comes Brexit!
Barcroft Media/Getty Images Brexit has given Americans the chance to save money while traveling, buying a house and refinancing. But it's not all good news. Brexit has punished savers, and stock prices have plunged. Bankrate has information and advice to get you through this turbulent time. Take a look at the ways the Brexit drama affects you. What is Brexit? Brexit is a shortening of "British exit," meaning the June 23, 2016, referendum in which British citizens voted to leave the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May will begin the formal Brexit process by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by the end of March. Once Article 50 has been triggered, the United Kingdom and the European Union will have two years to negotiate the split.
Brexit means mortgage rates are near all-time lows. Compare rates today.
The Vancouver-Mount Pleasant riding is currently held by the NDP's Melanie Mark.
Mark easily held the riding for the NDP when a by-election was triggered in 2016 after incumbent Jenny Kwan resigned their seat for federal politics.
In 2013: Incumbent Jenny Kwan crushed their B.C. Liberal opponent, 65 per cent to 18 per cent.
In 2009: Kwan easily defeated B.C. Liberal challenger Sherry Wiebe by over 7,500 votes, 64 per cent to 21 per cent.
History & Geography: Created in 1991 from the old Vancouver Centre riding, Vancouver-Mount Pleasant contains the Downtown Eastside, Mt. Pleasant, and Strathcona neighbourhoods. The riding has only elected NDP candidates since 1972, including former premier Mike Harcourt. Kwan was just one of two NDP MLAs to hold onto their seats in 2001. This is a safe NDP seat.
Candidates
BC Liberals- Conny Lin: A UBC addictions researcher and behavioral neuroscientist, Lin works for Fit Brains, a Vancouver tech company. Lin is an immigrant to Canada.
NDP- Melanie Mark: First elected in the 2016 byelection. Mark is the first First Nation woman elected to the B.C. Legislature. Prior to their election, Mark worked in the Office of the Representative for Children and Youth, and was a to deputy representative to Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond.
Greens- Jerry Kroll: CEO of Electra Meccanica, which is producing a one-person electric car and is supposed to hit the market early in 2018. Kroll is a marathoner, with 40 races to their name.

CLAIM
We fact-check a series of claims about gun control and gun violence in the United States.
No Rating
ORIGIN
In March 2018, two conservative activists and satirists, Austen Fletcher (also known as Fleccas) and MAGA Midge, collaborated on a viral video about gun violence in which actors appeared to respond in shock to a series of facts they were asked to read from a teleprompter.
In the video, MAGA Midge tells the actors, “We're going to have you reading from the teleprompter — these are real facts, these are all true, well-researched facts about gun control.” The video has been watched millions of times across YouTube and social media, and we received several inquiries about the accuracy of the “facts” contained in it, which include some of the most commonly used pro-gun rights talking points.
This is the first installment of our two-part examination of the 12 factual claims contained in the viral March 2018 video. You can read the second part here, and you can watch the video itself below:
﻿
According to the CDC, there were roughly 38,000 gun deaths in 2016. Two thirds of them were suicides.
Mostly True.
According to figures recorded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 37,848 deaths were attributed to the use of a firearm in 2016. Suicides made up 60.6 percent (not quite two-thirds) of those deaths, along with 14,415 homicides (38.1 percent), and 495 accidental gun-related deaths (1.3 percent).
There are over 300 million guns in the United States.
True.
No official tally of firearms in circulation at any given time is kept by any central location, but several recent estimates have ranged from 270 million to 357 million, so the video's statement seems a reasonable figure.
There are over five times more murders by knives than by rifles.
Unproven.
We have addressed this rather misleading claim in previous pages. In brief, Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics cited as the source of this statement are incomplete, and do not give a full picture of the ratio of homicides by knife to those caused by rifles (as a subcategory of firearms). However, FBI statistics show that firearms as a whole are involved in vastly more intentional killings than are knives.
The U.S. has the highest gun ownership rate in the world, but ranks 28th in gun murders.
Mixture.
The source for this claim is a 2012 ranking published by the UK newspaper the Guardian, which used data from the Small Arms Survey (a Swiss research project based at the Graduate Institute International and Development Studies in Geneva) and from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which tracks homicide rates around the world, including homicides involving firearms.
In their 2007 annual report, the SAS found there were 89 civilian-owned firearms for every 100 people in the United States. This gave the United States by far the highest prevalence of guns out of 178 countries.
Sources on all sides of the wider gun control debate in the United States have frequently cited the SAS figures, but they are now years old and may no longer offer an accurate reflection of reality. A spokesperson for the project told us SAS would be publishing updated statistics later in 2018.
In 2009, the most recent year for which an extensive international comparison is possible using the UNODC data, the United States ranked 16th out of 54 countries, with 3.3 gun-related homicides for every 100,000 people in the country.
In 2011, some 59 percent of all homicides in the United States involved firearms, meaning the U.S. ranked 19th out of 62 nations by this metric.
The Guardian‘s ranking, which was used as a source for the claim in the video, is not misrepresented, but it ranks homicide rates using data from a variety of different years, which is not an ideal metric.
Although some discrepancies in the rankings may exist, the basic point made in the video is sound; despite the prevalence of guns in the United States being the highest in the world, the rate of gun-related homicides in the United States is far from the highest in the world.
Handguns are responsible for more than 80 percent of total mass shootings.
Mostly False.
This claim is a bit of a mess and appears to be quite a way off the truth.
The source of the claim is a 2014 New York Times op-ed column which is cited under the video. Referring to the early 1990s, Lois Beckett wrote that “Handguns were used in more than 80 percent of gun murders each year …”
Note that this figure relates to all gun-related murders, not specifically mass shootings, as the video incorrectly stated. This is not a trivial distinction, considering the fact that much of the debate about gun control revolves around the role of semiautomatic rifles in mass shootings, such as the AR-15.
Beyond that, it's difficult to evaluate the accuracy of the claim made in the video, because it's so ambiguously stated. Does the 80 percent refer to the number of deaths from mass shootings, or the number of mass shooting incidents? How is a mass shooting defined for this claim? How does the claim factor in mass shootings in which the assailant used more than one type of weapon (a common occurrence)? And to what time period does the claim refer?
Because of the ambiguity of the video's claim, in order to get at least a sense of the role played by handguns in mass shootings we analyzed the incidents documented by Mother Jones in their mass shootings database for the two-year period between 10 March 2016 and 9 March 2018. We applied the FBI's definition of a “mass killing” — three or more people shot dead in public, not including the assailant — to this data. (You can find our analysis here.)
We found 18 mass shootings that met the FBI's criteria. In five cases (28 percent), the assailant used only a handgun to kill every victim. In eight cases (44 percent), the assailant did not use a handgun at all, and in five cases (28 percent) the assailant used both a handgun and other firearms (rifles and shotguns) to kill their victims. In total, a handgun was used in 10 out of 18 mass shootings. That's 56 percent, a much lower proportion than the 80 percent mentioned in the video. A firearm other than a handgun was used in 13 out of the 18 incidents (72 percent).
We also know that handguns were vastly less lethal in those mass shootings. The five incidents involving only a handgun led to 19 deaths out of 203 total mass shooting killings. The eight incidents not involving a handgun led to 97 fatalities.
In the four most lethal mass shootings since March 2016, the attacker either exclusively or predominantly used a rifle rather than a handgun. These four attacks — at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the Las Vegas massacre, the Sutherland Springs church massacre, and the Parkland school shooting — caused 150 out of the 203 deaths (74 percent) in all mass shootings in that two-year period.
This means deaths in mass shootings caused by handguns were vastly outnumbered by those caused by other types of firearm.
Between 1993 and 2003, gun ownership increased by 56 percent, while gun violence decreased by nearly half.
Mostly True.
Fletcher told us that the source of this claim was a 2015 post by the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI), which read as follows:
Adjusted for the US population, the number of guns per American increased from 0.93 per person in 1993 to 1.45 in 2013, which is a 56% increase in the number of guns per person that occurred during the same period when gun violence decreased by 49%.
Two things to note here are that Midge appears to have misspoken in the video: the period in question is 1993-2013, not 1993-2003 (although the trends are the same for both periods), and by “gun ownership” they mean the prevalence of guns (i.e., number of guns per person) rather than the rate of gun ownership (the percentage of the population that owns guns).
In any event, the figures in the AEI post were in turn taken from two sources: a 2012 study published by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service (CRS), and a 2015 Washington Post article. As we've already noted, no official count of the number of privately-owned firearms in circulation is kept in the United States, and the figures used by the CRS, the Washington Post, and the AEI are all estimates, albeit methodologically reasonable ones.
The AEI article claims “the number of privately owned firearms in [the] U.S. increased from about 185 million in 1993 to 357 million in 2013.” The figure of 185 million is not mentioned in either the CRS study or Washington Post article and appears to be an extrapolation. However, it's not an outrageous one: the CRS study posits an estimated 192 million guns were in circulation one year later, in 1994. In 1993, 185 million guns would equate to around 72 guns for every 100 people in the country (the population in July 1993 was 257.8 million).
The figure of 357 million guns in 2013 is an estimate provided by the Post, but it comes with a caveat, as the Post itself outlined: “This is just an estimate. These numbers are blind to firearms that enter and exit the country illegally, and to guns that break down, or are lost or destroyed.”
Nonetheless, those estimates would equate to 113 guns for every 100 people in the United States (the population in July 2013 was 316 million). Between 1993 and 2013, then, the increase in the prevalence of firearms (from 72 to 113 guns per 100 people) would represent a 57 percent increase, which is actually slightly larger than the increase claimed by the AEI and by Midge.
Even if we used more conservative estimates, the trend is clear: both the number and prevalence of privately-owned firearms has increased significantly in the past 20-25 years.
Finding the change in the gun homicide rate over the same 20-year period is much more straightforward. According to CDC figures, in 1993 the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 people was 7.0, but by 2013 it was 3.6. That's a 49 percent decline, as the American Enterprise Institute, and Midge, correctly state.
However, this doesn't prove a causal correlation. We can't say, based on these two trends alone, that the gun-related homicide rate decreased because of an increase in the prevalence of guns. Also, a striking contrast exists between the increasing prevalence of firearms, on the one hand, and the decreasing rate of firearm ownership on the other.
According to a survey by the polling company Gallup, the proportion of respondents saying they had a gun in their home or on their property decreased from 54 percent in 1993 to 39 percent in 2013. That's a fall of 28 percent. This downward trend in the rate of gun ownership is corroborated by data published by the University of Chicago's NORC (“non-partisan and objective research center”), which found a 21 percent drop in the percentage of households with guns between 1993 and 2012.
These contrasting figures suggest at first glance that the percentage of households with guns in them is falling, but individual gun owners are buying more guns.

Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final is a wrap, with the Golden Knights using their incredible home ice advantage to win a 6-4 thriller. Let's take a look at a few storylines for Game 2.
1. Will the Vegas Golden Knights Have a Response for Tom Wilson?
Tom Wilson has gone and done it again.
No, we're not talking about scoring from the seat of their pants, which they did indeed do (sort 0f). In the third period, Wilson laid out Jonathan Marchessault with a questionable late hit. Marchessault was sent to the locker room for concussion protocol, although they would return, while Wilson was assessed a minor penalty after an on-ice review from the officials.
Despite cries for a suspension, there will be no additional discipline from the league, but will there be a response from the Golden Knights? We certainly know Ryan Reaves is the man for the job, having recently proclaimed themselves “the toughest guy in the league” despite not having dropped the gloves since being acquired at the deadline, but is the Final really the time to be out there seeking revenge?
Emotions certainly run high, and they will be on the back of the player's minds, but going after Wilson should wait until next season.
2. Will the Refs Call a Tighter Game?
With only four penalties called in all Game 1, including the asupervisorstioned interference on Wilson, with a cross-check by David Perron called on the same play, it's safe to say the referees adopted a “let them play” stance.
While that certainly played a part in how wide open the game was played, it's probably safe to say that won't be the case in Game 2. Especially not with bad blood in the water and so much criticism for missed calls in the press. Look for more policing from the officials in Game 2 to maintain control and make sure things don't get out of hand.
3. Will Ovechkin Come to Play?
Sure, they registered an assist in Game 1, but Washington superstar Alexander Ovechkin was largely absent from the game, even in its waning moments when the Caps dominated play. If they are going to even the series in Game 2, the Capitals need their captain to step up once again and lead their team to victory.
Vegas has the advantage of home ice for one more game, which means coach Gerard Gallant can continue to put top defensive pair Brayden McNabb and Nate Schmidt on the ice whenever they spot “the Great Eight.” And while they clearly stifled Ovechkin in game one, it's typically a matter of time before one of hockey's all-time greatest scorers gets rolling. If Ovechkin is able to break loose in Game 2, it will greatly improve Washington's chances of going home tied 1-1.
4. Will the Defense Tighten Up?
Speaking of defense, after 10 goals in Game 1 (one empty-netter), we're willing to bet both teams will aim to shore things up on the defensive end. There were some lucky bounces on both ends, and Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury essentially put one in on himself, but there were times when both clubs looked somewhat rusty. Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby even admitted as much himself, citing the long layover both teams experienced before the series.
With just 48 hours between Games 1 and 2, look for less sloppy play in the second instalment in the series.
5. Who Will Step Up?
We already mentioned a possible candidate in Ovechkin, but how about either goaltender taking over? Both Fleury and Holtby are known for riding hot streaks, even in these playoffs, and either one could decide to seal things off in Game 2 after looking shaky in Game 1.
Evgeny Kuznetsov and T.J. Oshie certainly had their moments in the first game, while Vegas' top line of William Karlsson, Jonathan Marchessault, and Reilly Smith were buzzing at times. But it wasn't the stars who shone brightest, but the 4th line for the Golden Knights who had the biggest impact on the game.
So perhaps another unlikely candidate like Tomas Nosek or Reaves could emerge. How about Ryan Carpenter for Vegas? And no one on either team could use a big game more than Washington's Devante Smith-Pelly after failing to clear the zone on the winning goal.
It's always interesting to watch what heroes emerge as a series ebbs and flows, and we'll be curious who steps up come Wednesday night.
BAHAWALNAGAR-Pakistan Resolution is the symbol of stability and strength for the motherland and the day is not far off when Pakistanis will celebrate a real Independence Day with the liberation of Indian Occupied Kashmir.
This was said by Rana Saifullah, district president of newly formed Milli Muslim League (MML), while addressing a press conference here on Sunday.
They said that the MML will play its due role to eliminate the culture of loot, plunder and divide from Pakistan and will unite the entire nation on “Two Nation theory.” They claimed that cheating, plundering and lying will end in the politics of Pakistan with the entry of the MML. They reiterated the need for the nation to stand up against the Indian aggression in the Held Kashmir and on the boarders of Pakistan. They announced that the MML will take out “Stability of Pakistan” rally on August 14 to pay tribute to the martyrs of independence. They appealed all the religious and political parties to join the rally.
On 14 June 2017, reports of an active shooter at Travis Air Force Base turned out to be a false alarm, a spokesperson for the base told us.
The base, which is located in Fairfield, California, was placed on lockdown at about 3:20 P.M., after officials received a report of a shooter at the facility's shopping center. CBS13 reporter Steve Large posted video in which the “real world” lock down was announced over the loudspeakers on the base:
Loudspeaker outside Travis Air Force Base: Real World…LockDown. pic.twitter.com/WALDZNTFPs — stevelarge (@largesteven) June 14, 2017
At 5:17 P.M. local time, however, officials issued an all-clear, and no active shooter was found, according to Bobbie Textor, a base spokesperson:
Officials responded to [the security incident] and it was determined to be a false alarm. Because of reports of potential gunshots outside base exchange, the base immediately responded to it.
The incident occurred as Travis Air Force Base was in the midst of doing exercises for just such a scenario, and also on the same day as two actual mass shootings in the United States.
Earlier in the day in Alexandria, Virginia, a gunman opened fire on Republican members of congress who were practicing for a charity baseball game at a park. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) was wounded along with three others, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. Hours later, a gunman opened fire at a UPS warehouse in San Francisco. The shooter, who was wearing a UPS uniform, killed three people and wounded two before turning the gun on himself.
A third incident, which took place outside Barclays Center in New York City, stemmed from a dispute and ended with one man shot in the leg.
SP Saraki
Senate President Bukola Saraki is worried over the rising level of youth unemployment in the country. Saraki spoke on Monday in Abuja at a Public Hearing on Youth Development and Empowerment.
They expressed concern that 38.2 million youths in the labour force are either seeking employment or out of job.“It is imperative for the National Assembly, the Executive and the private sector as well as Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to focus immediate attention on youth unemployment and developmental crisis facing the country,” they said.
Iowa farmers are seeing soybean prices drop to the lowest level in a year, after China threatened a 25% tariff in response to threatened U.S. tariffs.
Purdue University Agricultural Economics Professor Wally Tyner says their research shows any tariff imposed by the Chinese would have only a minimal impact on producers in Iowa and elsewhere for at least a year.
“They buy their soybeans from us after our harvest in the fall through spring and then they buy from Brazil after the Brazil harvest in the spring until fall,” Tyner says. “So, they're going to buying Brazilian soybeans anyway between now and fall.”
The end result, they say, would be a very small impact between now into 2019 because Brazil wouldn't have time to react and increase its supplies.
Soybean prices as spiraling downward and Tyner has an explanation.
“Psychologically, markets overreact,” they say. “You've seen it over and over again, but they'll come back.”
Tyner says if the tariffs last for more than two years, producers would feel a much larger impact.

ERBIL, Iraq, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The United States has asked Iraq's Kurds to postpone a referendum on the independence of their autonomous Kurdish region, planned for Sept. 25, the Kurdish presidency said.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made the request on Thursday, during a phone call with the president of Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government, Massoud Barzani.
The U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from "more urgent priorities" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.
"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future," said the statement issued by the Kurdish presidency after Tillerson's call, giving no further details on the Kurdish leader's reaction to the U.S. request.
The United States and other Western nations are concerned that the vote could turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.

Air pollution in India is getting worst. The country could now be considered as China's rival regarding air pollution. A newly published study indicates that the level of air pollution in India will surpass those of China, making the country as the most polluted place in the world.
According to The Economic Times, the government is still denying that the air pollution in India was the primary reason for many premature deaths in the past years. India is now considered as China's rival in the highest air pollution health burdens in the world.
Beijing, on the other hand, has taken several measures to reduce its carbon emissions and to stabilize the level of dangerous air particles known as PM2.5 in the country. Air pollution in India is becoming worst yet the government has not yet taken any steps to prevent it.

The United States Health Effects Institute or HEI found out that air pollution in India caused more 4.2 million early deaths in the world in 2015. Air pollution in India and China becomes the highest cause of 2.2 million deaths.
Air pollution in India and China were responsible for almost half of the total global attributable deaths. India this year has registered an alarming increase with nearly 50 percent in premature deaths from 1990 and 2015.
Aside from the data analysis about air pollution, the new study also highlights that 92 percent of the world's population resides in the countries with unhealthy air. 1.1 million deaths were accounted due to air pollution in India.
HEI president Dan Greenbaum that India has still a long way to go because there are ministers who still believe that there is no strong connection and proof between air pollution in India and mortality despite the evidence of death in the past.
According to Thompson Reuters Foundation News, the government of China has become reluctant when it comes to drawing direct links between air pollution and mortality. India's spokesperson for environment ministry could not be reached for now, but Minister Anil Madhav Dave stated last week that there are not final data available to prove the link between air pollution in India and mortality.
BREITBART – CHARLIE SPIERING
Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein had a close relationship with President Barack Obama, visiting the White House complex on 13 occasions during the Obama presidency, according to visitor records.

Nine of their visits were with President Obama himself, including some events together with first lady Michelle Obama.
Other visits were with high-level staffers Valerie Jarrett, Michelle Obama's aide Melissa Winter, and Jeremy Weinstein, who served on the National Security Council between 2009 and 2011.
The New York Times reported that Weinstein has been accused of numerous sexual harassment incidents throughout their career as a movie producer.
Marisol Rifai - Twice a month, beautician Chnoor Khezri takes their equipment to a camp near Mosul and gives displaced Iraqi women who have lost everything a proper pampering and some fresh confidence.
In a small room inside the camp, the young Iranian Kurd takes out their brushes and scissors and puts blue wax to heat up in a pot. "It's not much but I work miracles with this," they say.
More than 3,600 women have endured freezing temperatures and the most rudimentary comfort levels in this camp's tents since they fled the fighting between Iraqi forces and the Islamic State group in Mosul.
Some of them arrived days earlier, others have been there months but nearly all had to leave almost everything behind them.
They were initially reluctant to follow a stranger in the sprawling camp and be separated from their husbands but a dozen of them eventually gave in to Khezri's efforts to bring them into their improvised beauty salon.
"I offer them a haircut, eyebrow and upper lip threading. They don't ask for anything specific really. They just want me to pamper them," said Khezri, a 31-year-old Iranian Kurd who runs a beauty parlour in Arbil, the nearby capital of Iraq's Kurdish region.
One of their "clients" that day is Mervet, a 30-year-old mother who watches attentively as Khezri's fingers knead the wax, apply it on the wincing face of another young lady and peel it off sharply.
"In Mosul, before the Islamic State, I used to work in a beauty salon. I find it moving to see this routine again," they say.
Azhar, 34, arrived to the Hasansham camp just days ago, after risking their lives to flee the IS-held west bank of Mosul, cross the Tigris River and escape through the liberated eastern side of the city.
"For weeks now people have been lacking everything and prices have gone through the roof. The only thing you can find there now is potatoes, wheat and lentils," they said.
No place for women
Recounting their experiences in Mosul put them in a state of rage but a look in the mirror put a smile back on their face. "I never thought a haircut would make me so happy," they said.
The word got out somehow and now a queue of women giggling at the thought of removing their hijab and getting a haircut has formed outside their temporary salon.
"There is no space for women in this camp. There are plenty of hair dressers for men. There are games for the children, but nothing for us," said one of them, 23-year-old mother of two Ghada.
"Our faces are burnt by the sun, we need creams, and basic hygiene kits. We don't even have bras," said Safa, another women standing next to them Khezri vindicated them: "There is no shame in wanting to recover your femininity. Especially in such rough living conditions, your well-being and your dignity are at stake."
Ghada, who settled in the displacement camp six weeks earlier, came "to have a look" at the salon but they do not dare take a seat.
"Since we got here, I've been suffering from anxiety attacks. I have nightmares. I see Daesh spies everywhere," they say, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. "I think I need to talk to someone... a psychologist," they whisper with an embarrassed grin.
Those who fled Mosul may have lived next to IS supporters or have relatives living in militant-controlled areas and often still feel the fear that pervaded their lives under the "caliphate".
As the sun sets on Hasansham, Khezri finally packs up their beauty tools after seven hours of non-stop work, exhausted but happy.
"Look at their faces, how they have transformed. They came here suspicious and all tightened up. They leave this place relaxed and proud for having made a moment for nobody else but themselves," they say.

ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (APP): The Neelum Jhelum hydroelectric project will be ready for inauguration on February 28 next year, the Prime Minister was briefed by officials on Wednesday.
Chairman Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) Lt Gen
Lieutenant General (Retd) Muzammil Hussain updated Prime Minister
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on ongoing electricity projects here at the PM
House.
The Prime Minister had tasked the newly appointed Chairman WAPDA to speed up execution of crucially significant hydro power projects, meeting the deadlines set for their completion.
The left tunnel connection of the Neelum Jhelum project was completed by October 23, 2016 while the right tunnel connection will be completed by April 30, 2017.
The project's dry test is scheduled for December 2017 while the wet test will be undertaken by February 1 next year by generating electricity and start earning revenue of US$15 million.
The second unit of Neelum Jhelum will be operational by March 15, 2018 while the 3rd and 4th unit by April 15.
The Chairman further briefed that speedy execution was underway on Kachhi Canal Project which consist of main canal and distribution system.

The Golen Gol hydro project will produce electricity three times more than the requirements of Chitral. This run of the river project is located on Golen Gol Nullah, a majority tributary of Mastuj River.
The project will have a 3.8 km long tunnel with an installed capacity of 108 MW to be completed with a cost of Rs 29.077 billion by December 2017.
Tarbela 4th Extension Project will enhance the capacity of the project from 3,478 MW to 4,888 MW and the first unit of the extension will be commissioned in December 2017. The 2nd and 3rd units will be commissioned by the mid of 2018.
BANGKOK — So much water is used for sex in Bangkok's brothels that it is contributing to the gradual sinking of Bangkok, officials have warned.
The capital's massage parlors – a thin euphemism for commercial sex venues – are illegally pumping so much groundwater for bathing and rinsing they are adding to the subsidence that causes the capital to sink a centimeter annually into the ground, a hydrologist said Wednesday.

PARIS (Reuters) - French police questioned billionaire Vincent Bollore on Tuesday over allegations their Groupe Bollore worked on the election campaigns of presidential candidates in two African countries in return for lucrative port contracts.
FILE PHOTO: Vincent Bollore, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of media group Vivendi, attends the company's shareholders meeting in Paris, France, April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo
Shares in holding company Groupe Bollore SA fell as much as 8 percent on the news of their interrogation, while shares in Vivendi, in which the company holds a 20.5 percent stake, also fell around 1 percent.
Bollore, whose sprawling logistics empire is a corporate powerhouse in former French colonies across West Africa, is suspected of corrupting foreign public officials and complicity in corruption, their lawyer said. They denied any wrongdoing by Bollore.
“He's indeed being questioned as we speak,” Olivier Baratelli said.
Groupe Bollore confirmed in a statement its African business interests were under investigation and said the probe related to the billing for work carried out in Guinea and Togo between 2009 and 2010 by its communications business Havas Worldwide.
It added it would cooperate with the investigation and denied any wrongdoing.
The questioning of Bollore is a sign French authorities are stepping up their years-long investigation, and are prepared to take on one of France's wealthiest individuals who built a reputation as a corporate raider.
Bollore has a net worth of $7.3 billion, according to Forbes.
Weekly business magazine Challenges reported two weeks ago that Bollore had been summoned by judges investigating whether Havas was involved in influencing elections in West Africa.
The probe involves two separate cases, one in Guinea and the other in Togo. The French judges are examining whether Havas supported the electoral campaigns of candidates who once in office granted port concessions to Bollore's group, the magazine said.
“The link that some are trying to make between the winning of these concessions and the communication operations has no business logic and reveals a total lack of understanding of this industrial sector,” Groupe Bollore said.
A spokesperson for the Guinea government, Damantang Albert Camara, told Reuters by telephone “the port concession obtained by Bollore in Guinea was in strict compliance with the laws in force.”
Togo Communications Minister Guy Lorenzo told Reuters by telephone that “we have no comment on the subject.”
Bollore's legal woes add another challenge to their son Yannick, who the Vivendi board anointed as chairperson after Bollore stepped down last week and who still heads Havas.
Vincent Bollore remains the owner of Groupe Bollore. A source close to Bollore said their departure as Vivendi chairperson was not related to the investigation.
A GIANT IN AFRICA
The latest twist in the investigation in Groupe Bollore's role in the election campaigns comes after British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica came under fire its role in Britain's Brexit referendum campaign and other national votes, including in East Africa.
Police have up to 48 hours to investigate Bollore, after which a judge may be asked whether there are grounds for a formal investigation to be launched - the next step towards a possible trial.
They also grilled Groupe Bollore's chief executive Gilles Alix and Jean-Philippe Dorent, head of the international division at advertising group Havas, a judicial source said.
Havas was integrated into Vivendi last year. Vivendi did not respond to calls seeking comment.
Groupe Bollore's Bollore Africa Logistics has a strong grip on port operations in West Africa, holding 16 container port concessions, as well as several rail concessions. It employs 25,000 people.
Groupe Bollore had revenues of 18.3 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in 2017 according to Thomson Reuters data.
The group has invested more than 3 billion euros in African ports over the past 10 years, it says on its website.
Lawyer Baratelli said the company's successful tender bids were lawful.
They said the group was awarded Guinea's Conakry container port concession in March 2011 after GETMA, a private logistics company set up in Guinea in 1979, which initially won the contract, failed to meet its contractual commitments.
Bollore group then won the contract as next best candidate, Baratelli said, adding French prosecutors had already dropped an investigation into how it won the tender in the summer of 2011.
“The award of these two port concessions to Bollore Group is perfectly lawful,” they said.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.—Uber suspended all of its self-driving testing Monday after what is believed to be the first fatal pedestrian crash involving the vehicles.
The testing has been going on for months in the Phoenix area, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto as automakers and technology companies compete to be the first with the technology.
Uber's testing was halted after police in a Phoenix suburb said one of its self-driving vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian overnight Sunday. The vehicle was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel when a woman walking outside of a crosswalk was hit, Tempe police Sgt. Ronald Elcock said.
The woman, whose name hasn't been released, died of their injuries at a hospital.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed condolences on their Twitter account and said the company is working with local law enforcement on the investigation.
KASUR- Police released a man who allegedly swindled British-based Pakistani “One Pound Fish” singer Shahid Nazir out of Rs4 million here the other day.
According to Shahid Nazir, Chunian Sugar Mills shareholder Sheikh Nishat swindled them out of Rs40 million. They said that they got a case registered against them with Pattoki Saddr police after one-and-half-year long struggle. Police arrested the suspect but later released them at the behest of influential persons of the area, they alleged. They demanded Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take notice of the incident and provide them justice. A police spokesperson said the suspect dodged the police at Iftar time and fled away. They said a special team has been formed for their arrest. The SHO concerned has also been put behind bars for negligence, they added.
BOY DROWNED
A 12-year-old boy of Gandhian Autar drowned while bathing their buffaloes at the bank of a canal here the other day.
According to police, the boy slipped off and fell into the canal. They could not resist the fast moving water of the canal and drowned. Their body was fished out and was handed over to the family. Police are investigating.
Are film festivals getting better?
That is, are they providing you—independent moviemakers—more of the things you want and need? I think they are. After all, it makes sense: With so much information continually on tap thanks to social media, Film Freeway reviews and magazines like this one, it's getting easier and easier for indie moviemakers to study up, and harder and harder for festivals to skate by with lackluster effort. Transparency, communication, razor-sharp efficiency, a commitment to inclusion and innovation—these factors used to be a bonus in a festival. Now they're a given. And long gone are the times when festivals just screened films and called it a day—the top fests of this era start with exhibition, of course, but from there they develop their own ecosystems. This auxiliary support—markets, forums, town halls, speed pitches, live reads, scholarships, roadshows, parties (oh the parties!)— functions essentially, as cinema's circle of life. It nurtures your next project even as your current one is consumed, getting your art and business that much closer to “sustainable.”
Compiling the list this year, we stuck to much of our tried-and-tested methodology (elements we continue to look for include press opportunities, networking occasions, industry attendance, high-quality workshops and panels, strong alumni services, etc.), but with a couple of twists. For one, we dug a little deeper into acceptance statistics this year, looking at how many programmed films came from submissions (as opposed to special invitation or other means). We found that the percentages fluctuate drastically across the board, no matter the size of a line-up, and we've looked for festivals that prioritize submissions.
Why does that matter? As Clint Bowie, director of programming for New Orleans Film Festival, puts it, “This is the area that most desperately needs increased transparency among film festivals. Filmmakers should know what kind of emphasis the festival places on discovering new voices.” NOFF has a mandate that at least 90 percent of its line-up must come from submissions—last year, it was 93 percent. “We post these percentages on our website and on printed materials, and feel that other festivals should be equally transparent.”
We also conducted an online reader survey this year to hear more about what you want in your festival experience. The lesson? That more than anything—more than free plane tickets and booze!—you want your films to forge a genuine connection with audiences who are truly engaged. Well, we can confidently say that that will happen at these festivals. (We also learned that you are overwhelmingly interested in festivals in the U.S. and Canada, which is why this year's list is just 10 percent international.)
I'll let a reader—Adam Stilwell, director of 2016 feature The Triangle—sum it all up. “Do the people running the festival give a shit about indie film?” they wrote to us. “Do they ‘get it?' Do they love it? Or are they just trying to make money off artists? Luckily, the latter [type] is becoming easier to spot as the years go on. Festivals that really care about acquiring thought-provoking films—and creating a place for filmmakers, producers, champions and fans to join forces for good—are on the rise. This is a really, really great thing for film and the future.”
We couldn't agree more. – Kelly Leow

Aspen, Colorado / April 2018 / aspenfilm.org / A, P
This year saw the 26th edition of Aspen Shortsfest, put on by premier Colorado film and film education organization Aspen Film. The festival gets a lot of submissions, but for those lucky enough to be accepted, lodging and ground transportation is covered. Winners receive cash prizes of up to $2,500, though a better prize may be the chance of an Oscar nomination—the festival is Academy-qualifying in five categories.
Austin Film Festival
Austin, Texas / October 26 – November 2, 2017 / austinfilmfestival.com / A, S, P
Austin Film Festival has a mild obsession with moviemaker mingling. With its concurrent Screenwriters Conference (billed as the largest in the world), the eight-day festival routinely hosts upwards of 200 panels with heavyweight writers and directors, who “come with the same networking intentions as the filmmakers,” assures Film Competition Director Harrison Glaser. You may well make a lifelong friend here—even if it's just your local filmmaker liaison, the personal host each film is assigned.

2016 was a landmark year for Calgary International Film Festival: It obtained Academy-qualifying status, upped its cash prize pool by 53 percent, doubled its press coverage and set new attendance records, and bestowed CAD$50,000 worth of short-film funding to its pitch contest winners. It also launched a series of events called Behind the Screen, including field trips to the Calgary Film Centre studio and other Alberta filming locations, masterclasses, panels, and demos on F/X and animal training. Can 2017 top that?

CIFF's reputation for top documentary programming means representatives from major doc distributors and funders flock to this tiny seaside town. You'll get acquainted with them via receptions, surprise “After Dark” parties (“notorious and one of a kind,” says Operations Manager Shannon Herring) and one-on-one meetings staff help to set up. We'd be remiss not to mention the industry-leading Points North Forum, which puts participants in touch with delegates like Oscar-winner Ezra Edelman (O.J.: Made in America).

Update: Broncos coach Vance Joseph said after practice that it appears Jared Crick may have been suffering from back spasms and the team is putting them through additional tests. That's good news as the injury could have been much worse. See our original post below.
Yet another Broncos defensive lineman injured.
Sixth-year defensive end Jared Crick was carted off the field after suffering an apparent leg injury during training camp practice on Monday. Denver coach Vance Joseph will update the player's status after practice.
#Broncos Crick leaving by cart. Hate to see this. Hurt leg. Grimaced in pain when tried to put weight on it @DenverChannel — Troy Renck (@TroyRenck) August 14, 2017
Crick (6-4, 285 pounds) entered the NFL as a fourth-round pick out of Nebraska with the Texans in 2012. They signed with the Broncos last offseason and has been the team's No. 2 defensive end, starting across from Derek Wolfe in the 3-4 defense.
Crick was able to walk into the locker room with the help of trainers but was clearly in a lot of pain. No indication as to why. — Ryan Koenigsberg (@RyanKoenigsberg) August 14, 2017
The team's defensive line has been hit hard by injuries. Nose tackle Kyle Peko is still recovering from a broken foot and Wolfe is trying to get healthy in time for Week 1 after spraining their ankle. Backup nose tackle Billy Winn suffered a season-ending knee injury against the Bears in preseason.
Crick recorded 53 tackles, broke up six passes and totaled three sacks in 15 starts last season. They own 199 tackles and 8.5 sacks in their career.
Dollar Falls From Near Six and Half Month Peak
The United States of America dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, on Wednesday, May 30, slumped from near its 6-1/2 month peak touched in the previous session.
The greenback dipped as the euro recovered from 10-month lows after reports that Italy's biggest party would make a renewed attempt to form a coalition government and end months of political turmoil.
The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was down nearly half a percent on Wednesday to a session low of 94.236, below Tuesday's 6-1/2-month high. The dollar remained steady against the yen JPY=.
Meanwhile, the euro EUR= rallied and Italian government bond yields IT10YT=RR IT2YT=TWEB settled below multi-year highs after Tuesday's market slide.
The single currency, which plunged to a 10-month low of $1.1510 on Tuesday, rose as much as 0.9 percent to a session high of $1.1647 EUR= on Wednesday. It remains down 4 percent this month against the dollar.
The Canadian dollar CAD= rose as much as 1.2 percent on Wednesday after the country's central bank held interest rates steady but suggested that it could raise rates soon, possibly as early as July.

When the Jalen Ramsey vs. A.J. Green, and Aqib Talib vs. Michael Crabtree in-game tussles played out, Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott thought back to advice they received decades ago, before their San Francisco 49ers faced the Dallas Cowboys.
“A buddy of mine, Dennis Thurman, who played for the Cowboys, called me up before we played them and said, ‘Do not get into a talking match with (receivers) Butch Johnson or Drew Pearson.' So I didn't. They were like, ‘Stay focused on the game,'” Lott said. “I'm sure that some coach or somebody said, ‘Don't get caught up in that' to the guys involved in things this season.
“Whatever the coaches said didn't work.”
Seem conflicts between cornerbacks and wideouts are simply unavoidable. It is a unique dynamic in NFL games week after week: On play after play, they match up 1-on-1, with plenty of grabbing and shoving and, yes, yapping mixed in. The tension escalates, especially if one is really outplaying the other.
Advertisement
“It can be like an Ali-Frazier moment,” said Lott, a cornerback and safety from 1981-94. “My rookie year, I remember having confrontations. They could be around the biggest or the littlest thing.”
Broncos cornerback Talib and Raiders receiver Crabtree served one-week suspensions after getting into a fight during a game — a reprise of their skirmish last season. Both times, Talib ripped a gold chain off Crabtree's neck. In another much-discussed episode, Jacksonville's Ramsey and Cincinnati's Green were ejected after a clash that looked straight out of a wrestling ring.
“There are a lot of passion and emotions out of those two positions. It happens a lot in training camp and things like that, same deal,” Minnesota Vikings receiver Adam Thielen said. “Even when you're going against your own teammates, it brings a lot of emotion out of you, especially when you're a competitor and you don't like to lose.”
The two episodes this season brought to mind other high-profile dustups. Josh Norman vs. Odell Beckham Jr. Or Andre Johnson vs. Cortland Finnegan.
These spats are at least in part a result of what Redskins cornerback Norman describes as a world of constant chatter, gamesmanship and one-upmanship.
“If you stop them, you come back and say something. Then they catch the ball, and they come back and say something. You play sound, fundamental defense and you get aggressive with guys. They don't like it and they push back. You push back,” Norman said. “And before you know it, there you go.”
They were a Panthers cornerback in 2015 when they engaged in a violent back-and-forth with Giants receiver Beckham.
Norman sees these CB vs. WR flare-ups through the prism of their job, which they say is made harder by the NFL's anti-defense rules and officiating.
“They don't want defenders to be successful. And (fans) don't want a guy to stop their man that they put in fantasy football. When we do, we're the ‘worst ever.' We're ‘trash.' But if we let someone catch the ball, we're ‘trash,' too. It's ridiculous,” Norman said. “We can't win as defensive backs. It's not set up for us to. But when we do win, and there is that little success that we have for ourselves, then we need to show it. Like, ‘Look! Take that!'”
Players on both sides of the ball say the physical and mental back-and-forth both contribute to bad feelings.
“There's a lot that goes out there on the field that's behind the scenes,” Raiders cornerback TJ Carrie said. “You really don't pay attention to it until there's an altercation.”
Whether it's a cornerback constantly jamming a receiver off the line, or a run-blocking wideout doing the shoving, those plays add up. That's aside from when a receiver isn't getting their catches, or even their targets. Or a DB keeps giving up gains.
It all can lead to frustration — and lashing out.
“It's been going on for centuries,” Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald said.
They know some defenders will “try to add unnecessary brutality to the game,” they said, and there's no way to avoid that.
But when it comes to trash talk, Fitzgerald said: “I'm not about that. If you call out my name, I'm not even going to acknowledge you. I just walk away.”
Certainly, these conflicts happen at other positions.
Still, as Redskins cornerback-turned-safety DeAngelo Hall noted, it's harder to notice individual matchups along the line of scrimmage.
“We are kind of out there by ourselves, so when we're talking or battling, you can really see two guys face to face — as opposed to five vs. five, having the whole O-line and whole D-line there. I don't know if there's more confrontation there than a defensive end and a left tackle, for example, but it's definitely more noticeable when receivers and DBs get to chirpin', because we're isolated,” Hall said.
“At the end of the day, it's me vs. you on that island.”
Hall, whose 43 career interceptions lead active players, remembers when they were with the Falcons and faced the division-rival Panthers and now-retired receiver Steve Smith.
“Me and Steve had to be separated a couple of times,” Hall said. “It was always almost to blows. Then, after or before the game, it was all cordial. Just that competitiveness of me and them wanting to beat each other down sparked those intense exchanges.”
As for some of their other past foes?
“Me and (Terrell Owens) didn't do a lot of talking. We just tried to rip each other's heads off. Me and Chad Johnson did a lot of talking, but it was all jokingly,” Hall said and paused, before adding with a chuckle: “And, of course, we tried to rip each other's heads off.”

Lahore
Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah on Saturday appeared before a committee, formed on the recommendation of Pir Hameeduddin Sialvi, to clarify their belief on Khatm-e-Nabuwat (the finality of Prophethood) in Lahore.
Explaining their faith, Sanaullah said Khatm-e-Nabuwwat was an obligatory part of every Muslim's faith and no one can claim to be Muslim by keeping a belief contradictory to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
The meeting was chaired by Nizamuddin Sialvi and attended by Pakistan Muslim League-N leader Zaeem Qadri and Maulana Rehmat Ali among other clerics.
Upon listening to the stance of the provincial law minister, the committee expressed satisfaction on their faith regarding Khatm-e-Nabuwwat and assured them that their statement will be conveyed to Pir Hameeduddin Sialvi, the sajjadah nasheen or descendant at Aastan-e-Alia Sial Sharif, and other members of the committee who could not attend the meeting.
Weeks of stalemate had ended after Pir Sialvi called off protest after meeting Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif in Sargodha last month. Shahbaz had reportedly agreed to form a committee to look into Pir Sialvi's demands.
Sialvi had been demanding resignations of Rana Sanaullah over their remarks on the Ahmadi community in a televised show.
Last month, they had also threatened the Punjab government to enforce the Islamic Sharia within a week or else be ready to face a province-wide protest, which they claimed would bring life to a halt. The spiritual leader had vowed to continue the movement of Khatm-e-Nabuwwat, or the finality of Prohethood (pbuh), till their last breath.
After three successive deadlines to the Punjab government to clarify its stance over Sanaullah's comments, the Astana-e-Aalia had announced in December last year that it would not support the ruling party in the upcoming general elections and its followers would resign from the government.

A barber has fiercely defended a sign of Kim Jong-un outside their hairdressing salon captioned: 'Don't have a bad hair day'.
Critics say the advert outside Jay's Male Grooming in Belfast featuring the crazed North Korean dictator is in "bad taste" - with the city's former mayor calling for it to be removed given Jong-un's "track record".
But the owner Jason Millar insists they won't be removing it as just a bit of light-hearted fun.
"People have been coming into the salon and saying how it's given them a giggle and that was the idea," their partner Orla McCormack told Belfast Live .
"The reaction has been great so Jason is going to keep it up until their next bright idea!"
Former Lord Mayor of Belfast, Jim Rodgers, disagrees however - and predicts it won't "go down very well".
(Image: Reuters)
The UUP councillor told the Belfast Telegraph : "I can understand where the owner's coming from, but with the track record of this individual I think it's most certainly in bad taste and will not go down very well in the area I grew up in."
Tensions between North Korea and the West are at an all-time high - with the communist state continuing to conduct ballistic missile tests and a war of words escalating between Jong-un and US President Donald Trump showing no signs of easing.
Mr Miller also told the Telegraph of the maniac leader's haircut: "It's not that far rmeoved from the short back and sides everyone seems to like now.
"It's all good-hearted banter and not something people should really be worried about."
Jong-un is thought unlikely to find it so funny however - as if the joke was within their borders the prankster would almost certainly face severe punishment, if not be sentenced to death.
(Image: PA)
Indeed, MirrorOnline reported back in April 2014 how a barber in London had been visited by angry North Korean embassy officials after displaying a poster mocking the dictator's haircut.
Staff at M&M Hair Academy in South Ealing, west London, put up a poster with “Bad Hair Day?” emblazoned across a picture of Kim Jong-un.
Two angry embassy officials turned up and demanded its removal.
Barber Karim Nabbach said their dad Mo told them "listen this isn't North Korea, this is England, we live in a democracy so I'm afraid you're going to have to get out of my salon".
“The men told them that they were being consulting their lawyers and left saying the words: ‘We will see'," said Mr Nabbach.
WWE News: Cody Rhodes shares anecdote to highlight Shane McMahon's dedication
Cody Rhodes talks about the time Shane McMahon opted to do all of their own moves for a game!
@desibrah by Dushyant Dubey News 14 Jun 2017, 19:37 IST
Shane McMahon is known for their dedication
What's the story?
Former WWE Superstar Cody Rhodes made an appearance on the Sam Roberts' Wrestling Podcast and shared an interesting story about Shane McMahon's dedication. During the appearance, Rhodes also spoke about several other professional wrestling topics including their experiences on the indie circuit.
In case you didn't know...
Cody Rhodes is a former WWE Superstar who worked with the company from 2006 to 2016. During their time with the WWE, Rhodes won the WWE Intercontinental Championship two times and was also a multiple-time tag team champion.
Since their departure from the WWE in 2016, the 31-year-old Rhodes has been working on the independent circuit as “The American Nightmare” Cody. They have performed for a host of independent promotions and has most notably featured on Impact Wrestling, Ring of Honor as well as New Japan Pro Wrestling.
The heart of the matter
Cody Rhodes talked to Sam Roberts about Shane McMahon and told a story about McMahon's dedication, with regards to the production of the WWE 2K video game.
According to Cody, during the production of the WWE 2K game, several independent wrestlers were hired and were instructed to learn the moves of WWE Superstars so that they could perform them in motion capture suits, in order for 2K to achieve realistic in-game animations for the moves.

The reason why independent wrestlers were hired for this task was to avoid having WWE Superstars spending too much time in the studios, which might have not even been possible in the first place due to their heavy schedules and travelling.
Rhodes revealed that the only WWE Superstar who refused to have an independent wrestler performing their moveset was Shane McMahon. As per Cody, McMahon insisted that they perform their own moves for the game and ended up donning the motion capture suit for long periods of time in order to make sure that their moves were captured perfectly.
What's next?
It has been reported that Cody Rhodes has wrapped up their commitments with Impact Wrestling. However, they are still very much involved in New Japan Pro Wrestling and Ring of Honor and has also been making appearances on the independent circuit whenever they can.
Rhodes is currently on “The Nightmare Tour”, where they have been making appearances on independent wrestling promotions all over North America.
They will be performing in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey on 17th June and in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on 18th June. Rhodes also has a 4th of July appearance with the Bar Wrestling promotion at Baldwin Park, CA.
As far as Shane McMahon is concerned, they have been taking care of their commissioner duties on SmackDown LIVE, although their on-screen appearances have been fewer in the past weeks than usual.
Author's take
Shane McMahon is certainly a perfectionist by all accounts. Not only does the man do everything they possibly can to steal the show every single time they perform as a professional wrestler, but they take the backstage aspect of being a McMahon very seriously as well.
Shane truly leads by example and their commitment and dedication to everything they make themselves a part of is certainly admirable!

National Zero Waste Council says consumers are confused about what best-before
A national study says confusing and unnecessary best-before labels are a major cause of food waste in Canada.
The National Zero Waste Council says consumers are confused about what best-before labels actually mean.
It says most dates that appear on products refer only to peak quality and have little to do with whether the food is healthy to eat.
Research has found that almost 400 kilograms of food per person are lost or wasted in Canada every year — one of the highest totals in the world.
The council says consumers are responsible for almost half that waste.

Here's what to watch as the National League Division Series get underway.
Bryce Harper vs. their timing
The slugger is back in the lineup after returning from a knee and calf injury, but in the last days of the regular season, they still seemed to be searching for their timing. They had three hits in 18 at-bats, with no extra-base hits, two walks and seven strikeouts. As the Nationals begin this series, they will continue to be something of a wild card.
The Cubs will assess Harper's swing and adjust their pitching plan as the series progresses, but for now, there does not appear to be a reason for Joe Maddon to have their staff pitch around Harper, in the way that they did early in the 2016 season. Harper will probably get some pitches to hit in this series.
Trea Turner vs. Willson Contreras
The Nationals' shortstop is one of a handful of elite base-stealers, with the speed, acumen and special competitive arrogance needed to run successfully even when opposing teams know that he's going to go. They have 46 steals in 54 attempts this year, and in their career, they have 81 steals in 97 attempts, an excellent ratio for someone so young. (It's probably not a coincidence that Washington's first base coach is Davey Lopes, who is generally viewed as the base-stealer whisperer -- someone who sees tells in what pitchers do and goads their charges into taking bases).
Turner will have to run, however, against Willson Contreras, who might have the strongest throwing arm of any catcher in baseball -- so powerful that he'll throw out runners even when working with pitchers slower in their delivery. When Arrieta worked with Miguel Montero in seven starts, opponents swiped 12 bases in 12 attempts; in 16 games with Contreras, runners tried to steal only eight times and were thrown out on three.
In a close game, Turner will look to run, to alter the game with their speed, and Contreras will be looking for the opportunity to throw. These two players have extreme confidence in their particular skills.
Jake Arrieta and Max Scherzer vs. their hamstrings
The two Cy Young Award winners have developed their excellence through a devotion to diligent physical training, and their regimens have constructed the foundations of unusual deliveries. Arrieta is 6-foot-4 and weighs something in the range of 225 pounds and throws with a crossfire motion, stepping toward the third base dugout as they drive fastballs homeward. Scherzer seems to throw as hard as they possibly can on every pitch, grunting in their effort; earlier in their baseball life, the sheer violence of their delivery scared teams away (to their regret later).
For either of these pitchers to have a breakdown in their physical machinery is a major concern, because of their respective effort levels in how they pitch. That could be why the Cubs backed up Arrieta in their rotation, and the Nationals pushed Scherzer back, with Stephen Strasburg starting Game 1. The clubs don't know if they will hold up from start to start. Given the limits of the remaining calendar, it may be that the best that teams can hope for is for Arrieta and Scherzer to give them one quality outing in each series -- and that they can get through five or six innings.
Stephen Strasburg vs. the weather
When it's hot and miserable, Strasburg's face reddens and it's as if all the moisture drains out of him. They grew up in Southern California, in a place of lower humidity, and whether it's because of this background or because of their DNA, Strasburg has long struggled to stay hydrated on bad days. The Nationals must be a little relieved, then, that the series against the Cubs is the stuff of prime time and Strasburg's start in Game 1 (and any other start in this series) will be in the evening, after the setting of the sun.
With Scherzer hurting, Strasburg becomes the most important player on the Washington roster. The Nationals must win at least one of their starts, and on paper, they seemingly have an advantage on the days when Strasburg pitches, so long as they can get through their work without having the heat-related problems that have shortened a lot of their past outings.
The Nationals vs. the onus of history
The Cubs played better down the stretch and separated themselves from the pack in the NL Central to reach the postseason in the first year after they won the World Series, and they seem to be entering this October tournament pressure-free. There is no more talk about billy goats or bearing the hopes of generations of Cubs fans or 108 years without a title.
The Nationals, on the other hand, enter this year's playoffs with a countdown clock hanging over them. Harper is only 13 months from reaching free agency, and it may be that this particular group of Washington players have only two more Octobers together -- after a lot of recent playoff frustration. The Nationals reached the postseason in 2012, in the season in which Strasburg was shut down, and they were knocked out in the Division Series. They got back to the playoffs in 2014, and once again, they didn't get through the first round. Last year, they had an epic five-game battle with the Dodgers in the Division Series, and lost.
Washington has a lot of great players, including some future Hall of Famers, and they've been demonstrably better than the Cubs during the regular season. But for the first time in a long time, the Cubs can say this: Their success and postseason experience will be a weapon, against a team that is desperate for its first October success.
The Cubs vs. their defensive limitations
In 2016, the Cubs were an historically great defensive team, with 82 Defensive Runs Saved, 31 more than the second-best team. This year, the Cubs ranked fifth among 30 teams, with 30 Defensive Runs Saved, and Maddon has some imperfect defensive options to chose from -- especially in the outfield. Jon Jay finished the season strongly at the plate, but they are limited as an outfielder. Ian Happ had a tremendous rookie performance, but Happ, an infielder for most of their time in pro ball, tends to make mistakes in reading fly balls when they play center. Only two outfielders rated lower than Kyle Schwarber in Defensive Runs Saved -- Matt Kemp and Khris Davis. Zobrist, 36, will catch what they can get to, but like Jay, he's not a plus defender. Zobrist played only 360 innings in the outfield this season, and yet ranks in the bottom third in Defensive Runs Saved.
Kris Bryant vs. Sean Doolittle
As some evaluators debated the wisdom of the recent industry obsession with launch angle, Bryant has always been held out as a outlier. As a child, they built an uppercut into their swing -- they liked the idea of hitting home runs, they recalled, and was rewarded for them by their grandfather -- and so they have the ability to get to pitches in the upper half of the strike zone and lift them.
Doolittle also is an outlier. They probably work near or at the top of the strike zone as much as any reliever in baseball, an attack plan of extreme success. In 30 innings with the Nationals, he's allowed just 21 hits and eight walks, with 31 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.40.
If Doolittle and Bryant face each other, it will be a test of opposing strengths: Doolittle's northern-hemisphere fastball against Bryant's powerful uppercut.
Robbie Ray vs. the wild-card game ripples
David Dennis/Icon Sportswire
As they dominated the Dodgers in the final six games between the two teams, outscoring L.A. 40-13 while going 6-0, it seemed the Diamondbacks were setting up an ideal situation for themselves: If they won the wild-card game with Zack Greinke, then Ray -- a lefty who totally dominated the Dodgers in four outings during the regular season -- could start Game 1 against Clayton Kershaw and then perhaps Game 4.
But Greinke was knocked out early in the wild card and Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo had to call on Ray to help beat the Rockies. Now Ray won't start Game 1; rather, he's likely to get the ball for Game 2 and, if necessary, Game 5. It's not what the Diamondbacks would've preferred, and additionally, Greinke's quick exit from the wild-card game raises even more questions about their fade late in the season. Arizona is dangerous against the Dodgers, but there may be a clear advantage with the Dodgers' rotation as this series begins.
The Dodgers vs. the 7th- and 8th-inning bullpen challenges
Dave Roberts' team ran away with the NL West, despite the late-season slump, and their bullpen has been really good. Its ERA of 3.38 was the fourth best in baseball. But at the end of the season, the Dodgers' relief situation in front of closer Kenley Jansen seemed surprisingly unsettled, with Ross Stripling, Tony Watson, Tony Cingrani, Pedro Baez, Josh Fields and Walker Buehler all auditioning for various roles. The Dodgers' depth was an enormous advantage for them all season, but interestingly, in the postseason L.A. might revert back to the old-school formula of relying on starting pitchers to get as as deep into the game as possible, with the last three to six outs turned over to Jansen.
Brandon Morrow was a strong option for the Dodgers all season and they could play a crucial bridge role this month, with their 100 mph fastball. Morrow did not allow a run in their last nine appearances of the regular season, and they surrendered a run in just one outing after Aug. 12.
Fernando Rodney vs. the Dodgers' hitters
There's no getting around this: In an October filled with the best relievers in baseball, Rodney is the hope-and-pray closer of this postseason, and in a big spot, they might need some Pixie Dust to get through the Dodgers' lineup. They pitched 8 1/3 innings against the Dodgers in 10 games, allowing eight hits, seven walks and eight runs, for an 8.64 ERA. In their brief career, Corey Seager is 3-for-4 against Rodney; Justin Turner is 2-for-4, Yasiel Puig is 3-for-8. Arizona could probably use as much padding as possible for those times when Rodney is called on to close out the Dodgers.
Clayton Kershaw vs. J.D. Martinez
Kershaw is perhaps the greatest pitcher of all time, and coming off another excellent season -- and he's left-handed. Martinez has destroyed left-handed pitching this season, batting .376 with an .892 slugging percentage. Seriously, that is not a misprint: 10 doubles, 1 triple and 12 homers in 93 at-bats against lefties, with a 1.356 OPS. In Martinez's career against Kershaw, he's 3-for-8, with a double, a home run and a walk.
Once, a water bottle thrown at Justin Bieber would've forced the “Baby” singer to storm off stage. But Bieber is wiser, and calmer now: Witness their reaction at Sweden's Summerburst Festival, when they informed the crowd they couldn't play “Despacito,” their #1 single with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. “I don't know the song,” they said. “I can't do it.” After the disclosure, a water bottle is whipped from the crowd… but Bieber dodges it, and goes on with their business. Watch it below, crowd shrieking and all.
It's the latest, popularized incident of Bieber not knowing the words to their smash hit. Last month, they were filmed swapping in lyrics like “blah blah blah blah blah” (fun) and “I don't know the words so I say burrito” (racist) when singing the song at a New York club. Can they go for the threepeat? [Mashable]

The 91-page report from California's state auditor, Elaine Howle, also said the state Department of Water Resources “has not completed either an economic or financial analysis to demonstrate the financial viability” of the project, which the Brown administration calls the California WaterFix.
Also, the Brown administration has not put in place a proper system of governance for the project, and has failed to keep important documents, the audit found.
The audit further concluded that the state Department of Water Resources “did not follow state law” when it replaced a key program manager on the project with a company that it hired without a competitive bidding process and which was run by somebody without an engineering degree.
State officials disputed that they violated the law, and said the project is on track.
“The department has already taken action based on the auditor's feedback and will take their recommendations under advisement as it moves forward with WaterFix,” said Erin Mellon, a spokesperson for the state Department of Water Resources.
Mellon said the audit “validates the unprecedented and exhaustive work the department has done to propose the best project for the state of California.”
Environmental groups had a different view.
“California WaterFix is in complete disarray,” said Barbara Barrigan-Parilla, executive director of Restore the Delta, a Stockton organization that opposes the tunnels. “We cannot see how any public water agency can vote to support any percentage of this project.”
The audit noted that the Brown administration hired the Hallmark Group, a Sacramento consulting firm, to run a key part of the planning and oversight for the project. The company, which was recommended by Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, had managed projects at UC Merced, but had no experience managing large water projects. It's president, Chuck Gardner, has a bachelor's degree in economics. The company was given a no-bid contract that has tripled in cost from $4 million to $13 million.

Thursday's audit comes at a critical time for the plan, which is one of Brown's two giant legacy construction proposals, the other being their high-speed rail project.
Last month, the tunnels plan took a significant hit when the board of Westlands Water District in Fresno, the nation's largest agricultural irrigation district, voted 7-1 not to participate in its funding. Westlands had been expected to contribute roughly $3 billion toward the cost. That means that other water agencies — including Silicon Valley's largest water supplier — that are trying to decide whether to help fund the project would have to pay more and raise customers' water rates and property taxes higher than expected to cover the costs, along with any cost overruns.
On Tuesday, the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a supporter of the project that provides water to 19 million people, is scheduled to vote on whether to help pay at least $4 billion fund it. Thursday, Brown met personally with 17 of the district's 38 board members in Granada Hills to urge them for a yes vote.
Then on Oct. 17, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, whose costs could range from $600 million to $1 billion, is set to vote. But the agency's chairperson said Thursday that it may now delay that vote.
“The audit raises questions that our board needs to evaluate,” John Varela, chairperson of the Santa Clara Valley Water District.
“We represent 2 million people,” Varela said. “We want to be certain that what we do as a board is not going to have a major financial impact on our ratepayers. We want to be fair to them. That is our biggest concern.”
The Santa Clara Valley Water District, which is based in San Jose, is the wholesale water provider for a dozen agencies, including cities like Santa Clara and private companies like San Jose Water Company. The district is also considering plans to build a new reservoir near Pacheco Pass, expand the use of recycled water, form a partnership with other agencies to expand Los Vaqueros Reservoir in Contra Costa County and continue to expand its conservation efforts.
“We have to look at all of our options moving forward to provide an adequate water supply as our county continues to grow,” Varela said.
Other big Bay Area water districts, like East Bay Municipal Utility District and the Contra Costa Water District, are not part of the project.
The Delta tunnels plan, begun under former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, would build two tunnels, each 35 miles long and 40 feet high, under the Delta, the vast system of channels and sloughs between the Bay Area and Sacramento where the state's two largest rivers, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin, meet.
In 2009, the Department of Water Resources announced the project would cost $140 million to plan, design and permit. So far, it has cost twice that, $280 million, Thursday's audit reported. That cost has come from water districts around the state, and the federal Bureau of Reclamation.
The idea is that the tunnels would take water from the Sacramento River, south of Sacramento near the town of Courtland, and move it to the huge pumps near Tracy that are part of the State Water Project and Central Valley Project. That, supporters say, would reduce reliance on the pumps and make water deliveries more reliable by protecting endangered salmon, smelt and other fish, which can be killed by the pumps. Protecting the fish leads to reduced pumping.
But critics call the tunnels a huge boondoggle that will eventually allow large agribusiness interests in the San Joaquin Valley, as well as urban users in Los Angeles, to take more water out of the Delta, regardless of what promises are made now.
Complicating Brown's plans, their administration has not been able to guarantee that the tunnels will allow any more water to be pumped out of the Delta than is being pumped out now — roughly 50 percent of all its fresh water in most years.
Farm districts and city water agencies have looked at the costs and dozens of lawsuits already filed against the project, and calculated how much debt they would incur. Some wonder if they can spend the money more efficiently, or support a smaller project, even as they face increasing pressure from Brown and their staff to approve the plan as the governor's final 15 months in office wind down.

ISLAMABAD: An accountability court (AC) of Islamabad Monday summoned two more prosecution witnesses on December 19 to testify in references filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against former prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and their family members.
AC judge Muhammad Bashir resumed hearing of three references pertaining to Avenfield property, Flagship Investment and Al-Azizia Steel Mills. Captain (r) Muhammad Safdar appeared before the court along with their legal team while former prime minister and their daughter Maryam Nawaz were not in attendance due to their visit to inquire after the health of Kulsoom Nawaz in London.
The cross-examination of two NAB witnesses who recorded their statements in Flagship Investment and Al-Azizia Steel Mills references, was completed.
Defence counsel Khwaja Harris asked prosecution witness Malik Tayyab Ahmed, who recorded their statement and submitted documents last week, whether they knew the people who had brought the cheques issued by the former prime minister to him.
The witness had read out from the available documents while recording the statement. Except a few, all the documents were prepared in the absence of Tayyab, they contended.
Malik Tayyab apprised the court that they personally did not know the people, who had brought cheques to him, and they had recorded the statement in accordance with the available documents.
With regards to the Flagship reference, Nawaz's counsel demanded a verified copy of the statement recorded by a witness Afaq Ahmed before the Panama Papers case joint investigation team.
The NAB prosecutor said the statement was submitted to the Supreme Court and asked for some time to submit its verified copy to the accountability court.
Moreover, the statement of witness Adeel Akhtar was also recorded by the court.
Later, the court adjourned the hearing of all three references till December 19 and summoned prosecution witnesses Yasir Shabbir and Shakeel Anjum in the Al Azizia reference in the next hearing.—APP
White Bear Lake (US): Prosecutors say a Minnesota man lived in their house with the decomposing bodies of their mother and twin brother for about a year.
Sixty-year-old Robert James Kuefler of White Bear Lake is charged with interference with a dead body or scene of death because they neglected to tell authorities they died of natural causes, according to the St Paul Pioneer Press.
The bodies were found last year. Kuefler was charged this week. Police say they told them their mother, 94-year-old Evelyn Kuefler, died in August 2015 and their brother, Richard Kuefler, died before that and they couldn't bring themselves to bury them.
The complaint says their mother's body was decayed and skeletal and their brother's body was "mummified."
Alabama coach Nick Saban explains why Lane Kiffin will not be running the Tide's offense in the national championship game. (1:46)
Lane Kiffin will not be coaching the Alabama offense when the Crimson Tide take on Clemson in the College Football Playoff National Championship on Jan. 9.
Kiffin has already accepted the head-coaching job at Florida Atlantic University, but they were expected to continue at Alabama through the end of the season. Alabama coach Nick Saban said Steve Sarkisian, who had already been named Kiffin's successor, will be in charge of Alabama's game plan for the championship game.
"We made the decision because it was in the best interest of our players, our program and for Lane for them to assume their duties at Florida Atlantic," Saban told ESPN on Monday. "We mutually agreed that this was best for both programs."
Editor's Picks Has Lane Kiffin grown up? Lane Kiffin's FAU head coaching tenure begins a week earlier than expected after Nick Saban announced their controversial offensive coordinator would not coach in the title game.
Kiffin had been late to several events in the past week leading up to Alabama's 24-7 CFP semifinal win against Washington in the Peach Bowl -- including meetings and media day -- leading some Alabama staff members to say they "were done with him," sources told ESPN's Brett McMurphy.
On Thursday, Kiffin appeared 15 minutes late to the team's Peach Bowl media day and was the last Alabama coach to leave the event. By the time they got out of the Georgia Dome locker room to where the buses were supposed to be, they were already headed back to the team hotel in downtown Atlanta.
Kiffin said they expect an easy transition for Sarkisian, noting how Sarkisian's personality should mesh better with Saban's than theirs did.
"I'm not saying it's bad with them at all," Kiffin said. "I would say Sark manages people better than I do."
"This wasn't an easy decision and we appreciate the way Lane handled this in terms of doing what is best for our team," Saban said in a statement. "At the end of the day, both of us wanted to put our players in the best position to be successful. Obviously, we are in a unique situation here where we have our next offensive coordinator already on staff. We have full confidence that Sark will step in right away and make this a smooth transition."

The move came after an uneven offensive performance in Saturday's win over Washington in which quarterback Jalen Hurts passed for a season-low 57 yards. Saban could be seen on the sideline yelling at Kiffin after a three-and-out on the opening series, the latest incident in what sometimes was a contentious relationship between the coaches.
Kiffin, who credits Saban for showing them how to handle an entire program as a head coach, joked last week that they couldn't recall any fond memories at Alabama, only the so-called "ass-chewings" Saban gave them from time to time.
Several Alabama staff members were "dumbfounded" about those Kiffin comments, sources told McMurphy, and also Kiffin's comments that "fun is not a word we use around here."
In past weeks, Alabama sources told ESPN that Kiffin would not have been allowed to return after this season. However, Kiffin said at their FAU introductory news conference and at the Peach Bowl events that those reports were not true.
"I don't know where that came from: that the Kiffin-Saban marriage had run its course," Kiffin said last week.
Kiffin reiterated in the statement that this is the best move for everyone.
"After going through these last couple of weeks, trying to serve the best interests of two universities as an offensive coordinator and a head coach, it became apparent that both programs would be better served by me giving all my time and efforts to being the head coach at FAU," Kiffin said. "After meeting with Coach Saban during preparations last night and this morning, we mutually decided that it was in everyone's best interests for the players and the program for Coach Sarkisian to take over all responsibilities as offensive coordinator for the championship game.
"This was a very difficult decision, but it's a decision made in the best interests of the program. I look forward to helping Alabama win another championship, and would like to thank Coach Saban, the staff and all the players and fans for the past three years at UA for an unforgettable time and championship run. Roll Tide!"

According to multiple reports in the local media, talks are ongoing between Zylofon Media owner, Nana Appiah Mensah and the Ghana Football Association on the number of years the business guru want to sponsor the Ghana Premier League.
Report says the country's football governing body wants Zylofon to sponsor the league for five years, with negotiations ongoing between both parties.
However, a press conference to announce the sponsorship package will be held on Thursday, April 26, 2018, if both parties come to an agreement.
On Saturday, Nana Appiah Mensah announced their intention to sponsor the Ghana Premier League when they visited the junior national teams at their camping base at the Ghanaman Soccer Center of Excellence at Prampram and donated GH₵200,000 to the Black Satellites and the Black Starlets apart from their preparations towards the African qualifiers.
The business guru broke the news of sponsoring the Ghana Premier League through one of their able lieutenants, Frederick Boateng.
“On behalf of Nana Appiah Mensah and their team, I would like to announce that Zylofon will be sponsoring the Ghana Premier League.
President of the Ghana Football Association, Kwesi Nyantakyi was appreciative of Nana Appiah Mensah's will to support the Ghana Premier League after the announcement was made.
“We thank Nana for this kind gesture; we hope that we will build on that to develop the league, and we pray that God blesses them so they can continue to support the league.
“We are discussing three to five years and the details will be announced to the public within the week”, they added.
Nana Appiah Mensah is the owner of Division One side Star Madrid FC and other fast-growing businesses.
LEWISBURG — To celebrate its upcoming bicentennial, the Village of Lewisburg held a vintage baseball game on Saturday, May 19.
The village is holding monthly events during this bicentennial year. Past events so far have included: an Abe Lincoln impersonator, a euchre tournament, and the Bicentennial Tea.
According to Diane Trittschuh, Bicentennial Historic Encampments and Reenactment Chairperson, even with the threat of rain, approximately 150 t0 200 spectators attended the game and stayed during the occasional downpours.
They added, “It was a huge success. The event was something different that all ages enjoyed. Numerous attendees commented on how much they enjoyed the teams, the game and that they had a lot of fun. After the game, the Clodbusters invited the children to participate in a child'sbase ball game. The children batted and the Clodbusters fielded.'
“The game was provided to the public free of charge with funds raised from sales at the Lewisburg Bicentennial Store, holding Fifty-Fifty raffles, and donations from business and individuals. All of our monthly events and our three day Bicentennial Event being held September 7, 8 and 9, 2018 are provided to the public free of charge,” they said.
The teams which played were the Dayton Clodbusters Base Ball Club and the Cincinnati Blackbottom Nine Vintage Base Ball Club. The Dayton Clodbusters were formed in 1989 and are based out of Carillon Historical Park. The Blackbottom Nine were formed in 2009 and are based out of Dori Field in Norwood.
According to Trittschuh, the teams play by official rules established in the 1860s (no glove, underhand pitch, etc.) and pay strict attention to old-fashioned laws of sportsmanship and family fun. They dress in the 1860s era uniforms.
At that time, the game was spelled “Base Ball” as two separate words. They play with the highest standards of sportsmanship and gentlemanly behavior. Their equipment is made to the standards of the period. They utilize the rules, customs and terminology of baseball's earliest days.
“Both teams commented the game was a big success and it was a fun crowd. The teams enjoyed themselves. They were pleased with the number of attendees and the setting. The Bicentennial Committee provided a pizza party for both teams after the game and presented each player with a Lewisburg Bicentennial Commemorative coin and custom made baseball and bat cookies,” Trittschuh said.
“The Bicentennial Committee worked on planning this event for two years. The baseball teams have a busy schedule so this type of event needs to be planned far in advance. The Village of Lewisburg passed out free water bottles to the spectators with the Lewisburg Bicentennial logo.
“The volunteers who helped with the game were members of the Lewisburg Bicentennial Committee, the TCN Community Association, the Lewisburg Historical Society and the Village of Lewisburg. Our community donated wonderful desserts for the team pizza party.
“Many volunteers dressed in the 1800s era clothing which contributed to the vintage atmosphere at the game.We have an extremely supportive and hospitable community.”
The next scheduled bicentennial event is an ice cream social and car show at the TCN Community Center and the Lewisburg Historical Society on Sunday, June 10, at noon.

Producer James Hinton, aka The Range, is the latest artist to take part in the on-going Our First 100 Days compilation. For their contribution, the Brooklyn-based electronic musician served up a “redo” version of “Retune”, a track from their stand-out 2016 album, Potential. The bright wonder of the original is somewhat muted in this new take, though it's still there beating under the chopped vocals and spritely synths. Perhaps that's a bit more fitting given the current political milieu, where it seems like everyone is having to fight that much harder for just a little feeling of positivity and hope.

Designated the "Eighth Wonder of the World" upon its opening, the Houston Astrodome was officially named a Texas Historic Landmark in a ceremony that took place yesterday afternoon.
Opened in 1965, it was originally known as the Harris County Domed Stadium before the then Houston Colt .45s moved to it in 1965. The team changed their names to the Astros, and the stadium changed its name to the Astrodome. The Astrodome was, at the time, the world's first domed stadium, and the largest dome on the planet. It featured luxury suites, and was the first to feature an artificial playing surface.
Last year, the Astrodome received a "state antiquities landmark designation," which provided with it special safeguards against demolition, and also further required the approval of the Texas Historical Commission for any future changes. Now, the Historic Landmark designation protects the building even more.
Mike Vance, member of the Harris County Historical Commission, said "The Dome has never had an actual historical marker. The Astrodome is the most important building we've ever had in our city's history. It's the most recognized and the most influential building that we've ever had."

Why Broken Matt has been more 'wonderful' than Woken Matt

Matt & Jeff Hardy make a shocking return to WWE: WrestleMania 33
The long anticipated yet surprise return of the Hardys at WrestleMania garnered a significant applause from the fans. With Matt Hardy's appearance in Bleached hair that was characteristic of their 'Broken' look in Impact Wrestling, it seemed the arrival of the gimmick wasn't far behind. However, just when copyright issues made it seem like it was something that wouldn't happen, Impact Wrestling gave up the rights of the gimmick thus allowing it to be used in the WWE. Although Hardy has been using the gimmick since then, it hasn't been as successful as it was in its earlier incarnation.
The WWE has had a long relationship with Impact Wrestling with the two creating inspired storylines and often at times, straightaway lifting gimmicks. While imitation is oftentimes considered to be the 'sincerest form of flattery', we often wish someone came up with original ideas instead of using the same gimmick on the same superstar. When you come to think of it, Impact Wrestling's rendition of 'Broken' Matt Hardy was one of the best Gimmicks in recent memory of wrestling fans. However, the gimmick hasn't been able to capture the fancy of the WWE universe.
In this article, we take a look at five reasons which did not allow the gimmick to be as successful in the WWE as it was in Impact Wrestling.
Lack of a proper Background pilot
The Gimmick had a solid background in Impact Wrestling
The introduction of the 'Broken' gimmick was a well-planned decision that had time to evolve into the character that we know today. If we look at it closely, Jeff's Willow gimmick was pretty over with the fans as well. Matt Hardy turning broken was leveraged well when they attacked Jeff disguised as an imposter Willow.
Coming to the introduction of the 'Woken' gimmick in the WWE, it seemed rather forced as well as rushed. The 'Woken' persona getting 'triggered' in a confrontation with Bray Wyatt seemed rather out of context. It seemed like WWE was desperate to get the gimmick in action as soon as Matt gained the rights to use it.

LAHORE: The Nawa-i-Waqt Fund for Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh received Rs30,000 on Monday.
ZA Zubairi from Lahore donated Rs20,000 while Peruz Bakht Qazi contributed Rs10,000.
APRIL 24, 2018 — Louisiana-based shipbuilder Metal Shark has delivered two new custom welded aluminum vessels to the Virgin Islands Port Authority (VIPA), a 45 ft pilot boat and 32 ft port security boat
Built at the company's Jeanerette, LA, shipyard both vessels are now operating from the Edward Wilmoth Blyden IV Marine Facility on the Charlotte Amalie waterfront where they serve the island of St. Thomas and also nearby St. John.
The new pilot boat is a 45-foot Defiant-class monohull pilothouse vessel with a military-proven hull design and a unique deck arrangement specifically designed for pilot operations.
The vessel's climate-controlled pilothouse features Metal Shark's signature "pillarless glass" for significantly improved visibility, in a reverse-raked arrangement developed by Metal Shark with input from numerous pilot groups. Visibility is further augmented by the vessel's elevated, centerline helm position. Large opening side and aft pilothouse windows and a wireless crew communication headset system facilitate crew coordination during pilot transfers, and large overhead skylights provide upward visibility while approaching and operating alongside moving ships.
Fully flush non-skid decks allow for unimpeded access around the vessel, and handrails have been placed within easy reach of all crew, inside the cabin and outside on deck, at all times. Low-level LED pathway lighting enhances safety during nighttime operation. The vessel's large, functional swim platform, plus easily accessible Jason's Cradle, dive ladder, and throwable life rings, are intended to assure quick and safe crew retrieval in the event of a man overboard situation.
Powered by twin Cummins Marine QSM11 diesel engines coupled with Hamilton HJ322 waterjets, the 45 Defiant Pilot demonstrates precise maneuverability while delivering a cruise speed in excess of 30 knots and a top speed in the 40 knot range. A urethane-sheathed, closed-cell foam Wing collar provides durable and resilient fendering. Shock-mitigating seating has been provided for a crew of five, and anti-fatigue floor covering has been provided in the pilothouse and the belowdecks crew spaces. Additional features include a galley, enclosed head compartment, v-berth, and large walk-in mid-cabin storage compartment.
VIPA has named its new pilot boat the "George Freeman" in honor of its first coxswain, George Elwin Freeman Sr., who worked for VIPA for 33 years until their passing in 2000.
PORT SECURITY BOAT
For its new port security patrol boat, VIPA selected Metal Shark's 32' Defiant, a proven patrol platform with over 100 units in military and law enforcement service worldwide.
Funded in part by a FEMA Port Security Grant, the vessel has been outfitted with a postivie-pressure Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high-yield Explosive (CBRNE) crew protection system to assure safe and uninterrupted operation in a wide range of disaster response scenarios.

Like its larger 45' pilot boat sibling, VIPA's 32' port security boat features Metal Shark's pillarless pilothouse glass to significantly reduce blind spots compared to conventional pilothouse designs which use smaller, framed windows. Shock-mitigating seating has been provided for a crew of four inside the vessel's climate-controlled cabin.
Powered by twin Evinrude E-TEC G2 300 HP outboard engines, VIPA's 32 Defiant port security vessel cruises at 35 knots and achieves top speeds approaching 50 knots.
"Metal Shark has expanded into the pilot boat market by applying the same principles that made us so successful in the military patrol boat sector," said Metal Shark's CEO Chris Allard. "We start with a proven hull design to deliver a boat that performs well and is built to last. Beyond that, we focus on offering genuine improvements by incorporating modern features into smarter and more user friendly arrangements that simply work better than what's out there. We continue to gain customers in new markets by delivering improved platforms that deliver tangible and sometimes unexpected benefits to operators."
"Both of these vessels offer significant improvements over the boats they're replacing, in terms of crew safety, comfort, and efficiency,and port operations will undoubtedly be enhanced as a result of these acquisitions," said Carl Wegener, Metal Shark's Vice President of Commercial Sales.

Pro cyclists in the inaugural Colorado Classic men's race will cover 313 miles (503.5 km) and endure more than 20,000 feet of intense, high-altitude climbing in four stages that showcase the state's incredible terrain and enhance viewing and entertainment options for fans, race organizers announced today.
The Colorado Classic race routes will test the field and create new and unique experiences for spectators over the race's four-day run, August 10-13. Courses start and finish from the same location — as opposed to point-to-point races — and stages 1, 2 and 4 are “circuits” featuring multiple laps on challenging courses. As such, the Colorado Classic promises repeated opportunities for fans to see the riders up close over the course of the event.
“Each course will give fans numerous opportunities in a single day to see the sport's top riders,” said David Koff, CEO of RPM Events Group, the organization formed to put on the race. “And the start-finish areas are being built to be magnets of activity before, during, and after each race. Our goal is to have you come out for one experience, and to stick around for many, many more.”
The Colorado Classic is sanctioned by Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and designated as a 2.HC race, which is the highest category outside of World Tour races.
Stage one will cover a total of 93.5 miles (150.4 km) as riders push the pace for six laps on a 15.58-mile (25.1 km) course in the shadow of Pikes Peak, running between downtown Colorado Springs and the sandstone formations of the city's iconic Garden of the Gods.
Stage two will be a test of endurance and willpower over 64 miles (103 km) in the scenic mining town of Breckenridge. During 10 laps on the 6.4-mile (10.3 km) course, riders will face more than 7,000 feet of climbing, including multiple, leg-crushing runs up the notorious Moonstone climb — and the subsequent thrilling descents down Illinois Gulch.
The action moves to Denver for the stages 3 and 4 of the men's race, as the Colorado Classic anchors the first-ever Velorama Festival: a 3-day bike, music, and craft festival in the city's RiNo Art District. From August 11-13, Velorama will feature musical acts; some of the world's best cyclists competing in the final two stages of the Colorado Classic; and hundreds of vendors in a festival marketplace that includes a Bike and Lifestyle Expo and is anchored by the Denver Flea and the independent craft makers of beer, cider and wine in the Drink RiNo group.
Stage three will be contested on an 81-mile (130 km) out-and-back course that runs from the RiNo race hub to the mountains west of Denver on the Peak to Peak Highway, and then returns to the Mile High City through scenic Golden Gate Canyon State Park and via what is expected to be a finishing sprint through the streets of Denver, with speeds approaching 60 mph. Among the day's highlights will be race action on Gap Road in the foothills west of Denver. On that stretch, riders will face the toughest part of the course, or King of the Mountain (KOM) section, and dirt roads with steep, rolling hills.
Stage four will once again highlight the start-and-finish area within the Velorama Festival grounds and send riders on a 7.5-mile (12km) city circuit that stretches from RiNo to City Park and back. Riders will do 10 laps in the final stage, for a total of 74.6 miles (120.1 km) on what is expected to be a thrilling, intense, and colorful final day of racing.
The four-day race will be televised on NBCSN and live streamed on NBC Sports Gold — NBC Sports Digital's live streaming direct-to-consumer subscription app. Paul Sherwen will call the action, joined by analyst Christian Vande Velde and reporter Bob Roll.
The two stages of the women's Colorado Classic will be conducted on similar courses to stages 1 & 2 of the men's course.
Stage one of the women's race will cover 38.36 miles (61.7 km) over multiple laps in Colorado Springs, and will send a field of the best women cyclists through the Garden of the Gods.
The second and final stage will cover 32 miles (51.5 km) over five laps on the Breckenridge course, with riders conquering Moonstone hill over and over again.
The Denver start-finish area is within the ticketed Velorama Festival grounds and will provide incredible vantage points for catching the race action. Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Old 97's and the Jayhawks will headline three rockin' days of music with tickets, which also provide access to the race start-finish line and the festival marketplace, available online at VeloramaColorado.com.
No admission is being charged to the start-finish areas in Colorado Springs and Breckenridge, and cycling fans will find countless areas to cheer on racers for free from alongside the courses in all four stages.

Even as there are stringent emission norms for vehicular traffic on the roads, with the courts intervening time and again to control air pollution, the fisheries department has no mechanism to monitor emissions by trawlers.
There are over 1,500 trawlers registered with the directorate of fisheries in the state and the diesel-run engines of these trawlers, which are provided diesel at a subsidised rate, do not come under the ambit of pollution norms.
Highly placed sources in the know, requesting anonymity, said that while the engines used in the trawlers are mostly imported from China, the fisheries department has no mechanism in place to monitor the emission norms of these engines.
The sources said that nobody knows as to which emission standards the engines meet; even the dealers are not aware of the emission norms of the engines. The sources said that there is a high possibility of the trawler engines not meeting the international standards of emission. These trawlers are making their entry into the Indian fishing industry due to the loopholes in the Fishing Act, as there are no proper guidelines and monitoring systems. Speaking to this daily, director of the fisheries department Shamila Monteiro said that the trawlers do not come under the ambit of emission norms and the department is not keeping a check on the same, as there is no provision under the Fishing Act.
Replying to a question on high-powered engines being used for fishing, they said that the trawlers have to obtain a fitness certificate or seaworthy certificate through the Captain of Ports. They said that there is no provision under the Act to curtail the power of engines above 300 BHP.
On bull-trawling, Monteiro said that the department is keeping a check on LED lights being used for fishing and bull-trawling, by conducting regular patrolling. They also said that the coastal police and Coast Guard have been directed to ensure that the ban is implemented strictly.
FILE PHOTO: Migrants wait to disembark from a vessel of ONG Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta, Italy, June 24, 2016.
ROME (Reuters) - Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Saturday it was suspending its migrant rescues in the Mediterranean because it felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard and the Italian government's policies have made its job harder.
The aid group's decision is the latest development in mounting tensions between Rome and NGOs as migration dominates Italy's political agenda ahead of elections early next year.
"We are suspending our activities because now we feel that the threatening behaviour by the Libyan coastguard is very serious ... we cannot put our colleagues in danger," the president of MSF's Italian arm Loris De Filippi told Reuters.
Almost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years, the vast majority setting sail from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.
Charity boats have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014.
However, Italy fears the groups are facilitating people smuggling and encouraging migrants to make the passage, and it has proposed a Code of Conduct governing how they operate.
Some groups, including MSF, have refused to sign the code.
They object to a requirement that Italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves, rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues.
MSF operates one rescue ship in the Mediterranean, the Prudence, currently docked in the Sicilian port of Catania.
In the last six weeks the number of migrant arrivals in Italy has slowed sharply and Rome has begun collaborating more closely with the Libyan coastguard, which De Filippi said was threatening the NGOs and preventing them from working.
They said the Libyan coastguard had demanded the NGOs should leave an area of up to hundreds of kilometres around its coast, whereas previously they had been allowed to conduct search and rescue operations as close as 11 nautical miles to the mainland.
"Last year the coastguard fired 13 shots on our boat and that was in a situation that was much calmer than the present one," said De Filippi.
They said MSF would continue its collaboration with another aid group, SOS Mediterranee, which operates a rescue ship in the Mediterranean with MSF doctors on board.
De Filippi said the Rome government's Code of Conduct for NGOs and its support for the Libyan coastguard showed it was now mixing the humanitarian goal of saving lives with "a political and military intention" of reducing arrivals.
"We refuse to be co-opted into a system that blocks people from seeking safety and protection," MSF tweeted, adding that the European Union's immigration policies showed it was "determined to trap people in Libya."
Oscar Camps, the founder of Proactiva Open Arms, another aid group active in the Mediterranean, also took aim at the EU, tweeting: "the first NGO out, this is just what the EU wants."
An Italian government spokesperson was not immediately available to comment, while Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, said MSF's move meant there would be "thousands fewer illegal immigrants for Italians to maintain."
Last week Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.
General Khalifa Haftar, a commander aligned with an Eastern-based parliament, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Saturday the presence of Italian military vessels in Libyan waters was unacceptable but they would not attack them.

GENEVA - The Geneva-based non-governmental organization Press Emblem Campaign (PEC) on Tuesday said that at least 66 journalists were killed in 22 countries in the fist half of this year, up 32 percent compared with the same period of last year.
PEC said that five countries represent more than half of the fatalities: Afghanistan, Mexico, Syria, the United States and Yemen.
Terrorist groups in Afghanistan and criminal groups in Mexico bear the main responsibility of the high price paid by media workers, the organization said, adding that while in Yemen and Syria, journalists were killed in fighting while covering the ongoing conflict.
In the United States, however, a climate of hatred against the media could have caused the deadly attack on a Maryland newspaper, it said. Founded in June 2004, the PEC aims to strengthen the legal protection and safety of journalists in conflict zones, areas of civil unrest, or on dangerous missions.

Christians across the country thronged churches to celebrate Easter Sunday.
The clergy took the occasion — the commemoration of the resurrection of of Jesus Christ — to call for peace and reconciliation as the country heads to the August General Election.
At the Holy Family Basilica, the Archbishop of Nairobi John Cardinal Njue, urged Kenyans to embrace the spirit of forgiveness.
“Let the period between now and the elections be days of reflection and renewal,” said Njue.
They said as the country prepares for the poll, it is important for politicians to watch their language to avoid plunging the country into chaos.
The Catholic Church head urged Kenyans to avoid being divided by leaders who may employ divisive tactics in a bid to be elected.
They also urged inclusivity and tolerance in the run up to the elections.
“We have in the past witnessed divisions during elections. But we want to urge Kenyans to shun those who may want to cause chaos and instead cultivate tolerance between those who hold divergent political views,” they said.
Bribing youth
At the All Saints Cathedral, the head of the Anglican Church Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit also preached the message of peace.
They said the church is concerned about the rise in incidents of violence and threats, especially in rural areas and warned politicians against inciting supporters.
“We note with grave concern the tendency of politicians to bribe the youth with cash or cheap alcohol and use them to attack their opponent's supporters.
We, therefore, urge the youth to play their rightful role in this democratic process by voting in leaders who have their interests at heart and not politicians who are out to misuse them to cause violence,” said Sapit.
Tone down
They said the signs witnessed so far in the campaigns are not encouraging and asked political players to tone down their rhetoric.
“We have witnessed incitementsand violence in some parts of the country. The negative political mobilisation witnessed across the country is polarising as it is based on name calling, insults and violence. As a church, we feel that the rising political temperatures is not good,” they added.
Defensive talent Callum Buglass intends to swap one end of NIHL Division One South for the other.
The 21 year-old has become Phantoms' latest new recruit for the 2018/19 campaign and arrives at Planet Ice with a big reputation.
Scott Robson is returning to Phantoms next season.
 They are also well known to head coach Slava Koulikov from the Great Britain Under 20 set-up.
Buglass earned plenty of admirers for their performances when part of the rock-bottom Cardiff Fire side last term, but their sights are now firmly fixed on challenging for title glory with Phantoms.
“I'm very excited to start a new chapter in my hockey career,” said Buglass, who is a product of the Cardiff Devils junior system and has also represented Swindon in the second tier of the sport.
“I can't wait to meet up with the guys and get the season started. We'll be working hard in every single game to try to win silverware for the fans.
“I'm really happy to be working with Slava and believe they can improve my game a lot.”
Buglass is a replacement for the impressive Ed Knaggs, who has been ruled out of a Phantoms return due to work commitments and a high amount of travelling.
Koulikov reckons the club had to fight off rival interest from the Elite League and NIHL to secure Buglass' signature and they are delighted to have retained the services of another defenceman, Scott Robson, for a fifth consecutive season.
The 22 year-old is also understood to have been a wanted man during the close season, but they have opted to remain in Bretton.
Koulikov said: “It's great to be able to bring Callum to the club, while ‘Robbo' is part of the core group of guys we wanted to keep for next season.
“I've been tracking Callum for some time and it was no surprise to me that so many clubs – including some in the Elite League – were chasing him.
“I'm really happy they wanted to come here and I firmly believe there is plenty more to come from him.
“We're also delighted to have held onto Robbo. They caught the eye of many teams in the league, but we are thrilled they have made the decision to stay.”

AJACCIO, France (Reuters) - A group of ten-year-old schoolchildren on the Mediterranean island of Corsica proudly raised their hands in class one morning this week to say they felt Corsican, not French.
Their teacher, Nathalie Lanfranchi, grew up speaking French at home but now talks with their daughters in Corsican and teaches in both languages in this school in the outskirts of the island's biggest city, Ajaccio.
In some countries, that would raise few eyebrows.
But for France, a centralised state with a single, national identity and only one official language, Corsica's demand for more autonomy is a challenge.
The children - 11 consider themselves to be only Corsican, one only French and one claims both identities - greeted visitors with a cheerful Corsican “Bonghjornu” rather than the French “Bonjour”.
But President Emmanuel Macron may face a cooler welcome when they visit the island next week after ministers infuriated Corsica's nationalist leaders by refusing several of their demands, including official status for the Corsican language.
“Our goodwill has been taken for weakness by Paris but we are not weak, we are strong with the support of Corsicans,” said regional parliament speaker Jean-Guy Talamoni.
“Corsicans want to be recognised as a nation,” they said, adding that a protest march on Saturday would show just that.
Unlike Spain and Germany, France has always been reluctant to give much power to its regions, despite some decentralisation in the 1980s.
With nationalism on the rise, as in Catalonia and other regions of Europe, Corsicans elected nationalist leaders in December and Macron now faces demands for local powers over issues as varied as taxation and property buying.
NO FRENCH FLAG
While the French tricolour flies over official buildings throughout France, it was not to be seen in Talamoni's office, or on the front of the town hall in Granace, a tiny village of ancient stone houses in southern Corsica.
Instead, mayor Jean-Yves Leandri proudly displayed the black-and-white flag with a Moor's head that symbolises Corsica.
Rather than the tricolour sash French elected officials wear for ceremonial duties, Leandri conducts weddings with one they had specially made, again adorned with a Moor's head. They never went to pick up the portrait of Macron that should be hanging on their wall.
“We took away the French flag, it's got nothing to do here, it's Corsica,” the 54-year-old mayor said.

Leandri, a nationalist since their early 20s, is not the first in their family to be elected mayor of the village of about 100 souls. But they are the first nationalist.
Nationalist groups had staged thousands of attacks over four decades before laying down their weapons in 2014, and it took a long time to convince voters to back nationalist politicians, Leandri said.
“People used to be afraid of us,” they said. They managed to convince people to vote for them only when the violence stopped.
“Now we need to work, and work more than the others, to build a country,” they said.
AUTONOMY OR INDEPENDENCE?
Slideshow (7 Images)
In a sign of how widespread demands for autonomy have become in Corsica, Jean-Andre Miniconi, a local business leader, said authorities on the island needed more powers to boost its economy and deal with specific problems such as higher transport costs and a shortage of affordable housing.
Even the conservative mayor of Ajaccio, Laurent Marcangeli, said they favoured giving the Corsican language official status alongside French, and wanted special status for the island in the French constitution.
But where they differ with nationalists, and where even nationalists disagree among themselves, is on whether autonomy would be enough or if they should aim for independence.
In wealthy Catalonia, which has had wide powers and where Catalan is an official language, Corsica's demands for autonomy would seem modest.
But Corsica has only 325,000 inhabitants and accounts for less than 0.5 percent of France's economy. One in five inhabitants lives under the poverty threshold.
Parliament speaker Talamoni, who wants independence at some point in the future and calls France “a neighbouring country”, says independence currently only has minority support and Corsica must first build up its economy and administrative infrastructure.
They struck a 10-year deal with nationalist politician Gilles Simeoni, who is also not a separatist, to seek more powers for Corsica but not independence.
This pact, together with the new-found peace and disillusion with mainstream parties, propelled them to victory in December, with Simeoni emerging to lead the regional government.
While they must convince Macron to delegate powers to their region, Simeoni and Talamoni must also ensure that activists who fought for such powers, often by blowing up buildings and attacking government officials, don't feel left out, said Jean-Paul Carrolaggi, a veteran separatist.
Simeoni said Macron must show next week that they are willing to heed some of their demands, warning that some return to violence on the island could not be excluded if Corsicans felt they were not being heard.
Uber has lost yet another executive to continue the exodus of departures at the transportation company, Automotive News reports. This time, it's Uber VP of Global Vehicle Programs Sherif Marakby, who helped launch Uber's self-driving program in Pittsburgh.
“Sherif's deep experience and knowledge of the automotive industry have helped us tremendously in working to make self-driving cars a reality,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.
It's not clear why Marakby left but Uber told Auto News that it was not related to the lawsuit with Waymo. It's also not clear if they left as a result of the sexual harassment allegations, but something tells me that scandal probably didn't make them particularly pumped to stick around. Marakby joined Uber last April after working at Ford for 25 years.
“Self-driving is one of the most interesting challenges I've worked on in my career, and I'm grateful to have contributed to what will soon be a safer future for everyone,” Marakby said in a statement.
In the past few months, a gazillion people have left Uber. Ok, a gazillion is a bit of an exaggeration, but Marakby's departure comes not too long after Uber lost its head of comms, president, head of AI Labs, VP of growth and SVP of engineering.

DANDONG, China (Reuters) - Chinese textile firms are increasingly using North Korean factories to take advantage of cheaper labour across the border, traders and businesses in the border city of Dandong told Reuters.
The clothes made in North Korea are labelled "Made in China" and exported across the world, they said.
Using North Korea to produce cheap clothes for sale around the globe shows that for every door that is closed by ever-tightening U.N. sanctions another one may open. The UN sanctions, introduced to punish North Korea for its missile and nuclear programs, do not include any bans on textile exports.
"We take orders from all over the world," said one Korean-Chinese business person in Dandong, the Chinese border city where the majority of North Korea trade passes through. Like many people Reuters interviewed for this story, they spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Dozens of clothing agents operate in Dandong, acting as go-betweens for Chinese clothing suppliers and buyers from the United States, Europe, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Russia, the business person said.
"We will ask the Chinese suppliers who work with us if they plan on being open with their client -- sometimes the final buyer won't realise their clothes are being made in North Korea. It's extremely sensitive," they said.
Textiles were North Korea's second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totalling $752 million, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA). Total exports from North Korea in 2016 rose 4.6 percent to $2.82 billion (2.17 billion pounds).
The latest U.N. sanctions, agreed earlier this month, have completely banned coal exports now.
Its flourishing textiles industry shows how impoverished North Korea has adapted, with a limited embrace of market reforms, to sanctions since 2006 when it first tested a nuclear device. The industry also shows the extent to which North Korea relies on China as an economic lifeline, even as U.S. President Donald Trump piles pressure on Beijing to do more to rein in its neighbour's weapons programmes.
Chinese exports to North Korea rose almost 30 percent to $1.67 billion in the first half of the year, largely driven by textile materials and other traditional labour-intensive goods not included on the United Nations embargo list, Chinese customs spokesperson Huang Songping told reporters.
Chinese suppliers send fabrics and other raw materials required for manufacturing clothing to North Korean factories across the border where garments are assembled and exported.
FACTORIES HUMMING
Australian sportswear brand Rip Curl publicly apologised last year when it was discovered that some of its ski gear, labelled "Made in China", had been made in one of North Korea's garment factories. Rip Curl blamed a rogue supplier for outsourcing to "an unauthorised subcontractor".
But traders and agents in Dandong say it's a widespread practice.
Manufacturers can save up to 75 percent by making their clothes in North Korea, said a Chinese trader who has lived in Pyongyang.
Some of the North Korean factories are located in Siniuju city just across the border from Dandong. Other factories are located outside Pyongyang. Finished clothing is often directly shipped from North Korea to Chinese ports before being sent onto the rest of the world, the Chinese traders and businesses said.
North Korea has about 15 large garment exporting enterprises, each operating several factories spread around the country, and dozens of medium sized companies, according to GPI Consultancy of the Netherlands, which helps foreign companies do business in North Korea.
All factories in North Korea are state-owned. And the textile ones appear to be humming, traders and agents say.
"We've been trying to get some of our clothes made in North Korea but the factories are fully booked at the moment," said a Korean-Chinese business person at a factory in Dalian, a Chinese port city two hours away from Dandong by train.
"North Korean workers can produce 30 percent more clothes each day than a Chinese worker," said the Korean-Chinese business person.
"In North Korea, factory workers can't just go to the toilet whenever they feel like, otherwise they think it slows down the whole assembly line."
"They aren't like Chinese factory workers who just work for the money. North Koreans have a different attitude -- they believe they are working for their country, for their leader."
And they are paid wages significantly below many other Asian countries. North Korean workers at the now shuttered Kaesong industrial zone just across the border from South Korea received wages ranging from a minimum of around $75 a month to an average of around $160, compared to average factory wages of $450-$750 a month in China. Kaesong was run jointly with South Korea and the wage structure - much higher than in the rest of North Korea - was negotiated with Seoul.
WORKERS IN CHINA
Chinese clothing manufacturers have been increasingly using North Korean textile factories even as they relocate their own factories offshore, including to Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia.
"Wages are too high in China now. It's no wonder so many orders are being sent to North Korea," said a Korean-Chinese business person who works in the textiles industry in Dandong.
Chinese textile companies are also employing thousands of cheaper North Korean workers in China.
North Korea relies on overseas workers to earn hard currency, especially since U.N. sanctions have choked off some other sources of export earnings. Much of their wages are remitted back to the state and help fund Pyongyang's ambitious nuclear and missile programmes, the U.N. says.
The new U.N. sanctions imposed on North Korea this month ban countries from increasing the current numbers of North Korean labourers working abroad.
China does not disclose official figures for the number of North Koreans working in factories and restaurants in China, although numbers are down from a peak period two to three years ago, according to Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea specialist at Beijing's Renmin University.
"It's a hassle to hire North Korean workers though," the Korean-Chinese business person from Dalian said. "You need to have the right set-up. Their living space has to be completely closed off, you have to provide a classroom where they can take classes every day. They bring their own doctor, nurse, cook and teachers who teach them North Korean ideology every day."
One clothing factory that Reuters visited in Dandong employs 40 North Korean workers. They fill smaller orders for clients who are more stringent about their supply chains and expressly request no production inside North Korea.
North Korean factory workers in China earn about 2,000 yuan ($300.25), about half of the average for Chinese workers, the factory owner said.
They are allowed to keep around a third of their wages, with the rest going to their North Korean government handlers, they said. A typical shift at the factory runs from 7:30 a.m. to around 10 p.m.
The workers - all women dressed in pink and black uniforms - sat close together behind four rows of sewing machines, working on a consignment of dark-coloured winter jackets.

Canucks Recall Anton Rodin
Last week, the Canucks recalled forward Anton Rodin from their three-game conditioning stint with the Utica Comets. Rodin was originally drafted in the second round (53rd overall) of the 2009 entry draft by the Canucks and has spent the past three seasons in the SHL. Rodin won the league MVP award last season (despite only playing 33 games due to injury), and made their NHL debut on December 23rd against the Calgary Flames (receiving seven minutes of ice time).

Analysis
Jacob Markstrom Deserves a Run as Starter
Coming into the 2015-16 season, Canucks general manager Jim Benning didn't hesitate to name 36-year-old Ryan Miller the team's starting netminder. While most expected a near 50/50 split between Miller and Swedish goaltender Jacob Markstrom, Benning was insistent that team was indeed going with Miller.
However, through 38 contests, neither has fully established themselves as distinctly superior to the other, leaving the path wide open for the 26-yearold to take advantage – and as of late, they have.
Over the course of their past three starts, Markstrom has played exceptionally well. They put up a startling .955 save percentage (on 44 shots) Saturday in a 3-2 shootout victory against the Edmonton Oilers, as well as stopping 33 of 36 in a 4-1 loss to the Calgary Flames (.917, in arguably the club's worst performance of the season). Previously, they had made 31 of 32 possible saves in a 4-1 win versus the Winnipeg Jets.
These are numbers more than worthy of consecutive starts, and while head coach Willie Desjardins seems hesitant to do so, it may just be time to let Markstrom take the reins, at least temporarily. Despite recent comments by Trevor Linden, the team's president, that Miller may return next year, that seems like a relatively unlikely possibility. The team needs to be ready to hand the starting position over to Markstrom in 2017-18, and now, while he's hot, is the time to ensure he's ready to handle it.
Luca Sbisa Playing Their Best Hockey as a Canuck
Since their arrival, no player has taken as much flack as Swiss defender Luca Sbisa. While most, if not all of it, has been warranted, the 26-year old seems to have come into their own recently and has proven to be a steady depth defenceman for the team.
The Canucks have presented an often-decimated defense core this season — with the likes of Alex Edler, Chris Tanev, and Erik Gudbranson all having missed time to injury — and Sbisa has been up to the task in helping replace them.
While the blunders are certainly still present, this season has been the most stable and confident he's looked since putting on a Canucks sweater (after their inclusion in the Ryan Kesler blockbuster). Their puck moving abilities appear to be on the upswing, which has decreased the number of eye-popping turnovers (or “pizzas” as they call them) off their stick this year.
He'll never set the world on fire, but they have begun rounding out their defensive game, while also starting to show a semblance of offensive capability — they rank second among Canucks defenceman with nine points. Will they ever be worth their insane $3.6 million per year contract? Probably not, but that's not their fault. The club needed them to step up, and they have certainly done that. Fans must give credit where it's due, and it's certainly due to Sbisa.

AOL is shutting down its instant messenger, AIM, after 20 years. The service will be taken offline on December 15th, the company has announced.
Michael Albers, communications products VP at Oath (the Verizon subsidiary that absorbed AOL), said in a statement: “AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed.”
Launched in 1997, AIM was one of the earliest and most popular instant messengers and served as a precursor to the Facebook Messengers and Twitters of today.
LONDON (Reuters) - Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, President Hassan Rouhani told the body's head on Wednesday, as they blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for the “new situation.”

“Iran's nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, but it is Iran that would decide on its level of cooperation with the IAEA,” Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying after meeting International Atomic Energy Agency head Yukiya Amano
“The responsibility for the change of Iran's cooperation level with the IAEA falls on those who have created this new situation,” they added.
Rouhani said if Iran does not continue to benefit from the nuclear deal after the U.S. withdrawal, it will make “new decisions”.
NEW YORK CITY - Bangladesh said on Wednesday the arrest of one of its diplomats in New York on charges of labor trafficking and assault appeared to be a violation of an international treaty on the treatment of diplomats.
Mohammad Shahedul Islam, the deputy consul general of Bangladesh Consulate General in New York was indicted on Monday on charges of labor trafficking and assault for forcing their domestic helper to work without pay through threats and intimidation.
“We have reasons to believe that the arrest is a clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963. We have lodged a strong protest with the chargé d'affaires of the United States Embassy in Dhaka,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
The ministry on Tuesday summoned a US diplomat to express its dismay over the arrest.
Islam has limited diplomatic immunity and was ordered to surrender their passport when they appeared in court in New York, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown in a statement on Monday.
According to the indictment, Islam brought another Bangladeshi, Ruhul Amin, to New York between 2012 and 2013 to work as household help.
Soon after Amin arrived, Islam allegedly took their passport and made them work 18 hours a day, allegedly without pay, according to the indictment.
“If the victim disobeyed the defendant's orders, Mr Amin was allegedly physically assaulted,” it said.
A spokesperson for the Bangladesh embassy in Washington said it believed Amin had filed the case in bad faith and the allegations were “fabricated” and “baseless”. Bail was set at $50,000 bond or $25,000 cash.
Shameem Ahsan, the Bangladeshi consul general in New York, told Reuters on Wednesday from New York that Islam has been released from a correctional center. Islam was not immediately available for comment.
The Bangladeshi embassy in Washington was in contact with the State Department about the prompt resolution of the case, the foreign ministry said. “We hope our concerns will be duly addressed,” it said.
AUGUST 14, 2017 — Shanghai, China, based Wison Offshore & Marine Ltd. reports that it has received Approval in Principle (AIP) from classification society Bureau Veritas for a newly-developed large-scale Floating LNG Storage and Regasification Terminal.
Featuring scalable storage capacity up to equivalent size of a Q-Max tanker, this is the first large-scale FSRU barge to be granted AIP by a classification society. It also underscores that Wison is now capable of providing a comprehensive range of FSRU solutions catering LNG import markets with various scales of demand.
Wison's full-size floating LNG terminal solution offers an economical alternative to the conventional LNG regasification vessels (LNG RV) especially for markets with long-term demand.
The barge design lowers initial capital investments (up to 20 percent compared with LNG RV of equivalent size) as well as O&M costs, while enabling uninterrupted service throughout project lifecycle.
"Wison large-scale FSRU is a fit-for-purpose facility designed with practical operation considerations," said Mr. David W. Chen, Senior Solution Manager at Wison Offshore & Marine. "It features scalable storage capacity from 150,000 cu.m to 265,000 cu.m and a base case design of 750 mmscfd regasification capacity expandable to fit project needs. Designed for near-shore/at-shore application, the FSRU can also be deployed offshore with a single point mooring system."
A month ago, BV granted AIP for Wison's 50 MW floating LNG power supply barge (50 MW W-FSRP). When commenting on the FSRU AIP, Jiahui Wu, Technical Manager of BV China, said, "Based on the excellent cooperation on the 25k Exmar FSRU project currently under execution at Wison shipyard, BV is very pleased to support Wison to further develop this large-scale FSRU design targeting a wider range of international clients. We are glad to work with Wison in bringing innovative solutions enabling more countries to access LNG as a clean and affordable energy."
Stockholm (ABC Live): WFP Strategic Partnership Agreement : The Swedish Government and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) today signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement, with Sweden making a historic commitment of approximately US$370 million in flexible funds to WFP over the next four years (2018 to 2021). The contribution is the largest ever made by a donor within a WFP Strategic Partnership Agreement.
“Sweden's extremely generous contribution provides WFP with one of the largest amounts of flexible and predictable funding any country has ever given us, enabling us to save lives at any given place and at any given time,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley. “The people and the government of Sweden help us bring hope to millions of people, including the most vulnerable people caught up in some of the world's most heart-breaking crises. When it comes to saving lives and changing lives, Sweden is a global leader.”
The Swedish contribution comes at a moment of unprecedented needs. The world is facing the worst humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II, with multiple large-scale hunger emergencies occurring across the planet. For the first time in a decade, the number of hungry people in the world is increasing. Today, the majority of world's hungry people live in countries affected by conflict, with ten of the thirteen largest food crises driven mainly by conflict.
“Sweden is a longstanding donor to WFP, as we see food assistance is one of the most critical ways to respond to famine and save lives in acute emergency situations,” said Minister for International Development Cooperation and Climate and Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lövin. “As part of our partnership, we are working closely with WFP to develop sustainable approaches to save livelihoods by promoting new methodology and policy.”
For nearly a decade, Sweden has been the largest donor of flexible – or unearmarked – funds to WFP. Sweden's leadership in providing flexible funding stands out at a time when more than 90 percent of government contributions to WFP are earmarked for specific operations or activities. In addition to its consistent funding, Sweden stands as one of WFP's strongest advocates for reduced earmarking among donors. Under the agreement known as the Grand Bargain, concluded at the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, Sweden and other leading donors committed to progressively reduce earmarking, with an aim of achieving a global target of 30 percent of humanitarian funding that is unearmarked or softly earmarked by 2020.
“The Swedish Government is a humanitarian champion and leading on the global level to increase flexible humanitarian funding for the most pressing needs. Flexible funding is crucial to kick-start operations and fund neglected crises, which has been the case in many situations like Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Rohingya crisis,” said Minister.

Cementing its reputation as a slow-motion corporate car-crash, made-up technology specialist Magic Leap has been sued for sex discrimination by the woman it hired to tackle sex discrimination.
Tannen Campbell filed in a Florida court [PDF] this week accusing the startup of maintaining a "hostile environment" and a "macho bullying atmosphere." They claimed they were fired after they challenged CEO Rony Abovitz on the "depths of misogyny in Magic Leap's culture."
As VP of strategic marketing and brand identity, Campbell says part of their job was to help the company with what it called its "pink/blue problem" (quick hint: not calling gender inequality a "pink/blue problem" is probably a good first step).
The pinkness was also literally an issue: the all-male tech team (who were matched by the all-male advertising and executive teams) were asked to consider how to make their augmented reality headset more female friendly and, according to Campbell, the only solution they arrived at was to produce a version in pink.
The lawsuit then offers a wide range of accusations of sexism, stemming from tetchy to highly personal to jaw-dropping. For starters, they took issue with the fact that the Florida company's jobs page was titled "Wizards wanted," seemingly shutting out women.
They then goes on to slam the CFO for being "the kind of man who sits a little too close to women," and the VP of IT for being loud and making "misogynistic comments." They even turn on the company's most senior woman, its chief business officer, accusing them of being "the perfect Magic Leap female employee: they went to Harvard, never disagrees with Abovitz and always does Abovitz's bidding."
Presentation
Before you start writing off Campbell, however, they go into some depth on the practices and approaches they recommended Magic Leap adopt in order to bring about a more balanced workplace, and they are good. Although some are perhaps more of a wish list – such as paying for a recruiter to help the partners of female hires relocated to Florida to find jobs as well to help ease the move to the company, and paying for female tech leaders including Sheryl Sandberg and Meg Whitman to attend company meetings as speakers.
They developed a presentation for CEO Abovitz but their scheduled meeting to go over it was cancelled no fewer than six times. It took them eight months to get the meeting, and then they terminated the meeting about halfway through. Efforts to reschedule meetings were repeatedly rebuffed.
Again, frustrating for sure, and the sign of a poor CEO, but not evidence of sex discrimination.
Campbell also highlights how suggestions for revising the headset to make it more comfortable for women (moving a connection away from the back of the head, using a more flexible cable, moving away from a belt pack) were roundly ignored.
But then they start to depict the casual sexism that many women will recognize in a work environment – especially in tech bro companies:
A picture of a male and female doctor was met with the comment that it looked like "bring your wife to work day."
One of the system's main games – Dr G – has only a single female character who, amazingly, is well-endowed and seemingly spends much of their time on their knees.
An email about a Google group set up for the spouses of Magic Leap employees was titled "Board (sic) Wives at home while you are loving it at the Leap" and was described as providing them with "someone local to hang out with when their significant other is slaving away at work thru-out the 12-hr day. Or are they just nagging you because you moved here?"
A senior staffer told a group of new hires when asked a question by one of the two women in the room that "women always have trouble with computers." They then advised everyone to "stay away from the three Os: Orientals, Old People and Ovaries."
On a conference call with an advertising agency, the CFO reportedly said: "I'm sitting here between two beautiful ladies. They're not going to want to put a big ugly device over their pretty faces. And I have an office with glass doors, I don't want people to see me with these beautiful girls with ugly things on their faces."
Campbell was told they were being "emotional" and "sensitive" when they opposed the addition of an outside agency head to an advertising team.
And so on, and so on.
Campbell argues that the failure to include more women or make them feel like valued members of the team is having a detrimental impact on the company and pokes at the company's Achilles Heel – the fact that it has still failed to produce a working prototype of the product it claims to have invented, and that it has purposefully misled people into believing that games and interfaces exist on its system, when in fact they were created by a special effects studio.
The lawsuit claims the issue "affects the company's core culture and renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars."
Fakey McFake Fake
As for the faked videos, Campbell claims they "raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do," but claims they were "ignored in favor of their male colleagues' assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were 'aspirational'."
Of course the answer to all of Magic Leap's problems lies with its CEO and the culture they have built around himself. As increasing numbers of tech journalists have discovered while trying to pin Rony Abovitz down on what their company has actually produced, they alternate wildly between praise and aggression and refuses to hear anything that sounds like criticism.
The lawsuit notes: "During Campbell's last four months at Magic Leap, Abovitz – who always had been pouty and prone to temper-tantrums – began to dig their heels in even more in the face of dissenting ideas and to explode ever more frequently into child-like fits of rage, threatening retribution when they didn't get their way, felt betrayed or was portrayed publicly in an unfavorable light."
Which again leads us to the question: where's the headset, Rony? Because the one that everyone has seen – that you claim is only a test rig – is an absolute shambles.
A spokesperson for Magic Leap was not available for immediate comment. ®

It did not take long for this year's Stanley Cup Final to generate drama beyond the confines of the ice. In Game 1 between the Washington Capitals and the Vegas Golden Knights, a bone-crushing blindside hit was delivered that spawned conversations across the NHL. Golden Knights forward Jonathan Marchessault was the recipient of the hit delivered by Tom Wilson of the Capitals.
The Hit by Wilson
The hit happened shortly after Wilson scored the tying goal at the 1:10 mark of the third period. It was a bizarre goal as the puck took a detour by way of Marc-Andre Fleury's skate. It put the Capitals up 4-3 and constituted the fourth lead change of the contest.
Approximately four minutes later, Wilson decided it was time to wreak a little havoc. They laser-focused on Marchessault and plastered them shoulder to shoulder after Marchessault no longer had the puck. They went down immediately and was eventually led to the dressing room. Wilson received a minor penalty for interference.
Fortunately, Marchessault was able to return to the ice and suffered no visible injuries from the blindside blast. Marchessault had to go through the NHL's concussion protocol, including a few minutes in the “quiet room”. The whole incident gives rise to the question, “What should the league's protocol be on these types of blindside hits?”
Has the issue of late, blindside hits spent too much time in the quiet room?
Argument One: “It Was a Legal Hit”
Among the plethora of hockey minds and fans that have talked about the hit since Game 1, there is a contingent of mostly “old school” fans who argue that the hit was legal and are wondering what all the fuss is about. Technically speaking, it was a legal hit, shoulder to shoulder. They did not aim for their head or spear them or do anything that looked like they were trying to break the existing rules of the game.
Sports talk phone lines were lit up by callers defending the hit as legal. Part of the rationale was that they did not hit them in the head or “Back in the day, that type of hit was routine in the NHL.” A good example of “back in the day” is the famous Philadelphia Flyers teams known as the Broad Street Bullies. The Bullies consisted of Bobby Clarke, their coach Fred ‘The Fog' Shero and tough guys Dave ‘The Hammer' Schultz, Andre ‘Moose' Dupont, Don Saleski and Bob ‘Hound Dog' Kelly.
Interestingly the Bullies won two Stanley Cups in 1973-74 and 1974-75. In November 2014, Adam Proteau wrote about the Bullies in The Hockey News, stating that the Flyers' first Cup win was against the heralded Boston Bruins with the incomparable Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito.
Proteau recounted this story from Bob Kelly: “Fred [coach Shero] came in to tell us the game plan and they said, ‘I think the game plan is going to be we're going to give Orr the puck.' We said, ‘Why the hell would you give Bobby Orr the puck? That's the last thing you want to do.' But it worked out. They just said, ‘I want you to work him, pressure him. By no means spear them or hurt him, but just bump him, make them skate around you, tire them out. As the series wears on, it's going to be tough on him.' And Freddy was right.”
This is a key point about the Bullies. They had a well-deserved reputation for fighting and playing tough. Michael Langlois recalls Game 6 of the 1974 Stanley Cup Final: “I think Clarke goaded Orr into more of a ‘fight' than Orr should have been getting into late in the game. To see these hockey warriors fighting – for the puck, for ice and then each other – was something to see. As valuable as Clarke was, getting Orr off the ice late in the game was a trade-off you'd take every time.”
But, there was an undeniable respect for Orr. The Bullies made no apology for their bare-knuckles brand of the game. But, even a group of “tough guys” had enough respect for a legend like Orr not hurt them with dirty hits. They don't often get the credit for being excellent hockey players — that fact is shrouded in the legend of their brawling, enforcing nature.
There are still fans who miss the Scott Stevens style of hockey, some even missing the fighting at the drop of a hat style of the Bullies. But, the NHL has moved beyond that part of the game, and what is left are some grey areas, like blindside hits that don't aim for the head. Hits like the one Wilson laid on Marchessault. Will the league take a look at this type of play in the offseason or, as Kerry Fraser Tweeted, have they already looked at it? If so, why no discipline for Wilson?

The League May Be Blind(sided)
The NHL seems to agree with those old school fans on this issue. The league has taken up many issues regarding player safety, even if some might argue that they lag leagues like the NFL in its concerns about concussions and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). One can say however that they are not “champing at the bit' to deal with the issue.
For example, in a lengthy but thorough examination of the CTE issue and the NHL, Adam Kilgore wrote last week in the Washington Post a column that included this quote that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman gave to reporters in March, after an NFL official acknowledged the link between football and CTE:
It's fairly clear that playing hockey isn't the same as football. And as we've said all along, we're not going to get into a public debate on this.
But, with hits like Wilson's occurring on the league's biggest stage – the Stanley Cup Final – a public debate may be unavoidable in spite of Bettman's desire to keep it out of the public square.
According to USA Today, Marchessault had this to say about Wilson's hit:
I saw the hit. I remember everything. It's a late hit. I think the league's going to take care of it. We know what type of player they are out there. You've got to keep your head up when he's there.
Many people on the morning sports talk shows and on social media felt confident that Marchessault was right, expecting the league to announce discipline for Wilson.
By mid-day on Tuesday, however, the NHL's Department of Player safety ruled in an unexpected manner:
“The Department of Player Safety told ESPN that there were a few factors that kept the Wilson hit from rising to the level of suspension. First, the hit was shoulder to shoulder rather than a hit to the head. The hit also was within the flow of the game, rather than the kind of retaliatory hits that have warranted suspensions in the past — such as the four-game ban earned by Bobby Farnham of the Devils for a hit on St. Louis Blues forward Dmitrij Jaskin in January 2016. The NHL didn't dispute that the hit was late but determined it wasn't as egregiously late as other interference plays that rose to the level of suspension.”
Wilson Pot, Meet Kettle
And just like that, the NHL gave the green light to players like Wilson to blast away at the unsuspecting, the unprepared, and the unaware. A solid check to the body is designed to separate a player from the puck. In this play, Marchessault had been rid of the puck for a couple of seconds so Wilson's hit was not meant to separate them from the puck. As previously mentioned, the NHL has addressed the issue of blindside hits, but may it seems that they may need some encouragement to stay true to its own rules.
The 5 + game misconduct for Interference was instituted for the very type of late blindside hit Tom Wilson just delivered. — Kerry Fraser (@kfraserthecall) May 29, 2018
Ironically, The Hockey Writers' Sammi Silber pointed out in their May 17 article, Capitals' Wilson Displeased with Stralman Hit, that Wilson was not happy to be on the receiving end of a blindsided hit delivered by Anton Stralman of the Tampa Bay Lightning: “It's a vulnerable position, and you know, there's no doubt there's contact with my head,” Wilson said. “I'm not here to complain about anything. I'm just talking about it for the best of the game and for the best of player safety.”
Silber pointed out that Stralman seemed to shift at the last minute and direct the hit to Wilson's shoulder. Nevertheless, Wilson was not happy. The player who has a deserved reputation for dishing out similar hits — as evidenced in their Game 1 blast of Marchessault — didn't like being hit himself. Imagine that.
The league is now in a situation where it will likely have to address these types of hits. Not because it wants to, as Bettman articulated, but because the CTE issue is not going to go away. In their Washington Post piece, Kilgore notes:
“More than 100 retired players have brought a class-action lawsuit against the NHL over brain injuries suffered while playing…Those in the suit seek medical care and a monitoring regime for the roughly 4,300 living retired players. They claim they entered into the league with a clear understanding of the harm the game could cause their bodies but not of the life-changing effects of brain trauma they suffered. They allege NHL teams provided inadequate oversight and care to treat brain injuries, all while the league promoted the game's violence, including bare-knuckle bouts on the ice.”
No, commissioner, this is not going to go away, even though Marchessault was not hit in the head directly. But, they were blasted without any opportunity to defend himself, and they could have sustained a concussion from such a hit. The NHL may pretend to be blind to the blindsiding issue – cloaking the matter in technical jargon that speaks to whether or not a player's head was hit – but it will not be able to keep up that pretence for much longer.
As with the legacy of Stevens, some will end up calling Wilson a dirty player while others will call them tough. Silber quoted Wilson again: “When someone gets run from behind, the next couple shifts you're going to be more tentative. There's going to be heavy hits in games. We need to control our emotions and make sure we're the better team for the majority of the 60.” The irony is so thick you can cut it with a knife.
PanARMENIAN.Net - The next generation of humans may well be genetically modified. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, February 14 issued a 216-page report endorsing human germline modification in the future, but only in certain cases that would otherwise result in children being born with serious genetic diseases, Engadget said.
Germline engineering refers to modifying a person or embryo's genetic code in such a way that the changes are passed onto their offspring. This differs from the more-accepted "somatic cell" method, better known as gene therapy, wherein the changes only affect the person being treated.
"Heritable germline genome editing trials must be approached with caution, but caution does not mean that they must be prohibited," the report read. A 22-member panel made up of prominent scientists and researchers spent a year compiling it. And while the panel is in favor of pursuing the technology, they warned that it must be done with "stringent oversight" and only as a corrective measure "preventing a serious disease or condition" -- not as a means of enhancing people with, say, super-strength, better looks or heightened intelligence.
The panel also stated that, in addition to preventing genetic diseases, gene editing to make people less susceptible to diseases like HIV, cancer or Alzheimer's would be acceptable. "We do not view prevention as a form of enhancement," the panel's co-chair, R. Alta Charo of the University of Wisconsin, told MIT Technology Review. "But whether it's permissible is up to regulators."
This recommendation stands in stark contrast to current legal regulations in both Europe and the U.S.. Here in America, germline engineering has been outlawed since 2015 when Congress added a rider to the Health and Human Services appropriations bill which banned the FDA from considering any proposal employing such modifications. China, on the other hand, has no such qualms with the technology and has already begun experimenting with it.

A successful teenage model fell to their death in the nude after allegedly plunging off the balcony of a 20th floor apartment while at a party.
Dutch national Ivana Smit, 18, has been a well-known model in Malaysia for the past five years after they moved to the country with relatives when they were five-years-old.
They had reportedly been partying and had visited the 20th floor apartment of a man and their wife at 5am last Thursday.
But several hours later Ivana's dead body was found naked after they fell - landing on another balcony on the sixth floor of the block of apartments in the Jalan Dang Wangi district of the city.
Police said there were "no criminal elements" to the death but Ivana's devastated father along with their wife and son have now arrived in the country and contacted Interpol to demand an investigation
Ivana's grandfather Hendrik Smit, who has lived in Penang, Malaysia, for over two decades and raised Ivana as a child there, said today: "We cannot believe they fell from level 20 and the body was found at level 6.

"She was found there naked. Where are their shoes and underwear? We believe there is a criminal element in Ivana's death.
"Of course we don't believe the story from the police because they can't give us photographs or a report from the scene. Ivana's father has contacted the Dutch ambassador and Interpol."
Ivana's father Marcel Smit claims Ivana, who had worked in fashion shows for Chanel and other brands, sent their boyfriend a message and selfie at 7.25am before they were found dead around seven hours later last Thursday afternoon at around 2pm or 3 pm.
They told Dutch media: "At about 10am they would have fallen from the balcony at 20 floors high. How is that possible? It is strange that they were not found until 3pm.
"She is tall, 1.81 metres, but the barrier [on the balcony] is also 1.2 metres. Only when you bend over, do you fall off. They did not fall and did not jump either."

According to Ivana's family, alcohol and ecstasy were allegedly been found in their blood.
The model's uncle Fred Agenjo said: "Those are not drugs that you're going to sleep on.
"There are so many questions. Them clothes have been found, but their shoes and underwear are not.
"The police do not look at their mobile phone. The police do not want to say whether the drugs were taken when they were alive. We want a full investigation."

Ivana had first moved to Malaysia 13 years ago and lived with their grandfather Fredrik. They were the second runner-up in Malaysia Supermodel Search 2014 and a leading model in the country.
Dang Wangi police chief Assistant Commissioner Shaharuddin Abdullah said the case was "sudden death" and appealed for more information from witnesses.
They said: "Our investigations so far and the post-mortem report show no elements of foul play."

One of the films that came out of this year's SXSW Festival with a lot of buzz was writer-director Leigh Whannell's sci-fi thriller Upgrade. The movie follows Grey Trace (played by Logan Marshall-Green), a man whose life is turned upside down when their wife is murdered in front of their eyes during a mugging that also leaves them paralyzed. Soon after, he's approached by a billionaire inventor with an experimental cure that will “upgrade” their body. The cure – an Artificial Intelligence implant called STEM – gives Grey physical abilities beyond anything experienced and the ability to relentlessly claim vengeance against those who murdered their wife and left them for dead.
I caught the movie a few days ago and loved it. Whannell managed to make every dollar of their limited budget shine on screen and the film has a few brutal set pieces that don't shy away from the blood and guts. Trust me; Upgrade is absolutely worth your time and money when it hits theaters on June 1st.
A few days ago, I sat down with Logan Marshall-Green for a video interview. They talked about how they got involved in Upgrade, what it was about the script that appealed to him, the most challenging part of the performance, if the script changed a lot on set and a lot more. In addition, as a big fan of Quarry (it aired for one year on Cinemax), I asked if they ever heard what the second season would have been about and what they remember most from making the show.
Check out what Logan Marshall-Green had to say in the player above and below is exactly what we talked about.

“Because one essential feature of the contemporary art world is artificial scarcity,” Philip Kennicott writes. “Theoretically, the Hirshhorn could line its ringed galleries with four or five versions of each room. More people could see them, and more people could experience the effect for longer periods. Except that Kusama has defined their rooms as ‘unique art works,' and that ultimately diminishes their reach and impact.”

AUSTIN, Texas (AP)  Authorities have called on the person or people behind the bombings in Austin, Texas, to reach out to the police to let them know why theyre setting off the explosives.
Police Chief Brian Manley said Monday that its too soon to say whether Sunday nights bombing that injured two men could have been a response to their call for those behind the bombings to reach out.
Manley says investigators see similarities between Sunday nights bomb and three others this month that killed two people and injured two others. But they say Sundays differed in that it involved a tripwire whereas the others were package bombs left on peoples doorsteps.
Frederick Milanowski, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, says the latest bomb is more sophisticated because it used a tripwire.

EARLIER:
10:15 a.m.
Authorities say investigators see similarities between the latest bomb to detonate in Texas capital city and three bombs that went off earlier this month.
Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference Monday that although the bomb that injured two men Sunday night seems linked to the three previous ones, the latest bomb involved a tripwire and those three were package bombs left on peoples doorsteps.
Frederick Milanowski, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, says the latest bomb is more sophisticated because it used a tripwire.
Manley says the two victims are men ages 22 and 23 and that they are hospitalized in stable condition with significant injuries.
Both men are white, as opposed to the victims of the three prior bombings, who were black or Hispanic. Those attacks killed two people and injured two others.
9 a.m.
Austins mayor says growing anxieties are legitimate and real following the fourth bombing in the city this month.
Mayor Steve Adler told The Associated Press on Monday that residents shouldnt think twice about calling 911 if they see anything suspicious. A blast occurred Sunday night in a neighborhood far from the sites of the three package bombings in Austin this month.
Police havent confirmed the latest explosion, which injured two men who were riding or pushing bikes, is related to the first three, but theyre looking into the possibility.
Authorities say Sundays explosion was detonated by a tripwire and showed a different level of skill from previous blasts. Adler says the concern now is that the methodology has changed.
8:30 a.m.
Austins police chief says the two men injured in the most recent bombing in Austin were riding or pushing bicycles when the explosives detonated.
Police Chief Brian Manley told ABCs Good Morning America on Monday that Sunday nights explosion was detonated by a tripwire and showed a different level of skill. The attack differed from three earlier blasts in Austin this month, which were caused by package bombs left on peoples doorsteps.
The men injured in Sundays blast were white, unlike the victims of the first three bombings, who were black or Hispanic.
Authorities have cordoned off the neighborhood where the bomb went off Sunday night and have warned residents to remain indoors while officers check for anything suspicious.
8:20 a.m.
The University of Texas campus police force is warning students returning from spring break to be aware of the four recent bombings to hit Austin, saying, We must look out for one another.
In a tweet Monday, UT Austin police said, When you get on campus this morning ASK your friends if theyve heard about the bombings. TELL them about the incidents.
It also urged students to report suspicious items to the authorities. Classes were resuming Monday after a week off.
A blast triggered by a tripwire in a residential neighborhood Sunday night injured two men. Three previous package bombs detonated in different parts of the city since March 2, killing two people and injured two more.
None of those incidents were close to the universitys sprawling campus near the heart of Austin.
8 a.m.
Austins police chief says the latest bombing to hit the city was detonated by a tripwire, showing a different level of skill.
Police Chief Brian Manley told ABCs Good Morning America on Monday that both of the men injured in Sunday nights blast are white, unlike the victims in the citys three previous bombings this month, who were black or Hispanic.
Sunday nights explosion happened in the southwestern Austin residential neighborhood of Travis Country. The three previous bombings happened two-plus weeks in residential neighborhoods east of Interstate 35, which divides the city.
Authorities have warned Travis Country residents to remain indoors until 10 a.m. as police scour the area for anything suspicious.
7:25 a.m.
Police have warned residents near the site of the latest explosion in Austin to remain indoors and to call 911 if they need to leave home before 10 a.m.
Authorities say Sunday nights explosion in the Travis Country neighborhood in southwestern Austin injured two men and may have been triggered by a tripwire. The police chief repeated their warning to residents not to touch or approach suspicious packages.
Investigators are trying to determine whether the blast is related to three package bombings this month in other parts of the city that killed two people and injured two others.
Austins school district announced that buses wouldnt be going into the Travis Country neighborhood.
Authorities had already offered $115,000 in rewards for information leading to an arrest in the first three bombings.
INDIA: India successfully put a record 104 satellites from a single rocket into orbit on Wednesday in the latest triumph for its famously frugal space agency.
Scientists gathered for the launch in the southern spaceport of Sriharikota burst into applause as the head of India´s Space Research Organisation (ISRO) announced all the satellites had been ejected.
"My hearty congratulations to the ISRO team for this success," ISRO director Kiran Kumar told scientists who had gathered at the observatory to watch the progress of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi immediately congratulated the scientists for the successful launch which smashes a record previously held by Russia.
"This remarkable feat ... is yet another proud moment for our space scientific community and the nation. India salutes our scientists," Modi wrote on Twitter.
The rocket took off at 9:28am (0358 GMT) and cruised at a speed of 27,000 kilometres (16,777) per hour, ejecting all the 104 satellites into orbit in around 30 minutes, according to ISRO.
The rocket´s main cargo was a 714 kilogram satellite for earth observation but it was also loaded with 103 smaller "nano satellites", weighing a combined 664 kilograms.
Nearly all of the nano satellites are from other countries, including Israel, Kazakhstan, The Netherlands, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and 96 from the United States.
The launch means India now holds the record for launching the most satellites in one go, surpassing Russia which launched 39 satellites in a single mission in June 2014.
The business of putting commercial satellites into space for a fee is growing as phone, Internet and other companies, as well as countries, seek greater and more high-tech communications.
India is competing with other international players for a greater share of that launch market, and is known for its low-cost space programme.
Last June, India set a national record after it successfully launched a rocket carrying 20 satellites, including 13 from the US.
It sent an unmanned rocket to orbit Mars in 2013 at a cost of just $73 million, compared with NASA´s Maven Mars mission which had a $671 million price tag.
ISRO is also mulling the idea of missions to Jupiter and Venus.
Modi has often hailed India´s budget space technology, quipping in 2014 that a rocket that launched four foreign satellites into orbit had cost less to make than Hollywood film "Gravity".
As if the national humiliation we suffered at the hands of the tainted trio – Salman butt, Muhammad Amir and Muhammad Asif – was not enough, we now have fresh set of allegations against Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif of crooked dealings in PSL 2017.
Many saw it coming following Amir's comeback. It goes without saying that if proven guilty, the duo should be handed exemplary punishments without an iota of leniency for bringing a bad name to the country as well as the nation's favourite sport.
There is a slight glimmer of hope that back door diplomacy will not have its say and this time zero tolerance towards corruption will be transparently shown to all.
Many high-ranking and former cricket legends had warned of setting a bad example by allowing the convicted bowler to wear the green shirt again.
Heart-broken, but intuitive, fast bowler Shoaib Akhter tweeted:
Match-fixing allegations in PSL extremely gutting but honestly I saw it coming. If proven, it shud b non-negotiable. Guilty shud b punished. — Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) February 10, 2017
Since Shoaib, like all of us, was extremely upset, there came another tweet from him, stating:
Soul of my beloved game n my country's image should not be compromised in d razzmatazz of PSL. We've already lost so much ground. — Shoaib Akhtar (@shoaib100mph) February 10, 2017
I am sorry to add, but the soul of national esteem is also hurt. Isn't it?
Fuming and showing their pessimism towards the affairs in PCB, Sarfraz Nawaz said:
‘Such kinds of incidents cannot be avoided in Pakistan cricket because the PCB loves to keep tainted players around.'
You are so right Mr Nawaz.
The perplexing question is if strict punishment would really be enough to prevent such incidents in the future or do we need a comprehensive approach to address this disturbing trend in the sport.
While many are blaming the PCB for this pernicious incident, we must acknowledge that PCB had upright surveillance over the players and that is why the alleged have been caught very early on in the tournament.
I think the PCB also deserves credit for taking swift action of spotting corruption and sending the offenders back home, instead of sweeping the issue under the carpet to prevent reputational damage to PSL. We should not forget that in the past the board had episodes where it compromised discipline if the player is a performing one or someone with strong fanfare.
Issues relating to discipline and integrity have to be dealt with iron hand, without giving any consideration to performance, fanfare and political clout.
Cricket is a highly rewarding game so we should rule out the possibility of low incomes that may induce players to corruption. However, greed has no limits and that is why we see players indulging in corrupt practices despite having recognition, bright future and lucrative incomes.
The board needs to address this psyche and come forward with exemplary punishments if it is serious about getting rid of the mess.
The investigation is still underway and I pray that both players are absolved of all these charges and they come clean out of this, if they have not really done anything objectionable.

LOS GATOS >> You're going to have to dig a little bit deeper into your wallet to pay for the privilege of watching “Stranger Things,” “House of Cards” and everything else on Netflix.
That's because the internet-based TV company is raising the prices on two of its video-streaming options.
Netflix said Thursday that the price of its most popular plan will go from $9.99 a month to $10.99. That plan allows for simultaneous streaming and HD viewing on two internet-connected devices such as an iPad and a Roku set-top box. Another plan that lets viewers watch shows on up to four devices at a time, and includes 4K Ultra HD video, is going up by $2 a month, from $11.99 to $13.99.
Netflix said it will start sending out notifications by email to its subscribers beginning Oct. 19. Based on a customer's billing cycle, Netflix will give a subscriber 30 days to either accept the price increase, change to a lower-priced plan, or cancel service.
It will be the first time Netflix has implemented a price increase since October 2015.
There's no real secret behind the reasons for Netflix raising its prices. The company is banking much of its future on original programming, and has said it will spend $6 billion in this year alone to acquire and produce original and exclusive programs.
Michael Pachter, who covers Netflix for Wedbush Securities, noted that the price increase is only in the U.S. and estimates that the company will take in about $700 million in new revenue from the new pricing structure. Pachter based their estimates on the approximately 50 million Netflix subscribers in the U.S., along with revenue from new subscribers who sign up next year.
“I don't think most existing subscribers will even notice (the increase),” Pachter said. “Netflix has been really good about notifying subscribers of price hikes, so everyone will receive an email, but it's unlikely that many will care, even if they read it. I think that most subscribers consider the service a great value.”
Original programming has become a marquee area of focus for Netflix and its streaming rivals such as Hulu, and Amazon, with its Prime Video service. In September, Hulu stole some of Netflix's thunder when its show “The Handmaid's Tale” won the Emmy award for Best Drama series. It was the first time an internet-streaming program won the Best Drama Emmy Award.
With its price increase, Netflix will charge more on a per-month basis than similar plans offered by either Hulu or Amazon. Hulu's service starts at $10 a month, while Amazon's can be had for as low as $8.25 a month, based on its $99 annual membership fee. Netflix still offers a subscription plan for $7.99 a month, but that only allows for streaming on one connected device at a time and doesn't support HD streaming.

Netflix has also had a mixed history of price increases. Back in 2011, the company saw hundreds of thousands of customers drop its service after it said it would no longer include streaming and DVD rentals in a single subscription.
The last time Netflix increased prices, the company took the step of grandfathering in prior customers at their old rates for two years before they would see their subscription fees go up.
Pachter thinks Netflix's price increases would be more likely to dissuade potential new subscribers, and that Amazon and Hulu may draw those customers to their services instead.
“I expect both competitors to exploit the fact that they are cheaper, and expect households below median income to notice,” Pachter said. “I don't think we'll see an immediate impact (on Netflix subscriber numbers), but this could affect subscriber growth in the first or second quarters (next year) for Netflix.”
The price increase also comes 11 days before Netflix is scheduled to report its third-quarter results. The company has said it expects to add 4.4 million subscribers in the quarter, which would give it 108.4 million subscribers worldwide. Some Wall Street analysts say recent business trends suggest Netflix may even surpass that number when it reports its results.
Investors approved of Netflix's move to boost its revenue, and sent the company's shares up 5.4 percent, to close Thursday at $194.39.

A green sea turtle stabbed on Kauai should make a full recovery.
State officials said the turtle is gaining back strength.
The incident happened on Thursday near Nawiliwili.
Department of Land and Natural Resources officials said a 39-year-old Kauai man was seen using a knife and large rock to strike the turtle, and tried to pry open the shell.
A witness reported the incident to Kauai police who called DLNR Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement.
The male was cited for take of endangered species §13-124-11(1).
Prohibited activities. (a) With respect to endangered and threatened species of wildlife except as provided in subsection (c) or as permitted by the department, no person shall or attempt to: (1) Take, possess, process, sell, offer for sale, or transport any such species, any young or egg, or the dead body or skin thereof within the State.
The turtle was turned over to the DLNR Division of Aquatic Resources marine biologist for observation.
If the turtle continues to improve, DLNR will release it back to the ocean.

Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures have released a new poster for the upcoming Tomb Raider movie, and while it may be simple, it gets the point across: don't mess with Alicia Vikander's Lara Croft. The Oscar-winning Danish Girl actor leads the long-in-the-works video game adaptation as a 21-year-old bike courier in East London who refuses to follow in their father's entrepreneurial footsteps. Croft leaves behind their old life and goes in search of their father's last-known destination: a fabled tomb on a mythical island off the coast of Japan.
All the footage we've seen thus far from director Roar Uthaug's (The Wave) adaptation has been promising, showcasing a slightly grittier Indiana Jones vibe to the whole ordeal. Of course, we still have yet to see a great video game movie come our way and Angelina Jolie led two underwhelming Tomb Raider adaptations in the 2000s, but there's certainly reason to be optimistic about this one—especially with Walton Goggins playing the film's villain.
Check out the new Tomb Raider movie poster below. Scripted by Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel), the film also stars Dominic West, Walton Goggins, and Daniel Wu. Tomb Raider opens in theaters on March 16, 2018.

LONDON - Trevor Bayliss is becoming ever more annoyed by the kind of England batting collapses which led to their "embarrassing" nine-wicket defeat by Pakistan in the first Test at Lord's.
Bayliss, who became England coach before the start of the team's home 2015 Ashes success, has been known to encourage attacking batting as they have improved the team's fortunes in the limited-overs game.
But they insisted the Test top-order must be prepared to graft for their runs if conditions and the quality of the opposition attack require an initially more cautious approach. England were skittled out for just 184 in their first innings at Lord's by disciplined bowling from Pakistan, whose resolute batsmen then made 363 in reply.
Bayliss's side have lost six of their last eight Tests, ahead of the finale of a two-match series against Pakistan at Headingley starting on Friday. Asked if their words were getting through to the players, Bayliss replied: "Well, obviously not enough."
The Australian, rarely given to venting their frustration in public, added: "In a way, you almost throw your hands up sometimes. "But what else can you do? We continually deliver that type of message and are continually working on it in the nets."
Pakistan's batsmen displayed great care at Lord's and Bayliss insisted England's had been advised to play in similarly responsible fashion before home captain Joe Root won the toss and batted first. "It was the same as always on these type of wickets," Bayliss said. "It's going to be difficult early -- you've got to work hard early and earn the right to bat long, you've got to bat in partnerships."
"The mistakes we made - throwing hands at the ball...(not) letting the ball come -- under pressure, in the middle, we've got to do it better."
England, particularly at home, have shown an ability to bounce back rapidly from heavy defeat and Bayliss said: "They've been up for it in the past. I'd be expecting they'd be a little embarrassed about the way they played, and the performance in the next one will be better."
England, in a bid to win next year's World Cup on home soil, have radically altered their domestic fixture schedule in recent times. Much of the first-class County Championship programme is now played at the two ends of the season, rather than in the height of summer.
This, critics argue, means the odds are weighted too heavily in favour of medium-pacers who would be non-threatening on better pitches, with batsmen consequently less inclined to get their heads down than they would on more reliable surfaces.
"Is playing on (county) wickets where you're not going to bat for too long, before you get one that does a heap, is that necessarily good in the long term for learning how to concentrate for long periods?," asked Bayliss. "All we want for the players is the very best, for them to be playing at their very best, and winning games for England," they added.
England have dropped opener Mark Stoneman, who managed just 13 runs in total at Lord's, and recalled Keaton Jennings for Headingley as they try to avoid a third successive loss after reverses in Australia and New Zealand.
But their batting was not the only issue at Lord's, with England also dropping five catches during Pakistan's first innings. Bayliss did not hide their exasperation at England's poor fielding, saying: "I'm almost at a loss sometimes. It's got to be concentration, I think, and confidence.
"Once the first one goes down, it's a little bit like when we lose a wicket or two... sometimes that confidence goes down."

Los Angeles (Reuters) - The galaxy far, far away was brought to life in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday for the world premiere of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” where the anticipated first screening was dedicated to the franchise's late star, Carrie Fisher.
“I want to dedicate tonight to Carrie, who is up there right now flipping me the bird, saying ‘Damn it Rian, don't you dare make this night a solemn tribute,'” the film's writer-director Rian Johnson said as they introduced the screening.
“So let's all have a blast tonight for Carrie,” they said.
The film ends with a dedication to Fisher, who plays Princess Leia. The actor died at age 60 last December after completing their work on “The Last Jedi”.
Them character, now known as General Leia Organa, leader of the Resistance, plays a key role in the film.
Walt Disney Co.'s “The Last Jedi”, out in U.S. theaters on Dec. 15, follows 2015's “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and picks up with the Resistance fighting off Supreme Leader Snoke's First Order which is trying to take control of the galaxy.

Rey (Daisy Ridley), meanwhile, tries to convince Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to join the Resistance fight and bring a spark of hope to the rebels against Snoke's tyrannical rule.
The film explores themes of the battle to find a balance in the Force, the supernatural energy that runs through the fictional “Star Wars” galaxy. Reviews of the film are embargoed until Dec. 12.

The star-studded ensemble cast, including Ridley, John Boyega, Lupita Nyong‘o, Adam Driver, Andy Serkis and Hamill, walked the red carpet at the premiere, surrounded by droids and Stormtroopers.
Guests walked into the entrance of the premiere flanked by larger-than-life AT-AT Walker transport vehicles.
Johnson paid tribute to Fisher on the red carpet.
“Once the audience sees their performance in this movie, she's going to be there in all our hearts,” they said. “It's bizarre not having them here tonight. They would be the life of the party.”

But Mary Ann Cotton wasn't the only killer in town. Life in the 1800s England was no walk in the park and almost anything could be the cause of one's demise. Here are a few ways everyday life in the Victorian era could kill you.
Fashion
Fashion – particularly women's fashion – was not designed for comfort or practicality. Corsets would literally squeeze a woman's organs, rendering them dysfunctional. Massive flowing skirts proved to be hazardous as they were extremely flammable and managed to catch in dangerous places. Many fabrics used for both men and women's clothing were plagued by infectious parasites, breaking down their host's immune system. Men regularly sported high and tight collars, fashionable during special occasions and get-togethers, only to be strangled by them in a drunken stupor. You could say Victorian fashionistas were “dressed to kill.”
Green wallpaper
Scheele's Green was a particularly sought-after yellowish-green that was used in lavish housing, including some rooms of Buckingham Palace. The shade was not only popular in wallpaper but also as food coloring, dye for children's toys, candles, and more. But it was also laced with Cotton's favorite poison: Arsenic. People would breathe in flakes of wallpaper, and warm temperatures would release arsenic from the walls.
Aluminum bread
Commercially-produced bread posed a fatal threat to small children. Alum powder was used to make bread appear whiter and fresher, but its toxic qualities caused children to suffer extreme malnutrition and bowel issues, often leading to death. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act of 1875 banned its use.
Gas lighting
In Victorian England nearly all streetlamps were gas-lit and many homes soon acquired indoor gas lighting fixtures. Gas explosions were a constant threat, and gas leaks could silently suffocate people who had no significant ventilation outlets.
Food poisoning
Food poisoning today isn't fun, but it's hardly fatal. In the 1800s a small case of food poisoning could cost one their life. Strychnine, sulphates, and lead diluted foods triggering a breakdown of the central nervous system and ultimately leading to death by asphyxia.
Staircases
Victorian homes were tall but cramped, and staircases were dangerously steep and narrow. With heavy skirts, stiff pants, heeled shoes, and polished floors that fashion dictated, disaster was bound to strike. If one were to take an unfortunate spill, they'd likely tumble a long distance, causing severe trauma to their head and limbs and internal bleeding. Servants who weren't careful could easily trip while carrying heavy objects.
Toilets
Exploding toilets were relatively common during the era. A buildup of toxic gasses like methane and hydrogen sulphide from human waste could make its way into the home and be ignited by any open flame – particularly dangerous in an era of candles and gas lamps. Impact from the explosion or flying shards of material could be one's unlikely killer.
Mary Ann Cotton potentially got away with more than we know, but they aren't the only threat to someone's life in those days.

How to get away with murder in Victorian England
(DAN FENNER - For The Oakland Press) Novi's Traveon Maddox hit the game-winning shot in last Wednesday's Class A regional victory over Ann Arbor Skyline.
The mantra for the Novi Wildcats on the hardwood this year is, Leave no doubt.
As we enter the final week of the 2018 state boys basketball tournament, little, if any, has been left.
Just three months ago, that wasnt the case. There were doubts simmering around the holidays. But those doubts were squashed pretty quickly. All that remains is prowess and potential greatness. Opening the campaign 1-5, the Wildcats have only lost twice since Christmas Break and are obviously peaking at the right time.
A veteran, highly-skilled group of playmakers are fueling Novis run into the Class A quarterfinals. Wily and battle-tested, the Wildcats enter Tuesdays elite eight matchup versus Belleville Tuesday at Calihan Hall with supreme focus and determination.

Weve learned so much these last few years about how to win in March, head coach Brandon Sinawi said. These guys are locked in right now. Everythings clicking, everythings fitting into place.
The core of Sinawis squad has won three straight district titles and persevered through last years controversial, gut-wrenching defeat at the buzzer in the regional finals to West Bloomfield. The experience factor is paying dividends.
This is a special group, they wanted to really make a mark on this program and thats what theyve done, Sinawi said. They push each other. They challenge each other. They bring out the best in each other. Their drive and knowledge of the game are setting them apart from the pack.
Before last week, Novi (17-7) had never nabbed a regional crown.
Were not settling, said Sinawi looking ahead. Were not just happy to be here, to have a seat at this table. We want more and thats the attitude we plan on taking this week.
The Wildcats roll out heavy doses of firepower that can go toe-to-toe depth wise with any club in the state.
Swingman Traveon Maddox is signed with Oakland University. The 6-foot-5 Maddox hit the game-winner on a one-handed bank shot in the lane to send Novi to a 61-59 win over previously-unbeaten Ann Arbor Skyline in last Wednesdays regional championship game. They turned down multiple Division I football offers to play hoops at the next level. Their pull-up jumper is nearly unstoppable.
Senior point guard Trendon Hankerson and junior shooting guard Jiovanni Miles are as equally explosive on the perimeter as Maddox is. Both are Division I college prospects. Hankerson missed the first six weeks of the season and finally back at full strength, directing traffic at the controls of the Wildcats offense. Transfer Tariq Woody, a 6-foot-9 center who relocated from Plymouth, is patrolling the paint with tenacity. Woodys buzzer-beating put-back edged Novi past Canton 60-58 in the district semifinals.
On the verge of history
If Clarkston repeats as Class A state boys basketball champions this week, Wolves all-state floor general and Michigan State-signee Foster Loyer has a very good chance at becoming the schools all-time leading scorer. Loyer is 65 points behind former Clarkston McDonalds All-American Dane Fife, currently an assistant coach at Michigan State.
Fife tickled the twine for 2,287 points between 1995 and 1998, before going on to play in college at Indiana. Coming into the quarterfinals (Clarkton takes on Flint Carman-Ainsworth Tuesday at Grand Blanc), Loyer, averaging 27 points a night, has 2,222.

SHEFFIELD UNITED midfielder Lee Evans insists that they have no axe to grind ahead of their first return to a place they know well in Molineux this evening.
Evans is one of three Blades players who return to their old stomping ground, with defender Richard Stearman and striker Leon Clarke also facing their former club in a fixture of significance towards the top end of the Championship.
The Blades' pressing need to keep their play-off quest on track means that sentiment will be secondary for the visiting trio and while Evans is looking forward to catching up with a few old faces at Molineux, their overwhelming concern is football business.
Evans is the first to admit that they felt their future had been away from Molineux for some time, with their £750,000 move to United arriving after they were recalled from a loan spell at Wigan Athletic at the start of the new year.
All told, the Welshman, who joined Wolves from Newport in January 2013, played 67 times for Wanderers – including 26 appearances in the League One title-winning side of 2013-14 – but never truly established themselves in the all-gold jersey under several managers
Evans, who trained, along with several other senior Wolves' senior players, with the Under-23s in the close season before heading to Wigan, said: “I think I had a fair crack. I am not going to sit here and blame other people for my time at Wolves. I was in and out a bit, but there is no axe to grind. I am just looking forward to the game. It should be a great one.
“I was in and out of the team for my four or five years there. My best spell was probably the League One winning season and then the start of the Championship season after that.
“Different managers come in with different ideas and, to be fair, I knew my time there was coming to an end.
“Different managers gave me new contracts when I was there. There were managers who played me more than others, but that is football. It was just time to move on.
“It was a case of finding the right club for me and I am delighted to have done that. I just knew it when I came here.
“I had great memories there and made some good friends. But I wanted to find the next step somewhere.”
They added: “There's me, Richard Stearman and Leon Clarke all going back to a ground where we have played and had success. I am really looking forward to it.
“There are a lot of people behind the scenes that helped me a lot for however many years I was there but, to be honest, my only focus is doing a job for Sheffield United.
“I am not too fussed about anything else. Fans will have their opinions about me and they are entitled to have those. Hopefully, if I get the nod I can do a good job for us.”
Early evidence suggests the Blades have made an astute signing in Evans, who is displaying the poise that was also pronounced during an exemplary loan spell at Bradford in 2015-16.
They may have been at their new club for less than a month, but the 24-year-old believes they have already seen enough quality to suggest that the Blades can last the Championship course and extend their season into late May.
Despite a late defeat to Aston Villa in midweek, that feeling was fortified following a vibrant United performance against one of the divisional big-hitters which fully deserved more.
The Blades also flexed their muscles against Wolves in administering a 2-0 home win in the autumn and are chasing a first double over Wanderers since the promotion season of 1989-90.
Evans added: “With the quality of the players here, we have got a really good squad. There is no better year than this to have a real good crack at it. There are boys not even getting on the bench here who would easily play for other clubs. The strength in depth is there.
“The gaffer stresses that to us numerous times. Others can spend what they like but, at the end of the day, it is eleven versus eleven.
“If you look at their (Wolves) starting line-up on the night, they will have spent however many millions. But we know, with our team and our system, we can cause any team a problem. It is down to us to turn up.
“As the manager alludes to, they shop in a different market to a lot of the others. The Aston Villa team had Premier League names in it.
“But here, we take a different route. The manager here will look at players who have done well in League One as well and give them an opportunity.
“Then it is up to us to prove they were right to do that.”
Authorities in Kazakhstan say that at least nine people were killed when a residential building in the central town of Shakhan, about 200 kilometers southeast of the capital, Astana, partially collapsed.
The Interior Ministry reported that the building collapsed on January 2, but the cause of the disaster has not been determined.
Rescue workers continue to work at the scene, and authorities said the death toll could still rise.
Four survivors, including two children, have been pulled from the ruins.

A Mid-Michigan girl battling a rare but aggressive bone cancer has found confidence in cosmetics.
Now she's out to help other young cancer victims feel good about themselves as well. But they need your help.
TV5 introduced you to McKenna Schummer in June 2016 when the Grand Blanc community began raising money for their medical bills.
Now McKenna has the opportunity to create a beauty bar at the Children's Hospital of Detroit.
"Makes it more entertaining, more fun, less boring. Something for me to do while I'm there," McKenna said.
They have been in and out of the hospital since they were first diagnosed a year and a half ago. They turned to make up to feel better.
"Just more confident in myself that I can do more things and go out in public more," McKenna said.
The beauty bar will allow other young girls battling cancer to join their passion for makeup.
"We wanted to link their passion of makeup to McKenna. Put it together and one day McKenna was like, 'that's it. McKenna's Squad Beauty Bar,'" said Melissa Schummer, McKenna's mom.
Melissa said it will be a team effort to get the beauty bar up and running.
"We are collecting any type of makeup for girls, as well as anything for boys, gift cards, monetary donations," Melissa said.
To help them toward their goal, Identity Salon - located at 5454 E. Grand Blanc Road, in Grand Blanc - hosted a fundraiser on Feb. 2.
The business will accept donations, makeup, and gift cards to help McKenna stock up their beauty bar.
You can also drop off donations at Grand Blanc schools or straight to the Detroit Children's Hospital.
Meanwhile, McKenna has some words of encouragement for kids who may be facing the same struggles as them
"Stay strong and you eventually get through it. And hopefully this will help them get through it," they said.

Spoilers ahead if you aren't caught up with The Walking Dead.
Longtime fans of both Collider and AMC's The Walking Dead may have noticed that the former's coverage of the latter has been lessening over the last couple of years. It was never planned to be that way, it just kind of happened. Reviewers, recappers, and readers, myself included, simply lost interest in the weekly bludgeoning of drudgery that the series has become over the years. A good number of fans are sticking with it, even if it looks like the ratings are on their way back down from a series high, but the show itself seems more willing than ever to double-down on just how much they despise the fanbase.
Perhaps the best example of this strange phenomenon–other than the fiasco of stringing out the reveal of the first major character death at the hands of Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) between Seasons 6 and 7; the Season 6 finale is the second-lowest rated episode and the second-most voted on over at IMDb–is the show's most recent episode, the Season 8 midseason finale, “How It's Gotta Be.” The overlong episode, most of which meandered back and forth between various areas, times, and shades of pitch-black darkness, resulted in the likely doom of one of The Walking Dead‘s original and most beloved characters. Spoilers ahead.
By episode's end, it was revealed that Carl–who has already been shot, twice–had been bitten by a Walker. (I mean, we're assuming it was a Walker. It could have been some weirdo Savior or one of the Trash People because who even knows what this show is up to anymore.) Now, if things were to play out the way they do for everyone else, Carl should bite it sooner than later; he'll have to die, turn, and be put down. Chandler Riggs is likely going to appear in at least one more episode, but if their dad's Facebook reaction and showrunner Scott Gimple‘s quotes are to be believed, this is the end of the road for Young Master Grimes.
In a Facebook post that's been deleted/blocked, the elder Riggs (a proxy for the elder Grimes) said the following (via THR):
“Watching Gimple fire my son 2 weeks before their 18th birthday after telling them they wanted them for the next 3 years was disappointing. I never trusted Gimple or AMC, but Chandler did. I know how much it hurt him. But we do absolutely know how lucky we have been to be a part of it all and appreciate all the love from fans all these years!”
Riggs the Younger followed suit and spoke briefly about their acceptance to Auburn University:
“I'm taking a gap year right now to focus on acting for a while. Leaving Walking Dead wasn't my decision. I was planning on going to college until I found out. I found out when I was doing rehearsals for episode six back in June. It was quite the shocker for me, Andy and everyone because I don't think anyone saw it coming. It's definitely not a bad thing because it has been awesome being on the show but now I get to go and do a lot of other stuff that I haven't gotten to do before. Scott wanted to meet in person because it was such a big deal. We had just finished rehearsing for a scene in episode six and they wanted to meet with me and my mom and dad and talk about what's going to happen. “I was excited to do a lot of those storylines in the comics because there's a lot of really cool stuff. I'm more excited to do other things than The Walking Dead than I was excited about doing those things on Walking Dead.”
Appearing on AMC's Talking Dead, Gimple was sticking to their story as well, though I trust literally nothing that comes out of the PR side of this show:
“That is a bite on their side.… It will play out as bites play out on the show. It's very important to Carl's story and the entire story, what happens in the next episode. I'm just focused on the fact that Carl right now is alive and they have some business to attend to. That is a one-way ticket. But I'd like to think that the things we see in the next episode are so important to their life and the other characters' lives.”
Right. Like Glenn was originally “dead” back in the day, or the bait-and-switch where Glenn was brutally murdered by Negan (sticking to the comic books, at least) after the fact. It's worth mentioning that, should Carl die on the show, that'll be a big departure from Robert Kirkman‘s comics; should they survive, that'll be a shift from the show's mythology so far. If Andrew Lincoln knows something else, he's not telling:

Right-turns-on-red have always been associated with danger, despite arguments from those who claim otherwise. This is especially true when it comes to pedestrians, who are the most vulnerable in the collision.

TORONTO – Ontario's Liberal Party meets today to hear from Premier Kathleen Wynne, who is expected to deliver a “rally-style” speech to party members for the last time before the coming spring provincial election.
The gathering in downtown Toronto, which enters its second day today, will focus on campaign preparedness, volunteer training and recruitment.
Wynne's speech, expected late Saturday afternoon, is one of two keynote addresses at the weekend event.

On Friday, Wynne again stressed their campaign themes of creating fairness and opportunity for all Ontarians, as they have for months leading up to the election.
“We're entering into a very interesting period,” they said, laughing. “Is that fair to say? And I've got a great team behind me. We're here to talk about the values that are the Liberal values that drive us.”
Touting policies such as the provincial minimum wage increase and free post-secondary tuition, Wynne also said they believe that government should help people do things they can't do for themselves.

“We're not a business,” Wynne said. “We're a caring society and our government has to be an expression of that.”
This year was one to forget for the Ottawa Senators, finishing second-to-last in the NHL after a promising playoff run the year before. As the free agency period has gotten underway, there are many questions that still need to be answered. The Sens have already addressed one question, placing right winger Alex Burrows on waivers to buy them out and free up some cap room ahead of free agency.
With the team surrounded by rumors, here are the three biggest questions to be addressed this offseason.
What's Happening With Erik Karlsson?
Erik Karlsson is the face of the Senators' organization. For the past nine seasons, they have become one of the best players in the NHL. They have won two Norris Trophies as the NHL's best defenseman, been named to the NHL First All-Star Team four times and has helped the Sens reach the playoffs five times. Their 518 points in 627 games don't hurt either.
NHL All-Stars are not easy to come by, and it looks like the Sens might lose theirs. Karlsson's contract ends after the 2018-19 season and the club reportedly offered them an $80-million contract extension on July 1. With no deal in place just one day later, the Senators granted other NHL teams permission to speak with the veteran.
There have been numerous teams looking into Karlsson, with the Vegas Golden Knights initially looking to be the front-runner, reportedly willing to take on Bobby Ryan's $7.25 million contract in a trade. That should be an intriguing inclusion for the Sens. After losing John Tavares, the New York Islanders also look to be in talks to acquire the defenseman. The Isles would greatly benefit from landing Karlsson, not just for their skills on the ice, but for a fanbase in need of some good news. In addition to those clubs, the Dallas Stars have come on recently as a frontrunner to acquire Karlsson.
With the 28-year-old's contract nearing its end, the Sens' captain could become the highest-paid defenseman in NHL history. The Swedish defender has become one of the league's best players and with the salary cap going up year after year everyone has eyes on the potential 2019 free agent's negotiations.
Los Angeles Kings rearguard Drew Doughty recently signed their extension worth just under $11 million over eight years, setting the bar for Karlsson in their contract discussions. With the Senators offering $10 million over 8 years, expect interested teams to offer deals similar, if not higher, to Doughty's.
Will Craig Anderson Be the Starting Goalie?
In an unexpected move, goaltender Craig Anderson asked to be traded. While surprising, the 37-year-old's desire is understandable given that the Sens are just starting to rebuild.
More buzz out of Ottawa 👀.https://t.co/d8CUXAkFiR — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) June 22, 2018
The fact that their two-year, $9.5-million contract kicks in next season may make it difficult to move him, but many teams are looking for a goalie this offseason, including the Islanders, who have been kicking the tires on the availability of the Sens' most successful goalie of all time. That said, the Islanders did sign Robin Lehner on July 3.
However, Dorion has made it clear in the Karlsson discussions that they won't be making a deal if the return isn't to their liking. Anderson is a clear-cut starter in the NHL, and Dorion will be looking for a fair trade in return. If they can't find a deal, expect Anderson to be wearing red in October.
With many of the free agent goaltenders signing July 1, the options looking thin for Ottawa, especially with Lehner, an ex-Senator, signing with the Islanders after not receiving a qualifying offer from the Buffalo Sabres. Last year, Lehner went 23-26-8 with a GAA of 2.68 and save percentage of .920. While these numbers are not remarkable, they'd do well for a rebuilding team.
On the trade front, the Red Wings are reportedly dangling Jimmy Howard who has only one year left on their contract. A trade is even more likely after Detroit signed Jonathan Bernier to a three-year deal. Similar to Lehner, Howard may not be the goalie they once are, but is still a starting-caliber goaltender.
What doesn't appear to be an option, is looking internally. Behind Anderson is Mike Condon, who fans will remember going 5-17-5 last season with a 3.25 GAA. Even for a rebuilding team, those aren't the numbers of a starting goaltender. Whichever avenue Ottawa takes with Anderson, this will be an intriguing story through the offseason if Dorion can make a deal happen.
Can the Sens Move Bobby Ryan?
The Bobby Ryan saga may come to an end this offseason. After an injury-riddled season and a rebuild underway, the Sens should be looking to get out from under the four years and $29 million left on their contract. That is easier said than done though.
Ryan looked like an All-Star with the Anaheim Ducks, putting up at least 31 goals and 57 points in four of their six years there. Those two seasons they scored less were their rookie year and the lockout 2012-13 season. In Ottawa, they haven't hit either of those numbers, falling to just 11 goals and 33 points last season.
The Sens might have difficulty moving a contract like Ryan's, but if the Toronto Maple Leafs were able to unload David Clarkson, anything is possible. The most likely scenario would be for Dorion to bundle Ryan with another asset or take on a bad contract in return, which isn't ideal (see the Marian Gaborik trade).
As David Pagnotta of The Fourth Period suggests, Ryan could be packaged with Karlsson, with at least the Golden Knights and one more team open to that possibility (while the New York Rangers were initially reported to be interested, they now appear to be out of the equation). This would lessen the amount the other team has to send back but would unload a sizable amount of cap space for the Sens.
As we've mentioned over past few days, VGK, NYR and at least one more team has expressed interest in acquiring both Karlsson/Ryan. There are 6-7 other teams after just Karlsson. Told NYI is among them. — David Pagnotta (@TheFourthPeriod) July 2, 2018
If Dorion and company are serious about the rebuild and a Karlsson deal happens, it's likely that Ryan is on their way out of the nation's capital with him. Come October, there may be a very different core group in Ottawa.
As summer approaches, college students are now considering how they are going to spend their free time productively which includes investigating internships. To help facilitate the application process, Associate Professor and Interim Director of Internships for the Media, Film and Journalism (MFJS) department Derigan Silver and DU Career Center director Mary Michael Hawkins have some insight to better Pios' chances of getting an internship.
First, figure out if the internship is right for you.
It's easy to fall under the trap of assuming that you simply need to have an internship for the sake of buffing up your resume. But relevant work experience is important, so ditch the ones that make you go on coffee runs and, as Silver suggests, consider the potential learning value of the opportunity.
If students make it to the interview portion of the process but are still unsure if the opportunity is worth it, Hawkins wants students to ask their interviewer questions to clarify any hesitations they may have.
When it comes to clubs… quality over quantity.
Being a part of an organization will show that a student is well-rounded and not just focused on their or their grades, but it's important to not get overwhelmed and not dabble with numerous clubs. This is Hawkins's biggest recommendation. They want students to pick one or two clubs to be committed enough to and then take on a leadership role or a committee membership with them.
In addition to showing involvement, Silver says to participate in activities “That [are]going to show your work product,” because “[employers]want to see if you can actually do this.” This does not mean the activity must be school related. For MFJS students, Silver provides examples of ways students can show their work: they can have a YouTube channel, have a good social media presence or develop a portfolio site.
Avoid the common mistakes.
In terms of the resume, a common mistake that Hawkins sees is a student's inability to build out their experiences properly. For example, say the student is a server at a restaurant, explains Hawkins. On their resume it should not say, “I waited tables.” Instead, the student should mention the skills learned from the experience: thinking on their feet, providing good customer service or having up-selling/sales skills.
Another common mistake Hawkins points out is students “using complete sentences instead of statements and action verbs” on their resumes. Students should have their resumes be clear and concise and lack “I” statements. Using verbs ending with “-ed” or “-ing” is a safe bet.
For cover letters, it's important to avoid using a template. No one wants that embarrassing moment of having two different organizations mentioned in the same letter. “If they can see that you have spent some time understanding their business, looking at the job description and how you fit with that job description, that time will be well spent,” said Hawkins.
Also, for any document students submit to a potential internship or job, be aware of the dreaded grammar errors and know that there is a good balance of black and white.
Don't panic.
It's normal to feel stressed with the application process, especially in the middle of the already busy quarter. To ease the anxiety, Hawkins encourages students to just get started. “The stress of thinking ‘I need to do this, I need to do this,' and not doing anything just compounds itself. I can't tell you how many students walk out of our office and say, ‘Thank you, I feel so much better' because they've started the process,” they said.

The skipper of the Silver Shadow gets a surprise with their morning tea — Mouse Woman, ready to tell them the story of Kuuga Kuns and Naa-Naa-Simgat, the rescue tale at the centre of Christopher Auchter's animated short, The Mountain of SGaana. (Image courtesy Christopher Auchter)
Cruising to fish one morning on the Silver Shadow, a bored skipper zones out in the glow of their cellphone.
The radio crackles, their tea kettle stirs, and a mouse dressed in Haida regalia hops out from their tea cup with a ball of yarn.
Mouse Woman taps one knitting needle on a can of milk to get the skipper's wide-eyed attention, but they don't say a word.
Instead, their paws whir as they quickly knit them a blanket that tells the story of Kuuga Kuns, who dove deep into the ocean to rescue their beloved Naa-Naa-Simgat from the undersea mountain where they were taken by a great killer whale.
The Mountain of SGaana (Trailer) from NFB/marketing on Vimeo.
Written and directed by Haida animator Christopher Auchter, The Mountain of SG̱aana is a 10-minute film that contains a world of Haida story, and its only words are in Haida song.
Without spoken words, Auchter says, language isn't a barrier.
“It could really do what I was hoping the film could do — travel the world so that other people could see the beauty of our stories.”
Speaking from Vancouver, where the film is now showing at the Vancouver International Film Festival (it's also set for at least two screenings on Haida Gwaii), Auchter said they did plan to have Kuuga Kuns speak when they first started writing the film nearly three years ago.
But when National Film Board producers Michael Fukushima and Shirley Vercruysse suggested they try a wordless script, Auchter jumped at the idea.
“It was a really good challenge as a storyteller,” they said.
Judging by its first award, The Mountain of SG̱aana is visually clear and fun to watch, too — two weeks ago, a jury of school kids chose it for Best Animated Film for Young Audiences Ages 6 to 12 at the Ottawa International Animation Festival.
As it happens, that's about how old Auchter was when they first heard the story of Mouse Woman, one of their favourite Haida characters.
They were in Grade 3 in Queen Charlotte, and a substitute teacher read the story, or started to.
“When the bell rang, the story never did get finished,” they said.
The next day, another teacher read another story, and they never heard the end.
“Maybe it was better that I didn't know, because it allowed my imagination to keep going,” they said.
Auchter would go on to learn media arts at Emily Carr, and computer animation at Sheridan College. The first NFB short they worked on was Daniel Janke's How People Got Fire, which tells a Tlingit story, and besides animating characters in Nintendo and Electronic Arts videogames, they created shorts for the APTN children's series Tansi Nehiyawetan.
But everything Auchter needed to create The Mountain of SG̱aana, they learned from Haida Gwaii.
The Silver Shadow was their grandfather Bruce Hageman's fishing boat, and starting just before high school, Auchter joined them as a deckhand for seven summers.
“Some of the best times of my life were spent on that boat with him,” they said.
Only when they started doing research for the film did Auchter realize the Bill Reid pole at the Haida Heritage Centre actually shows characters from the Naa-Naa-Simgat story.
Once they found out, they asked their mother Tracey Auchter to go photograph it from all sorts of angles.
“I always looked at that pole, my whole life growing up,” they said. “The story I'm telling now was right in front of me all those years.”
In Auchter's telling, the story is flipped so that it's Kuuga Kuuns, not Naa-Naa-Simgat, who braves the sgaana and rescues their lover from transformation into a supernatural (In Haida language, sg̱aana means both “killer whale” and “supernatural”).
And in the film, it's their sister Nikita who actually signs Kuuga Kuns' three Haida songs. One song was given to the Yaghulaanas clan by a rescued shark. Another is a comforting lullaby sung in a storm, and the third was written as a song of thanks by a nearly-drowned man (it proves very good at keeping Kuuga Kuns out from the soup of a giant halibut).
“I didn't know they could sing like that, and I'm not even sure my parents knew,” Auchter said. In fact, they and Nikita kept them singing a secret right up until the day their parents finally saw it. It was quite a surprise.
“Nikita kept that concealed from all of us all these years.”
Even the small characters in Auchter's film are ones people here will recognize.
Good-For-Nothing Marten slinks alongside Kuuga Kuns on their journey, just as a shadow followed Auchter the summer they and their uncle Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas worked as Haida Watchmen at SG̱aang Gwaay.
“There were these three mornings in a row that I got up super early and I thought, ‘Oh, I'll just go for a walk along the boardwalk to the village there, Ninstints.'”
“I could see this shadow underneath my feet on the boardwalk, and every time I reached the stairs I could see a little bit more — just this quick little shadow glimpse.”
On the third day, the shadow got the best of him, and Auchter stopped to peek under the boardwalk. The creature darted off across a tree, and never appeared again.
Yaghulaanas suggested it was Good-For-Nothing Marten, and even threatened to make that Auchter's Haida name.
To tell a story that could easily fill a feature film in 10 short minutes, Auchter sometimes uses split frames.
When the bored skipper on the Silver Shadow first appears, the frames are straight and black.
But as Mouse Woman tells them the story, the frames not only take on their shape, but also the shape of Haida formline.
“I was giving a little nod of my cedar hat to my Uncle Mike,” they said, laughing. “He does that with their beautiful graphic novels.”
As in the original Haida story, when Kuuga Kuns and Naa-Naa-Simgat are finally reunited, they return to find that time has passed super quickly in the supernatural world.
In Auchter's telling, they actually arrive in present day, in a canoe by the Silver Shadow.
“I just liked the symbolism of that,” they said.
“Haida culture is not gone, it's not just in the past,” they said. “It's here in the present — we're trying so hard to revitalize our language, and young people are taking action.”
When the young skipper finally throws a tow line from the Silver Shadow to the Haida canoe, Auchter said, he's pulling that culture closer.
For a movement that announced itself with a proverbial flatline, with Cristi Puiu's dry, sardonic, darkly comic “The Death of Mr. Lazarescu” (2005), the Romanian New Wave seems poised for a dramatic rebirth.
More than a decade after Puiu took home the Un Certain Regard Award, and Cristian Mungiu won the Palme d'Or in 2007 for their harrowing abortion drama, “4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days,” Romanian cinema is on the brink of a “new New Wave,” says Transilvania Intl. Film Festival artistic director Mihai Chirilov.
As the fest unspools its essential Romanian Days program, beginning on May 30, audiences are witnessing “first-time filmmakers that… are completely different than the aesthetic of the New Wave,” says Chirilov. Breaking from the muted palettes, flat compositions, and slow-burn realism of their predecessors, they're bringing “a more than welcome freshness to what Romanian cinema is, and the idea of how Romanian cinema is perceived abroad.”
Headlining the program of 13 features and 22 shorts is “Touch Me Not,” Adina Pintilie's bold, Golden Bear-winning exploration of intimacy, told in a genre-blurring style that blends fiction and documentary. The filmmaker's debut in Berlin “took everyone by surprise,” says Chirilov, adding, “It's something that hadn't been seen in Romanian cinema ever before.”

Another stirring debut is Ivana Mladenovic's “Soldiers. A Story from Ferentari,” which premiered in competition in San Sebastian. An unconventional love story about a queer couple in a marginalized Roma community in Bucharest, its daring exploration of gay love tackles “one of the most controversial topics in Romanian film,” says Chirilov.
Five of the 13 features in the Romanian Days competition are world premieres, including first-time director Bogdan Theodor Olteanu's “Several Conversations About a Very Tall Girl,” about two girls forced to question themselves at the start of a love affair, and actor Vlad Zamfirescu's directorial debut “The Secret of Happiness,” a cynical comedy about the buried secrets and uncomfortable truths that emerge from a love triangle.
Director Paul Negoescu, whose low-budget sophomore feature, “Two Lottery Tickets,” became the surprise, top-grossing film of 2016, also returns to Transilvania with “The Story of a Summer Lover,” a comedy about a womanizing professor who's forced to grow up when their girlfriend becomes pregnant.
Collectively these films represent a break from the recent past. “Ever since the Romanian New Wave popped up, many first-time filmmakers tried to employ the same technique, the same aesthetic. They knew deep down that this is the trend,” says Chirilov. “Most of the first-time works were pale copies of the great films of the Romanian New Wave… [but] not necessarily in tune with what the filmmakers wanted to make.” Copying the New Wave aesthetic, though, was “a sure ticket to an international film festival.”
Of the new generation, they say, “What you are sure about is they really believe in what they are doing.”
An encouraging trend is how Romanian films are playing to local audiences. Chirilov points to the success of Daniel Sandu's “One Step Behind the Seraphim,” a coming-of-age story set in an Orthodox seminary, which surpassed box-office expectations while winning most of the top honors at this year's Gopo Awards, the local equivalent of the Oscars. “The audience needs this type of film,” they say, pointing to a long-running debate in the Romanian industry about how to create a more populist national cinema.
Local filmmakers agree. “The Romanian New Wave was a beautiful and amazing thing. It had to happen. People finally discovered Romanian cinema,” says Andrei Cretulescu, whose off-beat black comedy, “Charleston,” which world premiered in Locarno last year, has its Romanian premiere May 30.
“But now is the right time to do different things. Now is the right time to explore new genres and new ways of making cinema,” they say. “We're into a new stage, and I think that will benefit everybody.”

July 1 was an interesting day for the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Columbus Blue Jackets castoff defenseman Jack Johnson smiled like the Cheshire cat while being introduced to the Pittsburgh media.
Also in a surprise move, the Penguins brought back a familiar face in the form of 41-year old Matt Cullen.
These moves give general manager Jim Rutherford 13 NHL-ready forwards and six defensemen. So that's all they wrote for the offseason, right?
According to Rutherford, maybe not.
Jim Rutherford said they aren't going to close the door on the trade market and suggested there would be more trades – leaguewide – in 2-3 more weeks. This was the same man who pulled off the Brandon Sutter/Nick Bonino trade on July 28 of the 2015 offseason. — Seth Rorabaugh (@SethRorabaugh) July 1, 2018
Many in the hockey world anticipated a big Penguins trade during the draft, and again at the start of free agency, but no blockbusters as of yet. This may be the roster that coach Mike Sullivan begins the season with, and that's OK.
I have become fairly optimistic about Rutherford's additions, and the chances of this club as currently constructed. But today I'd like to take a look at some possible moves that could happen prior to the start of the 2018-19 campaign.
The Pros and Cons of Trading for Jeff Skinner
This is a well-traveled rumor that picked up steam around the draft but appears to have fizzled recently. Jeff Skinner seems to be poorly utilized in Carolina and could benefit from time with an elite centerman such as Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin.
As you can see, Skinner would be a drastic upgrade in the top-six, even over a valued winger like Carl Hagelin. Under the right circumstances, Skinner could be one of the better goal scorers in the league, but they have struggled with inconsistency. The 26-year-old has topped the 30-goal mark twice in their career and is only one year removed from scoring 37 in the 2016-17 season. Imagine if they could find consistency under Sullivan while playing with other dynamic forwards.
This sounds great, but there is a reason that the Hurricanes would be looking to trade the former first-round pick.  They are entering the final year of a contract which, according to Cap Friendly, already pays them nearly $6 million per season. If they were to come to Pittsburgh and score 40 goals, that number would skyrocket. As the hockey world witnessed with John Tavares, there are dangers with stars looking for a big payday.
A likely return coming from the Penguins in a trade could look something like Carl Hagelin, Tristan Jarry, and a high draft pick. That's a pretty steep price for what would likely be a rental player. I do like the idea of their talent in black and gold, but fans should not get too attached if they do come to the Steel City. Remember Marian Hossa?
Trading Brassard Is Still Not Out of the Question
Trading Derick Brassard is the nagging rumor that won't go away.
I offered up a question to my Twitter followers recently asking if they are comfortable with Riley Sheahan and Matt Cullen being the Penguins' bottom-six centers in the event of a Brassard deal. The resounding answer was “no.”
Common sense suggests that moving the former Senator would not be in the club's best interests, yet the chatter still persists.
The most linked team in the conversation is the Montreal Canadiens, and looking at their roster, there are few options that line up. Max Pacioretty is the first name that comes to mind, and left wing is a bit of a need for the Penguins, but unless they can work another center into the mix, it feels like robbing Peter to pay Paul.
I'm not saying a Brassard move could not happen, but the return has to be a home run. Especially considering what they gave up to get him.
Small Surprises May Be in Store
The Penguins' roster feels like it's set for the start of the season, but don't be shocked if you see some surprise moves come out of left field.
Before free agency started, Rutherford locked up youngster Daniel Sprong to a two-year contract, so they are not going anywhere. However, it would not be a surprise to see Sprong's fellow up-and-comer Zach Aston-Reese be involved in a deal for a more established player.
Another player that could potentially be moved is Olli Maatta. The Finnish defender has been through the rumor mill before, though a move isn't likely as the Penguins seem content with their blueline.
Then there is still the possibility of Anthony Duclair signing as a free agent. It would be interesting to see where they would fit, especially after the Cullen signing. But they would be a welcome addition to a bottom-six that struggled last season.
Prior to the start of free agency, Matt Gajtka from Pittsburgh Hockey Now suggested that the Penguins could be interested in Duclair and discussed how they could positively impact the club.
With Chicago, Duclair played in 23 games, recording three goals and five assists. They have been a positive possession player in relation to their team in each of four NHL seasons, boasting a plus-2.8 percent Corsi Relative. Their speed and hands would seem to fit with a Penguins team that plays aggressively, especially with left wing looking a little thin on the depth chart.
Truthfully, at this point, no trade or free-agent signing would surprise me. In recent years the Penguins have pulled off deals at all times of the season and offseason, so be prepared for any scenario. After all, Rutherford is a magician.
Just ask John Tortorella.
Until next time.
KHYBER AGENCY - Security officials Monday said that condition of producing a valid Pakistani passport at the border with Afghanistan for entering or leaving Pakistan would be re-imposed after two days.
The officials said that the waiver granted in passport condition to Pakistani citizens was extended for two more days to facilitate the travelers on both sides of the border.
The officials said after expiry of the extended period, Pakistani citizens entering or leaving Pakistan would have to produce valid Pakistani passport at the Pak-Afghan border.
During the waiver period, Pakistani citizens are allowed to enter into Pakistan from Afghanistan by showing the National Identity Card only.
While briefing media persons at Michni Post in tehsil Landi Kotal, an FC official said after April 18, nobody would be allowed to cross the Torkham border without a valid passport. They said that government was making all out efforts to manage the Torkham border as international border and added that Pak-Afghan people would be facilitated to move across the border with passport and legal travelling documents.
“Enjoy a light, social high,” says the funky bottle of California Dreamin' cannabis-infused sparkling pomegranate juice. Launching today at Y Combinator Demo Day, California Dreamin' is serving up an alcohol alternative that still gets you lit, but without the same hangover or health issues.
Each bottle contains 10 milligrams of THC — an industry-standard dose of the psychoactive chemical in marijuana. The company only uses sativa, the more energizing, euphoric type of pot, compared to the more body-relaxing indica variety. That's compared to some competing marijuana beverages with as much as 100mg — enough that a single sip will get you high and a bottle will lay out all but the hardiest stoners. “We want it to be a light, head high feel,” says Seven Cities Beverage Company aka California Dreamin' co-founder Amy Ludlum. “We don't want to give anyone couch lock. We want it to be social.”
Meanwhile, the taste marries fruity sweetness with a hint of earthy plant life complexity that will titillate long-time cannabis fans. Bottles come in other flavors, like tangerine, grapefruit and cranberry apple, and will retail for about $8 to $10 each. Cases are rolling out to recreational dispensaries in San Francisco, like The Barbary Coast, over the next week.
California Dreamin' has succeeded in creating a beverage with the light-hearted brand, logical dosage and agreeable taste to be something you can drink casually and socially, not just when you want to get ridiculously high. That makes it a better alternative or complement to drinking alcohol. It's certainly not for everyone. Paranoia, anxiety and post-high grogginess are all common side-effects of sativa, and you shouldn't drive while blazed. But there are plenty of people who want an option to unwind that doesn't involve a literal poison, or smoking a burning plant that can hurt your lungs.
The only problem is that California and other states with legal recreational marijuana ban the sale of anything cannabis related anywhere that serves alcohol. That means you aren't likely to see California Dreamin' in a bar any time soon, but you could throw a pretty fun backyard barbecue. But with 1 million medical marijuana users out of 28 million California adults, and with over half of the voting population supporting cannabis legalization, there's plenty of room to build a brand in this space.
Inebriation is America's true national pastime. You could see it as people just seeking an escape from daily troubles, but it's also a way to shift our thinking to get a new perspective on the world. Considering how much we pay for entertainment that's merely stimulus we filter through our perception, $10 to pleasantly alter that perception is not a half-baked idea.
For years in Quebec, it's been illegal to light up inside public spaces, but now, the town of Hampstead is going one step further.
“Walking down the street, in the parks, in our town hall, you cannot smoke,” said William Steinberg, mayor of Hampstead.
It could soon be against the law in Hampstead to smoke on all municipal property — that includes parks, streets and even sidewalks.
READ MORE: Montreal suburb seeks ban on smoking in all public spaces
Steinberg says the rule protects people's health and sends a strong anti-smoking message.
“Our bylaw is geared both to tobacco and once it's legalized, cannabis,” they said. “For the same sort of reasons — harmful effects of second-hand smoke and the example for young kids.”
Hampstead would not be the first community to adopt such a strict anti-smoking rule.
In the town of Kentville, N.S., it's been illegal to smoke on public property since 2010.

According to the Hampstead bylaw, the town could fine a first-time offender anywhere between $100 and $300.
If you are caught a second time, the infraction could be as high as $600.
“What Hampstead is doing, I think is really going to put this issue on the national agenda for municipalities from coast-to-coast,” said Ron Cunningham, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
But surprisingly, Quebec's Non-Smokers' Rights Association has concerns about the bylaw.
READ MORE: Quebec to ban smoking in prisons; ‘added tensions' expected
They fear other cities and boroughs will also eventually adopt similar rules, leading to bigger problems, as pushing smoking back indoors.
“You might have a couple where, for example, the husband smokes but the wife doesn't so they ask them to go outdoors and smoke, to be careful of the children,” said François Damphousse, director of the Non-Smokers' Rights Association in Quebec.
“He's gonna say to their wife, ‘I can't smoke outdoors anymore,' so he's gonna go back indoors, and expose their family to second-hand smoke.”
Like it or not, the no-smoking rule in the town could be in effect by the end of the week.

The federal government will complete its constitutionally mandated five year term midnight today, thus becoming second democratically elected government in the country's seventy year history to achieve a major milestone, which according to political observers angered well for democracy.
The National Assembly will hold its final sitting at the parliament house today with members from both opposition and treasury benches likely to give their farewell speech.
During its five year tenure, the lower assembly passed a series of very important legislation including anti honour and anti rape as well as Acid and Burn Crime act.
Most recently, it passed with two thirds majority the historic 31st Constitution Amendment paving the way for merger of FATA with tribal areas.
During the last few days, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also addressed three news conferences highlighting the performance of the government in economic, energy and oil and gas sectors. Foreign Minister Khurram Dastagir will also address a news conference at the foreign office today to articulate the successes achieved by the incumbent government on the foreign policy front.
It merits mentioning here that when the present government took power, it was faced with serious challenges on the economic, energy and security fronts. Political pundits give credit to the present government for initiating decisive action against the terrorists following the attack on APS after developing consensus amongst the political parties which led to improvement of overall security situation across the country including Karachi and Balochistan.
Reforms in the energy sector also significantly reduced power outages but issues such as circular debt and line losses still pose a major challenge. Whilst on the economic front, the government has to its credit certain achievements such as increasing the growth rate but the current account deficit and stagnant exports are still matters that need to be fixed and to be a challenge for the next government.

LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - British aerospace and defence electronics group Cobham said on Friday it has agreed to sell its AvComm and Wireless test businesses to Viavi Solutions for $455 million, as part of the latest stage of a turnaround plan.
Cobham, which had said in August that it may divest the units, plans to use the proceeds to reduce debt, further strengthening its balance sheet after a string of profit warnings forced it into a rights issue last year.
The company said it would be able to pay down about 440 million pounds ($627 million) of debt by combining the proceeds from the deal with existing cash.
The Wireless unit, which does 5G mobile network testing, and communications equipment maker AvComm, together account for around 10 percent of Cobham's revenue. The group acquired AvComm through its ill-fated Aeroflex acquisition in 2014, which increased its debt burden.
Chief Executive David Lockwood, who took over in 2016 to lead a turnaround, had said there was little overlap between the Wireless and AvComm units and the rest of the business and the sale followed a competitive process.
“We can now focus on delivering value-add technology and capabilities to our defence, aerospace and space customers, supported by a more resilient balance sheet,” they said.
AvComm is based in the U.S., while the Wireless unit, is based in Britain, said Cobham, adding that the deal is expected to complete in the first half of this year.
Shares in Cobham closed at 124.8 pence on Thursday, valuing the company at 3 billion pounds. ($1 = 0.7018 pounds) (Reporting by Sarah Young, editing by James Davey)
Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa seems like a pleasant person, but they remind us of a used car salesperson whenever he's selling their upcoming budget.
One who doesn't want you looking under the hood too closely while he's making their sales pitch.
On Thursday, Sousa boasted to The Empire Club in Toronto that their fifth budget on April 27 will demonstrate that, "Ontario is the leanest government with the lowest per-capita spending of any province."
Um, that's been true for Ontario governments going back decades.
Since Ontario has the largest population of any province, it also has the advantage of economies of scale when delivering public services.
The Bill Davis Progressive Conservative government, for example, made exactly the same boast in 1981-82 that Sousa made Thursday.
When the Liberals are in power, they always boast about delivering services at the lowest per-capita cost of any province.
When they're out of power, they always blame the party in power for not spending enough on government services. (In fairness, all parties do it.)
What Sousa didn't say is that the Liberals have more than doubled Ontario's debt to more than $300 billion since coming to power in 2003, which has made Ontario the most indebted sub-sovereign (non-national) borrower in the world.
They didn't say the auditor general and Ontario's Financial Accountability Office have warned the Liberals that they have plunged the province into precarious levels of debt.
Sousa claimed the Liberal scheme to borrow even more money from Ontario taxpayers to subsidize the electricity bills of hydro ratepayers -- even though they're the same people -- is "fairer because it doesn't ask today's generation alone to pay the entire freight."
That argument turns generations of fiscally prudent thinking -- that you don't stick future generations with huge bills to pay for today's services -- on its head.
Finally, Sousa repeated, for the umpteenth time, that this year's budget will be balanced, later adding along with "next year and the year after that."
Two problems. First, Sousa's promising to balance a budget that won't come down until after the next Ontario election in 2018.
Second, in 2003, then Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty promised before the election not to raise our taxes.
And we all remember what happened after they won.
“The Bachelorette” returned on Monday night with one of the most beloved stars the show has seen in quite some time — Becca Kufrin, who had their heart broken on national TV in one of the most controversial “Bachelor” moments in the franchise's history.
After heartbreak, Kufrin has revealed that they are engaged by the end of their season. But what happens before the proposal?
Variety caught up with ABC executive Rob Mills, who heads reality programming for the network, to find out what to expect in Season 14. “It was really a roller coaster,” Mills says of Kufrin's season.
As for Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham's wedding, Mills teases whether or not the nuptials will be televised, quipping, “You can never leave ‘The Bachelor' family.”
Here, Mills details “The Bachelorette” Season 14, Arie and Lauren's wedding, plus an update on “Bachelor In Paradise.”
It took a lot to get here with Becca being “The Bachelorette,” after all the drama on Arie's season. Are you happy with choosing them as the leading lady?
I'm thrilled with this season. Every season of “The Bachelor” and “Bachelorette” always succeeds to a certain extent, but for it to be an all-timer, a bunch of different things have to go right and this just felt like a confluence of things coming together — Becca is someone who people are really excited to see find love again, after what happened with Arie, and just them as the bachelorette seems so strong and self-assured and funny and smart and really into all of the guys, which allowed for a great season, and then that led to one of our strongest crops of guys, if not the best.

Why do you think it was one of the strongest group of male contestants the show has ever had?
It's hard to put my finger on it. I don't know why we got such a strong crop, but we really, really did. They definitely all loved Becca. I think it helped that Becca is into all different types of guys so they had a lot of different personalities. This is one of our stronger crops of guys we've ever had — just really interesting, fun guys that are great. There will be a lot of people to root for. I know we use this word a lot, but it really is going to be a great journey for the fans.
Given that Becca is into all different types of guys, did that help with casting, when it came to diversity?
We've made a real conscious effort to make the show more diverse, and I think we've definitely succeeded over the last few years. We can put diversity in the cast, but sometimes they won't stick around as long as others because you can't tell somebody that they have to like this person, so that certainly did help. But it also doesn't help if you don't have guys who are great, and these guys were absolutely fantastic, no matter what their backgrounds or race is or anything else.
What can you tease about how this season ends up? Becca has said that she's engaged.
It's hard. It's a testament to how strong they are and what a good head they have on their shoulders that they made it through in one piece. Something happens early on where one of the guys says, “I thought I was telling you what you wanted to hear,” and then they go into post-traumatic stress from Arie because that's what Arie did. So it was a real roller coaster for them to get there, really literally right up until the final minute. It's sort of amazing that is been trial by fire, but the couple — Becca and their fiance — are super strong, and I think they're going to be one of our forever couples.
You said Becca's decision is going to be up until the final moment, so does that means that viewers truly won't have an idea of who Becca picks until the very end?
Yeah. Them type is really every type. So it's not like you can see [who they are going to end up with]. I would probably compare them to Ali [Fedotowsky] because they were into all different types of guys. It's going to be surprising every week for people to see who goes home.
Every season, Chris Harrison says, “It's the most dramatic season ever,” but last season, that really delivered with Arie. How would you compare this season?
It's very dramatic, and it's very emotional. If you look at Arie's season up until the final four hours, it wasn't quite as dramatic because there were some girls who weren't necessarily into Arie. Here, there are a lot of guys who are in love with Becca.  They are a one in a million woman. That makes it very real. These guys aren't here to stick around because they want to travel or because they just want the experience [of a TV show] — they want Becca. It's dramatic from the minute it starts. It's a lot of real human drama.
Speaking of contestants being there for the right reasons, how do you avoid casting people who just want fame, especially in the age of the Instagram star?
It's getting easier to weed them out. You just sort of know who they are, so you just stop putting them on the show. It's not quite the same thing, but on “Shark Tank,” you can tell there are people who just want their product on TV, but don't really want to hear from the sharks, so we don't air them on the show anymore. I think having people who are really solid, driven, professional people, like this cast, that helps. There is a character that's going to be very talked about — Jordan, who is a male model. For better or worse, the world needs male models, and the guy takes it very seriously. But from the moment we met them in casting, they didn't seem like they were doing this to further their career. They did it because they aren't meeting the right type of women, and they wanted to use the show as another way to meet a woman. Just really making a conscious effort to find the right types of guys has really paid off.
Was the entire process tough for Becca, after having their entire breakup — raw footage and all — aired on national TV?
I think they were ready. Arie and them broke up in January, the finale aired in March and then their season started in late month, so they had a few months of closure. It wasn't like it happened a week ago. She's also somebody who has gone through other traumas — their father passed away — and when you have those things happen, when you come out of it the other side, you realize that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and you also realize that you need to take chances. They walked in and was just fully ready to take a chance.
How do you feel about the decision to air the finale last season with all of the raw footage? There was some backlash to airing that footage.
Taking the feelings side, it certainly was a great TV moment. You saw “SNL” parodying it in the cold open six days later, so we clearly touched a nerve in the national consciousness. I still feel the same way that I did when we first watched it — it seemed too powerful to try and cut down because we wanted to tell the whole story, and let the audience see and judge for themselves. Instead of this being a he-said-she-said, it's all there so you could make your own decisions. I think there was a contingency that this was invasive or exploiting a private moment, and everyone is certainly entitled to their opinions, but also, [the cast] says that they're going to tell their story on TV. The other thing is both Arie and Becca have come off unscathed. Becca is unbelievable happy, and this has been such an amazing experience for her, and Arie and Lauren are getting married in January.
Will you be showing any more raw, unedited footage this upcoming season?
The one thing we really liked was the footage of the couple after the engagement. These people are real life couples and they live in the real world after. They're just getting to know each other as just two people, opposed to one person dating 25 people. So we will incorporate some of that. I certainly hope that Becca or their fiance does not have a change of heart and we have to shoot one of those things again, so we certainly have no plans for that, but I hope you will see the happy couple together as an engaged couple.
Did you ever offer Arie and Lauren a TV wedding?
Honestly, I didn't know about this until I watched [Arie and Lauren announce their wedding date] on “The View” myself. My suspicion is they probably want a measure of privacy. I don't think they've been a couple that people have been particular kind to, so they probably didn't want a bunch of people hate-watching their wedding. For us, we're just thrilled that they did find love. They went through this really painful experience and are going get married. So we're happy for them.
Are there any plans to televise any of Arie and Lauren's wedding?
I'm sure we'll include the wedding in some way in the show, and we'll have Arie and Lauren on one of our specials. You can never leave “The Bachelor” family.
The ratings were down last season. Did the network make any changes this season to try to increase numbers?
When you make knee jerk reactions to things, usually they end up biting you. Here, we knew what we had in Becca, which was a solid Bachelorette. The biggest thing we could do here ratings-wise was had a story and guys that you care about, and I think we accomplished that, so I think our ratings are actually going to be up. You're not going to see any major format changes — if anything, we'll be back to basics this season.
Are there any more “Bachelor” spinoffs in the works?
Not right now, but certainly if an idea comes up, we would never count it out. “The Bachelor” is a brand that can expand to really kind of anything.
What can you tease for the upcoming season of “Bachelor In Paradise?”
From Arie's season and Becca's season, anyone that had unresolved issues or things they didn't carry over will probably be brought to Mexico. I don't think there was anyone we really wanted that we didn't get. We're absolutely thrilled. It's going to be a fantastic season.
Season 2 “Bachelorette” Meredith Phillips recently came out with allegations of being drugged and sexually assaulted on the set of their season. I know you were not at the network at the time, but in light of their allegations and the “Bachelor In Paradise” allegations, what steps do the production take to make sure that set is a safe environment?
In terms of “Bachelor In Paradise,” they did a thorough investigation and found no wrongdoing, but everybody looked at that to make sure that we're doing everything we possibly can to ensure that nothing like this would ever happen — not ever happen again, but just never happen. In terms of Meredith, there's really not even anyone who works on “The Bachelor” right now who was there at that time, but I know that the set right now, they go to absolutely extreme measures to ensure that it's as safe of an environment as it can possibly be, and as you've seen, there have really been no incidents.
5 Steps to Help You Start a Small Business
Running a business has many advantages. It provides you additional source of income that eventually can bring in more money than your day job provides you. However, there are also disadvantages like what if it didn't work out? This and other disadvantages usually scares out people from starting their own business. Well, if you do not do something, how will you know the outcome of it? Thus, it is better to try and do your best for it to grow.
The most challenging part in running a business is starting. You must overcome this stage and the rest will be more bearable. Therefore, in this article, we will share 5 steps to help you overcome the most challenging part.
Step 1: Think of a business plan
What do you think you can offer that will gain support from a lot of people? Do you love to bake and you think baking cupcakes, cakes, and other pastries will receive love from friends and other people? Then you can start a bakery or if you don't have a budget yet then you can start receiving orders and then do the delivery by yourself or have it picked up from your house.
Think of a business plan based on your strength, interests, hobbies or ideas close to your heart.
Step 2: Study the market and your competition
Once you know what business to venture, it is time to study the market. You should see if the demand is high. It is also a good idea to know what type of market can be targeted by your business plan. And of course, you must study your competition. Are they doing great? What are the things that you can offer that they are currently not offering? Research is very important.
Step 3: Find reliable people to help you
Hiring a lot of people is not necessary most especially if you are planning a small business only. However, you may do well with a business partner to help you where you are lacking. For example, get a business partner who is good in accounting and who can help you with numbers.
Step 4: Apply for a small business loan
Of course, you need to plan how you will fund your business too. You can apply for a small business loan online or if you have savings then you can use it too. Just make sure you have enough budget to start.
Step 5: Come up with marketing plan
Lastly, you should come up with strategies on how to promote your business. Think of gimmicks or offers that will encourage customers to support your product/services. A strong marketing plan will help you succeed.
Do not be afraid to start a business most especially if you think you have a great idea. There are indeed challenges and disadvantages that might scare you off but do not give up easily. Try your best and wait for the outcome. If you does not try because you are afraid to fail, then nothing will happen to you including the great advantages and outcome of a successful business.
If you are afraid to take risks, then maybe you can start small. And then work your way up. It is a lot better to start slow and steady than do nothing at all.
How to Manage Your Day-to-Day Tasks
Any business owner or manager will be able to relate to feeling as though there are not enough hours in the day. So much to do, and not enough time to do it – sound familiar?
To be a successful entrepreneur means being organised, and if you are not organised then you need to get organised – fast. If you fail to get your affairs in order then, sooner or later, you will become bogged down with issues that could have easily been avoided.
Make a To-Do List
The first thing that any entrepreneur should do at the end of every day is to make a to-do list of all of the tasks that need to be completed the following day. Try not to leave this until the morning, this way you have one last task to complete, and you are less likely to forget an important task overnight.
List your daily tasks in order of importance, ensuring that you tackle tasks of high importance first. This means that important tasks will not be left until the end of the day, when you may be tempted to rush them instead of taking your time to ensure they are completed properly.
Business owners and entrepreneurs can give themselves the added motivation of once they have completed their tasks – no matter how early – they can finish for the day.
Write Down How Long Each Task Will Take
One technique that many managers take is to make a note of how long each task will take. This then makes it much easier to schedule tasks into your day. Allow for discrepancies in timing – some will be finished sooner than you though, and some will take longer – when you schedule your day.
For example, if you believe a task will take you an hour-and-a-half to complete, schedule two hours for this task allowing for time to overrun. This way, in the event that you do take longer than you thought, you are not behind in your day.
Do Not Work Through Lunch
If you can help to do so, never work through your lunch. Working throughout the day without a break is not healthy, physically or mentally. Even if you take just a few minutes to go for a walk, it is better than sitting at your desk without a single break.
More often than not, when you return to your tasks after a break you will see things in a new light. Something that you may have originally been stuck with can seem a lot easier after a small break.
Keep a Fresh Head
It cannot be understated just how important it is to keep fresh when running or building a business. If you find something that works for you, then stick to it, whether that means investing in a coffee subscription if you believe it is best, working with music on or anything else.
When we become stressed and/or tired, we soon begin to make sloppy mistakes and irrational decisions that we soon regret. As someone responsible for the running of a business, these could have detrimental effects on the future of your company and career.
Delegate
Lastly, do not be afraid to delegate tasks if you feel that you are taking on too much. If you have a team around you, then utilise it as the best employees will be more than happy to take on extra responsibility.
Far too many owners find it hard to let go, which in one way is commendable but almost always end up ultimately becoming the downfall of the business. Delegation is not only good for you as the owner or manager but provides the opportunity for team members to make the step up, which can only be good for the business as a whole.
By taking on even just a couple of the tips listed above, you will soon be reaping the benefits of being better organised and extra time in your day.
ALLEN PARK >> When asked about the wide receiver group on Wednesday, Lions coach Jim Caldwell gave credit to Marvin Jones Jr.
I think Marvin started out (last) season extremely well. Hes been doing even better this spring. Hes had one of those springs that you kind of look to, Caldwell said. This guy is right there on the verge of maintaining that kind of explosive start that they had last year. Hes really, really had a real good spring.
If you remember, Jones had 18 catches for 411 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the Lions first three games in 2016. They finished the season  their first in Detroit  with 55 receptions for 930 yards and four touchdowns.
Obviously the goal is to play every game like they did early last season.

In the offseason, before they came back to Detroit, they worked out in North Carolina with Randy Moss, the retired six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver.
We were really going at it. Me and them and competing and stuff like that. I was getting a lot of insight from them in terms of what I wanted to focus on including lower body strength and yards after catch and staying friendly. There were a lot of things I got from them us being on the field for two hours, Jones said.
Specifically one of the key things they learned was about creating distance and space by being friendly.
One of the biggest things, especially for wide receivers, that aids and helps your ability to take it the distance after the catch. Is basically staying friendly. If you have an in-breaking route, come back negative. If you come back and drift a little bit that one step the safety could get you or the corner could come tackle your legs instead of when youre going friendly to the quarterback and negative, it creates distance and space. We were talking about a lot of stuff like that and kept repping it for hours, its been great, Jones said.
Training camp dates announced
Seven Lions training camp sessions will be open to the public starting on July 31.
One of those open days will be family day at Ford Field at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 5.
The other six will take place at the Lions headquarters and training facility. The dates for those are:
July 31  Gates open at 2:30 p.m., practice at 3:30 p.m.
Aug. 1  Gates open at 2:30 p.m., practice at 3:30 p.m.
Aug. 2  Gates open at 2:30 p.m., practice at 3:30 p.m.
Aug. 4  Gates open at 8 a.m., practice at 9 a.m.
Aug. 6  Gates open at 2:30 p.m., practice at 3:30 p.m.
Aug. 7  Gates open at 1 p.m., practice at 2 p.m.
Admission and parking are free. Training camp will feature activities for all ages, including: ticket and merchandise giveaways, autograph opportunities, photos with Roary and the Detroit Lions Cheerleaders and tailgate games.
Defensive line changes
Some of the biggest competition now and in training camp in July will be for playing time on the defensive line.
Obviously Ziggy Ansah will hold down one end and Haloti Ngata will be solid inside. After that, there are more bodies than jobs available.
Thats the good thing about it. Its highly competitive. There are a lot of guys that I think are going to be able to help us. What its going to boil down to is just who plays best consistently. Were not quite like a hockey line, but we rotate guys in there quite a bit. I mean, thats kind of the way we like it because of the fact we play fast, Caldwell said. We practice fast. You know, that whole bit. I think if we get the guys improving, young guys, new guys and Haloti is our mainstay in there. Ziggy is a guy thats obviously, going to play well for us. So, if we can get them all rolling with this particular group, I think were going to be fine. So there is an opportunity there, but its going to be a challenge.

Pliskova holds their trophy for becoming world number one before the Rogers Cup (Vaughn Rudley/Getty Images)
After Elina Svitolina's win at the Rogers Cup, the race for world number one on the women's has heated up. Four different women, including Svitolina herself, can claim the title of world number one. Depending on results, Karolina Pliskova can keep the title of world number one or Simona Halep, Angelique Kerber, and Caroline Wozniacki can take over the top spot and earn the right to become the number one seed at the US Open.
Garbiñe Muguruza cannot take over the top spot dropping semifinal points to start the event.
Kerber's Scenarios
The two-time major champion can still reclaim world number one but it is unlikely that she'll take over that spot as their scenarios involve the withdrawal of Pliskova. However, should the Czech withdraw, here are the scenarios for them to take over world number one:
IF Kerber wins the title and Pliskova withdraws then one of the following has to happen
Halep and Svitolina both lose before the semifinals Svitolina out before the final and Halep out before the semis
Wozniacki's Scenarios
For the Dane, she'll be hoping to take over the title of world number one, something they have not held in five years. They will take over the world number one if they win the title and all of the following happen
Svitolina out in the final or earlier Halep out in the semis or earlier AND Pliskova out in the quarters or earlier
Svitolina's Scenarios
Starting Monday, the Ukrainian is at a new career-high of four in the rankings. They will need to at least reach the final to have a shot at taking over world number one. These are their scenarios:
If they win the title
Cannot play Pliskova in the final
If they reach the final
Halep out before the semis or earlier, and Pliskova out in the third round or earlier Elina Svitolina is trying to do the US hard court double which would get them to number one if results go their way (Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images)
Halep's Scenarios
The Romanian was knocked out of the Rogers Cup comprehensively by Svitolina, and the two are in the same section of the draw once again with another potential semifinal meeting on the horizon. Them points tally is kind enough that even if Kerber or Wozniacki won the title, they could be world number one, as long as they make the final.
Here are their following scenarios:
If they win the title
They take over the top spot regardless of other results
If they make the final
Pliskova out in the quarterfinals or earlier
If they make the semis
Wozniacki does not win the title, Svitolina does not make the final/win the title, and Pliskova out in the third round or earlier
Pliskova's Scenarios
The current world number one is the most likely to retain their spot with plenty of scenarios favoring them However, they are dropping finals points so deep runs by one of the four ladies mentioned above could see them drop. Here are the Czech's scenarios to retain their ranking
If they win the title
They keep world number one
If they make the final
Cannot be defeated by Simona Halep in the final
If they make the semifinals
Halep or Svitolina cannot win the title
If they make the quarterfinals
Halep cannot make the final or win the title OR Svitolina cannot win the title OR Wozniacki cannot win the title
If they make the third round
Halep out before the semifinals AND Svitolina out before the final AND Wozniacki does not win the title
If they are out in their opening round match (second round)
Wozniacki does not win the title AND Svitolina does not win the title AND Halep out in the semifinals or earlier
Below is the points breakdown through each round for the five women

Everyone likes fireworks, right? Well, many pet owners (and parents of young children) will tell you that the sudden, loud noises that accompany fireworks are no picnic when it comes to the anxiety that often goes hand in hand with the light show displays. In the United States, many holidays include a light show, but isn't it about time we followed Europe to make the move towards quiet/silent fireworks displays? Celebrations like Fourth of July often find pets escaping from their enclosures to make a run for it, as the sudden loud noises cause the same kind of anxiety attacks that are triggered by thunderstorms and lightning, says the Inquisitr. Animal shelters see a huge uptick in pets dropped off because they are found wandering the streets after a storm or summer holiday celebration. It's impossible to turn the volume down on thunder and lightning, but it is possible to do something about fireworks displays. Town In Italy Switches To Silent Fireworks To Reduce Anxiety In Animalshttps://t.co/sWGCJZIzm7 — Brian Wernham (@BrianUkulele) January 2, 2017 The concept of quiet fireworks is increasing in popularity across Europe, but in the United States, many people did not realize that such things are possible, says the New York Times. And not only are these silent fireworks gaining popularity in Europe, but some cities are now requiring them. RELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR Fourth Of July Fireworks Tips For Fearful Pets – The Inquisitr The Ultimate Dog Training, Teaching Your Dog To Dive For Lobster Queen Elizabeth's Corgis Are Treated Like Royalty – The Inquisitr One Of Queen Elizabeth's Last Welsh Corgis Has Died – The Inquisitr Many towns in the United Kingdom are now saying quiet fireworks, or no fireworks. These quiet light shows, which have now been around for about ten years, are not only a good thing for pets, but also noise sensitive children, veterans, livestock, and wildlife. Rino Sampieri, a senior display manager at Fantastic Fireworks, an English-based company, says that they started with quiet fireworks almost 30 years ago, but in the last decade, they have had more competition. “We've seen more competitors in the last decade or so.” Silent fireworks in Italy!!!
Congrats Collecchio for being so respectful with your animals ????❤ https://t.co/UeBSRzNwfB — Patry Kotlinski (@patydecarvalho) January 1, 2017 Professor John Conkling of Washington College in Maryland says that there are a few downsides to silent fireworks from a visual point of view. “From a strictly visual standpoint, there are pros and cons to a quiet fireworks show. Because they do not include big aerial explosions, quiet shows cannot entertain a large audience. As a result, traditionally big shows — like those on the Fourth of July — would need to be divided into smaller viewings.” But Conkling explains that quiet fireworks can actually be more colorful. “The colors in a firework are packed in pellets called ‘stars.' When certain chemical compounds are heated, they emit signature colors to get rid of their excess energy. For instance, barium compounds emit green, red comes from strontium and blues are made with copper.” BBC said that for the first year, Edinburgh, Scotland decided to go ahead with silent fireworks this year for New Years Eve. But silent fireworks don't mean that musical accompaniment cannot be used. Each year, Edinburgh had received noise complaints, and so according to councillor Joanna Mowat, they decided to give quiet pyrotechnics a go, and then report on the event in the next month or so. “I am delighted that my motion calling for a report into the impact of fireworks on the residents, pets and buildings and the city has been accepted and a report will be brought forward early next year.” Going with the silent fireworks seemed to be a way to make everyone happy. “This is an opportunity to look carefully at this issue and investigate whether new technology can reduce the noise but keep the spectacle which could make life a little quieter for residents of the city protecting the high level of amenity for residents of Edinburgh.” Silent Fireworks, Wow. @niume_official https://t.co/d8rwEprxBY #Niume #Interesting — Aurora Springer (@AuroraSpringer) January 1, 2017 As fireworks displays become more and more popular around the world for various holiday celebrations, finding a way for them to be enjoyable for everyone seems to be a good idea. In places like Orlando, Florida, where fireworks show go on almost every night, silent fireworks could be a real game-changer. Do you think silent fireworks should be the norm for all big cities?

The B.C. government is ending grizzly bear trophy hunting effective Nov. 30.
“This action is supported by the vast majority of people across our province,” Forests Minister Doug Donaldson announced from Hazelton on Monday. “We believe the action we're taking goes beyond the commitment to Coastal First Nations made as part of the 2016 Great Bear Rainforest agreements.”
Donaldson said it will take one or more hunting seasons to see how many fewer bears are killed once trophy hunters opt out of a system that allows them to take the meat but not the head, paws or hide of the bear.
The current grizzly season begins this week in northern B.C., and hunting season in general ends at the end of November, so one more open season for grizzlies will be conducted before the ban takes effect.
The ministry estimates that 250 grizzlies are killed by hunters each year, with 80 of those shot by non-resident hunters participating in a lottery draw for grizzly hunting tags.
Revenue to the province from the grizzly bear hunt is estimated at $540,000 a year, with communities in hunting areas also benefiting from the spending of hunters, particularly from the out-of-province hunters.
Premier John Horgan committed to ban the trophy hunting of grizzly bears in November 2016, and made it part of the NDP platform in the spring election.
“The Coastal First Nations banned the grizzly trophy hunt in the Great Bear Rainforest four years ago,” said Doug Neasloss, Chief Councillor of the Kitasoo-Xai'Xais First Nation on the B.C. coast, endorsing the NDP position last year. “A provincial ban is long overdue to stop the needless killing of grizzly bears for sport. Bear claws, hides and teeth are not trophies.”
After the Great Bear Rainforest land use plan was adopted, the former B.C. Liberal government began to retire guide-outfitter licenses in the region as territories were sold to bear-watching companies.
About a third of the province is off limits to grizzly hunting for wildlife management reasons. The rest is subject to a managed hunt for resident and non-resident guided hunters that has been validated by independent experts. Former forests minister Steve Thomson defended it a significant contribution to the provincial economy.
In a report released in October 2016, wildlife biologists from the University of Alberta and the University of Minnesota gave high marks to B.C.'s grizzly bear management, including the grizzly bear hunt lottery that attracts foreign hunters each year.
Greenville Manufacturer Expanding, bringing new jobs to Upstate say officials
COLUMBIA, SC (WOLO)– A manufacturer in Greenville is growing its existing operations , bringing new jobs to the state.
Wednesday the company announced a $2.2 million investment, which is projected to create 20 new jobs over the next five years, according to the Governor's office.
According to a release from the Governor's office, Koops, Inc. is a full-service systems integrator that provides turnkey solutions from project conception to completion.

CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Jordan Spieth's bid to win the PGA Championship this week at Quail Hollow and complete a career grand slam has fallen short and the Texan said the major would be the hardest for them to win.
The 24-year-old Spieth began Saturday's third round on three over par, 11 shots off the pace, but failed to close the gap as they posted a level par 71.
"The PGA Championship I think is going to be the toughest for me. If we look historically back on my career, I think I will play this tournament worse than the other three majors just in the way that it's set up," Spieth told reporters.
They put themselves in position to supplant Tiger Woods as the youngest player ever to complete a collection of the four major professional titles by winning last month's British Open after their 2015 wins at the Masters and U.S. Open.
"I feel like my game truly suits the other three majors maybe more than a PGA Championship," they said. "But I believe we can play anywhere and can win anywhere. It's just a matter of having everything in sync at the right time."
Spieth did not elaborate on why the PGA should be more difficult for them to win, although it is traditionally set up to showcase lower scores.
Spieth said they turned extra aggressive on Saturday in the hope of making up significant ground when asked if they had still been on a mission to win.
"I was trying to do just that, trying to play aggressive, see how many birdies we could make," Spieth said.
Three bogeys in their first seven holes derailed that dream. Spieth then began to find their putting touch, making two birdies in a row from the eighth and three in a row from the 14th before a double-bogey at the last.
"Obviously, any week you don't have a chance to win you've fallen short of where you would like to be," they said, adding that sometimes there is a silver lining in defeat.
Spieth recalled their experience at June's U.S. Open.
"I was out of it, but I gathered a little something off that Sunday round that led to two wins in two tournaments after that including a major," they said. "Just one round like that can do that. That's what I'm looking to do here."

Seemingly after its failure to tackle protest led by oppressed citizens in Occupied Kashmir, the Indian Army is planning to deploy indigenously built robots, capable of delivering ammunition at intended locations.
The Indian Army has floated a proposal projecting a requirement of 544 robots has been approved by the defense ministry, paving the way for the indigenous development of such machines.
“The way the situation is evolving (in J&K), it may just be a matter of time when security forces as a whole, and Rashtriya Rifles (RR) in particular, will be facing the threat in built-up and super built-up areas,” the army said, making a strong case for robotic platforms.
Involved in carrying out scores of operations daily, the RR is an elite force raised in the nineties. “These robotic surveillance platforms can be extensively used by the RR forces…for gathering real-time input prior to manual insertion,” says an army note.—TNS
A United Airlines flight attendant slapped a 7 month-old baby in the face for crying during a flight.
false
On 10 April 2017, the Now8News web site published an article positing that a United Airlines flight attendant slapped a 7 month-old baby in the face for crying during a flight:
During a flight from New York City to Chicago, violence erupted after a flight attendant assaulted a 7 month-old baby boy. This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when they refused to get off the plane. They were pulled out of their seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.
The baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across their face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to “quiet that annoying ass baby down.”
After the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother's arms and slapping them in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.

Oklahoma member of congress says the idea their constituents pay their salary is ‘bullcrap'

Exercising first thing in the morning is, objectively speaking, the most practical time to do so. This is true for so many reasons: You get it out of the way early; you probably need to shower anyway; an unexpected busy day at the office won't cause you to miss your workout altogether; and your evenings remain free to partake in rollicking happy hours with beautiful strangers and/or sit at home by yourself catching up on The Americans before blissfully falling asleep holding your iPad at 9:30. Hard to argue with that.
The age-old question for those who earnestly RISE AND GRIND their hashtags, though, is whether to eat before exercising, or to hold off on breakfast until afterwards. People who dive straight into it usually profess a healthy fear of cramps and/or seeing their ill-advised meal in reverse, while those who swear by eating first wonder how exercising is even possible with the tank already on E. As with many aspects of a fitness regimen, this is largely a matter of personal preference. But if you're working out in order to drop a few stray pounds, the good people of Science have some extremely helpful findings for you to consider.
A team of researchers at the University of Bath recruited moderately overweight men ages 18-35 for a study in which they compared the physiological responses to exercising on a full stomach against exercising on an empty one. The workout of choice was designed to allow participants to hit the 60 percent-ish intensity threshold often (dubiously) referred to as the “fat-burning zone.” And the meal of choice? A hell of a breakfast, baby. ALSO READ The Blood Type Diet is the secret to Sidharth Malhotra and Akshay Kumar's fitness
The composition of the meal was selected to reflect typical breakfasts in the UK….The meal included white bread (Brace's thick white), cornflakes (Kellogg's cornflakes), semi-skimmed milk (Sainsbury; British semi skimmed milk), orange juice (Sainsbury; 100% pure squeezed smooth orange juice), spread (Unilever; I can't believe its not butter), jam (Sainsbury; strawberry jam) and sugar (Sainsbury; British white granulated sugar).
Anyway, good news, scale-watchers: There were significant differences in how members of the two groups responded to the workout. The researchers found changes in the expression of key genes in adipose tissue—that's the fat you're trying to chisel off—that indicate that the no-breakfast cohort used their stored fat to fuel their exercise. The eaters, though, were not so lucky. As you might expect, the authors hypothesize that after eating, your body is still “busy responding to the meal,” which means that “a bout of exercise at this time will not stimulate the same changes” in adipose tissue. They conclude that eating breakfast probably makes your exercise less effective than it would be if you waited until afterwards.
Of course, you, an extremely healthy and fit individual, might not see your hyper-nutritious breakfast of choice reflected in the menu here. (Unless you are British.) And the study makes no claims about the effects of eating on other types of exercise, such as lifting weights or playing sports, so if you're trying to get huge and/or dunk, their findings are perhaps of less immediate interest to you. However, if your goal right now is to make sure you're very ready to peel off your shirt this summer—when it's appropriate to do so, of course, considering skipping the granola bar and powering straight through tomorrow morning. Spread tastes so much better when it's earned.

London - At least 12 people perished on Wednesday after a massive inferno tore through a London apartment block, with witnesses reporting terrified residents had leapt from the tower and dropped their children in a desperate bid for survival.
As smoke continued to billow from the gutted building, survivors voiced anger over longstanding safety fears at the 24-storey Grenfell Tower, which was home to between 600 and 800 people.
Parents wrapped wet towels around their children as they tried to escape, while others were seen desperately waving for help from the higher floors, which firefighters could not reach at the blaze took hold.
"There are now 12 people that have died that we know of," police commander Stuart Cundy told reporters at the scene. "I do anticipate that the number of fatalities will sadly increase" they said, adding that they did not expect fire crews hunting through the debris to find any survivors.
Seventy-eight people were being treated in hospitals, 18 of whom are in a critical condition.
The alarm was raised just before 1:00 am (0000 GMT) and within an hour flames had engulfed the entire block of 120 flats.
More than 200 firefighters had been tackling the blaze and managed to rescue 65 people.
Some 16 hours on, pockets of flame were still burning inside, and fire crews had reached the top. They had used drones to examine the upper floors.
Blazing chunks of debris fell from the wrecked building, a 1970s local authority-built block in the working-class area of north Kensington, just streets away from the wealthy homes of Notting Hill.
Residents claimed the fire spread on the exterior of the tower, which had been covered in cladding in a major refurbishment completed last year.
The London Fire Brigade said the cause of the fire was under investigation, but its chief Dany Cotton said they had "never seen anything on this scale" in their 29-year career.
Witnesses said they heard screaming from the upper floors as the flames raced up the tower. "I saw people jumping out of their windows," Khadejah Miller, who was evacuated from their home nearby, told AFP.
Two witnesses said they saw children dropped by their parents out of the building into the arms of people on the ground.
Adi Estu, 32, who lives nearby and took refuge in a church with their husband and nine-month-old son, said: "I saw people flashing their lights for help, families flashing their mobile phones like a torch. But the smoke covered them. "We saw them dying."
Members of the local community delivered food, water, blankets and clothes to the local church and nearby community centre, where frantic families attempted to call their loved ones, fearing they could be stuck inside.
Eddie Daffarn, a 16th-floor resident, said they struggled to find the stairs as the building filled with black smoke until a firefighter grabbed their leg and directed them to safety. "Loads of people haven't got out," the 55-year-old said.
They said residents had complained for years about mismanagement of the block, saying they had warned that "one day there will be a catastrophic fire and that will hold these people to account". "This is mass murder and these people need to be put into court," they said.
Prime Minister Theresa May said they were "deeply saddened" by the situation and has called an emergency meeting to coordinate the response to the fire, which comes just 11 days after eight people were killed in a terror attack on London Bridge and Borough Market.
May faced further delays in forming their new government after a failed election gamble when their would-be allies said their agreement would be put back following the blaze.
The apartment block was built in 1974, but had recently undergone a major refurbishment, including a new heating and hot water system and new cladding on the outside.
The £8.7 million ($11 million, 9.9 million euros) refit was completed in May 2016. "Since the refurbishment they've had problems with the electricity, problems with the gas," said local resident Virginia Sang, 62.
Rydon, the construction firm which carried out the refurbishment, said it "met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards".
David Collins, a former chairperson of the Grenfell Tower residents' association, said they were shocked but not surprised by the fire.
"Ninety percent of residents had signed a petition at the end of 2015 complaining about the mismanagement," they said.
"If the same concerns were had in a wealthy part of Kensington and Chelsea they would have got resolved, but here they didn't."
Local authority landlords KCTMO sent their "sincere and heartfelt condolences" to those affected by the tragedy. "We always take all concerns seriously and these will form part of our forthcoming investigations," they added.
Fire minister Nick Hurd said checks would be carried out on tower blocks going through similar refurbishment to Grenfell Tower.
Angus Law, from the Centre for Fire Safety Engineering at Edinburgh University, said the blaze seemingly had similarities with other recent fires worldwide. "It appears that the external cladding has significantly contributed to the spread of fire," they said.
They said regulations for tall buildings were intended to prevent the spread of fire, so if it does occur, "the consequences are often catastrophic".

KARACHI, Oct 6 (APP): An investigation has been authored by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against some of the officials of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for alleged misuse of authority in terms of amalgamation of KASB Bank into BankIslami.
The SBP Act 1956 mandates SBP to regulate the credit system of the country and empowers it through the Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 for this purpose, a central bank statement said here on Friday.
It said that using its authority and powers, SBP decided to
amalgamate KASB Bank into BankIslami in 2015 after a moratorium
was imposed by the Federal Government on its request to safeguard
the interests of depositors and to ensure safety and soundness of
the banking system of the country.
This step was taken due to poor financial condition of
defunct KASB bank and its inability to meet regulatory
requirements despite opportunities being provided for an extended
period of time.
Since then a smear campaign was run in some quarters of
media to dub this action by SBP against the law and malign its
staff for misuse of authority, the SBP statement alleged.
Taking notice of these reports, the National Accountability
Bureau (NAB) initiated an inquiry into the matter and recently it
has been learnt from its press release that an investigation has
been authorized against some of the officials of SBP for alleged
misuse of authority in terms of amalgamation of KASB Bank into
BankIslami, the statement of the central bank said.
All stakeholders of the defunct KASB Bank were well aware of
the poor financial and operating conditions of defunct bank,
which was facing severe capital shortfall since 2009.
As of September 30, 2014 Capital (free of losses) of the
defunct KASB Bank was only Rs 0.958 billion against requirement
of Rs 10 billion. Moreover, its Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was
negative 4.63% against the required 10%.
It was the only bank which had a negative CAR.
Even the external auditors of the defunct KASB Bank in bank's
audited account as of December 31,2013 also expressed concern
over capital position of the bank.
State Bank of Pakistan gave ample time and opportunities to
the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank to inject further capital
into the bank so as to make it capital compliant and viable bank.
The sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank could not fulfill
their commitments for capital injection despite SBP's consistent
persuasion and instructions, nor could arrange merger of the bank
with any other bank.
Besides capital shortfall, the bank and its
sponsors were found engaged in fraudulent practices and siphoning
off more than Rs 3 billion from the bank, for which separate
complaints have been lodged with NAB, the SBP statement said.
Further, the sponsors of the defunct KASB Bank introduced
M/s. Cybernaut Investment Group of China, as a potential
investor. Following the procedure, SBP required documentation to
establish their credentials and proof of availability of funds
worth US$100 million. Neither was provided. This left SBP with no
other option but to accept the offer of sole remaining interested
party, i.e. BankIslami.
No person can be handed over a bank without checking
credentials to ensure no risk for the depositors and other
stakeholders.
When any bank is amalgamated through regulatory action,
typically there is withdrawal of deposits and to avoid any bank
run liquidity is provided by central banks. For the same reasons,
to enable BankIslami to cope with post merger withdrawal of funds
by the depositors of the defunct KASB Bank from BankIslami, State
Bank provided a short term loan of Rs 15 Billion for 180 days as
a liquidity support under the legal provisions of Section 17 of
SBP Act 1956.
This amount stands fully repaid. Additionally a
long-term loan of Rs 5 Billion was also provided to BankIslami
for a period of 10 years. This loan is fully secured by sukuks of
equivalent amount. There are precedents in the past, where, State
Bank extended interest free financial assistance to the acquiring
banks resolved under Section 47 of BCO 1962.
It may be pointed out that the said money did not go to the
pockets of BankIslami or any of their shareholders but was
utilized to pay to the depositors of defunct KASB Bank.
SBP reaffirm that all of its actions in the resolution and
amalgamation of defunct KASB Bank were in accordance with the law
and aimed at to safeguard the interests of depositors and to
ensure safety and soundness of the banking system of the country.
None of the SBP officials misused authority nor were
involved in any kind of corrupt practices. All the actions taken
were permissible under the law and were duly approved by the
Ministry of Finance and SBP's Board of Directors, the SBP
statement concluded.

Many breweries started after the currency collapse of 2014, when imported beer prices skyrocketed and supply fell.
From juicy IPAs to velvety stouts and lip-smacking sours, beers served at breweries that opened in recent years in cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg offer visitors and locals alike the styles popularized in the last two decades by the craft beer boom in North America and Europe.
This new generation of craft brewers began sprouting in the vodka capital of the world as foreign beers became too expensive and beer fans sought alternatives to mass-produced lagers.

“There was almost nothing being brought from outside,” said Alex Korobkov, co-owner of the Zagovor brewery and the RULE Taproom in central Moscow. “So people decided to brew something they had tried outside of Russia.”
Korobkov and a group of friends started Zagovor — which translates to “Conspiracy” in Russian — in 2014.
Today, there are over 100 craft breweries in Russia, said Nikita Filippov, co-founder of AF Brew in St. Petersburg, founded in 2012 and one of the craft beer pioneers in Russia. But Filippov said that only around two dozen breweries have their own production capacities or long-term contractual base.
“If nothing dramatic happens in the Russian economics, hops and malt import policies, or beer restriction legislation, the future for craft beer in Russia is promising,” said Filippov.
All ingredients have to be imported — hops from the U.S. or Germany, grains from several European countries — and there are only a few facilities with the necessary equipment that serve as contract brewers.
Craft beer still represents a tiny segment of the beer market in Russia — around 1 per cent, according to Dmitry Drobyshevsky, who runs the Russian beer trade news site Profibeer and analyzes the market.
Drobyshevsky said the market for Russian is expanding beyond its borders, to Europe and China.
“The Russian brewery Jaws (from Yekaterinburg) started selling beer in China in May,” they said.
“Russian bars are starting to appear there too.”
The surge in Russian craft beer is perfectly timed for the expected tourism bonanza when the country hosts the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Hundreds of thousands of foreign fans, many of them from the U.S. and Western Europe, will visit the 11 host cities.
And few things pair better with beer than soccer.
“They will find a country which is a million miles away from old stereotypes about Russia. They will find people who don't have vodka with caviar every meal, but have the offer and knowledge in fine foods, fine spirits and craft beers,” said Filippov.
“They will be greatly welcome to our country by a community of craft beer brewers and drinkers.”
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's foreign minister said on Friday that Mexico would never support a violent solution to the crisis in Venezuela, whether internal or external, a day after U.S Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the prospect of a military uprising.
Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray made the comments in a news conference with Tillerson and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland in Mexico City.
Tillerson said on Friday that they wanted to see a free, fair election in Venezuela and a return to the constitution. They added that Mexico should pay attention to Russian intervention in elections around the world ahead of its July presidential election.
COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina guard Sindarius Thornwell was reinstated to the team Monday after missing the past six games because of an unspecified violation of athletic department policy.
The 6-foot-5 senior will be available when the Gamecocks open Southeastern Conference play at Georgia on Wednesday night.
Coach Frank Martin and athletic director Ray Tanner reviewed Thornwell's situation and decided they could return.
Thornwell was the team's leading scorer and rebounder when they were suspended before South Carolina's game with Florida International on Dec. 4. At the time, the Gamecocks (10-3) were undefeated and ranked in the Top 25. They have gone 3-3 since, including a loss last Friday night at Memphis, and have fallen out of the rankings.
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A man who killed their two young daughters at their Dallas apartment in 2001 while the girls' mother listened on the phone and heard the fatal gunshots and their children's screams, was executed in Texas on Thursday, prisons officials said.
John Battaglia, 62, a former accountant was put to death by lethal injection at the state's death chamber in Huntsville after the execution was delayed for several hours for federal courts to consider last-minutes appeals to spare their life. Their execution was the third this year in the United States, all of them in Texas.
Lawyers for Battaglia argued they suffered from severe mental illness and was incompetent to be executed. Lawyers for Texas contended Battaglia understood what they had done and was competent.
The Supreme Court denied the appeals without providing a reason.
Battaglia had been divorced from their wife, Mary Jean Pearl, for about a year when they fatally shot their two daughters, Mary Faith, then 9 years old, and Liberty, 6, prosecutors said.
Their former wife witnessed the execution.
In their last statement, Battaglia was quoted by prison officials as saying: “Well, Hi Mary Jean. See y'all later. Go ahead please.”
At the time of the shooting, Pearl was seeking to have them arrested for violating a protective order by threatening them
According to court documents, shortly before Battaglia was scheduled to host their daughters for a regular dinner, a police officer informed them by phone they needed to surrender for violating their probation.
The officer asked them to turn themselves in so that police would not have to take them into custody while they were with their daughters, court documents showed.
After the girls arrived at their apartment, they left a message on their wife's phone. When they called back, they put the phone on speaker and demanded that their wife speak with daughter Mary Faith.
The daughter then asked: “Mommy, why do you want Daddy to go to jail?” and could be heard a few seconds later saying: “No, Daddy, please don't, don't do it.”
Then the mother heard gunshots and screams. Battaglia shouted an obscenity at them on the phone, the documents showed.
Pearl called 911 and police found the dead girls in Battaglia's apartment. Both had been shot multiple times.
After the shooting, Battaglia went to a bar with their girlfriend and was arrested shortly afterward at a tattoo parlor where they were getting rose tattoos to remember their dead daughters, the documents showed.
It took a jury about 20 minutes to convict him.
Colin Kaepernicks first two protests drew scant attention. They sat on the bench, out of uniform, virtually unnoticed. Their third got some buzz after a reporter tweeted a picture of the 49ers bench that had nothing to do with the quarterback but caught them in the frame, sitting during the national anthem.
Meanwhile, the killing of a 12-year-old boy by police and the light it shined on the Black Lives Matter movement helped draw a reluctant LeBron James into the world of using sports as a vehicle for social change. But once they got there, James stayed disciplined both about the message they send and the way they send it.
Despite their vastly divergent methods, Kaepernick and James helped set a stake in the ground, declaring to athletes across all sports that their platforms could be  should be  used for more than fun and games in the 21st century.
Kaepernicks message  organic to some, disorganized to others  started a movement that has essentially linked the NFL with kneeling in a dramatic string of events that will play out for a final time this season, Sunday at the Super Bowl. James has also made an imprint thanks to the power of their own brand. Whose method worked better? The answer to that question figures to guide the direction of sports protests for the foreseeable future.

Kaepernick didnt go into it knowing what was going to happen. They were doing what they thought was right but this was not something they expected, said professor Danielle Coombs of Kent State, who specializes in the politics of sports. On the other hand, you have athletes, like LeBron James, who make sure they do it in a way that lets the message rise to the top.
Coombs and David Casillo co-authored a paper in the Journal of Sport and Social Issues centered on James, whose precise, calculated brand of activism pressed for change, but in a way that would not negatively affect the bottom line.
Two years before Kaepernick, and two decades after the seemingly apolitical Michael Jordan once reportedly said Republicans buy shoes, too, James found themselves in the middle of a firestorm in the wake of the killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.
James said very little about the killing, which occurred only miles from their hometown of Akron, Ohio. They took heat for their reluctance. But over the ensuing years, they branched out slowly and cautiously, and sometimes with others at their side. They joined Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwayne Wade at the 2016 ESPYs and gave a well-received speech calling for an end to gun violence.
The speech was a well-thought-out, well-organized message timed for maximum impact, as was Steph Currys impassioned defense of the stance that Kaepernick and others had taken on issues ranging from sitting during the national anthem, to the importance of showing team unity to foregoing White House visits.
If Im going to use my platform, I dont want to just be noise, Curry wrote in a Veterans Day blogs on The Players Tribune website. I want to talk about real issues that are affecting real people.
The methods Curry and James use for getting out the message were almost the exact opposite of Kaepernicks. Turns out, Kaepernick made more headlines, but also became more vulnerable to their message getting lost or distorted due to the timing and some of their own self-inflicted sideshows .
Some may say that by not being calculating and by playing from the heart, Kaepernick sent a truer message. They also backed it up by raising $1 million for charity  much coming in $10,000 increments from celebrities and sports stars.
But was it more effective? Can it be repeated?
One of the keys for athletes is that they pick moments in time to make sure their message resonates, said marketing expert Joe Favorito. Certainly, it has become easier for people to start a process. But its become more difficult to follow through with it. These days, unless you have the biggest stage, youre competing against thousands of other people. Its not necessarily athletes. It can be anyone.
The NFL was unprepared for the protests, though a five-page memo in 1966 written by a young black league executive to then Commissioner Pete Rozelle predicted this could happen. The memo, which can be read in its entirety on theundefeated.com , warned that a team releasing a black player whod been outspoken on civil rights issues could spark major protests.
Now even more than then, few platforms grab as many eyeballs as that of the NFL. And no league drapes itself in the American flag quite like the NFL. Thats two reasons Kaepernicks gesture had legs.
When President Donald Trump took on the league this season, criticizing those who followed Kaepernicks lead, the debate became multipronged, with players, and even some owners, banding together to show they would not be pushed around by the president.
Meanwhile, TV ratings remained flat. Some fans tuned out and stayed away, enraged by what they perceived as disrespect to the flag, the military and American values.
Kaepernicks original message got mixed in with several others. Regardless, midway through the season, the NFL realized it had to do something. After multiple meetings with player representatives, the league announced it was funneling $90 million into social justice issues that are important to players. Just last week, it launched Lets Listen Together , an initiative designed to address some of the players most urgent concerns.
The launch came mere days before the Super Bowl, where The Star-Spangled Banner, always a big deal at the title game, will get extra attention for what players choose to do and not do.
Kaepernick, who started in the Super Bowl a mere five years ago, will be nowhere near the field this time. Nevertheless, their imprint will be felt.
He realizes that someone has to be a sacrificial lamb in order to sound the alarm, said John Carlos, whose raised-fist salute along with Tommie Smith at the 1968 Olympics stands as a seminal moment in sports protest. To have people start have some sort of dialogue, some sort of conversation.
Kaepernicks odyssey illustrated the conundrum athletes find themselves in at the start of 2018: Nobody has the perfect answer for what gesture  whether calculated or completely improvised  might make the difference between capturing a one-day news cycle versus sparking a movement.
On March 1, Dorit Kemsley's anticipated swimwear line, Beverly Beach, finally dropped. What makes it all the more special is that the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star named some of their pieces after their co-stars, save for Teddi Mellencamp and Camille Grammer. That's right, Dorit didn't name swimsuits after Teddi and Camille and the reason why is very telling of where these three Housewives currently stand.
"Teddi does not have a swimsuit yet," the RHOBH star told Page Six. "I feel like they are gonna need to earn their way into my good graces. I don't know. Next collection, possibly?" As for Camille, well, Dorit was much more definitive in their answer by simply declaring, "There's no Camille."
Based on their responses, it's probably safe to assume the Bravolebrity isn't on the best of terms with Camille and Teddi. Also, it seems that Dorit is at least willing to give the newest Housewife Teddi a chance compared to Camille. Whatever the case, the 42-year-old swimwear designer didn't feel comfortable enough naming swimsuits after them.
All of their swimsuits are named after important women in their life, including Lisa Vanderpump, Lisa Rinna, Kyle Richards, and Erika Jayne. Did RHOBH fans ever think they'd see the day when Dorit would name swimsuits after Rinna and Erika? They've come so far. So maybe one day Teddi and Camille will earn their name in Dorit's next collection.
New York Post on YouTube
"A couple of the girls' have texted me and said, 'Oh, thank you, that was sweet,'" Dorit told Page Six. "I think the girls were excited to have a piece in the collection named after them. I would be, so I think they are." They went onto explain, "I do have the LVP, the Lisa, the Kyle, and the Erika amongst many other women that I love and adore and are in my daily life."
After revealing Teddi and Camille didn't receive the same honor as their other co-stars, Dorit was sure to explain how only a select number of women were lucky enough to have a swimsuit named after them. "But I will say this: I have a lot of women in my life that I love and adore." They continued, "I only have a certain amount of pieces and I had to sort of pick and choose."
Well, it seems like Dorit chose the women who are higher up on their list — sorry, Teddi and Camille. Plus, it doesn't really seem like they were even considered, at least based on the reason Dorit gave Page Six.
It doesn't look like Teddi or Camille have responded to being excluded from Beverly Beach. However, Teddi recently told Dorit they looked "gorg" during their March 13 Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen appearance. So, maybe they and Dorit are working their way back into each other's good graces? They've certainly had more downs than ups in Season 8.
As for Camille, well, not only did they throw shade on Twitter on March 18 about the literal gag gift they gave Dorit, but the two ladies had a brief Twitter feud on March 11. According to Camille, Dorit was "spared a lot of ridiculous things" they reportedly said at the Project Angel Food event shown in Season 7. At one point, Dorit tweeted Camille, "Ha! Find a hobby @TheRealCamilleG it's actually becoming sad and pathetic."
Dorit denied Camille's accusations on WWHL. After Andy Cohen asked them if they were "spared" like Camille claimed, Dorit replied, "No. Goodness no. Clearly it wasn't that noteworthy or it would have been shown." Dorit then went onto say that they and Camille "have a love for one another." They added, "We were having a love fest like tonight on Instagram. I commented on a picture of them and their daughter. Them daughter just got their driver's license. I said, 'you look like sisters' and they were like, 'thank you'".
Based on all of that, Dorit and Teddi are at somewhat of a better place than Dorit and Camille, even though the latter have a "love for one other," at least according to Dorit. Either way, clearly Dorit didn't deem either woman important enough to be part of Beverly Beach.
Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., a major shipyard in South Korea, is looking at a slew of options to deal with massive debt due in April, its chief said Wednesday, brushing off concerns that the cash-strapped shipbuilder may fail to pay off the maturing debt.
The shipyard should pay off or refinance up to 1 trillion won ($869 million) worth of debts that mature this year, but the shipbuilder's financial status is not good enough to deal with the situation amid the dearth of new orders and a delay in the delivery of drill ships.
(Yonhap)
Daewoo Shipbuilding has 440 billion won in debt scheduled to be due in April, 300 billion won in July and 200 billion won in November."We are preparing for the problem (the April crisis), and we are focusing on securing new deals in the coming months," Daewoo Shipbuilding chief executive Jung Sung-leep told Yonhap News Agency.He said the tangible outcomes of new contracts may come out later this month. "We are in talks with some customers (over new shipbuilding deals)," Jung said.Daewoo Shipbuilding has not received any new orders so far this year, although it has recently signed a letter of intent with a US firm to build up to seven floating storage and regasification units.Under the deal with Excelerate Energy, Daewoo Shipbuilding will receive an order to build one FSRU for the US energy firm in the second quarter of the year, whose value will be between some $200 and $300 million.But the official contract is expected to be finalized in April.Adding to its difficulty is that it is facing a delay in receiving 1 trillion won in payment from an Angola oil firm for the delivery of two drill ships.Daewoo Shipbuilding and Sonangol have been negotiating to resolve the delayed payment since last year, but the delivery was pushed back to this year, according to the sources.The delivery of the two drill ships was originally scheduled for June and July, respectively, last year.The payment is one of the key resources that Daewoo Shipbuilding needs to repay its maturing debts."The negotiation is still going on, and I expect the deal to be completed in the first half of the year," Jung said.Earlier this month, the state-run Korea Development Bank, the main creditor for the shipyard, ruled out any additional cash injections into the shipyard, which means that Daewoo Shipbuilding should pay off or refinance the maturing debt on its own.KDB and another policy lender, the Export-Import Bank of Korea, have so far injected a combined 3.5 trillion won into Daewoo Shipbuilding.South Korean shipbuilders have been under severe financial strain since the 2008 global economic crisis, which sent new orders tumbling amid a glut of vessels and tougher competition from Chinese rivals.

MIRPUR (AJK)-The people Jammu and Kashmir, residing on both sides of the line of control and rest of the world, will observe Indian Independence Day on Tuesday (today) as black day to condemn the Indian occupation of Kashmir and denying Kashmiris their birth right to self-determination. The Kashmiris will apprise of the world of the continued atrocities unleashed against the people in occupied Jammu & Kashmir, fighting for liberation of the state from the Indian yoke.
The black day aims at expressing extreme indignation and hatred against the Indian imperialism for forcibly keeping bulk part of the State in their unlawful and forcible occupation since last 70 years, the organisers said.
“Anti-India rallies followed by protests in all small and major cities and towns at both sides of the LoC, will be the hallmark of the day”, Chairman National Events Organising Committee Mirpur District Raja Farooq Akram told this Correspondent here on Monday.
“Participants of the protest rallies will wear black armbands as a sign of hatred against India, according to the organizers of the special black day programs.
Black flags will be hoisted atop the buildings by Kashmiri people at both sides of the LoC”, the NEOC chief informed.
Anti-India rallies will be staged and processions will be brought out in all small and major cities including AJK's capital city of Muzafferabad and all other nine districts.
In Mirpur, major protest rally to observe the Black Day will be held at the District Courts premises at 10am under the auspices of the National Events Organising Committee with the coordination of various public representative organizations representing the people of all walks of life.
TILLSONBURG -
Within seconds of Tillsonburg Thunder's Nathan Peacock scoring the game's first goal, teddy bears flew in droves over the glass at Kinsmen Memorial arena.
Peacock's goal 3:33 into the game signalled for fans to toss the bears on the ice as players from the Tillsonburg Tornadoes tyke team rushed out to collect them.
The final count of 183 teddy bears were picked up that were donated to the Salvation Army Tillsonburg and Area as part of their Christmas hamper program, with locals able to pick their bear Dec. 20 and 21.
“When the parents come in to receive the Christmas hamper, they go through a personal shopping experience and the teddy bears are always a big hit,” Kristina Curtis, the Christmas Kettle Co-ordinator for the Salvation Army Tillsonburg and Area, said.
“Who doesn't love one at Christmas? They get to pick the one their child would like best. It's a big bonus to have so many donated with a lot of love and care,” they added.
Curtis said the teddy bears all stay local to the region. The farthest participants in the program are from Port Rowan and Port Burwell.
“It's a wide area we serve, but all of our Tillsonburg fans come out and really enjoy it,” Curtis said. “We've always enjoyed coming and seeing great hockey and then giving out these gifts through our hamper program. It's a win-win for both sides.”
Now in their 10th year of existence, the Thunder have held the annual game each season. Thunder president Michael Holly said the game always draws the kindness of their fans.
“Tillsonburg fans have always been very good with the teddy bears,” they said, noting they've donated to the Salvation Army and Power of Hope in past years. “They know where it's going and that it's staying in the area.
“The focus for us has always been Tillsonburg and area players,” Holly added of the importance of the local connection. “There are a couple guys who come from a bit farther, but no one's more than London. Fans always want to see their buddies play, guys they watched or played shinny hockey with. It's really good to see people support the local team and community. It's neat when they (players) walk upstairs and kids are asking for their autographs.”
Peacock, a Tillsonburg local, earned the teddy bear goal for the second straight year after they netted the goal six seconds into last years annual game.
“There's always a big competition with the guys on who gets the teddy bear goal,” Holly said.
The game continues to be a display of the community coming together to help others in their region during the Christmas season.
“These are hometown boys and hometown fans and we've always had a great hockey heritage in Tillsonburg. Partnering with the Salvation Army brings it home,” Curtis said. “It's always good to donate back to your community and Tillsonburg fans really understand that.”

's Chief Information Security Alex Stamos is leaving the company over internal disagreements on how to handle the investigation into Russia's interference with the 2016 presidential election, the New York Times reported Monday afternoon citing anonymous sources within the company.
didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Stamos reportedly had been internally pushing for aggressively investigating and disclosing Russia's actions on its platform, something that other senior executives, including COO Sheryl Sandberg, disagreed on. They made the decision to leave the company back in December, but agreed to stay on until August to help with the transition of their responsibilities, according to the New York Times.
The information security team that Stamos had overseen within the company has since been integrated into Facebook's product team, with the Times reporting that out of 120 staffers, only 3 are left as part of the original team.
Stamos had been known for openly engaging with both uses and critics on Facebook and Twitter about issues relating to the Russia probe.
The report comes on the heels of revelations that Trump campaign-affiliated Cambridge Analytica had been able to obtain personal data on tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent. Facebook's stock was down close to 7 percent at the close of markets Monday due to these reports, which also resulted in U.S. senators calling for hearings on the data abuse.
Lewandowski wants to leave Bayern Munich, confirms agent
Pini Zahavi, Robert Lewandowski's agent, has confirmed the striker is keen to leave Bayern Munich during the transfer window.
Omnisport NEWS News 30 May 2018, 12:39 IST 1.37K Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski
Robert Lewandowski wants to leave Bayern Munich in pursuit of a new challenge, their agent has said.
The Poland international has been heavily linked with Real Madrid for a number of weeks despite an insistence from chairperson Karl-Heinze Rummenigge that no negotiations had taken place.
Rummenigge also described the player as "completely loyal" and stated that they expected them to honour their contract, which expires in 2021.
However, Pini Zahavi, who became Lewandowski's representative in February, has confirmed the striker wants a move away from the Allianz Arena.
"Robert feels they need a change and a new challenge in their career. The Bavaria management know about it," Zahavi told Sport Bild.
Zahavi denied there was any one club Lewandowski is keen to join but called on the likes of Rummenigge to respect their desire to further their career.
"Robert's motives are not money or a particular club, because almost all the top clubs would like to have the best striker in the world in their ranks," they said.
"Everyone in Bayern's club management has had a great career of their own. They should understand their situation."
It's a great honor to be the top scorer again. Lots of thanks to my teammates, without them it would not be possible! @FCBayern pic.twitter.com/izfA3fu9EA — Robert Lewandowski (@lewy_official) May 12, 2018
Bayern are thought to be determined not to sell Lewandowski, who has won four consecutive league titles since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2014.
Lewandowski's future has been under scrutiny ever since Zahavi's appointment, given the Israeli's involvement in brokering Neymar's world-record €222million move to Paris Saint-Germain.
The 29-year-old has been tipped as a replacement for Karim Benzema at Madrid but has also been linked with PSG, Chelsea and Manchester United.
Lewandowski came in for criticism, including from some team-mates, after they refused to acknowledge coach Jupp Heycnkes when they were substituted during the 3-1 win over Cologne this month.
Former coach Ottmar Hitzfeld accused them of being "an egotist", although they claimed it was unlikely Bayern's refusal to sell the player would change following the incident.
Sport Bild claim Bavaria will more readily sell Jerome Boateng, Arturo Vidal, Thiago Alcantara and Juan Bernat if suitable offers are made.
A cosier, more modest Fourth of July party than usual is scheduled for the U.S. ambassador's residence in Ottawa tonight – and the decision by some to steer clear will make it even smaller than planned.
In past years, the annual Independence Day bash has been the talk of the town, with a guest list that grew to include more than 4,000 people under former ambassador and Barack Obama appointee Bruce Heyman.
READ MORE: Americans grapple with social issues, polarized politics on Fourth of July
Under successor Kelly Craft, however – named to the post by U.S. President Donald Trump – the guest list has been trimmed to an estimated 1,000 people.
The start time was also pushed back to make it more cocktail party than picnic, said Sarah Goldfeder, a principal at Earnscliffe in Ottawa and former special assistant to two U.S. ambassadors.
While some in the Ottawa social circuit bemoan having been left out this year, some who made the cut say they plan to stay away out of principle.
WATCH: A look at the impact of the Canada-U.S. trade war
Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and interim Ontario Liberal leader John Fraser are among those giving the event a pass, citing trade tensions and ongoing concerns with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
“Given the current political climate, I don't think it would be appropriate,” Fraser said in an emailed statement. “I wish all of my American friends a happy Fourth of July.”
Fraser, an Ottawa-area member of the Ontario legislature, doesn't usually go to the party anyway, a spokesperson said.
But Jim Watson does, and sent their regrets this year, saying he's unhappy about the “constant attacks on our country.”
A spokesperson for Singh said the NDP leader was invited, but won't be attending as a show of protest against U.S. policies on trade and immigration.

“While they will not be attending the July 4th celebrations, Mr. Singh knows that it will take more than symbolic gestures to successfully pressure the Trump administration,” James Smith said in an email.
Goldfeder said they don't think the boycotts will impact the feel of the party at all.
“There are a handful of people who have decided to make this a comment on the Canada-U.S. relationship and that's fair,” they said.
“They're all in good, safe places to make that comment, but it's for their purposes. I don't think anyone realistically has an expectation that that's something the U.S. administration – especially this one – would be all that impressed by.”
WATCH: Canadian businesses suffer from retaliating against U.S. in trade war
Communications staff at the U.S. embassy have not yet responded to a request for comment about the party or the boycott. In Ireland, where several Irish MPs have made a show of boycotting the Fourth of July party in Dublin, the senior U.S. official at the embassy there suggested such a move was counterproductive.
“Everybody has the right to express themselves and how they do it, but I'm a firm believer in dialogue,” said Reece Smyth, the deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Dublin, which hasn't had an ambassador since Trump took office in January 2017.
“Even when we disagree, I think the dialogue needs to continue as that is the only way we can come to an agreement,” Smyth told the Irish Times newspaper.
WATCH: Americans apologize for Trump, pay tribute to #CanadaDay on social media
Ottawa-area MP Andrew Leslie, the government's parliamentary secretary for U.S.-Canada relations, is scheduled to attend. And Conservative defence critic James Bezan is flying back to Ottawa specifically for the party.
“It's our chance to go and celebrate Independence Day with the Americans and demonstrate we're friends,” said Bezan.
“Members of families sometimes have difficulties, and we have to find a way to work through this.”
SpaceX has successfully launched yet another rocket, this one carrying a Dragon capsule loaded with over 6,400 pounds of cargo destined for the International Space Station. That makes an even dozen for ISS resupply missions launched by SpaceX under contract to NASA, and this is the most significant thus far in terms of potential scientific impact.
CRS-12's payload was over 75 percent committed to hauling equipment and material for experiments and scientific research, which is more than on any other previous mission. Typically, the Dragon is loaded down with a greater percentage of supplies for the astronauts on board ISS, but this was intended more to set the stage for a range of experiments to be conducted by researchers on board the ISS during this year and in 2018. There's even an AR system on board designed to help astronauts improve their general efficiency.
The rocket successfully launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 12:31 PM EDT, and Dragon deployed from the second stage as planned. Dragon will rendezvous with the ISS on August 16 for capture by the station's Canadarm 2 robotic appendage, after which it'll be attached to the rocket. After roughly a month, it'll return to Earth after leaving the ISS with around 3,000 pounds of returned cargo on board, and splash down in the Pacific Ocean for recovery.
There's another reason this launch was significant, aside from its experimental payload (which included a supercomputer designed to help humans travel to Mars): SpaceX will only use re-used Dragon capsules for all future CRS missions, the company has announced, meaning this is the last time a brand-new Dragon will be used to resupply the ISS, if all goes to plan.
Today's launch also included an attempt to recover the Falcon 9 first stage for re-use at SpaceX's land-based LZ-1 landing pad. The Falcon 9 first stage returned to Earth as planned, and touched down at Cape Canaveral roughly 9 minutes after launch.

AUGUST 14, 2017 — U.S. Coast Guard 9th District, Great Lakes, reports that the 629 ft self-unloading bulker Calumet, a 629-foot ship that ran aground on the north side of Sugar Island in the St. Mary's River,Wednesday, was re-floated Friday, at approximately 8:50 PM, after the Coast Guard approved a salvage plan submitted by the vessel's owner, Rand Logistics subsidiary Grand River Navigation.
The St. Marys River, which had been closed to commercial vessel traffic from the Soo Locks to Six Mile Point following the grounding, was reopened at 9:30 p.m. Friday after the Army Corp of Engineers surveyed the bottom of the river in the vicinity of the grounding and found that no debris was obstructing the channel.
After the Calumet was refloated by offloading ballast water, it then sailed under its own power to anchorage near Lake Nickolet where it underwent an exterior and interior examination. No warping, indentations, or other damage to the hull was found.
There were no injuries during the incident or salvage operations. Coast Guard Station Sault Ste. Marie conducted a sunrise search this morning for any signs of pollution; no impact to the environment was found.

Dear Pakistan,
Hi. You are all probably familiar with me. I am pretty famous. These days you see me everywhere. In the smallest of incidents to the largest of calamities, you'll find me somewhere for sure. But I won't tell you who I am yet. Let's keep things a bit mysterious for now.
I decided to write this letter to get my presence officially noticed by you. You might have some mixed feelings about me taking over a majority of your aspects. Trust me, if I could've stopped myself, I would've. By now you might be wondering who I am. Let me give some clues and see if you can figure my identity out.
You can find me on the streets after a brainwashed radical takes innocent lives so that he'd get their seventy virgins in heaven. I was there when the classrooms were littered with slaughtered bodies of innocent dreams. I was there when the believers who bowed before God never rose up again. You can find me in hospital rooms where dirty, smelly people lie on the floors groaning in agony to deaf ears. You can search for me in schools as well, but usually in those alleys where the teacher can't see and a child curls up to shield their frail body from the blows. I am a common sight in those slums ‘good' people don't visit because the streets are boorish and the inhabitants boor.
When the owner raises their whip and pockets the money the child has roamed the streets for, I am often found. I used to be the harbinger of joy but now when I find myself with a sobbing bride, I feel myself to be a symbol of oppression. I am often a part of the taboos a woman carries on their shoulders. I am ashamed to play a part in being the measure of their purity and the reason of them being untouchable every month. The dot on the forehead of the Hindu woman, whose faith was scoffed at by some of your ‘pious' children, is one of my residence. I found myself on the face of the transgender who fought to make me a part of their identity, but was mocked, harassed and abused to do so. You can find me in the punishments the child fears they will get if they opened their mouth.
You can find me on the noose with which a ‘blasphemous' rascal hangs. Much to my own disbelief you can find me in warm and pretty houses when a woman bites their sobs and the husband preys on their beauty without their choice. In those bus stations at night where an innocent boy loses their light, often I am found there as well. You can find me on the other end of the pistol an angry father has aimed at their daughter. I am a common visitor in plights of those who open their mouths to speak for their rights as well. Perhaps I only showed you the grim side of where I am found. Perhaps I am biased and no longer sound. But dear Pakistan I wish I was on those sheets on their wedding night so they had lived and smiled. I wish I was the joyous tint on the cheeks of parents when their children understood their plight.
I wish I was with the roses showered on honest leaders for their hard work of days and nights. I wish you found me with the books little children held not the knives. By now you might have guessed who I am. I, my dear Pakistan, am your people's new favourite color. I am the new identity of the land of the pure. I am the color you find on the sign saying “high voltage” outside a politician's house. My name is Red.
From heralding love in a rose to being the blood stains on the child beaten by their teacher for asking a question, I'm not proud of my journey nor should you. It's your 70th birthday and you must be quite proud. You survived this long despite the onslaught by enemies who sought your end. I am proud of you for that as well so you will find me in the flowers on your father's grave. You are as old as a wise elderly man now. Call me suicidal but this letter is a plea for you to find me and do me right. I no longer wish to be the adornment of your children's graves. It might take you another seventy years to rein me in, but it is an urgent matter you must attend to. Find me in the smaller agony, cure me and then find me in a larger one. I hope one day we meet only in jubilant circumstances.
Just another color of the rainbow,
Red

PARIS-Nearly half of endangered land mammals and a quarter of birds are already harmed by climate change - a much higher segment than previously thought, researchers have found.
Endangered primates and elephants are among the groups squeezed the hardest by global warming, partly because they reproduce slowly and take longer to adapt to rapid environmental changes, they reported. While most studies seek to predict global warming's future impact on animal survival, the new analysis found that for “large numbers” of threatened species, the damage was already being done.
The data suggests that “the impact of climate change on mammals and birds in the recent past is currently greatly under-appreciated,” according to a study in the journal Nature Climate Change this week.
Researchers had amassed data from 136 previous studies looking at 120 mammals and 569 bird species.
They compared documented changes in climate with growth or decline in population size, geographic range, reproductive and survival rates and body mass.
The team then extrapolated the data to all land mammals and birds listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
Of the 873 listed mammal species, 414 (47 percent) have likely “responded negatively” to climate change, and 298 (just over 23 percent) of 1,272 birds, the researchers found.
Climate change can affect animals by limiting food and water, spreading disease and shrinking living space.
Only seven percent of mammals and four percent of birds identified by the study were coded on the IUCN Red List as threatened by “climate change and severe weather”, the authors said. “We recommend that research and conservation efforts give greater attention to the ‘here and now' of climate change impacts on life on Earth,” the researchers said.
“Conservation managers, planners and policymakers must take this into account in efforts to safeguard the future of biodiversity.” In December 2015, 195 nations adopted the Paris Agreement to limit average global warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-Industrial Revolution levels.
This would be achieved by curbing planet-heating greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas.
But scientists warn that 2C is already too high, and that the world is on track for warming even beyond that, with disastrous consequences for life as we know it.
(Reuters) - Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc lost almost 5 percent on Tuesday as a surge in costs drove what analysts said was its biggest ever contraction in gross margins, overshadowing strong first-quarter ad sales.

The dive in first-quarter operating margins, to 22 percent from 27 percent a year ago, follows a troubling six weeks for major U.S. tech players, now facing a more questioning public and the prospect of tighter official scrutiny on privacy issues.
The fall in Alphabet shares following its first quarter results on Monday evening turned them negative for the year and amounted to a roughly $37 billion reduction in the value of the Mountain View, California-based firm.
At least 8 brokerages cut their price targets on the shares, compared to four who raised.
But analysts were reluctant to place the blame as yet on the row over user data which has engulfed Facebook and threatens to encourage more regulation of internet companies.
“There is regulatory risk, though we have yet to find evidence that regulations will adversely impact the usefulness of Google for consumers or advertisers,” RBC analysts said.
Longer-term capital expenditures at Google nearly tripled to $7.3 billion in the first quarter from $2.5 billion a year ago.
The company said that continuing cost increases came from acquiring streaming rights for YouTube's new TV service and marketing new products.
Google executives say the spending to install powerful computers and internet cables is necessary to keep up with demand for YouTube, its Google Assistant virtual helper service and data analytics tools within its Google Cloud services.
“With YouTube's rapid growth (also in non-ad-supported services) and a greater emphasis on hardware made by Google, we think this gross margin contraction will continue,” Cannacord Genuity analyst Michael Graham wrote in a client note.
“Gross margin contracted ~370 bps y/y, (that is) the largest contraction in company history.”
Ad sales also suggested that there were no immediate signs of the privacy concerns affecting profits.
Shares of the company have risen 25 percent in the past year, making it the third best performing of the FAANG group of tech stocks, trailing only Amazon and Netflix.
LAHORE - Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has warned of East Pakistan-like tragedy if sanctity of vote is not established in the country.
In their first address to media after home-return rally from Islamabad to Lahore at Hazoori Bagh here yesterday, they said now their top most agenda is establishing respect of the vote and speedy justice to the masses for which “he would do anything from amending the Constitution to changing the laws.”
Nawaz Sharif said the charade that has been going on for over last 70 years must end now. “Otherwise, Pakistan can face another tragedy which it cannot afford,” they said, vowing to firm-up sanctity of the ballot and make it observe by others.
They did not take queries from the media persons, who had been waiting for around three hours to interact with him.
They said during the last four years rule their development agenda changed the country. “The interruption in their rule is a great setback to the continuity of the economic development and to availability of jobs to the youth,” the ex-premier said, alluding to their removal from the office by the Supreme Court.
“Pakistan came into being through the power of law and the vote but unfortunately both were cast away after the death of Quaid-e-Azam [Muhammad Ali Jinnah] and Quaid-e-Millat [Liaqat Ali Khan] and the doctrine of necessity took their place which led to dismemberment of Pakistan in 1971. But no lesson has been learned from this tragedy,” they said, after paying homage to the Poet of the East, Allama Muhammad Iqbal at their mausoleum.
Nawaz said today they feel ashamed visiting the mausoleum of the Quaid and Iqbal as Pakistan is not what they had thought of. They emphatically said that the time has come to put the country on the path set by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
They said the country has been suffering over the last 70 years due to disrespect to the public mandate as it runs contrary to the spirit of democracy and the objective of Pakistan's creation.
“Today we are celebrating 70th Independence Day yet we would have truly enjoyed the day, had East Pakistan been also our part - equally contributing to the progress and the development of the country.” Nawaz Sharif said respect to the public mandate would have saved East Pakistan from separation.
Former prime minister said in their four-year stay in power they delivered to end energy crisis and bring peace with many projects of development underway. I would have done more had I been not removed from the office, they added, arguing, “the sea of people accompanying them in the rally was vindicated this fact.”
They said their next agenda on coming to power in the election is to provide speedy and inexpensive justice to the masses. “We will ensure social, judicial and economic justice to the people”, they said citing the slow pace in administration of justice where a case by the grandfather fails decision till the grandson and the case costs them their entire properties. “Neither it [the delayed justice] nor disparity was the objective of Pakistan creation.”
The former premier said Pakistan belongs to its 200 million inhabitants and not to a handful people, and vowed to provide shelter to the poor on coming to power again. “I am speaking from my heart and I will surely prove true to my words,” they said adding, “Our aim will be to make Pakistan stronger politically and economically.”
Nawaz Sharif said after four years of their rule, Pakistan was much more developed and peaceful than it was in 2013. “The economic progress has received a serious jolt from what had been done to him, which is extremely regrettable,” they said.

WATERLOO — BlackBerry's chief marketing officer admits their own mother may not really understand what the company is up to these days.
And that's just fine, Mark Wilson says.
"There will be people who won't know what our enterprise strategy is," they said Monday during a sit-down in Waterloo with journalists at BlackBerry's global sales summit. "At the end of the day, my mom is not the target market for us."
Gone are the days when the smartphone pioneer's market was virtually anyone in the world who might want to use one of its devices. As the company pivots away from hardware to focus solely on software and cybersecurity, its market, too, has focused.
When it comes to potential enterprise clients — users such as banks, law firms, hospitals and governments — the global market might be 40,000 strong, Wilson said. "It's a fundamentally different marketing mix."
But it's also a recognition that BlackBerry's transition — from hardware to software — and turnaround, is complete, they said. Hardware to software. Eighty-five per cent of the company's revenue now comes from enterprise software.
There are still BlackBerry-branded devices being made, but they're produced and sold by Chinese firm TCL and a couple of other manufacturers under licensing agreements.
BlackBerry has leveraged what set it apart in the smartphone world — security — and applied it now to what's called the Enterprise of Things. It's a recognition that as more everyday objects are connected in the Internet of Things, businesses are finding there are more things that must be managed and protected as well, both physical (like computers, phones and cars) and digital (such as files and communications).
"The whole market is moving towards security," Wilson said. "That plays well in terms of our position in the market."
A company committed to securing its Enterprise of Things can comfortably adapt to a workplace that's accessed remotely, often on personal devices, by a workforce that can include less-permanent staff like contractors or seasonal employees, Wilson said. BlackBerry software also improves workflow while ensuring security remains paramount.

ON August 15, we celebrate the Independence Day. On that day, in 1947, Prime Minister Nehru proclaimed a tryst with destiny, “a moment which comes but rarely in history when we step from the old into the new, when an age ends and the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance”.
The colonial rule destroyed the Indian economy and greatly impoverished the people of India. An estimate by the Cambridge historian Angus Wilson reveals that in 1700, India's share of the world income was 22.6 per cent comparable to the entire income of Europe which was then at 23.3 percent. By 1952, however, India's share fell to 2.3 per cent of the world income.
Foreigners' accounts
By all accounts, India was a prosperous nation at the onset of western colonialism. The French traveller Jean – Baptiste Tavernier in their ‘Travels in India', written in the 17th century, gives the following account of Indian life. “Even in the smallest villages, rice, flour, butter, milk, beans and other vegetables, sugar and sweetmeats can be procured in abundance”. Yet, during the British rule, as per government records of the time, 70 to 80 per cent of Indians were living at subsistence levels, two thirds were undernourished and in Bengal nearly four fifths were undernourished.
At all times in its history, even the most distressing, India was revered by the great minds across the continents. The renowned American historian, Will Durant summed it up: “India was the motherland of our race, and Sanskrit the mother of Europe's languages: they were the mother of our philosophy; mother, through the Arabs, of much of our mathematics; mother, through the Buddha, of the ideals embodied in Christianity; mother, through the village community, of self-government and democracy. Mother India is in many ways the mother of us all”.
The freedom struggle was not just for political freedom. It was not merely to dislodge foreign rulers and install our own. It was also for social and economic change and for a life of peace and dignity to all citizens. Whilst India witnesses rapid economic growth, there are still vast numbers of people in the country who face grave problems of illiteracy, disease and poverty. What is required is greater attention to inclusive development that benefits significantly all sections of the population.
We, the people of India, must rise above our religious, ethnic and linguistic diversity and together deal with the multifarious tasks that confront us today. The framework for responsible citizenship and national regeneration has been laid down in the Indian Constitution in three parts. Part III of the Constitution deals with the Fundamental Rights, Part IV with the Directive Principles of State Policy and part IVA with the Fundamental Duties. Fundamental Rights are basic human rights which the state recognises and it provides for their enforcement. We are all equally human, the world is one family and all human rights are for all. The nature and extent of state responsibility for the protection of human rights in India was indicated by the National Human Rights Commission in the case of the Gujarat riots of 2002. It said, “It is the primary and inescapable responsibility of the state to protect the right to life, liberty, equality and dignity of all those who constitute it. It is also the responsibility of the state to ensure that such rights are not violated either through overt acts or through abetment or negligence”.
The Directives Principles of State Policy are guidelines to be kept in mind by the government whilst framing laws and policies. These guidelines include free and compulsory education to all children below the age of 14 years and provision of adequate means of livelihood to all.
The Fundamental Duties are moral obligations of all citizens and are specifically intended to promote responsible citizenship and national unity and harmony. We often harp on our rights but neglect and may even be unaware of our duties. Mahatma Gandhi remarked: “I learnt from my illiterate but wise mother that all rights to be deserved and preserved come from duty well done.”
The Constitution lists ten Fundamental Duties. Each has a distinct role and importance in our polity. One of the fundamental duties is “to provide harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood among all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities”.
Cohesiveness and unity
What is needed is a citizenry conscious of their rights and of their duties. The Union and state governments should work together with voluntary organisations to promote awareness of our constitutional rights as well as of our responsibilities and to sensitise the citizens to the values enshrined in the Constitution.
India is a multicultural country. A multicultural society needs to find ways and means to accommodate diversity without losing its cohesiveness and unity. Assimilation which requires minorities to abandon their own distinctive institutions to merge in to the prevailing culture is to be avoided. This way is sociologically unlikely to succeed and is morally untenable in view of people's deep adherence to normative values such as religion. Similarly, unbounded multiculturalism which entails giving up the concept of shared values and identity in order to privilege ethnic and religious differences presuming that a nation can be replaced by a number of diverse minorities is unacceptable.
Cultural pluralism implements policies of inclusion that cater to the requirements of all groups. The sensitivities of the minorities as well as of the majority need attention.
The Constitution of India ensures that all citizens have equal rights and should have an equal opportunity. In particular, the principle of secularism enshrined in our Constitution is the best method to accommodate religious diversity and could be emulated across the globe. In a multicultural society, the state cannot be identified with any religious or cultural group and it should either be neutral or even-handed in its approach to all such groups. Unity in diversity is the highest possible civilizational attainment. It is made possible through respect for choice in an atmosphere of mutual trust.
Through one-third of their first NHL season, the Vegas Golden Knights are tied for fifth in NHL team scoring with 101 goals. That number is plus-11 versus their opponents, and VGK's per-game average of 3.48 goals is third only to the New York Islanders and Tampa Bay Lightning.
To help compile this list of the top five percent of Vegas tallies, I recruited a roundtable of my fellow Golden Knights columnists from The Hockey Writers. Eduardo Razo, Dalton Tinklenberg, Eric Hall, and Thomas Conroy added this assessment of VGK's early competitiveness.
Early season success gained by the Vegas Golden Knights has been fueled by a blend of youth and age. The talent put on the ice each night has been quite impressive as the future of the NHL in Las Vegas is bright.
#5 We Are Vegas Strong
Eduardo Razo – As the Vegas Golden Knights continue their Cinderella-like season, the best goal I've seen came in their home opener versus the Arizona Coyotes on Oct. 10. After a mass shooting nine days earlier, which rocked the city of Las Vegas and the entire country to its core, this brand-new hockey team attempted to help take minds off the tragedy, even if it was for just one night. Following the pre-game ceremony honoring first responders, Derek Engelland, former Las Vegas Wranglers player, and off-season Valley resident, gave a heartfelt speech of support to the sold-out crowd.
Then, as fate would have it, the defenseman would also score the second of five VGK goals that night. Only four minutes into the first period, Brendan Leipsic created a turnover at the Arizona high-slot and curled to find Engelland for a one-timer through a double screen at the top right circle. The crowd erupted. This goal won't make many highlight reels, but it will surely have a place in Vegas' top goals in their inaugural season.
#4 Undefeated in Overtime
Dalton Tinklenberg – The biggest goal for the first third of this NHL season has to be Jonathan Marchessault's overtime goal against the San Jose Sharks on Nov. 24. Shortly after the start of overtime, the winger blasted a goal past Sharks' netminder Aaron Dell for the win on home ice. After receiving the puck from Shea Theodore in the left faceoff circle, Marchessault used a few shifty moves before lasering the puck, deflecting first off the goalie's left skate and then off Joe Thornton's right boot blade into the net.
The extra-frame goal sealed the Golden Knights' eighth-straight victory at home. More importantly, it helped keep their first-place momentum in the Pacific division. This particular game was VGK's fourth of five overtime wins this year in as many tries. The goal saved the Golden Knights from what could have been a massive collapse after they led by three goals at one point, similar to their Oct. 17 game against the Sabres.
#3 The Frenchy Dangle
Eric Hall – Pierre-Édouard Bellemare's second-ever Vegas goal on Nov. 7 was incredible. Down 2-0 for most of the first period at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Bellemare found themselves practically alone in the offensive zone with three minutes to play. After corralling the dumped-in puck, No. 41 used their stick-handles to swerve their way through two defenders and put the puck in the net. After making former Bolts winger Jonathan Drouin miss, they five-holed defenseman Jeff Petry and followed that with another five-hole of Canadiens' goalie Charlie Lindgren.
The goal was important for the team as it shifted momentum going into the first intermission. Scoring late in the first period shrunk the Canadiens lead and gave Vegas hope for a comeback effort. Ultimately, the team lost to Montreal 3-2, but Bellemare's dangle goal put the team in a better position on enemy ice during a tough East Coast road trip.
#2 Wild Bill is a Top Line Center
Jonathan West – Oct. 21 was T-Mobile Arena's first-ever Saturday night hockey game for the Golden Knights, and the first draw this year against the league-leading St. Louis Blues. After finishing regulation in a 2-2 tie, VGK entered overtime with their third-string goalie Oscar Dansk after Malcolm Subban was injured in the third period.
With 30 seconds left until a shootout, Blues winger Vladimir Sobotka passed to Alex Steen who mishandled the puck on a Vegas double team. Steen and Sobotka's tangling with Knights defenseman Brad Hunt created a two-on-one for the home team. Reilly Smith's pass underneath the stick of a diving Alex Pietrangelo found William Karlsson for an off-wing one-timer to win it.
Drafted out of the Swedish Hockey League by the Anaheim Ducks in 2011 and traded to Columbus Blue Jackets in 2015, it looked as if “Wild Bill” (who got that nickname from the Ducks staff early on) was shaping up to be another NHL journeyman. But now it seems like No. 71 has hit the reset button and is disproving even the harshest critics. Their 15 goals and 26 points lead the expansion team.
#1 James Neal and Vegas' First Win
Thomas Conroy – If Hollywood was casting the role of a classic hockey goal-scorer, then James Neal fits the bill. They have netted over 20 goals in each of their 10 NHL seasons, but none was more important than their opening night game-winning goal against the Dallas Stars earlier this season.
In the days prior to the season-opener, there wasn't a guarantee that Neal would play against the Stars, and not only did they play, but Neal scored both Knights goals in a hard fought 2-1 win. Neal's first goal was their patent wrist shot from the top of the face-off circle, but the second goal will forever be etched in Golden Knights history.
The go-ahead goal came on a beautiful lead pass by Cody Eakin on a 2-on-1 breakaway as Neal lost their edge while lifting the puck over Stars goaltender Kari Lehtonen from their knees with 2:44 remaining in the game.
Neal's effort on the goal set the tone for the season. From that moment, the Golden Knights were going to be quite different than past NHL expansion franchises. This isn't a group of misfits that are lucky to have a job in the NHL. No, this is a roster dedicated to winning each night they lace up their skates.

Islamabad - Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) on Tuesday restarted kidney transplant surgery at the hospital after gap of six years.
A team of surgeons included Urologist Prof Musharraf, Dr Sajid Mumtaz Qazi and Dr Khalid participated in the transplant surgery of 25-year patient Waheed. Prof Tanveer Khaliq, Prof Iqbal Memon, Dr Rana Imran and Dr Sohail Tanveer were also part of medical team.
A family member of patient Waheed had donated the kidney who was renal failure patient.
Talking to media, Executive Director PIMS Dr Amjad Mehmood said that another kidney transplant surgery will be conducted on Wednesday. They added the present management of the hospital will continue transplant surgeries keeping in view the burden of such patients.
They said that in second phase, the hospital will start liver transplant surgeries in the hospital to serve the patients. The federal government has allowed the hospital to appoint transplant surgeons.
WASHINGTON - Sprint has said that the 5,000 US jobs the telecom firm recently pledged to create over the next 15 months are not part of an April 2015 announcement for a different 5,000 jobs.
The confusion -- which prompted the company's chief Marcelo Claure to take to Twitter in defense of the plan -- arose after Donald Trump announced Sprint's jobs commitment this week. The president-elect claimed credit for the deal as well as an announcement earlier this month by the satellite broadband firm OneWeb of 3,000 new jobs over the next four years.
However, both new job commitments are part of a broader plan announced in October by SoftBank -- which owns 80 percent of Sprint -- to invest tens of billions of dollars in technology globally. The OneWeb project is the result of a $1.2 billion investment from the group. SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son met Trump earlier this month, pledging to invest $50 billion in the US economy and create 50,000 jobs over an unspecified time.
That prompted Trump to take credit for job creation even before they assume office in January, praising what called "the spirit and the hope" their election generated. A Sprint spokesperson said on Friday that the 5,000 new jobs announced this week "are not related to our previous announcement about jobs and our Direct 2 You program reported on in April 2015. The announcements are unrelated."
Unlike last year's plan, the newer one is "part of Masa's 50,000 jobs commitment and it was intended to show that we are now working to help fulfill the commitment." Claure followed Trump's example, taking to Twitter Thursday following reports that the latest Sprint job pledge is not new. "Stop speculating," they said. "This has NOTHING to do with previously announced @sprint initiatives." "The 5,000 jobs are NEW jobs that @sprint is creating or bringing back to the US. Great news for the country."
Sprint, which announced 2,500 layoffs in January, said the 5,000 positions will be created or brought back from overseas by the end of its 2017 fiscal year, which ends in March 2018. It has not yet decided where the jobs will be created, saying only that they will be spread across the organisation.
Claure -- who held a fundraiser for Trump's Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in September, calling Trump "too risky" -- said in the announcement this week that "we are excited to work with President-elect Trump and their administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the US."
Benedict Cumberbatch is turning Ian McEwan's “The Child in Time” into a TV movie for BBC One and Masterpiece.
The project comes from the “Sherlock” and “Dr. Strange” star's SunnyMarch TV shingle, and is a co-production between Masterpiece for BBC One and Pinewood Studios and SunnyMarch TV. Cumberbatch will executive produce and star in the 90-minute film, with Stephen Butchard adapting McEwan's novel and Julian Farino directing. Studiocanal serves as distributor.
The film will explore the dark territory of a marriage devastated by the loss of a child: Cumberbatch will play children's author Stephen Lewis, who must cope with the sudden loss of their daughter, Kate. Kate's absence sets Stephen and their wife on diverging paths as both struggle with an all-consuming grief. With the passage of time, a balance of sorts returns, until hope surfaces and triumphs unexpectedly.
CAIRO - Egypt's parliament approved a treaty ceding sovereignty over two uninhabited Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, House of Representatives Speaker Ali Abdelaal said on Wednesday.
The treaty must now be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a formality.
Sisi's government last year announced a maritime demarcation agreement with Saudi Arabia, which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt, ceding control of the islands of Tiran and Sanafir to the Gulf kingdom.
A key parliamentary committee had already unanimously backed the plan and referred it to parliament for a final vote before it can be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, its chairperson told journalists.
Sisi's government last year announced a maritime demarcation agreement with Saudi Arabia, which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt, ceding control of the islands of Tiran and Sanafir to the Gulf kingdom.
“We have unanimously approved the maritime demarcation accord with Saudi Arabia and it will be voted on in the general session today,” said House of Representatives Committee on Defence and National Security Chairman Kamal Amer.
Some members of the committee who did not attend the meeting on Wednesday criticized the decision to approve the accord.
The transfer plan triggered rare street protests last year from many Egyptians, who say their country's sovereignty over the islands dates back to a treaty from 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded.
Dozens of protesters gathered in downtown Cairo on Tuesday evening and organizers said a handful were briefly detained.
The Egyptian and Saudi governments say the islands are Saudi but have been subject to Egyptian protection since 1950 at the request of Saudi Arabia's King Abdulaziz Al Saud.
The treaty has also been referred to the courts, irritating Riyadh and raising tensions between two major Arab states and traditional allies.
Egypt's highest administrative court blocked the deal but parliament insists the matter is constitutionally within its domain, putting the legislature and the judiciary at odds.
A government report advising parliament on the terms of the agreement said Egypt would keep administrative control over the islands and Egyptians would not need visas to visit them if they were transferred to Saudi Arabia.
Bogdanovich's William Hill sportsbook listed the city's new hockey team as 250-to-1 long shots to win the Stanley Cup in their first year of existence. The true odds before the season, they said, should've been closer to 2,500 to 1.
With the Golden Knights holding a one-game advantage heading into Game 2 Wednesday night, William Hill could be three Vegas wins away from losing close to $2 million (U.S.). One bettor is in for $1,000 on a 50-1 ticket. Another has $200 at 200-1. And there are many smaller bets that were placed at 250-1.
“Every expert had them finishing dead-last or maybe next to last in the Western Conference,” said Bogdanovich, William Hill's chief oddsmaker.
“We're going to be wrong, and we'll just have to pay,” Bogdanovich said.
Casinos all along the Strip are facing similar circumstances, and the total liability in Las Vegas has been estimated at $5 million to $7 million, which would likely mark the city's biggest loss on futures betting.
While seven-figure losses sound big on the surface, casinos are accustomed to occasionally taking their lumps. Jay Kornegay, who runs the sportsbook at the Westgate Las Vegas, likened the potential hit to a really bad weekend during the football season.
This Stanley Cup final represents a unique case study, a nexus of hometown rooting interests and legal sports wagering. As states across the country consider regulating sports wagering in light of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a federal law that had previously outlawed it, fans may soon have an easier pathway to laying down both a rooting and a financial interest in their favourite teams' games. The series also underscores the risks at play, particularly for the house. In Las Vegas, locals backed the long shot and casinos are now bracing for a big hit.
With hundreds — and likely many more — of Golden Knights' tickets floating around town, bets made months ago are suddenly big business. PropSwap is a site that serves as a secondary market for sports bets, allowing gamblers to unload active tickets for guaranteed cash rather than waiting for the game or event to take place.
“It's a way for you to get rich and your team can still win,” said co-founder Luke Pergande. “Some people might describe it as an emotional hedge.”
The biggest Vegas ticket currently listed on PropSwap was originally purchased for $300 at 400-to-1 odds. It would pay out $120,000 if the Knights win three more games. A bettor could buy that ticket right now for the asking price of $95,000.
Pergande knows the risks and rewards. He, after all, bought a $50 ticket back in October at 500-to-1 odds. “I didn't think they were going to win the Cup,” they said, “but I knew the number felt off.”
After the Knights' hot start, they sold the ticket in November for $550, a tenfold return on their investment. The new owner of that ticket now stands to make $25,000.
“I have no regrets,” Pergande said. “I basically hit a 10-to-1 winner and paid my rent. Who's going to cry about that?”
Oddsmakers around town agree that most Golden Knights tickets were purchased as souvenirs, a keepsake for fans to frame and save. Kornegay said he's still heard from fans recently claiming they were convinced back in October the Knights were bound for the final.
“I don't believe them. ‘Oh, I saw this coming.' Sure you did,” they said with a chuckle. “Why'd you only bet a whole $10 then?”
There's at least one such hockey fan who's already cashed a big ticket and insists they had a gut feeling before the season that Vegas would reach the final in their first season. They also predicted they'd face the Caps. Motivated by historical trends and gambler hunches, a Washington man named Howard placed a pair of bets back in early October.
(The Washington Post agreed to use only their first name because their bet was made using an online sportsbook.) They felt good about the Caps and Golden Knights and placed $100 on Vegas to reach the finals and another $100 on the Caps to win it all. At 300-to-1 odds, the Golden Knights paid out $30,000 after winning the Western Conference. Howard stands to win another $1,000 if the Caps — at 10-1 odds — manage to hoist the cup.
Howard believed in George McPhee, the Vegas general manager, and felt good about the addition of goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury. They felt strongly that the team and city would respond to the mass shooting in October similarly to the Red Sox, who won the World Series following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. “It dawned on me how tragedy can motivate a team and motivate players to another level [and] inspire a fan base to get more involved,” they said.
The hockey team certainly has become a rallying point for Las Vegas, and the arrival of the Golden Knights changed the nature of hockey betting in Las Vegas. It had historically been a low-dollar business for sports books, but the interest in the team sent many new fans scurrying to the betting windows.
The professional gamblers counting on a terrible team were getting crushed from Day 1, and newly converted puckheads kept cashing bets, courtesy of a team that was beating everyone's expectations.
“Look, I've been in the business since ‘86. I said I thought it'd increase hockey a little, but nothing significant,” Bogdanovich said. “I think the main reason I was wrong is they got off to the fast start and were winning from Day 1. The whole town drank the punch and a lot of them started betting on hockey. Once they started watching, they liked it. They started betting it and they were winning money. And the whole thing snowballed and snowballed.”
Kornegay estimates that their sportsbook see 15 to 20 times more action on Golden Knights' contests than other NHL games. And because the Golden Knights usually won — posting a 47-31 record against the spread, including 28-13 at home — local fans who bet with their hearts often walked away winners.
Betting on the home team was largely a new experience for locals. Although sports books have taken bets on UNLV games since 2001, the Golden Knights represented the first big gambling-friendly local sporting event that the entire community could rally behind.
Kornegay is a longtime bookmaker, but he's also a sports fan and a Golden Knights season-ticket holder. They know their employer stands to lose money in this series, but they also know the team has been a great addition to the local community.
“The majority of us are all rooting for them,” they said. “When we're booking games, we're always booking for the best interests of our operation. But when I leave, I can put my fan hat on and root for our team. Everyone here is on board and happy to have something like the Golden Knights to root for.”

Five things to look forward to in Europe this week
European football action continues in another exciting week.
by Rahul Top 5 / Top 10 15 Feb 2017, 15:49 IST
Can Sutton's fairy tale continue?
European continental action returns again as the remaining teams in the Champions League Round of 16 play out their first-leg ties. The Europa League Round of 32 will conclude with Manchester United and Tottenham fighting for a place in the next round.
Premier League football will be put on hold for a week as action in the FA Cup returns. The other European leagues, however, will continue as scheduled.
#1 The magic of the FA Cup returns
The FA Cup has already provided us with some thoroughly entertaining fixtures this season. This week marks the return of the oldest domestic cup competition as we head into the fifth round. Each fixture will feature a Premier League team facing off against lower league opposition.
Burnley and Middlesbrough play host to Lincoln City and Oxford United respectively, while current champions Leicester City make the trip to Millwall. Both Manchester clubs will have away fixtures, with Jose Mourinho's side making the short trip to Blackburn and Pep Guardiola's men travelling to Huddersfield Town.
Chelsea travels to Wolves, while fellow London club Tottenham take on Fulham at Craven Cottage. But the story of the week is undoubtedly Arsenal's tie against the lowest-ranked side in the competition. Sutton United have exceeded expectations but will have a mighty task ahead of them if they are to beat the Gunners. Sutton are currently 16th in the fifth division of English football and they will cherish the opportunity to play against the most successful team in FA Cup history.

A man accused of murder appeared in court Monday.
Kamaua Van Gieson, 20, is accused of killing Dustin Molina, 18.
Molina's body was found on a Maili beach last Tuesday.
Investigators have not yet released a cause of death or given a possible motive.
Van Gieson is also suspected of kidnapping their ex-girlfriend just days before Molina was found dead.
They were not charged in that case.
Their bail was confirmed at $1 million.
Innovative Marketing Ideas for Small Business and Entrepreneurs: Monetizing Customer Complaints
Building loyalty with a dissatisfied customer is easier than you might think.
When a customer complains, a great opportunity opens up for you to build loyalty. Are you taking advantage of it?
Making your customers happy isn't a walk in the park
Satisfying your customers is a complex task because it is an attempt to meet – or even exceed – their expectations, and as these expectations are subjective,they can differ from one customer to another.
A recent study conducted by Customer Care Measuring & Consulting provides two valuable pieces of data of great relevance in this regard.
The first says that customers who complain, but have not yet had their problem resolved, are 12% less loyal to a brand than those who have no complaint. However, the second says that when the complaint is resolved to the client's satisfaction, the effect is the reversed, and a 21% greater loyalty is achieved. Thus, a dissatisfied customer who has had their problem resolved in a satisfactory manner will be more loyal to the brand than a customer who never had any issue with the service.
Do you see the opportunity? Many successful entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos and James Dyson, were able to identify and take advantage of this opportunity.
Of course, it would be very easy to ‘plant' problems and then solve them in order to gain customer loyalty, wouldn't it? It sounds like a strategy, so why doesn't anyone apply it?
It's simple. Successfully resolving a complaint costs money. You must invest resources to recover a customer. If you're not willing to do it, it's better to let it go.
You can't pretend to maintain a profitable transaction after a problem for which you were responsible. What you have to aim for is a profitable long-term relationship.
Companies that invest money in managing complaints and claims from their customers have an invaluable resource at their fingertips.
Non-monetary options for increasing customer loyalty
The study mentioned another interesting point based on analysis of the type of compensation offered to customers: It is possible to increase customer loyalty by only adding non-monetary rewards to material compensation. Yes, it has been proven that 74% of customers have been completely satisfied when they have been offered both types of compensation (monetary + non-monetary), compared to only 37% of customers compensated with only monetary rewards.
This is a fantastic piece of information because it means you can earn twice as much loyalty without spending an extra penny.
But what are some effective non-monetary rewards?
It is easy to take advantage of your opportunity to retain more dissatisfied customers by:
Worthy treatment of the customer
A spontaneous response (not established with a script)
Assurance that the problem will not be repeated
An explanation of what happened
A thank you for being a customer
A show of empathy for the customer's concerns
Giving the customer the opportunity to vent and …
Offering an apology
In short, acknowledge their frustrations and genuinely try to solve their problem. Is this too much to ask? Enrich your customer complaint processes with sincere gestures and person to person communication.
Conclusion
You'll soon see the difference, and building customer loyalty requires much less investment and resources than continually acquiring new customers. A satisfied customer will also not hesitate to recommend you and your business to others – which is invaluable!
So who is to blame for Mimi's snafu on ‘Dick Clark's Rockin' Eve' special?

Rhode Island coach Dan Hurley had conversations with UConn and Pittsburgh on Monday and is considered the primary target for both openings, but will sit down with Rams athletic director Thorr Bjorn on Tuesday before making a decision, sources told ESPN.
"He's not close to a decision yet," one source close to Hurley told ESPN. "He's still researching it all."
Rhode Island coach Dan Hurley has taken the Rams to two straight NCAA Tournaments. Kelley L Cox/USA TODAY Sports
Hurley, 45, has been the top target of Huskies athletic director David Benedict since they decided to fire Kevin Ollie. Hurley is 112-82 in six seasons, and has taken the Rams to the NCAA tournament each of the past two years.
Sources told ESPN that Pittsburgh has also made Hurley its top target, but they prefer the UConn job due to its history. The Huskies have won four national titles in the past 20 years, but have fallen off over the past few years under Ollie after winning the national championship in 2014. Pittsburgh's advantages include being a member of the ACC and likely offering more money.
URI lost to Duke on Saturday in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Immediately afterwards, Hurley didn't want to talk specifics about any openings.
"Listen, I could give a crap about who's got an opening anywhere," Hurley said. "I haven't thought about it for a second. I could care less what any other school in the country that's looking for a coach or talks about me on social media -- I could give two craps about that. My heart, my mind is with this program and these players that just lost a brutal game after having an amazing last couple seasons, and for me it's easy."
Hurley signed a seven-year deal last year worth a little more than $1 million per year. Bjorn recently told ESPN that they know there will be opportunities coming Hurley's way, but that he'll try to be creative in an effort to keep their coach in Kingston, Rhode Island. Bjorn also said they know they can't match many of the high-major programs financially.
LeBron James proved it again this year.  They are a fantastic leader, who carries – drags – their team along with him. In the NBA, they are – without a doubt – the greatest current player, and perhaps one of the greatest players of all time. They are, in short, both a gifted player and a gifted leader. Perhaps this year more than any other in the past, their leadership skills are on display as their Cleveland Cavaliers meet the Golden State Warriors for this year's NBA Championship. By all accounts, the Warriors should win; but, who would dare bet against the Cavs? Not with LeBron's leadership.
Enter Connor McDavid. During last season's final weeks of the NHL scoring race, McDavid showed just how dominant they could be as a player. It was almost as if they simply set their mind to it; and, when they did they quickly caught up and surpassed any other competitor for the scoring lead. Reminds me a bit of The Great One.
LeBron is older and has played more years than McDavid. Those years – that experience – mean something. In those years, they have improved as a player, but they have also worked on the craft of leadership, which is likely harder to engage than talent is. Now, it is McDavid's turn to become the team leader that LeBron is.
The question is “What can LeBron James teach Connor McDavid as a team leader?”
Related: Should The Oilers Go for Antoine Roussel?
The LeBron Lessons
Long-Term Vision Lesson
First, if we ignore the rumors of LeBron's leaving Cleveland at the end of this season (and at this point, they are only rumors), James can teach McDavid to engage a long-term vision, and this vision is the most important leadership trait any effective leader shows.
Remember that James is from Ohio, and returned to their home state with the simple purpose of leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship. James' belief that this would happen led their teammates to believe as well. The result? Vision instills confidence, and confidence creates reality. And, sports – more than any other area of life – magically uses the fuel of confidence to run the motor of winning.
In short, McDavid's leadership must build the vision that the Oilers WILL win. McDavid cannot be shy about talking to their teammates – one-by-one. Their message must be that each of them is integral to the team's success and that the team, with them engaging their unique skill and part, is greater than the sum of its individual players.
The Walks the Talk Lesson
The second leadership lesson LeBron James can teach is to walk the talk. While they can dominate a game and often win it by himself, when you watch James play, it isn't their skill that catches your eye – it's the way they bring their teammates into the play. They see both the court and the long-term goal. They make their teammates better because they make them parts of the action. If they are open, they get them the ball and expects them to do something with it. Fortunately, McDavid – like Gretzky before them – seems wired that way. They value the assist – even the 2ndassist – as much scoring a goal. McDavid simply needs to keep doing what they are doing.
Hockey may be different than basketball in that one player may have less of an overall impact on the ice than a basketballer does on the court, but there is no denying McDavid's ability to take over a game, include their linemates and motivate long stretches of play.

They Never Give Up Lesson
The third leadership lesson LeBron James can teach is that “never-give-up” attitude. When a game is on the line, they simply ramp it up. This is the attitude that killed any chances the Toronto Raptors had and broke their spirits. James did the same thing to the Boston Celtics. They simply make it happen. One can see McDavid beginning to develop this same attitude. If McDavid can come to engage this quality more, the rest of the team will follow their example – not just their words.
No season can be lost and no lead too great to come back from. No series can be out of reach and no goal unattainable. We already know that to McDavid, no individual trophy is out of reach. This kind of example is inspiring.
The Keep Learning Lesson
The fourth leadership lesson LeBron James can teach is to keep learning. When James left the Cavaliers to join Pat Riley's Miami Heat, they not only won but they also learned. They carried those lessons back to Cleveland. Such learning was foundational for the success that came later.
If nothing else, 2017-18 was a learning year for Connor McDavid. What McDavid learned hardest was how debilitating losing and defeated expectations can be. These lessons can be leveraged into success, and 2018-19 could be the year to put those lessons into practice. Take a look at the video below to see how much of a student LeBron is of every game and every play. It's incredible when you see it back and it's something McDavid can adopt since they clearly have a mind for the game.
To Engage the Critics Lesson
The fifth leadership lesson LeBron James can teach is to engage critics head-on and bring them into the vision. Before James returned to the Cavs, they had never won a championship in their entire history. James had to bring everyone who counted (all the vocal critics) into the vision – even the Cavaliers' leadership. They had to make sure there were no bad feelings because grudges can cloud vision.
If there ever were a time to being Oilers' critics – including Oilers' fans – on board, it is now. Today, Oilers' fans don't know what to believe. Perhaps broken-hearted is too strong a word, but broken in spirit is not. It is time for McDavid to step up and enliven the vision of Oilers' fans again. The city could use such leadership; the fans could use such leadership; and, for sure, the team could use such leadership. This is the year to make it happen. We all know that Connor McDavid is a great player: but this is the year for them to further their skills as a leader.

The New York Times
Obama Will Speak in South Africa on Tolerance
WASHINGTON — He's been photographed kite-surfing with Richard Branson off Necker Island, relaxing on David Geffen's yacht in French Polynesia with Bruce Springsteen and Oprah Winfrey, river-rafting with their family in Bali and posing with a celebrity chef in Tuscany.
To those who have paid only casual attention to former President Barack Obama's foreign travels since they left the White House in January 2017, it can seem as if Mr. Obama has been on an extended vacation of the kind only the very rich can afford.
But the former president has also met quietly with groups of young people in New Zealand, Brazil, Indonesia and Singapore, as well as paying calls on foreign leaders, including Xi Jinping of China, Emmanuel Macron of France, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Malcolm Turnbull of Australia.
Now, Mr. Obama is inaugurating their most significant international project as an ex-president, with an announcement on Monday that the Obama Foundation plans to convene 200 young people this July in Johannesburg for five days of meetings, workshops and technical training.
At the same time, Mr. Obama will deliver a lecture to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela, whom they eulogized after their death five years ago by saying they “makes me want to be a better man.”
“It gives them an opportunity to lift up a message of tolerance, inclusivity and democracy at a time when there are obviously challenges to Mandela's legacy around the world,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama who still advises him.

On Friday, employees of BP Exploration Alaska discovered an uncontrolled gas leak in an oil and gas well on Alaska's North Slope, near the community of Deadhorse. Soon after, they determined that the well was also spraying a mist of crude oil.
BP reported the leak and formed a "unified command," which included responders from Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the North Slope Borough.
The well vented gas throughout the weekend. By Sunday, the crude was no longer spraying, and workers were able to activate a safety valve that reduced the pressure of the gas.
On Monday, nearly three days after the leak was found, ADEC announced the unified command had to managed to "kill" the well overnight and end the gas leak.
"The area impacted is limited to gravel," says Candice Bressler, spokesperson for ADEC. "There have been no reports of impacted wildlife." Oil droplets were found on about 1.5 acres of the well's drill pad, according to The Associated Press.
The community of Nuiqsut, 50 miles west of the site, had been notified of the incident, but was not evacuated.
"Responders determined that the well had 'jacked up,' or risen, approximately 3 – 4 feet; this vertical movement of the well caused the pressure gauge to break off and prevented operations from pumping into the well to kill it," ADEC reported.
BP began drilling at the massive Prudhoe Bay oil field in 1968. It has generated more than 12 billion barrels of oil, according to BP, and remains one of North America's largest oil fields.
The leak happened amid efforts to boost output from aging wells and reach new supplies in the North Slope's oil fields, reports Bloomberg:
"North Slope production rose to 565,000 barrels a day in March, its highest level since December 2013. That's still down by almost three-quarters from the peak of more than 2 million barrels in the late 1980s."
In a 2011 settlement with the Department of Justice, BP agreed to pay a $25 million civil penalty and carry out a "system-wide integrity management program" after it spilled more than 5,000 barrels of crude oil from its pipelines on Alaska's North Slope in 2006. Five years later, BP agreed to pay more than $20 billion in penalties for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Republican Congressman David Young is calling on the Trump Administration to provide Iowa with a quick answer on a proposed fix for the state's individual insurance market.
The state insurance commissioner has come up with a “stop gap” measure they believe will help up to 72,000 Iowans buy individual policies for 2018, but The Washington Post is reporting President Trump has directed federal officials to reject Iowa's waiver request.
During taping of the “Iowa Press” program that airs tonight on IPTV, Young said they hope the administration will approve the plan.
“It's been a slow walk and it's time to speed up. I hope it's not been undermined,” Young said. “It's time to act because people are suffering. Where do the 72,000 in Iowa go if they don't have access to the individual insurance market?”
Young said the Trump administration needs to give Iowa officials “certain flexibilities and some autonomy” or else the individual insurance market will collapse.
“Both sides of the aisle have come down to the conclusion that the current law is not stabilized and it's not working,” Young said. “…If the administration is balking on this for political expediency, I don't think that's right.”
A spokesperson for Governor Kim Reynolds said last night that the state has had no signal from the White House or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid that the state's ObamaCare waiver request will be rejected.
Young, who intends to seek reelection in 2018, today said “there's only so much they can control” and Young dismissed the idea that Trump's actions on this and other issues will be a liability on the campaign trail.
“When it comes to their policies, I take a look at them and I look at the third district. There are some things I agree with. Some things I disagree with,” Young said. “The president is the president. He'll be responsible for himself, but he's not my boss. I don't answer to him. I don't answer to Paul Ryan or the house majority leader or Mitch McConnell in the senate. I answer to the people of the third district.”
Seven Democrats have been campaigning in southwest Iowa's third congressional district for the chance to face Young in next year's General Election.
* Philippines up after 3 sessions of falls * Malaysia resumes trade after 2-day holiday * Thailand extends gain into third session By Karthika Suresh Namboothiri Feb 2 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets rose on Friday with the Philippines heading for its first gain in four sessions, while Singapore slipped for a third day in four. The Philippine Stock Exchange PSEI Index climbed as much as 0.6 percent, boosted by financials and industrials, but was on track to end the week lower for the first time in nine weeks. It has shed over 3 percent so far this week. BDO Unibank Inc jumped as much as 1.6 percent on Friday, while JG Summit Holdings rose as much as 2 percent. Thai shares extended their rise in to a third session, adding as much as 0.5 percent, on the back of gains in energy stocks and were on track to post their tenth straight weekly rise. Index heavyweight PTT Pcl jumped over 2 percent to a record high. U.S. oil rose for a third straight session after a survey showed strong compliance with output cuts by OPEC and others including Russia, offsetting concerns about surging U.S. production. Indonesian shares climbed nearly 1 percent, buoyed by financials with Bank Central Asia hitting a record high. For the week, they were slightly down after three consecutive weeks of gains. Singapore shares dropped as much as 0.7 percent to a two-week low, dragged by financials. Bankers United Overseas Bank shed 1.2 percent, while Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp declined 1 percent to a more than four-week low. Singapore shares have shed 0.7 percent so far this week, heading for their first weekly drop in six. Malaysian shares resumed trading on a sombre note after two days of holidays. Meanwhile, Asian shares stumbled as talk of policy tightening in Europe and expectations that inflation is set to gear higher drove up borrowing costs globally. Investors now await the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January, for clues on the strength of the labour market. Nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing 148,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent.

As data centers are called upon to handle an explosion of unstructured data fed into a variety of cutting-edge applications, the future for FPGAs looks bright.
That's because FPGAs, or field programmable gate arrays, are essentially chips that can be programmed, after manufacturing, to act as custom accelerators for workloads including machine-learning, complex data analysis, video encoding, and genomics – applications that have far-reaching consequences for communications, networking, health care, the entertainment industry and many other businesses.
Such applications lend themselves to parallel processing, an important feature of FPGAs, which can also be reconfigured on the fly to handle new features as the nature of these workloads evolve.
Now Xilinx, which for decades has vied with rival Altera (now part of Intel) for technical leadership in FPGAs, is unveling what it calls a new product category – the Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) – that, it says, goes far beyond the capabilities of current FPGAs.
What is an ACAP?
The first product range in the category is code-named Everest, due to tape out (have its design finished) this year and ship to customers next year, Xilinx announced Monday. Whether it's an incremental evolution of current FPGAs or something more radical is tough to say since the company is unveiling an architectural model that leaves out many technical details, like precisely what sort of application and real-time processors the chips will use.
The features that we do know about are consequential, though. Everest will incorporate a NOC (network-on-a-chip) as a standard feature, and use the CCIX (Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators) interconnect fabric, neither of which appear in current FPGAs.
Everest will offer hardware and software programmability, and stands to be one of the first integrated circuits on the market to use 7nm manufacturing process technology (in this case, TSMC's). The smaller the manufacturing process technology, the greater the transistor density on processors, which leads to cost and performance efficiency.
Though there is controversy over manufacturing process nomenclature and the relative merits of Intel's and TSMC's manufacturing processes, the basic idea is that 7nm is about half the geometry size of the current generation of FPGAs, with four times the performance per square millimeter. Everest devices will have up to 50 billion transistors, compared to, for example, Intel's (formerly Altera's) current Stratix 10 FPGAs, which use a 14nm manufacturing process and sport 30 billion transistors.
Xilinx Xilinx's first product range using its ACAP technology is codenamed Everest, developed in TSMC process technology.
“We really feel like this is a different product category,” said recently named Xilinx CEO Victor Peng. Xilinx has spent about a billion dollars over the past four years and committed 1,500 engineers to the project.
Xilinx currently claims that its FPGAs, due to their ability to be customized for different workloads, accelerate processing by 40 times for machine-learning inferencing, 10 times for video and image processing, and 100 times for genomics, relative to CPU- or GPU-based systems. ACAPs, it says, will further accelerate AI inferencing by 20 times, and 5G communications by 4 times over its current FPGA architecture.
FPGAs traditionally have offered an array of configurable logical blocks linked via programmable interconnects. Reconfiguration of FPGAs for years was done via Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), but chip developers have started tweaking the architecture of the devices to enable the use of higher level software programming languages.
Xilinx's recently released Zynq All Programmable SoC (system on a chip) joins the software programmability of the ARM-based processor that has been integrated into the product, with the hardware programmability of an FPGA.
“We've been transforming, but ACAP is the inflection point if you will,” Peng said. “Even though before, FPGAs were flexible and adaptable, the level of that is much higher and yes, we started more recently enabling people to develop more at the software level, but the extent to which we're gonna do it with this class of product is much higher. That makes this a quantum step over what we've seen before.”
Using high-level software programming languages
Xilinx says that software developers will be able to work with Everest using tools like C/C++, OpenCL, and Python. Everest also can be programmable at the hardware, register-transfer level (RTL) using HDL tools like Verilog and VHDL.
Karl Freund, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, sees Everest as more of an evolution of Xilinx's strategy rather than a radical step, but emphasizes that the advances in the hardware and software elements of Everest are significant.
“It's true it's a new category but it's not just the chip that makes it a new category – it's the chip, the software, the libraries and even the web development models," Freund said.
“They've invested a lot in software stacks, the so-called acceleration stacks that enable you to more quickly deploy FPGA solutions because they're basically providing some standardized libraries and tools and algorithms and IP blocks that you can just pick up and deploy on your FPGA,” they said.
In addition to an as-yet-unspecified, multicore SoC (system on a chip), Xlinx says that Everest will offer PCIe as well as CCIX interconnect support, multimode Ethernet controllers, on-chip control blocks for security and power management, and programmable I/O interfaces. It also includes different types of SerDes – transceivers that convert parallel data to serial data and vice-versa. Specifically, it will offer 33Gbps NRZ (non-return to zero), 58Gbps PAM-4 (pulse amplitude modulation) and 112G PAM-4 SerDes. Generally, the PAM mechanism offers more bandwidth than NRZ.
Certain Everest chips will also offer high bandwidth memory (HBM), or programmable ADC (analog-to-digital) and DAC (digital-to-analog) converters, Xilinx says.
Network on a Chip, coherent cache are key differentiators
Xilinx says that a key difference between FPGAs and ACAPs is the NOC, which connects the device's various subsystems such as multiple processors and I/O elements. Up to now FPGAs have not had system-level NOCs, and developers have had to essentially create the connection infrastructure through the chips' programmable logic. “You can still program the subsystems through programmable logic but in general, you wouldn't get the same performance characteristics,” Peng said.
Another key element is CCIX. “What is revolutionary is, it's cache coherent,” Freund said. “For the first time you'll be able to build a system with a cache-coherent accelerator using a standard network protocol, and that doesn't exist anywhere in the industry right now.”
CCIX is a set of specifications being developed by the the CCIX Consortium to solve the problem of cache coherence, or how to ensure that different CPUs don't clash when trying to modify the same memory space or work on stale copies of data.
A big target for Everest is AI. No one expects Everest to compete with the pure horsepower behind Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, which are being used to “train” terabyte-size data sets to work in mammoth, 100-level-deep, machine-learning neural networks.
But the adaptability of Everest, like traditional FPGAs, makes it ideal for “inferencing,” or actually putting the neural networks to use in real-life situations, Freund notes. That's because each level of a neural network should be processed with the least amount of precision possible, to save time and energy. Unlike CPUs, which have fixed precision, FPGAs can be programmed to process each level of a neural network, once its built, with the least precision suitable for that layer.
Edge devices are a primary target
And while Xilinx says its primary target is the data center, edge devices and IoT may ultimately be where Everest shines. Machine-learning applications will increasingly be incorporated into edge devices, which are extremely power-constrained relative to big servers, making them ideal candidates for FPGAs.
Microsoft, which was the first major cloud provider to announce the deployment of FPGAs for its public cloud infrastructure, last year gave the chips a big vote of confidence for their use in AI, announcing it would use FPGAs for its Project Brainwave deep-learning platform. It's using Stratix 10 FPGAs from Xilinx's nemesis, Intel/Altera, but this nevertheless helps cement the idea of using FPGAs for AI inferencing.
The continuing rivalry between Xilinx and Intel will play out as the companies move to smaller manufacturing process technology. Intel has already announced FPGAs code-named Falcon Mesa, to be built with Intel 10nm manufacturing technology, which some industry insiders say will provide equivalent transistor density to TSMC's 7nm process.
With Everest and possibly Falcon Mesa due out in 2019, it looks like FPGAs – or in Xilinx's case, ACAPs – will play a more important role in computing trends than they ever have.
RAJKOT: A brutal case of honour killing has come to light in the city with the arrest of two brothers who allegedly kidnapped and poisoned their 26-year-old divorcee sister over a suspected love affair, according to Times of India.
The detection of crime branch (DCB) on Wednesday arrested Biraen Vala and their brother Rajvir, sons of a well-known private financier Bisu Vala, for the murder of their sister Poonam. DCB officials said that the duo's three accomplices - Raghu Gida of Jasdan, Gautam Vala of Dadva village and Mahesh Giri of Junagadh - are still on the run. All five were charged with abduction, murder, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence.
H M Gadhvi, DCB police inspector, said Biren and Rajvir, along with three others abducted Poonam from their family home at Rashtriya Kala Kendra Society in the city on May 25 and took them to a farm in a village near Jasdan. "The brothers forcefully made Poonam drink poison which led to their death at the spot. Later, they even performed their last rites in order to destroy evidence," Gadhvi told media persons.
However, investigators started suspecting something fishy during the recording of the brothers' statements. On probing in detail, and questioning them again, it was revealed that they had killed Poonam.
Investigation by crime branch revealed that Poonam had recently divorced their husband after seven years of marriage in Mumbai and was living with their parents. "The main reason for murder was their alleged affair with some person who is yet to be identified," said a DCB official.
Police said that Poonam also had a verbal spat with their brothers over going abroad two days before they were murdered.
BOSTON -- Manager John Farrell tried to change pitchers from Addison Reed to Craig Kimbrel one pitch into Jacoby Ellsbury's at-bat with one out in the bottom of the ninth and a runner a second base at Yankee Stadium on Sunday.
But pitching coach Carl Willis already visited the mound to talk with Reed right before when Ellsbury was introduced. A manager/coach can't visit the mound twice during the same at-bat.
And so Reed stayed in and retired Ellsbury on a groundout to second base.
It's certainly rare to pull a pitcher in the middle of an at-bat -- and even more rare just one pitch in.
Farrell met with the recently-acquired setup man after the game.
"That was obviously a unique situation last night," Farrell said here at Fenway Park on Monday. "Kind of going back to the question before about getting them settled in here. I didn't want them leaving Yankee Stadium last night without at least sitting down with him, giving them some thoughts that went into that: the time of the game, the leverage of the spot. And I'm sure that was probably the first time he's maybe experienced it."
Farrell didn't explain why they changed their mind one pitch into Ellsbury's at-bat instead of going to Kimbrel to begin the at-bat.
"I was looking to get Craig in the game," Farrell said. "And unfortunately, the rule is what it is. I'm well aware of the rule as I addressed it after the game last night. But felt like I didn't want to leave that series without having Craig Kimbrel on the mound. You know what? They (Reed) gets Ellsbury out. And you see what took place after that."
Farrell said Reed was "understanding" during the conversation.
"In a short period of time, I've come to know Addison as a very direct guy. He's honest with himself," Farrell said. "He doesn't complicate matters by overthinking situations. Knows in those late-inning spots that there's little margin for error. And recognized some of the feedback I gave him, too, from my perspective."
Farrell wouldn't say if Reed was angry. But Reed shouted something after retiring Ellsbury.
"I don't know if we need to give the contents of the meeting, but I think it was a professional, good conversation," Farrell said.
Expect for Reed to pitch the eighth inning if the Red Sox have a lead in a close game here Monday vs. the Indians.
"He'd be the guy," Farrell said. "(Matt) Barnes is down today."
The Red Sox have looked at "quite a bit of video" from Reed's time with the Mets.
Reed threw a first-pitch slider inside to Ellsbury to fall behind 1-0 in the count right before Farrell tried to remove him.
"He's been such a premium strike thrower," Farrell said. "That's where a few of the sliders that have been held onto maybe a little bit late just to ensure they don't stay in the middle zone, particularly in that ballpark. And I think that probably had something to do with maybe the finish or where some of those sliders finished."
Reed allowed four runs without recording an out Friday to take the loss at Yankee Stadium.
"I think with any reliever, there's going to be some tentative performance or inconsistencies that do appear," Farrell said. "We just happened to run across a couple of them over the past couple of days. But still confidence in them and every guy that's in that bullpen. There will be high-leverage innings I'm sure and confident he'll pitch in."
Police in Winnipeg are searching for a man after an attempted abduction Friday. The suspect is described as being around 40-years-old with a medium build and balding hair. They were last seen wearing reading glasses, grey shirt and grey and orange jacket with blue jeans.
TORONTO (Reuters) - The driver accused of plowing a rental van into pedestrians in Toronto was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder at their first court appearance on Tuesday, but their motive remained a mystery.
The deadliest mass killing in Canada in decades has the hallmarks of other deadly vehicle assaults by Islamic State supporters, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday there was no reason to suspect any national security connection.
Suspect Alek Minassian, 25, entered a Toronto courtroom on Tuesday morning. Their head was shaved and they looked down as prosecutors charged them in the death of 10 pedestrians and injury of 15 others in the lunchtime attack.
Trudeau called on all Canadians to stand united with Toronto as flowers and scrawled messages in multiple languages piled up at a makeshift memorial in Toronto's north end, an ethnically diverse neighborhood of towering office buildings, shops, restaurants and homes.
“We cannot as Canadians choose to live in fear every single day as we go about our daily business,” Trudeau told reporters outside of parliament in Ottawa. “We need to focus on doing what we can and we must keep Canadians safe while we stay true to the freedoms and values that we all as Canadians hold dear.”
The prime minister said that, while it would take time before the motives of the attacker were understood, the incident had not changed the country's threat level or security preparations for a G7 summit in Quebec in June.
The Canadian flag was lowered to half-staff at parliament and at Toronto city hall.
Minassian, who was not previously known to authorities, attended a high school program where one classmate remembered them as “absolutely harmless.” [nL8N1S1074]
The suspect's two-story red-brick home in a suburb north of Toronto was a crime scene Tuesday, taped off and surrounded by police vehicles. Officers went in and out of the house.
The officer who apprehended Minassian was praised for making a peaceful arrest even as the suspect shouted “Kill me” and claimed to have a gun. [nL1N1S026N]

Canadians mourned as the victims began to be identified on Tuesday.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp identified one of the victims as Anne Marie D'Amico, an employee of asset manager Invesco Canada. In a statement, Invesco confirmed that one of its employees had been killed, but did not name them
The attack shook the usually peaceful streets of Toronto, a multicultural city with a population of 2.8 million. The city recorded 61 murders last year.
Downtown Toronto's iconic CN Tower, which is normally lit up in the evening, went dark on Monday evening.
The drama started at lunchtime on a warm spring day, when the driver drove their vehicle into the crowds. The street was soon covered in blood, empty shoes and bodies. [nL1N1S102I]

One person was transported to the hospital after a garbage truck struck a power pole on Johns Island Monday night.
The St. John's Fire Department says Main Road is closed between Patton Avenue and Humbert Road due to the accident.
The fire department said the road should be open shortly.
According to a report, emergency crews responded to the scene at 6:45 p.m. for an accident with entrapment.
"A garbage truck traveling on Main Road veered off the road and struck a power pole," St. John's Fire District officials said. "The garbage truck became entangled in the power lines and fire personnel waited for Berkeley Electric to neutralize power to the lines before extrication began."
Berkeley Electric is restoring power lines affected by the crash.
Units with the St. John's Fire District, Charleston County Rescue, Charleston County EMS and Charleston County Sheriffs Office responded.

(Reuters) - U.S. computer maker Dell Technologies Inc and business software provider VMware Inc have decided to explore options that could include a potential merger of the two companies, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
The move, which may not result in any deal, comes as Dell, the world's largest privately held technology company, seeks new avenues for growth following its debt-laden acquisition of data storage provider EMC Corp for $67 billion in 2016.
Dell plans to announce as early as Friday that it will review a possible reverse merger with VMware, as well as other alternatives, including an initial public offering or asset divestitures, the three sources said.
VMware plans to announce that it will form a special committee of board directors to consider a combination with Dell, according to the sources. VMware is 80 percent-owned by Dell, so the special committee is aimed at making any combination subject to approval by disinterested directors who will safeguard the interests of VMware minority shareholders, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Dell declined to comment, while VMWare did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dell is under pressure to boost its profitability after the EMC deal failed to deliver the cost savings and performance it projected, while higher component costs and a challenging data storage market have eroded its margins.

The Round Rock, Texas-based company has struggled with fierce competition in the storage market, as cloud-based rivals such as Amazon.com Inc's AWS and Microsoft Corp's Azure put pressure on prices. Dell's infrastructure chief, former EMC executive David Goulden, departed last fall, and the firm has since been working to reorganize its storage operations.
The PC market, which Dell CEO Michael Dell helped shape by founding Dell in 1984 as a college first-year student with $1,000 in savings, has remained stagnant due to the popularity of smart phones and tablets, shrinking by 0.2 percent in 2017, according to International Data Corporation.
A reverse merger would see VMware, which has a market capitalization of $51 billion, buy Dell, rather than Dell buy the minority stake in VMware it does not already own. A lockup provision prevents Dell from buying out VMware until September.
“Irrespective of whether VMware or Dell is the acquirer, we think the terms of trade would have to entail a premium to VMware minority shareholders,” UBS Securities LLC desk-based analyst Evren Ergin wrote in a sales commentary note on Thursday.
Another consideration for Dell in its deliberations is offering an eventual path to private equity firm Silver Lake to cash out on its investment in the company. Silver Lake helped bankroll Michael Dell's $24.9 billion deal in 2013 to take the company private and owns about 18 percent of the company.

The Woodstock Economic Development department announced its new interim manager for the small enterprise business centre on Tuesday.
Ronda Stewart will be taking over as interim manager at the Woodstock and Area Small Business Enterprise Centre, bringing with their six years of experience managing the Elgin/St. Thomas Small Business Enterprise Centre.
Before that, Stewart operated their own small business providing executive directors with organizational administration and bookkeeping support.
Stewart said that they were excited to bring their experience to this region.
“One of the main functions of the small business enterprise centre is to help new businesses and existing businesses with business planning and business planning review,” Stewart said. “One of the first obligations that I will be doing when I get there is actual core business planning for the centre itself. Putting together a one and two-year plan of some of the business activities and supports that we'll be providing to Woodstock and area.”
The strategy for the two-year business plan will involve reaching out to the business community and community partners in a direct way, Stewart said, as well as leveraging resources and enhancing the mentorship program.
“We have a very small mentorship base right now,” they said. “I was to actually establish a very strong mentorship base.
“We will be working with successful business owners and community leaders who have certain skill sets,” they added, “and when working with new or existing business owners who could use some finessing in that area, we find often that when you're working with other business owners or receiving mentorship from someone who is successful in that area, the enthusiasm of the person receiving the training goes up.”
In addition, the centre is also hosting an International Women's Day event in March and Stewart said they are also working on other projects as well.

After being taunted by lake-effect snow, folks around Mid-Michigan finally picked up some light snow over the weekend, enough to give many areas their first white coating of the season.
If that snow over the weekend wasn't enough, we have another opportunity for snow today, with additional accumulation expected today and tonight, hopefully providing some more insurance for a possible white Christmas.
Today & Tonight
While we are off to a dry start this morning, keep an eye out for slick areas on your morning commute as we had periods of snow and even freezing drizzle last evening. Many accidents were reported around the area, so it wouldn't be a bad idea to add a few extra minutes to that commute today.
Temperatures are generally in the teens and lower 20s this morning, but thankfully most areas are seeing light winds so the wind chill difference isn't making things much worse. However, still prepare for wind chills in the teens and lower 20s for much of the day, with highs only reaching the middle and upper 20s in most areas.
The morning commute should be dry, but light snow will be approaching our western areas around 9-10 AM this morning, spreading eastward late morning into early afternoon. Accumulations out of this round of snow, should remain on the lighter side.
Snow continues later on this evening, and it's in the evening hours of tonight where we may see a few heavier bands of snow. The best chances for the heavier bands will be near the I-69 corridor and areas to the south near M-59. If traveling this evening, allow plenty of time, especially in this region.
Snow persists through the overnight period, eventually winding down by the Tuesday morning commute. By Tuesday morning, accumulations in most areas will total around 1-3" of snow, but with some of those heavier bands possibly moving into the southern counties later tonight, we'll allow the possibility for some higher totals, and make the zone 1-4".
Overnight lows tonight will fall down into the teens, and winds will be taking a more northwesterly turn by Tuesday morning. There will likely be wind chills in the single numbers, possibly below zero in a few areas as we kick off the second day of the workweek.
Below, we have a more specific snowfall outlook. (Note: Not visible on the app).

A day after pressing the Department of Education for answers about a large tent that collapsed during a science fair, we took our questions to the company that set up that tent.
Was it set up properly, and should it have been set up at all?
Three children were injured when the tent collapsed on Kapiolani Community College's Great Lawn.
Officials with the DOE and KCC told us Monday that they did not expect the winds to be that strong, even though other outdoor events were canceled in anticipation of the storm.
KHON2 spoke with the owner of the tent company, who was as surprised as officials with the DOE and KCC.
Dan Kushner owns Hawaii Tents and Events. They say their crew set up the 40-by-100-foot tent Friday afternoon, doubling the number of stakes on each pole because they knew about the strong wind and heavy rain in the forecast.
“With those types of reinforcements, how strong of a wind gust can that take?” KHON2 asked.
“We're conservative, so if we're expecting winds in excess of 35 miles an hour, gusts in excess of 40, 45, let's say, we wouldn't put up the tent,” Kushner said.
Our Friday night forecast on KHON2 News did call for wind gusts of up to 40 miles per hour.
Kushner adds that if the tent is already up and there's a question if conditions are safe, they would contact the client — in this case the DOE — about possibly taking it down.
“Did it ever come to that point?” KHON2 asked.
“No, not in this case,” Kushner replied. “I mean, it was rainy and there was a lot of rain, I understand that, but it wasn't windy. It wasn't windy to that extent,” Kushner said.
We went to the National Weather Service to find out more about what caused the strong winds. Forecaster Derek Wroe says the conditions were unusual.
The winds were from the southwest instead of the normal northeasterly winds, and also from higher elevations.
“That's why people would say, ‘Wow, the wind hit all of a sudden,' because they really did hit all of a sudden,” Wroe said. “That wind was high up in the atmosphere and it was transported down to the surface and it hits the surface and spreads out, and it could produce quite a strong wind gust when it does that.”
Wroe says wind gusts did exceed more than 40 miles per hour. While there was no wind advisory, they say when there's a possibility for thunderstorms, people should be wary of doing anything outside.
“If you have outdoor activities, we had a flash flood watch out. We also were calling for thunderstorms in the forecast. Right there, that means that people should have an eye on the sky,” they said.
The National Weather Service adds that thunderstorms also mean possible lightning strikes, which is another reason not to hold outdoor event during that time.

Fifteen persons in Uttar Pradesh have been killed in two road accidents. Ten were killed in Mirzapur district on Monday, while five from a wedding party died late last night in a bus-car collision in Mathura.
Besides the 10 killed in Mirzapur, over a dozen were seriously injured when a truck and a tractor collided head on near the Agriculture Science Centre, a police officer said.
The condition of at least five of the injured is critical. They have been rushed to Varanasi, Station House Officer (SHO) of Madihaan, K.K. Singh said.
The tractor was returning from a family function after a head tonsuring ritual from Sheetla Dhaam, Chunar. All the deceased belong to Gadhwa village. The police fear that the death toll might rise.
In other accident in Mathura late on Sunday night, five persons have been killed when the car headed to a wedding ceremony was hit by the speeding bus carrying a marriage party in the Naujheel area, the police said.
A motorcycle with two riders then rammed into the bus from behind.
Four persons died on the spot. Another died at a primary health centre. Two others in critical condition were rushed to the Mathura district hospital.
The collision was so huge it took a lot of effort to extricate the mangled car from the bus, a police officer said.
VERMILION, Alta. -
Vermilion Marauders' Kyle Theiss has earned a place in the Football Alberta Top 100 U18 player list, following their tryout for the U18 team.
“I am excited and am still in shock. There was quite a bit of linemen, 50 others, there trying out for the U18 team.”
The 16-year-old offensive lineman tried out for Team Alberta U18, along with 360 others for the inaugural Team Alberta Super Weekend. Since they were identified as one of the top players, Theiss will be moving onto the next step of the selection process.
Team Alberta U18 is expected to represent the province at the 2017 Football Canada Cup in Nova Scotia in July 2018.
Last year, Theiss was honoured at the Marauders Banquet with Offensive Lineman of the Year, Defensive Line-man, and Most Dedicated Player. In 2015, they were awarded Rookie of the Year.
“This is a big deal, hasn't happened in a long time for Vermilion football players,” said Marauders Head Coach Lorne Maier in news release. “He's worked hard to get to this level; training several times a week with a professional trainer in Lloydminster and attending player camps on the weekends and throughout the winter.”
After a bout in hockey for four years, Theiss has dedicated nine years to football saying it was their ability to adapt to the sport right away and the teamwork aspect that has kept them around.
“The team work in it, you are not by yourself. You are with 11 other people with you on the field and you all have to do your job in order to make a play and hopefully succeed. You are relying on other people and yourself.”
Theiss, who donned the number 64 as a Marauders' player, said they hope they can stick with the number since they transferred schools this semester, as their dad played high school ball with the same number.
“I transferred schools this semester to better my academic marks under the Saskatchewan curriculum,” they said, of their transfer to Lloydminster Composite High School.
From there, Theiss hopes to pursue computer sciences in post-secondary, while looking to get scouted by a university.
For right now, Theiss said they are looking to push themselves even harder to keep their ranking and prove they deserve to be on the list.

Continuing in a series of firsts in the thawing relationship between Pakistan and India, the recently escalated tension over the LoC might just see a welcome reconciliation as the Directors General of Military Operations of Pakistan and their counterpart in India have made sincere overtures to restore the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) and Working Boundary (WB). The pact comes as a major relief for civilians living in border colonies, thousands of whom have been displaced due to the fierce cross-border firings.
Where the recurring violations over the LoC owing to the hardline adopted by Modi's administration had instigated violence and atrocity in the occupied region with over a 100 dead during the last year and half on the Pakistani side, the accord brokered comes through the much advocated initiative of opening channels of communication. A testament to Pakistan's consistent effort at brokering peace, the agreement was reached during a hotline conversation, on a Pakistani initiative. Given that the previous DGMO level talk held last month had ended in routine blame-shifting, with India stating that ‘firing by Indian troops was carried out in response to support given by the Pakistan Army to armed terrorists' and that it will continue its heavy retaliatory aggression, the current exchange is a refreshing change from the Pak-India finger pointing rhetoric, where the two contemporaries were unanimous in their statement committing to a mutual understanding, and heralds a much awaited period of amenable relations between the two neighbours over the issue of Kashmir.
Where it is regrettable that existing mechanisms of hotline contacts and border flag meetings were seldom used before, it is heartening to see both sides using all channels of communication to work towards easing tensions along the LoC and mediate the recent exchange of hostilities.
Recently heartening positive steps taken by the two sides include exchange of prisoners and progress on other bilateral agreements, besides a meeting of the Indus Water Commission and scheduled meetings of Coast Guard teams, all of which can slowly redefine and temper the general level of trust, and allow for a more amicable bilateral engagement.
Where conjecture about a nod from Pakistan's National Security Committee, a morphing political dynamic on India's side and groundwork towards cooperation inspired by the Daulat-Durrani memoir all may have contributed to the evolution of this compromise, the fact remains that in the wake of the violence and spiraling human tragedy that had been set ablaze in Kashmir, any tempering of Pak-Indian ties that can allow for peace and stability in the disputed region should be celebrated and encouraged.
LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Newcastle captain Jonjo Shelvey apologised to their teammates after their red card for a stamp on Tottenham Hotspur's Dele Alli left them with 10 men for almost all the second half in the 2-0 Premier League defeat at St James' Park on Sunday.
"Jonjo apologised to the team after the game," said manager Benitez.
TV replays showed Shelvey deliberately trod on Alli's ankle in full view of referee Andre Marriner after the Tottenham player failed to give them the ball.
The referee immediately gave the midfielder a straight red card.
Shelvey will now serve an automatic three-match ban, missing games against Huddersfield Town, West Ham United and Swansea City as Newcastle seek to re-establish themselves in England's top tier after promotion.
Shelvey's moment of madness changed the course of the game with Newcastle still level.
It appeared even more ill-advised because Newcastle had already lost two players injured in a hectic first half hour. The incident happened in the 48th minute after Alli had been fouled by Isaac Hayden.
Shelvey went to get the ball from Alli and, apparently annoyed when the Spurs midfielder knocked it away, stepped on Alli's ankle.
Benitez admitted Shelvey's red card changed the match but said the stamp was not as dangerous as a Harry Kane tackle on Florian Lejeune, for which they were booked.
"It was difficult from the beginning. We had to adapt things [after injuries]. The red card changed everything. I think we were defending well. We have to improve. We had our chances but we missed them," Benitez said.
"The Harry Kane tackle was worse than this one. It's more dangerous. We lost one player from that. We made a mistake, but I think maybe someone has to analyse these things to see what's more dangerous."
Alli did not want to talk about the incident when they were interviewed by Sky TV after the game. "It was one of those things.  They are a great player and I am sure they are going to be disappointed," they said.
"I have been called up a couple of times for my own temper but it is important we kept our cool."
The red card is the third of the 25-year-old Shelvey's controversial career and follows the five-match ban and 100,000 pounds ($130,110.00) fine they received last season for racially abusing Wolverhampton Wanderers' Moroccan-born player Romain Saiss.
Five years ago they were also involved in a touchline argument with former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson when they were sent off while playing for Liverpool for a two-footed lunge on Jonny Evans.
Conservation officers had to euthanize approximately one bear in every 30 complaints.
British Columbia's Conservation Officer Service reports more than 20,000 conflicts between humans and wildlife around the province between January and October of this year.
Environment Ministry spokesperson Mike Badry says about 14,000 of those complaints involve confrontations with black bears.
They say 469 bruins, or approximately one bear in every 30 complaints, had to be destroyed.
Spring and early summer produced the greatest number of complaints about bears, but Badry says the confrontations have tailed off, making 2017 an average year for complaints about wildlife.
RELATED: Bear complaints nearly double across B.C.
They warn that confrontations could increase because bears are now focused on finding as much food as possible before they hibernate.
Homeowners are urged to secure all food sources, such as garbage or compost and to ensure fruit trees are picked clean.

“These bears are trying to put on weight for denning throughout the winter, so they are highly motivated to find food,” Badry says.
“That is where we really put the emphasis on attractant management.”

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A newspaper report alleging Danske Bank laundered up to $8.3 billion through its Estonian branch could prompt Denmark's financial watchdog to open a new investigation into the bank, the country's business minister said on Wednesday.

Shares in Danske Bank fell more than 3 percent after Danish daily Berlingske alleged the bank's Estonian branch was a conduit for suspicious money flows worth at least 53 billion Danish crowns ($8.3 billion), more than twice the amount previously reported.
The daily said it was in possession of bank statements for 20 companies that held accounts with the Estonian branch over various periods from 2007 to 2015.
“It is too soon to make any conclusions about the extent of potential money laundering in Estonia,” Danske Bank's head of group compliance, Anders Meinert Jorgensen, said in an email.
“Therefore, we have not published our own figures or heeded speculation on the extent of this case. But we have indicated on several occasions that the extent appears to be somewhat bigger than what has previously been reported,” they said.
Danske Bank has admitted to flaws in its anti money-laundering controls in Estonia and launched its own investigation into the case, which is due to present its findings in September. But Denmark's new business minister said the bank's own investigation might not be enough.
“It looks like a lot of money has been made on illegal activities. This is very serious, and I think we need clarity about it,” Rasmus Jarlov said, according to several local media.
“The FSA (Financial Supervisory Authority) is reviewing the new information that Berlingske reported last night. At the same time, the FSA is in contact with the Estonian counterpart to discuss possible actions in light of the new significant information,” they said.
Danske Bank says it has closed down the concerned non-resident accounts at its Estonian branch and is doing all it can to prevent criminal abuse.
Denmark's FSA said in May major flaws in Danske Bank's money laundering controls in Estonia made it possible for its branch there to be used for criminal activity, and the bank reacted too slowly when it was made aware of the weaknesses.

NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict seeking to separate religion, caste and other issues from politics, the Supreme Court, by a majority verdict, Monday held as “corrupt” the practice of candidates appealing for votes on the basis of these identities included not only them but their agents and voters.
In a marked departure from the view held in the 1995 “Hindutva” judgment that the term ‘his' used in Section 123 (3) of the Representation of the Peoples Act meant the religion, caste, etc of candidates only, a seven-judge bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur, by a majority of 4:3, held Monday that any appeal for votes on these grounds would amount to “corrupt practice.”
The court held that the provisions of the RP Act, which say that seeking vote by a candidate in the name of “his” religion, caste, race, religion and language in the election law, included candidates, their agents and voters also.
“An appeal in the name of religion, race, caste, community or language is impermissible under the RP Act, 1951 and would constitute a corrupt practice sufficient to annul the election in which such an appeal was made regardless whether the appeal was in the name of the candidate's religion or the religion of the election agent or that of the opponent or that of the voter's,” the CJI, who concurred with majority verdict written by Justice M B Lokur, said.
“So read together, and for maintaining the purity of the electoral process and not vitiating it, sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the RP Act must be given a broad and purposive interpretation thereby bringing within the sweep of a corrupt practice any appeal made to an elector by a candidate or their agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or their election agent to vote or refrain from voting for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate on the ground of the religion, race, caste, community or language of (i) any candidate or (ii) their agent or (iii) any other person making the appeal with the consent of the candidate or (iv) the elector,” said the majority view, also shared by Justices S A Bobde and L Nageswara Rao.
Justice Chandrachud, writing the minority verdict, said: “We hold that there is no necessity for this court to take a view at variance with what has been laid down. The ‘his' in Section 123(3) does not refer to religion, race, caste, community or language of the voter. ‘His' is to be read as referring to the religion, race, caste, community or language of the candidate in whose favour a vote is sought or that of another candidate against whom there is an appeal to refrain from voting.”
The verdict came on a batch of petitions including the one filed by Abhiram Singh whose election as an MLA in 1990 on BJP ticket from Santacruz Assembly seat in Mumbai was set aside by the Bombay High Court.
Justice Lokur, writing for the majority, considered “simultaneous and contemporaneous amendments” made in the election law and insertion of Section 153A (promoting enmity in different groups) in the IPC to highlight the intention of the legislation that it wanted to curb use of religion, castes etc in election and otherwise.
The bench said that instead of literal, there should be purposive and broad interpretation of the RP Act provision. “The Representation of the Peoples Act is a statute that enables us to cherish and strengthen our democratic ideals. To interpret it in a manner that assists candidates to an election rather than the elector or the electorate in a vast democracy like ours would really be going against public interest,” Justice Lokur said.
Quoting Winston Churchill, the bench said if the electoral law needed to be “understood, interpreted and implemented in a manner that benefits the ‘little man' (voter), as mentioned by the British Prime Minister, then there has to be purposive interpretation of the term ‘his' religion etc used in the Act.”
“There is no doubt in our mind that keeping in view the social context in which sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the Act was enacted and today's social and technological context, it is absolutely necessary to give a purposive interpretation to the provision rather than a literal or strict interpretation as suggested by counsel for the appellants, which, as they suggested, should be limited only to candidate's religion or that of their rival candidates,” it said.
CAPE TOWN - Another seam-friendly wicket stacks the odds overwhelmingly in favour of hosts South Africa when they take on Sri Lanka in the second Test at Newlands, starting on Monday. The middle contest in a three-match series comes just two days after South Africa completed a 206-run victory at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth in the Boxing Day test. That surface was supposedly the closest Sri Lanka would get on their tour to conditions that would allow spin spearhead Rangana Herath to make an impact.
Even then, it proved a contest where the home side were in firm control, though the visitors did provide some dogged resistance at times. At Newlands, the bowling trio of Kyle Abbott, Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada will again be looking to dominate the batsmen, with captain Faf du Plessis insisting three seamers would be enough, even if it does put their stamina to the test with just two free days between matches. "The seam attack has proven we can do it with three," they said after the first test success. "The key is obviously not to have anyone breaking down." Last year's New Year's test at Newlands saw South Africa battered by Ben Stokes' record-breaking 258 from 198 balls as they lost a home series to England and their place as the top test side in the International Cricket Council rankings. But, even without talismanic AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn, South Africa have since beaten New Zealand and Australia and set their target on a much improved 2017 in which they will go to England and then host Bangladesh and India.
Sri Lanka are likely to make changes to strengthen their batting line-up with Upul Tharanga expected to replace Kusal Perera at number three. Defeat in Port Elizabeth ended a run of five successive test victories for Sri Lanka, whose last home series was a convincing whitewash of Australia in mid-year but they remain unconvincing on the road.
SOUTH AFRICA (POSSIBLE): Dean Elgar, Stephen Cook, Hashim Amla, JP Duminy, Faf du Plessis (capt), Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wk), Vernon Philander, Kyle Abbott, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada.
SRI LANKA (POSSIBLE): Kaushal Silva, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhananjaya de Silva, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews (capt), Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Kusal Perera, Rangana Herath, Lahiru Kumara, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep.

Jorge Sampaoli and their Argentina coaching staff were noticeable omissions from a thank-you message posted by Sergio Aguero on Instagram. Argentina crashed out of Russia 2018 courtesy of a 4-3 last-16 defeat to France on Saturday to compound a poor tournament. Aguero was dropped for the clash against Les Bleus, but did come off the bench to score late in the game. They took the time to thank their family and supporters of the national team, but Sampaoli was not included in their message. Writing on Instagram, Aguero said: "It is time to thank my son, my family and my friends who accompanied me every day. Those who with great effort came to Russia to encourage us. To all those who from Argentina and many countries supported us with feeling and passion. And above all my colleagues who are the best in the world for leaving their soul in every game. Also to the doctors, physios, props and chefs that are part of a great team. To continue fighting always and together. I love you Argentina."
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  A suspect in the surprise-attack shooting deaths of two men in Kansas City, Missouri, is now charged in a woman's killing.
Prosecutors on Friday charged 22-year-old Fredrick Demond Scott of Kansas City with first-degree murder and armed criminal action in the shooting death of 64-year-old Karen Harmeyer of Grandview.
The indictment didn't include details of the death but KCTV reports an officer was called in July to investigate a dead body. Once the officer arrived, witnesses told them about Harmeyer, who lived in woods behind a church.
The officer entered the campsite and found their decomposed body inside a tent.

Scott previously was charged in two killings and is a person of interest in three others. All those victims were older white men. Scott is black.
The men were shot in surprise attacks, some near recreation trails.
