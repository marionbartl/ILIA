Hello Everyone!
This week we talk about After Dark Twitter, the whys, the hows, and the what not to-dos.
AD Twitter can be a great place for you to engage yourself -- and others -- in kinks, fetishes, and roleplay and can expand your sexual wheelhouse. That being said, there is a social contract involved when you engage in this type of activity, both as a "producer" and a "consumer".
We discuss how to interact with people in a way that portrays you in a good light and allows you to embrace the fun, sexy side of the fandom. We also talk about the risks and ways to mitigate your naked body becoming a public attraction.
We also have a listener question about how to move on after the end of a possibly unhealthy relationship.
For more information, including a list of topics by timestamp, see our Show Notes for this episode.
Thanks and, as always, be well!
We've reported on the impressive growth of German sneaker company adidas multiple times already this year, but not even the $5 billion USD in sales forecast comes close to the news unveiled today by NDP Group's Matt Powell. Announced within a series of footwear-related tweets, Powell not only announced further sales growth for the Three Stripes but also confirmed that adidas has overtaken Jordan as the #2 brand in the United States for sports footwear — an achievement they never thought they would see in their lifetime.
Arguably Kanye West's biggest critic and an avid believer that the “Kanye Effect” doesn't play a large role in adidas's growth, Powell highlights the Tubular Shadow and Superstar as August's top sellers for adi. We'll have to wait until the holiday season for the YEEZY BOOST 350 V2 “Beluga 2.0” to see whether or not everything holds true but for now, we can play The Life of Pablo‘s “Facts (Charlie Heat Version)” and say “Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman.”

Democrats on the House Oversight and Judiciary committees criticized Republicans for doing too little, too late in response to a series of political crises that put the Trump administration on its heels over the last week.
All Democratic members of the two committees wrote a letter to the Republican leadership of those committees to ask for a full investigation into whether President Trump is trying to block an investigation into Russia's interference with the election, and possible ties to Trump.
Republican leaders indicated support for an effort to obtain an FBI memo that reportedly describes Trump's prior effort to get the FBI to end its investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn. But Democrats said Republicans haven't moved quickly enough.
"Although Chairman [Jason] Chaffetz recently sent a letter to the Department of Justice Inspector General, we believe that response is anemic — especially for the Oversight Committee, which claims to be the premiere investigative body in the House of Representatives — and particularly in comparison to the multiple 'emergency' hearings they called and the unilateral subpoenas they issued as part of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton," they wrote.
"We are concerned that the continued failure of House Republicans to take action in the face of this onslaught of allegations will cause significant damage to the faith that the American people have in the credibility and integrity of our committees and the House of Representatives," the wrote. "We have a solemn obligation under the Constitution to act as a check on the Executive Branch and to hold President Trump accountable. It is time to do our job."
Democrats used their letter to ask Chaffetz's oversight committee to immediately subpoena the White House for documents related to the firing of Flynn.

Just in case you're wondering, a thing called a "fecal transplant" exists, and saves lives. Like most terrible medical phenomena, we can blame poop transplants on Purell moms and the antibiotic-resistant "superbugs" they have wrought.
Warning: The following true medical story is heinously disgusting.
An intestinal superbug called C-diff causes diarrhea so debilitating that the world's most powerful antibiotics cannot treat it. But some doctors have had success with a creative new medical procedure. Take it away, AP:
Now a small but growing number of doctors are trying a last-ditch treatment: Using good bacteria to fight off the bad by transplanting stool from a healthy person into the sick person's colon.
15,000 people die of C-diff every year, and though only a few dozen fecal transplants have been documented in medical journals, the breakthrough is exciting enough (or, uh, weird enough) to have the gastroenterology world buzzing. Fecal transplants function "like an organ transplant minus the anti-rejection drugs": Bacteria from the healthy poop colonize the unhealthy colon and end up vanquishing the unhealthy bacteria. And now, the grossest part of all: How fecal transplants are performed.
There's no one method. Brandt insists on a list of tests to make sure the donor doesn't have diseases such as hepatitis or HIV, or intestinal parasites. Then the donor, usually a close relative, brings in a fresh stool sample that Brandt liquefies and essentially drips into the patient's colon during a routine colonoscopy.
And that is the story of how a gross punchline from Me and You and Everyone We Know became a great medical breakthrough. [AP, image via Konstantin Chagin/Shutterstock]
Printing is an easy task for the web developer, you just want a pure HTML and CSS layout with simple body structure and you will be done.
Even if you work with PDF format it's a little bit harder but there are many PHP libraries to help you end this job, but this all about normal A4 printing, so what about thermal printing.
In the last project I had a task where the client wants to print bills receipt , first it was A4 printing papers then they asked me to design bills as a thermal printing which I don't know about, after googling I found two ways to do it, one of them I choose to do the task, let's see why?
Thermal printing PHP library
The first try was -- library, which is the most popular PHP library to print thermal receipts directly, it's supports various devices like ------, but to get it works with your device directly you need to tie it with your system with the following steps (steps with Windows 10) only :
1- Add the printer.
3- Share the printer to the network and rename it to a specific name As example (webeasystep)
4- Make a printing test from terminal (Aka Command line) with this code
php foo.php > testfile print /D:"\\%COMPUTERNAME%\YOUR-PRINTER-NAME" testfile
5- Download the PHP receipt printer library in the localhost, rename it to “print”, open example/interface/windows-usb.php which proper for Windows system and USB cable (also you can choose the proper file for your system and cable type).
6- Change the $connection variable from null to your printer name as an example (webeasystep), by doing this you will tie the printer with the library to take printing orders throughout the network.
7- Go to the URL localhost/print/example/interface/windows-usb.php
When opening the URL it will print instantly!!

Thermal printing throughout pdf
To Print invoice from pdf in codeigniter, you can use any pdf library to convert HTML to pdf then try to print from pdf with some settings, in this tutorial I will focus on MPDF library because I prefer to use it, for more info I recommend visiting this tutorial using MPDF to convert HTML to pdf.
Now let's create the receipt or the invoice with paper size that fit Thermal printer
To create this pdf you want to create a function in your controller
function index() { // boost the memory limit if it's low ;) ini_set('memory_limit', '256M'); // load library $this->load->library('pdf'); $pdf = $this->pdf->load(); // retrieve data from model or just static date $data['title'] = "items"; $pdf->allow_charset_conversion=true; // Set by default to TRUE $pdf->charset_in='UTF-8'; // $pdf->SetDirectionality('rtl'); // Set lang direction for rtl lang $pdf->autoLangToFont = true; $html = $this->load->view('content/mpdf', $data, true); // render the view into HTML $pdf->WriteHTML($html); // write the HTML into the PDF $output = 'itemreport' . date('Y_m_d_H_i_s') . '_.pdf'; $pdf->Output("$output", 'I'); // save to file because we can exit(); }
Then you should create a view file with content like this
<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="ar"> <!-- <html lang="ar"> for arabic only --> <head> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"> <title>Express Wash Customer Invoice</title> <style> @media print { @page { margin: 0 auto; /* imprtant to logo margin */ sheet-size: 300px 250mm; /* imprtant to set paper size */ } html { direction: rtl; } html,body{margin:0;padding:0} #printContainer { width: 250px; margin: auto; /*padding: 10px;*/ /*border: 2px dotted #000;*/ text-align: justify; } .text-center{text-align: center;} } </style> </head> <body onload="window.print();"> <h1 id="logo" class="text-center"><img src='<?= base_url() ?>global/site/logo.jpg' alt='Logo'></h1> <div id='printContainer'> <h2 id="slogan" style="margin-top:0" class="text-center">Cleaning Company</h2> <table> <tr> <td>Invoice Num</td> <td><b>#59867</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Created At</td> <td><b><?= date("d-m-Y H:i:s", time()); ?><br></b></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Client Name</td> <td><b>John Cena</b></td> </tr> </table> <p class="text-center"><img src="<?= base_url() ?>global/site/qr.png" alt="QR-code" class="left"/></p> <hr> <table> <tr> <td><b>Service Type</b></td> <td><b>Price</b></td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><hr></td></tr> <tr> <td><b>Clean Cars</b></td> <td><b>15.7 USD</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td> eco badge for waterless car washThe service at Detailing Knights is not only unmatched, it is also mobile, waterless and environmentally friendly. </td> <td></td> </tr> </table> <hr> <table> <tr> <td><b>Service Fee</b></td> <td><b>15.7 USD</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Discount</b></td> <td><b>1.7 USD</b></td> </tr> <tr> <td><b>Net Value</b></td> <td><b>14 USD</b></td> </tr> </table> <hr> </div> </body> </html>
Final result!!
Why I prefer PDF To Print Thermal receipts?
I like this way for many reasons, it is a simple way because you just need HTML CSS code structure no more but with the other way you should handle system settings, share network issues, devices driver compatibility, then if your language is RTL language or UTF-8 you should handle encoding for this language.
another problem I faced when work with the first way, the lack of flexibility in the browser printing, on the despite the pdf printing in your pc has much flexibility to change scale, zoom and other options as you like.
finally, it is my opinion and it is up to you, I just put them here to help you make the right choice

"Canada is one of the richest countries in the world," Redsky said. "This should not be happening."
Residents have been lobbying for years for what they call a permanent Freedom Road into the community. Public support and pressure has been growing among multi-faith groups, social justice activists and the business community.
The City of Winnipeg, the Manitoba and federal governments have put up $1 million each for a design study, which is to be completed in January. An all-weather road is expected to cost $30 million, shared by the three levels of government.
Winnipeg has said it would help pay for construction, but only the provincial NDP government has committed to earmarking cash in its upcoming budget.
The federal NDP and Liberal party have promised in the current election campaign to fund Ottawa's share of road construction if victorious in the Oct. 19 election.
Redsky said they hope the United Nations can increase pressure on Canada and Winnipeg to do what's right for the people of Shoal Lake 40.
"Once we get road access to our community, we hope to push for a water treatment plant and push for economic development, which we desperately need."
Amanda Klasing, senior researcher with the New-York-based Human Rights Watch, said Shoal Lake 40 is one of four Ontario First Nations that will be studied in depth for their report to the United Nations committee.
No conclusions have been reached yet, they said.
"There has been a lot of public focus on the water advisories and concerns, but there certainly are sanitation issues ... that I haven't seen reported as widely," Klasing said.

Hopefully you checked out the videos I posted this morning in the Six Around The Web post of Pittsburgh Steelers defensive in Ziggy Hood, who is currently working out this off-season at Outer Limits Sports Performance in Pittsburgh. Hood, who has long been known as a workout warrior, is entering their fourth season in the league and quite a bit is expected out of them at left defensive end this year.
The folks at Outer Limits passed along some info to me today on the transformation that Hood has made since working out there and you can see the before and after photos below that were pulled off of their website. According to the info they passed along on the blog, there were 29 days between the before and after shots which was from phase one, which ran from March to April. Hood reportedly dropped their body fat from 24% to 18% during that time span and their weight went from 305 to 307 pounds. They lost 18 pounds of fat and gained 20 pounds of muscle.
Reportedly Hood is starting phase four this week and will continue to train at Outer Limits until July 27th, which is right before training camp gets underway in Latrobe this year. During the OTA practices this off-season, Hood reportedly has been practicing while wearing a weight belt in addition.
Hood has made 23 starts in their first three seasons in the league and has a combined 59 tackles, 39 of which were solo to go along with 5.5 sacks. If the photo below is from phase one, it will be interesting to see the complete transformation shots after they are done training this off-season.

New Purdue tight ends coach Terry Malone oversees conditioning drills Monday inside the Mollekopf Center. (Photo: Mike Carmin/ Journal & Courier) Story Highlights Terry Malone is Purdue's offensive coordinator, replacing John Shoop
Malone has been an offensive coordinator at Michigan and Bowling Green
Malone will continue to coach tight ends
“I like to see us play a really fast-paced game,” Malone said
For the first time in 18 years, Terry Malone has the opportunity to spend extended time with their family and enjoy the holiday season without worrying about football practice or preparing for the next game.
That doesn't mean he'll completely put aside their new responsibilities.
“The mind will not stop churning,” said Malone, who was named Purdue's offensive coordinator Tuesday by head coach Darrell Hazell.
Once Christmas is over, Malone begins the task of trying to build off the pieces already in place and establish an identity for an offense that has endured quarterback changes and numerous struggles the last three years.
Malone replaces John Shoop, who was fired one day after the loss to Indiana. Malone will continue to coach tight ends, a position they were hired for in February.
Will this be the same offense of the last three years?
“To tear everything apart and start over again would be a waste of really good work and time that we've put into it,” Malone said. “There are going to be a lot of the same principles to what we've done, but there certainly will be some additions we feel as though maybe give us a better opportunity to put the ball in our playmakers hands.”
Malone will emphasize becoming a fundamentally sound offense, anchored by an aggressive and tough offensive line, and protecting the football. Last season, the Boilermakers attempted to play a fast-paced style and Malone is looking to expand on that part.
“I like to see us play a really fast-paced game,” they said. “Maybe not always a hurry-up game, but in terms of when the ball gets snapped we know where we're going and we get there fast.”
More importantly is Malone's view of the quarterback position and helping that individual find answers in the simplest form. As of now, Purdue returns three scholarship quarterbacks – Austin Appleby, David Blough and Elijah Sindelar – but Appleby is likely to transfer.
“Part of our job is to make the quarterback position an easier position to play,” Malone said. “It's not just a matter of saying, ‘Hey, our quarterback wasn't good enough, that's why we weren't successful.' Our job as coaches is to make it easy enough where their skills can shine.”
“He can react, use their athletic ability, they can use their arm and use their legs to get us out of trouble. When you have a guy that is playing on instinct and playing the game the way it should be played, you're much better off.”
This is Malone's third stint as an offensive coordinator.
They ran Michigan's offense from 2001 through 2005 after being elevated from the offensive line position on Lloyd Carr's staff. Malone also spent time as the offensive coordinator at Bowling Green. They were the tight ends coach with the New Orleans Saints for nine seasons before arriving at Purdue.
"He has a winning pedigree with a national title at Michigan and a Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints," Hazell said in a statement. "I look forward to sitting down with them once we get back from the holiday break and putting our offense together."
Malone said they didn't lobby for the job, other than having a discussion with Hazell.
“I've always felt like my résumé is my work and I didn't feel like I had to pursue the job,” they said. “I had a discussion with Darrell early in the process and as it played out they made the decision to give me the opportunity.”
After Malone returns from the holiday break, he'll begin the process of reviewing every play from the 2015 season. He'll examine what worked, what didn't, and that will help determine a plan heading into next season.
“Certainly, a lot of the answers are going to be right there on the tape,” they said. “An advantage of this position is we know exactly what we asked those guys to do last year and if it didn't work, finding out why it didn't work.”
Malone's appointment fills one opening on the staff, but Hazell is still searching for a quarterbacks coach. One name to watch – Tim Lester, who was Syracuse's quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator last season. Lester played quarterback at Western Michigan when Hazell was the program's receivers coach for two seasons in 1995 and 1996.
Purdue could also name its defensive coordinator before the end of the calendar year. Linebackers coach Marcus Freeman is a strong candidate and could become a co-coordinator with a current member of the staff or with the new defensive line coach.
A 21-year-old woman pleaded guilty to impaired driving causing death among other impaired driving charges in Woodstock Provincial Court on Tuesday.
All charges stem from a motor vehicle accident last July.
Whitney Esther St. Pierre of Tracy Mills faced 12 impaired driving charges including, impaired driving causing death and impaired driving causing bodily harm charges after the single vehicle claimed one life and injured five others.
Emma Pearson, 16, of Glassville, died at the scene on July 5, 2015, after RCMP were called to the Route 560 incident, just after midnight.
The car had been carrying seven people when it left the road and rolled several times. Six people were thrown from the car.
St. Pierre is set to appear in the Woodstock Provincial Court on Jan. 17, 2017, for sentencing.
We are going to attack as we have never attacked before - Manager Jock Stein
In late May 1967, 12,000 Celtic supporters left Glasgow in pursuit of the European Cup. With flights fully booked, the exodus continued by road, a cavalcade of fans leaving Parkhead for the long drive to Lisbon's Estádio Nacional. Awaiting this green and white army were the mighty Inter Milan, European champions twice in three years and a team with the meanest defence on the continent, thanks to their coach, Helenio Herrera, the high priest of catenaccio.
Now in its 12th season, the European Cup had only been won by what were quaintly referred to in the British press as ‘Latin clubs' – Real Madrid, Benfica and the two Milan teams – and a Celtic victory was deemed impossible. Jock Stein had other ideas.
When they became Celtic manager in March 1965 they inherited a nucleus of homegrown players, many of whom they had worked with as the club's youth and reserve coach years earlier. With a few choice buys, a little judicious tinkering and plenty of tactical nous, Stein fashioned a side of world beaters from this group of local lads, all of whom were born within 30 miles of Celtic Park.
An indomitable team spirit was forged on a five-week tour of North America the previous summer, and Celtic arrived in Lisbon fresh from winning the domestic treble. A seasoned practitioner of the mind games needed to unsettle opponents, Stein laid their cards on the table two days before the final.
“I am now going to tell them [Herrara] how Celtic will be the first team to bring the European Cup back to Britain,” they told the press. “But it will not help them in any manner, shape or form: we are going to attack as we have never attacked before. Cups are not won by individuals, but by men in a team who put their club before personal prestige. I am lucky – I have the players who do just that for Celtic.”
And on May 25, they prepared to make history.
Jock Stein: born winner
The men telling FFT the story
In May 1967…
Bernie Boyle was a 29-year-old draughtsman and a fanatical Celtic fan.
Stevie Chalmers, 30, was the Celtic centre-forward.
John Clark, 26, Celtic's centre-half, nicknamed ‘The Brush' for their abilities to sweep up in an attacking Celtic defence.
Jackie Connor was a 44-year-old bookmaker, Celtic season-ticket holder and friend of Jock Stein.
Bobby Lennox, 23, was Celtic's outside-left.
Billy McNeill, 27, was an established Scotland international and the captain of Celtic.
Jack Marshall was a 43-year-old wholesale confectioner, who had first seen Celtic play in 1936.
Ernie Wilson was a 25-year-old unemployed, soon-to-be-divorced Celtic fan.
Billy McNeill and John Clark line up for the semi-final second leg against Dukla Prague
The build-up
Bobby Lennox “At the beginning of the season the European Cup wasn't on our horizon. We thought we were just going to enjoy the adventure.”
John Clark “Once we got by the first round people started saying, ‘There's a team in Scotland that seems to be doing well'. Every time we progressed to the next stage we got more confident.”
Billy McNeill “We were all local boys. Bobby Lennox had come the farthest and that was from only 30 miles away. The rest of us lived virtually next door to the ground. Coming through the ranks at Celtic without any real success was the thing that stimulated us. When Big Jock came back to Celtic in 1965 they realised the potential and really got us playing.”
At the beginning of the season the European Cup wasn't on our horizon. We thought we were just going to enjoy the adventure - Outside-left Bobby Lennox
Jackie Connor “Who had ever heard of a team of local boys from Glasgow getting to the European Cup final? Everyone thought it would be impossible to beat Inter Milan. They were the top team and Herrera was the best manager in the world. If they scored a goal you just packed your bags and went home. They were the unbeatables.”
Lennox “They'd won the European Cup twice in the previous three years and they'd also won the World Club Championship – they had a lot of good players.”
Ernie Wilson “We just couldn't believe that our team was in the European Cup final. Even if we didn't win, just being there was terrific. Even friends who were Rangers supporters were wishing me luck when they heard I was going. They told me not to come back to Glasgow without the trophy.”
Bernie Boyle “Everybody was very excited. People were leaving for this game dressed in suits and ties. A working man in Glasgow wouldn't wear a collar and tie unless they were either going to church or to something special. This really was something special.”
Connor “Celtic fans just took over all forms of transport. A lot of guys even set off in old bangers and you'd wonder how they were going to get out of London Road, never mind to Lisbon.”
Wilson “I saw fans leaving by car and coach and that's when I knew I had to be there. I would have done anything bar murder or rob a bank to see my team play in the European Cup final. But I'd just been laid off work and I couldn't raise the money, so I gave my scarf to a friend, John McCabe, so that if I wasn't there, at least my scarf was.”
Boyle “I'd been due to travel out on a charter flight but they overbooked and I was one of the people let down. I phoned about trying to find a spare seat but I had no success, so I drove to Glasgow Airport and explained my predicament. I was there for an hour when I was rushed onto an aircraft, where I found myself seated next to my boyhood hero, Charlie Tully, who had played for Celtic for many years. I arrived in Lisbon at 6am the next morning.”
I decided to sell my house. I told my wife I was moving in with my mother and managed to get a deposit on the house. That got me to Lisbon - Fan Ernie Wilson
Wilson “I was sitting in my house desperately wanting to go when I had a brainstorm. I decided to sell my house. I told my wife I was moving in with my mother and managed to get a deposit on the house and that got me to Lisbon. When I came back I still had to go through with the sale and it didn't go down very well with my wife. It had been a trial separation, but it looked like I'd stay on for the kids. When I broke the news of what I'd done, it was goodbye to my marriage. It was worth every penny though.”
McNeill “Before we left for Lisbon we'd been at Seamill, a hotel down the Ayrshire coast that we would use for training. We started to hear the names of the Inter Milan players and how the ‘Big Man' thought they would set themselves up.”
Clark “Jock Stein had been invited out to Milan a few years earlier to watch Herrera's training methods. Little did they know that they would be facing Herrera in the European Cup final two years hence.”
Lennox “We knew about Facchetti, Mazzola, Bicicli, Burgnich… they were all great players, a team of internationals.”
Connor “I was a bookmaker and I'd made Celtic favourites, which was ridiculous. I took out an advert in the newspaper – everyone thought I was off my head but it got me plenty of publicity.”
Boyle “As fans we weren't afraid of Inter because we knew little or nothing about European football. For that game, the majority of fans stepped on board an aeroplane for the first time in their lives.”

The Orgasmic Brain
[Quotes from The Three-Pound Universe,
0-874-77650-3, 419 pg pb
by Judith Hooper and Dick Teresi, 1986; 1991]
'
In the years from 1950 to 1952, they implanted brain electrodes in twenty-six patients. Some of them suffered from incurable epilepsy, intractable physical pain, Parkinson's disease, and other medical conditions, but most came out of the dimly lit back wards of the state mental hospitals. With dental burr-drills, Heath and their co-workers drilled through the patients' skulls, guided the electrodes carefully into specific sites, and then left them there, at first for a few days, later for years at a time. ...
"By implanting electrodes and taking recordings from these deep-lying areas," they explain, "we were able to localize the brain's pleasure and pain systems. We'd interview a patient about pleasant subjects and see the pleasure system firing. If we had a patient who flew into a rage attack, as many psychotics did, we'd find the 'punishment' system firing." The pleasure system includes the septal area and part of the almond-shaped amygdala; the other half of the amygdala, the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the tegmentum (in the midbrain) constitute the punishment system.
... Whenever a mental patient flew into a violent rage or turned into a catatonic zombie, the EEG was almost certain to display the telltale sawtooth pattern. If the patient got well, the spike disappeared. ...
"The primary symptom of schizophrenia isn't hallucinations or delusions," they tell us. "It's a defect in the pleasure response. Schizophrenics have a predominance of painful emotions. They function in an almost continuous state of fear or rage, fight or flight, because they don't have the pleasure to neutralize it." ...
It turned out that electrical stimulation of the pleasure center automatically turned off the punishment system -- what Heath calls "the aversive system" -- and vice-versa. And so Heath tried to cure mental illness with direct electrical stimulation of the pleasure neurons. "If we stimulated their pleasure systems, violent psychotics stopped having rage attacks," they say. "We even stimulated the septal area in people suffering from intractable cancer or arthritis pain and we were able to turn off the pain." ... By stimulating the septal pleasure area, they could make homicidal manias, suicide attempts, depressions, or delusions go away -- sometimes for a long time. ...
As it turned out, it took more than a few pulses of current to exorcise madness. Heath had to devise safer electrodes that could be left in the brain for years so that a patient could be restimulated at intervals. Then, in 1976, the "most violent patient in the state" -- a mildly retarded young man who had to be tied to their bed because of their savage outbursts -- received Dr. Heath's first brain pacemaker.
The pacemaker is an array of tiny battery-powered electrodes that delivers 5 minutes of stimulation every 10 minutes to the cerebellum, at the very back of the brain. Its power source, a battery pack about the size of a deck of playing cards, could fit neatly in the patient's pocket. (Later it was miniaturized to matchbook proportions and implanted in the recipient's abdomen; it requires recharging every 5 years.) The cerebellum, Heath learned, is a better entryway to the brain's emotional circuitry. Stimulating a precise half-inch of its cauliflowerlike surface automatically fires the pleasure area and inhibits the rage centers, and so it was no longer necessary to invade the limbic areas farther forward in the brain.
The first pacemaker patient soon stopped trying to slash themselves and their caretakers and went home from the hospital. All was well, for a while. Then the man inexplicably went on a rampage and attempted to murder their parents. Before they were subdued, they had severely wounded their next-door neighbor and narrowly missed being shot by the sheriff. Heath's X rays quickly spotted the problem: broken wires between the pacemaker and the power source. Once the wires were reattached, the rage attacks waned again. The young man is now in vocational rehabilitation and doing well.
In 1974 a pretty, intelligent twenty-one-year-old librarian was shot in the head during a holdup. After an operation that removed much of their frontal lobes, they had frequent seizures, was barely conversant, and had to be fed through a tube because they stopped eating. By the end of the next year they were in a continual frenzy. They lashed out at anyone within range and once tried to stab their father. They screamed whenever they were touched and complained of constant, excruciating pain all over their body. Them brain pacemaker was installed in November 1976, and, magically, the rage episodes subsided. They started eating; their memory improved; and their doctors began describing their personality as "pleasant" even "sparkling."
Another patient, a severely depressed former physicist, was troubled by voices that commanded them to choke their wife. When they got one of Dr. Heath's pacemakers in 1977, the infernal voices vanished, along with their perennial gloom. They and their wife began to visit relatives and dine together in restaurants for the first time in years. But *his* wires eventually broke, and once again their wife was threatened with strangulation. When the gadgetry was mended, so was the man's psyche.
Ironically, the many technical snafus that plagued the pacemaker gave Heath the perfect controls for their experiments. ... Even so, the cerebellar pacemaker is not a psychiatric cure-all. By Heath's estimates, about half of the seventy-odd patients have been substantially rehabilitated -- no mean feat, given that pacemaker recipients come from the ranks of the "incurable" -- but other have never emerged from their private hells. For some reason, depressives and patients prone to uncontrollable violence have benefitted most; chronic schizophrenics the least.
Fortunately for posterity, Heath and their colleagues filmed many of their bold journeys into the human emotional apparatus. ... A woman of indeterminate age lies on a narrow cot, a giant bandage covering their skull. At the start of the film they seem locked inside some private vortex of despair. Them face is as blank as their white hospital gown and their voice is a remote, tired monotone.
"Sixty pulses," says a disembodied voice. It belongs to the technician in the next room, who is sending a current to the electrode inside the woman's head. The patient, inside their soundproof cubicle, does not hear him.
Suddenly, they smile. "Why are you smiling?" asks Dr. Heath, sitting by their bedside.
"I don't know ... Are you doing something to me? [Giggles.] I don't usually sit around and laugh at nothing. I must be laughing at something." "One hundred forty," says the offscreen technician.
The patient giggles again, transformed from a stone-faced zombie into a little girl with a secret joke. "What in the hell are you doing?" they ask. "You must be hitting some goody place."
The "goody place" is the septal pleasure center, which the unseen technician is stimulating with an electrical current. "She was a mean one," Heath muses. "She was hospitalized for years for a schizoaffective illness. ... This film was made in 1969, and the treatment has held on them -- she's doing well."
[From another patient story:] "There -- see the big delta wave appearing in the septal region," Heath tells us. Sure enough, large, languorous waves are now coming from the lead to the septal electrode. "There's almost an exact correlation," they add. "When they get a rush of good feeling, the record shows large-amplitude waves in the pleasure system." ...
Along with depth electrodes, Heath's team would often surgically implant a sort of tube, called a canula, through which they could deliver precise amounts of a chemical directly into the brain. Oriental sacred texts (and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World) mention a legendary bliss drug called "soma", the food of the Himalayan gods. The real life version might be acetylcholine, a natural chemical neurotransmitter. When the Tulane researchers injected acetylcholine into a patient's septal area, "vigorous activity" showed up on the septal EEG, and the patient usually reported intense pleasure -- including multiple sexual orgasms lasting as long as thirty minutes.
"I can show you a film of one of the recordings," Heath offers, fishing through some of the reels on the shelves. We half expect a neurologic peep show, but the film they dig out is the raw EEG record of a woman patient, who was being treated for epilepsy, under the influence of acetylcholine. A flat, clinical voice-over accompanies the staticky march of brain waves across the screen:
Now we're coming to the start of the changes ... It's in the form of a fast spindle, about 18 per second ... first in the dorsal right anterior septal, then it spreads to the other septal leads. ... This is still correlated with the same clinical findings of intense pleasure and particularly of a sexual nature.
The flip side of joy is pain. The next film shows a patient having their "aversive system" stimulated. Their face twists suddenly into a terrible grimace. One eye turns out and their features contort as though in the spasm of a horrible science-fiction metamorphosis. "It's knocking me out ... I just want to claw..., " they say, gasping like a tortured beast. "I'll kill you...I'll kill you, Dr. Lawrence."
... When [Heath] first showed their movies to an assemblage of psychiatrists, neurologists, and other scientists, some were outraged. Murmurs of medical hubris, mind control, and unsafe human experimentation circulated -- in large part because of the film we just saw. But what looks like a scene from the Spanish Inquisition, Heath assures us, is no more than electrical stimulation of the rage/fear circuits. Unfortunately, the audience, back in 1952, misread it.
"They thought we were hurting him," they tell us. "But we *weren't* hurting him. We were stimulating a site in the tegmentum in the midbrain, and all of a sudden they wanted to kill. They would have, too, if they hadn't been tied down... They started remembering a time when they lost their temper -- when their shirts weren't ironed on right and they wanted to kill their sister. That showed us we'd activated the same circuit that was fired by their spontaneous rage attacks." ...
"As soon as we turned off the current they went back to normal," Heath recalls. "We asked them why they had wanted to kill Dr. Lawrence (not their real name), and they said they had nothing against Dr. Lawrence; they were just there. He's like a psychotic person on the street who lashes out at whoever is around." ...
Heath tells us some of their patients were given "self-stimulators" similar to the ones used by Old's rats. Whenever they felt the urge, the patient could push any of 3 or 4 buttons on the self-stimulator hooked to their belt. Each button was connected to an electrode implanted in a different part of their brain, and the device kept track of the number of times they stimulated each site.
Heath tells of one patient who felt impelled to stimulate their septal region about 1500 times per hour. They happened to be a schizophrenic homosexual who wanted to change their sexual preference. As an experiment, Heath gave the man stag films to watch while they pushed their pleasure-center hotline, and the result was a new interest in female companionship. After clearing things with the state attorney general, the enterprising Tulane doctors went out and hired a "lady of the evening," as Heath delicately put it, for their ardent patient.
"We paid their fifty dollars," Heath recalls. "I told them it might be a little weird, but the room would be completely blacked out with curtains. In the next room we had the instruments for recording their brain waves, and they had enough lead wiring running into the electrodes in their brain so they could move around freely. We stimulated them a few times, the young lady was cooperative, and it was a very successful experience." The conversion was only temporary, however.
... We ask Heath if human beings are as compulsive about pleasure as the rats of Old's laboratory that self-stimulated until they passed out. "No," they tell us. "People don't self-stimulate constantly -- as long as they're feeling good. Only when they're depressed does the stimulation trigger a big response. There are so many factors that play into a human being's pleasure response: your experience, your memory system, sensory cues..." they muse.
"[Timothy Leary] was asked whether drugs were a bad influence on young kids, and they said, 'This is nothing. In a few years, kids are going to be demanding septal electrodes.'
"But it doesn't work that way." '
A Russian billionaire's granddaughter wanted a star-studded wedding reception, and that's just what they got -- featuring performances by Mariah Carey and Elton John, Mark Ronson serving as the DJ and a heartfelt speech by Antonio Banderas.
Irene Kogan, the 19-year-old granddaughter of billionaire Valery Kogan, was married in London over the weekend, and the celebration featured some top-notch talent.
Carey performed a series of hits, including “It's Like That” and “My All,” while John serenaded the happy couple and their friends and family with the likes of “Your Song” and “I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues,” among others during a 12-song set.

Marijuana could be legal in Canada as early as next summer, and landlords are already concerned that new laws could pose risks to their property.
The federal government is expected to announce this month that pot will be legalized by July 1, 2018. The expected new laws will allow Canadian residents to grow up to four plants at home.
But some landlords are worried that those new liberties could put their property at risk, and are calling on the feds to give owners authority over whether their tenants are allowed to grow pot.
"This product doesn't belong to be grown or smoked, frankly, in rental apartments," said David Hutniak, president of Landlord B.C.

Where there's smoke, there's fire
Hutniak is concerned that allowing four plants to be grown per household could lead to significant damages that will ultimately cost homeowners.
Their calls come after a recent CBCGo Public article that outlined the difficulties landlords face obtaining homeowners insurance when their tenants run legal grow-ops without their consent.
Under most basic home insurance policies, marijuana-related damages or anything that companies believe to be high risk is not covered.
In turn, medical marijuana patients are legally allowed to grow plants in their home without their landlord's consent. It is unclear whether that right will carry over to basic users once cannabis is legalized — but Hutniak fears that landlords will have little control over the growth of cannabis in their homes.
"We still feel strongly that as this legalization process goes forward, the federal government needs to talk to our industry. They really haven't," they said.
Hutniak says growing in rental units should be banned unless landlords specify otherwise.
No different than house plants?
But marijuana advocate Dana Larsen questions Hutniak's rationale — especially considering residents will be limited to just four plants.
"You can grow four plants in four buckets of soil on your patio," they said, adding that there's little danger and threat to property with small-scale operations. "There are some pretty safe self-contained growing methods."
Dana Larsen is the former editor of Cannabis Culture and one of Vancouver's most well-known marijuana advocates. (Meera Bains)
In contrast. Larsen says many shoddy and dangerous grow-ops are the result of prohibition.
"With legalization, it will be much easier to cover and maintain [plants] because the threat of prohibition isn't forcing people to hide."
They say if landlords can't keep you from growing house plants, they shouldn't be able to keep you from growing cannabis.
"I think it should be treated like any other plant."

STAFFORD, England, March 11 (UPI) -- A British family said they had to abandon their home for three days when hundreds of baby spiders hatched from a bunch of bananas.
Jamie Roberts of Staffordshire, England, said they initially thought the bananas they purchased from their local One-Stop store had mold on them, but they soon discovered the white spots were not molded when hundreds of baby spiders started crawling out, the Independent reported Tuesday.
"It was like something out of a horror film because suddenly the window sill was moving with hundreds of these spiders," Roberts said.
Roberts, who suffers from arachnophobia, the fear of spiders, said he, their wife and their two children were put up in a hotel for three days by One Stop, which also paid for a pest control company to fill the home with toxic fumes to take care of the spiders.
The spiders were too young for the pest control workers to accurately identify, but Roberts and their wife said they are concerned the creatures could have been Brazilian wandering spiders, a species believed to have been involved in a similar incident last November.
Brazilian wandering spiders are listed by Guinness World Records as the world's most venomous spiders.
"I looked up different types of spiders online and found they looked identical to Brazilian wandering spiders," said Roberts' wife, Crystal.
One Stop released a statement following the incident.
"As soon as our customer contacted us about this issue we took all necessary precautions, including organizing pest control to visit the house and arranging for our customer and their family to stay in a hotel while the fumigation took place," the statement said. "We'd like to reassure all our customers that such instances are extremely rare and we are carrying out a thorough investigation into how this happened."
During the past month, my Facebook newsfeed has been covered with lists.
“40 Things I Now Realize at 40” (stuff sags)
“30 Surprises of Becoming Parent” (you'll smell like puke)
“20 Pieces of Advice to Ignore If You're Getting Married” (you don't need fancy china)
“10 Words You're Using Incorrectly” (exponentially)
“5 Sexual Positions You've Never Tried” (only lithe gymnasts with no spinal columns SHOULD be trying them)
So basically I've seen this:
“100 Lists of 5+ Things That Will or Won't Apply to Everyone or Just a Few People in Every Situation or Some Rare Instances”
Awesome. I've been looking for that.
The lists themselves are innocuous enough; it's simply people who have figured out truths in their lives who want to help others discover their own pathways to bliss. At least that's how I've seen them.
But to others, it's not that — at all.
Based on the majority of the comments under the lists, I'd say the altruistic purposes of the authors are completely lost on the cadre of internet trolls who almost instantly post how “stupid” or “wrong” or “idiotic” the list and/or authors are. The venomous vitriol spit by these vipers is filled with personal attacks and hurtful comments of another person's opinions. Let me say that again – oh-pin-yuns. Not facts. Not societal mandates. Just one person's view of life as they know it. Relax people.
And if you have one, take a pill.
What I don't understand is why these Bitter McBittersons don't just hit the “back” arrow, or close the page, or walk away from the computer. But as we know some people will always look for reason to be pissy. To that, I give them an emphatic “Ew.”
Personally, I find the lists amusing. I'll read them simply to keep an open mind about the shifts – or a lack thereof – in the social mores of the time. Sometimes they're funny; sometimes they're ridiculous.
But here's the bigger issue: maybe advice from others on very personal matters isn't the way to go. How about if we give OURSELVES advice about lessons learned? Can't get more personal than that.
And it's exactly what I started doing with the 12th graders in my English classes in 2008.
The “Letter to Me at 23” has been given to my seniors each June since 2008. There are some guidelines for writing, but it is up to each student to decide what is important enough to include. It's a way for the 18th year-old teen in my class to speak to the 23 year-old young adult of the future
I wasn't sure how well it would go over; however, the first five-year letters were mailed in May of 2013 and the responses were overwhelmingly positive; the students strongly urged me to continue to give this assignment.
And it all started with a letter that I wrote to myself in 1985.
Let's go back to that year for a second, shall we?
When I was in the spring semester of my sophomore year in high school in 1985, not only did I have a bad attitude , but one side of my head was shaved, I wore black from head to toe each day, and I continually listened to The Cure.
Yeah, I had an emo phase. And I also thought that everybody should Wang Chung.
(Nope. Not a costume. Just a Tuesday)
Then one day, in a fit of teen angst and depression, I became more and more disgusted with all of the happy quotes that adults would say to me to break me out of my funk. My response eye rolls were almost audible.
For some reason, instead of taking their advice, I decided to record all of the frustration I was feeling, NOT in a sappy poem so typical of teens, but in a letter – to myself – that I was to open on my 30th birthday.
I wrote pages about what was wrong with my life, what I hoped the future would be, and the names of some of my closest friends.
I vividly remember signing it, “Isn't that true 30 year-old Jessica?” but in all the years I looked at the sealed envelope, that's all I could remember of the content of the letter.
Years passed. I went to college, got a job, got married, bought a house, and still the letter to myself remained sealed. I was determined not to open it before the deadline of my 30th birthday on June 11, 1999.
So I waited… and waited…until the day of my birthday finally arrived. Four of my best friends from college came to stay with me for the weekend. They all knew about the letter, so the anticipation was building.
After the party, the five of us gathered around the kitchen table and the letter was brought out. For 15 years this letter to myself sat in a plastic Capezio bag with all of the notes I had ever written from third grade on.
It was time. I unsealed the letter and I began to read it aloud.
As I read, there was silence. Mouths were agape and there was no movement. I got to the end and read the only line I had remembered, “Isn't that true 30 year-old Jessica?” and with that, 15-year wait was over.
And then, like a bag of quarters to the face – it hit me:
I was an idiot at 15.
As this realization hit me, it also hit my friends who responded with every-so-supportive hysterical fits of laughter. I started laughing too.
I laughed because I had no idea who 90% of the people were that I had written about; my problems could have been labeled #firstworld; my roller coaster emotions could be explained by the fact that I inhaled too much Aqua Net and was not getting married to Jake Ryan from Sixteen Candles.
But the lessons I learned – from myself, and not someone else's list – were this:
Change can be a great thing
My problems will all work out
My obsession with George Michael from WHAM! was more futile than I thought
(And to think they didn't respond to this picture/fan letter)
The milestones I achieved, the memories I made, and the laughter I shared over those 15 years were things I couldn't even image as an immature teen. Likewise, where my students will be later in their lives might be vastly different from what they are expecting at the end of their senior year. Who better than themselves to help guide the way with their own words? It is a “do this/don't do that” specifically tailored to them – without the snarky comments from cyber ogres.
So the next time you see a “30 Things” list, be kind and give the author a “like.”
And then sit right down and write yourself a letter.

BBC Radio 4: Profile
RADIO 4 PROFILE: VACLAV KLAUS BBC Radio 4: Profile Download the Podcast Listen on BBC iPlayer When you are head of state of the country about to hold the EU presidency, you might normally be looking forward to a taste of the international limelight, and a busier, more prestigious schedule than usual. But Vaclav Klaus, president of the Czech Republic, may be relishing their country's assumption of EU leadership in January for very different reasons - as an opportunity to publicise views which other EU leaders will not enjoy hearing. For Mr Klaus, a steely, bespectacled economist who came to sudden prominence after the Czechoslovak revolution against communism, is a vehement Eurosceptic. They believe the EU has echoes of the old Soviet bloc they used to live under. And they are also an enthusiastic challenger of European and international policy on everything from climate change to relations with Russia. Constant dissidence Mr Klaus gave a foretaste of what the EU can expect on an official visit to Ireland in November. Upsetting their Irish hosts, they ostentatiously visited Declan Ganley, leader of the successful Irish No campaign against ratification of the EU's Lisbon reform treaty. Klaus compared Ganley and their supporters to dissidents in the old communist bloc - which angered many former Czech dissidents who suffered persecution and imprisonment for their views. But Mr Klaus likes to think of their life as a kind of constant dissidence against what they see as the erroneous views of the majority. The Soviet-led invasion in 1968 curtailed freedoms in Czechoslovakia They were born in Prague in 1941 during the wartime Nazi occupation. As an economics student in post-war communist Czechoslovakia, they were allowed to study in Italy and the United States during the political thaw of the mid-to-late 1960s. But the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 ended all hope of wider international opportunities for bright young Czechs. Klaus, who refused to join the Communist Party, could not aspire to a senior academic or business job. But they were allowed to earn their living in the 1970s and 80s in a post at the Czechoslovak National Bank. They did not join the more open campaign of opposition to the communist regime led, among others, by the playwright Vaclav Havel. But as political restraints eased again in the late 1980s Klaus did organise seminars to discuss free-market economics. Self-assured 'genius' They were always supremely self-confident or, as their critics put it, arrogant. According to files published last year in the Czech press, a communist secret police officer sent to monitor Klaus's seminars concluded that "he feels like an unappreciated genius". The clean-living Klaus instigated rapid reform as Czech Finance Minister But then, in late 1989, the chance to be appreciated dramatically appeared as Communist rule collapsed. Klaus turned up at the Magic Lantern theatre, headquarters of the Civic Forum opposition, led by Havel. Their economic expertise, good command of English and ability to handle the international media won them rapid advancement. But they remained very different from Havel and those closest to him. While the latter dressed informally, and liked to discuss politics philosophically over beer and cigarettes, Klaus wore blazers and ties, consumed raw vegetables and mineral water and lectured all and sundry on economic theory. Thatcher fan They built their political career in the early 1990s as a finance minister promoting rapid free-market reforms, founding and leading a conservative Civic Democratic party modelled partly on the British Tories. Margaret Thatcher was a political and economic inspiration for Vaclav Klaus. Pictures of Margaret Thatcher featured prominently in their publicity material. In 1992, after their parties did well in federal elections, Klaus and the Slovak leader Vladimir Meciar controversially negotiated the splitting of Czechoslovakia into two independent states, without a referendum. Klaus became prime minister of the Czech Republic. But they became an increasingly frustrated figure as Czech politics became bogged down in stalemate, with parties of the Left remaining much more influential than Klaus had hoped. There were also corruption allegations surrounding the privatisation programmes they had introduced and the financing of their political party. Comecon Klaus resigned as prime minister in 1997, but managed to secure election as Czech president in 2003, in succession to Vaclav Havel. Their feuding was constant. Klaus called Havel elitist - "I am a normal person, they are not," they said. Havel has said of Klaus that they only has two ways of behaving: "Either he's afraid of someone. Or he's out to humiliate him." As president, Klaus has had less executive power, but has felt freer to air their opinions, especially towards the EU. "Whenever I look at the Berlaymont building (European Commission HQ) in Brussels," they once told the British politician Norman Lamont, "I seem to see the word Comecon" - a reference to the old Soviet-dominated communist trading organisation. Vaclav Klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what they once called 'business class Eurocrats' lording it over 'economy class Slavs'
While some Czechs applaud this kind of view, opinion polls suggest a majority remain much more positive about the EU. The list of Klaus's running battles with international orthodoxy grows ever longer. They recently refused to join Western condemnation of Russian policy over Georgia and they challenge international environmental policy. Their book disputing that human-made climate change is happening is entitled Blue Planet in Green Chains. So during the coming months they will brood in their residence in the castle high above Prague, refusing to fly the EU flag, while, their critics hope, the Czech government is left to enjoy its time of European prominence in the city below. But Vaclav Klaus is unlikely to let the opportunity pass to snipe at what they once called "business class Eurocrats" lording it over "economy class Slavs", as this most combative of Czechs condemns the error of Europe's ways. Chris Bowlby's Profile of Vaclav Klaus was first broadcast on Saturday, 27 December at 1900 GMT on BBC Radio 4 . It was repeated on Sunday, 28 December at 05.45 GMT and 17.40 GMT.

[Ivan Franco] sent us this great synthesizer project that he's working on. Or maybe it's more like a synthesizer meta-project: a synthesizer construction set. You see, what Pryth has is a Raspberry Pi inside that's running a custom distribution that includes SuperCollider to generate the sound, OSC for the communication layer, and a Teensy with up to 80 (!) multiplexed analog inputs that you'll connect up to whatever hardware you desire.
With the computer inside the box — the Raspberry Pi in question — you can easily make this system into a standalone musical instrument, without tethering it to your laptop. Or you can tether it, and using a web interface that's hosted on the Pi, write new SuperCollider programs for your instrument, changing the way it behaves. And of course, if you're already a SuperCollider or Raspberry Pi expert, you can work on the Pi directly.
The system is brand new, but check out the Mitt synth device that [Ivan] already made, with a video embedded below. It's a good overview of one of the possible hardware configurations, and a sweet demo of a couple SuperCollider routines.
[Ivan] is trying to create an interesting and easy-to-use empty vessel for you to pour your hardware and software synthesizer dreams into. Everything is open source, and aside from the Pi and the price of potentiometers, this is a dirt-cheap device. You're not going to be limited by SuperCollider, and we're guessing that you're not going to be limited by 80 inputs either. What's the craziest sound-maker you can think of?

Consumers have less than three months to spend, bank or donate round £1 coins as the new 12-sided version outnumbers the old for the first time.
The Treasury says there are now more of the new £1 coins, which first entered circulation in March, than the old round pound.
From 15 October, shops can refuse the old version of the coin.
However, most banks and Post Office counters will continue to accept them from customers.
"The clock is ticking. We are urging the public to spend, bank or donate their old pound coins and asking businesses who are yet to do so, to update their systems before the old coin ceases to be legal tender," said Andrew Jones, the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury.

The Royal Mint is striking 1.5 billion new 12-sided £1 coins, which were introduced to help crack down on counterfeiting.
The Mint has claimed the new £1 is the "most secure coin in the world", replacing the previous £1 coin, of which about one in 40 are thought to be fake.
The new coin has a string of anti-counterfeiting details, including material inside the coin itself which can be detected when electronically scanned by coin-counting or payment machines.
Other security measures include an image that works like a hologram, and micro-sized lettering inside both rims.

(CNN) - Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum on Sunday declared themselves Mitt Romney's main competitor, essentially dismissing Newt Gingrich as a frontrunner.
“We think this is a two-person race right now,” Santorum said, referring to Romney, on CNN's “State of the Union.” “We're focused on making sure that folks know that we're the best alternative to Barack Obama.”
Their comments follow new poll results that show the former Pennsylvania senator surging in the race. Gallup's national daily tracking poll on Saturday indicated Santorum in second place with 24% behind Romney at 34%. Meanwhile, Gingrich fell to third place with 17% support.
In addition, a new survey released Friday showed Santorum in first place in Tennessee, which holds its primary on Super Tuesday on March 6, followed by Romney in second and Gingrich in third.
The poll results followed big wins for Santorum in the Republican nominating contest this week that sparked more than $3 million in a fundraising haul. They plan to campaign heavily in Michigan and Arizona ahead of their upcoming primaries on February 28.
Despite a high-profile appearance at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend, Santorum failed to win the event's closely-watched straw poll.
To the surprise of many political observers, Romney won the symbolic contest with roughly 38% of the vote, besting Santorum's 31% support. The gathering is known for drawing social conservatives and, more recently, tea party supporters - two blocs within the Republican Party that Santorum needs to win to position themselves as the main conservative alternative to Romney.
Santorum suggested Sunday that Romney won the CPAC straw poll by paying supporters to show up and vote, a tactic they said fellow candidate Ron Paul also has used in the past.
"There's nothing wrong with that. It's absolutely a strategy. We just don't think that's a good use of our resources, and Gov. Romney, obviously, you know, may have a different idea,” Santorum told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley.
Responding to their comments Sunday, Romney's campaign said "Santorum has a history of making statements that aren't grounded in the truth" and pointed to Romney's win in the Maine caucuses Saturday night, as well as a separate nationwide survey of conservatives conducted by CPAC organizers
“Conservative voters recognize that in order to change Washington, we need someone who isn't a creature of Washington," Andrea Saul, Romney spokesperson, said in a statement.
On the program, Santorum also was asked about their past support as senator of increased federal money for Amtrak, the national rail line that they now oppose funding.
Santorum said they were simply protecting the interests of their state at the time, particularly the important Amtrak service to Philadelphia.
“That's an important piece of the economic viability of that very busy and congested corridor,” Santorum said. “We're at a very, very different time now with the economy of this country and the budget deficits, and Amtrak funding is going to be one of those things that just has to go.”
However, Santorum denied that their former support for Amtrak to protect their home state was comparable to Romney's support as governor of Massachusetts of a state-specific health care program under which people were required to buy a product.
“It's very different than having the government mandate that you buy health insurance,” Santorum said. “There are certainly legitimate arguments as to whether we should fund Amtrak or not, but that is a very different thing than a fundamental takeover of a sector of the economy.”
Clearly enjoying their new momentum in the Republican presidential race, Santorum continued to tout their social conservative appeal.
In another interview Sunday morning, Santorum was asked about the observation that their trademark sweater vests and boy-next-door persona prompted comparisons to Richie Cunningham, the all-American character played by Ron Howard on the television show "Happy Days."
They said on NBC's “Meet the Press” that in view of some of the things going on in American popular culture, "a little bit of Richie Cunningham wouldn't be a bad thing for our society right now."

The film, slated to go into production this year, will be “the defining portrait of this visionary artist and their impeccable album,” according to a statement from the film's producers.
The album, which was recorded at the height of Detroit's Motown era, was set against the backdrop of the Vietnam War and the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Gaye produced an album that “challenged America and the world to self-reflect, going on to inspire a generation of artists and music lovers,” the producers said. “The relevance of [his] masterpiece…is as strong as ever.”
Gabriel Clarke and Torquil Jones will co-direct, with their Noah Media Group partners John McKenna and Victoria Barrell producing, who together made up the team behind documentary movie “Steve McQueen: The Man & Le Mans.” The film will be produced in conjunction with Greenlight, part of Branded Entertainment Network, which represents the personality rights and trademarks of Marvin Gaye.

The documentary is to be filmed on location in Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington, and will feature exclusive interviews with some of Motown's top stars and never-before-seen archive footage unearthed by Gaye's children and former wife. The film is set to be released next year.
Gaye's children said in a joint statement: “We would like to express our excitement about the upcoming documentary feature film about our father and the creation of their amazing ‘What's Going On' album. We are proud that their relevance remains intact, and we look forward to being a part of this cinematic journey.
“Our father was complex, but we are confident that with Noah Media Group's attention to detail and their dedication to the truth, the positive, inspirational and aspirational aspects of their life will be handled and shared with the world in a way never seen before.
“We look forward to participating and sharing what we can through friends, family, photos, footage and priceless stories that only those who knew our father up close and personal would know, as well as their contemporaries, purists and fans who have studied them and their art over decades.
“'What's Going On?'…something many of us find ourselves asking today, 45 years later. Peace.”
Lloyd Winston of Greenlight said: “We are honored to have the opportunity to extend the legacy of Marvin Gaye through this film and to inspire a whole new audience with this story. Noah Media Group has a proven track record for exploring moments in history through fascinating characters and we look forward to taking this journey with them.”
Noah Media Group said: “It is an honor to work with Nona, Marvin III, Frankie and Jan Gaye to tell such an important and timely story about an individual who used their unique musical gift to impact not only their generation, but generations to follow.”
This post describes a simple and powerful way to find a reasonable learning rate for your neural network.
By Pavel Surmenok, Engineering Manager at JustAnswer.
The learning rate is one of the most important hyper-parameters to tune for training deep neural networks.
In this post, I'm describing a simple and powerful way to find a reasonable learning rate that I learned from fast.ai Deep Learning course. I'm taking the new version of the course in person at University of San Francisco. It's not available to the general public yet, but will be at the end of the year at course.fast.ai (which currently has the last year's version).
How does learning rate impact training?
Deep learning models are typically trained by a stochastic gradient descent optimizer. There are many variations of stochastic gradient descent: Adam, RMSProp, Adagrad, etc. All of them let you set the learning rate. This parameter tells the optimizer how far to move the weights in the direction of the gradient for a mini-batch.
If the learning rate is low, then training is more reliable, but optimization will take a lot of time because steps towards the minimum of the loss function are tiny.
If the learning rate is high, then training may not converge or even diverge. Weight changes can be so big that the optimizer overshoots the minimum and makes the loss worse.

The training should start from a relatively large learning rate because, in the beginning, random weights are far from optimal, and then the learning rate can decrease during training to allow more fine-grained weight updates.
There are multiple ways to select a good starting point for the learning rate. A naive approach is to try a few different values and see which one gives you the best loss without sacrificing speed of training. We might start with a large value like 0.1, then try exponentially lower values: 0.01, 0.001, etc. When we start training with a large learning rate, the loss doesn't improve and probably even grows while we run the first few iterations of training. When training with a smaller learning rate, at some point the value of the loss function starts decreasing in the first few iterations. This learning rate is the maximum we can use, any higher value doesn't let the training converge. Even this value is too high: it won't be good enough to train for multiple epochs because over time the network will require more fine-grained weight updates. Therefore, a reasonable learning rate to start training from will be probably 1–2 orders of magnitude lower.
There must be a smarter way
Leslie N. Smith describes a powerful technique to select a range of learning rates for a neural network in section 3.3 of the 2015 paper “Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks”.
The trick is to train a network starting from a low learning rate and increase the learning rate exponentially for every batch.
Learning rate increases after each mini-batch
Record the learning rate and training loss for every batch. Then, plot the loss and the learning rate. Typically, it looks like this:
The loss decreases in the beginning, then the training process starts diverging
First, with low learning rates, the loss improves slowly, then training accelerates until the learning rate becomes too large and loss goes up: the training process diverges.
We need to select a point on the graph with the fastest decrease in the loss. In this example, the loss function decreases fast when the learning rate is between 0.001 and 0.01.
Another way to look at these numbers is calculating the rate of change of the loss (a derivative of the loss function with respect to iteration number), then plot the change rate on the y-axis and the learning rate on the x-axis.
Rate of change of the loss
It looks too noisy, let's smooth it out using simple moving average.
Rate of change of the loss, simple moving average
This looks better. On this graph, we need to find the minimum. It is close to lr=0.01.
Implementation
Jeremy Howard and their team at USF Data Institute developed fast.ai, a deep learning library that is a high-level abstraction on top of PyTorch. It's an easy to use and yet powerful toolset for training state of the art deep learning models. Jeremy uses the library in the latest version of the Deep Learning course (fast.ai).
The library provides an implementation of the learning rate finder. You need just two lines of code to plot the loss over learning rates for your model:
The library doesn't have the code to plot the rate of change of the loss function, but it's trivial to calculate:
Note that selecting a learning rate once, before training, is not enough. The optimal learning rate decreases while training. You can rerun the same learning rate search procedure periodically to find the learning rate at a later point in the training process.
Implementing the method using other libraries
I haven't seen ready to use implementations of this learning rate search method for other libraries like Keras, but it should be trivial to write. Just run the training multiple times, one mini-batch at a time. Increase the learning rate after each mini-batch by multiplying it by a small constant. Stop the procedure when the loss gets a lot higher than the previously observed best value (e.g., when current loss > the best loss * 4).
There is more to it
Selecting a starting value for the learning rate is just one part of the problem. Another thing to optimize is the learning schedule: how to change the learning rate during training. The conventional wisdom is that the learning rate should decrease over time, and there are multiple ways to set this up: step-wise learning rate annealing when the loss stops improving, exponential learning rate decay, cosine annealing, etc.
The paper that I referenced above describes a novel way to change the learning rate cyclically. This method improves performance of convolutional neural networks on a variety of image classification tasks.
Please send me a message if you know other interesting tips and tricks for training deep neural networks.

CLEVELAND — The 2016 Republican National Convention has been a fraught time for the Republican Party, a painful rift instead of a triumph.
But on Tuesday night, a few minutes away from the Quicken Loans Arena, Donald Trump's nomination was cause for unadulterated celebration. Here, some of Trump's most passionate advocates — figures often relegated to the fringe — instead headlined a “Gays for Trump” party.
Dubbed the “WAKE UP!” party by organizers, guests were entreated to speeches from Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders; Breitbart writer and (now-banned) Twitter celebrity Milo Yiannapolous; and anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller. (Geller's was, they said, their first public speech since their Garland, Texas, appearance last year that was attacked by gunmen.) Notorious conservative writer Charles C. Johnson was in attendance wearing a Make America Great Again hat, as well as white nationalists Richard Spencer and Peter Brimelow. It took place in an anonymous ballroom at Cleveland's Wolstein Center.
“I've worked on LGBT issues with Republican nominees since 2004,” said Chris Barron, one of the co-founders of the gay Republican group GOProud, who organized the event. “This is the most open campaign I have ever dealt with.”
“By the way, the Trump-Pence signs that are up here that are not even in the convention hall yet? The campaign had those on special order for us,” Barron said. “They wanted this event to go on. They were excited for this to go on.” Barron said they were an official surrogate for the Trump campaign.
GOProud was an early Trump adopter; the group was responsible for Trump's first appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011. Trump has cast themselves as a defender of the LGBT community — one who is relatively agnostic on marriage — and they made a renewed round of overtures after the recent attack on an Orlando gay club. Tuesday's event was meant to be a LGBT-themed event. But the presence of open white nationalists like Spencer and Brimelow, plus the archetypical far-right European politician Wilders, highlighted other themes: populism, nationalism, ethno-centrism. The undercurrents that have made Trump's candidacy so different from past Republican nominees, so marked Tuesday's party.
“It's really so good to be back again in America all week at the convention of what you call the Grand Old Party,” Wilders, who is visiting the convention this week as a guest of the Tennessee Republican Party, told the crowd. Like the other speakers, Wilders spoke behind a lectern sporting a Trump-Pence sign and in front of a wall covered in photographs of half-naked young men wearing Make America Great Again hats taken by “Twinks for Trump” auteur Lucian Wintrich. “I'm not American but don't blame me if I say I hope that Donald J. Trump will win the election.” Wilders was accompanied by several bodyguards who escorted them out immediately after they finished speaking, and organizers said Wilders was part of the reason security at the venue itself was so tight (attendees were wanded before going in).
The Obama administration's health insurance mandate faced severe skepticism Tuesday from conservatives on the Supreme Court during a pivotal morning of oral arguments on the landmark legislation.
ADVERTISEMENT
Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's most consistent swing vote, repeatedly voiced doubts about the mandate's constitutionality, suggesting they could side with the court's four staunch conservatives to overturn President Obama's healthcare law.
“That changes the relationship of the federal government to the individual in a very fundamental way,” Kennedy said.
While the court's four liberal justices at times gave a more vigorous defense of the law than the government's lawyer, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., the sense of a possible election-year defeat in the courtroom for the president's signature domestic achievement was unmistakable.
The Hill's Supreme Court coverage:
• AUDIO & TRANSCRIPT: Day 2 arguments
• GOP up, Dems down after mandate talk
• GOP leaders not predicting SCOTUS healthcare decision
• Toobin: Law 'in grave, grave trouble'
• Reid: 'I've been in court a lot more than Jeffrey Toobin'
• Bachmann: We haven't raised 'white flag of surrender on socialized medicine'
• GOP doctors decry health law's 'very bad medicine'
• AUDIO: Alito questions mandate as a tax
Jeffrey Toobin, a lawyer and legal analyst who writes about legal topics for The New Yorker called Tuesday a “train wreck for the Obama administration.”
“This law looks like it's going to be struck down. I'm telling you, all of the predictions, including mine, that the justices would not have a problem with this law were wrong,” Toobin said Tuesday on CNN. “I think this law is in grave, grave trouble.”
The Supreme Court's oral arguments are not always a reliable indication of how the justices will rule, and it's not uncommon for the court's decisions, or specific justices' positions, to go in a different direction than they seemed to be headed during arguments.
Nonetheless, the back and forth Tuesday invigorated Republican lawmakers in attendance, who voiced confidence the court would overturn the new law.
“I would say today the government had a tough day,” said Sen. Mike Johanns Michael (Mike) Owen JohannsMeet the Democratic sleeper candidate gunning for Senate in Nebraska Farmers, tax incentives can ease the pain of a smaller farm bill Lobbying World MORE (R-Neb.). “That was my impression.”
Most Democrats weren't as sunny, though a White House official said the arguments did not shake the administration's confidence that the court will uphold the healthcare law. The official noted that conservative judges in lower courts also asked tough questions during arguments but ultimately ruled that the mandate is constitutional.
Tuesday's session was the centerpiece of the court's historic three-day argument, and the stakes were abundantly clear. Hundreds of protesters rallied outside the Supreme Court building as the courtroom filled up with a who's who of government leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse to push back at Trump on border Democrats block abortion bill in Senate Overnight Energy: Climate protesters storm McConnell's office | Center-right group says Green New Deal could cost trillion | Dire warnings from new climate studies MORE (R-Ky.), White House adviser Valerie Jarrett and Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderObama political arm to merge with Holder-run group Barack, Michelle Obama expected to refrain from endorsing in 2020 Dem primary: report Ocasio-Cortez to be first guest on new Desus and Mero show MORE — Verrilli's boss.
Supporters of the law had seen Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia as possible supporters of the mandate in addition to Kennedy, but the two offered aggressive questions during the two hours of arguments.The debate hinged largely on whether the mandate requires people to enter the market for health insurance or regulates the market for healthcare. Verrilli argued that everyone either uses healthcare or is at risk of unexpectedly ending up in the market for healthcare services. The mandate simply ensures that those services are paid for, they said.
Scalia wasn't buying it.
“I don't agree with you that the relevant market here is health care. You're not regulating health care. You're regulating insurance,” Scalia said. “It's the insurance market that you're addressing and you're saying that some people who are not in it must be in it.”
Roberts also took issue with the way Verrilli framed the case.
“It's good for you in this case to say ‘Oh, it's just insurance.' But once we say that there is a market and Congress can require people to participate in it … or, as you would say, that people are already participating in it -- it seems to me that we can't say there are limitations on what Congress can do under its commerce power,” Roberts said.
Verrilli struggled to articulate their case amid the tough questioning, after beginning the day by stumbling through their opening statement.
The performance left the court's liberal justices at times making a more convincing argument that the mandate is constitutional.
Following an exchange between Verrilli and Scalia, Justice Sonia Sotomayor spent a full two minutes outlining the three main elements of the Justice Department's position, then they asked Verrilli, “Which of these three is your argument? Are all of them your argument?”
Roberts pressed Verrilli to explain where Congress's power to issue new mandates would stop. The lack of a “limiting principle” has dogged the Justice Department's case throughout the process, prompting one lower-court judge to question whether Congress could also require citizens to buy broccoli, because a healthy diet would cut down on healthcare costs.
The Supreme Court justices revived the broccoli analogy and ran through several more, asking whether the government could mandate the purchase of cellphones, gym memberships, cars, prescription drugs or burial insurance.
None of those markets has the same type of cost-shifting that exists in healthcare, Verrilli argued. Federal law requires hospitals to care for people who cannot afford to pay, and the costs of that uncompensated care are passed on to the government and people with insurance.
According to the Justice Department, the decision to go without insurance therefore has a substantial effect on commerce and can be regulated, using a mandate, under the Commerce Clause.
Former Solicitor General Paul Clement, arguing against the healthcare law, said the court would be crossing a new threshold if it decides that Congress can regulate the decision not to buy something.
“The cost-shifting that the government tries to uniquely associate with this market — it's everywhere,” Clement said.
Justice Elena Kagan asked whether Clement might be “cutting the bologna thin” by separating health insurance from healthcare.
“The two are inextricably interlinked,” they said. “We don't get insurance so that we can stare at our insurance certificate. We get it so that we can go and access health care.”
Despite their skepticism while questioning Verrilli, Roberts and Kennedy pressed Clement to respond to the government's position.
“The government tells us … the insurance market is unique. And in the next case, it'll say the next market is unique,” Kennedy said. “But I think it is true that … the young person who is uninsured is uniquely proximately very close to affecting the rates of insurance and the costs of providing medical care in a way that is not true in other industries. That's my concern in the case.”
Conservative judges in lower courts have upheld the mandate on the grounds that healthcare is unique, due to the risk of accidents and the nature of its cost-shifting. Although other goods also get more expensive when people don't buy them, there are few parallels to the requirement to treat uninsured patients.
The mandate is also considered essential to effectively implementing other parts of the healthcare law. Provisions requiring insurance companies to cover sick people, and prohibiting them from charging those patients higher prices, could dramatically raise the price of insurance if not counterbalanced with the mandate.
“That seems to me a self-created problem” that could be solved by not imposing those regulations, Scalia said.

A soak in a steamy tub, surrounded by candles sure seems like a great way to unwind. But new research suggests that burning certain kinds of candles may generate indoor air pollutants.
Frequently lighting many candles in an unventilated space could lead to problems, say the study researchers.
Researchers at South Carolina State University studied petroleum-based and vegetable-source candles to determine their emissions. They let candles from different manufacturers burn for up to six hours in a small box (8 inches x 8 inches x 26 inches), and then collected and analyzed substances released into the air.
They found that paraffin-based candles -- the most popular kind -- emitted toxic chemicals like toluene and benzene. Soybean candles did not, according to the study, which was presented this week at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington, D.C. Candles made of beeswax or soybean tend to make mention of that ingredient on their label; paraffin candles may not.
The researchers say that lighting a paraffin candle once in a while it is unlikely to pose a health threat. However, frequently lighting many candles in an unventilated space could lead to problems, and may aggravate asthma, cause allergy-like symptoms, or irritate the respiratory tract. Health.com: 10 ways to fight indoor mold
However, whether some candles are safer than others is still debatable, according to one expert. "I think there's some controversy out there as to which candles are better than others," says George Thurston, Ph.D., an associate professor of environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine.
Thurston urges people to be prudent about lighting any kind of candle -- whether it's paraffin, beeswax, or soybean -- in an enclosed space. "Just lighting a match to start a candle creates sulfur pollution in the air," they add. "It's one of the big sources of sulfur in the indoor environment, so using a lighter would probably be cleaner." Health.com: Why belly fat is bad for your lungs
While you aren't putting your life on the line by lighting a candle, they say you should exercise at least some caution. "You ought to try to minimize your exposure to paraffin wax candles," says Thurston. "And when you light any kind of candle, you might turn on the exhaust fan; even if it ruins the mood, it vents out the fumes. People just need to use common sense."
Candles are only one potential source of indoor air pollution.
"A lot of household products give off volatile organic compounds, or VOCs," says David Rosenstreich, M.D., the director of the division of allergy and immunology at New York's Montefiore Medical Center. Cleaning products, hair sprays, and mousses all contribute to indoor air pollution. "We live in a highly chemically infused environment where people use tons of products," they add. "Just because it's on the supermarket shelves doesn't mean it's safe."
Central heating and cooling systems, as well as gas fireplaces, can generate indoor air pollution too. "People have these fake fireplaces that are unventilated and the pollution just sits in the room," says Thurston. "You need ventilation, just like you do with candles." Health.com: Air purifier buying guide
People with respiratory problems such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should make an extra effort to cut down on indoor air pollution, says Rosenstreich. And it's easier than it sounds. "You can wipe down your counter with a little soap and water," they say. "You don't need to use these powerful cleaners."
They also suggest ventilating your home as naturally as possible by opening the windows at night once the house has cooled down. "That way you're not breathing in the same old stale air," they say. If you are prone to outdoor allergies, use a filter in your central air and heating systems to cut down on dust.
Simply thinking twice about the chemical products you use in your home can go a long way toward improving air quality. "A lot of things we take for granted aren't really safe at all," Rosenstreich says.
Barbara Miller, a spokesperson for the National Candle Association, says "no candle wax has ever been shown to be dangerous or harmful to human health."
"Paraffin wax is neither toxic nor carcinogenic," says Miller. "All types of properly formulated candle wax have been shown to burn cleanly and safely." Health.com: How to make your own all-natural home cleaners
They note that a 2007 industry-funded study found that none of the candle waxes tested -- including paraffin, soy wax, and beeswax -- produced benzene. The levels of volatile organic compounds were less than 2 percent of the indoor air-quality standard.
In that study, nine 6-ounce candles of each type containing no fragrance or dyes were burned simultaneously in a test chamber. The test simulated four hours of daily burning of one container candle in a room about 1765 cubic feet (50 cubic meters) in size.

I was still very overweight in that video (about 173 pounds), but I was able to teach Eli to ride a two-wheeler. That made every little sacrifice worth it.
If you have seen my weight loss video , then you might recognize this picture:
The reason I chose that picture to represent "determination" was because this was the day that I finally achieved an 8-mile run. I had attempted to run 8 miles two other times, but couldn't quite make it. Then I made the decision that the third attempt was going to be IT, and I was absolutely determined to finish that 8 miles. And I did!! My shirt was soaked in sweat (that was obviously before I discovered the magic of technical shirts!) but you can see the smile on my face and how proud I felt in that moment.
I guess the whole point of this post is that if there is something you want, don't wait for motivation to push you through (because it won't)--find the determination inside of you and DO IT! No excuses ;)
When people learn about my weight loss, aside from wanting to know the magic pill I took (i.e. diet and exercise), they usually ask me, "How did you stay?"The short answer is, I didn't. I didn't even have motivation when I started losing! What I did have, however, was(Um, Katie... isn't that the same thing?)No--they are completely different! Here is the definition from the dictionary:- A motivating force, stimulus, or influence; incentive; drive.- The act of deciding definitely and firmly; firm or fixed intention to achieve a desired end.I believe that motivation is only temporary. You might feel motivated to lose weight by watching weight loss stories on TV, or reading weight loss blogs (like mine!) or seeing a friend who did it. But that motivation only lasts until you are faced with temptation, and then the motivation shoots out the window because you want to eat _____ (fill in the blank). Motivation is that "force" that makes you want to achieve something and gives you drive to do it--but only until you lose that drive.Determination, on the other hand, is "the act of deciding definitely and firmly". It's a DECISION that has no if's, and's, or's. You make the decision to just do it, and you DO IT, motivation be damned.When I finally decided to lose the weight, it wasn't a matter of feeling motivated--because I didn't feel that way at all. I really was sick of dieting and failing; of high hopes being crushed every time I failed; deprivation and restriction... I just wanted to be done with the whole idea of losing weight and just live my life!However, when I wasn't able to teach Noah to ride a two-wheeler because I was too fat to run up and down the street alongside their bike, the fire of determination was lit inside of me. It was no longer an act of feeling motivated (because I still didn't feel motivated)--I just decided that I would, no matter how badly I didn't want to.When I made that decision, it was no longer an issue as to whether I could stay on track--because I was so determined to finally reach the "end" that I wanted/needed. I knew exactly what I needed to do to lose the weight (count calories and make smarter food decisions; exercise); so I did it because that was the decision I had already made.When you feel the fire of determination, you're not making the decision to just "get it done"; you're making the decision toget it's done. This doesn't mean that you're not going to have setbacks along the way; but you will realize that they are just setbacks. You can keep right on going, because you already made the decision to do whatever it takes and not give up.Eight months after I felt that determination, my mom took this video:
Since Colorado opened the floodgates to recreational pot last January, revenues have soared. Estimated sales in August alone totaled $34.1 million, after months of profits in the tens of millions.
Yet the marijuana industry has struggled with what to do with all that green. With pot still illegal on the federal level, many banks and credit unions have hesitated to do business with vendors, despite guidance efforts from the U.S. Departments of the Treasury and Justice. Sellers have continued to operate largely through money orders and ATM withdrawals.
But the banking conundrum may be nearing its end. Last week, Colorado's Division of Financial Services chartered the world's first credit union geared specifically for the weed industry. The Fourth Corner Credit Union could open as soon as January 1, the one-year anniversary of recreational legalization.
Why hadn't this already happened? It's because of a hitherto overlooked piece of Colorado law, which allows state-chartered credit union to operate immediately after applying for required federal insurance from the National Credit Union Administration. Normally, the credit union would have to wait until after obtaining that deposit. Fourth Corner will be able to have its doors open while it waits an estimated two years for NCUA to process.
Fourth Corner Credit Union will be able to operate while it waits an estimated two years for federal insurance—which might never arrive.
The Denver Post reports that Fourth Corner's organizers discovered that legal gem, which state financial services commissioner Chris Myklebust thoroughly vetted before approving the union's charter. "We do like to see all credit unions have federal deposit insurance [before they open]," they say, "but with the need we have here in Colorado to get these businesses' deposits into federal reserve system, it was in everyone's best interest to get this thing going."
Of course, the NCUA could eventually reject Fourth Corner's application for federal insurance, and effectively shut it down. So the credit union will operate precariously, and with bated breath.
A call for help to make special quilts for Fort McMurray fire victims has been answered by quilters across Canada and around the world.
Around the time the northern Alberta city was evacuated because of a devastating wildfire, members of the Ottawa Modern Quilt Guild starting asking people to send them "quilt blocks" with a maple leaf design in the colours of the Alberta flag (red, green, yellow, blue and white) so they could make them into quilts and send them to Fort McMurray.
They were hoping for enough blocks to make 10 quilts but will be sending around 100 of them at the end of October.
"The response right away was incredible... we got [quilt blocks] by the hundreds," said Stacey O'Malley, who moved to Ottawa from Edmonton about a year ago.
"We're talking about people who may have lost their homes, may have lost everything, so as quilters we were thinking of something like a hug or a way to show we care."
The group's president said they got blocks and cards from across Canada and the United States, plus Australia, the United Kingdom and Ireland.
"At first it was overwhelming but now I feel extremely proud," said Amber Mitchener.
A lot of the quilt-making has been happening at two "sew-ins" — one in July and another Sunday at the Kanata Recreation Centre in west Ottawa.
By the time the quilts are all finished at the end of October, O'Malley said they'll be taken to Alberta for free thanks to a connection made with a professional mover in Calgary.
A muse is descending on Willow Lawn.
Muse Paintbar, a company that offers painting classes while students enjoy wine, beer and food, plans to open in February a 2,500-square-foot storefront in the West End shopping center.
Stan Finch and Ray Weaver launched Muse Paintbar in 2012 with a location in New Hampshire. They now have 10 locations either open or in the works. Finch said it could cost up to $1 million to open the Richmond location, Muse's first outside New England and New York state.
Finch said Muse is focusing on expanding its presence around Washington, D.C., and Virginia.
“We thought the population was attractive both for its quality and density,” they said of the area around Willow Lawn.
Muse customers typically sign up for a painting session ahead of time. It costs about $35 to participate. They don't need an art degree to feel comfortable: The painting sessions are led by instructors, and no prior skills are needed.
There are 650 different paintings to choose from, and canvases are provided. Breaks are built into each session, and drinks and tapas-style food are available to order. Class sizes range between 10 and 50 people. Students get to take home their finished paintings.
The Richmond Muse will open near restaurants American Tap Room and Family Meal. The venture is being financed with a combination of debt and equity.
The architect for the space is Connecticut-based Phase Zero Design, which Muse uses for most of its locations. A general contractor has yet to be selected.
Richmond has at least two other ventures that offer social paint classes. Wine and Design at 2707 W. Broad St. and Spirited Art in West Broad Village both opened in recent years.
So I don't know why, but I have over the last year or so really gotten into doing things with renewable resources (mainly solar). Well, lets say interested in. I have a couple of solar panels I play with but nothing crazy.
So one day I get this crazy idea in my head. I need a rain barrel. But for what!?!?! I had no real need for a Rain Barrel. But this suddenly consumed me. I NEEDED a rain barrel. I checked craigslist and found an ad for someone getting rid of one. Just needed to pick it up. DONE!.
Now I had my barrel. Now we need some water collection. I looked around. Rain collection can get expensive. I saw collection systems over $100!!!! That was crazy! That's too much!!!
I came across this Instructable – Rain Barrel and Diverter
This was right up my alley. A couple bucks later I had a bunch of PVC and one saturday (when my step-dad was in town) we threw it together in no time. Tested it out…. yes, I sprayed my waterhose on the roof to test it. What's it to you!?!?
So then when I regained my proper maturity level we waited for a storm.
Hahah b%^&*es I live in FL. It rains like every 17 minutes during the summer. So that night my son and I being the geniuses we are, well, they were just following me, went outside with the flashlight to see how our water collection was doing. Very surprisingly with just one section of gutter we were getting alot of water fast. Before morning the barrel was full.
Here is what my setup currently looks like.
This works surprisingly well. However, I haven't gotten to the point. What am I doing with a 55 gallon drum of water. Well, nothing…. yet. Well, we used it a couple times as a sprinkler for the kids over the summer.
I built a little test rig to test out some sprinkler heads, and the kids and dog just ran around in it. But it worked with my little pump I got from harbor freight.
This is the one I have. Water Pump. I got this little pump specifically for a couple reasons.
Cheap. This little guy was 40 bucks. 12v. Why does that matter? Because I want to power it off a 12v battery.
I'm sure at this point you are thinking “OK there guy. So you have a bunch of water, you have a pump that can run off a battery and you have some sprinkler heads. So what are you getting at…… ”
You hear that? That was the click of it all coming together. I am making a self sustaining green sprinkler system. Rain Barrel to collect the water. Battery charged from a solar panel to power the pump. Easy right? No. No. No.
Getting in to researching solar and batteries has forced me to start working on a charge controller circuit for the battery to avoid over charging or over discharging. Why not buy it? Harbor Freight has some. You are right, but I am cheap and just buying stuff would make for this to be a really boring blog. I would just upload receipts all day. No spank you. This is more fun!
So where am I in this whole ordeal? Well, not as far along as I would like to be. But I recently was able to test the actual pressure of my pump. It claims a max of 50psi. Which is close to the pressure to your house. But I needed to see some numbers and here they are! That's actually higher than I expected considering how rough this pump sounds these days. I tested a few times and always 30psi or higher. This is actually really good news. This means I should have a decent water pressure for my sprinkler heads. I do not have a large front yard, but I am still looking at 5-6 heads to get the coverage. In the next week or so I will be modifying my test rig to support 5 heads and see if I can run all 5 or if I need to split it into zones. I am not opposed to doing the zones split, but it would be easier not to.
So that's where I am. The plans as I finish this are below.
The Battle of Lerin or Battle of Florina or Chegan offensive was an offensive operation of the Bulgarian army during the First World War between 17–28 August 1916 in which they conquered the city of Florina (in present-day Greece but in Bulgaria known as Lerin), but failed to take Chegan.
Background [ edit ]
In August 1916 Romania chose to join the war effort on the side of the Entente. The Allies planned a large offensive in the Macedonian Front for the middle of August in order to support Romania's entry in the war and pin down as many Bulgarian forces as possible. The Bulgarian high command suspected an impending offensive and the fighting around Doiran that erupted on 9 August only confirmed these suspicions. On their part the Bulgarians had urged for an offensive in Macedonia since the beginning of the year and now planned a strike with the First Army and Second Army on both Allied flanks.
The Struma operation on the eastern flank by the Bulgarian Second Army under general Todorov was a huge success, mainly because the Greek government ordered their troops not to resist.
Chegan operation [ edit ]
The advance on the right flank was to be undertaken by the Bulgarian First Army which had the following order of battle in July 1916:
First Army Order of Battle Battalions Men Rifles Machine guns Cannons Army Staff, rear services etc. 13,361 5,524 Eighth "Tundzha" Infantry Division 22 41,376 22,538 36 48 3/6 Infantry Brigade 10 8,029 6,491 12 12 Third Cavalry Brigade 1,892 1,310 4 Third "Balkan" Infantry Division 21 42,777 26,953 36 48 Army Units (15th IR, reserves etc.) 4 7,946 7,000 20 66 German Units 1,987 987 24 12 Total 57 117,368 70,803 128 190
The Germans finally agreed that an offensive was needed and on 12 August general Boyadzhiev received their orders from the headquarters of Army Group "Mackensen". The right wing of the army, consisting of the reinforced 8th infantry division (four and half infantry brigades,) was to advance and take Lerin while parts of the 3rd division towards the Chegan mountain range and the village of the same name (today known as Agios Athanasios, to the north-west of Lake Vegoritida, in the Greek regional unit of Pella). General Boyadzhiev agreed to attack but had concerns regarding the final results of the offensive because their army was scattered on a 140 km front and lacked enough mountain and heavy artillery. Facing the Bulgarians were the six infantry and one cavalry divisions of the three Serbian armies.
The offensive began on 17 August 1916 with the Bulgarians taking Lerin and Banitsa. The advance however soon ran into difficulty and slowed down considerably due to the increased Serbian resistance. The fighting was especially heavy on the bare rocky slopes of the Chegan Mountain and the Voras Mountains. The Serbians were constantly reinforced with new artillery and fresh troops thanks to railway that reached the battlefield while the Bulgarians soon began depleting their ammunition stocks. This and the slow advance forced the Bulgarian high command to call off all attacks on 27 August and order the forces to dig in on the occupied positions between Lake Vegoritida, Lake Petron and along the ridges of the Voras Mountains . For the next several days the Bulgarian positions were subjected to heavy artillery fire and few Serbian attacks that were repulsed.
Consequences [ edit ]
The Chegan Offensive also known as the Lerin Offensive had failed. It failed to influence Romania which entered the war on the side of the Allies, but also failed to achieve its final military objective to take the Chegan village and the pass north of Lake Ostrovo.
French General Maurice Sarrail now prepared a counterattack against the First Bulgarian Army that would eventually develop in the Monastir Offensive. Lerin/Florina was retaken by the French on 23 September 1916.

You are the man. Or the woman.
Either way, hearty congratulations are in order. If you are reading this, you are playing for something this week. In Week 16, that's to be acknowledged and applauded.
"Yeah, yeah," you're saying, "I rule. Whatever. Not done yet. Gimme some ranks." I hear you, my Internet friend, and I'm right there with you. There will be plenty of time for celebration, self-high-fiving and reflection. Now is not that time. Now is the time to focus. To really think about every roster move. And by every roster move, I mean every ... single ... roster ... move.
This is a crucial time, and ask anyone standing on the virtual sidelines this week and I'm sure they will tell you that there's at least one move they wish they had back. Peyton Manning is as sure a thing as there is in fantasy football and yet, over the past five weeks, Peyton is averaging 14.2 fantasy points a game, the same amount as their brother and fewer than Teddy Bridgewater's 14.8. Manning is tied for 15th in fantasy points per game scoring as the Broncos have gone more run-heavy and, with a tough road matchup at Cincinnati, it's fair to wonder if there are better options out there. I still have Manning as a top-10 quarterback this week, but he's not top three for me, which, earlier this season, would have been unthinkable.

“I JUST want to see the button, ok? That's what I do, I just look at buttons, I don't touch them. Check the records, I'm the best at looking at buttons without touching them,” said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump earlier this week, amid concerns that the billionaire could be eager to launch nuclear weapons should they achieve their goal of presidency in the upcoming US election.
“Guys, you know me, you know I'm a business person, OK? And in business, you just have to know what buttons are there, and what they look like” added Trump, midway through a debate on healthcare.
“That's all. I'm not saying I would push the button and launch nuclear weapons, come on. That's not me. Ask anybody. I'm the best at not nuking other countries. The. Best. Nobody doesn't nuke other countries the way I don't”
“It's not even a contest. But yeah, I'm going to need to see that button. Just look at it. You can put a big ‘do not touch' sticker on it. Go ahead. I won't touch it”.
Trump's insistence that they won't touch the button was met with concern from all sides, including one man who witnessed Trump in 2008 deliberately touching a freshly painted wall despite it clearly being signposted as “Wet Paint”.
A bill to legalize same-sex marriage passed the first of four votes in order to become law in Colombia
A bill legalizing gay marriage past the first of four votes amid criticism from conservative groups.
The bill was was approved on Tuesday (4 November) by 10 votes against five senators of the first committee of the Senate responsible for constitutional matters, reported the portal Univision.
The bill will now face a vote in the Colombian Senate however no date was yet set for a debate and vote.
Senator Armando Benedetti, of the ruling Social Party of National Unity party said: ‘The marriage of couples of same-sex couples is a clear manifestation of respect and non-discrimination of groups that have been permanently marginalized.
‘With this initiative we seek to bridge the gap of inequality and respect the provisions of the constitution and the rulings of the constitutional court'.
Last year (26 July 2011) Colombia's constitutional court set a deadline for lawmakers to act on the issue.
The court ruled that the Colombian Congress must create an equivalent of marriage for gay couples by June 20, 2013, or else couples will automatically gain the right to go to any judge or notary public to formalize their union.
The vote was strongly criticized by conservative politicians.
Conservative party spokesperson, Senator HernÃ¡n Andrade stated: ‘we must think about legislating as 26% which is in agreement with these issues, while the majority have to keep silent. This is the dictatorship of the minority'.
Andrade called the bill to be put to a referendum to see if a majority of Colombians would support the bill.
Bills legalizing same-sex marriage have already been proposed and defeated six times in the Colombian Congress and religious conservatives remain resolutely opposed to the legislation.
Thanks to three rulings (made in the years 2007-2008) by the constitutional court, LGBT people can register civil partnerships in Colombia which includes inheritance rights, pension and social security.
For many activists in Grand Rapids, “thoughts and prayers” going out to gun violence victims and those close to them are not enough. These citizens have chosen to add protest, action, education, and organization to tackle the shootings that have devastated families across the city, state and country.
Another day. Another shooting. An ordinary day in the United States of America. In 2014, there were almost 34,000 people killed by guns in the United States, according to GunPolicy.org , an international firearm injury prevention and policy organization. Two hundred-eighty people were killed in mass shootings.
In Michigan there were 6,729 gun deaths between 2008 and 2013, according to the most recent data available from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. About half of these were suicides. In Kent County, there were 229 deaths from firearms during the same time period. Look in almost any week's issue of the Grand Rapids Press, and
there's sure to be at least one reported shooting in our community.
These statistics are facts. The deaths behind the statistics are devastating. Mothers have lost their sons. Wives have lost their husbands. Children have lost their parents. Families, friends and communities have been rocked by the loss of loved ones.
For many activists in Grand Rapids, “thoughts and prayers” going out to victims and those close to them are not enough. These citizens have chosen to add protest, action, education, and organization to thoughts and prayers.
Lamont Cole, Director of Education for the Urban League of Grand Rapids , says their organization "is working with the police department, the city of Grand Rapids and organizations throughout the community to effect change. We realize that guns too often end up in the hands of young people within the urban community and lead to dire consequences. Part of our mission is to insure the safety of our community. We want people to be safe and to understand the responsibilities of gun ownership and the unfortunate outcome when these responsibilities are ignored. Understanding that gun violence disproportionately affects people of color, we will continue our efforts for all citizens.”
Grand Rapidians Teresa Ward and Darnella Powell founded Mothers Against Street Killings (MASK) in 2005 after the death of an 18-year-old young man who was the nephew of Ward and the son of Powell. The group organized a city-wide peace march that drew a large crowd. Since then, they have worked with other organizations to bring awareness and attention to the costs of gun violence.
“We work to promote love, peace and unity in the community through Stop the Violence events," Ward says. "We are aware that MASK will not be able to stop the violence, but if we are able to prevent even one act, we know that two lives have been saved—one from the grave and one from the legal system.”
A revitalized Moms Demand Action-West Michigan held its first event in December, on the anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre. A silent vigil and candlelit march from Fountain Street Church to Rosa Parks Circle was preceded by an event at the church, which was attended by close to 200 people. They heard from Mary Alice Williams, a long-time community activist; Dr. Erica Michiels, Associate Medical Director of DeVos Children's Hospital Emergency Medicine; Jerline Riley, who founded Mothers on a Mission , a survivor network, after they lost their son to gun violence; and the Women's Chorus of Grand Rapids.
Other events have included an informational session for parents on protecting their children from gun violence; Moms Demand Action's “care-in," at the Fountain Street Church, where participants wrote cards and letters expressing support and sorrow to the citizens of Kalamazoo after a recent mass shooting there; and a presentation of the movie “3 ½ Minutes, 10 Bullets," a documentary about a killing in Florida during which a man, angered by loud music, shot into a car carrying four unarmed youth, killing one of them, 17-year-old Jordan Davis.
“We want reasonable measures taken that will protect our children and all families throughout the country from gun violence," Moms Demand Action
Gun violence is increasing throughout Michigan and the United States, and we need to make changes that will decrease the incidence of death and destruction caused by guns. We value the Second Amendment, but we also value the lives of all Americans."
“Members of Moms Demand Action are available to make presentations to community groups concerning gun safety," they continue. "Our goal is to educate the public, advocate for common sense gun laws and make our country safer.”
Natalie Pochert, the coordinator of the local chapter of Moms Demands Action, says their organization "will continue to support legislation for reasonable, responsible gun control in the hopes that other families won't have to go through the loss of a loved one. As the national chapter says, ‘This is a marathon, not a sprint.' Our efforts may bring about change slowly, but we must not give up in our goal of making this a better, more peaceful and safer community.”
Moms Demand Action will host a Family Day at Fountain Street Church on April 24 from 1pm to 3pm, during which there will be games and other children's activities. They are also planning to participate in Lobby Day, a state-wide effort. Gun control advocates will meet throughout the day with their elected officials in Lansing.
There are currently several gun-related bills in the Michigan Legislature. During Lobby Day, they will be advocating for the passage of Bill 5443 and against the other three. The bills currently being considered are:
Bill 5304, which would allow concealed carry without a government –issued permit.
Bill 442, which would allow guns in K-12 schools, college dorms and classrooms, bars, daycare centers, sports arenas, places of worship, hospitals and entertainment facilities.
Bill 4795, which would give special-interest groups such as the NRA the power to sue local governments for enforcing gun laws and entitles them to large payouts from those governments.
Bill 5443, which would prohibit the sale to and possession of firearms to people on the federal terrorist watch list.

British prime minister Theresa May outlined on Tuesday (18 January) a strategy leading to a so-called hard Brexit from the EU.
"What I'm proposing cannot mean membership of the single market," they said in a speech to ambassadors called Plan for Britain.
They explained that the UK could not accept the four freedoms of goods, capital, services and people attached to the single market
"Being out of the EU but a member of the single market would mean complying with the EU's rules and regulations that implement those freedoms, without having a vote on what those rules and regulations are," they pointed out.
They insisted that the message from British voters was clear: "Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver."
May added that a post-Brexit UK could not accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
"We will not have truly left the European Union if we are not in control of our own laws," they said, adding that "leaving the European Union will mean that our laws will be made in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast".
No new Norway
Faced with a risk of another independence referendum in Scotland and difficulties to continue implementing the peace agreement in Northern Ireland, the British prime minister tried to reassure the different parts of the UK.
They insisted that the devolved administrations "should be fully engaged" in the Brexit process and that they would work with the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
They said they would work to find "a practical solution that allows the maintenance of the common travel area" between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
"Nobody wants to return to the borders of the past," they said.
To replace Britain's EU and single market membership, May said they would seek "the greatest possible access" to the single market through a "new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement".
They said that, in their view, the deal could build upon some elements of the single market membership, because "it makes no sense to start again from scratch when Britain and the remaining member states have adhered to the same rules for so many years".
However, they warned that "the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end", suggesting they ruled out the so-called Norwegian model of access to the single market.
They also warned that a "punitive deal that punishes Britain and discourages other countries from taking the same path" would be "calamitous self-harm" for the remaining EU countries.
"Britain would not, indeed we could not, accept such an approach," they said, adding that "no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain."
They said however that they were "confident that a positive agreement can be reached".
A day after the US president-elect expressed support for Brexit and said that other countries would leave the EU, the British PM insisted that Brexit was "no attempt to do harm to the EU itself or to any of its remaining member states".
"We will continue to be reliable partners, willing allies and close friends," they said, adding that "Britain's unique intelligence capabilities will continue to help to keep people in Europe safe from terrorism".
'Come together' plea
May's speech was the most expansive view of what their government's strategy will be when it triggers article 50 - the EU treaty clause to start exit talks - before the end of March.
It comes two weeks after Britain's EU ambassador quit and criticised the government's lack of strategy.
But May said they would not be "pressured into saying more than I believe it is in our national interest to say" and that "every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for Britain".
The speech also comes as the High Court is expected to rule soon over whether the British parliament should vote before article 50 is triggered.
In a gesture to parliament, May said that both the House of Commons and the House of Lords would vote on the final Brexit deal before it comes into force.
They said after a "divisive" referendum the country must "come together".
"The victors have the responsibility to act magnanimously. The losers have the responsibility to respect the legitimacy of the outcome," they said.
Hillary Clinton writes in their new memoir that their election night phone call with Donald Trump was “without a doubt one of the strangest moments of my life,” CNN reports.
Clinton wrote that they were “numb” during the call.
“I congratulated Trump and offered to do anything I could to make sure the transition was smooth,” they wrote in “What Happened.”
“It was all perfectly nice and weirdly ordinary, like calling a neighbor to say you can't make it to their barbecue. It was mercifully brief … I was numb. It was all so shocking,” they wrote, according to CNN, which obtained the book early.
CNN also reported that Clinton's book, “oozes with contempt for Trump, the campaign they ran and the President they have become.”
Clinton's book has been swiping at all kinds of people whom they perceive as responsible for their loss.
Bernie Sanders' campaign was taken to task for causing “lasting damage” and “[paving] the way” for Donald Trump's portrayal of Clinton as crooked.
Meanwhile, Clinton remarked on the “so-called Bernie Bros” and how some of them allegedly “harassed” Clinton supporters online. (RELATED: Hillary's Latest Wrath Falls In Bernie's Lap)

Real Madrid Fitness coach previously worked with Zidane at Juventus
A deal to bring fitness coach Antonio Pintus to Real Madrid is being thrashed out despite the fact that the Italian signed a contract with Lyon just a few days ago.
The call from Real Madrid has made 53-year-old re-consider the agreement they had already made with Lyon, especially after a special request for their services was made by Zinedine Zidane, who Pintus first met when the two of them were with Juventus.
Even though the deal is not done yet, MARCA and Foot Mercato believe that the negotiations are dominated by the French club requiring financial compensation for the Italian.
Despite the contract that Pintus has signed with Lyon, it can be broken with 15 days notice, although the Ligue 1 club are not especially happy about the possibility of not having a fitness coach just two weeks ahead of the start of the season.
Antonio Pintus has previously worked at Marseille, Monaco, Udinese, Juventus and Chelsea.
IN 2014, a local official in Aichi prefecture set out a daring proposal. Tomonaga Osada suggested that the authorities could distribute secretly punctured condoms to young married couples, who would then get to work boosting the birth rate. Their unorthodox ploy won few supporters, yet it reflected growing concern about Japan's demographic plight. In 2014, just over 1 million babies were born, far fewer than the number needed to maintain the population, which is expected to drop from 127 million to around 87 million by 2060. Why are young Japanese so loth to procreate?

The spiral of demographic decline is spinning faster as the number of women of child-bearing age falls. Some 500 towns across the country are expected to disappear by 2040 as young women migrate to bigger cities. The workforce is already shrinking, endangering future growth. In recent years governments have embarked on a plethora of schemes to encourage childbearing, including a “women's handbook” to educate young females on the high and low points of their fertility, and state-sponsored matchmaking events.
The chief reason for the dearth of births is the decline of marriage. Fewer people are opting to wed, and those who do are getting married later in life. At least a third of young women aim to become full-time housewives, yet they struggle to find men who can support a traditional family. In better economic times potential suitors had permanent jobs as part of Japan's “lifetime employment” system. Now many of them have to rely on temporary or part-time work. Other women shun marriage and children because Japan's old-fashioned corporate culture, together with a dire shortage of child care, forces them to give up their careers if they have children. Finally, young people are bound by strict social codes. Only around 2% of babies are born outside marriage (compared with 30–50% in most of the rich world), which means that as weddings plummet, so do births. And even for those who do start families, the rising cost of child-rearing often imposes a de facto one-child policy.
There is little the government can do directly to boost productivity in the bedroom. Yet labour-market reforms could make a difference to the birth rate in the long term. If companies gave more protection to new, young hires and reduced the privileges of other employees, young couples would have a more stable basis on which to marry and raise families. The government of Shinzo Abe has talked about such steps, but has shied away from taking them. Instead Mr Abe is acting to help women combine careers with child-rearing. Many demographers reckon it is already too late to lift Japan's birth rate, now at 1.41 children per woman. The eventual answer, they say, will be even more shocking to Japanese society than sabotaged prophylactics: mass immigration.

If you need any evidence of Netflix's ongoing dominance in the online streaming space, look no further than the sheer amount of bandwidth the service eats up relative to everyone else. According to recent data compiled by Sandvine, Netflix-related bandwidth — measured during peak hours — now accounts for 37.05% of all Internet traffic in North America.
DON'T MISS: Apple's secrets: How Apple's legal fight with Samsung revealed a gold mine of top-secret information
To truly appreciate this figure, consider this: the bandwidth consumed by Netflix users during peak hours is greater than the bandwidth seen from YouTube, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and iTunes combined. Indeed, the service that comes closest to matching Netflix is YouTube, which comes in second with a 17.85% share of Internet traffic.
More broadly, the chart below relays that a good 70% of downstream bandwidth is associated with streaming video and audio services.
Speaking to this new era of streaming services, Sandvine CEO Dave Caputo said:
Streaming Video has grown at such a rapid pace in North America that the leading service in 2015, Netflix, now has a greater share of traffic than all of streaming audio and video did five years ago.
While bandwith from sites like Netflix, YouTube, and Facebook all increased over the past few months, the sites that enjoyed the largest gains were Amazon Video and Hulu, with 3.11% and 2.58% shares respectively. By way of contrast, the bandwidth eaten up by each service just six months ago came in at 2% and 1.9%, clearly indicating that both sites are becoming much more popular with viewers.
Per usual, one of the more interesting takeaways from Sandvine's report is how quickly BitTorrent is fading into irrelevancy. Thouth Sandvine's data points to BitTorrent accounting for 5% of total Internet traffic in North America, remember that filesharing sites back in 2011 accounted for 22% of Internet traffic. Going back just a bit further, filesharing sites accounted for nearly 33% of Internet traffic in 2008.
Of course, it shouldn't come as a surprise that BitTorrent has been trending downwards as affordable, easy to use, and compelling streaming services have proliferated over the past few years.
Speaking to this point, Sandvine's Dan Deeth concisely articulated the shifting trend in consumer viewing habits last year.
People have shifted their activities to streaming over file sharing, Subscribers get quality content at a reasonable price and it's dead simple to use, whereas torrenting or file sharing is a little more complicated.
Solid points all around.
Interestingly, the data looks a whole lot different when it comes to mobile bandwidth, with YouTube and Facebook dominating with a combined 36.74% share. Netflix, meanwhile, only checks in with a 3.44% share.
A winery with a solar array in rural Oregon. A greenhouse in Montana tapping geothermal energy. A farm in Kansas that deployed an energy-efficient irrigation system. These are just a few of the more than 15,000 small businesses and family farms around the country that have received a clean energy boost from an unexpected source: the United States Department of Agriculture.
The funding to make these projects a reality comes in part from the USDA's Rural Energy for America Program, which offers small businesses and farms—often left on the sidelines when it comes to new technology—the opportunity to invest in either renewable energy sources or energy-efficient equipment.
Collectively, the REAP projects installed to date have reduced the greenhouse emissions of these rural businesses by more than 5 million metric tons per year. “That's the equivalent to removing more than a million cars from the year annually,” said Samuel Rikkers, administrator of the USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service, which runs the program.
Many of these projects may not have been possible without REAP assistance. Jason Delaney, landscape project manager at Delany's Landscape Center in Polson, Montana, said the geothermal heat pump the company installed at its new retail building at first looked prohibitively expensive. “The grant and all of the rebates from the power company made it so that it's actually a really good thing for us,” they said. The system costs about $50 a month in electric costs, compared with $200 to $300 a month for a propane-fueled boiler. The system is expected to pay for itself in four to five years, compared with 10 years without REAP assistance.
“It's good for the business and good for the environment,” Delaney said.
REAP isn't a “free ride,” Rikkers pointed out. Program grants can cover up to 25 percent of a project's cost; the recipient must provide the rest. Loan guarantees address 90 percent of a project's funding, which enables banks to offer lower rates and longer repayment terms. All told, REAP has provided more than $345 million in grants and $430 million in loan guarantees since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.
Rikkers said REAP helps to make sure that rural businesses have the same opportunities as urban businesses to invest in renewable energy. Filling that need is important, they said, not just for the climate but for the rural companies. “Too often folks might see the issues of renewable energy or energy efficiency as a cultural one,” they said. “I don't think it is. I spend a lot of my time in small, rural spaces, and folks really care about the environment where they live. They care about saving money for their businesses. So the farming family that might not self-identify as politically liberal will be one of the first to tell you how much business sense it makes and how important it is for the land they've been working on to have solar panels all over their chicken farm or highly efficient heating and air-conditioning equipment throughout their facility.”

Related Oregon Finds Switching From Coal to Renewable Energy Is a Bargain
Pattie Björnson, co-owner of Björnson Vineyard in Salem, Oregon, said the winery has installed a hybrid solar system that generates electricity and hot water. “Heating and cooling a winery is extremely expensive,” they said. “It was a lot of work writing the grant application, but it was worth it.” They said the local energy utility buys the energy produced by the winery's solar photovoltaic system, which pays the vineyard's entire electric bill during summer months.
Rikkers said rural farms and companies are a natural fit for renewable energy. For one thing, they have a lot of land that can be devoted to solar arrays or wind turbines. For another, they may have great quantities of biomass—either crops or animal waste—that can be converted into electricity. They said several farms they had visited had installed anaerobic digesters and now convert so much manure into electricity that all their power demand is met. “They are capturing energy as opposed to using it,” they said. “It's super exciting.”
They added that the investment in new technologies helps to boost small-town economies at a time when many young people are leaving for cities. “It keeps these rural towns and communities really vibrant, so we're not a country dotted by these very empty places,” they said.
Although it hasn't drawn much publicity on a national level, REAP has proved popular enough that it can't quite fulfill demand. “The program has been oversubscribed for years now,” Rikkers said. “In the 2015 fiscal year, there were nearly 1,000 applications totaling more than $50 million that we couldn't fund for the grant program.”
Rikkers added that he's been excited to see the REAP program do so well because they come from a small town and spends so much time visiting rural communities. “Renewable energy and a commitment to energy efficiency are not an urban issue or a rural issue,” they said. “They're both.”
The U.S. Department of Education is turning its back on at least 1,000 borrowers in favor of shielding their former colleges from potentially crippling sanctions that would have resulted from high rates of default on federal student loans.
The move, announced late Tuesday and further detailed on Wednesday, concerns an Obama administration decision not to punish as many as 20 schools for loan defaults caused by questionable servicing practices overseen by the Education Department.
Borrowers, however, were provided no such relief. The estimate of the number of affected borrowers is only a small subset of those with loans in default as a result of questionable servicing practices the Education Department identified on Tuesday.
"Borrowers aren't getting any relief or similar consideration from the Education Department," said Debbie Cochrane, research director at the California-based Institute for College Access & Success, which advocates affordable education. "If the school isn't held accountable for the default, then the borrower shouldn't either."
As many as 20 schools won't lose access to critical federal student aid programs, an Education Department official said Wednesday. Losing access to taxpayer-provided student aid would be the equivalent of a death sentence for most colleges. The institutions that were let off the hook include for-profit schools, private and public colleges, and historically black colleges and universities, the official said on a conference call organized for news media.
The department did not specify the number of schools aided by its new policy. Nor would it make officials available for a subsequent interview, or answer emailed questions.
The Huffington Post identified 13 schools that may have been affected by the policy shift. Seven are for-profit institutions, four are historically black colleges, and two are community colleges. Only one -- Frank Phillips College, a community college in Borger, Texas -- confirmed that it was aided by the Education Department's decision. Another -- Maysville Community and Technical College, a community college in Maysville, Kentucky -- said it assumed it was helped by the move.
Borrower advocates, experts on federal student aid programs, and one prominent congressional Democrat denounced the Education Department's decision, accusing it of putting the interests of for-profit schools over those of borrowers in distress. It is likely to further cement the reputation of an Education Department that is seen as valuing its contractors and colleges over students.
The Education Department showed "absolutely no concern for borrowers," said Maura Dundon, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending.
"Any changes in the student loan system that reduce transparency and consistency may compromise our ability to hold poor-performing colleges accountable," said Rep. George Miller of California, the top Democrat on the House education committee. "The department should be doing everything it can to ensure student borrowers who have defaulted have every opportunity for redress."
The Education Department decision relates to the share of borrowers who default on a loan within the first three years they are required to make payments, a measurement known as the "cohort default rate" that the department employs to determine colleges' effectiveness, and whether they're improperly taking advantage of taxpayer programs.
When calculating that figure, the Education Department said it won't count certain borrowers who defaulted on one of their federal student loans, but remained in good standing on their other Education Department debt, Jeff Baker, a senior official at the Education Department's Federal Student Aid office, wrote in a memo published online.
The reason has to do with so-called split-servicing, or a situation in which the Education Department has assigned a borrower's loans to multiple specialists that collect monthly payments. In November 2011, Cynthia Battle, an Education Department official, told college financial aid administrators that some 500,000 borrowers with federal student loans were being forced to make multiple monthly payments to different loan companies.
Education Secretary Arne Duncan told Congress in December 2011 that borrowers who have to make monthly payments to multiple companies are more likely to default. Typical borrowers who don't consolidate their debts have multiple federal student loans -- at least one for each year of schooling.
Jee Hang Lee, vice president for public policy and external relations for the Association of Community College Trustees, said they heard of one borrower who had to deal with five loan servicers.
Borrowers are forced to deal with multiple servicers for a variety of reasons. In some instances, they took out Education Department-guaranteed loans from banks under the Federal Family Education Loan program, or FFEL -- before Congress ended the program in 2010 -- then returned to school in recent years and took out new loans under the Direct Loan program.
Another example includes undergraduate student borrowers who entered school in the fall of 2008. These borrowers may have taken out FFEL loans from banks for the first two years of college, then got loans directly from the Education Department for their junior and senior years.
The Education Department says it has tried to ensure that all student borrowers only deal with one company when making their loan payments. For example, it has put an emphasis on borrowers with Direct loans and FFEL loans owned by the Education Department, which it purchased under a 2008 financial crisis-era law that amounted to a $110 billion bailout of the student loan industry, according to figures cited by Baker.
Still, many of those borrowers are making payments to multiple loan servicers. Borrowers with Direct loans and FFEL loans that are owned by banks also are most certainly making monthly payments to multiple loan servicers.
The Education Department has not disclosed a recent count of borrowers forced to make payments to multiple loan servicers, or how many of them may be in default on just a portion of their federal student debt.
In their memo, Baker of the Education Department wrote that among borrowers forced to make payments to multiple loan servicers, some are in default on one of their loans, but in good standing on other federal student loans. In other words, borrowers are making payments to one of the department's loan servicers, but not to another.
Deanne Loonin, director of the National Consumer Law Center's Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project, said borrowers may be falling victim to incompetent loan servicing practices.
"If it's because of servicer incompetency, why not give the borrowers rather than the schools a break?" Loonin said.
"The department is taking multiple steps to help borrowers better understand their repayment options, including working to expand income-driven options for borrowers," Denise Horn, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement. "We're also working closely with our servicers, conducting our own targeted outreach, and working to improve our counseling tools to ensure all borrowers have the information they need to keep all of their loans in good standing."
Last year, in a move celebrated by the White House, the Obama administration directly emailed millions of borrowers, urging them to consider repayment plans that would cap their monthly payments based on earnings. Borrower advocates said they were unaware of any similar efforts directed at borrowers who were behind on one set of their federal student debt, but current on their other Education Department loans. Horn didn't respond to questions regarding the details of the department's efforts.
Jee Hang Lee, vice president for public policy and external relations for the Association of Community College Trustees, said they had heard from numerous borrowers who thought they were current on their federal student loans, only to learn that they were in default on a loan they didn't know was being serviced by another company.
"Think about it: You're dealing with the servicer who were referred to by you college, you're current, and you think you're golden, right? Then, all of a sudden, you get this spam-ish email telling you you're in default on a loan you didn't know about," Lee said, noting that their organization had heard from many students who were current on one or multiple loans but didn't know they were in default on another.
Lee said the community colleges group had previously warned the Education Department about defaults caused by split-servicing. The group was worried that its member colleges would be punished for what they described as improper loan servicing.
"There was no real response," Lee said of the Education Department's reaction to their group's warnings.
The Education Department had earlier notice that a problem was brewing.
In recent years, ITT Technical Institutes, a for-profit school operated by ITT Educational Services, successfully challenged its default figures by pointing to defaults among borrowers whose loans were serviced by multiple entities, said Nicole Elam, an ITT spokesperson.
Schools whose former students subsequently default on their federal student loans at unacceptably high rates can cost their current and future students access to federal grant and loan programs. Penalties kick in once a school's default rate exceeds 30 percent over three straight years.
In their memo, Baker said that some schools were able to avoid sanctions as a result of the department's decision. Some will maintain access to federal student loans, while others will maintain access to federal grants meant for low-income students, they said.
Experts said schools slated to lose access to federal loans or grants will almost assuredly close down.
Frank Phillips College could have been one of them. Jud Hicks, the school's president, said the college challenged the Education Department over its reported default figures. For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, Frank Phillips College had default rates over 30 percent.
Hicks said that among their school's reported defaults, a significant number were for borrowers who were dealing with multiple loan servicers.
Split-servicing was the common thread that connected many of the school's reported loan defaults, Hicks said. Some of their former students were dealing with at least three loan servicers for their federal student loans, they added.
The department's decision not to hold Frank Phillips College responsible for those defaults caused the school's default rate to fall from 31.1 percent in 2010 to 25.2 percent. In 2009, the rate fell from an original 34.1 percent to 29.1 percent, Education Department data show.
"I can sympathize with the confusion caused by multiple servicers," Hicks said. "If I'm the student and I'm at home and I get a letter saying, 'Here's your loan balance, here are your servicers, please make payments,' and then three months later I get another letter from another company, then another letter six months later from yet another company, I'm wondering, 'Who do I pay, and how much?'"
Jessica Kern, a spokesperson for Maysville Community and Technical College, said the school's default figures were adjusted without any prompting from the school. The Education Department simply told the school it wouldn't face any sanctions as a result of its default rates, a move Kern assumed was due to the department's decision to not count defaults from borrowers who were forced to deal with multiple loan servicers.
But community colleges weren't the only schools to benefit. Arkansas Baptist College, Central State University, Jarvis Christian College, and Texas College -- all historically black schools -- also had their default figures revised downward. It wasn't clear why. Representatives for Arkansas Baptist couldn't be reached for comment. Representatives for the other three schools didn't respond to requests for comment.
The mere fact that some schools dodged punishment as a result of the change is an indication that there are a large number of borrowers who have defaulted on at least one of their loans because of split-servicing, experts said.
Baker dryly noted in their memo that even though schools were let off the hook, "the borrowers' defaulted loan remains in its current status for collection and other purposes."
Borrowers in default on at least one of their federal student loans face high collection fees, damaged credit scores, an inability to secure home mortgages or auto loans, and garnishment of their tax refunds and Social Security payments, said Cochrane of the Institute for College Access & Success.
A recent federal audit revealed that the Education Department is demanding so much money from seniors with defaulted student loans that it's forcing tens of thousands of them into poverty. At least 105,000 Americans had a part of their Social Security benefits garnished last year to the point that their monthly benefits were below federal poverty thresholds, according to the Government Accountability Office.
"Borrowers have no control over who services their loans. So why not remove the defaults from the borrowers' records as well?" Cochrane said.
In commentary published online, analysts at the New America Foundation questioned the rationale behind the Education Department's decision, lamenting the "message such a move sends about prioritizing institutions over students."
"The institutions churning out borrowers who don't repay their loans in such high numbers that the federal government takes notice are granted excuses from government regulations," wrote Ben Miller, a former senior policy adviser under Arne Duncan at the Education Department, and Clare McCann. "There's no indication, though, that the borrowers who have to deal with the consequences of a defaulted loan are getting any similar assistance in terms of making that loan automatically current or discharging any collection costs. If the default is not the colleges' fault, why isn't the student helped also?"
For much of Tuesday, the country joined in rare collective outrage at the viral image of comedian Kathy Griffin holding aloft a mock bloody severed head of President Trump. Politicos from the left and right side of the spectrum shared a sense of disgust over the image that some equated to promoting violence, while one writer for The Atlantic didn't have a problem with it. But at roughly eight o'clock PM Eastern time, Griffin finally spoke out about the images and issued an apology.
In a 31 second long video posted to Twitter, Griffin started off by saying that “I sincerely apologize. I'm just now seeing the reaction of these images. I'm a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line and then I cross it. I went way too far.”
“The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn't funny, I get it. I've made a lot of mistakes in my career. I will continue,” they added. “I asked your forgiveness. Taking down the image. Going to ask the photographer to take down the image. And I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far. I made a mistake and I was wrong."
I am sorry. I went too far. I was wrong. pic.twitter.com/LBKvqf9xFB — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) May 30, 2017
In addition to being a comedian, Griffin is also an employee of CNN. They occasionally are asked to give their opinion, but she's more known for co-hosting the network's New Year's Eve coverage with Anderson Cooper. It took CNN until after nine o'clock Eastern to finally release a statement. In a tweet by CNN's media reporter Dylan Bryer, the statement said:
We found what they did disgust and offensive. We are pleased to see they have apologized and asked that the photos be taken down. We are evaluating our New Year's Eve coverage and have made no decisions at this time.
Griffin's New Year's Eve co-host, Anderson Cooper, also took to Twitter to denounce their actions. “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate,” they wrote. Cooper did not make any reference to Griffin during their two-hour-long program.

CNN had only aired one story about the mock Trump beheading, which almost seemed forced by Jake Tapper during their show The Lead. Not only did it take CNN several hours to give a statement to the public, but they had also been ducking their own reporters. In an online report written up by CNN's Sandra Gonzalez, before CNN's official statement was released, they wrote that “Questions were also raised about whether the photos would affect Griffin's relationship with CNN … CNN has not yet responded to request for comment.”
In a time where the media likes to opine about how President Trump is dividing the country, Griffin managed to unite people around one cause: decency in political satire, if you could even call it that.

Mark Scott has signalled the ABC faces a major restructure, which they said will follow further budget cuts yet to be announced by the federal government.
As well as more outsourcing of TV production, buildings sales, automation and consolidation of websites, Scott also said ABC programming and services were not immune.
Scott said the ABC had created many specialist websites and specialist content, such as arts, which would now be shifted to the news sites to streamline digital services.
“We face the immediate future knowing that funding cuts are coming, but their size has not yet been determined,” the managing director told journalism students at the Queensland University of Technology faculty of creative industries in Brisbane on Friday morning.
Scott warned of “further dislocation” as the old analogue structure of the ABC was transformed into one suited to a digital world.
In the federal budget, the government said the withdrawal of funding for the Australia Network – which resulted in the loss of 70 jobs – was only a “down payment” on further cuts the ABC would be required to make.
Scott said the ABC – which created ABC News 24 and iView with no additional funding – was already operating with 2,000 fewer staff and $200m less in funding in real terms than 10 years ago.
“I expect when the funding position from Canberra becomes clear, significant decisions about the ABC's operations and funding priorities will follow,” they said.
“Are there activities that we can drop, automate, do differently? We are working with SBS to see if, by working more closely together, we can make back-room savings, while remaining independent editorially.
“Our ambition must be to spend as much as we can on programs, to reduce what we spend on administration and support functions. Ensuring the ABC is as efficient and effective as possible.”
In a speech clearly aimed at the government, Scott said “those who write the cheques in Canberra” should get a sense of the “unprecedented scale and pace of change that we and our colleagues in the media sector are encountering”.
“We must accept that in the fierce contest for audiences, where old alliances no longer work and where friends can become rivals, the ABC has to robustly review its programming and services, find new ways to keep the audiences we have and to attract new ones.
“We will make the investment necessary to deliver quality programming. But it will be prudent and we will need to make careful judgments about the audience return.
In a wide-ranging speech they outlined the bleak landscape in which the media was operating in 2014, with fewer media proprietors, huge job losses and “few survivors willing to sacrifice earnings to deliver a broader, less tangible asset back to the community”.
The ABC provided content the commercial media would not and could not because it didn't deliver the biggest audiences and the biggest profits: things such as children's television, narrative comedy and innovative drama. An example is Triple J, they said, without which the Australian music industry would struggle to survive.
“The ABC is not immune to the cost pressures that have squeezed the rest of the industry. Costs are rising for both acquired material and local production content. Like our rivals we battle ever-increasing insurance premiums and electricity charges,” they said.
“Now the pressure has been intensified: we must return efficiency saving to Canberra, yet at the same time, free up the funds needed for investment to meet audience needs and expectations.
Scott mounted a strong argument that despite the ABC's vociferous critics it enjoyed the support of 84% of the Australian public who believe the ABC provides a valuable or very valuable service.
Newspoll recently confirmed what every survey has found which is that audiences believe the ABC is fair and balanced and that it is overwhelmingly supported and trusted by the Australian public.
“But many of our relentless critics reveal more about their own views of the world and how they are positioning themselves in the media marketplace than they do about the ABC,” Scott said.
“They speak because of an ideological opposition to public funding of media like the ABC or because of the commercial impact they feel the ABC has on their own operations.”
The ABC is axing the program hosted by Yassmin Abdel-Magied a month after the television presenter and activist sparked outrage over their Anzac Day comments.
Australia Wide is set to be shelved in the coming weeks as part of the national broadcaster's sweeping restructure. As well as programming changes, as many as 200 jobs are being slashed in order to reinvest $50 million a year back into regional and online content.
Abdel-Magied has hosted Australia Wide since 2016. Last month, the presenter courted controversy after publishing an Anzac Day Facebook post that suggested Australians should also remember the suffering of refugees on Manus Island and Nauru.
The retribution was swift and brutal, with many accusing the part-time ABC presenter of politicising a day designed to remember those killed defending their country.
After Michelle Obama's comments about slaves building the White House, Bill O'Reilly defended their working conditions. | Getty Bill O'Reilly: Slaves who built White House were 'well-fed and had decent lodgings'
Political commentator Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday defended the working conditions for the slaves who built the White House, attempting to fact-check Michelle Obama's speech from the night before.
"Slaves that worked there were well fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government, which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802," said the host of Fox's “The Factor."
Story Continued Below
“So, Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House, but there were others working as well,” they continued.
The first lady delivered a keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night, where they supported Hillary Clinton and taking a jab at the Republican nominee.
"I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves," they said. "And I watch my daughters, two beautiful, intelligent black young women, playing with their dogs on the White House lawn.”

“And because of Hillary Clinton my daughters and all our sons and daughters now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States. So don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again, because this right now is the greatest country on earth."
O'Reilly continued their history lesson: “In addition, free blacks, whites, and immigrants also worked on the massive building. There were no illegal immigrants at that time. If you could make it here, you could stay here.”
“I just can't get rid of that history teacher thing. You know what I'm talking about?”
BALTIMORE -- A moment of agony. A day without sleep. And a night of triumph before a national audience.
Now Torrey Smith can sit back and reflect on what he's done: Their younger brother died late Saturday night upon crashing their motorcycle into a utility pole on a rural Virginia road. And somehow, some 20 hours later, Smith was in a Baltimore Ravens uniform, catching a pair of touchdown passes in a come-from-behind 31-30 victory vs. the New England Patriots.
And Smith wasn't even sure he'd suit up until they walked into the stadium at 4 p.m.
PHOTOS: Torrey Smith's emotional night
"I texted my mom when I got here," they said of their decision. "She was like, 'Of course he'd want you to play.' They admired me so much."
When the day began, the second-year wide receiver received an urgent phone call after 1 a.m. ET, rousing them from bed in the team hotel room they shared with Tandon Doss. Smith heard the news -- that Tevin Jones, 19, was dead in Westmoreland County -- and they sprinted out of the room, headed home.
"We had slept for a couple hours. They just kind of ran out the room," Doss said. "I really didn't know what happened. I asked them if they were alright and they didn't really give a response."
Smith was off to be with their mother and five remaining younger siblings, whom Smith helped raise while their mother attended community college and worked long hours. But first they told coach John Harbaugh they wanted to play at 8:20 p.m. back in Baltimore.

"If you're around athletics, you feel like it's an escape. It's an opportunity to get out there and do what they do," Harbaugh said. "He was going to get their opportunity to play, they deserved that. If it didn't work out, then we'd have known and he'd have known. Obviously, he's a pretty special guy."
If the game was a release for the 23-year-old, it didn't show on their face early Sunday night. After managing a morning nap and sleeping for only several hours over a 48-hour period, Smith was visibly shaken by the team's pregame moment of silence for their brother. They held back tears in the moments before kickoff. They said the gesture touched him.
"The way they care about you. That's the reason I wanted to be in Baltimore," they said. "That's the reason I wanted to be a Raven."
Then Smith took the field, resolved not to hurt the team. They did the opposite, leaping for a 25-yard touchdown in the second quarter. They immediately pointed to the sky, knelt for a moment in prayer, then rose and pointed upward again. They added another touchdown in the fourth quarter, catching a five-yard Joe Flacco pass while sprinting to the sideline.
Smith finished with six receptions for 127 yards as the Ravens improved to 2-1, overcoming the team which denied them a Super Bowl berth in last season's AFC title game.
"It was awesome," Flacco said. "I can't imagine what he's going through. Torrey plays like this all the time, and for them to come out and be able to play football the way they did tonight, it says a lot about just who they are."
And afterwards, Smith just wanted to talk about who Tevin was. Jones graduated in 2010 from King George High School in King George, Va., where they played football and basketball. While in college, Torrey visited King George High on several occasions to see Tevin play football or basketball. Authorities say Jones was wearing their helmet when they wrecked, and alcohol was not a factor.

"When you'd see them mad, you'd always laugh because it didn't look right," Smith said. "So, to be around him, their big smile and their laugh, which was probably one of the most annoying laughs ever, I'm definitely going to miss him."
Jones was a quarterback on coach Jeff Smith's team at King George.
"Every time I'd see them it was the same old Tevin," Jeff Smith said Sunday. "Big smile. Big jokester and a prankster. Every time you saw him, what you see was what you got."
The coach and family friend described Torrey Smith's extended family as very big and very close-knit. Torrey went to Stafford High School in Falmouth, Va., before attending the University of Maryland and eventually being selected by the Ravens in the second round of last year's draft.
 They are well-respected and liked in the Ravens locker room, and enjoyed an outpouring of support from teammates and many in the NFL community on Sunday, which they are thankful for.
"There's not a better guy on this team than Torrey Smith," said Ravens tight end Dennis Pitta. "For them to come out and play the way they did today was unbelievable. I can't even begin to put myself in their shoes. It's got to be hard, but they came in with a smile on their face and played unbelievable tonight."
It doesn't get any easier for Smith or the Ravens. They face the Cleveland Browns on Thursday for their third game in 11 days. Smith was planning on hosting Jones at their home this week to celebrate their birthday. They would've turned 20 on Saturday. Instead, Smith will cling to their remaining relatives and the team they consider an extension of that family.
"My teammates, I love them to death, and they helped me get through this," Smith said.
If New York City councilwoman Margaret Chin has their way, it may soon be illegal to own a fake Prada handbag, or any of the other counterfeits openly sold in their Chinatown district, the “ ground zero ” for New York's knockoffs. Chin's proposed $1,000 fine for counterfeit buyers is merely the latest salvo in the war against designer rip-offs waged by the FBI, industry groups, and designers themselves.
Yet a preliminary study focused on counterfeit sales in China—the source of all those fake handbags in Chinatown and just about everywhere else—suggests that in many cases the sale of fakes may not be so bad for legitimate brands. The study, by Northwestern economist Yi Qian , examined the counterfeit market in the wake of well-publicized cases of food poisoning and exploding gas tanks in China, when enforcement efforts were diverted from policing fashion copycats and toward monitoring drugs, food, and gas. Counterfeit factories flourished, but surprisingly, this led to an increase in sales for high-end products in the years that followed.
When most people think about the effect of counterfeits on legitimate brands—and when brands themselves litigate against counterfeiters—they focus on the “business stealing” effect: Every fake Prada handbag represents a lost sale for Prada. But a dirty little secret is that Prada rip-offs can also function as free advertising for real Prada handbags—partly by signaling the brand's popularity, but, less obviously, by creating what MIT marketing professor Renee Richardson Gosline has described as a “ gateway ” product. For their doctoral thesis , Gosline immersed themselves in the counterfeit “purse parties” of upper-middle-class moms. They found that their subjects formed attachments to their phony Vuittons and came to crave the real thing when, inevitably, they found the stitches falling apart on their cheap knockoffs. Within a couple of years, more than half of the women—many of whom had never fancied themselves consumers of $1,300 purses—abandoned their counterfeits for authentic items.
Measuring the net effect of counterfeiting, though, is a tricky matter. If Prada sales increase alongside counterfeit sales, is that because fakes provide valuable advertising? Or could the sales increase merely indicate higher demand for Prada products, both real and fake? It's impossible to say. The genius of Qian's approach is that they found what amounted to a random jump in counterfeiting activity that resulted from events entirely unrelated to the apparel industry. In the early 1990s, a string of quality-control problems among food, drug, and gas-tank producers in China made headlines around the world. Australian regulators documented salmonella and listeria contamination in Chinese food imports, and mercury and arsenic concentrations up to many times the legal limit. Stories of exploding Chinese fuel cans—often with fatal consequences—appeared with alarming regularity. And in 1994, the Wall Street Journal reported that “bogus medicines have flooded parts of China, causing deaths and disabilities.” With the rising body count, Chinese authorities didn't have the time or the resources to keep close tabs on what was happening in handbag or sneaker factories. The Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau, tasked with ensuring quality standards as well as counterfeit enforcement, cut the budget for footwear oversight from 160 million yuan in 1994 to just over 40 million the following year.
To document the impact of this drop in enforcement, professor Qian put together data on production costs, sales, and retail prices for 31 brands with serious business in China, including multinational giants like Nike and Reebok and local favorites like Li-ning and Anta, each with Chinese market shares comparable to Nike's. They obtained similar figures for counterfeiters from QTSB and records seized from counterfeit factories by enforcement authorities.
With policing severely curtailed, counterfeiting took off in 1995—Qian estimates a nearly 100-fold increase in the production of fakes within just two years. If the flood of rip-off sneakers were crowding out sales of legitimate brands, you'd expect to see a corresponding drop in their business. Indeed, after stripping out the effects of the generally booming Chinese economy, which was producing more of everything in the 1990s, Qian did find a steep drop in sales of branded products—but only among low-end product lines. Top-of-the-line items actually saw an uptick in sales between 1994 and 1996, even as counterfeit sales took off.
The copies of low-end items—produced with cheap fabric on cheap, locally made machinery, were scarcely different from the real deal, which were also produced with cheap fabric on cheap machinery. So it's easy to understand why consumers might opt for the lower-cost counterfeit. It's a lot harder to make vinyl look like alligator skin, or to replicate the precision of imported Italian equipment. High-end products were therefore insulated from the encroachment of cheap copycats.
Qian's findings do not suggest that Nike, Reebok, Prada, or Louis Vuitton should be any less tenacious in going after counterfeiters. According to Gosline Richardson, one reason why customers upgrade from Canal Street imitations to the genuine article is the twinge of guilt that comes along with engaging in back-alley counterfeit purchases. If there were less legal sanction against counterfeits, it might diminish those feelings of guilt among consumers.
That said, global brands might devote more of their efforts to upgrading their own products, taking a page from the playbook of footwear manufacturers challenged by Chinese counterfeiters in the 1990s. In addition to ramping up their own enforcement efforts to substitute for the work of government investigators, these manufacturers made their high-end items even more expensive, to further distance their products from imitators. They added more top-tier leather, more crocodile hides, more use of imported machinery. Most of these improvements came in the form of upgrades to surface and side materials, which would clearly distinguish authentic shoes from knockoffs. The manufacturers seem to have come to the same conclusion Qian did: For top-of-the-line products, imitation isn't merely flattery—it's also good for business.
The ties that bind: Canadian connections across a vast country are strong
For many, Ontario is the “centre of the universe”, and Quebec is a close second
September 2, 2016 – The 13 million Canadians who live outside central Canada may chuckle – or kvetch – about Ontario being the centre of the universe, but a new poll from the Angus Reid Institute suggests Canada's most populous province appears to live up to this billing, at least in terms of personal connections to the province and its people.
Asked whether they have ever visited, lived in, or had family or friends in Ontario, some eight-in-ten who don't live there report at least one of these ties to that province.
Then there's Quebec: Seven-in-ten Canadians have some personal connection to la belle province – though this is predominantly due to visitation, rather than having lived there or having friends and family in the province.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, fully three-in-four Canadians report have no personal connection to Newfoundland and Labrador.
Key Findings:
The vast majority of Canadian adults (86%) have visited at least one other province, and two per cent have been to every province and Canada's north
Eight-in-ten Canadians who live outside of Ontario (79%) have either lived there in the past, visited, or have friends or family living there. The same is true of 69 per cent of non-Quebecers' relationships to la belle province
By contrast, Canada's north is the least-connected region of the country, with only one-in-seven (14%) saying they have visited or lived there, or have friends and family living there
PART 1: Which provinces are most and least connected?
Just about everyone has a connection to Ontario
In many ways, Ontario is the social and cultural core of Canada. The province is home to the country's capital, its largest city, its news and entertainment media, and roughly 40 per cent of its population.
So it's little wonder, then, that even those Canadians who make their homes elsewhere across the Great White North are likely to have visited Ontario (61% have), or to have close friends or family living there (36% do), or to have lived there themselves at some point in their lives (19%).
Indeed, just one-in-five (21%) say they have none of these personal connections to Ontario.
Remarkably, it is residents of neighbouring Quebec – rather than provinces at either end of the country – who profess the least personal affiliation to next-door Ontario:
Likewise, if Ontario is the centre of the universe, Quebec is a very old star near the origin point. At least half of the residents of each province express some personal bond with la belle province:
These two regions – the historical Upper and Lower Canada – are responsible for much of the foundation of Canadian society, and their high levels of connectedness with the rest of the country follow logically from this position.
Canadian ties to these two key regions manifest themselves in different ways, however.
Connections to Quebec are driven by visitation, not relationships
As mentioned, almost seven-in-ten non-Quebecers express some personal affiliation with Quebec – either because they've visited (61% have), or used to live there (9%), or have friends or family there (19%).
However, while Quebec and Ontario are equally likely to be a destination for out-of-province visitors, Canadians are considerably more likely to say they have close friends or family in Ontario (36% of non-Ontarians do) than in Quebec (19% of non-Quebecers).
To compare, 35 per cent of non-British-Columbians have friends or family in B.C., and 34 per cent of non-Albertans have friends or family in Alberta. This, despite the fact that those provinces have populations considerably smaller than that of Quebec.
Perhaps this speaks to Quebec's traditional position as a distinct linguistic society within Canada. It's a place lots of surveyed Canadians from predominantly English-speaking regions say they have visited, but not a place to which they report stronger personal or familial ties.
In turn, Quebecers themselves report relatively few out-of-province friendships or family members. One-in-four (24%) have friends or family in Ontario, and the total is one-in-six or lower for every other region (see comprehensive tables for greater detail).
The road less-traveled: Provinces claiming fewer connections to Canadians
While Ontario and Quebec are 1 and 1A for Canadians, the interconnectedness of other regions of the country should not be diminished. The table that follows shows the high degree of connection between Canadians from each province – even ones on the other side of the country, in many cases.
Note: To properly interpret the table, read from top to bottom. For example, the column labeled “BC” indicates personal connections held by British Columbians with other regions of the country.
Perhaps predictably, the regions Canadians are least likely to have a personal experience with tend to be more geographically remote.
At the top of this list is the country's north (asked about as a single region for the purposes of this survey). More than eight-in-ten Canadians (86%) have never been to or lived in any of the northern territories, and have no friends or family there.
Among the provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador is least well-connected to Canadians from elsewhere. Indeed, three-quarters (76%) of non-residents say they have no personal link to it.
Prince Edward Island (63%) and the Prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba (60% each) hold the next lowest levels of connectedness.
Each of these geographically remote regions is also socially remote – at least in terms of the number of people from elsewhere in Canada who express a personal connection to it. That said, as the table presented earlier highlights, residents of neighbouring regions are more likely to have connections in these less well-known parts of the country.
Newfoundland, for example, may be poorly integrated into the lives of Canadians who live elsewhere in the country, but most residents of other Atlantic provinces profess some connection to Canada's easternmost jurisdiction.
Alberta also holds a uniquely strong relationship with the nation's largest maritime province, likely due to a history of commuting workers. Eight-in-ten Newfoundlanders/Labradorians (82%) say they have a connection to Alberta, compared to 62 per cent who have a connection to B.C. and just 37 per cent to Saskatchewan.
PART 2: Which Canadians are most well-traveled?
Regionally, it is residents of Atlantic Canada who tend to have visited a larger number of provinces than other Canadians. This is likely attributable to the relative size of the provinces in the region. It's easier to visit another province when your home is, by definition, just a few hundred kilometres from a provincial border, at most.
Outside of the Atlantic region, it is Prairie residents – those from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and, to a lesser extent, Alberta – who are most likely to have visited five or more provinces other than their own. Canadians from British Columbia, Ontario, and especially Quebec, meanwhile, are more likely to stay home:
Looking at Canadians' domestic travel experiences in greater detail, it becomes apparent that – despite the country's vastness – Canadians are a well-traveled bunch:
Note: This table should be read in the same way as the previous one. For example, the column labeled “BC” indicates the percentage of British Columbians who have visited other regions of the country.
As might be expected, those Canadians who have lived longer – and thus had more opportunity to travel their country – are more likely to have visited at least half of the nation's provinces.
Indeed, among respondents aged 65 and older, a majority (54%) have visited at least five provinces other than the one in which they currently reside. Among Canadians under age 25, meanwhile, the vast majority (86%) have visited four regions or fewer:
Income and education also correlate to greater rates of domestic travel. Canadians with lower levels of each tend to have traveled less, while those with university degrees and those with household incomes of $100,000 or more tend to score higher (see comprehensive tables).
Another group more likely to be possessed by wanderlust? Men. Four-in-ten men (41%) have visited 5 or more provinces, compared to three-in-ten women (30%). This is driven, in large part, by older men, as seen in the graph that follows:
The Angus Reid Institute (ARI) was founded in October 2014 by pollster and sociologist, Dr. Angus Reid. ARI is a national, not-for-profit, non-partisan public opinion research organization established to advance education by commissioning, conducting and disseminating to the public accessible and impartial statistical data, research and policy analysis on economics, political science, philanthropy, public administration, domestic and international affairs and other socio-economic issues of importance to Canada and its world.

Principal ores: TIN
Penwith: grid reference SW436345
Notable minerals: Chlorite, Fluor, Jasper, Chalcocite & Schorl.
There is thought to have been a mine on this site from ancient times. The present buildings date from its zenith between 1814 and 1878. The most visible parts of the Ding Dong Mine sett to be seen today, are the pumping engine houses over Tredinneck Shaft in the east and Greenburrow Shaft to the west. There are records of the company running five beam engines on its ground in 1840. By 1850 the mine employed about 100 people but the ore was beginning to be worked out in the eastern section causing production to move westwards. The workings of the former Wheal Malkin were reopened with operations centered on Greenburrow shaft.
Greenburrow pumping engine house was erected in 1865 to house a 40-inch cylinder pumping engine, that had previously been in use over North Killiow Shaft. Greenburrow lies on the high moors just to the east of the Madron-Morvah road on Burnt Downs.
Ding Dong Mine's new centre was around Greenburrow Shaft, Bolitho Shaft and the Old Wheal Boys Shaft. About half a mile to the east lay Greenpease shaft and Jacobine shaft. East of these shafts lay the start of the tramway near Croft Reeve, and the site of the Miner's Dry, a whim engine and the ore dressing floors. Over on the eastern side of the sett lay Ishmael's Whim Engine house, Hard Shaft and East Killiow Shaft. Further on, near to the hamlet of Tredinneck lay Providence Shaft and the former Count House, marking the eastern boundary of the tramway. At the end of the decade the mine had expanded its workings to be employing over 200 workers. The workforce rose to its maximum of over 250 men and boys by the 1870's, but the company was finding it more and more difficult to balance the books.
Alluvial tin discovered in Queensland, Australia in the mid 1870's led to a glut of world tin, depressing the tin price. Many Cornish mines were now not viable to keep running. The company decided to offer the mine for sale at auction in 1877. Unfortunately, the mine could not be sold and so finally shut down in May 1877. Several attempts have been made to reopen the mine since then but sadly these have all come to nothing.
There is a wealth of information on the mines and miners of Cornwall available. Why not explore Cornwall's industrial heritage through the Bookstore?

Police scientists have hailed a new technique that recently played a pivotal role in securing a murder conviction as the most significant development in audio forensics since Watergate.
The capability, called "electrical network frequency analysis" (ENF), is now attracting interest from the FBI and is considered the exciting new frontier in digital forensics, with power lines acting as silent witnesses to crime.
In the "high profile" murder trial, which took place earlier this year, ENF meant prosecutors were able to show that a seized voice recording that became vital to their case was authentic. Defence lawyers suggested it could have been concocted by a witness to incriminate the accused.
The police force that ran the investigation this week declined to name the murderer in response to requests from The Register , citing undisclosed "operational reasons".
ENF relies on frequency variations in the electricity supplied by the National Grid. Digital devices such as CCTV recorders, telephone recorders and camcorders that are plugged in to or located near the mains pick up these deviations in the power supply, which are caused by peaks and troughs in demand. Battery-powered devices are not immune to to ENF analysis, as grid frequency variations can be induced in their recordings from a distance.
At the Metropolitan Police's digital forensics lab in Penge, south London, scientists have created a database that has recorded these deviations once every one and a half seconds for the last five years. Over a short period they form a unique signature of the electrical frequency at that time, which research has shown is the same in London as it is in Glasgow.
On receipt of recordings made by the police or public, the scientists are able to detect the variations in mains electricity occuring at the time the recording was made. This signature is extracted and automatically matched against their ENF database, which indicates when it was made.
The technique can also uncover covert editing - or rule it out, as in the recent murder trial - because a spliced recording will register more than one ENF match.
The Met emphasised that ENF analysis is in its infancy as a practical tool, having been used in only around five cases to date. Proponents are optimistic about its uses in counter-terrorism investigations, for example to establish when suspects made reconnaissance videos of their targets, or to uncover editing in propaganda videos.
Dr Alan Cooper, the leader of the Met's ENF project, said the technique is proving invaluable in serious cases, where audio and video evidence and its authenticity is often questioned.
ENF analysis is founded on research originally carried out by Dr Catalin Grigoras, a Romanian audio forensics expert. The British team showed Dr Grigoras' findings in eastern Europe were applicable to the UK National Grid, and developed algorithms to automate the analysis.
"ENF has basically been made possible by the move to digital recording," Dr Cooper said.
"Old magnetic cassette and VHS tapes didn't keep time accurately enough to extract reliable data, but now we can analyse even cheap voice recorders.
"The Americans are very interested. It's fair to say this is the most significant development in the field since techniques were developed to analyse the Watergate Tapes."
The field of audio forensics was largely established as a result of the Watergate scandal. In 1973 a federal court commissioned a panel of audio engineers to investigate the infamous 18 and a half minute gap in President Nixon's Watergate Tapes, the magnetic recordings they secretly made of their White House conversations.
The probe gave rise to a range of new techniques that showed that in fact as many as nine separate sections of a vital tape had been erased. Their report went on to form the basis of audio forensics for decades.
In contrast to the months of painstaking work on the Watergate Tapes, the computer power now cheaply available means the Met's ENF lab could authenticate a month-long digital audio or video recording in 10 to 12 minutes. ®

It's been pretty much an open secret around town in Wellington but Steven Lang has been publicly confirmed as playing Shrike Lang is arguably most well known for playing Colonel Miles Quaritch in Avatar but their recent turn as Waldo in The Bad Lands has been pretty well received.Here's Lang's announcement of their role via Twitter:Given that Avatar was filmed in NZ in under Jim Cameron's eye in Peter Jackson's playground of Miramar, Lang would have been well acquainted with Jackson and company so when looking for someone who could convincingly play the 'bad guy' role of Shrike, they would have known Lang to be a good fit.We were quite pleased when earlier this month Mortal Engines author Philip Reeve confirmed that the character was called Shrike and not Grike as is used in the American publications of the Predator Cities Quartet Update: Shrike has not appeared in either the teaser or the trailer. Christian Reeves and the marketing team are clearly holding the character back for quite a big reveal.
At noon on Sunday, July 12, New York City's first ever Disability Pride parade will commence at Madison Square Park, traveling down Broadway to Union Square Park to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
The all-volunteer nonprofit group Disability Pride NYC worked with the Mayor's Office of People with Disabilities to establish the event.
Expect an “extravaganza” on the big stage featuring performances from disabled musicians, dancers, comedians and stars of TV, stage and screen. Elected officials will also be in the wings.
We were alerted to the event by Dustin Jones, advocate and board member of Disabled in Action, a civil rights organization working to end discrimination against disabled New Yorkers in multiple arenas, including education, employment, health care, housing, and public accommodations.
The founder and president of the Disability Pride movement is world renowned jazz pianist Mike LeDonne, whose daughter, Mary, was born with a very rare syndrome called Prader-Willi and another condition called hydrocephalus. In 2012 Mike started the wheels in motion to create a Disability Pride Day, an annual event like any other ethnic parade in the New York City.
People of all abilities are welcome.

A second-grader stole the show today, even as U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon held a press conference in the Rose Garden at the White House.
While the two Presidents spoke about the need for immigration reform and about concerns over Arizona's harsh new law -- without saying anything new or different -- down the road in Silver Spring, Maryland, First Lady Michele Obama and Mexico's First Lady Margarita Zavala visited an elementary school to speak with a class of second graders.
ABC News' Karen Travers reports what happened when a young girl spoke up:
The student shyly raised their hand and said, "My mom ... they say that Barack Obama is taking everybody away that doesn't have papers." Mrs. Obama replied: "Yeah, well that's something that we have to work on, right? To make sure that people can be here with the right kind of papers, right? That's exactly right." The girl then said quietly, "But my mom doesn't have any ..." and trailed off. Mrs. Obama replied: "Well, we have to work on that. We have to fix that, and everybody's got to work together in Congress to make sure that happens. That's right."
Watch the video of the exchange:
Sadly, this brief exchange says more about the current state of the immigration debate than the remarks of the two Presidents in the Rose Garden today.
The little girl wants their mother to have papers, but hears that the President is sending people away if they don't.
In fact, the Obama Administration is on track this year to exceed the deportation levels of the Bush Administration. Most of those deported are not criminals, but ordinary immigrants whose only violation was to come to this country without papers to work hard and seek better lives. With common-sense comprehensive immigration reform stalled in Congress, and Arizona taking matters into their own hands, this young girl gives voice to the growing frustration and desperation in immigrant families and communities.
Like the "DREAM Act 5" who earlier this week staged a sit-in in John McCain's office, young people are increasingly underscoring the dysfunction and consequences of our broken immigration system and showing how Washington's failure to address the unstable and unsustainable status quo is becoming a moral and political crisis.

We've all heard the maxim that “women don't ask.” This view is so prevalent that an entire cottage industry has sprung up to address it. The problem is that it's simply untrue.
Catalyst's new report, The Myth of the Ideal Worker, the latest in our series on high-potential employees, makes it clear that even when women do “all the right things” they're unlikely to earn as much or advance as far as their male colleagues.
For example, by looking at the career paths of over 4000 MBA grads from around the world, Catalyst found that women were more likely than men to ask for a variety of skill-building experiences and to proactively seek training opportunities. And we also found that women and men negotiated for a higher level position or greater compensation during the hiring process for their current job at equal rates.
Women do ask—but get little in return. Equally skilled men advance farther and more quickly than their female peers. In fact, we found that the $4600 pay gap that starts from day one grew to more than $31,000 several years down the track—even when women asked.
The problem isn't the women—it's the business environment. Entrenched sexism dominates, especially in talent management systems. Women are held to different standards than men: women must prove themselves multiple times to get ahead while men are promoted on promise. And gendered language still prevails, with words like “aggressive” or “bold” baked into job descriptions to describe ideal candidates. These are words more often associated with men—and this explains why women are viewed as an imperfect fit for many top jobs.
Until problems inherent in the system are fixed, there are some tactics that our research found especially beneficial to women's advancement. For example, women who were more proactive self-promoters were better able to advance their careers and increase their salaries, and were overall more professionally satisfied, than women who were less likely to make their achievements visible.
In other words, women who toot their own horn do get ahead—and are happier at work too.
Women can make their achievements more visible by telling managers about their accomplishments, seeking credit for a job well done, requesting additional performance feedback, and perhaps most importantly, asking for a promotion when deserved.
Doing so will help attract a sponsor—an important key to advancement. Unlike mentors, sponsors advocate for you from behind closed doors and help you climb the ladder. But to attract a sponsor, women need to be visible. And companies need to do their part too—the onus is on them to identify and develop rising talent.
Smart companies hold executives accountable for the success of female rising stars. Organizations that neglect talent management issues are at risk of lagging their competitors in attracting, developing, and retaining the best candidates to serve as their next generation of leaders. And business leaders would be well served by dumping myths that propagate stereotypes and unintentionally hold women back.
The issue isn't that women don't ask. Maybe it's that men don't have to.
Ilene H. Lang is the president and CEO of Catalyst, the leading non-profit engaged in building inclusive workplaces and advancing women and business. I spend a chunk of my time reading, writing and speaking on the topic of women in business leadership. Nearly every day I come across interesting articles, reports, books, surveys and investigations into this topic. So what better way to share my discoveries, thoughts and ideas than with a blog?
Lehtera, who was traded from the Blues to the Flyers on June 23, has been skating and working out at their former team's practice facility with eagerness for the upcoming season, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports.
The Finn spent their first three seasons in St. Louis, having surged out of the gate with a rookie year that included 14 goals, 30 assists and a plus-21 rating. However, their production slipped quite a bit in the two subsequent years -- all the way down to 22 points and a minus-6 rating over 64 contests in 2016-17. Perhaps a change of scenery will invigorate Lehtera, but don't be surprised if it takes them awhile to settle in. After all, he's projected to start out in a bottom-six role for a Flyers offense that was inferior to the Blues during their tenure with the Notes.
Mike Johnston has compiled the best winning percentage of any Penguins coach at the midway point of their first season:
Imagine this job description.
Replace a guy who won the franchise's most recent Stanley Cup. Do it, too, as a first-time NHL head coach. Earn respect from, and get the best out of, four world-class players. Deal with injuries to 14 players and a mumps outbreak.
Yet here we are. Penguins coach Mike Johnston is a man of many medical updates. And wins. Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Kris Letang and Marc-Andre Fleury are thriving. The Penguins are among the Eastern Conference's elite teams.
Some are surprised. General manager Jim Rutherford is not.
“What they have done confirms who I thought they are,” Rutherford said. “Well organized. Very good communicator. Able to make adjustments as time goes on.”
Saturday's game marked the halfway point of the regular season, and any early evaluation of Johnston would figure to be largely positive.
“He's been really consistent in their message,” Crosby said. “As players, that's one thing you look for. With so many injuries, sometimes things can change pretty quickly. He's been constant in what they stress.”
Constant, yes. Conventional? No.
For example, Johnston long has admired former Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson for their Zen-like demeanor. Jackson has written several books on their philosophies; Johnston has read every one.
Johnston is reading “Mindfulness for Beginners” by Jon Kabat-Zinn. It's about staying in the moment — enjoying it and succeeding in it while not allowing yourself to become affected by outside sources.
“It trains your mind to really focus on things that are important and releases all the other (stuff) that's out there,” Johnston said in a recent interview from their office at Consol Energy Center.
But Johnston likes other things. Believes wholeheartedly in them, too. Like dinners with their wife. Or phoning a friend and avoiding hockey talk. Or exercising, specifically running.
The first half of the Penguins season has been anything but dull. Much like the team's professorial coach.
Perception vs. reality
NHL Network analyst Craig Button has a theory about why it took until age 57 for Johnston to get their first NHL head-coaching job.
“The whole idea that Mike is soft-spoken, that they don't scream, yell and carry on, it somehow gets perceived as not being able to put demands on players and really get in there and coach the team,” Button said. “I personally believe that's wrong. Those perceptions are out there, and that's probably a big reason they didn't get a head-coaching job in the NHL prior to this year.
“That said, I think Mike is an excellent coach. I think that they allow their players to do the things that they do best.”
Defenseman Rob Scuderi would agree, although maybe not on the soft-spoken thing.
“He's more intense than you would think,” Scuderi said. “You see them in a press conference or talking in general, they seem very low-key, very easygoing. But when we've needed it, he's definitely picked up their intensity. As a player, you appreciate that.”
Although they came to Pittsburgh with a reputation as an offensive guy, Johnston has done something few others have been able to do: They have the Penguins playing defense.
They're allowing 2.39 goals per game, their best mark since allowing 2.29 per game in 1997-98.
“Guys are buying into their system,” said defenseman Derrick Pouliot, who played junior hockey for Johnston's Portland Winterhawks. “He really got us to do what we needed to do in Portland. Seems like he's doing a pretty good job of that up here.”
A final determination of the job Johnston has done won't be made until the playoffs, Button said. Especially in Pittsburgh, where playoff foibles have been a touchy subject lately.
“People will say, ‘He's got a good team. They've been good in the regular season. Anybody can do that. Let's see what you can do in the playoffs,' ” Button said.
Keep your energy
In the late 1990s in Kelowna, British Columbia, Johnston ran their first and only marathon. They never had run regularly. Hated it, actually.
But they thought a marathon might make for a good challenge, and they quickly became addicted.
“I found when I got into running, I could think about a lot of things,” Johnston said. “I get a lot of work done when I run.”
Every other day, Johnston likes to work out for 45 minutes to an hour — typically running, yoga or weights. It's not only relaxing but it also allows them to focus.
They think about the power play. Or getting more from a star player. Maybe a new breakout the Penguins can use.
“I get into a rhythm where I can be really creative,” Johnston said. “I don't think I'm an overly creative person, but when I'm working out, I am.”
Johnston routinely tries new practice drills. Like on New Year's Day, when they held a two-puck scrimmage with players using their off-hand to keep things light.
The results have been hard to miss.
Malkin especially appears to be engaged, the most he's been in years. Along with Crosby, they're entrenched in the NHL's top 10 for scoring. Letang and Fleury are on pace for career-best totals in goals, points and wins, respectively.
Communication has been key, several players insisted. Also, Johnston isn't afraid to try new things — such as tinkering with the power play to get it going — but they never makes anything too complex.
“He's so prepared for everything,” center Brandon Sutter added. “He's a very easy talker, and they get the point across.”
“He's very knowledgeable,” defenseman Paul Martin said. “But for us, they simplify what they want and expects. That makes it easy.”
Place in Pittsburgh
Johnston came to Pittsburgh with the reputation as a bit of a foodie — and has lived up to it.
One of their favorite escapes remains trying new restaurants with their wife, Myrna.
They've developed a weekly routine of Sunday brunch at Meat & Potatoes on Penn Avenue. They like the atmosphere, complete with a DJ, and they call it “funky.”
Butcher and the Rye have caught their eye, as has Eleven.
“There are some really good restaurants in this area,” Johnston said.
On the day of this interview, Johnston, on the recommendation of Penguins co-owner Mario Lemieux and assistant coach Rick Tocchet, was excited to be making their first visit to Alla Famiglia.
He's eager to try Tako, a coming-soon, Mexican-Asian blend owned by the same group as Meat & Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye.
Morton's and Ruth's Chris are two of their standards for steak — one of their favorite things to order — but they still are searching for a good sushi place.
He's been to “a couple” of Steelers games. An authentic, Ben Roethlisberger-signed Steelers helmet sits on the shelf behind their desk. He's hoping, as time allows, to get more into local theatre.
“We've started to meet some people, attend some functions, do some things like that, which is a nice break from the game,” Johnston said. “Because you need it. It can overwhelm you.”
Tunnel vision
Something overwhelmingly negative about Johnston could appear in this space, and he'd never notice.
“I never read the stories. Never watch,” Johnston said. “If my wife turns on the TV and there are 3 seconds on the Penguins, I shut it off. I don't want to hear anything.
“Some days you're going to write that I'm an idiot. Some days you're going to write that I'm a genius. I don't want to know either.”
That's not to say they aren't helpful. Johnston is sometimes strikingly detailed in their answers, something that makes them a rarity among professional sports coaches.
“You don't want to feed the other team,” Johnston said. “But I want to answer the questions as honestly as I can and be as educational as I can in my answers so that you can say, ‘That makes sense. I see what he's doing.' ”
Johnston doesn't notice certain things during games, either. In Portland, fans would sing along with AC/DC's “T.N.T” when the Winterhawks scored.
Johnston knows this only because their wife told them three years into their tenure.
“I see the ice, and I see nothing else,” Johnston said. “I don't see the fans. I don't see the stands. I don't notice anything.
“I'm sure Mike Tomlin would agree. You seal it off and see everything within that.”
“That has always intrigued me,” Johnston said, again talking about Jackson as a model, “how they could maintain their focus, their calm and their philosophy on dealing with people and the team.”
That, in a way, is the essence of Johnston's mindfulness: staying in the moment.

The popularity of “Star Trek” — in all its TV iterations — makes it challenging to air the classic series with a new wrinkle.
But, starting Sunday, digital network Heroes & Icons will give viewers the chance to watch the entire original “Star Trek” series (79 episodes) — and its four spinoffs — unedited and uncut.
The original “Star Trek” aired on NBC from 1966 to 1969 with stars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley.
“At the time that the original ‘Star Trek' was produced, network shows ran much longer than they run now, and longer than what syndication allowed when the shows reran on local stations,” says Neal Sabin, vice chairperson of Weigel Broadcasting, which owns Heroes & Icons.
Translation: Scenes from the original “Star Trek” episodes were cut or trimmed down when the show began its afterlife in reruns.
“I can't definitely say that these episodes haven't run uncut since they aired on NBC, but most people haven't seen them [uncut] unless they own the series on DVD,” says Sabin. “These are good shows and we hope to bring some new people to the ‘Star Trek' franchise.”
Also airing uncut and in their original entirety — as part of the network's “All Star Trek” programming slate — will be “Star Trek: The Next Generation,” “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine,” “Star Trek: Voyager” and “Star Trek: Enterprise.”
Here's how it will work: The first episodes of each of the five “Star Trek” series will air consecutively this Sunday from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. to get the ball rolling.
Then, starting Monday (through Friday), episodes from the original “Star Trek” will air nightly at 6 p.m., followed by episodes of “The Next Generation” (7 p.m.), “Deep Space Nine” (11 p.m.), “Voyager” (midnight) and “Enterprise” (1 a.m.).
No episodes will air Saturdays; the “Star Trek” cycle begins again each Sunday (8 p.m. to 1 a.m.). “We plan on leaving the shows on for a couple of years,” says Sabin. “‘Star Trek' is the centerpiece of our programming.”
The timing isn't a coincidence; the original “Star Trek” series is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and “Star Trek Beyond,” the franchise's next big-screen movie, hits theaters on Friday.
“We want to get a jump on the ‘Star Trek' bandwagon. The new movie comes out this weekend, so why wait?” says Sabin. “The ‘Star Trek' fan base is very strong.”
Sabin says that the reaction to “Star Trek” on MeTV, another of Weigel's digital networks, is notable. “MeTV's sci-fi block on Saturday nights, which includes ‘Star Trek,' gets tremendous action on Twitter,” they say. “The Twittersphere goes crazy.”
Heroes & Icons airs on Comcast (Ch. 263), Cablevision (Ch. 140), Ch. 9.4 (WWOR's digital over-the-air channel), DISH (Ch. 42) and DirecTV (Ch. 43).
NEW YORK — A powerful video interview exclusive to Breitbart News in which Juanita Broaddrick recounted what they described as the life-changing experience of being raped by Bill Clinton has garnered over one million views on YouTube.
As of this writing, the emotional video, released two days ago, received 1,158,546 views and counting.
In the video, Broaddrick, speaking to this reporter, repeatedly broke down in tears reliving the alleged rape scene.
Watch the video here:
Trembling, Broaddrick explained that they are still afraid of Bill Clinton and asserted that they are frightened by the prospect of Hillary Clinton winning the election. They described the alleged rape in vivid detail, providing the most extensive window yet into the singular event that they say left them traumatized until today.
In one dramatic scene, a sobbing Broaddrick was embraced and consoled by another alleged Clinton sexual assault victim, Kathleen Willey, who was present for the filming.
Willey tells the crying Broaddrick: “It's not your fault. Okay. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. You didn't do anything wrong. Okay. Okay?”
Broaddrick and Willey were in our nation's capital last week to discuss how their lives were devastated by their respective experiences with the Clintons. They also emphatically warned about what a Hillary Clinton presidency could mean for women in general—and the Clintons' perceived enemies in particular.
The news-making interview was filmed in the presidential suite of the Watergate Hotel. The recording is Broaddrick's most revealing interview to date about the specifics of the alleged rapes.
Here is a partial transcript of the exchange:
BROADDRICK: And then as they point over my shoulder, they grab me and turns me to him. And that was a shock. And I tried to push them away. And I only weighed about 120 pounds at that time. They were a very large man. And I kept telling him, “No. I don't want this at all.” … And they grabbed me again, very forcefully. And started biting on my top lip. And this was extremely painful. I thought they were going to bite my lip off. And that's when they pushed me back onto the bed. KLEIN: They bit you at the top of your lip. They pushed you onto the bed. And then what happened? BROADDRICK: It's been so long and it is just so hard to go into. I need to stop. (crying) BROADDRICK: You, know, why? Why is it still so painful? (crying) KLEIN: What is going through your mind right now? BROADDRICK: That I am afraid of him. KLEIN: You are still afraid of him? BROADDRICK: Yes. That I am still afraid. Especially if they become president. And I know it's looking that way. So it's frightening, Aaron. It's frightening. … I was completely dressed. I had a skirt and a blouse. They tore the waist of my skirt. And then they ripped my pantyhose. And they raped me. It was very vicious. I was just pinned down… I did not know what to do. I was so frightened. I was only 35 at the time. And it was horrible. I just wanted it to be over with. So they would go away. KLEIN: They got up? BROADDRICK: No, they held me down for a long time. And then they did it again. I was so ready for them to leave me alone. When they started raping me again. And it was very brief… And they did get up and they straightened himself. And my mouth was bleeding and it was hurting. And they just straightens themselves and goes to the door. KLEIN: With you still on the bed? BROADDRICK: Yes, crying. They straighten themselves and they go to the door. And puts on their sunglasses. And tells me to get some ice on that on my list. And goes out the door. … They would push down on my left clavicle and it hurt so much I thought my clavicle was gonna break. And my lip was just ballooning out four times the size that it should have been. KLEIN: While they were raping you? BROADDRICK: Yes.

No place except a presidential campaign, that being the 2004 attempt to destroy the honorable Vietnam service of candidate John Kerry. Where was Bush's “respect and admiration” when their brother was benefiting from a multimillion-dollar smear of a Navy veteran with a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart?
The wise men predicted Trump's demise after they demeaned a former prisoner of war. But polls posted late this week showed Trump still in the lead. How can they get away with bashing combat veterans? Simple: The party they now want to represent wrote the playbook on it.
The racism toward Mexicans that Trump has stirred up has been swooshing around the basement of the Republican Party for some time. Representative Steve King of Iowa did Trump one better in 2013 when they said undocumented immigrants had “calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.”
Did this make King a pariah? Not judging by the number of presidential candidates who showed up at their Iowa Freedom Summit in January, there to curry their favor. Among them was Rick Perry, the former Texas governor. This week Perry called Trumpism “a toxic mix of demagogy, meanspiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if followed.”
Using the X-ray vision of their new glasses, Perry has correctly diagnosed the problem, and forecast the outcome. But that toxic mix has been just the tonic for their party for years, including Perry's suggestion that Texas might have to secede. President Obama was barely into their first months in office when Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted “You lie!” at them in a joint session of Congress. For hurling that insult, Wilson was widely praised in conservative media circles.
Trump also stoked the humiliating lie about President Obama's citizenship. They began that crusade, they claimed, because so many Republicans still believe it, and have encouraged them to keep it alive.
Now, the only way to trump Trump is to act like a fool in public. So Senator Rand Paul, formerly seen raising good questions about national issues, fired up a chain saw and took it to the tax code a few days ago — a pathetic stunt. And there was Senator Lindsey Graham, flummoxed by Trump's exposing them as sycophant to a plutocrat, destroying their cellphone in a blender. It only made us long for the real thing: Dan Aykroyd's Bass-O-Matic.
All of this overshadowed the entry into the race of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a sensible conservative who could beat Hillary Clinton. But they won't get any traction until Republicans destroy Donald Trump and the vulgar, nativist element in their party that they nurtured — until it became a monster.

A drying oil is an oil that hardens to a tough, solid film after a period of exposure to air. The oil hardens through a chemical reaction in which the components crosslink (and hence, polymerize) by the action of oxygen (not through the evaporation of water or other solvents). Drying oils are a key component of oil paint and some varnishes. Some commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, tung oil, poppy seed oil, perilla oil, and walnut oil. Their use has declined over the past several decades, as they have been replaced by alkyd resins and other binders.
Since oxidation is the key to curing in these oils, those that are susceptible to chemical drying are often unsuitable for cooking, and are also highly susceptible to becoming rancid through autoxidation, the process by which fatty foods develop off-flavors.[1] Rags, cloth, and paper saturated with drying oils may combust spontaneously (ignite) after a few hours as heat is released during the oxidation process.
Chemistry of the drying process [ edit ]
The "drying", hardening, or, more properly, curing of oils is the result of autoxidation, the addition of oxygen to an organic compound and the subsequent crosslinking. This process begins with an oxygen molecule (O 2 ) in the air inserting into carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds adjacent to one of the double bonds within the unsaturated fatty acid. The resulting hydroperoxides are susceptible to crosslinking reactions. Bonds form between neighboring fatty acid chains, resulting in a polymer network, often visible by formation of a skin-like film on samples. This polymerization results in stable films that, while somewhat elastic, do not flow or deform readily. Diene-containing fatty acid derivatives, such as those derived from linoleic acid, are especially prone to this reaction because they generate pentadienyl radicals. Monounsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, are slower to undergo drying because the allylic radical intermediates are less stable (i.e., slower to form).[2]
Simplified chemical reactions associated with cobalt-catalyzed drying process. In the first step, the diene undergoes autoxidation to give a hydroperoxide . In the second step, the hydroperoxide combines with another unsaturated side chain to generate a crosslink.
The early stages of the drying process can be monitored by weight changes in an oil film. The film becomes heavier as it absorbs oxygen. Linseed oil, for instance, increases in weight by 17 percent.[3] As oxygen uptake ceases, the weight of the film declines as volatile compounds evaporate. As the oil ages, further transitions occur. A large number of the original ester bonds in the oil molecules undergo hydrolysis, releasing individual fatty acids. In the case of paints, some portion of these free fatty acids (FFAs) react with metals in the pigment, producing metal carboxylates. Together, the various non-cross-linking substances associated with the polymer network constitute the mobile phases. Unlike the molecules that are part of the network itself, they are capable of moving and diffusing within the film, and can be removed using heat or a solvent. The mobile phase may play a role in plasticizing paint films, preventing them from becoming too brittle. Carboxyl groups in the polymers of the stationary phase ionize, becoming negatively charged and form complexes with metal cations present in the pigment. The original network, with its nonpolar, covalent bonds, is replaced by an ionomeric structure, held together by ionic interactions. The structure of these ionomeric networks is not well understood.
Most drying oils rapidly increase in viscosity after heating in the absence of air. If the oil is subjected to raised temperatures for a long time, it will become a rubbery oil-insoluble substance.[3]
Role of metal catalysts [ edit ]
The drying process is accelerated by certain metal salts, especially derivatives of cobalt, manganese, or iron. In technical terms, these oil drying agents are coordination complexes that function as homogeneous catalysts. These salts are derived from the carboxylates of lipophilic carboxylic acids, such as naphthenic acids to make the complexes oil-soluble. These catalysts speed up the reduction of the hydroperoxide intermediates. A series of addition reactions ensues. Each step produces additional free radicals, which then engage in further crosslinking. The process finally terminates when pairs of free radicals combine. The polymerization occurs over a period of days to years and renders the film dry to the touch. Premature action of the drying agents causes skinning of the paint, this undesirable process is suppressed by the addition of antiskinning agents such as methylethyl ketone oxime, which evaporate when the paint/oil is applied to a surface.
Constitution [ edit ]
Representative triglyceride found in a drying oil. The triester is derived from three different unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic (top), alpha-linolenic (middle), and oleic acids (bottom). The order of drying rate is alpha-linolenic > linoleic > oleic acid, reflecting their degree of unsaturation.
Drying oils consist of glycerol triesters of fatty acids. These esters are characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially alpha-linolenic acid. One common measure of the "siccative" (drying) property of oils is iodine number, which is an indicator of the number of double bonds in the oil. Oils with an iodine number greater than 130 are considered drying, those with an iodine number of 115–130 are semi-drying, and those with an iodine number of less than 115 are non-drying.
Comparison to waxes and resins [ edit ]
Non-"drying" waxes, such as hard-film carnauba or paste wax, and resins, such as dammar, copal, and shellac, consist of long, spaghetti-like strands of hydrocarbon molecules, which interlace and compact but do not form covalent bonds in the manner of drying oils. Thus, waxes and resins are re-dissoluble whereas a cured oil varnish or paint is not.
Safety [ edit ]
Rags, cloth, and paper saturated with drying oils may combust spontaneously (ignite) due to heat released during the curing process. This hazard is greater when oil-soaked materials are folded, bunched, or piled together, which allows heat to accumulate and accelerate the reaction. Precautions include: wetting rags with water and spreading them away from direct sunlight; closing them off completely in water inside air-tight metal containers designed for such applications; or storing them immersed in solvents in suitable closed containers. Linseed oil soaked rags were the cause of the big fire in the One Meridian Plaza 38-storey office building resulted in severe structural damage after which a decision was made to demolish the building.
Although spontaneous combustion has been said to occur with rags soaked in paint thinners, this is not true unless a drying oil is used as a thinner. However, classical paint thinners do not include drying oils. The danger is due to rags soaked in oil based paints, as it is due to the drying oils in the paints (or varnishes), not thinners per se unless they have been mixed with drying oils such as linseed.

What about the Feds? The OMCA brings a new approach to the federal problem. In order to fully understand its significance, once must know how Gonzalez v. Raich changed the game. Most by now know about Angel Raich and how the DEA raided their place and took their plants. Ms. Raich eventually challenged this action and found their way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite testimony from Angel Raich's doctor that Ms. Raich would die without use of their medical marijuana and regardless of the fact that Ms. Raich grew their own marijuana in their own house, never to sell to others or cross state lines, the Supreme Court held that Congress could use the Commerce Clause to regulate marijuana and thus the DEA raid was proper. Prior to Raich, the Court had not yet ruled on this question. This ruling opened the door for the continuous raids that we see to this day.

Several people have recently asked me if they should get their DNA sequenced. “Have you had yours tested?” they ask.
As a doctor who studies how patients make decisions about genetic testing, the question is not surprising. I have wondered about it myself.
Twelve years ago, for the first time, scientists sequenced a person's genome. The cost was about $1 billion. Since then, the price has plummeted, and is now around $5,000. Soon, it will be less than $1,000, making this question ever more common. Whole genome sequencing is giving us millions of times more genetic information about ourselves than did prior tests; and many patients are getting sequenced
The personalized or precision medicine initiative that President Obama announced in their recent State of the Union address will doubtlessly aid millions of Americans, and will involve whole genome sequencing, raising these issues further.
As the cost has fallen, more people are getting their genes sequenced. Countless patients with cancer are now having their whole genomes mapped, since genes often predict how well these individuals respond to various chemotherapies – which drugs will work best for you versus me, and which will give each of us the worst side effects. Parents who have children born with medical problems frequently seek whether a mutation is the culprit – so that they can screen for it, and prevent a subsequent child from having it. For patients confronting a particular disorder, the price of sequencing the entire genome is now getting close to that of testing for only a single gene – say, for breast cancer.
Doctors now test infants, too, for numerous diseases to aid treatment. In the future, more – perhaps most of us – will have such sequencing done, and your doctor may one day have your complete DNA on a computer in front of you.
Scientists have found scores of mutations that predict screened disease fairly well – from breast cancer to Huntington's disease to rare kinds of sudden death. Many of these mutations are “actionable,” leading to treatments and prevention.
Many people are also seeking genetic testing on their own – or are considering it – through direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies. For several years, many people got tested through companies like 23andme, which only examined a tiny fraction of a person's whole genome – at first, one one-millionth of your DNA – examining only tiny fragments called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced “snips”). Over time, such companies began looking at more SNPs, but still only around one out of every 100,000 points of information. Nonetheless, such companies claimed to offer medically useful information in addition to information about one's ancestry. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration banned 23andme from making claims about medical benefits since the company couldn't show that these claims were true. Yet while information obtained with SNPs was relatively limited, whole gene sequencing provides hundreds of thousands of times more information.
The four molecules that comprise our DNA – adenine, cystosine, thymine and guanine, abbreviated by the letters A, C, T, G — form individual combinations of 3 billion of these “letters” that are the utterly unique blueprint for making each of us. Still, we are 99.9 percent the same (as well as 98 percent similar to chimpanzees, 80 percent similar to cows and 60 percent similar to chickens).
To get a sense of these proportions, a wall of books would contain about 1,000 volumes, totaling around 3 billion letters. If these letters were DNA, we share the information in 999 of those books. One of those books out of the 1,000 contains approximately the number of letters by which we all differ, giving us our individual eye color, hair color, nose-shape and propensity to develop certain diseases.
A test that samples only one million SNPs looks at about one out of every 3,000 letters, or approximately one letter per page. Yet reading only one letter per page of a book – or a genome — gives very limited information.
Now, however, with whole genome sequencing, numerous patients are having their entire genomes – all 1,000 volumes read. Companies are now starting to sell these tests directly to consumers. This vast amount of information contains great promise, as well as needs for care.
Most predictive, actionable mutations are rare – only a small proportion of people have them. In part, evolution acts against lethal mutations – individuals who have them would survive less well than those people who lacked them. Hence, for most people with common diseases, genetic testing doesn't yet help much. Nonetheless, even if actionable mutations affect only 2 percent to 3 percent of people, that number includes more than 10 million people in the United States.
You may find genetic markers associated with various diseases that you are not looking for or anticipating. Some of these genes will be very predictive of a disease that is treatable such as breast cancer. But while scientists used to think they would find one gene that gives us a disease — a cancer gene, for example, or a “fat” gene — we are discovering that most common illnesses result from complex mixes of multiple genes and various environmental factors. So, you may learn that you have a gene that triples your risk of developing a particular disease – from 10 percent to 30 percent, for example — yet the odds are thus still 70 percent that you won't get it. And the disease may not be treatable – as with Alzheimer's. Education of patients is critical to help them grasp these complexities.
Many patients are also concerned about discrimination. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA, covers most health insurance. But it does not currently address life, disability or long-term care insurance, and for these three kinds of coverage, companies can reject customers with mutations or charge them much more. I suspect that laws will be developed to offer more protection to consumers.
Of course, the decisions may not be entirely up to you. Doctors are beginning to offer these tests to patients – whether as strong recommendations or merely as possibilities to consider. Numerous research studies of a particular disease are performing whole genome sequencing, seeking causes and treatments. Many of us will undoubtedly be included, or helped.
When people ask me if they should test, I answer, “Why are you thinking of having it done?” Some people, particularly those interested in science, think it would be “cool” to know. Others think, “Knowledge is power,” or they are the worried well. If you are seriously considering it, talk to your doctor about it. Clinical geneticists and genetic counselors can address more detailed issues that your physician may be unfamiliar with, or not know as much about.
I am curious about what lies buried in my DNA – how the blueprint that made me contains the imprints of all my ancestors. Luckily, however, I am healthy and have no major medical problems. So I see no medical reason for me to test. Of course, that may change.
Nonetheless, as doctors and patients, we have all entered a brave new world – and should proceed with prudence.
So I haven't tested…at least not yet.

Melbourne court rules random police checks 'not lawful'
Updated
A court ruling has cast doubt on police powers to randomly pull over motorists.
Two African men were stopped by police in Ascot Vale last year.
One man was charged with assault when the situation escalated
A magistrate has now ruled the Road Safety Act does not give police the unfettered power to stop motorists without suspicion.
Magistrate Duncan Reynolds ruled "there is no common law power vested in police giving them the unfettered right to stop or detain a person and seek identification details.
"Nor, is s.59 of the (Road Safety) Act a statutory source of such power."
The lawyer representing one of the men, who is fighting assault allegations, Tamar Hopkins, says the decision will have ramifications.
"At present, we understand they're (police) told to go out and stop as many cars as they can," they said.
"This ruling says you can't do that. You must stop cars when there is in fact a reason.
"Random stops are in fact not lawful."
They say it is an important ruling.
"One of the problems with arbitrary stops is that they can be used by police to stop people on the basis of discriminatory grounds rather than after they have formed a reasonable basis to believe that the driver may have committed an offence," they said.
"Many people from African backgrounds, for example, have reported that they have been subject to routine intercepts by police where there is no underlying basis for the stop."
Stops for the purpose of random breath testing are not impacted by the court ruling.
"There is a specific statutory power for police to conduct stops for this purpose," Ms Hopkins said.
Victoria Police are considering their options, including whether to appeal against the ruling at the Supreme Court.

Earlier tonight, the Royals added a potential DH candidate when they acquired defensively-challenged slugger Peter O'Brien from the Diamondbacks, and USA Today's Bob Nightengale reports that they also have had some “preliminary” talks with the Cardinals about first baseman Matt Adams (Twitter link).
[Related: Kansas City Royals Depth Chart | St. Louis Cardinals Depth Chart]
The 28-year-old Adams has long seemed like a potential trade candidate. The Cardinals told Matt Carpenter back in November that they were going to open the season as the everyday first baseman, and Adams has never lined up anywhere else on the diamond in either the Majors or the minors. Because both Carpenter and Adams swing from the left side of the dish, there's no potential for any kind of platoon scenario, and with a 6'3″, 260-pound listing, Adams isn't likely to find much success in an already-full Cardinals' outfield.
In Kansas City, though, Adams would be able to find much more consistent at-bats, presumably as a designated hitter. Currently, the Royals figure to give Jorge Soler plenty of looks there and also rotate players like Mike Moustakas and Cheslor Cuthbert into the mix from time to time. That outlook could change if the Royals deal an outfielder, thereby pushing Soler into the field with more regularity. (Jarrod Dyson has been an oft-rumored trade candidate this winter.) The Royals are actually trying to pare down the payroll a bit, but Adams is projected by MLBTR contributor Matt Swartz to earn an affordable $2.8MM salary in 2017, so the Royals could find a way to squeeze them into the payroll (especially if any additional veterans are moved following last month's trade of Wade Davis). As a bonus, Adams is controllable through 2018 via the arbitration process.
Adams has long been a force against right-handed pitching when he's been healthy enough to take the field, amassing a lifetime .284/.331/.480 battling line when holding the platoon advantage. However, durability hasn't been a strong point for Adams, who had brief DL stints for oblique and calf injuries in 2013 and 2014, respectively, before missing about half of the 2015 campaign with a torn right quadriceps muscle. They also missed about three weeks this past season due to inflammation in their left shoulder. Adams' playing time has also been suppressed by dreadful performance against left-handed pitching; St. Louis has limited them to 280 career PAs against lefties, and the resulting .212/.243/.352 batting line and 29.3 percent strikeout rate aren't encouraging.
The other question to address when considering an Adams trade is that the market is currently rife with sluggers bearing similar skill sets. Brandon Moss, Pedro Alvarez, Adam Lind, Logan Morrison, Justin Morneau and Ryan Howard are all free agents, as are left-handed-hitting outfielders like Michael Saunders and Colby Rasmus. While most of those players figure to sign for more than Adams' projected salary, it's doubtful that many of the bunch will earn significantly more. And, those free agents would obviously be available to the Royals without requiring the team to surrender any minor league talent. If the Royals are simply looking for DH candidates with power that can be had on one-year deals, then a right-handed bat like Chris Carter, Mark Reynolds or even old friend Billy Butler are free-agent options as well.
Put another way, it seems unlikely that the Royals or any other team would have a strong sense of urgency to swing a deal for Adams unless the cost of acquisition was truly palatable. That's not intended to be a knock on Adams, but the supply of this type of player greatly outweighs the demand in the current market.
Before the introduction of the tri-service designation system, the F-4 Phantom II was designated F4H by the U.S. Navy, and F-110 Spectre by the U.S. Air Force
The Tri-Service aircraft designation system is a unified system introduced in 1962 by the United States Department of Defense for designating all U.S. military aircraft. Prior to then, the U.S. armed services used separate nomenclature systems.
Under the tri-service designation system, officially introduced on 18 September 1962, almost all aircraft receive a unified designation, whether they are operated by the United States Air Force (USAF), United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC), United States Army, or United States Coast Guard (USCG). Experimental aircraft operated by manufacturers or by NASA are also often assigned designations from the X-series of the tri-service system.[1]
The 1962 system was based on the one used by the USAF between 1948 and 1962, which was in turn based on the Type, Model, Series USAAS/USAAC/USAAF system used from 1924 to 1948. The 1962 system has been modified and updated since introduction.[2]
Designation system [ edit ]
The designation system produces a Mission-Design-Series (MDS) designation of the form:
(Status Prefix)(Modified Mission)(Basic Mission)(Vehicle Type)-(Design Number)(Series Letter)
Of these components, only the Basic Mission, Design Number and Series Letter are mandatory. In the case of special vehicles a Vehicle Type symbol must also be included. The U.S. Air Force characterizes this designation system as "MDS", while the Navy, and Marine Corps refer to it as Type/Model/Series (T/M/S).[3]
Status prefix [ edit ]
These optional prefixes are attached to aircraft not conducting normal operations, such as research, testing and development. The prefixes are:
G: Permanently grounded
J: Special test, temporary
N: Special test, permanent
X: Experimental
Y: Prototype
Z: Planning
A temporary special test means the aircraft is intended to return to normal service after the tests are completed, while permanent special test aircraft are not. The Planning code is no longer used but was meant to designate aircraft "on the drawing board". For example, using this system an airframe such as the F-13 could have initially been designated as ZF-13 during the design phase, possibly XF-13 if experimental testing was required before building a prototype, the YF-13; the final production model would simply be designated F-13 (with the first production variant being the F-13A). Continuing the example, some F-13s during their service life may have been used for testing modifications or researching new designs and designated JF-13 or NF-13; finally after many years of service, the airframe would be permanently grounded due to safety or economic reasons as GF-13.
Modified mission [ edit ]
Aircraft which are modified after manufacture or even built for a different mission to the standard airframe of a particular design are assigned a modified mission code. They are:
The multi-mission and utility missions could be considered the same thing, however they are applied to multipurpose aircraft conducting certain categories of mission. M-aircraft conduct combat or special operations while U-aircraft conduct combat support missions, such as transport (e.g., UH-60) and electronic warfare (e.g., MC-12). The vast majority of U.S. Coast Guard air assets include the H-code (e.g., HH-60 Jayhawk or HC-130 Hercules).
Basic mission [ edit ]
All aircraft are to be assigned a basic mission code. In some cases, the basic mission code is replaced by one of the modified mission codes when it is more suitable (e.g., M in MH-53J Pave Low III). The defined codes are:
The rise of the multirole fighter in the decades since the system was introduced has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft. According to the current designation system, an attack aircraft (A) is designed primarily for air-to-surface missions (also known as "attack missions"),[4] while a fighter category F incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air warfare, but also multipurpose aircraft[5] designed also for attack missions. The Air Force has even assigned the F designation to attack-only aircraft,[6] such as the F-111 Aardvark and F-117 Nighthawk.
The only designated aircraft currently in the U.S. Air Force is the A-10 Thunderbolt II. The last front line A designated in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps was the A-6 Intruder, with the only strictly A designated fixed-wing aircraft remaining is the A-29 Super Tucano leased under the Imminent Fury program.[7]
Of these code series, no normal aircraft have been assigned a K or R basic mission code in a manner conforming to the system.
Vehicle type [ edit ]
The vehicle type element is used to designate the type of aerospace craft. Aircraft not in one of the following categories (most fixed-wing aircraft) are not required to carry a type designator. The type categories are:
A UAV control segment is not an aircraft, it is the ground control equipment used to command a UAV. Only in recent years has an aircraft been designated as a spaceplane, the proposed MS-1A.
Design number [ edit ]
According to the designation system, aircraft of a particular vehicle type or basic mission (for manned, fixed-wing, powered aircraft) were to be numbered consecutively. Numbers were not to be assigned to avoid confusion with other letter sequences or to conform with manufacturers' model numbers. Recently this rule has been ignored, and aircraft have received a design number equal to the model number (e.g., KC-767A[1]) or have kept the design number when they are transferred from one series to another (e.g., the X-35 became the F-35).
Series letter [ edit ]
Different versions of the same basic aircraft type are to be delineated using a single letter suffix beginning with "A" and increasing sequentially (skipping "I" and "O" to avoid confusion with the numbers "1" and "0"). It is not clear how much modification is required to merit a new series letter, e.g., the F-16C production run has varied extensively over time. The modification of an aircraft to carry out a new mission does not necessarily require a new suffix (e.g., F-111Cs modified for reconnaissance are designated RF-111C), but often a new letter is assigned (e.g., the UH-60As modified for Search and Rescue missions are designated HH-60G).
Non-systematic aircraft designations [ edit ]
Since the 1962 system was introduced there have been several instances of non-systematic aircraft designations and skipping of design numbers.
Non-systematic or aberrant designations [ edit ]
The most common changes are to use a number from another series, or some other choice, rather than the next available number (117, 767, 71). Another is to change the order of the letters or use new acronym based letters (e.g. SR) rather than existing ones. Non-systematic designations are both official and correct, since the DOD has final authority to approve such designations.
Designation conflicted with unrelated C-7 Caribou, redesignated EO-5C in August 2004.[8]
F/A-18 Hornet, also the transient F/A-16 and F/A-22.
Originally, the Navy planned to have two variants of the Hornet: the F-18 fighter and A-18 light attack aircraft. During development, "F/A-18" was used as a shorthand to refer to both variants. When the Navy decided to develop a single aircraft able to perform both missions, the "F/A" appellation stuck. AF-18 or FA-18 would be conformant.
The F designation is expected, but the series number 35 comes from its X-35 designation, rather than the next available F- series number (24).
BF-111, or using a much lower number in the bomber series would have been more systematic but 111 was retained for commonality with the F-111 from the pre-1962 system.
Designated as part of series continuing from the pre-1962 system and latterly used to identify foreign aircraft acquired by the government,[9] e.g., YF-113 was a MiG-23.[10]
The SR-71 designator is a continuation of the pre-1962 bomber series, which ended with the XB-70 Valkyrie. During the later period of its testing, the B-70 was proposed for the reconnaissance/strike role, with an RS-70 designation. The USAF decided instead to pursue an RS-71 version of the Lockheed A-12. Then-USAF Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation and wanted the reconnaissance aircraft to be named SR-71. Before the Blackbird was to be announced by President Johnson on 29 February 1964, LeMay lobbied to modify Johnson's speech to read SR-71 instead of RS-71. The media transcript given to the press at the time still had the earlier RS-71 designation in places, creating the myth that the president had misread the aircraft's designation.[11]
Uses its own modified mission letter (T for Tactical) with basic mission letter (R for Reconnaissance). Later redesignated U-2R after the end of the Cold War in 1991.[12]
Skipped hundreds of C- series numbers to use Boeing's model number. Has conformant basic mission and modified mission letters. Only used for aircraft sold to foreign air forces. The U.S. Air Force ordered the Boeing 767-based tanker KC-46,[13] which is the expected designation following the assignment of "KC-45" to the competing Airbus A330-derived bid, which itself skipped 42-44.
Skipped design numbers [ edit ]
The design number "13" has been skipped in many mission and vehicle series for its association with superstition. Some numbers were skipped when a number was requested and/or assigned to a project but the aircraft was never built.[14]
The following table lists design numbers in the 1962 system which have been skipped.
Mission or Vehicle Series Missing numbers Next available number A 8, 11, 15-28 30 B 3-20 22 C 16, 30, 34, 36, 39, 42–44 47 D (Ground) 5 E 7 12 F 19, 24–34 36 G 17 H 7 L 2 O 7 P 1, 6 10 Q 13 28 R 2 S (ASW) 1 4 S (Spaceplane) 2 T (1962 sequence) 3 T (1990 sequence) 2, 4*, 5* 7 V 14, 17, 19, 21 25 Z 5
*: The T-4 and T-5 designations were skipped in favor of T-6 by Raytheon to honor the WW2-era North American T-6 Texan.[14]
Manufacturer's code [ edit ]
From 1939, a 2-letter manufacturer's code was added to designations to easily identify the manufacturer and the production plant.[15] For example, F-15E-50-MC, the "MC" being the code for the McDonnell Douglas plant at St. Louis, Missouri.
Block number [ edit ]
In 1941 block numbers were added to designations to show minor equipment variations between production blocks.[16] The block number appears in the designation between the model suffix and manufacturers code (for example F-100D-85-NH).[16] Initially they incremented in numerical order -1, -2, -3 but this was changed to -1, -5, -10, -15 in increments of five.[16] The gaps in the block numbers could be used for post-delivery modifications, for example a F-100D-85-NH could be modified in the field to F-100D-86-NH.[16] Not all types have used block numbers.

Some lawmakers are issuing a warning call that next week's meeting between U.S. and Russian government officials should not to spur the opening of Russian compounds closed by the Obama administration after it concluded that Russia had meddled in the U.S. elections.
Four Democratic senators have written a letter to Undersecretary Tom Shannon, who will be meeting with their Russian counterpart on Monday, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov.
"We strongly urge the State Department not to return the diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York to the Government of the Russian Federation at this time," they wrote. "Simply put, the Russian government has done nothing to deserve renewed access to these compounds."
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York hail from the two states where the compounds are located. They believe that keeping the compounds closed and being vigilant in the meeting next week will help "deny the Russian government the ability to advance its interests from within our own states."
Shannon has been tasked with dealing with some of the countries' irritants, including the compounds. The Shannon-Ryabkov meeting was originally scheduled for last month in St. Petersburg but the Russians cancelled it as the U.S. announced it would be continuing the sanctions.
The senators are asking Shannon to meet with the FBI, and they added that the Russian government's "nefarious intentions" toward the U.S. were clarified during in the 2016 election. They also note that the treatment of U.S. personnel in Russia – which reportedly included the slashing of U.S. diplomats' car tires, home break-ins, and some violent attacks – has not "markedly improved." That was a primary reason that the compounds were initially closed. At the time "it had reached Soviet levels," says one former U.S. government official told CBS News.
The Russians have warned of retaliating if the compounds are not opened. "There were several variants of a response and a harsh reaction is prepared," Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told a Russian News agency.
The State Department would not reply to that threat. It has, recently as this week, said that activity was taking place in the compounds that was illegal. This further verifies that the closing of the compounds was not just about retaliating for the treatment of U.S. personnel in Russia.
"Part of the reason that the Russian Government was asked to leave its dachas here in the United States," explained Heather Nauert, State Department spokesperson, was "because we knew that there were some activities taking place in those dachas that were not permitted under U.S. law."
CBS News has reported that when U.S. officials entered shuttered Russian compounds last year they found damaged materials that could have been used in intelligence gathering and that former officials say could have been useful in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The closure of the Russian compounds in November of 2016 took place in conjunction with new Russian sanctions that included the expulsion of 35 Russians who the U.S. said were spies operating under diplomatic cover.
Just a few days ago, President Trump met with President Putin for the first time at the G-20. The U.S. and Russia also agreed, along with Jordan, to a ceasefire in Southwest Syria.
A California history teacher has been placed on paid leave after comparing US president-elect Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler during one of their lessons.
Holocaust scholar Frank Navarro, who has taught at Mountain View High School for 40 years, said the school's principal and district superintendent asked them to leave on Thursday, after a parent sent an email to school officials expressing concerns about a lesson plan for Mr Navarro's world studies class which drew parallels between Mr Trump and the Nazi leader.
“This parent said that I had said Donald Trump was Hitler, but I would never say that,” Mr Navarro told the San Francisco Chronicle on Saturday. “That's sloppy historical thinking.”
Mr Navarro said that they believe that it was appropriate to compare the two men because they think it is "historically factual". Both the president-elect and Hitler, during their rise to power, vowed to deport foreigners and make their country “great again”, they noted.
“This feels like we're trying to squash free speech,” the history teacher told the Monterey Herald. “Everything I talk about is factually based. They can go and check it out. It's not propaganda or bias if it's based on hard facts.”
It won't have escaped your attention rear-driven Lamborghinis don't come around all that often. The Diablo was the last series car to be launched in rear-wheel drive, the Gallardo only got it six years after launch and the Murcielago never had the option.
Matt's poker face needs a little work Matt's poker face needs a little work
Moreover, they don't actually prove that popular. Yes, the Gallardo Balbonis sold out, but how many of themodels do you ever see? Not many. On PH at the moment eight ofare four-wheel drive VTs. And on our recent Italian, not one of the 28 UK customer cars was two-wheel drive.
Therefore it's really quite significant to have this rear-driven Huracan LP580-2 so early in the model's life cycle. It's a series production version too, available just like the standard LP610-4 and Spyder versions. Given they seem to be most popular with journalists rather than the people actually buying them, it's a pleasant surprise to see it introduced. Nice work Lambo!
The f-word
The good news continues. R&D boss Maurizio Reggiani is only too keen to stress the importance of fun in this car's development. Yep, the f-word in a press conference. Indeed, though there's a video of the car pounding round Imola, lap times are never mentioned as a priority. Presumably that will be the job of the Superleggera, or whatever the mega Huracan will be, but we'll return to that later.
Less, apparently, more like it Less, apparently, more like it
The 580, says Reggiani, has been designed and developed on five pillars: handling, power oversteering (really), load transfer, wheel control and steering feeling. A good list. Compared to the four-wheel drive car the 580-2 is 33kg lighter, with the weight balance now 40:60 front to rear. To that end the kinematics of the rear suspension are new, the springs and dampers are tweaked and the driving aids recalibrated to emphasise the "classic oversteering feeling". Finally, but just as importantly, the optional Dynamic Steering has received work as well. Though they are two different systems, you have to guess some of the experience frommust have been incorporated here.
Circuit training
So with that message of pure rear-wheel drive most definitely across, it's time for the track drives at the Losail circuit. Immediately there are positives to report. The Dynamic Steering - it's fitted to every car on the launch - is better, the impression now of a much more consistent system once lock is applied and less need to second-guess inputs. It still feels a little unnatural for those first few degrees off centre but it's much improved. And it's optional, remember.
'Just' 580hp but enough to be going with 'Just' 580hp but enough to be going with
Furthermore, any concerns a power reduction would neuter the Huracan are swiftly allayed. 30hp down it may be, but don't forget that 33kg weight saving too. Any performance difference would need a more seasoned bum dyno than mine because it still feels bloody rapid. It isn't as bombastic as theor, but then it was never going to be with between 70 and 90hp less and a massve gulf in torque. What it does feel is incredibly exciting, the engine rewarding in a way those two turbocharged V8s simply cannot. While they both produce peak power at 7,500rpm and above, they are also making so much torque low down that it can feel unnecessary to extend them that far. In the Lamborghini it's so noticeably more potent and ferocious at high revs and you will find any excuse to let it wail beyond the 8,250rpm power peak to the limiter somewhere past 8,500rpm. Combined with the flawless dual-clutch transmission, it's a stunning powertrain on track.
And the noise. The noise! Of course it's identical to the four-wheel drive car, but the way it growls, barks and shrieks its way to nearly 9,000rpm must be celebrated again. Lamborghini wants to stick with atmospheric engines for as long as possible, and it takes one run through third gear in this to be reminded why it really, really must. It's an absolute joy.
Slightly changed 'face' but otherwise visually identical Slightly changed 'face' but otherwise visually identical
Given our time with the Huracan is solely on circuit, it makes sense to skip the Strada and Sport modes nice and quickly to give Corsa a try, tuned as it is "to provide oversteering characteristics". Before that though you will notice a keener front end, the lack of weight over that axle making an immediate difference. It turns in more sharply and, though the steering still isn't that detailed, you know that understeer is through too much corner speed and not the four-wheel drive juggling things round. Though the Huracan is dynamically very safe, the 580-2 puts you at ease more swiftly than the 610-4.
So what of the "classic oversteering feeling"? Well it's certainly there! Keep the power on through that initial understeer and it will gradually bleed away as the momentum moves rearwards. The messages come through your bum rather than the wheel but the corrective inputs are instinctive and the car feels totally composed and faithful as the rear Pirelli PZeros (also new for this application) just begin to overspeed.
The purist's Lambo ... but do purists buy 'em? The purist's Lambo ... but do purists buy 'em?
Frustratingly though the electronics don't feel as advanced as in the competition. Yes, the ESC has a high enough threshold in Corsa mode, but whereas in the McLaren and Ferrari it feels like the assists are there to, well, assist in your showboating, the Huracan is more strait-laced. The power is cut and you're straightened up smartly; it feels more like admonishment for breaching a limit rather than a helping hand like Side Slip Control. Work at the Lamborghini though and there's a nice operating window just below the ESC intervention, and it's certainly more entertaining than the four-wheel drive car. We'll aim to get the car on track in the UK for some huge drif - sorry, a more thorough test - as soon as we can.
And with the ESC off? Well the car is in one piece and there were no tears or screaming, so that's something. In fact the 580 feels superb beyond the limit, the rear following round really progressively in its slightly wider arc. That beautifully responsive engine means minute adjustments can be made, the car revelling in this slightly naughty cornering state. The problem comes - or at least this is the excuse you're getting after only a lap of practice - with the Dynamic Steering, its odd response making it hard to judge those last few degrees of lock as the slide is corrected. Then you'll get spotted with a slightly errant drift and be told off. Sorry. But with the normal steering - or most likely a more talented driver - the Huracan has all the makings of a rear-wheel drive Lamborghini that wants to indulge your hooligan side while also not actively trying to kill you. Hurrah!
Optional ceramics started to wilt Optional ceramics started to wilt
Along with the Dynamic Steering, all cars at the launch were equipped with the carbon ceramic brakes, which will be optional on the LP580-2. Do you need them? Tricky one. While their performance on track was good, the pedal went a little long after just a few laps. And at no point were they as confidence inspiring as you would find in a - you've guessed it - 488 or 650S, or even an Aston V12 Vantage.
Elsewhere the Huracan LP580-2 is as you were for the 610-4, which means very good. The wheels are new and the styling ever so slightly different but they haven't detracted from the jaw-dropping looks one little bit. The interior, while not as driver centric as the Ferrari's or minimalist as the McLaren's, is very stylish and simple to use.
To conclude, it really is very hard to see why anyone would buy a four-wheel drive Huracan over a two-wheel drive version. This new 580 is not only more fun to drive, it will be cheaper too; UK prices aren't yet confirmed, but we're told to expect a 13 per cent drop over the 610 and a list price of "around £160,000". It's therefore within McLaren570S territory and, moreover, gives the Huracan a unique selling point over the Audi R8, which can be specced to around £150,000 quite easily.
At present the Huracan simply isn't as rewarding or immersive as either of the McLarens or the Ferrari. But remember this is just the start for rear-wheel drive Huracans. Reggiani says a Pirelli Trofeo tyre is due soon and there will inevitably be faster Huracans on the way. If response to this car is good - and there's every reason it should be - who's to say we couldn't see a return to the lightweight and focused rear-drive Lambos? There's a factory racing car plus the success of the Aventador SV to build on. A Huracan GT3-R could be magnificent. The fun objective has most definitely been achieved for the two-wheel drive Huracan then, but the most exciting news is that there's even more to come.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators on Thursday urged federal authorities to halt the planned expansion of a $1 billion airport facial scanning program, saying the technology used to identify travelers on some flights departing from nine U.S. airports for international destinations may not be not accurate enough and raises privacy concerns.
Congress has approved the use of the program for non-U.S. citizens, but never expressly authorized its use for Americans. The Department of Homeland Security has said the system is needed to prevent travelers from leaving the country using someone else's identity and to prevent visitors to the United States from overstaying their visas.
Senators Mike Lee, a Republican, and Edward Markey, a Democrat, in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, raised concerns that too many travelers would be inconvenienced by faulty scan results and questioned why Americans are being subjected to the screens, known as biometric exit detection technology.
In the letter, they raised objections to expanding the program beyond the nine airports where it is already in use.
“We request that DHS stop the expansion of this program and provide Congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on U.S. citizens,” the senators wrote. “If there is no specific authorization, then we request an explanation for why DHS believes it has the authority to proceed”
They cited a report released Thursday by Georgetown University Law School's Center on Privacy & Technology that found DHS is conducting the scans “without basic legal and technical safeguards - or any meaningful justification of its billion-dollar cost.”
Congress in 2016 authorized spending up to $1 billion over 10 years on the facial scans.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on its website, says the program collects “facial images from all travelers from the United States” on a flight and uses the images to verify identities. It says the images are stored for no more than two weeks and says that “CBP is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all travelers.”
The government said Thursday that U.S. citizens may opt out of the facial screening and instead have a separate review of their ID documents.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said the government is working to establish the biometric exit program “in a way that's most efficient and secure for the traveler and that is least disruptive for the travel industry.”
Airports using the system include Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York's John F. Kennedy, Washington Dulles, both Houston airports, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta.
The senators want DHS to provide data that the program will not unduly burden travelers. DHS said previously its goal is a 96 percent “true accept rate,” meaning the technology can positively identify 96 percent of the faces it scans.
The senators, however, said this meant “there would still be a false denial for one in 25 travelers. Further there is evidence that certain face scans exhibit different error rate depending on the race or gender of the person being scanned.”
DHS has said travelers who cannot be verified are escorted to another area where Customs and Border Patrol uses other methods to verify their identity.
The Georgetown Law report also noted that DHS has not established any rules governing the program.
“It's as if DHS has hired a billion-dollar bouncer to check IDs but never checked how good they are at spotting a fake,” said Laura Moy, deputy director of the center and co-author of the report. “They also don't know if he's biased against certain groups of people.”
The senators said DHS also needed safeguards to ensure facial data is not shared with other U.S. agencies.
Both of New Mexico's U.S. senators support the “Medicare for all” legislation proposed by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich each said Tuesday they would cosponsor the effort.
“I believe that health care is a human right, and that all New Mexicans – and all Americans – should be able to see a doctor when they're sick,” Udall said. “A hardworking single mother in New Mexico deserves the same quality health care for themselves and their family as a multimillionaire CEO. But while we've made strong steps in the right direction, our health insurance system is expensive, fragmented and hopelessly complicated for patients and employers alike.”
“America is the wealthiest country on Earth, yet despite our healthcare progress in recent years, we still spend far too much of our GDP on health care and some New Mexicans still find themselves without any coverage at all,” Heinrich said. “It is time to recognize that health care is a human right and I believe that the best way to make that a reality in our nation is to build on what we all know works. Americans across the political spectrum recognize just how well the Medicare program delivers quality health care results at a reasonable cost.”
Expanded health care coverage through efforts such as making Medicare available to all Americans has increasingly become popular among Democrats recently, especially since the 2016 elections.
Just this week, Democratic Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Jeff Merkley of Oregon announced they support the proposal by Sanders.
The bill isn't likely to pass in the current Congress, as both chambers have Republican majorities. Conservative Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia said they were skeptical of such a single-payer plan. Even if it were passed, Republican President Donald Trump would likely veto the bill.
Still, the effort indicates the Democratic party may be moving left on health care.
Sanders is widely expected to seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2020 after losing to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.
Already, other high profile Democratic senators like Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California signed onto the bill. Some of those cosponsors could be opponents of Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primary.
This isn't the first time that Udall has supported the concept. While a member of the U.S. House, Udall supported similar proposals by Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, in three different years.
Update: Added statement by Martin Heinrich to the story.
Islamic State's last stronghold, Raqqa, has fallen. But the world's attention must now focus on what it or other Islamist groups will plot next
For a group with such spectacular ambitions, Islamic State's last stand took place in surroundings of almost shocking banality: a hospital and sports stadium in Raqqa, the Syrian town that was the political capital of its self-styled caliphate. After weeks of street-to-street battles and bombing, these final strongholds fell to Kurdish fighters last week. More than three years after Isis surged to global infamy with a stunning campaign of conquest, the end came with a whimper, not a bang.
“Once purported as fierce, now pathetic and a lost cause,” Brett McGurk, the US special presidential envoy for coalition forces tweeted. Such triumphant claims have become familiar since the 9/11 attacks. I heard them in Afghanistan in 2002, but US troops are still engaged in the fight against the Taliban. I heard them in Iraq in 2003, 2004, and then year after year until the US pulled out in 2011.
The scepticism with which any talk of “victory” is greeted by analysts and reporters is familiar, too. Many expert observers counselled prudence rather than celebration last week: Raqqa may have fallen, but if Isis is down, it is far from out.
Raqqa: a journey into the destroyed heart of the Islamic State capital Read more
Yet when we recall Isis at the height of its powers, the scale of its decline is impressive. By mid-2014 the group controlled a taxable population of some seven or eight million, oilfields and refineries, vast grain stores, lucrative smuggling routes and vast stockpiles of arms and ammunition, as well as entire parks of powerful modern military hardware. Its economic capital was Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. Isis was the most powerful, wealthiest, best-equipped jihadi force ever seen.
Its success sent shockwaves throughout the Islamic world. What al-Qaida, founded by Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 1988, had talked about doing decades or centuries in the future, an upstart breakaway faction had done in months. Its blitzkrieg campaign and the refounding of an Islamic caliphate – announced from the pulpit of a 950-year-old mosque in Mosul in a speech by its leader, Ibrahim Awwad, the 46-year-old former Islamic law student better known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi – easily eclipsed the 9/11 attacks as Islamist extremists' most spectacular achievement.
In 2014 and 2015, I interviewed young men, and some women, who had found the call of Isis irresistible. They came from Belgium and the Maldives, both thousands of miles from the Levant. A few returned to their homelands to proselytise or, in Europe, to carry out some of the most infamous terrorist attacks ever. Isis inspired others who had not travelled to execute their own attacks, too. From Bangladesh to Florida, hundreds died in a new wave of terrorist acts. A dozen or so Isis “provinces” were established, from West Africa to eastern Asia.
Yet this vast and ambitious project has been reduced to rubble. As many as 60,000 Isis fighters have died since 2014, according to senior US military officials. The leadership has shrunk to a rump – although al-Baghdadi survives. The administration is no more. The training camps are gone. The flow of propaganda so instrumental in prompting attacks such as those in the UK this year has ceased. One recent analysis noted that, after the fall of Mosul in July 2017, the Isis distribution of governance-related media, which long constituted the bulk of its propaganda output, dropped by two-thirds. In mid-September it ended entirely.
If the defeat of Isis did not come easily, three inherent weaknesses of its project always made it likely in the long term. First, Isis needed continual conquest to succeed: victory was a clear sign that the group was doing God's work. Expansion also meant new recruits to replace combat casualties, arms and ammunition to acquire, archaeological treasures to sell, property to loot, food to distribute and new communities and resources, such as oil wells and refineries, to exploit.
But once it had occupied its Sunni-dominated heartlands, further expansion was unlikely. If it was easy to sweep aside a border of a shattered state such as Syria, the frontiers of stronger states such as Turkey, Israel and Jordan proved resistant. There was no way even Isis, a Sunni Arab Muslim force, was going to fight its way deep into Shia-dominated central and southern Iraq.
Second, the violent intolerance of dissent and brutality by Isis towards the communities under its authority sapped support. One reason for the rapid expansion of Isis was that Sunni tribal leaders and other power brokers in Iraq and Syria could see significant advantages in accepting the group's authority. Its rule brought relative security, a rude form of justice, and defence against perceived Shia and regime oppression. And assent to Isis takeover also ensured, or at least made more likely, their own survival.

In 2015, with a weakened Isis unable to offer anything other than violence, the defections started and rapidly snowballed. A collective yearning to restore the military, political and technological superiority over the west enjoyed by Islamic powers a millennium ago – or the conviction that the end times are near – proved insufficient to convince communities to fight and die for the Isis cause. At the very end, the hospital and stadium in Raqqa were defended by foreign Isis fighters. Any remaining Syrian militants had surrendered days before.

Third, Isis took on the west. This was a conscious decision, hard-wired into the movement, and not taken in self-defence as some have suggested. The first terrorist attackers were dispatched by Isis to Europe in early 2014, before the US-led coalition began airstrikes. The combination of western firepower and funding for local forces has repeatedly proved a potent one in Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, Libya, Mali and elsewhere. Outright victory against jihadis is difficult to achieve, but militant organisations targeted by the west are usually forced at the very least to abandon territorial gains, particularly urban centres.
It is clear that any victory over Isis is partial. The recent military offensive has not been accompanied by a parallel political effort. There are still deep wells of resentment and fear among Iraqi Sunnis, and the Syrian civil war grinds on. Isis will now return to the vicious and effective insurgency it ran before the spectacular campaigns of 2014. The project of constructing an Islamic state has been defeated, but the organisation has not.
Yet there is still cause for optimism. The three key challenges that undermined the Isis state-building project also face every other militant group, and always will. Neither veteran jihadis such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, who leads al-Qaida, nor younger hotheads have found a way to overcome them. Al-Zawahiri now advises a “softly, softly” approach to win hearts and minds locally, which appears to have paid dividends in Syria, and encourages tactical withdrawal from territory such as that seized in Yemen by their group's affiliate there, rather than bloody final battles.
But if any other group seized a swath of the Middle East as Isis did, it would face the same outcome: bloody failure.
But if al-Qaida or any other group seized a swath of the Middle East and attempted to govern it as Isis did, it would face the same outcome: bloody and expensive failure. If they don't seize territory, they must rely on spectacular terrorism to mobilise and radicalise the world's Muslims, a long-term strategy which has had some results, but is of patchy efficacy.
Isis can still do very great harm to Iraq, Syria and the broader region. But can it do similar harm to the west?
The group poses a threat to people in the UK, US, Europe and elsewhere through affiliated groups, the fighters it dispatches to wreak havoc, and those it inspires. The threat from all of these will change dramatically now that the caliphate is no more.
The effect on the “provinces” established over the past three years will vary. Some currently affiliated groups have long been more influenced by what is happening in their immediate environment than thousands of miles away. Their active commitment to “global jihad”, and thus attacks on western targets, will now diminish still further. This is heartening.

Nor is there much chance that an Isis “province” could become a substitute base for the caliphate. Iraq and Syria have unique historic and religious significance that cannot be replicated elsewhere. The suggestion that the Philippines could be the seat of the caliphate is risible. Then there are the foreign fighters. History – particularly the exodus of extremists from Afghanistan in the early 1990s and then again in 2002 – suggests that those from across the Islamic world will have a very powerful impact. But so far the much feared wave of violence perpetrated by Isis veterans returning from the Middle East has not occurred. The UK has suffered several attacks in rapid succession, but these did not involve men who had been to Syria or Iraq. Andrew Parker, director general of MI5, warned last week of a “dramatic upshift” in Islamist terrorism in part because of the potential return of 850 Britons who had travelled to Isis territory and had not been killed. But they admitted that a large influx had not yet materialised.
This leaves the possibility that Isis can inspire people in coming months and years to commit atrocities in the way it has done in the recent past.
The UK law-enforcement and security community has been debating this question for a year or more. Some believe that Isis can exist as a “virtual caliphate”, sustained by online propaganda, which would exert the same pull on recruits in the west as before. But this is to misunderstand the appeal of the group in London, Birmingham, Paris, Antwerp or Berlin. Many recruits from the UK, Belgium or France were young men of immigrant background with records for petty, and sometimes serious, crime and a superficial knowledge of the faith they professed to follow. Isis offered everything a street gang does – adventure, status, even financial and sexual opportunity – but with the bonus of redemption from past sins and resolution of a complex identity crisis. A weakened Isis, stripped of its territories, is no longer “the biggest … baddest gang around”, as one former Belgian Isis recruit described the group to me two years ago, and so the attraction is no longer there.
There have been four big waves of Islamist militancy over the past 50 years. The first two – in the late 1970s and early 80s, and then in the early 90s – remained largely limited to the Muslim world. The third and the fourth – from the mid-90s through to 2010, and from then until now – have combined great violence in Muslim-majority countries with a series of spectacular attacks in the west.
All four have followed a similar trajectory: a slow, unnoticed period of growth, a spectacular event bringing the new threat to public attention, a phase of brutal struggle, then retreat.
One reason we often miss the first phase of a growing threat is that we are focused on the last phase of a threat that is declining. We should bear this in mind as we contemplate the smoking ruins of Raqqa's hospital and sports stadium. But a victory is a victory, and there are few reasons for cheer these days. So let us celebrate the defeat of Islamic State and its hateful so-called caliphate – and keep a wary eye out for the next fight.

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region –A Kurdish female student in Turkey gets the highest marks in their last year of high school and becomes the first among 2.2 million students across the country.
Zainab Kaya, 18, receives full marks in all subjects in 2017 university entrance exams.
Kaya, of Ahsana high school in the city of Bingol in northern Kurdistan, or southeastern Turkey got 500, full grade in four of six subjects, making them secure the first place in Turkey.
Kaya has told the Turkish media that they had expected to receive a high mark, but not taking the first place.
“I had been waiting for the announcement of the results for a long time. I visited the exam results website at least 300 times,” they said. “When the results were out I did not believe it and when I knew I got the first place I became very happy.”
Kaya, the top ranking student dreams to study medicine at a good university.
Over 2, 265,000 students took part in this year's final high school exams throughout Turkey.
Mehmet Emin, Zainab's father also expressed joy for the great success their daughter has achieved.
“I have never forced my daughter or pressured on them to study. They have received the result from their hard work,” Emin said.
They said when they knew their daughter was number one across the country; they immediately called their teachers and thanked their contribution in Zainab's success.
Nick Bosa is passionate about the art of rushing the quarterback.
When providing an example of what they like about their role on the football field, Bosa cited – as one would expect – a particular defensive lineman for an NFL franchise in Los Angeles.
Obviously, Bosa has spent countless hours watching and working out with their older brother, Joey Bosa of the Los Angeles Chargers.
But when describing the process of fine-tuning their technique and adding new moves to their repertoire, they spoke of studying Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald, the two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year.
“A lot of players right now are using a cross-chop move that is kind of new to the NFL,” Bosa told NBC Sports Bay Area. “Aaron Donald likes to use it. It's working out pretty well for him. Just seeing stuff like that, guys using new moves and then getting together and talking to them is pretty fun.
“You just start doing it in practice a little bit and work on it. Maybe you work on it on scout team and in a one-on-one. Then you get to full speed and you hit one good, and it's one of your moves and you can use it.”
The NFL Scouting Combine is this week in Indianapolis. Bosa, whose final season at Ohio State was cut short due to surgery to repair a core-muscle injury, is expected to take part in all the testing Sunday during their on-field workout. If they are satisifed with the results, they likely will not work out at Ohio State's pro day next month.
But Bosa's value goes far beyond their height, weight, speed and all the other measurables. They enjoy the process of experimenting and adding elements to their game.
“It's fun to me, just trying to get better,” Bosa said. “Pass rushing is full of little nuances. And it's fun for me to find new ways to get better.”
First-round NFL draft picks run in the family.
John Bosa, father of Joey and Nick, was a first-round draft pick as a defensive lineman for the Miami Dolphins in 1987. A year later, the Dolphins selected outside linebacker Eric Kumerow in the first round. John Bosa married Kumerow's sister, Cheryl. Joey Bosa, John and Chery's eldest son, was the No. 3 overall pick of the Chargers in 2016.
Nick Bosa might be even further along at this stage than their older brother because of the knowledge they have picked up along the way, according to their dad.
“Nick is a little more advanced because of the mentoring he's had from Joey," John Bosa said. "His combination is just scary. Nick is unbelievably, uncannily strong.
“He's played with leverage since they were in youth football. They know and understands leverage and how they can throw guys around. And he's just really a scary combination of size, speed and technique. He's got great technique.”
If the Arizona Cardinals do not select Nick Bosa with the top overall selection, the 49ers could grab them to help solve their issues at edge rusher with the No. 2 pick.
Joey Bosa, who measured 6-foot-5 ¼, 269 pounds at the combine three years ago, has recorded 28.5 sacks in their 35-game NFL career. Nick Bosa was listed at 6-4, 263 pounds at Ohio State, where they recorded 17.5 sacks in 29 games over three seasons.
[49ers NFL Scouting Combine preview: A draft need filled in every round]
“As far as players, they're both great players and they have a lot of similarities,” John Bosa said. “But if you watch their games, they're a little bit different. Joey is a little longer and leaner, has a little more of that edge, hand-fighting. Nick is coming along with that. But they're both elite in slightly different ways.
“But you really can't compare them until Nick has a Rookie of the Year and a Pro Bowl. Then, we can start comparing them.”

Supporters of a Wisconsin dairy farmer facing a criminal trial for selling raw milk hope they can turn up interest in jury nullification among residents of Sauk County who might be seated to hear their case.
As Rick Barrett reports in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a Washington-based group defending the farmer thinks the approach can work. In fact, a Minnesota farmer was recently acquitted of similar charges there, mostly likely because of jury nullification.
But jury nullification is always a dicey tactic. Lawyers can't openly ask juries to ignore the law, and judges' radar is usually pretty sensitive to veiled efforts to make that point. Federal court officials have been known to run off nullification advocates trying to present pamphlets to jurors as they enter and exit courthouses during trials.
While rare, nullification does come up in emotional cases like those involving anti-abortion activists, tax protesters and some drug cases -- but also in any case where the jury can be persuaded that to follow the law would be an injustice.
There's even a national organization devoted to the topic, the Fully Informed Jury Association. It believes juries should always be told, not just the law applicable to the case they're considering, but also that they have the power and authority to follow their conscience.
According to the FIJA website, the primary purpose of the jury is "to protect fellow citizens from tyrannical abuses of power by government."
It has been used for some high purposes, such as saving runaway slaves when they were charged in northern states, but also to clear whites of crimes against blacks in racist Southern communities last century.
No surprise that FIJA or its beliefs don't get a shout-out this month, which Wisconsin's court system recognizes as Juror Appreciation Month.
Michele Eichhorn thought they were making a wise investment in April when they and their husband opted to buy solar panels for their family home in River Ridge. They felt a sense of pride when they first saw sun glinting off the panels on their rooftop.
Today, they look up and feels duped.
Eichhorn's family is among hundreds across Louisiana thrust into financial limbo after the state Department of Revenue warned in July it has run out of money to fund tax credits once meant to promote solar purchases.
It's been a year since Louisiana lawmakers decided to cap the solar tax credit program in the face of worsening budget woes. Not only did lawmakers impose a cap, they also widened it to cover to everyone who purchased solar in 2015, including those who bought their systems well before any changes were proposed.
Louisiana has no more tax credits for solar owners The solar tax credit program was capped in 2015.
That has left Eichhorn and others like them scrambling to cobble together thousands of dollars to pay loans now coming due on their panels. Many are starting to lose hope they will see a credit at all.
Eichhorn, who owns four travel health clinics in south Louisiana and has two children, one in college and one finishing high school, expected to pay about $5,000 out of pocket for their panels. Them family must fork over $17,500 without the state credit.
Eichhorn said they would not have bought solar panels had they known lawmakers would change the rules midstream, but "there was no way I could have known."
Whether their family gets the solar tax credits it applied for is not a political debate over the value of solar -- it's about the value of the state's word, they said.
"This is not an issue of whether solar is good or bad or whether poor people get solar or rich people get solar," Eichhorn said. "It's the fact that the state said, 'This is what we have available for you,' and then changed its mind after the fact with no warning or recourse."
First come, first served
As it stands, Louisiana's solar tax credit is among the most generous in the country, covering up to 50 percent of the first $25,000 spent to install a rooftop solar system, or up to $12,500 total. It can be combined with a 30 percent federal tax credit for extra savings.
The program had a 2017 sunset, but lawmakers went a step further last year and capped credits for purchased systems at $25 million. That included a $10 million cap in 2015 and 2016, and a $5 million cap in 2017.
As of July 27, the state had either approved or reviewed nearly 3,500 solar tax credit claims, exceeding the cap by about $14 million, according to figures provided by the Department of Revenue.

Most solar advocates begrudgingly accept the cap on credits. But they say the 2015 law's retroactive clause and the fact that credits are handed out on a first-come, first-served basis have created a nonsensical mess of the program. They argue credits should instead be prioritized by the date solar panels were installed.
"These folks are not fat cats. These folks are mostly working class people," said Jude Heath, a Metairie CPA working with several dozen solar clients. "It's going to hurt for them to lose that $12,000."
Revenue Secretary Kimberly Robinson said their department must apply the law as it is written. That includes the first come, first served rule.
Robinson said credits for 2016 have already been maxed out. Taxpayers who are getting a tax credit in 2017 will receive their money by September. Taxpayers approved for a credit in 2018 will receive notice by mail this September, though they will have to wait until next August for payment.
Robinson said the department has three solar specialists working on thousands of applications, many of which lack full documentation. It will take time sort through everything, they said.
"We're trying to make this process as easy as possible for taxpayers," they said.
'It's just wrong'
In the meantime, many solar owners have to find another way to pay off short-term loans used to cover the cost of installing their panels.
So-called "bridge" loans installation companies offer to help customers pay for panels until their tax credits come through. They do not charge interest if you pay them off in full when they come due. But if you can't pay off the loan, a high interest rate -- up to 18 percent -- kicks in and is compounds monthly for the full duration of the loan, typically around 18 months.
Louisiana Legislature votes to fully fund TOPS for fall semester, leaving larger cut for the spring That means students would receive a scholarship covering full tuition for the fall semester.
James Michael Baker, who had solar panels installed on their Metairie home in May 2015, is tapping into retirement savings to pay the $12,500 coming due on their system in October.
Baker, a science teacher for Louisiana Virtual Charter Academy, said they and their wife hired a CPA this year to ensure their tax return was filed quickly. They got word of the tax credit changes late last summer from their solar company.
The first-come, first-served law turned the credit queue "into the 'Hunger Games' of whoever gets their W-2s first," they said. Baker and their wife, who works in retail, filed a zero-income return in January to get the process started, planning to amend it as soon as they received a paper wage statement in the mail (his employer did not provide the form electronically).
Baker suspects their return was knocked to the back of the line, causing them to miss out on a 2016 credit. They haven't been able to get any details on their claim despite multiple calls to the state.
"I can't believe it's my own state government doing this to me. If this were a business that did this, the government would get involved and shut them down," Baker said. "It's bad to do this to people. It's just wrong."
Uptown resident Dave Holt said they faxed their completed paperwork at least four times to the state for credits on solar panels they installed on their historic home in February 2015. They noted taxpayers were forced to file an electronic return in order to make a claim, yet the state's entire review process was manual.
"It started to feel like, 'Are they just delaying because Louisiana is broke?'" they said, adding they are still waiting on their $2,000 state refund.
Holt, a construction project manager, said they would have invested in solar panels without the credit.  They are worried about climate change, but they like saving money on their power bill.

But Holt said they would have taken more time to pull the trigger. They will break even on their panels later this year if they receive a tax credit; without it, the panels will start paying off in 2023.
They plan on taking out a home equity loan to pay down a $12,500 bridge loan due in September. Their advice to those now considering solar?
"You're going to have to be rich to get them," they said.
Taxpayers can appeal
Robinson said taxpayers who are denied a credit will be able to appeal the decision before the Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals. Directions on how to do so will be included in denial letters sent to taxpayers, they said.
Eichhorn received a letter July 21 notifying them that the 2016 credit had been met and they can try again for the credit next year. They said they are fortunate enough to be able to come up with the money to pay down their $12,500 loan, which is due Aug. 7. Others aren't so lucky, they said.
Gov. Bobby Jindal and politicians had years to fix the state's financial problems, they said, but instead swept them under the rug to the detriment of working families.
Eichorn and Holt noted they both have college-aged children who benefit from TOPS scholarships, another program seeing cutbacks as Louisiana tries to address its deficit.
Families can do their best to plan ahead, but "some things you just can't foresee," Eichorn said.

Red Bull does not intend to renew its contract with Toro Rosso driver Daniil Kvyat for 2017.
That is the claim of the Russian news agency Izvestia, citing the information of a source close to the energy drink company.
Earlier, officials including Dr Helmut Marko and Franz Tost sounded upbeat about the young Russian's future, but the source now gives a different account.
“Red Bull had hoped the return to Toro Rosso would embolden Kvyat, relieving the pressure on him,” the source is quoted as saying.
“It was expected that they would score points regularly and become an example for (Carlos) Sainz.
“But in the last seven races, Daniil appeared very uneasy against their teammate, and the most recent setbacks seem to have finally convinced Helmut Marko to not renew the contract.”
Izvestia said Frenchman Pierre Gasly seems first in line for the seat, with 22-year-old Kvyat reportedly on Williams' 2017 shortlist.
Red Bull declined to comment.

Children of obese parents may be at risk for developmental delays, according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. The investigators found that children of obese mothers were more likely to fail tests of fine motor skill—the ability to control movement of small muscles, such as those in the fingers and hands. Children of obese fathers were more likely to fail measures of social competence, and those born to extremely obese couples also were more likely to fail tests of problem-solving ability.
The study, appearing in Pediatrics, was conducted by scientists at the NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
“The previous U.S. studies in this area have focused on the mothers' pre- and post-pregnancy weight,” said the study's first author, Edwina Yeung, Ph.D., an investigator in NICHD's Division of Intramural Population Health Research. “Our study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers, and our results suggest that dad's weight also has significant influence on child development.”
Dr. Yeung and their coauthors cited research indicating that about 1 in 5 pregnant women in the United States is overweight or obese.
In the study, authors reviewed data collected from the Upstate KIDS study, which originally sought to determine if fertility treatments could affect child development from birth through age 3. More than 5,000 women enrolled in the study roughly 4 months after giving birth in New York State (excluding New York City) between 2008 and 2010. To assess development, parents completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire after performing a series of activities with their children. The test isn't used to diagnose specific disabilities, but serves as a screen for potential problems, so that children can be referred for further testing.
Children in the study were tested at 4 months of age and retested 6 more times through age 3. When they enrolled, mothers also provided information on their health and weight—before and after pregnancy—and the weight of their partners.
Compared to children of normal weight mothers, children of obese mothers were nearly 70 percent more likely to have failed the test indicator on fine motor skill by age 3. Children of obese fathers were 75 percent more likely to fail the test's personal-social domain—an indicator of how well they were able to relate to and interact with others by age 3. Children with two obese parents were nearly three times more likely to fail the test's problem-solving section by age 3.
It is not known why parental obesity might increase children's risk for developmental delay. The authors note that animal studies indicate that obesity during pregnancy may promote inflammation, which could affect the fetal brain. Less information is available on the potential effects of paternal obesity on child development. The authors added that some studies have indicated that obesity could affect the expression of genes in sperm.
If the link between parental obesity and developmental delays is confirmed, the authors wrote, physicians may need to take parental weight into account when screening young children for delays and early interventional services.

Emilie Fougerolles voted for the far left in 2012 and is "troubled by the racism" of France's far-right National Front, but nevertheless they are seriously thinking of voting for its presidential candidate Marine Le Pen next year.
The 34-year-old sales clerk lives in the Paris dormitory town of Mantes-la-Ville, one of 10 cities the National Front (FN) seized control of during municipal elections in 2014.
Since then, residents are relieved that "nothing has changed in our daily lives," Fougerolles said in the low-rise town some 50 kilometres (30 miles) west of the French capital.
The string of jihadist attacks that have claimed 238 lives in France since January 2015 have contributed to the shift in the town of around 20,000 inhabitants.
'Permanent fear'
"We live in permanent fear," said Fougerolles, who was especially shaken by the jihadist murder in June this year of a police officer and their companion in Magnanville, just a few kilometres away.
One of their four daughters was taking a judo class only 200 metres (yards) away from the scene of the attack at the time.
That was when Fougerolles began taking an interest in Le Pen. "She has good ideas when it comes to terrorism," Fougerolles said. "If their name weren't Le Pen I would have no doubts at all about voting for her."
The 48-year-old FN leader is the youngest daughter of the fiery and openly xenophobic Jean-Marie Le Pen, who led the party for nearly 40 years.
Since succeeding them in 2011 they have worked to shed the party's racist and anti-Semitic image while hoping to capitalise on economic gloom and concern about Europe's biggest migrant crisis since World War II.
As part of this strategy, they have reportedly instructed FN mayors not to make waves in their cities.
Cyril Nauth, a 35-year-old history and geography teacher and the first FN mayor in the Paris region, failed to see through on their campaign promises to block a new mosque in Mantes-la-Ville, though they have cut subsidies to civic groups.
Le Pen has also seized on the fears generated by the attacks with promises of boosting security and countering perceived Islamic inroads into French society.
The so-called "de-demonising" strategy has translated into votes, and the party won 28 percent in the first round of last year's regional elections, though it was defeated in the run-off when the mainstream parties worked together to block it.
Now, thanks partly to deep disarray on the left, voter surveys predict that Le Pen will come in second or even first in the first round of the presidential vote in April, qualifying them for the May run-off.
 They are then tipped to lose, most likely to the newly chosen rightwing candidate Francois Fillon.
But after the shock election of Donald Trump in the United States, no-one is writing off Le Pen's chances.
'I won't hide it'
Franck Party, a 49-year-old supermarket manager, said they would "never" have voted for Jean-Marie Le Pen because they are "too over the top," but they have voted FN since Marine took over.
"Her positions on defending France's identity resonate with me," they said, adding that they oppose "mass immigration" and the "dictatorship of Brussels".
Like Party, many residents of Mantes-la-Ville, which is slightly poorer than the national average, make no bones about voting FN.
"I won't hide it," said Alain Baudouin, a 56-year-old former carworker who has taken early retirement, slamming "these immigrants who have everything".
A former mason who gave their name only as Frederic agreed, saying they were sacked "because of Turkish and Polish workers", adding: "Vive the FN".
Patricia, a 58-year-old woman who works at Mantes-la-Ville's town hall, said they did not regret voting FN in the 2014 municipal elections, and said they would vote for Le Pen in 2017.
Like Fougerolles, they have seen little change in the city. "Maybe the streets are cleaner?" they said, before adding that for them the main thing is:"We need to revitalise France!"
A woman in their 70s who declined to give their name said they voted for the FN mayor because they were "fed up of state handouts and immigrants."
But when it comes to the presidency, they said they preferred Fillon. Being mayor is "after all not the same as running a country," they said.

A photo posted online of a Calgary woman standing with their dog as it defecated on a gravesite has sparked a debate on public shaming.
It all started at St. Mary's Cemetery in the city's southwest — a place that clearly states “no dogs within this area.”
The cemetery has marked signs saying no dogs are allowed in the area. (CBC)
In an obvious attempt to shame the pet owner, the photographer posted the picture to the online forum calgarypuck.com.
"After being notified that dogs are not allowed, this woman admitted to knowing that dogs aren't allowed (apparently the rules don't apply to her).... I hope a dog craps on them grave. What a disrespectful woman," said the post.
The response was massive and included more than a dozen pages of feedback.
"This is irresponsible pet ownership,” stated one post.
Another post targeted the photographer.
"Kinda weak to take the woman's picture and post it on a forum for public shaming."
Public shaming popular on social media
Calgary blogger Mike Morrison says public shaming is becoming more popular in this age of social media.
"I mean I don't know why if you had such a problem with it why you can't just say something and it ends there."
Morrison believes online forums can be a positive place for discussion, but they say this post is a bit over the top.
"It's like when people take photos of people on C-Trains or things like that — like this person is behaving bad. There's no privacy anymore and everything is up for public consumption and I don't think that's fair," they said.
Other Calgarians walking through a local dog park agree.
"There's obviously a lot of people sitting on their butts at home with not much to do," said Kelly Leech.
"She shouldn't have been there, but I think it might be a good idea to take a picture and then contact the city or police but posting — everything gets posted on social media — and that's the real problem," said Louise Forsyth.
With almost 4m tonnes of food from the commercial sector going to landfill, social enterprise Yume connects suppliers with restaurants and other buyers
We grow it, we waste it, we dump it: fighting food waste one click at a time
Australians eat more salmon than any other fish – six times more than tuna and 16 times more than barramundi. But even then, suppliers of the pink-hued fish were overly optimistic about our appetites at Christmas.
About six tonnes of unsold middle cuts of salmon landed on the online wholesale food marketplace Yume after the holiday season, says Katy Barfield, who launched Yume as a social enterprise a year ago to combat food waste.
Yume connects suppliers of hard-to-sell produce with commercial buyers and food rescue organisations.
In this case, the salmon was sold to a broker who exported it to Papua New Guinea, saving it from becoming landfill and, perhaps, delighting the families of Port Moresby with an estimated 33,000 fish dinners.

“It had six months [expiry date] on it. It really is confronting,” says Barfield, who has an 11-year history of working to prevent food waste.
Food waste is a huge problem. About 3.9m tonnes from Australia's commercial food sector goes into landfill every year.
“Of that, 400,000 to 600,000 tonnes is useable, edible, available now and should be rescued now,” Barfield says, adding that the amount collected by the four rescue organisations (OzHarvest, Fareshare, SecondBite and Foodbank) totals 44,500 tonnes a year.
That useable waste also comes at a huge financial cost to the producers. It has a retail value of $3.7bn a year.
“We grow all this food that we are not going to eat. Globally, it is 1.3tn kg of food every year that no one eats and a quarter of the water goes to grow that. Then we dump it into landfill and poison ourselves with methane.
“We are not very bright.”
Barfield launched Yume in Melbourne last March and says it is the world's first surplus food marketplace selling to commercial businesses and operating at this scale.
Already it has moved nearly $500,000 worth of discounted product and, this week, Yume announced the completion of a $2.6m funding round which will help grow the enterprise.
New investors include the Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation, the Myer Foundation, the English Family Foundation and other high-net-worth investors.
Yume operates in Victoria and is about to expand to New South Wales and Queensland. Barfield says the business is expected to break even by mid-2018 and they intend to support conservation projects with their profits when they eventuate.

Anthony Wollstein, the national business development manager of the poultry supplier M&J Chickens, says their company uses Yume.
While they say M&J Chickens does not get a lot of excess stock, there are costs to selling it through its own channels. “It takes time in marketing it and contacting multiple clients,” they say. “And, at the same time, you don't always get the payoff for the work you put into it.
“We want to move stock quickly. If it is excess stock, it is because it is short-dated and we only have a small window to move it. We don't want to go dumping product.”
The executive chef at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, Peter Haycroft, says they look at Yume once a week when they are planning their menu for the centre's staff restaurants that feed 150 to 250 employees a day.
Haycroft says the savings offered by Yume are not what motivates them to use the site. “We like the story, we have a social conscience, the staff restaurants are a good vehicle for us to use. We get discounted product, but we are not charging our staff the full rate either. It is a good fit for us.”
Barfield, who is originally from the UK, has headed up three food rescue businesses, starting as chief executive of SecondBite, a charity that redistributes food from suppliers to the needy.
In 2012 Barfield started Spade & Barrow, a social enterprise to help farmers get a decent price for imperfect food by selling it to commercial kitchens. “We were basically a wholesaler for ugly food,” they say. About 30% of farmers' produce is thrown away just because of its appearance.
Spade & Barrow was sold to the online retailer Aussie Farmers Direct for “a small sum”, which helped fund the establishment of Yume (which cost $500,000).
Barfield says they inherited their passion for rescuing food from their father, who sold fruit “seconds” to the restaurants and hotels around Cambridge and London. “He would go out to the markets and buy the curved cucumbers … the curly products that were cheaper in the market,” they say.
The pieces fell into place for them when they opened a jazz bar in Melbourne and watched the chef ditch unused produce.
Barfield says they are constantly amazed at the produce that lands on their platform now: “Lobster tails …I cannot believe there is such a thing as surplus lobster tails – but there they are.
“There are also huge wheels of brie made by a Victorian artisan cheese maker. They were not fit for sale because they were not perfect rounds. It beggars belief.”
Anyone familiar with Brooklyn-based rapper Killah Priest knows their propensity for mixing urban culture with historical topics such as Alexander the Great and the Byzantines. For example, they start one of their more famous verses by yelling, “It's the Byzantine king!” The man literally has a line about watching the History and Discovery channels.
One historical figure that appears often in their songs is Hannibal Barca (c. 247-183 BC), the Carthaginian general that wreaked havoc on the Italian Peninsula for more than a decade, dealing the Roman Republic some of its most crushing defeats.
Stories of Hannibal crossing the Alps with elephants has become lore over the past 2,300 years, and Killah Priest embraces these depictions.
In “Color of Murder” (2009), one of their greatest songs, they warn the listener they will
Invade your block wit elephants comin'
Like Hannibal comin' from Carthage
But it's more like the Priest comin' from their projects
On a rare mixtape track, “Abyssinian Sword,” they start the whole song with
I sit back watching Discovery Channel on Hannibal
Wondering if their sword and elephant is intangible
This is one of their more aggressive, fast-paced raps full of hostile insults and physical violence. Appropriately, the image of Hannibal and their elephants kicks off the whole thing.
On the track “The God Within” from their 2009 Elizabeth album, Killah Priest briefly mentions Hannibal as one of their many tools for creating imagery.
I gave y'all parables, incomparable, unimaginable
Hannibal upon an animal, the Mazateen, the Manateniam
Millennium, equilibrium, it's equal to lithium
Ether, either I'm eager to show you I'm deeper than any of them
Their awe of Hannibal is clear, lumping the image of the Carthaginian on an elephant with other scenes they describe as “incomparable” and “unimaginable.”
Killah Priest's most recent evocation of Hannibal is on the track “Alien Stars” from their 2015 Planet of the Gods album. Here, they mix Hannibal with a slew of random imagery in a song where Killah Priest claims their “first nation was called the imagination.”
The land of cannibal, they have mistaken me as an animal
Now mistake me as Hannibal
Thousands of elephants impaled on the fence of Heaven
This mountain shaken the gates, I'll be a legend
They turned around, screaming "victory" to their brethren
Which turned into skeletons in seconds, they turned back
Their flesh also melted in the face of the army presence
No weapon is formed
By placing Hannibal in between "cannibal" and "elephants," there is a clear transition from the more popular use of the name with the fictitious Hannibal Lecter to the historical Hannibal Barca.
Killah Priest's use of Hannibal for such imagery is refreshing and dates back to the Romans, who were also enamored with the Carthaginian. Given that the destruction of Carthage left us with no Carthaginian history, our only knowledge of Hannibal comes directly from the Romans. They played up their military prowess for a variety of reasons, but not least because they needed a worthy enemy to defeat.
Killah Priest keeps this tradition of the Romans alive several thousand years later.
Notes
Lot of news flying around about the release of WordPress 2.7, featuring new Administration Panel interface to make WordPress more usable and accessible. Significant features and redesigns was added to WordPress 2.7 to make blogging on the new Dashboard Panel more valuable than ever.
You may find your Themes no longer work the way you are used to. It could be that they might be broken, because something in WordPress that was fundamental to them changed, but it's also possible that you can get them working again by updating some settings, or maybe just a small edit.
This post will highlight WordPress 2.7 HOW-TO get your theme working again by updating some settings and represent some of the best and significant features added to your Administration Panel.
So let's get started and don't forget to subscribe to our RSS-Feed and visit my twitter page : nourayehia if you want to follow to keep track on our next post.
1. Enhancing your WordPress 2.7 Theme
1.1. Enhancing Comment Display – Threading, Paging, etc.
WordPress 2.7 includes a lot of new enhancements, but one of the big ones is the new comment functionality. Comments can be threaded, paged, etc. Making your theme's comments compatible with WordPress 2.7 should be your first step when you edit your theme files. Otto has written a detailed post on the new comment enhancements in WordPress 2.7.
For details on how to update your theme to take advantage of these new features, please see the Enhanced Comment Display article.
1.2. Make this post sticky
Previously we had to use a plug-in to place a post at the top of the front page for posts and keep it there after new posts are made. With WordPress 2.7 you are now able to do this by just selecting a check box in your admin area > Edit Post > Publish panel > Visibility: Public and click edit.
1.3. Post Classes
Previously we used the code below to wrap a div around each post with a class=â€œpostâ€?
<div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" class="post">
With WordPress 2.7 a new function for post classes is included, which will help theme authors perform simple styling and formating for the post area.
<div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>
The new function is post_class(), where you will be able to to add your own classes as well.
<div id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class('style'); ?>>
The output of this function is
<div class="post sticky hentry category-icons style" id="post-5966">
This will add a number of classes to the div: post, category-slug, tag-slug, class â€™stickyâ€™ (if this post was marked as sticky from the admin area as mentioned in the previous point) and your specified class name.
1.4. wp page menu
Template Tag wp_page_menu acts as a wrapper for wp_list_pages, displays a list of WordPress Pages as links and support for Home page.
Because wp_page_menu() acts as a wrapper for wp_list_pages(), all of the wp_list_pages() parameters can be used with this Template Tag.
The following example causes “Home” to be added to the beginning of the list of Pages displayed. In addition, the Pages wrapped in a div element, listed under the title, “Page Menu”, and Page IDs 5, 9, and 23, are excluded from the list of Pages displayed.
<?php wp_page_menu('show_home=1&exclude=5,9,23&menu_class=page-navi&title_li=<h2>' . __('Page Menu') . '</h2>'); ?>
The output is something like this, where you will be able to have a complete control on styling the menu item and styling the menu item of the current page
<div class="page-navi"><ul><li><a href="https://www.noupe.com">Home</a></li><li class="page_item page-item-10 current_page_item"><a title="About Noupe" href="https://www.noupe.com/about">About Noupe</a></li><li class="page_item page-item-43"><a title="Advertise" href="https://www.noupe.com/advertise">Advertise</a></li><li class="page_item page-item-1374"><a title="Noupe Archive" href="https://www.noupe.com/archive">Noupe Archive</a></li></ul></div>
When you check the HTML output you will see â€œcurrent_page_itemâ€? class name added to current menu item.
1.5. Logout Link
wp_logout_url is a new template function for WordPress 2.7, this will redirect the user who has logged out back to the page where the link was clicked.
<a href="<?php echo wp_logout_url(); ?>">Logout</a>
2. New Admin Area Features
2.1. Keyboard Shortcuts for browsing and moderating comments
the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to browse and moderate comments was introduced. These keyboard shortcuts are designed to save time by allowing you to rapidly navigate and perform actions on comments.
Keyboard shortcuts are enabled by visiting the Profile panel in Administration > Users > Your Profile. Check the Keyboard Shortcuts checkbox to enable keyboard shortcuts for comment moderation.
Pressing j moves the current selection (light-blue background) down.
Pressing k moves the current selection (light-blue background) up.
Pressing a approvals the currently selected comment.
Pressing s marks the current comment as spam.
Pressing d deletes the current comment.
Pressing u unapproves the currently selected comment, placing it back into moderation.

2.4. Allow plugin installations via web interface from Admin Area
The plugin installer allows for installing plugins from the WordPress Administration panels. You can search for plugins by tag, plugin author, or by subject.
It also lists the featured, most popular, and recently added and updated. When you click on the title of a plugin, you can see the details and choose to install it into your WordPress plugin list.
2.5. Admin's new Navigation Menu
One of the best features of the new WP 2.7 feature is moving the top navigation to a side navigation. The side navigation will allow users to expand and collapse sections to reveal the submenus without loading a new screen. In addition, the entire navigation column is collapsible, with a remnant of icons providing an “advanced” mode that creates the largest possible working area.
2.6. Interesting Dashboard Modules: QuickPress & Recent Drafts
A fast way to create drafts or posts that don't require the full metadata options of the Add New Post screen is using the QuickPress module found on the Dasboard area. You you will be able to moderate new comments directly from the Dashboard, including the new Reply to Comment function.
2.7. Quick Edit Option in Admin area
For details on how to update your theme to take advantage of these new features, please see the Enhanced Comment Display article.
2.8. Auto Close Comments And Trackbacks
Comments and trackbacks are deactivated after a certain time.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., may be fond of former President Barack Obama, but he's still disappointed with their upcoming speaking engagement at a top investment firm on Wall Street.
Sanders, a fierce Wall Street critic, described Obama as a friend and said they represented the United States with intelligence and integrity. But they also said they wish the Democratic leader had passed on the $400,000 offer to speak at Cantor Fitzgerald's health care conference in September.
“I think at a time when people are so frustrated with the power of Wall Street and the big money interests, I think it is unfortunate that President Obama is doing this,” Sanders told “CBS This Morning” on Friday.
Obama spokesperson Eric Schultz defended the paid speech. Schultz argued that the former president wanted to discuss health care reform and that they also accepted an unprecedented amount of campaign money from Wall Street while still passing legislation to rein in the industry.

During their CBS interview, Sanders pointed to former Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn becoming President Trump's top economic adviser as just one example of the financial sector's influence over Washington.
“Wall Street has incredible power, and I would've hoped that the president would not have given a speech like that,” Sanders continued.
Host Gayle King asked Sanders whether they would turn down a $400,000 payout to give a speech. Sanders did not categorically reject the prospect of accepting such a large fee for a speech, but they said they most certainly would if the money came from Wall Street.
“If Wall Street offered me that, yeah,” Sanders said. “But I must tell you, I really don't have to worry about that too much. I haven't gotten too many invitations from Wall Street.”
Sanders made similar comments to Bloomberg on Thursday. They bemoaned the influence of “big money in the political process” but noted that Obama is now a private citizen and can do whatever they want.
While promoting their new book on SiriusXM's “Radio Andy” Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., also expressed concern about Obama's decision to accept the speaking fee.
“Well, I was troubled by that,” Warren said. “One of the things I talk about in the book is the influence of money — I describe it as a snake that slithers through Washington — and that it shows up in so many different ways here in Washington.”
Sanders' distrust of politicians receiving what they consider exorbitant paychecks for speaking to major investment banks is well known. They relentlessly criticized former rival Hillary Clinton for their speeches to Goldman Sachs — arguing that Wall Street had curried favor with their opponent — when they were vying for the Democratic Party's nomination last year.

One of the top pass rushers on the West Coast has announced their commitment and it's great news for Husky fans. 3-star OLB Ariel Ngata (6'4", 215 lbs.) out of Folsom (Calif.) High School has given their pledge to the Dawgs.
A little earlier than expected but proud to announce that I have COMITTED to the UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON #GoDawgs pic.twitter.com/ib0pOZMKnM — Ariel Ngata (@IAMNGATA) May 26, 2016
The Huskies have been among Ngata's top schools for awhile now and were the first school to extend an offer to him, back in November. Ariel says they started following the Huskies last summer at the encouragement of their head coach, who gave Chris Petersen and linebacker coach Bob Gregory their stamp of approval. A visit to Montlake in late February solidified UW's position and Ngata outright named them their leader in March. Ariel said they were sold on Petersen's Built For Life message and was blown away by Washington's facilities.
Ngata will come to Seattle from Folsom High School, the same program that produced Jake Browning. Washington was able to beat out Arizona, Utah, Washington State, BYU, Oregon, Oregon State, and Colorado among others.
Ariel plays both outside linebacker and defensive end for Folsom which should allow them to make a smooth transition to UW as they say they are being recruited as a hybrid, stand up pass rusher, Buck-type player. They had an impressive junior season in 2015, racking up 80 total tackles and 4 sacks.

Edit: Drafted 34th Overall by the Montreal Canadiens.
Sweden's hockey program has really improved in recent years. The country is producing more and more quality NHL prospects every year. For the 2013 class, Jacob de la Rose joins Elias Lindholm, Andre Burakowsky, Robert Hagg, and Alexander Wennberg to give us 5 Swedes in the top 34 ranked players at LWOS.
De la Rose spent the season playing for Leksands in the Swedish Allsvenskan, the second division of Swedish men's hockey. As we've explained previously, the Allsvenskan is not like the AHL, the leagues are set up like European Football (Soccer) leagues with relegation and promotion. De la Rose played a bottom line role for Leksands as a 17 year old playing against men, but they did help Leksands earn promotion to the Elitserien for next season.
De la Rose has a ton of international experience and has been playing for Swedish national teams at the Under 16, Under 17, Under 18, and Under 20 levels over the years. They have won silver medals at the 2012 IIHF World Under 18 Championships, and at the 2013 World Junior Championships. They were also the Swedish captain at the 2013 Under 18s.
Center/Wing
Born May 20 1995 — Arvika, Sweden
Height 6.02 — Weight 183 — Shoots Left
De la Rose is a dynamic skater. They have great speed, and excellent acceleration.  They are very explosive and their ability to change speeds, and that extra gear they have allows them to beat defenders to the outside and cut to the net. He's also quick at getting in on the forecheck, and de la Rose takes advantage of this as they just loves to hit. They have good agility and edgework allowing them to navigate their way through traffic, and their great balance allows them to fight through checks.
There are a lot of tools in de la Rose's toolbox in the offensive zone. They have great stickhandling and very soft hands. They go to the net and can score goals in tight on rebounds and tip ins. They also have a good wrist soft, and their release is decent. He's an absolute beast on the boards and just loves physical contact, often being the initiator. De la Rose has shown good vision and passing skills on occasion as well. There is a huge “But” here though, and It's that despite showing flashes of all these tools, de la Rose has not been as productive as they could be. Their Allvenskan stats are good for a 17 year old in that league, and I don't take issue with those, but at the international level, de la Rose is just not putting up the points you'd expect given their talent, at the U18 and WJC levels.
De la Rose's defensive game is excellent, especially for a player their age.  They are an extremely responsible forward, who has great gap control and understands how to always keep themselves between their man and the net. They backchecks hard, and comes down low to help their defencemen against the cycle game. De la Rose is a willing shot blocker and cuts down the passing lanes, anticipating plays well and creating turnovers. They continue to play their rough and tumble game in the defensive end and again loves to take the body. Their defensive game is elite given the stage they are at in their development.
De la Rose's style is reminiscent of David Backes of the St. Louis Blues, perhaps even with better skating. However this is a style comparison and not an assessment of potential. De la Rose could become a top 6 forward if they can develop their offensive tools and show consistent production. However, they are a player who is a very safe player as with their size, physicality, defensive prowess, and skating ability, he's a very good bet to be a valuable third/fourth line NHLer even if the offence does not come around.
Don't forget to check back tomorrow where we will reveal the number 35 prospect for this June's NHL Draft.

Footage released by authorities in Tulsa, Okla. captures the moments before and after an unarmed black man was fatally shot by an officer earlier this week.
ADVERTISEMENT
The video, from an unidentified officer's body camera at the scene, starts just before Eric Harris was shot during the April 2 incident.
Harris was purportedly killed by Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, who mistakenly fired their weapon instead of a taser, according to reports.
“I shot him, I'm sorry,” a voice says in the recording after a single shot rings out.
The clip then shows Harris screaming in pain as officers surround him. Police had chased Harris on foot after they allegedly fled arrest for selling a 9mm semiautomatic pistol and ammunition to undercover cops.
“He shot me!” Harris exclaims. “He shot me, man.”
“Oh my God,” they continue. “I'm losing my breath.”
Harris was pronounced dead an hour after they were shot. The recording shows no medical aid performed by police officers on the scene.
“F--k your breath,” one officer says while holding Harris down by the neck. “Shut the f--k up.”
NBC's local affiliate reported Friday that the Tulsa County Sherriff's Office said Harris showed “characteristics consistent with carrying a gun” during the skirmish.
The sheriff's office added that Bates “did not commit a crime” by accidentally firing on Harris.
Conventional wisdom is wrong again. There is not one big populist revolt now sweeping across America. Rather, there are three revolts –– one from the right, one from the left and one from angry voters across the board.
The first revolt has been percolating for nearly a decade. It is an insurgency targeted against moral compromise and it is being waged within –– and, in some ways, against –– the Republican Party. Powered at the grass roots by the Tea Party and on Capitol Hill by the Freedom Caucus, this movement has pulled the Republican Party well to the right of where it was just a few years ago.
These conservative ideologues are tired of GOP candidates who don't deliver on campaign promises, especially cutting government. They loathe moderate Republicans who make deals with Democrats, and they view legislative bargaining as betrayal. They see Barack Obama's Washington as a foreign capital, much like Moscow or Beijing. Shutting down government is not just a tactic they use to get what they want –– it is what they want.
Going into this election, multiple GOP presidential candidates sought to harness this rebellion, but the one who has emerged as its champion, at least for now, is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. In the Iowa caucuses, for example, Cruz beat Donald Trump by more than a 2-to-1 margin among “very conservative” voters, while Trump beat Cruz by nearly 4-to-1 among moderates.
The second revolt is aimed at wealth inequality and corporate corruption. This revolt operates mostly within the Democratic Party, although many disaffected independents — especially younger voters –– find the cause appealing.
While anti-corporate progressives regularly vote for Democrats, they have become frustrated with party leaders who take money from Wall Street billionaires and then shy away from politically risky causes such as redistributing wealth and breaking up big banks. They're animated by their hatred of big money in politics –– especially money spent by rich conservatives such as the Koch brothers. (Their concern about the millions spent by labor unions is more muted.)
These ideological insurgents have pulled the Democratic Party far to the left of where it was when Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992, and even to the left of where it was when Obama won just eight years ago. To illustrate this shift: A recent national poll found that more Democrats now favor socialism than capitalism.
Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has championed this revolt, which is why many Democrats pushed them to run for president. But when they passed on entering the race against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton –– a move they may now regret –– Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders picked up the mantle and has since carried it with unexpected success.
The third revolt is one directed at the political system itself.
While both the left and right share a growing contempt for politics as usual, the impetus for this popular uprising comes mostly from center-right voters upset by government paralysis and incompetence. It is a movement built upon cynicism –– and anger at dodgy politicians, broken institutions and increasing demands for political correctness. No longer content to just tweak the system, they want to knock it down.
Enter the bulldozer, Donald Trump. In their own inimitable way, the New York real estate developer has loosely become the champion of this third revolt. Recent polls have found that a majority of Republicans view Trump as the one presidential candidate most able to bring needed change to Washington. Whether he's ultimately successful or not in their first electoral quest, they give millions of voters what they crave: a nonpolitician who shares their anger and speaks their language.
But unlike the leaders of other change movements, Trump offers himself, and not a laundry list of reform proposals, as the solution. By doing so, he's asking for a blank check to do whatever they want as president, and that –– along with their eyebrow-raising bombast and tough positions on immigration and trade –– scares the hell out of traditional reformers.
In distinct ways, each of these movements reflects the loss of public confidence in our political system and, more fundamentally, the eroding legitimacy of American democracy.
When history writes its chapter on the 2016 election, it will record how three revolts roiled our politics. In truth, this may not be the winter of our discontent; it may be the start of something that lasts much longer.
The Herald Sun has been caught red-handed trying to entrap Victorian MPs in an unethical and possibly illegal sting operation just days before the state election.
FBI Director James Comey is once again shaking Washington to its core.
Comey, a pivotal character in the 2016 election who many Democrats say cost their party the White House, confirmed Monday that the FBI is investigating possible links between Russia and President Trump's campaign.
“I can promise you we will follow the facts wherever they lead,” Comey vowed in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, which is also looking into Russia's meddling in the presidential election.
The announcement ensures that Comey and the FBI will hover over the administration for as long the investigation takes, frustrating Republicans who would like to move on from the controversies surrounding Trump and Moscow.

The FBI director gave few details about the Russia probe, leaving it unclear just who is under investigation. Just as unclear is how long the investigation will take.
What is certain is that the probe is unwelcome news for the White House and the GOP.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who served on Trump's transition team, described it as “a big gray cloud” over the Trump White House.
After the hearing, they expressed frustration with Comey, who dodged questions about whom exactly the investigation might cover.
“I think this is very problematic moving forward — that you can't even say whether or not people in the White House or the administration are under some kind of investigation. I think that's very problematic,” Nunes said.
Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio) appeared to argue that Comey was hurting the political system with their decision.
They said the Russian government wanted to “put a cloud over our system” with its actions during the presidential campaign.
“Mr. Comey, your announcement today — there is now a cloud that undermines our system,” Turner said.
Monday's dramatic developments are nothing new for Comey, who seems to thrive on drama.
While serving as deputy attorney general under former President George W. Bush, Comey once visited then-Attorney General John Ashcroft's hospital bed to counsel them against signing papers reauthorizing a domestic surveillance program the Justice Department had determined was illegal.
The Ashcroft episode helped foster a narrative about Comey, who was said to be a public servant determinedly guarding the Department of Justice's reputation.
But as Comey's investigation of Clinton played out in the 2016 race, Democrats saw something different: a lifetime Republican unnecessarily meddling in an election.
In July, Comey announced the FBI would recommend no charges against Clinton for their use of a private email server as secretary of State.
Comey also did damage to Clinton, however, by blasting the Democrat for being “extremely careless.”
It was to get worse for Clinton.
Just over a week before Election Day, Comey announced the FBI was looking into new emails in connection with its investigation of the private server.
Comey eventually announced just days before Election Day that the FBI had found nothing to change its earlier determination. But that was little solace to the Clinton campaign, which believes Comey's decision cost Clinton the White House.
The Clinton campaign in a call to donors two days after Election Day argued that Comey's letter announcing the continued investigation pushed voters in swing states away from Clinton.
Clinton officials were also angry that Comey and the FBI did not investigate Russia's meddling in the presidential election to the degree to which they looked into whether Clinton transferred classified information through their private server.
“Comparing the FBI's massive response to the overblown email scandal with the seemingly lackadaisical response to the very real Russian plot to subvert a national election shows that something is deeply broken at the FBI,” Clinton campaign chief John Podesta wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post.
Comey has irritated members of both parties at different times over the last year.
Republicans howled when they did not recommend charges against Clinton, though Trump supporters cheered when they announced the FBI was looking into the new emails in November.
Comey's latest revelation again puts them at odds with the GOP. It could separately inflame Trump's feud with the intelligence community given leaked reports about contacts between their aides and Russian officials, which prompted the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn last month.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said there was no proof of collusion, citing previous statements by former acting CIA chief Michael Morrell and James Clapper, the director of national intelligence under the Obama administration.
“Investigating it and having proof are two different things,” Spicer said. “There's a point at which you continue to search for something that everybody who's been briefed hasn't seen or found.”
There were questions after Trump's election about whether they would keep Comey as FBI director.
They decided to do so, and even embraced Comey at a Jan. 22 White House event during which they praised the FBI director.
Spicer said Monday that there is no reason to believe Trump doesn't have complete confidence in Comey — for now.

Which is worse: Grabbing a man's arm or grabbing a woman's ass?
By Carolyn Yeager
Attack ‘victim' Elie Wiesel attacks 19 year old girl and runs away
Elie Wiesel has been accused by a Jewish mother of four, married, a Ph.D from New York University of having squeezed their buttock when they were a vulnerable 19-year-old attending a Jewish charity dinner with their boyfriend's family. Wiesel, of course, died last year and it's doubtful their family will comment on the charge.
What it brings to mind for me is this: Elie Wiesel fully cooperated in the prosecution of a 22 year old male, the at-the-time completely unknown Eric Hunt, for grabbing their arm in a hotel elevator in 2007. And now it comes out that Wiesel is also a perpetrator: guilty of surreptitiously grabbing a young woman's buttocks at a Jewish charity dinner in 1989.
In 1989, Wiesel was 61 years old and it had been only three years since they won the Nobel Prize for Peace in Oslo. They were at the height of their fame.
I believed Jenny Listman's story right away because radio personality Deanna Spingola had told me of their experience meeting Elie Wiesel after a speech they gave as a “Holocaust survivor.” I do not recall where or when this took place, but Deanna claims they went up, along with other audience members, to meet the famous survivor after their speech. As I remember them telling it, they fixed their gaze on them with suddenly aroused interest, and whatever physical contact took place, whether handshake or something more, they held on to them longer than they felt was appropriate. They also engaged in chatty conversation, asking them about herself. Deanna, at the time an attractive single working woman, blonde and blue eyed, felt the unmistakable sexual vibes emanating from Mr. Wiesel toward them I suppose if they had told them where they would be after the event (in the hotel bar for instance) they would have found a way to show up there. The impression Deanna had then, at a time they were still a believer in the holocaust narrative, never changed: that he's a womanizer.
I never doubted Deanna's account; I hope they will come forward and describe this experience in their own words, for the record. I am not the only person they told this to.
Now, hearing Jenny Listman's story is confirmation for me that Wiesel was just another run-of-the-mill sexual predator from New York City, a breeding ground of such types.
Listman, describing themselves as a non-observant Jew, writes about what happened to them in exquisite detail on their own blog page dated Oct. 19, 2017, as part of the #metoo Twitter campaign following the accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. They define themselves as a PhD, married mother of 4, New Yorker; data science, data visualization specialist. They begin their long post with a quote from Elie Wiesel's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 1986:
“I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation . We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor , never the tormented.”
Listman explains the event as follows: They were participating in a group photo of their boyfriend's family with guest speaker Elie Wiesel following a dinner given by the Jewish charity to honor their deceased father and husband. Wiesel suddenly said “Wait,” untangled themselves from their place in the center of the group, darted in between Listman and their boyfriend at the far end, and then said, “Ok” to the photographer. Listman felt their hand on their shoulder inch down their back until, at the moment the photographer snapped the picture, Wiesel's hand “squeezed their right ass cheek” and Wiesel “RAN, disappearing into the crowd of over 1000 people.”
When they told their boyfriend what had just happened, they responded with disbelief. Maybe they were mistaken, they suggested, or imagined it. No, they said, they were sure. But they didn't push the matter any further. They knew it would just upset everyone. And so did Elie Wiesel know that.
The boyfriend, whom they later married and divorced, confirmed this conversation took place, according to Linley Sanders at Newsweek.
Remember that Wiesel's speaking fee was $25,000 plus chauffeur-driven limousine to and from. Per talk. They were probably not friends of the man being honored, or their family, but was hired by the charity. (That is where so much of your charity money goes – something to keep in mind.) This explains why they were looking to entertain themselves while doing a boring job for pay.
Reaction to this revelation
Reaction from the Jews is to downplay, disbelieve or deny. Non-Jews are staying away from the whole story – too hot to handle. They might say the wrong thing and never recover from it.
Commentary, a Jewish publication ran a dismissive article by Daniella Greenbaum the next day, Oct. 20, in which Greenbaum said they didn't believe Listman's account, and made them out to be mentally unstable.
The Forward Jewish news organization ran Listman's accusations when they appeared, but then published a sort of apology/retraction two days later, saying the story “did not meet our journalistic standards and has been removed.”
The far-left Salon website posted the story, concluding that (in my words) there are not just ‘holocaust survivors,' but there are ‘sex abuse survivors' too, and we must listen to all of them and sort it out as best we can.
The best coverage of all is what you find right here on Elie Wiesel Cons The World.
Elie Wiesel condemns others but cannot admit their own human failings
To return to Wiesel and Eric Hunt, I think it is the most important moral of the story. Wiesel for many, many years accepted being portrayed as a paragon of blameless virtue and, in turn, portrayed all “holocaust survivors” as blameless victims of totally evil Germans. They were a proponent of the Jewish idea of “Never Forgive, Never Forget” and their infamous sentiment, “Every Jew must set aside in their heart a special place of hate for the German and what the German represents.”
When young Eric Hunt tugged on their arm in a San Francisco hotel demanding to speak to them privately, then let go, turned and walked away when Wiesel began yelling for help, Wiesel called the police and was okay with having Hunt charged with attempted kidnapping, false imprisonment, elder abuse, stalking, battery and the commission of a hate crime – which would have confined the youth to prison for possibly the rest of their life. Wiesel said they were very frightened, which was clearly an unforgivable thing to do to him.
Wiesel then testified at Hunt's trial, during which they lied under oath about their purported Auschwitz tattoo and their book Night–no big deal to the blithe and breezy icon who can ‘run away' from their own unlawful actions. Luckily for Hunt, their age and prior clean record allowed the counts against them to be cut to misdemeanor battery and misdemeanor elder abuse to which they had to plead guilty in order to be let off with time served and probation. A Man of Compassion, Wiesel is not.
How will the Wiesel admirers react to their icon's sexual abuse of a teenager? Will there be more “#metoo's” showing up in the near future? I'm sure there are more, but whether they have the will or desire to speak out is uncertain, especially as the majority are probably Jewish. I believe the Jewish power structure will crack down hard on any and all disloyalists. But we will keep watching and reporting it if more develops in this fascinating and unexpected saga.

The UK telecoms regulator, Ofcom, has published its first annual report to the European Commission on their monitoring of the EU's new rules for protecting Net Neutrality (open internet access). The report finds that “there are no major concerns regarding the openness of the internet in the UK.”
Last year the EU introduced new regulation to protect the open internet from abuse (here), which essentially means that broadband ISPs and Mobile Network Operators cannot impose excessive restrictions against Internet traffic (e.g. no serious blocking or slowing of access to legal websites or Internet services). However there are some exceptions to this, such as for general Traffic Management and security reasons etc.
The rules are applied via a self-regulatory approach in the United Kingdom, which is governed by the Broadband Stakeholder Group and their 2016 Open Internet Code. This code commits signatory ISPs to neutrality and transparency in traffic management on their networks (details).
Ofcom's first report is fairly short and that's because the regulator only found a few contentious packages or offers from Mobile operators, which might have fallen outside of the rules, although these were too brief or small to have any real impact. For example, in November 2016 an unnamed Mobile operator launched a 4G product including zero-rated use of certain messaging services but the offer was limited and the operator itself was tiny.
However, Ofcom did identify “some areas where internet providers should improve their compliance with the Regulation,” not least in terms of the rule that says “end-users have the right to use terminal equipment of their choice.” By terminal equipment they mean devices like broadband routers etc.
Ofcom's Statement on End-User Terminal Equipment Article 3 (1) establishes the rights of end users to access the internet using the “terminal equipment of their choice”. During the first year of operation of the Regulation we identified a practice of concern through our own engagement with ISPs and independent monitoring. We have opened an initial enquiry into the matter. The purpose of an enquiry is to determine whether there is a case to answer, and if there is, whether it would be consistent with Ofcom's administrative priorities to carry out a formal investigation. If we decide to investigate, we will, in accordance with our normal process, publish the details on our website.
We did wonder whether this one might crop up. Ofcom doesn't name the ISP, although as an example we know of several providers that make it difficult for their broadband subscribers to use a third-party router (e.g. Sky Broadband), such as by withholding the customer's password. Such limitations can often be circumvented (Google and Wireshark are your friends) but it's still an annoyance.
At this stage Ofcom isn't giving too much away about the who, what, when or where of their initial enquiry but we'll keep an eye on it and report back if anything interesting happens.
Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury enters the last year of their contract facing an uncertain future, which might not involve Pittsburgh.
"I'm not in a hurry to do a contract with him," Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford told the Tribune-Review Monday.
Since signing a seven-year, $35-million contract in 2008, and winning the Stanley Cup in 2009, Fleury faced ample criticism for their inconsistent play in goal.
However, their save percentage was actually slightly better last season than during Pittsburgh's Cup-winning campaign, as was Fleury's regular season record (39-18).
Agent Alan Walsh said the decision to refrain from an extension is what both sides want with Fleury set to become a free agent next summer.
"We're actually on the same page. It's of no consequence at all," Walsh said.
Although it may seem like Rutherford is ready to let Fleury walk, they also said they are "one of the most talented goalies in the league" and believes they will be around for the long haul.
"From my point of view, he's our goalie. There's no reason why they can't be our goalie for a long time," Rutherford said. "I told them to keep doing this summer whatever they did last summer. They had a really good year."
Rutherford, appointed general manager in June, is certainly looking at the bigger picture, choosing to wait and see what Fleury has left in the tank before the organization makes another long-term commitment.

Judges have ruled that Cleveland police acted unlawfully when they monitored journalists' phones in an attempt to uncover the source of a series of leaks.
The police force used powers under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to seize records of calls totalling more than 1m minutes from three journalists, a solicitor and two police officers after details of internal grievances appeared in the Northern Echo in 2012.
Having initially maintained that the data collection was justified, this month the force apologised for its actions after hearing evidence given to an investigatory power tribunal late last year.
The judgment handed down by the tribunal on Tuesday morning says there was “no lawful basis” for accessing the records and that the amount of data obtained from the targets' phones was excessive.
Ripa can be used to check data from phones and other devices to discover evidence of crimes where there is a reasonable chance of prosecution. The tribunal judges decided the decision to access the records was based on a “subjective belief” and that targeting the journalists and a solicitor was always unlikely to be justified.

The application for phone data was made in part to uncover the identity of a whistleblower who passed the Northern Echo an internal report that had uncovered elements of institutional racism in the force. The paper ran the story on its front page in 2012.
Tuesday's judgment says police should have considered that their actions were an infringement of the right to freedom of speech when they accessed data from the personal and work phones of reporters at the paper.
Cleveland's chief constable, Iain Spittal, who joined the force after the phones were targeted, said: “Although I have already contacted the people affected by this and said sorry, sorry on its own isn't enough. Because of this the police and crime commissioner and I announced earlier this year an expert review of the professional standards department and all Ripa use over the past six years.
“I am proud to lead Cleveland police. I am confident that those who work with me will continue to strive to be the best that they can be each and every day. When we get things wrong, as we did here, we will say sorry and work to make things right.”
The judgment has been sent to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Thomas Winsor, for their consideration.
Andy Richardson, the editor of the Northern Echo, told the journalism trade website Hold the Front Page that they were delighted to see the law come down on the side of reporters who were trying to expose matters of public interest “rather than police officers who were attempting to stifle the truth”.
They said: “This is a victory for the free press. I hope it reminds the public that having strong local newspapers is a vital part of the democratic process. We need your continued support. I also hope it reminds newspaper owners how important it is for them to give editors sufficient resources to undertake major, long-running investigations.
“Like many local papers, the Northern Echo has a proud tradition of exposing wrongdoing and corruption. Life would be so much easier for police forces, politicians and dodgy business people if investigative reporting simply withered and died. We cannot allow that to happen. This case shows that having teams of experienced reporters unearthing stories in their local communities is a valuable in 2017 as it was in 1870 when the Echo was founded.”
One of the most vivid predictions of global warming theory is a “hotspot” in the tropical upper troposphere, where increased tropical convection responding to warming sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is supposed to cause enhanced warming in the upper troposphere.
The trouble is that radiosonde (weather ballons) and satellites have failed to show evidence of a hotspot forming in recent decades. Instead, upper tropospheric warming approximately the same as surface warming has been observed.
It has been also been pointed out, with some justification, that our lower tropospheric temperature product really can't be used to find the hotspot since it peaks too low in the troposphere, and our mid-troposphere product might have too much contamination from cooling in the lower stratosphere to detect the hotspot.
A recent paper by Sherwood and Nishant in Environmental Research letters presented a reanalysis of the radiosonde data and claims to find evidence of the hotspot. I've looked through the paper and find the statistical black box approach they used to be unconvincing. I'll leave it to others to examine the details of their statistical adjustments, what what the physical reasons for those adjustments might be.
Instead, I want to introduce you to a new product that is made possible by the new methods we now use in Version 6 of our UAH datasets (links at the bottom).
Since we now have a tropopause (“TP”) product, we can combine that with our lower stratosphere (“LS”) product in such a way that we pretty well isolate the tropical upper tropospheric layer that is supposed to be warming the fastest.
The following plot of the satellite weighting functions shows that a simple linear combination of the TP and LS weighting functions (from MSU3/AMSU7 and MSU4/AMSU9, respectively) gives peak weight in the layer where the strongest warming is expected to occur, approximately 7-13 km in altitude:
If we apply the coefficients (1.4, -0.4) to the TP and LS products, the resulting “UT” (upper troposphere) product for the tropical oceans (20N-20S) produces monthly anomalies since 1979 as shown by the bright red line in the following plot (I have added offsets to all time series so their linear trend lines intersect zero at the beginning of 1979):
Note that the linear warming trend in the UT product (+0.07 C/decade, bright red trend line) is less than the HadSST3 sea surface temperature trend (light green, +0.10 C/decade) for the same 20N-20S latitude band, whereas theory would suggest it should be about twice as large (+0.20 C/decade).
And what is really striking in the above plot is how strong the climate models' average warming trend over the tropical oceans is in the upper troposphere (+0.35 C/decade, dark red), which I calculate to be about 1.89 times the models' average surface trend (+0.19 C/decade, dark green). This ratio of 1.89 is based upon the UT weighting function applied to the model average temperature trend profile from the surface to 100 mb (16 km) altitude.
So, what we see is that the models are off by about a factor of 2 on surface warming, but maybe by a factor of 5 (!) for upper tropospheric warming.
This is all preliminary, of course, since we still must submit our Version 6 paper for publication. So, make of it what you will.
But I am increasingly convinced that the hotspot really has gone missing. And the reason why (I still believe) is most likely related to water vapor feedback and precipitation processes, which largely govern the total heat budget of the free-troposphere (the layer above the turbulently mixed boundary layer).
I believe the missing hotspot is indirect evidence that upper tropospheric water vapor is not increasing, and so upper tropospheric water vapor (the most important layer for water vapor feedback) is not amplifying warming from increasing CO2. The fact that UT warming is indeed amplified — by about a factor of 2 — during El Nino events in the above plot might be related to the relatively short time scales involved, since convective heating and radiative cooling are far out of balance during short term variations, but are much closer to being balanced in the long-term with global warming.
The lack of positive water vapor feedback is an especially controversial assertion to make, given that (1) SSM/I satellite measurements of water vapor have indeed been increasing in lock-step with SST warming, and (2) probably a unanimous opinion in the IPCC climate community that water vapor feedback is positive.
But the SSM/I measurements are largely insensitive to the very low levels of upper tropospheric water vapor, so they can't tell us anything about upper tropospheric vapor. And while lower-tropospherc water vapor is governed mostly by SST, upper tropospheric vapor is governed by precipitation processes, and we don't even understand how those might change with warming, let alone have those physics included in climate models.
Instead, I suspect the models have been adjusted so that precipitation systems detrain more water vapor into the upper troposphere with warming, simply because that's what we see on short time scales, say during El Nino events, and so the convective parameterizations in the models are adjusted to meet that expectation.
As part of a DOE contract we have, we will be examining 183 GHz measurements of upper tropospheric vapor, but those are available only since 1991 from the DMSP satellites, and late 1998 from the NOAA satellites. And from what I've read, it might not be possible to get meaningful trends from those data. So, at this point it's not clear that we can get long term trends from water vapor…although there has been some tantalizing evidence of upper tropospheric drying since the 1950s in radiosonde data.
You can read more about the issues involved in determining water vapor feedback, and why I think it might not be amplyfing global warming, here.

After losing to the Bucks on Monday, the Bulls returned to the Advocate Center for practice on Tuesday. Here are four observations from Tuesday's session:
Kris Dunn In The Building: After missing Monday's game against the Bucks because of a migraine, Kris Dunn was at the Advocate Center and according to Jim Boylen they had improved. Despite not practicing the Bulls guard will travel on the two-game road trip starting in Memphis. They and Otto Porter Jr. (leg strain) are both listed as questionable against the Grizzles. Porter Jr. went through some court work, “batting practice is what we call it” said Boylen and they'll see how they respond to that.
The Flushing Finnisher: After working with Doug Collins and a couple Bulls assistants on their mid-range game, Lauri Markkanen wrapped up their workout with an impressive display of dunks. The sound of Zach LaVine throwing down turned heads as reporters were all listening to Robin Lopez speak after practice. LaVine and Markkanen were going back and forth, adding and upping the creativity of each dunk. It was quite entertaining. First and foremost the two-time Slam Dunk Contest champion definitely still has it and second, the slam Markkanen is working on with LaVine's expertise is going to be something else if they perfect it. Nonetheless, the duo is having fun, they're laughing, enjoying each other's company and most important, clicking during games.
Grumpy Bulls Big Man: The typically fun-loving, intriguing Robin Lopez was not real rosy chatting with media members Tuesday afternoon. Not that they were rude, just a little surly in comparison to their normal cheerful disposition. Maybe they were just looking forward to their nap on the plane ride to Memphis (which he's stated is a very critical part to their day) or maybe it's because a buyout for Lopez seems very unlikely at this point. In order for players to join another team for the playoffs, they need to be released by Friday.
Robin's response: “I haven't even been thinking about it. We've been having a lot of fun out on the court right now and I'm relishing it.”
Lopez did, however, crack a smile when asked about the sequence involving their brother in Monday's game against Milwaukee. The older Lopez knocked down a triple and had themselves their signature tea party only to be followed by a monster dunk from Brook Lopez on the other end. “Something must have put that fire in them to go get that dunk. I'm not sure what it was.”
On The Mend: Denzel Valentine was spotted on the bike upstairs at the Advocate Center. Chandler Hutchison, who visited the Bahamas over All-Star break, was seen running on the treadmill.
According to Boylen, “(Hutchison) is still a little ways away. He's working at it and they have progressed. Don't think I can give you a timeline, but there has been improvement and growth.”

ICYMI: Governor Greg Abbott: Forced Annexation Is Un-Texan AUSTIN - Governor Greg Abbott wrote an op-ed featured in the San Antonio Express-News yesterday that outlined their opposition to forced annexation in Texas. This issue is part of the Governor's special session call. Forced Annexation Is Un-Texan By Gov. Greg Abbott San Antonio Express-News Forced annexation by cities — without a vote by the impacted property owners — is piracy by government, a tyranny of taxation without representation that would have made old King George proud. Texas is still the envy of the nation. With our strong economy, overall lower costs of living and high quality of life, the Lone Star State remains the best place to raise a family, build a business and create greater opportunity for all. But liberty in Texas should not end at any city limits sign. While we rightly rail against overreach by the federal government, local municipalities are increasingly infringing on private property rights. Involuntary annexation is a practice that allows Texas municipalities to force property owners just outside of the city limits to become residents — whether they like it or not. The city can then impose new regulations and, worse, higher taxes. Those forcibly annexed property owners are made responsible for the city's already accumulated debt without having approved its issuance. This is legal. But very un-Texan. State law currently allows a city to annex up to 10 percent of its incorporated land from its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) every year. Advance notice must be provided to residents and businesses in the affected area, but consent is not needed. And though public hearings are sometimes hosted, forced annexation by cities provides no actionable outlet for those property owners to approve or disapprove by vote or petition, creating taxation without representation. Texas is one of a dwindling few states that still allow involuntary annexation without election or petition. Cities favor annexation as a means to quickly increase their tax base and generate additional revenue. Alternately, limited-purpose annexations allow a city to annex an area to expand hyper-regulations to its ETJ — through sometimes onerous planning, zoning, and health and safety ordinances — without imposing taxes but also without providing municipal services such as police protection. Property owners who prefer to live outside the city limits have already voted with their feet. That right can then be denied to them under the current flawed law. Testimony offered during the regular legislative session from residents in the San Antonio ETJ was disturbing. One small community of retirees fears substantial increases in taxes without any appreciable increase or improvement in services, creating a financial hardship for those who chose to live their retirement years outside of the city. To now use protection of our military installations as an argument against much-needed annexation reforms, as some opponents of reforms are doing, is inexcusable. The men and women in uniform who have trained and served on these bases have fought to protect our rights to liberty, some paying the ultimate price. Had sensible land-use protections for areas around our critical military bases been a priority, the city of San Antonio could have acted years ago. It's not just an issue in the Alamo City. Residents from across the state feel abused by the annexation process and voiced their concerns to legislators this past session. But they were outshouted by those representing the interests of the big cities. I urge the Texas Legislature to listen again. If cities want to expand their tax base, they can attract new businesses and residents by following the state's lead: Create a welcoming economic environment by lowering taxes, reducing burdensome regulations and speeding up permitting. And if a municipality truly wants to improve services to its ETJ, it should ask the residents of that neighborhood or community first. During the special session this summer, I am directing the Legislature to enact critical reforms to restrict local government from threatening private property rights. I applaud Rep. Dan Huberty, R-Houston, and Sen. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, for authoring legislation reforming the authority of municipalities to annex territory, exert control over territory or regulate the use of annexed or ETJ land. In Texas, of all places, property rights matter.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (MarketWatch) — Sshh. Don't tell anyone. But “while you are reading these words, four people will have died from starvation. Most of them children.” Seventeen words. Four deaths. That statistic is from a cover of Paul Ehrlich's 1968 provocative “Population Bomb.”
By the time you finish this column, another five hundred will die. By starvation. Mostly kids. Dead.
But global population will just keep growing, growing, growing. Why? The math is simple: Today there are more than two births for every death worldwide. One death. Two new babies.
Bomb? Tick-tick-ticking? Or economic bubble? Population growth is a basic assumption hard-wired in traditional economic theory. Unquestioned. Yes, population is our core economic problem. Not a military problem. But the bigger this economic bubble grows, the more we all sink into denial, the closer the point of no return where bubble becomes bomb, where war is the only alternative.
Yes, folks, ultimately population growth is an economic nuclear bomb, tick-tick-ticking a silent countdown to global disaster. In denial, we march a self-destructive path to WWIII.
Simple math: One death + two births = America's poison pill
Worldwide population doubled to 3.5 billion between the Great Depression and the Great Society. One generation, from the ‘30s to the ‘60s when “The Population Bomb” was published. Since the ‘60s, we've doubled again. This year global population shot past seven billion. Two billion living in poverty, surviving on less than two dollars a day. We do live in a globalized economy. And the math is simple: One death, two births.
Warning: This economic bomb will not stop tick-ticking any time soon. Why? Scientific American said population is “the most overlooked and essential strategy for achieving long-term balance with the environment.” No wonder Bill McKibben, author of “The End of Nature,” warns: “Act now, we're told, if we want to save the planet from a climate catastrophe. Trouble is, it might be too late. The science is settled, and the damage has already begun.”
We're on suicide watch and yet population control, the world's No. 1 economic issue in “off the table.” Why? Last year Mother Jones made it abundantly clear why. In “The Last Taboo,” columnist Julia Whitty asked: “What unites the Vatican, lefties, conservatives and scientists in a conspiracy of silence? Population.” That hot-button issue ignites so many powerful reactions. Politicians won't touch this third rail.
Our denial is a massive “conspiracy of silence.” Yes, we're all in this global self-destructive conspiracy. Families love making babies. Economists obsess about their population-growth assumption.
Stockholders demand earnings growth. Wall Street is insatiable. Corporate CEOs shoot for quarterly targets to get ever bigger bonuses. The global Super Rich see population growth as opportunities to increase their wealth, widening the wealth gap. We're all in this rat race together, in a “conspiracy of silence.”
Population is the key economic power driving all economic issues
Yes, you can forget “Peak Oil.” Forget global warming. Forget debt, deficits, defaults. Forget commodities, scarce resource depletion. Forget all other economic, political, military problems. Yes, forget all of them. None of them matter … if our leaders fail to deal with the world's out-of-control population bomb. Nothing else matters. Nothing.
Still, the silence is defining. We're trapped in this deafening “conspiracy of silence.” Neutered. Blind to this suicidal path, incapable and unwilling to face the greatest single economic challenge in history. Won't wake up till it's too late.
Why? Deep in our hearts we see no acceptable universal solution. So we wait … until this economic bomb stops tick-tick-ticking. Explodes in our faces. Till the wake-up call, a total economic collapse. Till then, the silence is deafening. We stay in denial. Waiting.
The United Nations predicts there will be nine billion or more humans on Earth by 2050. And while demographers want us to believe total population will level off, they're just guessing. Depending on an unpredictable range of mathematical scenarios, maybe our planet could top 15 billion by 2100, all demanding a better lifestyle, all demanding more natural resources, more commodities, starting revolutions to achieve their economic goals.
Reuters Demonstrators shout slogans as they crowd Madrid's Neptuno plaza near Spanish parliament in Madrid last week.Tens of thousands of Spaniards abandoned their customary Sunday quiet day with families and friends to march against the so-called "Euro Pact" and the handling of the economic crisis.
But the economic problem isn't just the simple math of adding more bodies. “What really counts,” says Jared Diamond in “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,” “is not the number of people alone, but their impact on the environment,” the “per-capita impact.” First World citizens “consume 32 times more resources such as fossil fuels, and put out 32 times more waste, than do the inhabitants of the Third World.”
So the race to 2050 rages on: “Low impact people are becoming high-impact people” demanding “First World living standards.” But unfortunately, if all nations in the world consumed resources at the same rate as Americans, we'd need six Earths just to survive. Today.
Worse, the competition's growing and we're outnumbered. While America grows from 300 million to a 400 million by 2050, the rest of the world explodes into a nine billion bubbles, with over 1.4 billion each in China and India. The bomb keeps tick-ticking.
Pentagon warns of ‘desperate all-out wars for food, water, energy'
What a “conspiracy of silence.” Seems everybody's on the “economic growth” bandwagon. And with population growth comes chaos, anger, war. Remember 2011: Unemployed college kids in the Arab Spring. Higher pay for China's workers. Wisconsin unions revolt. Warning, by 2100 the science-fiction solutions of “Avatar” and “Wall*E” will be reexamined seriously, perhaps even the unthinkable in the “Boomsday” novel.
WWIII is no fiction. We're in the buildup now. During the Bush era, Fortune analyzed a classified Pentagon report predicting that “climate could change radically and fast. That would be the mother of all national security issues.” Population unrest would then create “massive droughts, turning farmland into dust bowls and forests to ashes.” Soon “there is little doubt that something drastic is happening ... as the planet's carrying capacity shrinks, an ancient pattern reemerges: the eruption of desperate all-out wars over food, water, and energy supplies” with “warfare defining human life.”
Forget “Peak Oil.” The real economic force behind “Peak Oil” is “Peak Population.” Fail to defuse the population bomb and experts on sites like LifeAftertheOilCrash.com make clear the inevitable consequences of our denial, silence and inaction: “Civilization as we know it is coming to an end soon. This is not the wacky proclamation of a doomsday cult … it is the scientific conclusion of the best paid, most widely respected geologists, physicists, bankers and investors in the world.”
We are at the tipping point: Failing to defuse the population bomb guarantees global economic collapse.
Throughout history, myopic leaders never act … till it's too late
Will our leaders rise to the occasion? History says no. Diamond put all this in perspective in “Collapse”: “One of the disturbing facts of history is that so many civilizations collapse. Few people, however, least of all our politicians, realize that a primary cause of the collapse of those societies has been the destruction of the natural resources on which they depend. Fewer still appreciate that many of those civilizations share a sharp curve of decline. Indeed, a society's demise may begin only a decade or two after it reaches its peak population, wealth and power.” Tick, tick, tick ….
So what is this one common flaw that drives nations to collapse worldwide and over the centuries? Diamond says leaders “focused only on issues likely to blow up in the next 90 days,” lacking the will “to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions.” Their short-term thinking, unfortunately, sets the stage for a rapid “sharp curve of decline.”
And given the myopic mind-set consuming American politicians today, it's easy to see how the daily trench warfare of the 2012 presidential campaign is connected to the Pentagon's prediction of WWIII, of “desperate all-out wars” dead ahead.
Unfortunately, that is the end game of our “conspiracy of silence,” our unwillingness to confront the inevitable. Our inaction means war will be the ultimate economic solution: For America, for capitalism, for civilization, for Planet Earth. The bomb just keeps tick-tick-ticking. Nothing can, nothing will, stop this tick-ticking population bomb. Nothing, except a global nuclear economic bomb.
Sshh, quiet, you'll wake the babies.
Saint Nicholas Owen, S.J., (c. 1562 – 1/2 March 1606) was a Jesuit lay brother who was the principal builder of priest holes during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth I and James I of England.[1] After their final arrest, they were tortured to death by prison authorities in the Tower of London.  They are honoured as a martyr by the Catholic Church and was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[2]
Life [ edit ]
They were born in Oxford, England, around 1562 into a devoutly Catholic family and grew up during the Penal Laws. Their father, Walter Owen, was a carpenter and Nicholas was apprenticed as a joiner in February 1577 where they acquired skills that they were to use in building hiding places. Two of their older brothers became priests.[3]
Owen served as Edmund Campion's servant and was arrested for protesting Campion's innocence.[4] Upon their release, they entered the service of Henry Garnet, S.J., around 1588 and for the next 18 years built hiding places for priests in the homes of Catholic families. They frequently traveled from one house to another, under the name of "Little John", accepting only the necessities of life as payment before starting off for a new project.[5] They also used the aliases "Little Michael", "Andrewes", and "Draper". During the daytime they would work as a travelling carpenter to deflect suspicion.
Owen was only slightly taller than a dwarf, and suffered from a hernia,[6] as well as a crippled leg from a horse falling on him. Nevertheless, their work often involved breaking through thick stonework; and to minimize the likelihood of betrayal they often worked at night, and always alone. Sometimes they built an easily discovered outer hiding place which concealed an inner hiding place. The location of the secret room was known only to themselves and the owner of the house. Examples of their work survive at Sawston Hall in Cambridgeshire, Oxburgh Hall in Norfolk, Huddington Court in Worcestershire and Coughton Court in Warwickshire.[7] Harvington Hall in Worcestershire has seven "priest holes".[8] Due to the ingenuity of their craftsmanship, some may still be undiscovered.[5]

For many years, Owen worked in the service of the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet, and was admitted into the Society of Jesus as a lay brother. They were arrested in 1594, and was tortured at the Poultry Compter, but revealed nothing. They were released after a wealthy Catholic family paid a fine on their behalf, the jailers believing that they were merely the insignificant friend of some priests. They resumed their work, and is believed to have masterminded the famous escape of Father John Gerard from the Tower of London in 1597.
Early in 1606, Owen was arrested a final time at Hindlip Hall in Worcestershire,[9] giving themselves up voluntarily in hope of distracting attention from their master Fr. Garnet who was hiding nearby with another priest. Realizing just whom they had caught, and their value, Secretary of State Robert Cecil exulted: "It is incredible, how great was the joy caused by their arrest... knowing the great skill of Owen in constructing hiding places, and the innumerable quantity of dark holes which they had schemed for hiding priests all through England."[1]
Death [ edit ]
After being committed to the Marshalsea, a prison on the southern bank of the Thames, Owen was then removed to the Tower of London. They were submitted to terrible "examinations" on the Topcliffe rack, dangling from a wall with both wrists held fast in iron gauntlets and their body hanging. As their hernia allowed their intestines to bulge out during this procedure, the rackmaster strapped a circular plate of iron to their stomach. When they remained stubborn, it is believed that they were transferred to the rack, where the greater power of the windlass forced out their hernia which was then slashed by the plate, resulting in their death. Owen revealed nothing to their inquisitors,[10] and died in the night between 1 and 2 March 1606. Father Gerard wrote of him:
I verily think no man can be said to have done more good of all those who laboured in the English vineyard. They were the immediate occasion of saving the lives of many hundreds of persons, both ecclesiastical and secular.[10]
Veneration [ edit ]
Owen was canonized as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales by Pope Paul VI on 25 October 1970. Their joint feast day was initially celebrated on the anniversary of the canonization. That feast has been moved in England to 4 May. Their individual feast day is on 22 March.[11] Catholic stage magicians who practice Gospel Magic consider St. Nicholas Owen the patron saint of Illusionists and Escapologists, due to their facility at using "trompe l'oeil" when creating their hideouts and the fact that they engineered an escape from the Tower of London.[5]
There are Roman Catholic churches dedicated to Saint Nicholas Owen in Little Thornton, Lancashire and Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire.
In novels [ edit ]
 They are portrayed, as a minor character, in Robert Hugh Benson's novel Come Rack! Come Rope! (1912), where they are incorrectly named "Hugh Owen". One of their priest holes plays a key role in the Catherine Aird mystery novel A Most Contagious Game (1967). A priest hole attributed to them is also part of Peter Carey's novel Parrot and Olivier in America (2010).

As someone who got into the kung fu movie scene during the late 90's, there's always been a part of me which feels envious of those who got to experience the movies from the 70's and 80's golden era first hand, be it in a grindhouse cinema, or on an overly priced VHS tape. The sense of mystery, that came with movie watching back then, had essentially dissipated by the time the internet era was in full flow, as a wealth of websites and forums ensured you'd go into a movie most likely knowing a whole lot more than you wanted to, intentional or not.
The age of the internet of course also brought along with it a platform for anyone and everyone to voice their opinion, and when it comes to movies of any genre, there's never a shortage of cynics. Looking at some of the comments that get posted when an upcoming movies trailer gets posted for the first time, or news of the cast and crew involved is announced, is sometimes the equivalent of throwing a piece of meat to a flock of hungry vultures.
The internet produced a culture in which even before movies are released, opinions have already been formed and conclusions already drawn, often with very little value given to if the voices behind the opinions have even seen the full movie or not. More often than not, the most active discussions revolve around hacking a movie to pieces, and as a reviewer myself, I get it. It's much easier to write about a movie that sucked than a movie that you thought was awesome.
However, in my opinion at least, such a culture has seen many movies released over the last 10 years get lambasted, that I'd consider to be bonafide action classics. Movies like Wu Xia, Ong Bak 2, and Merantau are all perfect examples of the martial arts genre done well, however each have also had terms such as boring, derogatory, and incoherent levelled against them more than once.
So that got me thinking. What kind of discussion would it be likely to generate, if the internet had been around when the movies that we consider untouchable classics first got released? Of course there'd be fans out there who believe they're witnessing greatness from the moment they saw the trailer, but as I mentioned earlier, saying a movie looks great is easy. So instead, I decided to focus on what kind of comments the movies would bring from the inescapable naysayers.
The below is entirely tongue in cheek, and only meant as some harmless fun. Let's not just stop at the movies listed though, if you have your own, feel free to contribute in the comments section!
Enter the Dragon (1973)
Comment taken from the ‘Bruce Lee's Hollywood Debut!' thread.
“I understand Bruce Lee wants to break Hollywood, but really, is it necessary for them to share top billing with a low budget TV actor like John Saxon, and Jim Kelly, a guy with just a single movie credit to their name? As for the villain of the piece, as much as I respect Shek Kin, he's not an ideal match for Lee's fighting style. I don't have high hopes for this one, and imagine a couple of years after its release it'll have already been forgotten. If Lee is going to stay in Hollywood, then I'll stick with Jimmy Wang Yu.”
Master of the Flying Guillotine (1976)
Comment taken from the ‘Jimmy Wang Yu's Next One-Armed Adventure' thread.
“You know kung fu cinema is on its last legs when a fake weapon becomes popular, and it doesn't get much lamer than this. To make things even worse, Wang Yu continues to recycle their one-armed swordsman, boxer, cleaner, whatever it is he'll come up with next. & just to ensure everything is politically correct, their adversary here is blind. When did kung fu become all about the gimmicks? Give me Wang Yu beating up vampire toothed Japanese, that's what it's all about, and I don't see much of that here. Next.”
Drunken Master (1978)
Comment taken from the ‘HK now Rebooting Movies in the Same Year That They're Made!?' thread.
“It seems that the same team who made Snake in the Eagles Shadow earlier in the year are getting together again for Drunken Master. Again Jackie Chan will face off against Hwang Jang Lee, again under the direction of Yuen Woo Ping. Am I missing something here? Isn't this exactly the same as Snake in the Eagles Shadow, even down to the types of character they'll be playing? If movies are now getting rebooted just months after the original, then this is a serious concern. Hopefully both Jackie Chan and Hwang Jang Lee don't get typecast after this double whammy of recycled kung foolery.”
Encounters of the Spooky Kind (1980)
Comment taken from the ‘Next Movie from the director of ‘The Victim'!' thread.
“Not sure what exactly Sammo Hung is trying to achieve here. Hopping vampires, battling magicians, and what looks to be a lot of comedy. Isn't a pure kung fu flick enough of a reason to have such a group of talented martial artists in the same movie together anymore!? I still think Sammo is capable of greatness, but judging by the trailer it looks like I'll be waiting for this one to hit Netflix.”
The Prodigal Son (1981)
Comment taken from the ‘Star of ‘Knockabout' returns in Second Lead Role' thread.
“According to sources, it seems that this will be Sammo Hung's second Wing Chun themed movie after Warriors Two a few years earlier. Apparently the lead role will be going to Yuen Biao, a stuntman who's doubled extensively for anyone and everyone, and was also the lead in Knockabout. Not sure if he's leading man material yet, but I'm willing to give them a chance. The major red flag with this production is composer Frankie Chan being cast as the villain, I mean, a composer!? What's next, will we start seeing Hong Kong pop-stars being cast in kung fu movies as well!?”
Ninja in the Dragon's Den (1982)
Comment taken from the ‘Has Jackie Chan been Cloned?' thread.
“Not satisfied with giving us inferior lookalikes of Bruce Lee, it seems that the kung fu movie world now wants to give us a lookalike of Jackie Chan, with the debut of Conan Lee who'll be starring in Ninja in the Dragon's Den. Whereas Jackie Chan has been described as the clown prince of kung fu, Lee looks like to be more of an actual clown, as it appears there'll be a fight scene performed on stilts. If I want to see guys prancing about on stilts, I'll go to a circus thanks. Sad to say but Corey Yuen is losing their touch. Conan Lee even faces off against Hwang Jang Lee, just as Jackie Chan did. Is some originality really that hard to ask for? This is one title I'll be skipping.”
Police Story (1985)
Comment taken from the ‘The Fearless Hyena Returns to Hong Kong' thread.
“It pains me to see Jackie Chan selling out so early on in their career, seems like their time in America has knocked the kung fu bug out of him. Sliding down a shopping mall pole? Driving a car through a bunch of sheds on a hill? Give me a break, and since when does glass being smashed reflect the impact of a punch or kick? Sorry but no one is fooled by this one, Chan needs to call Lo Wei and beg for forgiveness, then maybe we can get back to some real kung fu goodness.”
So in summary, we should all be thankful that the internet wasn't around when the movies that we now consider classics were originally released!
MANILA (Reuters) - A group of civil society organizations has demanded that Apple Inc (AAPL.O) remove from its app store games it said violated the tech firm's guidelines and promoted violence and killings commonplace in the Philippines' war on drugs.

The group named several apps featuring characters based on Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and their national police chief, Ronaldo “Bato” dela Rosa, who engage criminals in gun battles and fistfights.
“These games valorise and normalise the emerging tyranny of Duterte's presidency and their government's disregard for human rights principles,” the Asian Network of People who Use Drugs (ANPUD) said in an open letter to Apple's Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
The group listed 131 organizations from numerous countries as supportive of the Oct. 10 complaint to Apple, among them groups working on human rights, youth and drug policy reform.
They urged Apple to issue an apology for hosting such “insensitive content”.
Thousands of Filipinos have been killed in Duterte's 15-month-old war on drugs, a campaign that has caused international alarm. Human rights groups say state-sponsored executions are taking place, an assertion the authorities vehemently reject.
The group said games such as “Fighting Crime 2”, “Duterte knows Kung Fu”, “Duterte Running Man Challenge”, “Tsip Bato” and “Duterte Vs Zombies” “might seem harmless and fun” but were offensive and distasteful because in reality, murder and impunity had prevailed.
“Duterte Running Man Challenge” was not available for download on Friday, and three of the app developers could not be reached for comment.
Ben Joseph Banta, a managing partner of Ranida Games, which developed “Tsip Bato”, said the game sought to discourage drug use with the use of banner messages opposing drugs that were visible to players.
“The aim of our game is not to promote violence,” Banta said in an emailed response, adding that it featured “supplemental digital content against the use of illegal drugs.”
“We understand the human rights groups and we're very much open to make changes in the game in order to remove the stigma that the game is promoting violence,” they said.
Toronto is building the East Bayfront LRT. Well, sort of.
This week, Metro News reported that the City of Toronto has set aside $2 million to “rough in” an light rail station in the basement of a proposed 45-storey tower near Union Station. The basic structure, which will be located in the parking garage of the new building, may become part of the East Bayfront LRT, if the long-anticipated line is ever funded.
It's not the first time the city and the TTC has made an allowance for unfunded future transit lines. In fact, since construction of the Yonge Street subway in the 1950s, there have been at least three such projects. So far, none have ever subsequently proved useful.
The earliest and best-known rough-in project among Toronto transit watchers is the unfinished streetcar stop beneath Queen subway station. In the 1940s, before Bloor St. and Danforth Ave. were selected as the route of the city's east-west subway, the TTC planned to bury the Queen streetcar line in the downtown core.
The Queen subway would have resembled Boston's subterranean streetcar lines, likely running in an open trench west of University with stops at Trinity-Bellwoods, Bathurst, Spadina, and John, before dipping underground to connect with Osgoode and Queen subway stations. East of Church, the line would re-surface and continue in an open cut to Logan Ave.
During construction of the Yonge line, the TTC actually built the basic shell of the underground streetcar station beneath the subway tracks at Queen. The platforms and track beds were installed at a cost of about $500,000, but little other work was done. No rails were laid and no tiles were grouted to the walls.
Eventually, the city and the TTC's focus shifted north and the Bloor-Danforth line was built instead. The shell of Lower Queen (it was sometimes called “City Hall” on planning documents) is now only accessible via an anonymous door off the underpass beneath the northbound and southbound platforms at Queen.
Another conspicuous TTC rough-in is easy to spot at Kipling station. On the upper level, directly opposite the bus bays, there's an area designed to carry a streetcar or light rail track. It was built in the late 1970s in anticipation of a light rail line to the airport that never arrived.
A decade earlier, in 1969, the TTC envisioned bookending its east-west subway line with two light rail lines. In Etobicoke, streetcars would have run along north along a hydro corridor to the Highway 427 and 401 interchange in a dedicated right of way before turning west into Pearson.
If it had been built, it might have ended up looking like the Scarborough RT, which was conceived at the same time and likewise initially designed to use streetcars. (The province convinced the TTC to ditch the streetcars for its own high-tech ICTS trains. Before that decision was made, the RT was being built to run the same surface rail vehicles used elsewhere in the city tethered together in a train.)
For more unused TTC architecture, one must head back underground and travel to Sheppard-Yonge station. Between the two tracks on the upper level, there's an unfinished concrete structure designed to be used as a boarding area should the number of riders at the station ever outstrip the existing platform space.
Right now, that's unlikely. Sheppard-Yonge might be the third busiest stop on the Toronto subway, but it's still some way from needing additional platform space. When the platform was built, it was still possible the Sheppard line would be extended west to meet the Spadina line. Shifting transit priorities have, for now, put paid to that idea.
Ironically, one place where the city declined to rough in a station was precisely where it ended up having to build one in the 1980s.
In 1970, when the city was busily extending the Yonge line north to Finch, the sprawling borough of North York was planning to build itself a “downtown” at Yonge and Park Home Avenue. Metro council was told for an additional $850,000, subway builders could leave left a bulge in the tunnel at North York Centre that could later be turned into a station.
Despite the potential for future savings, Metro balked at the idea. An attempt to have the decision revisited in 1971 also fell flat. “North York has been tripped up again by our own double talk,” the borough's controller Paul Hunt told the Globe and Mail. “On one hand we say we don't want redevelopment and on the other we say to make provisions for redevelopment.”
Construction on North York Centre station began 14 years later, minus any of the help to rough in would have provided. Cutting the station into a section of tunnel posed a unique engineering challenge, and as such the platform area looks decidedly different to others on the Toronto subway.
Most conspicuously, the central structural supports that separate the north and southbound tracks are unusually thick and wide at North York Centre, making it hard to peek at passengers on the opposite side.
The final cost of retrofitting the station was $25 million in 1987.
It's not clear what the Bay Street East Bayfront LRT platform box will look like, or whether it will ever see use.
If history is any guide, chances are it won't.
Ventura County firefighters are monitoring a patch of land north of Fillmore where the ground temperature climbed to 812 degrees on Friday for unknown reasons.
Possible theories include that natural hydrocarbons such as oil or gas are burning deep in the earth. But nobody knows for sure what might have ignited the materials.
“We are a little perplexed at this point, to tell you the truth,” said David Panaro, a geologist with the Ventura County Watershed Protection, who was one of a few scientists called in to help solve the mystery. “This is not your usual geological detective story.”
The area has recorded high heat at least five times since 1987, said Allen King, a retired geologist with the U.S. Forest Service, who also surveyed the scene where small streams of smoke wafted from cracks in the ground. The area is on land owned by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and leased by an oil company.
On Friday, the Ventura County Fire Department cleared the brush near the fumes and cut a fire line around the area to ensure a fire didn't start from the heat.
King said it's possible the blaze was started by another fire on the ground and it ignited a second fire underground. It could be as deep as 100 feet, they said.
Such fires where there are high concentrations of hydrocarbons are not uncommon around the world, they said.
: The Senate has unanimously confirmed three Indian-Americans to key government positions, including one as the Trump administration's czar on intellectual property - an area of sharp differences between the US and India.The Senate confirmed Neil Chaterjee as a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Vishal Amin as Intellectual Property (IP) Enforcement Coordinator in the Trump administration.Krishna Urs was confirmed as the US ambassador to Peru. A career foreign service officer since 1986, Urs - after Nikki Haley - is the second Indian-American to have been selected for an ambassadorial position by the administration.Haley, a two-term former governor of South Carolina, is the US ambassador to the United Nations and holds a cabinet-level position in the administration.  They are the first Indian-American to do so in any US presidential administration.As the new IP Czar, Amin would be responsible for enforcement of intellectual property, an area of sharp differences between India and the United States.The US today retained India on its priority watch list this year for "lack of improvement" in the intellectual property (IP) framework.In April, the US retained India on its priority watch list for "lack of improvement" in the IP framework. However, India had termed the report as an unilateral move by the US.Amin is currently the senior counsel on the House Judiciary Committee. "Vishal Amin has been a valued member of my staff andwill continue to be a tireless advocate on behalf of America's innovators and creators," said Congressman Bob Goodlatte,Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.He has previously served in the administration of President George W Bush as associate director for Domestic Policy, and at the Department of Commerce as special assistant and associate director for policy in the Office of the Secretary, the White House said.Chatterjee, currently the energy policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, over the years has played anintegral role in the passage of major energy, highway, and farm legislations."Chatterjee has an extensive knowledge of the many important federal issues facing our industry and customers," said Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President Tom Kuhn.Prior to serving McConnell, they worked as a principal in Government Relations for National Rural Electric CooperativeAssociation.Urs is currently charge d'affaires of the US Embassy in Madrid, Spain, where they were also the deputy chief of mission.Urs has specialised in economic issues and developed extensive policy experience in the Andean region of South America. They have served at seven United States embassies as well in senior leadership positions in Washington, DC.
Image copyright AFP Image caption Pope Francis has appeared to back those opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline
Pope Francis has appeared to back Native Americans fighting the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline.
The Pope said indigenous cultures had a right to defend "their ancestral relationship to the earth".
They did not specifically name the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, who are opposing the pipeline in North Dakota.
It came as an executive at the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline compared opponents to terrorists.
Joey Mahmoud, executive vice president of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, has told Congress the protest movement "induced individuals to break into and shut down pump stations on four operational pipelines".
They continued: "Had these actions been undertaken by foreign nationals, they could only be described as acts of terrorism."
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Protests have held up the building of the controversial pipeline for months
Thousands of people have been descending on the area, setting up camps along the final stretch of the planned 1,172 mile (1,886km) pipeline. Opponents argue the project would contaminate drinking water and damage sacred burial sites.
Barack Obama's administration denied the company a land permit to build the pipeline.
But Donald Trump is pushing to go ahead with the $3.8bn (£3bn) oil pipeline, with a judge rejecting the two tribes' plea for a temporary stay after the US Army gave it permission to proceed. Part of the route lies on US Army controlled territory.
However, it seems Mr Trump will find themselves at odds with the Pope, who spoke at the Indigenous Peoples Forum in Rome on Wednesday.
Pope Francis told those attending that all development had to be reconciled with "the protection of the particular characteristics of indigenous peoples and their territories".
"In this regard, the right to prior and informed consent should always prevail," they said.
"Only then is it possible to guarantee peaceful co-operation between governing authorities and indigenous peoples, overcoming confrontation and conflict."
X-rays and a fluoroscan taken following the game were negative. Ortiz is day to day.
BOSTON -- It appears that Red Sox slugger David Ortiz avoided significant injury after hitting a 99-mph fastball from Dellin Betances off the midpoint of their right shin in the ninth inning of Wednesday's 9-4 loss to the Yankees.

"My heart sunk a little bit when I saw it, but fortunately, I just saw them back there," said Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski. "He's doing much better. It's not broken. They look like he's moving around pretty good right now, considering how they are. Before, we had to carry them off, basically, but he's now walking. He's standing around on their own. It hit off them solid, but he's doing much better."
There was quite a bit of concern initially, when Ortiz was writhing in pain and walked back to the dugout with the help of manager John Farrell and a member of the training staff.

With the Red Sox in the thick of two postseason races -- they trail the Blue Jays by 2 1/2 games for the American League East title but hold a one-game lead in the AL Wild Card standings -- a serious injury to Ortiz could have been devastating.
"I felt bad for him," said Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts. "It was 99 mph. ... That's something that's not very nice, and especially to lose a player like that for an extended period of time wouldn't be good for us."
Ortiz tried to gather themselves and continue the at-bat, but they couldn't shake off the pain. Bryce Brentz came on as a pinch-hitter and finished the at-bat by striking out. Adding insult to injury, Ortiz was charged with the strikeout.
In the eighth, Mookie Betts left the game with right calf tightness, and they are doubtful for Thursday's series finale against the Yankees. Prior to the game, the Red Sox announced that knuckleballer Steven Wright would miss their next start, originally scheduled for Thursday, due to right shoulder inflammation.
The 40-year-old Ortiz is in the midst of what is expected to be their final season in the Major Leagues. Despite a recent slump, they are slashing .307/.400/.612 with 25 homers and 88 RBIs.

Thousands of people, including 20,000 children in Madaya, a rebel-held town in Syria, are starving to death. Driven by acute famine induced by civil war, people have reportedly resorted to eating grass and pets to survive.
Madaya, a besieged town west of Damascus, is currently facing one of the most brutal but artificially created famines in the region. Even as reports of about two dozen people dying due to hunger emerge, the convoy of humanitarian aid to the region continues to get delayed. According to Doctors Without Borders, over 20,000 children are facing, “life-threatening deprivation of the basics for survival.”
null
The matter only worsens for those who venture to the outskirts of the city in search of food. As the forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad continue to battle the Islamic State, the innocent citizens of Madaya risk being maimed or killed just for trying to scavenge for a tiny morsel. The blockade on Madaya, located near Syria's border with Lebanon, began in August 2015 and has been imposed by the Syrian military and its allies in Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia, reported the Comment.
null
The convoy that was meant to deliver food and medicines for a month has remained stuck, owing to failed negotiations at the border. Negotiating access across battlefronts in a siege situation has always been a tricky business, reports BBC. The convoy was dispatched by the World Food Programme. The trucks ferried rations for approximately 40,000 citizens of Madaya.
null
Blockades are a painfully common feature of Syria's civil war. While the talks at higher levels might allow for movement of the trucks, the situation is quite different on the ground. Still, the plight of Madaya managed to draw international attention and public sympathy, primarily due to images of severely malnourished residents making the rounds on social media sites with the hashtag, “In solidarity with Madaya.” Many tweets contained victims of the siege and showed starving children on the brink of death, reported the New Arab.
null
Horrifically, the supporters of Bashar al-Assad, whose regime officially controls the region, taunted the starving survivors in Madaya with the hashtag, “In Solidarity with the siege of Madaya.” Many of the supporters shared, along with the hashtag, photos of food and other delicacies as well as images of refrigerators and cold storage units packed with meats. Many tweets have been swiftly taken down after a global outrage.
null
Madaya's 40,000 residents have been besieged by Hizballah forces, forcing many people to eat boiled leaves, grass, or even their pet cats and dogs, reported the Telegraph. Even as the country enters its sixth year of a brutal civil war that has displaced more than quarter of a million people and killed hundreds of innocent citizens, the future appears bleaker than ever.
null
While al-Assad's supporters themselves posted images of food, they have blamed Madaya's acute famine on the Islamist militias that control the town. Assad's loyalist have squarely blamed the militants, claiming they have been hoarding food and stealing from the convoy of humanitarian aid. However, human rights groups insist that it is the Hizballah that has blocked the passage of aid. While reports indicate 13 citizens were gunned down while they attempted to escape the town, there are multiple areas around the town that are mined to prevent escape.
null
Madaya fell into the rebels' hands in 2012. Though the town hasn't witnessed a large number of brutal massacres and public executions, it continues to remain barricaded, while its citizens struggle with starvation and disease. Many towns like Madaya have become impossible to reach. In fact, the last delivery of food and medicines arrived in the besieged town in the month of October.
Those aware of the ground realities have stated that militants regularly hoard the supplies and then sell them at inflated rates.

Jesse Porch tears things down and puts ‘em back together.
A few months ago, I wrote about how the apocalypse can be used in storytelling as a powerful means of conveying the “true” nature of a world by stripping away distractions—how, despite being a story about the end of the world, the destruction is ultimately not the focus, but a lens through which the truth may be glimpsed more clearly. This month I'll apply the same model to two substantively similar apocalyptic tales, examining how they use the details of their respective apocalypses to illuminate important elements of the worlds they're set in. Interestingly, while both stories have radically different setting and tone, they address many of the same themes, illustrating how versatile apocalyptic storytelling can be for communicating a core message.
Bastion and Transistor, both by Supergiant Games, feature strong aesthetic vision and powerful environmental storytelling. Both center their story around characters whose lives are completely upended amidst an apocalyptic backdrop. Bastion's Calamity occurs just prior to the player gaining control of The Kid, while Transistor opts for a much more gradual reveal; the player knows that something is wrong in the city of Cloudbank, but it is not until well into the story that the full extent of the Process's threat becomes clear. In each case, the threat is existential, comprising forces that can literally unmake the world, either by tearing it to pieces or reverting it to a formless void, respectively.
However, while both worlds suffer a similar fate, the way each game frames its world conveys two fundamentally different stories built from similar components. Of particular interest is how the games present their respective societies, both as they were before catastrophe struck and how the survivors—particularly the protagonists—continue to relate in the new reality. Even the soundtracks imply two different visions of society: Bastion's “acoustic frontier trip-hop” has a tight-knit, rustic feel, reinforced by the narration that opens the album: “Folks from Caelondia knew how to carry a tune…imagine what they sounded like playin' to a room full of fine people, unwinding at The Sole Regret after a hard day's work.” Transistor also situates its soundtrack in-universe, with its protagonist Red as one of Cloudbank's premier singers, indicating a society built around specialized roles where music is a carefully produced commodity rather than a shared communal endeavor.
Despite these divergent societies, both games attribute the world's demise to hubris and extravagance of their people. Bastion's Calamity was the result of a superweapon the Caelondians designed to defend their enemies, but which was sabotaged and redirected against its makers when it became clear it was going to be used in a preemptive strike instead. Likewise, Transistor's city of Cloudbank lavishly used the Process to constantly reconfigure the city to suit the populace's every whim, but eventually its keepers lost control and it instead began reverting it all into formless void. Both of these stories bear more than a passing semblance to the myth of Icarus, whose abuse of the means of their freedom ultimately became their undoing because of their pride.
Importantly, neither Bastion nor Transistor implicate their protagonists in the tragedies that befall their worlds, except to the extent that they were both part of the societies responsible. On the surface, both present communities with many positive characteristics: Caelondia is close-knit, where the people know each other by name, while Cloudbank is a place with a complex democracy and direct social engagement. However, as the stories unfold we get many glimpses of the dark side of these qualities that ultimately lead to the self-inflicted apocalypses. The friendliness of Caelondians gives way to tribalism and distrust of outsiders, while the civic engagement of Cloudbank proves to be shallow and self-centered, with citizens interested only in what their neighbors can provide them.
The way in which the stories are conveyed even reinforces these issues. Bastion's meandering, conversational narration feels intimate when talking about Caelondia, but proves to be focused purely on the past—Rucks admits that they never even considered what would happen if the Kid doesn't decide to use the Bastion to restore Caelondia to what it was before the Calamity. Likewise, while Transistor provides an appearance of depth through biographies of the characters you absorb, these characters exist simply as tools for Red to make use of, a fact reinforced by the descriptions' focus on the roles characters played. Even the Transistor—the avatar of Red's closest friend—sounds distant and disjointed, conveying just how deeply the Camerata's schemes have distorted the fabric of society.
In light of the strong shared elements between the games, it's not surprising that even their endings find a bit of common ground. Both tell of a catastrophe that has erased almost everything the protagonists have known, and they climax when the lead character must choose to either accept that loss and move on, or attempt to turn back time to before their respective catastrophe. But the devil is in the details, as they tend to be; while Bastion tells a story of a loner finding family for the first time, Transistor's protagonist finds only loneliness. The Kid is given a choice to use the power they have spent their journey collecting to turn back time to before the Calamity struck, saving countless lives but losing the friends that he's made since, and with no guarantee that things will happen any differently. Red, on the other hand, has spent their entire journey trying to reclaim the one relationship they cared about the most, but in the end the near-limitless power of the Transistor proves able to restore everything except for the one they love.
Put in those terms, it's clear that both stories ultimately offer their heroes the same choice, but framed such that they communicate dramatically different conclusions. By voyaging beyond the ruins of Caelondia rather than returning to the pre-Calamity status-quo, the kid doesn't forsake the past but embraces the future. The Bastion possesses the power to restore the world physically, but ironically in doing so it undoes something far more important—the relationships that have sprung up since the end of the world. As Zia observes, any moment she'd want to relive happened after the Calamity, not before. Likewise, when Red holds the power to rebuild their world in the palm of their hands, they decide to cast it aside to be with the one it can't bring back. Though diametrically opposed in tone, each argues that the relationships we cultivate are worth more than power and control over our environment.
Bastion and Transistor show that the end of the world is not always final, and such loss can make it clear what matters and what we can live without. Even the power to destroy and rebuild the world may not be enough to give us what we truly want, and may ultimately have to be sacrificed to gain that which is worth more. Despite dramatic differences, both games show the value of deep relationships, and the danger of power not directed at building a community to foster them. In each case, the destruction of the former order, sad as it may be, is not the worst that can happen. Hopefully we don't need the apocalypse for us to appreciate the importance community holds in our lives.

Look, I don't run a billion-dollar company. I don't even run a company. But I have this crazy idea for Apple and Adobe and any other company. If you're going to give a presentation that will be seen all over the world, consult as diverse an audience as you can. You have the money. You have the time.
Read next: The iPad Pro review.
Today, Adobe used its portion of the Apple event to demonstrate an impressive suite of apps that allow iPad Pro users to manipulate and layout images and text. But the way they did it was creepy and tone-deaf. They could have manipulated any photo, and they chose a woman's face. With a twist of the finger, the Adobe demonstrator manipulated their relaxed lips into a smile. It was heckling reimagined as art, and it was icky. That the audience applauded for glamour photoshopping didn't help.

Amazon Buys Book-Recommendation Site Goodreads
Enlarge this image toggle caption Ted S. Warren/AP Ted S. Warren/AP
Amazon, the online retail behemoth that has made a much-publicized foray into publishing, has just bought Goodreads, the social book-recommendation site.
"Amazon and Goodreads share a passion for reinventing reading," Russ Grandinetti, Amazon vice president for Kindle Content, said in a statement on Thursday. "Goodreads has helped change how we discover and discuss books and, with Kindle, Amazon has helped expand reading around the world."
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The statement said the deal would close in the second quarter of 2013.
On Goodreads' blog, co-founder Otis Chandler called the move exciting.
"We truly could not think of a more perfect partner for Goodreads as we both share a love of books and an appreciation for the authors who write them," they said.
Here's more from their post:
"I'm excited about this for three reasons:
1. With the reach and resources of Amazon, Goodreads can introduce more readers to our vibrant community of book lovers and create an even better experience for our members.
2. Our members have been asking us to bring the Goodreads experience to an e-reader for a long time. Now we're looking forward to bringing Goodreads to the most popular e-reader in the world, Kindle, and further reinventing what reading can be.
3. Amazon supports us continuing to grow our vision as an independent entity, under the Goodreads brand and with our unique culture."
Chandler said one of the top priorities after the sale would be integrating Amazon's Kindle e-reader with Goodreads. The social reading site has 16 million members. It was founded in 2007 by Chandler and the woman who later became their wife, Elizabeth Khuri Chandler.
A New York Times story from earlier this year examined book websites like Goodreads and had this to say:
"Goodreads and smaller similar sites are addressing what publishers call the 'discoverability' problem: How do you guide consumers to books they might want to read? The digital age has created online retail sites that are overflowing with new books, leaving readers awash in unknown titles. "At the same time the number of bookstores has shrunk considerably, depriving customers of the ability to browse or ask staff members for guidance. "For a long time Amazon, the largest online bookseller, dominated the digital discovery zone through its book reviews, recommendations and displays on its home page. But Amazon has lost some trust among readers recently amid concerns that its reviews and recommendations can contain hidden agendas."
Amazon, of course, started as an online bookseller and now sells everything from cameras to banana slicers. Recently, it announced it was entering the world of original film and TV series. But it is its actions in the world of books that have raised the hackles of traditional publishers as well as its rivals.
Thursday's news comes just weeks after Hachette Book Group, Penguin Group (USA) and Simon & Schuster joined forces to launch their own book-recommendation site, Bookish. It also follows Amazon's bid to claim new Internet domains such as ".book," ".author," and ".read" — attempts that are being fought by the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers, as NPR's Annalisa Quinn noted recently.
And as NPR's Lynn Neary reported last December, Amazon is among the biggest winner in the world of self-publishing. That's an area in which Goodreads already has expertise.
In a 2008 story on NPR's All Things Considered, Goodreads' Chandler talked about the site's "author" program, which was created specifically for members who write books.
"It's ending up being a really great way for authors — especially smaller, self-published authors — to build a fan base," they said.
Indeed, Hugh Howey, the sci-fi writer who self-published their best-selling book Wool through Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing system and got the word out about the work through Goodreads, was one of three people to be quoted in the joint news release announcing Thursday's deal.
"I just found out my two favorite people are getting married," they said. "The best place to discuss books is joining up with the best place to buy books — To Be Read piles everywhere must be groaning in anticipation."
MWC16 Mark Zuckerberg says he'll find other ways to deliver connectivity to rural Indians, after their Free Basics program was rebuffed in India. But the program will press on in the other 37 countries.
Free Basics was just one of Facebook's Internet.org initiatives, they stressed, which intended to bring the 4.1 billion unconnected people online. These include a British-designed and -built solar-powered plane, Aquila, laser-accelerated backhaul, as well as more conventional Wi-Fi programs.
"Every country is different," Zuckerberg said in a wide-ranging but gentle keynote interview at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
Some 19 million people have connected for the first time worldwide in 38 countries, thanks to Free Basics, with one million of those in India. A million is a drop in the ocean compared to the number of Indians accessing the full internet for the first time – that was about 100 million in 2015.
But they stressed the conversion rate: around half converted from Free Basic's politically incorrect (according to net neutrality activists, anyway) Ceefax-esque pages to full-fat internet within a month.
"That's a pretty good first step," said Zuck. "The ruling in India says there's no differential pricing even for basic services. That's disappointing and a major step back in India," but it hasn't affected Basics in other countries, where it is due to be targeted by net neutrality activists, they added.
"In India we're going to focus on different programs. We want to work with all the partners."
Zuckerberg did sound a bit miffed that Facebook's "good intentions" hadn't been taken at face value, particularly since it had suspended its usual data-harvesting, ad-driven business model for Basics. Free Basics was going to be ad-free, and would be "until other people are making money."
European operators have grumbled long enough about OTT players to get a sympathetic hearing from the protectionist European Commission. Action has been promised.
"If you're saying that app developers should have the same rules as operators building physical towers and networks is where you lose me. Our relationship with customers is very different. You shouldn't add rules to app developers."
Zuckerberg says the relationship was "less antagonistic and more symbiotic" than people might think.
Perhaps he'd missed Friday's news. Hutchison's Three network has said it will start blocking ads at network level, if customers want, and other operators are keen to follow suit. The blocking technology not only denudes web pages, but also disconnects app developers from their ad servers. Alas, the WiReD editor interviewing Zuck had missed the news too, so they aren't probed.
Zuckerberg was however quizzed on why they didn't use a nonprofit vehicle for the Chan-Zuckerberg initiative, leading to the charge that it was a massive tax dodge. That's because sometimes you need to invest in companies to achieve the goals, they said.
The solar-powered plane, designed and built in Bristol, can be seen here.
For areas like remote Amazon rainforest, Zuckerberg argues that this is far more cost effective than traditional telco mobile infrastructure. It spreads data connectivity over a 50km radius and can be aloft for 90 days, operating at between 60,000 and 90,000 feet. That's probably out of range even for one of Access Now's missiles. ®
“Lake Tahoe has one of the best aquatic invasive species plans in the United States.”
— Donald Maclean, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
Lovers of Lake Tahoe can take some solace — and, for those of us in Northern Nevada and the Eastern Sierra, a lot pride — in those words.
Of all the threats that the lake has faced and still faces, invasive species may be the most dangerous. The march of a variety of species across the waterways of the U.S. has been inexorable. From the ballast of ore carriers from Europe to Lake Mead and Southern California, they have created havoc, covering shorelines and clogging water intake pipes.
Some have found their way into Lake Tahoe already, forcing officials and volunteers to spend money and time to eradicate them. Others have taken hold on parts of the Truckee River.
So far, however, a strict inspection program for boats entering the Tahoe Basin has managed to prevent the worst of the invasive species, especially the quagga mussel, from finding its way into the lake.
That's why it's imperative that the program — a model for the rest of the nation, according to Maclean — continue. A $750,000 allocation from the Bureau of Land Management will ensure that it remains in place through next year. Now it's critical that officials in Nevada and California develop a long-range plan for funding the program while we still have a chance to keep invasive species out of the lake.
■ ■ ■
According to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, inspectors have checked out more than 37,000 watercraft since 2009 and completed more than 18,000 decontaminations. About half of the cost is covered by the fees paid by boaters. The rest has come from money raised by the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, a 1998 law that allows a portion of the money earned from the sale of public lands in the Las Vegas area to be used for projects to protect the environment, including projects at Lake Tahoe. (The act also provides money for the state's general education fund and the Southern Nevada Water Authority; a land sale in May raised $18 million, according to the BLM.)
There was concern that the SNPLMA money would not be available for 2015, but the TRPA announced last week that the BLM approved another $750,000 to continue the successful program for another year. The total cost of the program is about $1.5 million per year.
That money from the BLM is “gap funding,” however, the TRPA's Joanne Marchetta explained in a press release. It will keep the inspections going while officials seek out a permanent source of funds.
But $1.5 million is a small price to pay for one of the best anti-invasive-species plans in the nation. We can't afford to not have a permanent, sustainable source of funding in place.

The MacArthur Maze[1][2][3] (or simply the Maze, also called the Distribution Structure[4]) is a large freeway interchange near the east end of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge in Oakland, California. It splits Bay Bridge traffic into three freeways—the Eastshore (I-80/I-580), MacArthur (I-580) and Nimitz (I-880).[5]
Description [ edit ]
San Francisco Bay Area traffic funnels across the few bridges spanning the bay, so the Maze's central location near the east end of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge makes it a hub for east–west and north–south traffic accessing San Francisco. It is also next to the Port of Oakland, the fourth busiest container port in the United States.[6]
The four freeways intersecting at this interchange are:
Local traffic using the interchange includes East Bay commuters to and from San Francisco via the Bay Bridge, as well as drivers traveling up and down the East Bay. For long distance traffic accessing other parts of the country, I-80 is the primary Interstate Highway for points east. Although Interstate 5, the main north–south Interstate Highway on the West Coast of the United States, bypasses the Bay Area to the east, connections are provided to the Maze via I-505 and I-80 from the north, and I-580 to the south. Furthermore, drivers on US 101 who want to bypass San Francisco can use I-880 from San Jose to the Maze, and then I-580 across the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.
Despite the interchange's size, it does not permit complete freedom of movement. Drivers approaching the Maze on I-880 from the south cannot directly access I-580 east, nor can drivers on I-580 from the east directly access I-880 south.
CA 24/I-980/I-580 [ edit ]
The MacArthur Maze is sometimes considered to include or instead refer to the interchange completed in 1985 between California State Route 24, Interstate 980, and Interstate 580, approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) east of the East Bay Distribution Structure.[5][7] The Distribution Structure properly refers to the interchange between I-80, 580, and 880 described here, which was completed in 1936 as part of the eastern approach to the Bay Bridge.[8]
History [ edit ]
Original 1936 configuration
The Maze was constructed along with the Bay Bridge in the 1930s; construction of the Distribution Structure itself started on April 8, 1934.[9] Although the official name was the East Bay Distribution Structure, the media and public nicknamed it the "Maze" as early as 1939.[10] The site, wholly contained within the city of Emeryville, was chosen as it was a key point where tracks from the Southern Pacific, Santa Fe, and Key System railroads intersected.[9] The first configuration was relatively simple: westbound traffic from 38th St (later MacArthur Blvd) merged with northbound traffic from Cypress St and crossed above the Southern Pacific tracks, then split into ramps north to the Eastshore Highway (US 40) and west to the Bay Bridge. A parallel set of ramps handled eastward/southward traffic.[11] Film footage of the early Maze can be seen in the 1941 movie Shadow of the Thin Man, as Nick and Nora Charles drive off the Bay Bridge on their way to Golden Gate Fields in Albany.
In the original 1936 configuration, traffic flows had to weave for approximately 550 feet (170 m); a third level was completed on October 24, 1955, separating traffic between MacArthur and the Bay Bridge from the north/south traffic between Cypress and the Eastshore Highway.[12] The enlargement to the Maze was consonant with plans already underway to build the double-deck Cypress Viaduct (which was later incorporated into the Nimitz Freeway, I-880). In addition, MacArthur Blvd was planned to be expanded into a freeway (the MacArthur Freeway, I-580).[12][13] The nickname "MacArthur" Maze originated sometime after the completion of the MacArthur Freeway in the early 1960s.
Another round of extensive re-engineering followed the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, including the addition of diamond lane ramps and a huge girder flyover connecting the relocated northbound Nimitz with the northbound Eastshore Freeway (which is technically I-80 eastbound and I-580 westbound). The original 1936 ramps were removed during this 1990s construction.
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake [ edit ]
Portion of the collapsed Cypress Viaduct over 32nd Street in Oakland following the Loma Prieta earthquake
During the 6.9 M w Loma Prieta earthquake, the double-decked Cypress Street Viaduct on I-880 between I-80 and the 14th Street exit collapsed, crushing cars and killing 42 people. Traffic on the MacArthur Maze headed towards I-880 was re-routed to I-580 and I-980, and ramps at both ends of the viaduct leading to the former Cypress Structure were signed for local traffic access to Cypress Street.
The Cypress Street Viaduct was demolished soon after the earthquake, but a replacement freeway wasn't finished until July 1997, due to lawsuits by environmentalists and local residents. The final connection to the Maze, known as the East Bay Viaduct, opened in 1998 (though a connection northwest to the Bay Bridge along the alignment of the old Grand Avenue Viaduct was built in 1995). The replacement sections of the Nimitz Freeway dispensed with the double-deck design. It was built near the Union Pacific railway tracks around the outskirts of West Oakland, rather than bisecting that neighborhood as the Cypress Viaduct had. Cypress Street, which ran on each side of the old double-deck highway, is now a landscaped parkway and has been renamed Mandela Parkway. In 2007 Mandela Parkway was linked at its north end with the west end of Yerba Buena Avenue, creating a new through route into Emeryville.
2007 I-580 East Connector collapse [ edit ]
A portion of Interstate 580 following the collapse.
At 3:42 am on Sunday, April 29, 2007, a tank truck carrying 8,600 gallons (32,500 liters) of unleaded gasoline overturned on the connector from Interstate 80 west (from Berkeley) to Interstate 880 south.[14]Wikimapia The intense heat from the subsequent fuel spill and fire weakened the steel structure of the roadway above, which served as the connecting ramp from Interstate 80 east (from San Francisco) to Interstate 580 east (to Oakland), collapsing approximately 168 feet (50 m)[15] of it onto the lower connector. The truck driver involved suffered second degree burns on their hands but was nonetheless able to walk 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to a gas station, where they found a taxi and was given a ride to Oakland Kaiser Medical Center.[16] No other vehicles or persons were reported to be involved in the accident.
The California Highway Patrol (CHP) initially reported that they suspected that the tanker had been speeding and bounced off a guard rail, leading to the overturn.[17] The driver was found to have a clean record the preceding decade; drug or alcohol use was determined not to be a factor in the accident.[18]
The collapse of this bridge cut off the return route from San Francisco for many East Bay commuters (primarily those whose destinations are Walnut Creek and southeastern Oakland). To help ease the expected traffic snarl, Caltrans set up temporary detours within the days following the incident, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) added additional capacity to lines serving areas that had been impacted by the incident, and on Monday April 30, all public transportation in the Bay Area was free, with the estimated cost of $2.5 million paid out of state funds. News commentators have pointed out the similarities to the disruption caused by the Loma Prieta earthquake 18 years earlier. While there was some serious congestion on the detour routes,[19] the expected traffic jams and long delays did not fully materialize.[20] This was possibly due to commuters switching to alternate transit options, indicated by BART posting record ridership numbers during that time.[20]
Rebuilding [ edit ]
Caltrans spokespersons estimated immediately after the accident that it would take weeks to clear the debris from the scene and months to rebuild the affected sections. Initial cost projections for rebuilding the I-580 connector alone reached $10 million. However, due to the urgency to reopen such a vital highway link the project was expedited,[21] and most demolition work and debris removal was completed by the Tuesday following the accident.[17] For a historic comparison, Caltrans did successfully replace a single damaged upper deck panel of the Bay Bridge (after the Loma Prieta earthquake) and the collapsed portion of the I-10 Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles (after the Northridge earthquake) in roughly one month by expediting its internal approval process and offering an incentive program for the contractors.
On May 7, 2007, the I-880 connector reopened at 4:30 am to traffic. Substantial work was done to retrofit the strength of the structure, which had sunk 9 inches (230 mm) due to the collapse of the I-580 connector onto the I-880 connector.[22]

A contractor with a proven track record of rebuilding damaged freeways (most notably the Santa Monica Freeway after the 1994 Northridge earthquake) well ahead of schedule, C. C. Myers, Inc., submitted a winning bid of $876,075 to repair the damage to the I-580 connector. The bid was estimated to cover only one-third of the cost of the work, but the firm counted on making up the shortfall with an incentive of $200,000 per day if the work was completed before June 27, 2007.[23]
On the evening of Thursday, May 24, the I-580 connector re-opened, just before the busy Memorial Day weekend. The deadline to finish the project was beaten by over a month, with the contractor earning the $5 million bonus for early completion.[24] The entire reconstruction project was completed only 26 days after the original accident.
A state projection concluded that the connector collapse had cost $90 million, based on a $6 million per day economic impact estimate. This includes a $491,000 loss in toll revenue for the Oakland Bay Bridge.[25]
On May 25, 2007, the CHP revoked the license for transporting hazardous materials from Sabek Transportation, the owner of the tank truck, after an investigation found 36 violations of its operations and equipment.[26]

In their statement, Barchi added they were the best of the 63 candidates interviewed for the job of succeeding Tim Pernetti. Hermann, 49, was hired on May 15 and is scheduled to officially to start at Rutgers on June 17.
Barchi's assurances came after the Newark Star-Ledger reported Saturday that Hermann quit as the head women's volleyball coach at Tennessee 16 years ago after all 15 of their players at the time, in a letter, accused them of calling them "whores, alcoholics and learning disabled."
"It's absolutely not true that I referred to them with any name calling like that," Hermann said Monday. "That's not part of my vocabulary.
"Am I an intense coach? Absolutely as many coaches are. There's a big canyon between being super intense and abuse. This was not an abusive environment. Was it challenging? Yes. It was incredibly challenging. Was I aware players were unhappy? I was unaware by the end of the season. We had so many challenges with this group of women."
According to the Star-Ledger report, Hermann was confronted by players, who piled into an office -- some sitting on the floor and others sitting on a black leather couch. After hearing their complaints, according to the report, Hermann said they didn't want to coach the team anymore.
The players were not named in the report; however, one, Abbey Watkins, who played for Tennessee as Abbey Blazer from 1995-96, responded to the denials of mistreatment.
"I write this in response to make sure that the pain that we went through as a team is validated," Watkins wrote in an email Monday to ESPN.com's Andy Katz. "All of the things that were written are unfortunately true. Many of these things happened to me personally. I truly hope that Julie has changed but refuse for anyone to deny the fact that our dreams had been crushed and our hearts broken."
"I pray that each of my teammates are happy and well despite what we went through," Watkins continued in the email. "I was the first player to speak at the meeting with my team, Julie, Kim and Joan. I said that they had made me hate the game I loved. For them or anyone else in the room to say that meeting didn't happen is appalling. I will never be able to get that day (and yes those black leather couches) out of my head."
Hermann said since the allegations were reported they have not contacted any former players and they have not contacted them However, Hermann said Amy Buchanan and Kelly Hanlon Dow, two former players, sent their emails a few years ago when they were an assistant athletic director at Louisville.
"They sent me notes," Hermann said, "saying 'glad you're doing well. Life is good.' They just wanted to say hey."
Despite the supportive e-mails that Hermann said they received from Buchanan and Hanlon Dow, both women painted a different picture to the Star-Ledger.
Buchanan said in the first set of a match in 1994 at Tennessee, Hermann glared at Buchanan in a huddle.
"She looked at me and said, 'What about you Buchanan?" they told the newspaper. "Are you going to lose the whole match for us?' And they followed that up with a backhand to my gut."
Dow, a sophomore of the 1996 team, told the Star-Ledger: "How ironic that Rutgers had an abusive coach and they're bringing in someone who was an abusive coach.'
Hermann said they were not asked by Rutgers search committee or Parker Executive Search, the search firm, about the allegations. Hermann said only the search firm asked them about a 1997 jury verdict that awarded $150,000 to a former assistant coach who said Hermann fired them because they became pregnant. Hermann says the assistant was fired because they were underperforming, and it had nothing to do with pregnancy.
Because of the allegations, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie plans to discuss the allegations with Rutgers officials this week, the Associated Press reported.
Other New Jersey political leaders have spoken out against Hermann and former Gov. Richard Codey believes Barchi should resign as the school's president.
Shortly after being introduced as Rutgers' athletic director, Julie Hermann was facing abuse allegations from their former volleyball players at Tennessee. U of L Card Game.com
Hermann said they understand the amount of attention this has drawn to Rutgers, which is reeling from the firing of basketball coach Mike Rice and the resignations of Pernetti, assistant coach Jimmy Martelli and interim senior vice president and university counsel John Wolf.
"I feel I have lived a life of integrity and operate with integrity, but I am not a perfect person," Hermann said. "I knew it (the job) would be tough."
Hermann said their initial reaction to the practice videos of Rice was "shocking. The same reaction as everyone else in America."
As Rutgers athletic director, Hermann said there is "an enormous amount of work for us to do" before Rutgers joins the Big Ten on July 1, 2014.
"It will involve a number of passionate people who care for Rutgers," Hermann said. "We all care about Rutgers. We want to assure our student-athletes have the best in class environment and academic support and the coaches have all the support they need.
"When we focus on that, then the people that care about Rutgers -- that what took place (with Rice) will never take place again. That's my sole focus. The chapter Rutgers had been through, where they clearly had an abusive coach, we never what them to be in an environment where they're in a place of disrespect."
New shot of Proxima Centauri, our nearest neighbour
Shining brightly in this Hubble image is our closest stellar neighbour: Proxima Centauri.
Proxima Centauri lies in the constellation of Centaurus (The Centaur), just over four light-years from Earth. Although it looks bright through the eye of Hubble, as you might expect from the nearest star to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri is not visible to the naked eye. Its average luminosity is very low, and it is quite small compared to other stars, at only about an eighth of the mass of the Sun.
However, on occasion, its brightness increases. Proxima is what is known as a “flare star”, meaning that convection processes within the star's body make it prone to random and dramatic changes in brightness. The convection processes not only trigger brilliant bursts of starlight but, combined with other factors, mean that Proxima Centauri is in for a very long life. Astronomers predict that this star will remain middle-aged — or a “main sequence” star in astronomical terms — for another four trillion years, some 300 times the age of the current Universe.
These observations were taken using Hubble's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). Proxima Centauri is actually part of a triple star system — its two companions, Alpha Centauri A and B, lie out of frame.
Although by cosmic standards it is a close neighbour, Proxima Centauri remains a point-like object even using Hubble's eagle-eyed vision, hinting at the vast scale of the Universe around us.
In the private sector, at least, companies that are inclined to do so could simply change their drug testing policies, but those that receive federal contracts are required to prohibit the use of marijuana as a condition of participation under the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988.
The federalDepartment of Transportation also issued new guidelineslast year that prohibit the use of medical marijuana for transportation workers in safety-sensitive jobs including pilots, school bus drivers, truck drivers, subway operators, ship captains, and transit fire-armed security, even in states where it is legal.
And employers in all sectors have a “general duty” to provide a safe work environment under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, which some suggest is reason enough to terminate workers who test positive for THC.
Then, of course, there's liability to consider.
Say an employee comes to work under the influence (of any substance) and gets into a car accident or makes a critical mistake with a customer. It's the employer who gets sued.
"It really boils down to this: An employer's right to maintain a drug-free workplace is critical," says Denise Davis, a spokesperson for the California Chamber of Commerce. "It protects the safety of all workers and limits exposure to potentially costly litigation."
The Law: A Moving Target
The landmark 2008 Supreme Court ruling in California, involving a systems administrator who was fired by Sacramento-based RagingWire Telecommunication(now known as RagingWire Enterprise Soutions) for using medical marijuana, offers the most definitive guidance for employers thus far.
The court ruled that drug testing in the state was legal, that firing an employee for use of medical marijuana was not tantamount to discrimination and that employers are not obligated to accommodate the use of medical marijuana—even outside the workplace.
In other words, while the state's medical marijuana laws protect patients from criminal prosecution, it provides no protection on the job.
After all, pot remains classified as an illegal substance under federal law.
“The California Supreme Court gave carte blanche for employers to discriminate against medical marijuana patients,” says Joe Elford, legal counsel for Americans for Safe Access, a medical marijuana advocacy group.
But the door remains open for less rigid interpretation.
At present, seven medical marijuana states have implicit employee protections in place, where the law mentions only on-the-job consumption or impairment as grounds for termination—Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and Vermont.
Two others, Rhode Island and Maine, have explicit protections for medical marijuana patients written into their legislation.
For example, the 2006 legislative bill that legalized the use of medical marijuana in Rhode Island states that “no school, employer or landlord may refuse to enroll, employ or lease to or otherwise penalize a person solely for their or their status as a cardholder” (of medical marijuana).
Thus far, however, none have been tested in court.
The blaze that killed 56 football fans at Bradford City's Valley Parade ground in 1985 was just one of at least nine fires at businesses owned by or associated with the club's then chairperson, according to extraordinary evidence published for the first time.
The Story of the Bradford Fire: ‘could any man really be as unlucky as Stafford Heginbotham?' Read more
The revelations are contained in a book written by Martin Fletcher, a Bradford fan who lost three generations of their family in the stadium fire. Fletcher believes the fire was not an accident and says they and their family are no longer willing to “live the myth”.
Fletcher managed to escape after the timber main stand at Valley Parade turned into a death trap during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on 11 May 1985. Their brother, Andrew, 11, was the youngest victim and their father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63, all perished. Martin Fletcher, who was 12 at the time, has spent the past 15 years investigating what happened and their book, Fifty-Six – The Story of the Bradford Fire, is published on Thursday 16 April.
The book, serialised by the Guardian today and tomorrow, reveals there had been at least eight other fires at business premises either owned by, or connected to, Stafford Heginbotham, Bradford's then-chairperson, in the previous 18 years, resulting in huge insurance claims. Fletcher does not make any direct allegations but they do believe Heginbotham's history with fires, resulting in payouts of around £27m in today's terms, warranted further investigation. “Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?” they ask.
The disaster at Valley Parade came at a time, according to Fletcher's evidence, when the business person was in desperate financial trouble, unable to pay their workforce beyond that month. Heginbotham had learned two days before the fire it would cost £2m to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford's promotion from the old Third Division that season. Yet this has never been reported and did not feature in the Popplewell Inquiry, chaired by the then high court judge Oliver Popplewell, which held its investigation only three weeks after the fire.

The inquiry heard only five days of testimony and concluded the fire was probably started by a match, a cigarette or pipe tobacco slipping through gaps in the floorboards on to litter that had built up over the previous 20 years. Fletcher does not accept that version and quotes a report by the Fire Research Station, a government-funded body, that “features of the Bradford fire required a detail of understanding greater than that presented to the formal inquiry”.
Fletcher's evidence was collected through months of painstaking research into Heginbotham's business history and by trawling 20 years of local newspaper reports into fires in the Bradford area.
The pattern began with a fire at a three-storey Bradford factory in May 1967 and continued on Good Friday 1968 with another fire at the premises of Genefoam, of which Heginbotham was the managing director. A firm Heginbotham had founded suffered a serious fire in 1970 before the Castle Mills building, owned by Heginbotham, had a fire in 1971. Further blazes followed at the Douglas Mills building, also owned by Heginbotham, in August and November 1977. In December that year there was a fire at the premises of Coronet Marketing, a subsidiary of Heginbotham's Tebro Toys. A further fire at the Douglas Mills building occurred in June 1981.

2) April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director Stafford Heginbotham, Cutler Heights Lane
3) August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham, in Wyke, Bradford
4) December 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills building, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham
5) August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building, Bradford
6) December 1977: fire at four-story Coronet Marketing factory, Leeds Road, Bradford. Coronet Marketing a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham
7) November 1977: fire with toxic fumes at Douglas Mills factory
8) June 1981: fire in plastics factory at Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills
Heginbotham died in 1995, aged 61, and was never prosecuted for the Valley Parade fire, despite the coroner later saying they had given serious consideration to bringing a charge of manslaughter. Bradford City had received three separate warnings about the potential fire risk, two from the Health and Safety Executive and another from the council, but did nothing. Fletcher's book reveals how Heginbotham initially denied seeing the council's letter before repeatedly changing their story when it became clear this was not true. The author has told the Guardian it was a “litany of lies”.
Of Heginbotham's history with fires, Fletcher writes: “To quote a Los Angeles Police Department fire investigator in Blaze, the Forensics of Fire by Nicholas Faith: ‘It's rare to have a coincidence. If we start having multiple coincidences then it's not a coincidence.' It is clear to me that at Bradford, with Stafford Heginbotham in charge, there was a mountain of coincidence.”
Once dubbed “the bravest boy in Britain”, Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as wholly inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Their family expected a fuller investigation to follow and they say their determination to find out “the truth” stems initially from a conversation with their mother, Susan, when they were 21.
Martin Fletcher: ‘Maybe the reason I am here is to – finally – reveal the truth' Read more
“I never believed it was an accident and I never will,” they told him. “I don't think Stafford intended for people to die. But people did. All because they went back to the one thing they knew best that would get them out of trouble.”
When Susan Fletcher brought a civil case against the club and West Yorkshire county council, meaning 110 bereaved or injured people would have their compensation claims met, they received a series of anonymous late-night telephone calls, including death threats against Martin, then 14, and the warning “nobody beats Bradford City”. The grieving mother and son temporarily had to move out of their house to live in a hotel. Martin was taken out of school until it was considered safe to return.
Fletcher's book is released on 16 April, nine days before a minute's silence is held at every Premier League and Football League match to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary.
“I'm not living a lie any more,” Fletcher said. “I'm not living someone else's half-truth. I'm not living the myth. Bradford City on the day of the fire were sponsored by the council and across the shirt the slogan was ‘Bradford myth-breakers'. Well, there are a lot of myths that need to be broken.”
West Yorkshire police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire.
Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: “The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure.
“However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Them Majesty's coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.”
Vigo County ( VEE-goh or VY-goh) is a county located along the western border of the U.S. state of Indiana. According to the 2010 census, the population was 107,848.[1] The county seat is Terre Haute.[2]
Vigo County is included in the Terre Haute, Indiana, Metropolitan Statistical Area.
The county contains four incorporated settlements with a total population of nearly 63,000, as well as several unincorporated communities. It is divided into twelve townships which provide local services to the residents.[3]
The county is one of the best bellwether regions for voting in U.S. presidential elections; it has voted for the winning candidate in every election since 1956[4] and in all but two elections since 1888.[5] Only one county in the United States (Valencia County, New Mexico) has voted for the winning candidate longer.
History [ edit ]
Sullivan County was formed in 1817, and the area that later became Vigo County was part of it until 1818, when the county was created by an act of the Indiana General Assembly which took effect on February 1. Its borders changed several times; in 1821, part of the county was formed into Parke County, and later that year Putnam County was formed which also affected Vigo's borders. The final change came in 1873 when the present boundaries were defined.[6] The county is named in honor of Colonel Francis Vigo, of Italian heritage but a citizen of Spain due to residence in St. Louis.  They are credited with great assistance to George Rogers Clark both in financing Clark's exploration and American Revolutionary War efforts, and in service as an agent obtaining military information for Clark against British campaigns on the then frontier.[7]
Geography [ edit ]
Map of Vigo County
To the north of Vigo County, the Wabash River defines the boundary between Vermillion and Parke counties; the river then enters Vigo County and winds to the south-southwest, defining the southern portion of the county's western border before continuing south along Sullivan County's western border. Vigo County is thus the southernmost county in Indiana on the right bank of the Wabash. Clay County lies to the east. Across the state line are Edgar County to the northwest and Clark County to the southwest. According to the 2010 census, the county has a total area of 410.45 square miles (1,063.1 km2), of which 403.31 square miles (1,044.6 km2) (or 98.26%) is land and 7.14 square miles (18.5 km2) (or 1.74%) is water.[8]
In 1819, the year after the county was formed, it was divided into four townships: Honey Creek, Wabash, Harrison and Independence. Prairie Creek Township was formed later that year. In the following years more townships were formed and township borders were altered several times. Otter Creek, Raccoon and Sugar Creek townships were created in 1820, and Independence Township became known as Paris Township. Raccoon and Wabash townships became part of Parke County when it was split from Vigo County in 1821. Nevins and Riley were formed in 1822. In 1824, Paris Township was renamed again to Fayette Township. Pierson Township was created in 1829, then Lost Creek in 1831, then Linton in 1841 and finally Prairieton in 1857, for a total of twelve townships.[9]
There are four incorporated settlements within Vigo County. The largest, Terre Haute, has a population of almost 60,000 and covers all of Harrison Township and extends into several surrounding townships. West Terre Haute, as its name indicates, lies to the west, along U.S. Route 40; it has a population of about 2,300. The town of Seelyville lies to the east of Terre Haute, also along U.S. Route 40, with a population of about 1,200. The smallest town, Riley, is southeast of Terre Haute and has a population of only 160.

Highways [ edit ]
Interstate 70 passes through the southern part of Terre Haute from east to west on its way from Indianapolis to Saint Louis, Missouri;[10] U.S. Route 40 roughly parallels Interstate 70 and passes through the middle of the city.[11] Both highways intersect U.S. Route 41, coming from Chicago to the north;[12] U.S. Route 150 enters from Paris, Illinois to the northwest and joins U.S Route 41 in downtown Terre Haute, and both continue south toward Vincennes.[13]
(* SR 641 is currently under construction. Its current route begins at US 41 and ends at McDaniel Road.)
Rail [ edit ]
Several CSX Transportation railroad lines meet in Terre Haute; one enters from the north, another from the Indianapolis area, and another from Vincennes; and two others enter from Illinois. There is also an Indiana Rail Road line which runs southeast from Terre Haute toward Bedford.[14]
Airports [ edit ]
The following public-use airports are located in the county:[15]
Terre Haute International Airport (HUF) in Terre Haute
Sky King Airport (3I3) in North Terre Haute
Education [ edit ]
The public schools in the county are part of the Vigo County School Corporation. During the 2009–10 school year, the schools served a total of 16,014 students.[16]
Vigo County is served by the Vigo County Public Library.[17]
Colleges in Vigo County include Indiana State University and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. For a fuller list, see the List of schools in metropolitan Terre Haute.

In recent years, average temperatures in Terre Haute have ranged from a low of 18 °F (−8 °C) in January to a high of 87 °F (31 °C) in July, although a record low of −24 °F (−31 °C) was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of 104 °F (40 °C) was recorded in September 1954. Average monthly precipitation ranged from 2.13 inches (54 mm) in January to 4.46 inches (113 mm) in May.[18]
Government [ edit ]
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the Constitution of Indiana, and by the Indiana Code. The county council is the fiscal body of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.[19][20]
The executive and legislative body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the laws and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.[19][20]
The county maintains a small claims court that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level circuit court.[20]
The county has several other elected offices, including sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, recorder, surveyor, and circuit court clerk. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare party affiliations and to be residents of the county.[20]
Politics [ edit ]
The county is one of the best bellwether regions for voting U.S. presidential elections; it has voted for the winning candidate in every election since 1956[4] and in all but two elections since 1888 (1908 and 1952).[5] The results in the county have largely mirrored the nationwide popular vote. In every presidential election from 1960 to 2012, the county voted less than five percentage points from the national result. This changed in 2016, when the county voted nine percentage points more Republican than the nation as a whole.
In statewide races for governor and the U.S. Senate, Vigo County has in recent years become more receptive to candidates from the Democratic Party, even when the county had simultaneously voted for a Republican presidential victor in question. The county has gone Democratic in 9 of the last 10 gubernatorial races since 1980, and in 8 of the last 13 Senate races since that year also.
Vigo is part of Indiana's 8th congressional district, which is held by Republican Larry Bucshon.

Malaysian transgender activist Nisha Ayub receives the US Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award. ― Screengrab from the US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur's Twitter account
KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 — The Malaysian AIDS Council (MAC) expressed hope today that local transgender activist Nisha Ayub's win of a US government award for courage would lead to better understanding of trans-people who are disproportionately affected by HIV.
MAC president Datuk Dr Raj Karim said discrimination against transgenders affects their access to HIV treatment, noting that HIV prevalence among the community is 14 times higher than the general population.
“We are extremely proud of what Nisha has accomplished in seeking fair and just treatment for, and challenging public's negative views, perceptions and stereotypes of transgender people,” Raj said in a statement.
“We hope that this recognition will pave the way for greater understanding of transgender issues and ultimately improved health and social outcomes for transgender people. We wish Nisha continued success in their future endeavours,” they added.
Nisha won the 2016 US Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award last Tuesday, the first trans-woman to win the award in its 10-year history.
Nisha ― who co-founded two transgender rights NGOs, the SEED Foundation and Justice for Sisters ― told Malay Mail Online that they hoped the Malaysian government would recognise the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and called for equal rights.
Tulsa, Oklahoma (CNN) For years, the Jabara family says, their Tulsa neighbor terrorized them.
They called them names -- "dirty Arabs," "filthy Lebanese," they said.
They hurled racial epithets at those who came to work on their lawns, they alleged.
They ran Haifa Jabara over with their car and went to court for it.
And it all came to a head last week when the man, Stanley Vernon Majors, walked up to the front steps of the family home and shot and killed Khalid Jabara, police said.
"The frustration that we continue to see anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, xenophobic rhetoric and hate speech has unfortunately led up to a tragedy like this," it said.
Tense times
These are tense times for Muslim-Americans -- and those perceived to be Muslims. (The Jabaras are Christians of Lebanese descent.)
Khalid Jabara
Ever since the Paris attacks, carried out by extremists hiding behind religion, xenophobic bile has poured out. Then came San Bernardino, and after it anti-Muslim rhetoric from the Trump campaign, and a steady stream of hateful incidents came rolling in
What makes the Jabara case stand out is authorities had several opportunities to intervene, but appeared to have bungled, the family believes.
"This is troubling at any time, but profoundly disturbing given the current climate of our country and the increase nationally in cases of hate crimes," the family said.
Deep roots in Tulsa
Khalid Jabara's parents immigrated to the United States in the early 1980s from Lebanon.
They settled in Tulsa and raised three children. One brother became a lawyer, the sister works in marketing, and Khalid Jabara ran the family catering business with their mother.
Khalid Jabara was the superstar of the family, said their younger brother, Rami Jabara.
They excelled at everything: they could sing, they were athletic, they were good at basketball and computers, you name it, the brother said.
"I know my brother had not an ounce of anger. They were giving, generous. He'd give away their last couple bucks to anybody. They just wanted to be around family," they said.
The Jabara family moved into their current home 12 years ago. A few years later, Stanley Majors moved into the house next door.
Long history of complaints
The harassment and intimidation began almost immediately, they say.
Stanley Vernon Majors
"He'd call us names all the time. 'You dirty Arabs, get out of here,'" the mother, Haifa Jabara, told CNN.
"I had a guy who mowed our lawn, he's black. He'd scream, 'You N-word, get out of here."
Neighbors lodged several complaints with police against Majors over their behavior.
And in 2013, the family filed a protective order, which forbade Majors from having any contact with the Jabaras.
It didn't make a difference.
"Every time I came outside at night, he'd scream and yell at me. Scared me to death," Jabara said.
Attack while awaiting trial
In 2015, Haifa Jabara says they were taking a walk in the neighborhood when Majors ran them over with their car.
"He came from the back and hit me hard," they said. "I fell on the floor, bloody, bleeding from my head. A lady was passing by, called 911 and rescued me," they said.
They spent weeks in the hospital with a broken shoulder, collapsed lung and fractured ribs, among other injuries.
Police charged Majors with felony assault. Initially, they were held in custody without bond. But three months ago, against the district attorney's wishes, a judge allowed their release until their trial in March 2017.
"We can't help but question, could things have ended differently?" said Jenna Jabara, the victim's sister-in-law.
"If police had made contact with him, stuck around a little longer, if they hadn't been out on bond, if there had been more questions before bond."
'How many red flags does it take?'
The Jabaras said they lived in fear, and considered moving, but the parents are not that mobile.
"My dad is on a feeding tube and has a walker, it's not like we can just pick up and move," Rami Jabara said.
Instead, the family let the district attorney know about their fears,
"We did constantly communicate with the DA. After they were released, I told them, 'This is not gonna be good. I fear that something might happen,'" they said. "How many red flags does it take?"
Freed on bond
Despite protests, Majors was freed.
Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said Majors was an "obvious public safety risk and we made that argument to the court."
"The family did everything they were supposed to do and the system failed them," they said.
The family can't understand why a judge would release them without conditions -- without an ankle monitor, for instance.
"We ca'nt help but question, could things have ended differently?" Jenna Jabara said.
Majors' lawyer, Marvin Lizama, said the man had been in good spirits since their release.
"I don't know what happened last week that could have changed that," they told CNN.
"Never did I expect Mr. Majors to do something like this. This was unexpected and unfortunate."
The night of the slaying
The family feared the harassment would just escalate.
On Friday, the night of their slaying, Khalid Jabara called to tell their mother not to come home because Majors had a gun.
Officers arrived on scene but they couldn't go inside Major's home to check, so they left, said police spokesperson Ashley Leland.
About 10 minutes later, Khalid Jabara was shot while they were on the phone with their mother.
"She heard what no one should ever have to hear," Abou-Chedid said.
Khalid Jabara died at the hospital.
After the shooting, officers found Majors hiding behind a tree at a library.
They have been arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder. And this time, he's being held without bail.
The only Hebrew language teacher who holds a position in Indian academia is Dr Khurshid Imam, Assistant Professor at the School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies in Jawaharlal Nehru University. In this conversation with Dr Navras Jaat Aafreedi, they reveal the secret of a Ben Gurion "mosque" and tells us about a hadīth in which Prophet Muhammad encouraged Muslims to learn Hebrew.
Please correct me if I am wrong in understanding that you are the only person teaching Hebrew at any Indian university?
Not only am I the only person teaching Hebrew at any Indian university, but I was also instrumental in getting Hebrew introduced at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. Although officially speaking it was introduced at the university only as a result of a bilateral agreement between India and Israel, yet had I not made efforts for it, I doubt if this had happened when it happened. (This interview was conducted in 2011. Since then, Dr Imam has been joined by Achia Anzi in teaching Hebrew at JNU, but Anzi teaches on a contractual basis. Hence, Imam still remains the only Hebrew teacher to hold a tenure track position in Indian academia.)
There are two divisions in any religious community, one of the observant followers and the other of the non-observant ones. You clearly belong to the observant section of Muslims. Considering this and given the tensions between Jews and Muslims today, it is surprising to come across you, an observant Muslim, as the only Hebrew teacher in India. Although Islam does not forbid learning any language, it is hard to find somebody like you.
It is only because of the stereotyping of Muslims that people are surprised when they find me teaching Hebrew. Stereotyping can have very dangerous ramifications as witnessed in the post-9/11 fatal attacks on Sikhs in the US when they were mistaken for Muslims because of their beards and turbans. Also, generally Muslims know their religion not as a result of self-study but as a consequence of how it is interpreted to them by the clerics, which shapes their understanding of how a Muslim should conduct himself. Hence, they are often suspicious of those among them who study the Torah or have Jewish friends.
Similarly, instead of appreciating a Muslim studying the Hebrew language in which one of the most important sacred texts, the Torah, was received, it is seen with suspicion and even condemned. There was a time when the Indian Muslims had a similar attitude towards English, then seen by them as a language of the imperialists and enemies of Islam which would distance the Muslims from their religion, Islam. But today not only is English taught even in the Islamic seminaries, its importance is realised by one and all across the Indian Muslim community.
My family, friends and wider community were all surprised when I decided to learn Hebrew. Even in Israel, everybody seemed to be surprised to find a visibly observant Muslim like me with a beard and Islamic skull cap desirous of learning Hebrew. For the Israelis, it was their first ever interaction with a non-Arab Muslim, and that too an observant one and on top of that interested in learning their language, which took them by surprise. So, among both, Muslims and Jews, there were people who felt I had gone crazy. And I was met with this response only because of the stereotype of a Muslim that these people had. As for me, my interest in Hebrew was driven by my desire to learn about the Jewish version of the Middle East conflict, as my Jewish brethren expressed it in their language Hebrew. I could already access the Arab version in their language because of my knowledge of Arabic. I did not want to know about the conflict between the Jew and the Muslim through a third person.
During the time you spent in Israel for your studies, the consciousness that the people there would form their perception of Indian Muslims on the basis of their impression of you must have put some pressure on you?
It was after my MPhil at the Jawaharlal Nehru University that I went to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for some time for specialising in the Modern Middle East. Initially I went to Israel on a Government of Israel Scholarship, but after that I was supported by Golda Meir scholarship to continue my studies there. The various courses that I took under these two scholarships were cumulatively considered at par with MA.
Although lessons in Hebrew language are not a part of MA in Middle Eastern Studies, yet knowledge of Hebrew is considered mandatory for it. Hence, I learnt Hebrew along with my MA and attained knowledge equivalent to seven levels. I was in Israel from 1998 to 2000. I registered for PhD in 2002 and was awarded the degree of PhD in 2009. I was the first non-Arab Muslim that the Israelis had any interaction with. And they started trusting me so much that some of my Jewish friends even visited the Palestinian Authority-administered Bethlehem with me for the first time in spite of all apprehensions. I got invited to their homes on Jewish festivals just as I was invited by my Palestinian friends on Muslim festivals. My having relations with both parties sometimes made people suspicious of me. Palestinians would think of me as a Yemenite Jew while the Ashkenazim would consider me an Arab. Hence, I was under threat from both sides. In this respect, mere glares would say a lot to me even if the people did not utter a word.
When I tread on areas beyond the university neighbourhood, people would look at me with suspicion. Muslims would look at me in the same manner if I visited a mosque not accompanied by any local Arab Muslim friend. The very atmosphere is such that people get easily suspicious of strangers and fear them to be suicide bombers or fanatic attackers. Later, I started empathising with them. I used to offer namāz (Islamic prayers) in the balcony of my flat in Israel. The door to the balcony had a picture of [Israel's first prime minister] Davd Ben Gurion. I never thought of removing the picture, and as a result my flatmates started calling it Ben Gurion mosque.
Without exaggeration, at least 20-25 Jews wept when I left Israel. Relations are still such that whenever anybody from this university goes to Israel, they are asked about my well-being. I see it as an achievement that I left behind weeping Jewish friends when I returned to India, given the fact that I had gone to Israel all alone, despite discouragement from family and friends and their warnings that according to them, I, a devout Muslim, was risking my safety by heading to an enemy country. Later, Israeli TV channel, Channel 8 Avutz Shimoni, invited me to Israel for two weeks for an interview for a six or seven episode documentary series on identity.
How and when did you develop an interest in the Hebrew language?
Conscious as I was that there was more to the animosity and the tensions between Jews and Muslims than just the Arab-Israel conflict, I decided to interact with Jews in their own language to get to the very root of the problem. It was an attempt on my part to understand their outlook, their point of view, right from the horse's mouth, instead of being informed through the press, predominantly by the third party, which is neither Jewish nor Muslim.
Secondly,there is a hadith according to which Prophet Muhammad asked their followers to learn Hebrew. It is said that two of the sahābā attained command of Hebrew, one in thirteen days and the other in fifteen days. Hebrew of those times was very close to Arabic. By learning Hebrew, I also followed a sunnat, according to which one should learn as much as possible. My knowledge of Hebrew has also enabled me to bridge the communication gap between me as a Muslim and Jews. I also felt that with the increasing strengthening of relations between India and Israel, knowledge of Hebrew would brighten my career prospects. The first organisation to employ me upon my return to India was the Indian Defence School where I taught Hebrew. Even today, when I do not teach there any more I am still requested to come from time to time whenever there is anything involving the Indo-Israel defence deals. Hence, I have served my religion as well as my country by learning the Hebrew language.
What did you propose to study when you applied for the Government of Israel Scholarship?
I proposed to research the Role of Extremist Writers in the Peace Process.
After your return from Israel on the completion of your studies, did you face any opposition or resistance to your academic endeavours in India?
I am often called a Mossad agent who has been planted among Indian Muslims. Jawaharlal Nehru University is politically a very sensitive place given the dominance of the Left at the campus. It is the Left which is considered secular and it is anti-Israel. Hence, I could not expect any support from them. And as far as the Right is considered, even if they were sympathetic towards the cause of Hebrew, they were suspicious of me because of my religious Islamic demeanour. Therefore, of the two main political factions active at the university campus, I could not get support from either.
In this situation, it was not easy to introduce and promote Hebrew in the university and all I could do was to keep a low profile. Conscious of the fact that Muslims and Jews are seen as political adversaries, I urged the people to see my attempt to introduce Hebrew as a purely academic act, rather than driven by any political agenda. JNU is particularly known for the study of modern foreign languages. I tried to draw attention to the need for the introduction of classical languages and projected Hebrew as one. Introducing Hebrew in the garb of a classical language was the only strategy I could think of for countering the forces resisting it.
What I teach today is actually Modern Hebrew. I neither find myself qualified to teach the classical form nor is there any demand for it as the students are largely market-oriented and not research oriented. It is the knowledge of Modern Hebrew which would serve them better.
Could you, please, narrate a few interesting anecdotes or experiences of Israel.
When I got off the taxi at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem after my arrival in Israel, a heavy suitcase of mine, which did not even have wheels, was lifted for me for a long distance, until I reached my destination, by a stranger. It is interesting to note here that I had been cautioned against going to Israel by friends and family, and now my very first experience there was so pleasant.
Once a bomb explosion took place in the university library and the old librarian got injured. I also happened to be there. The librarian was so impressed with my gesture of immediately getting them water to drink and also with my washing their wounds, that after that incident they always introduced me to the people as the gentleman who came to their rescue immediately after the explosion. As a result of this and many other incidents, I got the happy feeling that I was positively contributing to Jewish-Muslim relations by leaving behind a positive image of Muslims, unlike the one the Jews had before. There were even articles on me in the Israeli press after this incident.
Before I went to Israel, I did not use to allow anyone to take pictures of me, but in Israel I was photographed so much that I stopped resisting.
One day, I was on my way to see a filmmaker who had interviewed me for a documentary they were making on Jihad. I had with me a book for him, titled Killing in the Name of God. Just when the bus arrived at the stop a police car stopped right in front of it after overtaking it and the police officers signalled to the driver not to open the door. With the pistols pointed at me, I was asked to raise my hands. After which I was asked to lift my shirt and then to open the bag. Upon my opening the bag came out that book, which made them all the more suspicious. However, I was let off when I showed them my University Identity Card. They explained that they did so because they had some input about a suicide bomber.
I would admit that I did have the same perception of Jews as common among the common Muslims, that they are a people guilty of the falsification of religious texts. It was after going there that I realised that the Jews were not any different and were regular, ordinary people like us, with good as well as bad among them. The Indian Muslims do not seem to be prepared as yet for greater interaction with Jews, for many among them have cancelled their visits to Israel out of fear of being ostracised by their community or instead of going there directly have gone there secretly via some other country.
The Urdu press does play a negative role in shaping the Muslim perceptions of Jews and Israel. I do not know where this misconception came from that the Muslims are not free to pray in the Al Aqsa mosque, but it is very widespread among them. It is silly of the Muslim countries to not grant visas to those who have been to Israel. Just as we Muslims resent being stereotyped, the same way, we Muslims too, should not stereotype the other communities.The Hebrew University of Jerusalem has a Department devoted to Islamic Studies. When the Jews can study about Islam and its history why cannot the Muslims study about Jewish theology and history and culture. It is necessary to understand the Jews in order to understand the Quran, which is full of references to Abraham, Moses, David and Solomon.
Dr Navras Jaat Aafreedi is an Indo-Judaic studies scholar and a Muslim-Jewish relations activist, employed as Assistant Professor in the Department of History & Civilization, School of Humanities & Social Sciences, Gautam Buddha University, Greater Noida.
This article first appeared on Cafe Dissensus.
Earlier this week, the folks at ComputerBild published a feature on tracks in Forza Motorsport 7. Featuring a discussion with Turn 10 Studios creative director Dan Greenawalt, the article pointed out the many cutting-edge systems that Turn 10 uses to bring the tracks to life with new weather scenarios and alternate times of day that literally cast the tracks of Forza Motorsport 7 in a brand-new light. If you haven't already done so, check out the article now.
Suzuka Circuit, Completely Rebuilt
It's one thing to read about the changes coming to tracks in Forza Motorsport 7 but it's a very different thing to see them for yourself. Suzuka is a prime example; like all of the real-world tracks in Forza Motorsport 7, Suzuka is officially licensed and completely rebuilt with High Res assets designed to look fantastic at native 4K and on the entire family of Xbox consoles. Not only is the track completely rebuilt and updated, Suzuka also features wet weather conditions for the first time in Forza history. Imagine tackling the “S Curves” at full speed, or barreling around the harrowing 130R, only this time battling the dynamic puddles that line the edges of the circuit, and the blinding spray of the cars in front of you. The same challenge that real-world drivers face at Suzuka lap-after-lap, will now be your challenge as well.
Returning Fan-Favorite, Maple Valley
I might be wrong, but I could swear I heard an audible gasp of excitement on the Interwebz back at E3 when we confirmed that Maple Valley would be returning with Forza Motorsport 7. Is there a more lauded, more beloved track in the Forza universe? Whether you're looking to test your sideways skills on one of Forza's best drifting tracks, or you want to push the edges of speed on its sweeping corners, Maple Valley is a masterpiece in every respect. Like Suzuka, it will also feature wet weather conditions as well – also a first in Forza history.
I want to make sure that you all understand what I mean when referring to conditions like weather and time of day. In Forza Motorsport 7, we've built tracks with a central goal in mind: Making every time you return to a track a unique experience. That goal manifests itself in a variety of ways.
Rapidly Changing Dynamic Weather
There's no such thing as a simple “rain” setting in Forza Motorsport 7. Not for Sebring or the Nürburgring, or Brands Hatch, or any other track where wet conditions are available. Instead, the team has created a system that can smoothly transition through multiple weather conditions per track, and those conditions can (and often will) change throughout a race. You might start off with gray skies and fog on a track like Sebring, only to find yourself in the middle of a thunderstorm two laps later. The lights might go green at Silverstone during a light rain, only to find drivers in dry conditions by the end of Lap 2. As in the real world, conditions change and sometimes change quickly, and its up to drivers to react to those changes.
Bringing Time of Day to Life
Those dynamic conditions extend to time of day too. Turn 10 is building on the sky technology that was first seen in Forza Horizon 3, capturing real skies that bring life, motion, and color to every track in the game. Check out the screenshot of the observation tower at the Circuit of the Americas against a darkening sky – one glance is all it takes to recognize a Texas sky at dusk. Even Laguna Seca – a track that has been in Forza Motorsport since the very first game; a track that all of us have driven hundreds, if not thousands of laps on – feels completely new in Forza Motorsport 7.
Whether you're talking time of day or the weather you're driving in, it all comes back to thatcentral goal: every race should feel unique. When you're playing through the Forza Driver's Cup single player campaign, you'll experience that first-hand. Take a race at a track like Silverstone as an example. Maybe the first time you play it, you'll battle the elements in a typical British downpour. Go back and revisit that same race in campaign, your conditions may be completely different; in fact, you may not encounter rain at all. The developers at Turn 10 have introduced probability into the various race conditions scenarios; meaning that there is a percentage chance that the weather conditions might (or might not) change. One race, things will go from bad to worse; the next time around, conditions might stay in your favor. It's that element of chance – and the need to prepare for whatever the race throws at you – that promises to make racing in Forza Motorsport 7 so exciting.
For me, weather and time of day are a game-changer. It will add the kind of variety and challenge that was only hinted at in previous versions of the game. The unpredictable conditions you drive in will affect your race more than ever before, and all of it runs at the rock-solid 60 fps that Forza Motorsport fans expect.
See below for all 32 tracks available to play in Forza Motorsport 7, and as always, stay tuned to ForzaMotorsport.net for more Forza Motorsport 7 goodness as we draw closer to launch, and don't forget to pre-order Ultimate Edition for early access on Sept. 29.

Now Palin's headlining (literally or figuratively, I'm not sure) the Republicans Governors Association conference.
Late Intervention Update: TPM Reader DH begs to differ: “I beg to differ about getting Palin off the center-stage of Republican leadership. The more they solidify their status in the GOP, the harder it will be for them to move the party towards a pragmatic, centrist image that attracts independent voters in congressional and presidential elections. The GOP is already defaulting to them That's good for Democratic candidates. ‘Palin 2012!'”
I quite agree from a partisan perspective. The more Palin the better. But I think we also need to think about this from the broader perspective of national dignity. And simple human decency. You're at a party and someone's drinking too much and starting to do embarrassing things. Even if you don't like them, and even if the unlovely part of you thinks it's kind of funny, still someone should step in. On the other hand, if Rush and Sean, are up for it, maybe we just tap another keg?
Feb 24, 2006 (MALAKAL) — A certain Mr Tombe was caught having an intimate relation with a goat belonging to a Mr Alifi at Hai Malakal — Upper Nile State, southern Sudan — on February 13. Tombe was ordered to pay the goat's dowry and take the animal as their wife .
Mr Alifi said: "It was around midnight when Tombe came to do their nonsense on my goat, and I was already in bed inside my house. Suddenly , I heard the goat make a loud noise. Immediately, I rushed outside to find Mr Tombe was naked and engaged in a relation with my goat . When I asked them what are you doing there, they fell off the back of the goat, so I captured and tied them up".
Alifi then brought some elders to decide the fate of the goat defiler.
"They said I should not take them to the police , but rather let them pay a dowry for my goat because they used it as their wife."
Mr Tombe agreed immediately to pay for the goat, and paid half the dowry 150,000 Sudanese dinars up front.
"We have given them the goat, and as far as we know , they are still together", Mr Alifi concluded.

"Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth" is a song by American rock band The Dandy Warhols. It was released in 1997 as the second single from their second studio album, ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down.
Background and content [ edit ]
As documented in the film Dig!, the song is dedicated to the band The Brian Jonestown Massacre, friends/rivals of The Dandy Warhols at the time, who in turn dedicated their own track "Not If You Were the Last Dandy on Earth" to them. Frontman Courtney Taylor-Taylor revealed in an interview that the song is also about their girlfriend at the time who, according to him, had become a heroin addict while they were on tour.[1]
The song is known for its refrain "I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so passé".[2] Because of this, the song has often been erroneously titled "Heroin Is So Passe" (most commonly without the accented e), although the song was later subtitled with this in some markets around the world.
Music video [ edit ]
The music video for the song, directed by David LaChapelle,[3] features the group "playing among a troupe of dancing syringes" and was called an "arch, playful, taboo-shredding hoot" by Mojo.[1]
Release [ edit ]
"Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth" was released in 1997 as the second single from ...The Dandy Warhols Come Down. It peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart and number 31 on the US Billboard Alternative Songs chart.

The American Center for Law and Justice sued the Justice Department on Wednesday to obtain more information about Attorney General Loretta Lynch's June meeting with former President Bill Clinton on the tarmac at an Arizona airport days before their agency dropped its investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email use.
"This Administration has gone out of its way to hide information from the American public — information that is extremely troubling," Jay Sekulow, the ACLJ's chief counsel said in announcing the lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act.
"The stakes are high," they added. "The American people deserve a Justice Department with integrity."
Lynch and Bill Clinton met June 27 aboard Lynch's private jet at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Clinton had delayed the departure of their flight in order to meet with Lynch.
On July 7, Lynch accepted the findings of FBI Director James Comey just two days prior.
While Comey said Clinton and their aides were "extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,” they said they were not recommending charges in the case.
Lynch's move effectively closed the investigation.
However, Comey told Congress last Friday they were probing emails had recently been discovered on a laptop shared by longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin and their estranged husband, Anthony Weiner.
The attorney general had insisted their meeting with Bill Clinton was social, but Republicans have long charged the session led to Lynch's decision to drop the probe.
"She has no business having any involvement in an FBI investigation of this magnitude," Sekulow said Wednesday.
In its FOIA lawsuit, the ACLJ is seeking all messages Lynch or their subordinates might have reviewed mentioning the tarmac meeting, names of Justice Department workers who might have discussed the meeting — as well as documents detailing conversations about news organizations regarding the fallout.

(CNN) - Republican presidential candidate Gary Johnson is trying to hold 'em - poker players, that is.
The former New Mexico governor's campaign website includes a "You're Getting a Raw Deal" page. On it, they pledge to support the card players' rights.
"The federal government should not be involved in restricting lawful commerce that doesn't harm anyone," Johnson wrote. "Support me for President, and I'll support your freedom. Get in the game, donate to the campaign."
To get in that game, players are asked to throw down $25, $50 or $100 (each donation is represented by a poker chip button).
PokerNews.com reported that Johnson is slated to attend the TwoPlusTwo.com World Series of Poker party Thursday night at the Wynn poker room in Las Vegas, Nevada.
"For a presidential candidate to actively recruit support from the poker-player constituency shows how much respect poker and poker players have gained in D.C. over the past five years, even if the status quo remains bleak," Poker News' Matthew Kredell wrote. "Even today, only a fringe candidate would go out on that ledge to court poker players. But for any candidate at all to see value in the poker vote is progress."
Johnson, a former business owner, is polling in the low single digit support in several nationwide polls since announcing their bid on April 21.
​Spurs are reportedly set to activate the release clause of Portuguese star right-back Ricardo Pereira, which is believed to be around €25m. The defender played a key role in Nice's impressive showing in France's Ligue 1 last season, on-loan from Portuguese giants FC Porto.
According to reports by sabado.pt, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is preparing themselves for the departure of England international Kyle Walker, who is thought to be a main target of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola this summer.
Pereira has reportedly greatly impressed Pochettino this season, who believes that their wing-back abilities can match those of Walker.
The 23-year-old is capable of playing both as an attacking wing-back and a wide-midfielder, which makes them an attractive prospect to Pochettino.
Pereira made 30 appearances for Nice last season, impressing greatly in their side's third placed finish in Ligue Un. Porto may well rue setting their release clause at €25m, which is a relatively low fee for a player of their quality.
Pereira fell out of favour at Porto, who prefer the services of their namesake Maxi Pereira, now 33-years of age.
If Porto does not rate the player as a suitable successor to the veteran right-back, then Spurs may well find themselves with a bargain replacement for Walker, should they decide to leave the north London side eight seasons after joining them from Sheffield United in 2009.
Pochettino's apparent interest in Pereira may well lead fans to conclude that Walker's time with Spurs is coming to an end.
Paris Saint-Germain are also believed to have expressed an interest in the talented right-back, who has built up a reputation as a highly-talented player among a host of fellow English stars at White Hart Lane.
Breaking up this contingent of English players could prove costly to the international team, who have arguably benefitted from the progressive cohesion of having Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Eric Dier and Danny Rose, as well as Walker, playing alongside each-other for both club and country.
Spurs Fans: If you had to sell one of these key players who would it be? Christian Eriksen Dele Alli Harry Kane Hugo Lloris Mousa Dembélé Toby Alderweireld

Content distribution is hard. You want to keep enough of it close enough to favorite customers so they don't have to wait and reduce latency for new data. That's why WICASTR created the SMART Edge Platform, a system for sending content to the very edges of the network, including compatible local routers and access points.
“WICASTR is an ‘all in one solution' for edge computing,” said founder Armine Saidi. “We are like Android ecosystem but for access points, routers and other edge devices: we have hardware, operating system and app store solutions to develop or deploy applications at the extreme edge with a simple 1-click solution.”
The company raised $1 million and went through TechStars. Their edge platform was inspired by the events of the Arab Spring. The founders wanted to create a system that would sustain damage caused by governments trying to shut down networks.
“The team embarked on a mission to create technology to facilitate seamless and uninterrupted communications and content distribution via all smart devices in the event of deliberate mobile network shutdown by governments,” said Saidi. This means devices on the network can act as content providers, thereby ensuring data can't go down during an attack.
The team has been together for seven years and they have “deep domain expertise in IoT, wireless, software, hardware development, manufacturing and distribution.” They've launched with over 20 paying clients and work with Intel, Cisco, and Deutsche Telekom to build out powerful edge delivery.

Arkham Horror: The Card Game recently made its way to retailers, and fans everywhere have begun to delve its secrets, discovering the many ways in which it subverts the traditional card gaming experience with the insidious freedoms, characterizations, and narrative frameworks of a roleplaying game. The result is that you don't just manipulate cards as you play, but you slowly slip deeper into the game itself. You become your investigator, and you jump whenever you hear the telltale clatter of footsteps rounding the corner of a dark, cobblestone alleyway.
The game goes to great lengths to help you experience each adventure from your investigator's point of view. Its graphic design evokes the styles of the 1920s. Its artwork is framed to force the most terrifying elements of your challenges immediately into your view. And you can only explore those locations where your investigator has traveled. Most of all, you share your investigator's limitations. You can only hold two items that require a free hand. You can only wear one body's worth of gear. You can only focus on so many arcane secrets at the same time. And you have your flaws.
As enjoyable as it can be in a customizable card game to craft the perfect deck, people aren't perfect, and the Arkham LCG® acknowledges this through the weaknesses it forces you to build into your deck. Of course, these weaknesses might very well surface at the most inopportune of moments. They might even transform your imminent victory into a tragic defeat. But that's part of the beauty of the game. That's part of what makes it a terrifying, Lovecraftian experience. That's very much near the center of all that makes the game an Arkham Horror Files game.
Because we believe that the weaknesses of the Arkham LCG are such an integral part of its experience, we offer you, today, one of the strangest previews you're likely to see in the world of card gaming. Instead of focusing on all the ways that the new player cards from the upcoming The Dunwich Legacy deluxe expansion can enhance your deck, we're going to look at some of the horrifying misery and tragedy your characters can expect to confront.
The Character Flaws of The Dunwich Legacy
Like the investigators from the Core Set, the five investigators from The Dunwich Horror each come with two signature cards—one of which will be a beneficial asset or event, and the other of which will be a weakness. In the Arkham LCG, these cards represent a good deal of who you are as an investigator.
For example, if you happen to be playing as Rex Murphy, you'll be investigating the game's strange phenomena as the hard-luck reporter whose evidence keeps disappearing before they can finalize their stories. Rex's Curse (The Dunwich Legacy, 9) reflects this streak of strange bad luck by forcing to watch your chaos tokens slip away from you. True, you might be able to succeed at your skill test even after you reveal the second chaos token, but if you do, you know your Curse will still be in play for the next one. Eventually, it's going to catch up to you.
Fortunately, if the threat of having to overcome your bad luck time and again doesn't appeal to you, there are other investigators you can choose to play, including musician Jim Culver, who almost never has to deal with their signature weakness— Final Rhapsody (The Dunwich Legacy, 13)—more than once per game. On the other hand, Jim's weakness can deal a significant amount of damage and horror, especially when the chaos bag has lots of skull tokens in it. In a situation where all four skull tokens are in the chaos bag, it can potentially deal as much as five damage and five horror!
When you play as Jim Culver, you'll likely be conducting your investigations in the shadows of dread and with an appropriately keen sense of your own mortality.
Jenny Barnes doesn't run any risk of dying as a result of drawing their weakness, Searching for Izzie (The Dunwich Legacy, 11). However, there's a very real chance that their sister's disappearance will haunt them throughout their investigations, and she'll need to pursue every lead they can find to their sister's whereabouts. If Jenny doesn't consistently take action so that they can console themselves with the fact that they did all they could, their sense of loss may ultimately get the better of her, driving them to despair and madness. And although it may prove relatively easy to spend the two actions to investigate the location where you attach Searching for Izzie, it's the fact that the card always attached to the location furthest from you that's truly maddening.
This is especially true if you're nearing the final location in an adventure like The Gathering. After you've battled ghouls and braved supernatural terrors just to gain access to your Parlor, you won't necessarily want to tangle any longer than necessary with the Ghoul Priest (Core Set, 116) in your house, just to make sure you hadn't overlooked any clues about Izzie's disappearance that you might have left in your nearly unrecognizable Cellar. Instead, when Searching for Izzie appears in the thick of your battle with the Ghoul Priest and attaches to the Cellar, it's almost a guarantee that you'll suffer a point of mental trauma that you'll carry with you for the rest of your campaign.
Whether you have a recurring weakness like Rex Murphy's, a dangerously potent drop-kick to the gut like Jim Culver's weakness, or a weakness like Searching for Izzy that wants to send you racing in the wrong direction during your adventures—the truth is that it's never good to draw your investigator's weakness at a critical moment. However, it helps to be aware of these flaws, just as it helps to be aware of our character flaws in real life.
As Rex Murphy, you might try to offset your bad luck Curse with a little help from a Rabbit's Foot (Core Set, 75), so that even should your bad luck cause you to fail at a check, you might still gain something from the encounter.
with a little help from a Rabbit's Foot (Core Set, 75), so that even should your bad luck cause you to fail at a check, you might still gain something from the encounter. As Jim Culver, you might add a copy or two of Scrying (Core Set, 61) to your deck and use it whenever your health or sanity are at risk should you hear the Final Rhapsody.
And as Jenny Barnes, you might do well to stock your deck with some cards that facilitate quick movement, such as Elusive (Core Set, 50) and Shortcut (The Dunwich Legacy, 22).
In the end, the Arkham LCG is notable not just for the way it lets you manipulate this puzzle built of cards. Unlike the myriad customizable card games that challenge you to find answers among your cards to the cards that your opponents play, the Arkham LCG isn't even just about "winning." The Arkham LCG is about adventure, and your weaknesses play a critical role in your experience of the adventures you undertake. You can't expect your deck will only give you good things; there's always a chance that things can go horribly, horribly wrong.
Who Will You Become?
Like Zoey Samaras (The Dunwich Legacy, 1), whom we've seen earlier, each of the five investigators from The Dunwich Legacy features one primary class, then allows you to dabble with level zero cards from all the other classes. How will you use these cards? Will you use them to play to your strengths, or will you use them to mitigate your personal weaknesses? Who will you become?

A female American Bald Eagle has been spotted incubating eggs in a nest in a Cook County forest preserve in Palos Township and officials believe that the eaglets have recently hatched, officials announced today.
The eagle family was spotted in a Cottonwood tree in the Southwest suburb on Forest Preserve District of Cook County property according to officials with the forest preserve and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which announced the finding in a press release.
American Bald Eagles have been migrating through the Chicago area in larger numbers in recent years, and a number of bald eagle's nests have been found in the County in the past, officials said.
Officials believe this is the first hatching site that the public can see in more than a century.
“To have these American Bald Eagles, our county's national symbol, choose to nest and lay eggs here in Cook County is incredible news for our local residents, and indeed for our nation as a whole,” said Forest Preserve District of Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle.
It will be several weeks before the fledglings begin to learn to fly and make their way from the nest. The adult eagles will be hunting in the area to bring the hungry eaglets food, officials said.
If the nest is successful, the eagles are expected to remain in the nest for the summer season, eventually migrating further south in late autumn. Eagles generally return to the same nesting site each year.
“The fact that these eagles have returned to the area to nest demonstrates a healthy, diverse ecosystem in this area, and will have a positive impact on all of our wildlife,” Preckwinkle said in a statement.
The Cook County and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officails are taking steps to ensure the safety of this endangered species. Access to members of the public wishing to view the nest will be limited to approximately 500 yards in order to avoid disturbing the eagles. Forest Preserve District police will also be monitoring the site to ensure that all local, state and federal laws are followed.
According to the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, interfering with the nesting of bald eagles may result in a fine of at least $100,000, and up to a year in jail term for a first offense. Penalties increase for additional offenses, and a second violation of this Act becomes a felony.
The Forest Preserve District of Cook County will provide updates on the eagle through its website, www.fpdcc.com/baldeagles. People can also become fans of the District on Facebook and Twitter @fpdcc.

By John Stossel - December 28, 2011
As 2011 draws to a close, I wonder: Is freedom winning? Did America become freer this year? Less free? How about the rest of the world?
I'm a pessimist. I fear Thomas Jefferson was right when they said, "The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground." That's what's happened. Bush and Obama doubled spending and increased regulation. Government's intrusiveness is always more, never less. The state grows, and freedom declines.
But there were bright spots. We don't yet know what will become of what people call the Arab Spring. But this year, for the first time in my life, there was hope that masses of people in the Middle East will embrace liberalism -- in the original sense of people being left alone to pursue their own lives.
Another possible bright spot: President Obama declared the war in Iraq over. I don't believe it because 17,000 embassy personnel remain, but at least he's saying it, and troops have left. Some will also leave Afghanistan. But I'm confused. Obama was elected partly because they promised to end the wars. But then they almost tripled the number of American soldiers in Afghanistan, from 35,000 to 100,000.
I'm pessimistic about America going bankrupt, like Greece, thanks to ballooning spending on entitlements like Medicare. But terms of debate can change quickly. This spring, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan presented a timid plan that would have slowed the growth of government slightly. Even Republicans went bonkers. Newt Gingrich called it "right-wing social engineering."
But now, just seven months later, the country's in a different place. Newt's apologized. Speaker John Boehner and other Republicans praise Ryan's plan. The Republican Study Committee wants to go further. Now Ryan agrees that their plan was "mild." Today they say he'd go farther.
Maybe attitudes changed because Americans watched the video of riots in Greece and realized what can happen when the money runs out. Maybe Standard and Poor's downgrading of the government's credit rating mattered. Maybe attitudes changed simply because the deficit numbers are so ugly that even the establishment has to acknowledge it.
But also, attitudes changed because we libertarians won the battle of ideas. Now every Republican presidential candidate -- not just Ron Paul -- talks about free enterprise.
Alec Baldwin told Occupy Wall Street demonstrators, "You can't have strong capital markets in this country or the country's going to go down the tubes."
Wow. Even left-wing celebrities defend "strong capital markets"? The world is moving toward limited government and free enterprise. We libertarians have won!
What am I talking about? We haven't won. Even Republicans want to grow government. When the Super Committee failed to reach its super conclusion and thereby put us on automatic pilot to a trillion dollars in spending cuts, Republicans screamed about draconian damage to the military. But the automatic cuts are really just cuts in the rate of increase. Spending will still go up, just at a slightly slower rate. Why is this even controversial?
I fear that much of the country is in agreement with the Wall Street protestors who love free stuff from government -- free health care, free college education, free lunch. Elderly Americans want no cuts to Medicare. Even after the Solyndra scandal, 62 percent of Americans say America should continue to invest in clean-energy jobs. Don't they think about what that money would be producing if left in the hands of free, entrepreneurial individuals? No.
Lots of Americans oppose free trade and free markets. It takes some knowledge to realize that the seeming chaos masks underlying order. The benefits of freedom are not intuitive, and when you go against people's intuition, they get upset.
The benefits of freedom are largely "unseen," as the 19th century French liberal Frederic Bastiat put it. They meant that rising living standards and labor-saving inventions don't appear to flow from freedom. But they do.
It's one of the ironies of life that people need not understand freedom for it to work, and because of this, there is the perennial danger that they will give it up without realizing the disastrous consequences that follow.
We freedom-lovers have a lot more work to do.
Winter is a sad time for fresh produce. Fresh berries and leafy greens are replaced by root vegetables -- piles and piles of them. While there's a lot to love about sweet potato, celery root and sunchokes, sometimes a person needs to taste something fresh. And that's why we're ever so grateful for the warm parts of the country -- we're looking at you Cali -- and all the citrus it shares with those of us living under heaps of snow.
Naval oranges, clementines and grapefruit, these are winter's saving graces. And it gets even better, with blood oranges.
Blood oranges taste just like regular oranges, only they're BEAUTIFUL. Their orangey-reddish skin hints to the bright garnet flesh that hides inside. While you can use them just as you would any other orange, we found just the recipes you need to show off how very lovely this citrus fruit is.
How Bots and Cyborgs Spread Misinformation: A Data Scientist Finds 5,000+ Bots in 72,000,000+ Tweets Related to Trump, Russia, and the NFL
Hackernoon Blocked Unblock Follow Dec 12, 2017
Particularly over the last several years, researchers across a spectrum of scientific disciplines have studied the dynamics of social media networks to understand how information propagates as the networks evolve. Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook include not only actual human users but also bots, or automated programs, that can significantly alter how certain messages are spread. While some information-gathering bots are beneficial or at least benign, it was made clear by the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and the 2017 elections in France that bots and sock puppet accounts (that is, numerous social accounts controlled by a single person) were effective in influencing political messaging and propagating misinformation on Twitter and Facebook. It is thus crucial to identify and classify social bots to combat the spread of misinformation and especially the propaganda of enemy states and violent extremist groups. This article is a brief summary of my recent bot detection research. It describes the techniques I applied and the results of identifying battling groups of viral bots and cyborgs that seek to sway opinions online.
For this research, I have applied techniques from complexity theory, especially information entropy, as well as network graph analysis and community detection algorithms to identify clusters of viral bots and cyborgs (human users who use software to automate and amplify their social posts) that differ from typical human users on Twitter and Facebook. I briefly explain these approaches below, so deep prior knowledge of these areas is not necessary. In addition to commercial bots focused on promoting click traffic, I discovered competing armies of pro-Trump and anti-Trump political bots and cyborgs. During August 2017, I found that anti-Trump bots were more successful than pro-Trump bots in spreading their messages. In contrast, during the NFL protest debates in September 2017, anti-NFL (and pro-Trump) bots and cyborgs achieved greater successes and virality than pro-NFL bots.
Obtaining Twitter source data
The data sets for my Twitter bot detection research consisted of ~60M tweets that mentioned the terms “Trump,” “Russia,” “FBI,” or “Comey”; the tweets were collected via the free Twitter public API in separate periods between May 2017 and September 2017. I have made the source tweet IDs as well as many of our analysis results files available in a data project published at data.world. Researchers who wish to collaborate on this project at data.worldshould send a request email to datapartners@paragonscience.com.
Detecting bots using information entropy
Information entropy is defined as the “the average amount of information produced by a probabilistic stochastic source of data.” As such, it is one effective way to quantify the amount of randomness within a data set. Because one can reasonably conjecture that actual humans are more complicated than automated programs, entropy can be a useful signal when one is attempting to identify bots, as has been done by a number of previous researchers. Of the recent research in social bot detection, particularly notable is the excellent work by groups of researchers from the University of California and Indiana University. Their “botornot” system uses a random forest machine learning model that incorporates 1,150 features derived from user account metadata, friend/follower data, network characteristics, temporal features, content and language features, and sentiment analysis.
For our current work, I elected to adopt a greatly simplified approach for social bot detection using two types of information entropy scores — one based on the distributions of time lags between successive posts and a second based on the ordering of words within the posts. Accounts that send messages at uniform time intervals or with messages with unusually static or similar text context might be bots or cyborgs.
Next, I calculated the Z-scores of both the timing entropy and text entropy. In the results presented here, I set a minimum threshold of 10 social posts by a user in order to analyze said user's posts, and then I applied a conservative threshold of 2.5 for the Z-score (that is, raw scores at or above 2.5 standard deviations above the mean) for either entropy metric in order to flag possible bots. By lowering the threshold I would, of course, detect more bots, but at the risk of false positives that might inadvertently flag actual human users as bots. In the future, I hope to calculate the ROC curve for my dual-entropy approach to characterize the tradeoffs between false positives and false negatives.
Measuring the virality of bots using the k-core decomposition
The k-core of a graph is a maximal subgraph in which each vertex has at least degree k. The coreness of a vertex is k if it belongs to the k-core but not to the (k+1)-core. The k-core decomposition is performed by recursively removing all the vertices (along with their respective edges) that have degrees less than k. Previous research has suggested that the k-core decomposition of a network can be very effective in identifying the individuals within a network who are best positioned to spread or share information. I used the k-core decomposition in 2016 to analyze more than 120M tweets related to the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections to identify the most influential users. For this bot detection research, I performed a k-core decomposition of the heterogeneous user/hashtag/URL Twitter networks for each day on which I collected samples between May and September 2017.
By combining our entropy scores with the corresponding coreness values, I was able to identify which bots or cyborgs (that is, humans who use specialized software to automate their social media posts) were most successful in prompting other users (some of which were also bots) to share or react to their posts, thus attaining positions closer to the center of the daily Twitter networks. (This k-core decomposition approach was used in a similar fashion by Bessi and Ferrara to measure the embeddedness of social bots.)
The 3-D scatter plot in Figure 1 shows clearly that the vast majority of the identified social bots are unsuccessful, remaining at the outer realms of the networks with low coreness values because no or few other users interact with them. Successful bots achieved higher coreness values because other users retweeted or replied to their posts. Normal human users (not shown) would be near the origin, and it is easy to discern that the higher the Z-score of either entropy metric, the less successful the bots become. This is most likely due to the fact that human users are readily able to recognize the bots' abnormal postings and thus do not tend to share those bots' posts. In summary, the more human-like the bot's behavior, the more likely it is that actual users will share that bot's posts.

Unsuccessful bots
The most extreme value of the text entropy Z-score (outside the plot boundaries) is 143 (with a raw text entropy of 1.0) for the Twitter user @says_k_to_trump. A few sample tweets are shown below. Note that every tweet is the single letter “k” sent in reply to each of @realDonaldTrump's tweets. That entropy Z-score reflects the fact that this user's tweets' contents are completely deterministic with no uncertainty. Understandably, no other user has interacted with @says_k_to_trump, so that bot has remained at the outermost edge of the network with a coreness of 1.

The most extreme value of the timing entropy Z-score is 122.7 for the Twitter user @trade_debate. Note the very uniform timing pattern of that user's tweets in Table 1. Starting with the second tweet, that user tweeted at a constant interval of two seconds.

Martin Shkreli
Turing Pharmaceuticals — the company headed by Millennial CEO Martin Shkreli — is preparing for a grilling before Congress, just as the company is seeking FDA approval to begin testing of a new epilepsy drug.
BuzzFeed reported that Shkreli — who jacked up the price of a drug prescribed to AIDS patients by 5,000 percent earlier this year — has engaged the services of high-powered legal and lobbying firm Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney to help make its case to legislators.
Shkreli has defended their decision to raise the cost of the anti-toxoplasmosis drug Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to $750 per pill by saying that the profits will pay for research into a new, better way to treat the parasitic infection.
Toxoplasmosis gondii is blood parasite that is mostly harmless to humans unless they are immune-compromised or still in utero. Daraprim is mainly prescribed to patients with HIV and active AIDS, pregnant women with toxoplasmosis and people with certain types of cancer.
On Sep. 21, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced that the House and Senate would be investigating Turing's practices and asked for extensive financial records regarding Turing's handling of Daraprim. The documents are to be handed over on Friday, Oct. 9.
Turing spokesperson Allan Ripp told BuzzFeed's Tamerra Griffin that the company is “preparing its responses” for any Congressional inquiries.
Ripp said representatives of Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney will be part of Turing's delegation before Congress.
“It's important to have very experienced veteran counsel on Capitol Hill,” Ripp said. “You can't go into those kinds of things without the proper sherpa.”
Shkreli has insisted repeatedly that patients who cannot afford Daraprim's new, prohibitive price can have their medicine covered by insurance or obtain it through charity.
Patient advocates have firmly negated that notion, saying that the consumer co-pay on Daraprim would inevitably skyrocket, leaving Medicaid patients and those on fixed incomes in the lurch.
Turing has since announced that it will not raise Daraprim's price to more than $700 per tablet, but that the drug will be more expensive going forward.
Ripp insisted that Shkreli and Turing aren't trying to hurt anyone by price-gouging on medications they cannot otherwise obtain.
“Shkreli wasn't trying to deny the drug to anyone nor squeeze people with limited budget,” Ripp said. “He's a save-the-world idealist as much as a profit-driven investor.”
In addition to preparing for their Congressional grilling, Shkreli is also apparently looking for love on Tinder. Writer Eve Peyser posted screen shots of a chat conversation they had with Shkreli in which they again defended their company's actions, saying that the media has scapegoated them for being “young and irreverent” and that “the media and the public don't want to look past a headline.”
[Ed. note: The BuzzFeed article featured in this piece originally indicated that Shkreli would be appearing before Congress on Friday. In fact, Oct. 9 is the deadline for Turing Pharmaceuticals to hand over all records relevant to the Daraprim price hike. Currently, there is no date set for Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceuticals' testimony. Raw Story apologizes for the error.]
Indian online retailers have been among the best paymasters over the last few years, but those employed in the sector may be in for a rude shock this appraisal season.
Last year, e-commerce companies had dolled out an average 10-30% hike. That may not happen this year, though, as venture capital (VC) funding gets harder to come and focus on profitability increases, human resource (HR) experts believe.
“Increments in the e-commerce sector will be on the lower side this year because these companies are currently under pressure to keep costs low,” CK Guruprasad, partner at Chicago-based HR firm Heidrick & Struggles, said. “It won't be a surprise if some smaller players don't give any increments at all.”
Most large Indian e-commerce companies, including Amazon India, Snapdeal and Paytm, roll out increments in April. Bengaluru-based Flipkart has two appraisal cycles—ending June and December.
Snapdeal said it would give its top performers an increment of about 20% this year. Last year, 20% was the company-wide average at Snapdeal. It did not share this year's average figure.
“Post Snapdeal's move to the trimester-based performance review system, we have strengthened our meritocracy focus. The increment roll-out for this year recognises top performers in the organisation and rewards them for their contribution in our growth journey,” Saurabh Nigam, vice-president, HR, Snapdeal, said.
Flipkart did not respond to our queries. Paytm said its increments will be “in line with” last year's. “People get paid based on their performance and ability to deliver,” Amit Sinha, vice-president at Paytm said. “If they are performing well, they will get superlative salary growth.”
The recent months have not been easy for India's e-commerce sector given the overall funding crunch, inflated valuations and new government regulations that may add to the troubles of some players.
The Indian e-commerce industry is currently valued at over $14 billion and has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 30% over the last few years, according to industry body Nasscom.
Yet, despite being in business for nearly a decade, most large e-commerce players are far from break-even. This is keeping investors away. Up to 46% of the participants in a recent study conducted by news publisher VCCircle said they were keen on investing in consumer service startups in India, but only 23% showed interest in e-commerce.
To make things worse, last month, investor Morgan Stanley devalued e-commerce posterboy Flipkart by 27% to $11 billion. Such a correction could mean bad news for the entire sector.
Source-based media reports have said that Flipkart is desperate for funding but isn't getting any at the valuation it desires. Its reported funding talks with Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba, failed due to the same.
In such an environment, it may not be the best move for e-commerce players to dole out high increments that will add to mounting costs.
“Giving big increments will give out a wrong signal to investors because they are expecting the companies to focus on lower costs, unit economics and break even,” Guruprasad of Heidrick & Struggles said.
Tight spot
In the last two years, the lure of fast growth and stock options has prompted thousands to give up cushy jobs at traditional businesses to join the e-commerce sector. These could be testing times for such professionals.
“Until last year, candidates could get about 50% increment when they jumped from one e-commerce startup to another within one year. Companies were hiring and poaching. That's not happening anymore. In fact, I see candidates who want to change jobs but they are either getting the same salary package or even lower pay,” Kris Lakshmikanth, chairperson and managing director at recruitment firm, The Head Hunters India, said.
Indian e-commerce companies frequently use stock options to attract talent. But with valuations under question, shares have become less attractive, Lakshmikanth said.
“The next 12-18 months will be the true test of those employed in the e-commerce sector. They got giant hikes and stock options when they joined. Now they have to prove whether they believe in the industry or not, and will they see this phase through,” Guruprasad said.
Do you believe in life after Ben Abraham? I hope you do, because it's time for This Week in Videogame Blogging!
As Ben wrote earlier in the week, I have taken on their role as the new senior editor of TWIVGB. Let's all give Ben another hearty round of thanks for the 2.5 years he's devoted to our little project and the fantastic things it's done for the discourse of game criticism and commentary. Then thank yourselves as well– because like always, these roundups could not exist without YOUR important contributions each week.
We start out this gorgeous Sunday with Kate Cox, who has been giving Dragon Age: Origins another try. Them the latest entry is a commentary on the sheer diversity of possible stories and the unexpected ways players are able to fill in the blanks in the game, referring in particular to their own noble character's class privilege.
Speaking of Dragon Age developers BioWare, Tadhg Kelly of What Games Are has a piece up on them as well, arguing that the RPG genre is defeated by its own emphasis on systems:
The roleplaying game profoundly struggles with its ambition toward art because its play is full of this sort of generalised mechanical play. It is pretty bad at evoking intended emotions within players (as Tolstoy would say it perhaps) because it's so busy being a giant accounting exercise. So supposedly significant moments in the narrative and the actions of gameplay are in conflict with one another.
In a similar vein of toolsets and systems, and just in time for the official release of Minecraft, Matthew Briet laments that the game is just too addictive for its own good. Elsewhere, brill.iam notes that a categorization system like the one we've set up for videogame genres unfairly impoverishes their expressive range. In particular they pose this scenario:
If SimCity had come out after Starcraft, would it be criticized for representing a city-building sandbox? Would it be panned for having no competitive multiplayer aspect? It is, after all, a strategic game (in fact, I would argue that the layers of strategy outclass those of most RTS games that came after it) and it plays out in real time. But RTS means one very specific thing now: little buildings that make little men that kill other little men faster than another person can make other little killing men. This concept of how representation should inform design is completely backwards.
And my old blogmate from Moving Pixels, Kirk Battle (aka LB Jeffries) is back again this week with a critique of Modern Warfare 3‘s dreaded on-rails structure keeping them from appreciating the game's littler details for their own craftsmanship: “Content Degradation”.
Keeping with our general theme of systems and the greater apparatus of game mechanics, Katy Myers has a lovely little article that is close to my heart: if graduate school is a competition, and most games are a competition, why not game grad school? It's an interesting, if depressing, notion, as Myers's numbered proposals feed right into conventional “incentivization” models typical of that much-maligned word “gamification”–which leads me to this next exciting piece from Tom Ewing, on de-gamification:
D&D has – as you'll know if you ever played it – a vast and hydra-headed system of rules. At first we would modify them, as almost all players did – dropping the ones that weren't fun. But eventually we abandoned the rules entirely, shifting to what used to be known as “freeform” gaming – something more like interactive storytelling. The reason we did this is that we'd reframed the aim of the activity to be creative rather than simply competitive or even co-operative. Once we'd done that, the game mechanics became a hindrance to play, rather than a spur. […] The implication of this is that once you have people who are confident with what they're doing and enjoy it, there may be something to be gained by degamifying their environments – handing over more responsibility and autonomy to the players, dialing down the rewards and rules structures you've put in place.
While Ewing caveats that this observation is based strongly on their own gaming experiences, the essay addresses many other good points, like the usefulness (or rather, the lack thereof) rewards for the seasoned player.
Over on Edge, a more industry-oriented article tackles the ethics of overpromoting a bad game–such as the one in its header image.
And Gameranx is offering up some truly quality work lately, with three stand-out articles all written by Critical Distance regulars. From Sebastian Wuepper, we have an examination of the American action game's fetishization of “big bads” like Nazis and Communists, arguing the latter has now succeeded the former as the FPS gamer faceless enemy du jour. From Rowan Kaiser is an essay comparing and contrasting the original Deus Ex with Human Revolution, arguing that HR is “a remake of a classic that has the rough edges shaved off for mass, not cult, consumption”. Finally, Brendan Keogh treats us to the virtues of grinding in Dark Souls.
We leave off with a glance back at one of the bigger “discussion” topics from the week, namely Kotaku Editorial Director Joel Johnson's controversial post defending the content of their fine publication. Mattie Brice (whose recent “Speaking in Accents” article is also a recommended read) led the pack with an open letter to Johnson at The Border House. This was followed up by Richard Goodness over at Second Quest, who criticizes the tone Brice takes and suggests instead that women and LGBTIQ gamers need to push harder for fair treatment and representation, citing the Women's Social and Political Union's motto, “Deeds, Not Words”. A third essay from Jenn Frank at Infinite Lives argues for the middle path between the two, concluding, “Kotaku cannot, will not, be a ‘safe space' tomorrow. And that's maybe the real point: Kotaku has always tried to maintain its finger on the pulse, and the fact that Kotaku is changing tells you things are changing.”
And that seems like enough meta to cap off one linklist! Enjoy your week, everyone. To my fellow Americans, have a happy and safe Thanksgiving. And for all of our readers around the world, thank you, as always, for your amazing support. Remember that you can submit your own links to us via Twitter or email! (Non-perishable food items only.

The Steelers have signed veteran punter Brian Moorman, Bob Labriola of Steelers Digest reported on Tuesday.
The 37-year-old Moorman was one of the best punters left in free agency. They will push Drew Butler for the Steelers' punting job. According to multiple reports, Moorman visited Pittsburgh on Monday.
Moorman had stints with the Cowboys and Bills — their long-time club — in 2012. The Cowboys picked up Moorman when Buffalo released them after a slow start. A two-time Pro Bowler and a member of the NFL's All-Decade team of the 2000s, Moorman's form improved in Dallas, where they posted a 38.9-yard net average in 12 games compared to just 32.7 yards net in three games for the Bills.
Drew Butler, the son of former NFL kicker Kevin Butler, recorded a 37.8-yard net average in 2012.
According to Labriola, the Steelers also waived wide receiver Bert Reed on Tuesday.

The Union Hotel
The Union Hotel[1] is a historic landmark located on Main Street in Flemington, New Jersey. It is a contributing property to the Flemington Historic District.
History [ edit ]
First constructed by Neal Hart in 1814, it served as a gathering place for well-to-do stagecoach passengers and socialites throughout the 19th Century, as well as many local characters and tourists visiting the area. The exterior of the present building dates to 1878.
It gained national notoriety in the early months of 1935 when the trial of Bruno Hauptmann was conducted directly across the street at the Hunterdon County Courthouse and members of the national media covering the trial all stayed at the hotel.
Decades later the property was purchased by new owners, renovated, restored, and converted into what is now officially known as the Union Hotel Restaurant. The second and third floors (which once housed hotel patrons) were left empty and unoccupied, adding to the growing mythos surrounding the widely recognized Hunterdon County icon.[2]
Murals created by Carl Ritz with the assistance of Kurt Wiese adorn the hotel. [3][4]
2008 closure [ edit ]
In July 2008, managing partner John Blanos announced that the Union Hotel Restaurant would sell its liquor license but remain open. However, in August they announced that the restaurant would close, and that the liquor license would be sold to Bensi, an Italian chain restaurant soon to open elsewhere in Flemington. At a special Flemington Borough Council meeting in September 2008, the transfer of the liquor license was rejected, but Blanos nonetheless stated that the restaurant would close immediately and that they were negotiating with a potential buyer. Blanos said that the Union Hotel had been steadily losing money since they and their partners bought it in 1999.[5]
Redevelopment [ edit ]
As of October 2012, the town had received four proposals to redevelop the hotel.[6][7]
In November 2012, the Flemington Borough Council selected Flemington Union Hotel LLC to revive and restore the once prominent Union Hotel on historic Main Street. Flemington Union Hotel LLC's principals Matt McPherson and Liam Burns envision to revive the Union Hotel as a 50- to 55-room hotel that would expand into the building next door at 78 Main St. The plan calls for adding a ballroom on the back and establishing an elegant steakhouse and a casual pub on the ground floor.[8] A special legislative bill is proposed to allow for a liquor license.[9][10][11][12] In February 2016 it was announced that the Union Hotel would be demolished and replaced with a new building on the site.[citation needed] This caused much controversy in and around Flemington,[13] and despite this controversy, the Flemington council approved the plans.[14]
In May 2017, plans to demolish the hotel were scuttled [15] and a new plan to utilize the building was introduced.[16]
Legends [ edit ]
The belief that the hotel was haunted is quite prevalent,[17] though few members of the public were ever allotted access to levels above the dining hall where a few rooms are used by management for business purposes and ghost sightings or poltergeist incidents have been reported by employees. One reported seeing a pair of shoes walk up a staircase all by themselves. Others have told of hearing or seeing small children in rooms despite the absence of hotel guests. The manager claimed to have felt an unseen presence in their office late one night when they knew they were all alone.[17]

The story of birth in a Bethlehem stable holds for many of us the transformational news that God has become one of us. John spoke of this moment as the Word becoming flesh and dwelling among us. The great wonder of this incarnational act is that the Creator entered this world not because the Creation clamored for deliverance, but because that creation was basically at war with its Creator. If one considers sin an act of war against God, one cannot help but wonder why God acted as God did through the incarnation of Christ. Certainly it would have made sense to find the Creator acting in retribution, punishing a sinful, rebellious creation, and yet, the Bethlehem story paints with broad strokes a very different picture.
John tells us that love motivated this story of incarnation; “for God so loved the world that They gave…”
Paul echoes this theme of God's uncommon love and humankind`s persistence in sin as they write in Romans 5:6-8, “You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. God demonstrates their own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (TNIV) This is what sets the Bethlehem story apart from any other birth…well, that and birth announcements delivered by an angelic choir, a caravan of itinerant Magi, and a virginal birth mother just to name a few. The baby Jesus was born into a world of anger, frustration, abuse, and despair. While many descendants of Israel were awaiting the coming of the Messiah, few, if any had looked to the humble birthplace of this baby nor expected them to later walk among them, calling them to repentance and a new way of living. The Christ did not come in human form, you see, to fulfill human expectation, but to fulfill a heavenly plan the likes of which no human mind could comprehend… “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”
Our world still struggles to understand this incarnation of God. Sin continues to wage war against the Creator, seen in places where integrity seems overcome by expediency, generosity by greed, peace by the violence of war, and innocence by the senseless devaluation of every life. From Wall Street to D.C., Afghanistan to North Korea, Columbine to Newtown, Connecticut, evidence of this struggle is played out again and again. And yet, Paul writes, “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” This is the good news of Bethlehem…love overcomes sin, light overcomes darkness, and life overcomes death.
The war still may seem to be waged all around us, and yet, according to scripture, the victory has already been won. Bethlehem has ensured that. And so, with Paul, we can say with hope and great expectation, “Thanks be to God who gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord.”

Image caption Three different versions of the painting were produced
A French scientist has revealed a major new discovery about one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous paintings, shedding new light on their techniques.
Engineer Pascal Cotte has spent three years using reflective light technology to analyse The Lady with an Ermine.
Until now, it was thought the 500-year-old painting had always included the ceremonial animal.
Mr Cotte has shown the artist painted one portrait without the ermine and two with different versions of the fur.
Leonardo experts have described the new findings as "thrilling" and said the discovery raises new questions about the painting's history.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Roya Nikkhah: "The history of Leonardo's masterpiece is now being rewritten"
The Lady with an Ermine is a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, a young woman in the Milanese court who was mistress to Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan.
'Changing their mind'
It is believed to have been painted between 1489 and 1490.
The Duke was Leonardo's main patron during their 18 years in the city, and they were nicknamed "the white ermine".
Image caption This red chalk drawing circa 1509 is widely accepted as a Leonardo self-portrait
Mr Cotte, who is a co-founder of Lumiere Technology in Paris, has pioneered a new technique called Layer Amplification Method (LAM).
It works by projecting a series of intense lights on to the painting. A camera then takes measurements of the lights' reflections and from those measurements, Mr Cotte is then able to analyse and reconstruct what has happened between the layers of the paint.
Following the discovery, new theories have now been applied to the well-known portrait, including a suggestion the artist may have introduced the ermine into the painting to symbolise Gallerani's lover, later enhancing the animal to flatter their patron.
Another theory is that Gallerani asked the artist to add the animal into the painting, so that the Milanese court was made fully aware of their relationship with the Duke.
Polish home
Mr Cotte said: "The LAM technique gives us the capability to peel the painting like an onion, removing the surface to see what's happening inside and behind the different layers of paint.
"We've discovered that Leonardo is always changing their mind. This is someone who hesitates - they erase things, they add things, they change their mind again and again."
Martin Kemp, Emeritus Professor of the History of Art at the University of Oxford, said: "What Pascal Cotte is revealing in France is remarkable.
"It tells us a lot more about the way Leonardo's mind worked when they were doing a painting. We know that they fiddled around a good deal at the beginning, but now we know that they kept fiddling around all the time and it helps explain why they had so much difficulty finishing paintings.
"Leonardo is endlessly fascinating, so getting this intimate insight into their mind is thrilling."
The painting belongs to the Czartoryski Foundation and is usually on display at the National Museum in Krakow, Poland. It is currently hanging in nearby Wawel Castle while the Museum undergoes renovation.
The Lady with an Ermine was one of the star attractions at the National Gallery's 2011 exhibition, Leonardo Da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan.
The painting has previously undergone several examinations using X-ray and infra-red analysis.
Criminals are once again using Java's cross-platform design to add Linux and Mac users to their usual Windows target list, Kaspersky Labs researchers have discovered.
The malicious Java application recently unearthed by the firm, HEUR:Backdoor.Java.Agent.a, is only the latest example of the opportunistic trend to use the huge potential of Java to get a malware three-for-one in the cause of turning systems into Distribued Denial of Service bots.
Once on the target system after hitting Java flaw CVE-2013-2465 (SE 7 Update 21 and earlier), patched last June, the malware sets up its command and control using IRC. According to Kaspersky, one of the targets on the receiving end of a DDoS attack might be an unnamed bulk email service.
It also deploys the Zelix Klassmaster obfuscator as a technique meant to frustrate analysis.
“In addition to obfuscating bytecode, Zelix encrypts string constants. Zelix generates a different key for each class—which means that in order to decrypt all the strings in the application, you have to analyze all the classes in order to find the decryption keys,” said Kaspersky Lab researcher, Anton Ivanov.
Familiar tactics
The cross-platform tactic isn't new and in truth it's hard to know whether the criminals behind it are more interested in attacking Linux and Macsa> or simply targeting Java's numerous vulnerabilities on the greatest number of systems. In December, DDoS malware targetting both Windows and Linux was reported by Poland's national CERT, albeit without the Java angle.
“Over the past year we have seen many samples of malware with different capabilities, some with DDoS abilities and automation through an IRC command and control,” said Barry Shteiman, director of security strategy at security firm Imperva.
“The choice of Java in this case does make the malware piece more modern. Java is multiplatform and therefore will allow the malware to run on more platforms. It may also use the fact that hackers are very focused on Java now for vulnerability research, so there is a likelihood that the malware can evolve with new ways to exploit and onboard a system,” they said.
This story, "Malicious Java app infects Mac, Linux systems with DDoS bot" was originally published by Techworld.com .
Oxford thief trapped by ‘pull' door they tried to push
THE state of Britain's criminal classes is lamentable. If we're not reading about Latvian muggers and Russian mafia, it's homegrown idiots. Take James Allan, 28, who on March 2 2012 held up the Martin McColl newsagents on Northcourt Road, Abingdon.
Allan, wearing a balaclava, threatened shop worker Angela Croke with a fake gun. They handed them £134.98. They fled. Or at least they would have done had they been able to get out of the shop. They got as far as the door. They pushed and they pushed and they pushed. But the thing would not budge. In frustration they ripped off their balaclava. They kicked at the door. They fell to the ground. And then Ms Croke pulled the door for him.
At court, Allan is sentenced to three years for the robbery and two years for possession of an imitation firearm.
The door to their sell has been set to “slide”. Their chances of escape are rated at nil.

Alex Jones analyzes a JP Morgan Chase ad that was in heavy rotation over the Thanksgiving holiday that is meant to sell the idea that the mega-bank is the backbone of America, when its reality, it is part of an enormous fraud.

Instead, the predatory institution, along with the other ‘Too Big to Fail' banks that received bailouts, have used corporate welfare to sellout the nation, ship jobs overseas, reap profits on money lent from the Federal Reserve at zero interest, while saddling huge debts upon the people through the larger derivatives scheme. The failure of the banks to lend to small businesses and ordinary Americans has been blamed for further stalling the economic crisis created by over-leveraging and derivatives on the global market.
JP Morgan Chase is at the heart of Rothschild and Rockefeller monetary interests; no wonder that its CEO Jamie Dimon sits on the New York Federal Reserve board of directors, while wealthy elites like Warren Buffett have called for them to replace Tim Geithner (another Fed insider) at the Treasury Department.

In 1580 A.D., the first Jesuit mission to the Mughal court gifted emperor Akbar with a copy of Plantyn's Royal Polyglot Bible. On receiving the Bible, Akbar reportedly “held them in their hands and publicly kissed them, and placed them on their head.” A Jesuit priest observed Akbar's behavior in following words:
Removing their cap or turban, kneeling on the ground with great devotion, they prayed before the picture of Christ and of the Virgin, venerating thrice, once in our manner, the other in that of the Muslims and the third in the Hindu fashion, that is to say, prostrate, saying that God should be adored with every form of adoration.

Three weeks ago, the Chicago White Sox had a six-game lead in the AL Central Division. They woke up Sunday in third place, listening to cries for manager Robin Ventura's head.
Ace Chris Sale wants that talk to stop.
Robin Ventura has watched the White Sox go from a big lead in the division to blowing leads and losing 14 of 18 games. Kamil Krzaczynski/USA TODAY Sports
"I don't think they gave up any runs," Sale said. "I don't think they made any errors, and he's in the dugout the whole time. It's on us to win games. I understand people -- I'll keep it that -- want to point fingers and find blame. But at the end of the day, it falls on the players. We have to find a way to turn it around. We're going to keep fighting. It will turn. We have too much morale, chemistry and too much talent. Just a rough patch."
The White Sox's struggles continued Monday against someone else who was feeling the heat. New York Mets starter Matt Harvey, who was 3-7 with a 6.08 ERA entering Monday's games, stymied the White Sox lineup in a 1-0 Mets victory.
There had been talk of dropping Harvey from the Mets' rotation, but they were dominant Monday, pitching seven scoreless innings while striking out six and walking just one batter.
The White Sox have now lost seven in a row and 15 of 19 games after a start that had people talking about an all-Chicago World Series against the red-hot Cubs.
What a rough patch it's been. On Sunday, Sale left after seven innings with a two-run lead. The Kansas City Royals scored three runs in the eighth to win.
White Sox closer David Robertson wasn't available because they had thrown 29 pitches while giving up six runs in Saturday's debacle. Chicago led 7-1 with one out in the bottom of the ninth before blowing that game.
That loss came after the White Sox led 5-2 in the seventh inning of the opener and ended up losing 7-5.
Ventura said all the right things Sunday when asked if they were feeling any added pressure.
"Not any more pressure than there already is," they said. "That's just part of the job, and you do it."
In total, Maryland has added 24 new taxes or fees in recent years, Change Maryland says. Florida, which has no income-tax, has been a large recipient of Maryland's exiled wealthy.
“Maryland has reached the point of diminishing returns. We're taxing people too much and people are voting with their feet," said Change Maryland Chairman Larry Hogan. “Until we change our focus from tax increases to increasing the tax base, more people are simply going to leave, leading to a downward spiral of raising revenues on fewer citizens."
The finding adds to the renewed debate over raising taxes on the wealthy. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie recently vetoed a millionaire's tax passed by their legislature, while California and other state governments are also considering higher taxes on high earners to fix budget problems. President Obama on Monday asked Congress to extend tax cuts for those making $250,000 or less – effectively increasing taxes for the higher earners.
Many contend that higher taxes drive out the highly mobile rich, who can simply move to a lower-tax state or even lower-tax country. Recent data shows that a record 1,800 Americans renounces their citizenship last year.
Some argue, however, that there is little real evidence that higher state taxes drive out large numbers of high earners. Neil Bergsman, director of the Maryland Budget and Tax Policy Institute, said while a number of people left the state between 2007 and 2010, others moved in. The net loss, they said, is “very small,” they said.
What's more, they point out that the wealthy usually move because of a job change, life change or retirement rather than taxes.
“There is no evidence that tax structures are a significant determinant in their location choices,” Bergsman said.
What's more, they said, Maryland is still minting high-earners and has among the highest incomes and highest concentration of millionaires in the country.
Other studies in New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island have also failed to offer proof that taxes are the main driver of out-migration by the top earners. (See here and here). In some states, weather is a bigger driver of out-migration by the wealthy than taxes.
Still, with top earners paying the largest share of taxes in many high-income states, many politicians don't want to take the risk of raising tax rates further.
Correction:
An earlier version of this story incorrectly said President Obama would ask Congress Monday to extend tax cuts for those making $250,000 or more. In fact, it was for those making $250,000 or less.

It's not your expected charity donation, as a box filled with ashes winds up at a Bellevue Salvation Army.
Marlene Moore had bought the box on Monday, but noticed it was heavy when they picked it up. When they opened it up, they found something very special inside, ashes.
The box had the faded name, Anderson, written on the bottom, and another one rubbed off so it was hard to make out what it said.
Moore was determined to find the owner. They took to social media, and hoped media coverage would find who the ashes belonged to.
“I would really love to find them because I know if it was one of my loved one I would want to fine them and get it back,” they said.
Fast forward a couple hours after talking with KMTV, “We found the owners, turns out it is not human remains, it is dog ashes,” said Moore.
After the Salvation Army heard about the box, they were able to track down where it came from. The original owner lives in Florida and had left their dog's ashes behind in a storage locker.
“I am really surprised that less than 24 hours we were able to find the original owners and be able to get it sent back home,” said Moore.
The Salvation Army said they are so glad Moore didn't just throw the ashes away and keep the box.
They said the owner can't wait to be reunited with their long lost best friend, who they had been looking for, for two years.
“Once they heard from us we had it and were willing to ship it back to them they were of course ecstatic and thrilled,” said Major Curtiss Hartley.
Moore said they are just amazed how everything worked out, “I am glad they are going back home.”
NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- State regulators closed Florida's First Priority Bank on Friday, marking the eighth bank failure of the year.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which was named the receiver of the failed bank by Florida state officials, entered into an agreement with Atlanta-based SunTrust Bank (STI, Fortune 500) to assume the insured deposits of First Priority.
All six branches of the Bradenton, Fla.-based bank will reopen on Monday as branches of SunTrust. First Priority depositors will automatically become depositors of SunTrust, the FDIC said.
First Priority had assets of $259 million and total deposits of $227 million, according to the FDIC. That includes $13 million in uninsured deposits held in approximately 840 accounts that potentially exceeded the federal insurance limits.
Account holders with more than the $100,000 insured limit will essentially "become a creditor" of the failed bank, said FDIC spokesperson Andrew Gray.
Those accounts will be credited as the FDIC sells more of the failed bank's assets, Gray said.
SunTrust Bank will purchase approximately $42 million of the failed First Priority's assets, which are made up of mainly cash, cash equivalents and securities.
And LNV Corp. of Plano, Texas, a subsidiary of Beal Bank Nevada, will purchase $14 million in First Priority's assets.
The remaining $171 million in assets will be sold by the FDIC. Proceeds of these sales will be used to pay creditors including bank clients whose accounts exceed the $100,000 limit.
Customers with accounts in excess of $100,000 should contact the FDIC toll free at 1-800-837-0215.
Correction: An earlier version of this story said the FDIC closed Florida's First priority Bank.The FDIC did not close the bank, the State of Florida closed it and named the FDIC as receiver.
At the University of Iowa, 20 percent of graduate TAs in fall 2015 served as the main instructors for undergraduate courses, according to U.S. News data. (University of Iowa)
The U.S. News Short List, separate from our overall rankings, is a regular series that magnifies individual data points in hopes of providing students and parents a way to find which undergraduate or graduate programs excel or have room to grow in specific areas. Be sure to explore The Short List: College, The Short List: Grad School and The Short List: Online Programs to find data that matter to you in your college or grad school search.
College students: Don't expect to always see a professor standing at the front of your classroom.
At some research universities, a teaching assistant – usually a graduate student – might either serve as the main instructor for an undergraduate course or provide support to the professor. There were 121,120 graduate teaching assistants employed at colleges, universities and professional schools in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Though some students prefer to learn from an experienced professor rather than a TA with little experience, one 2016 study found undergraduates are more likely to major in a discipline if a graduate student teaches their first course in the subject.
Among the 697 ranked colleges that submitted these data to U.S. News in an annual survey, Purdue University—West Lafayette in Indiana reported the highest percentage of graduate TAs who were listed as a primary instructor for undergraduate courses in fall 2015: 26 percent.
The 10 schools with the highest percentages were all public schools and National Universities, meaning they offer a full range of undergraduate programs as well as master's and doctoral degrees.
Among Regional Universities, which offer many undergraduate programs and some master's but few doctoral programs, Emporia State University in Kansas reported the highest percentage of TAs who taught classes in fall 2015, at 13 percent.
Overall, mainly National Universities and Regional Universities reported having TAs who teach classes – only two National Liberal Arts Colleges, which emphasize undergraduate education in the liberal arts and sciences, reported that TAs teach any courses, both at 2 percent. That's because many have low student-faculty ratios, so TAs aren't as necessary.
Of all the schools that reported these data to U.S. News, 544 listed zero percent.
Below are the 10 National Universities with the highest percentage of graduate TAs listed as primary instructors for undergraduate courses in fall 2015. Unranked schools, which did not meet certain criteria required by U.S. News to be numerically ranked, were not considered for this report.

Six Nigerian nationals have been extradited from South Africa for their alleged role in Internet scams involving dating websites and work-at-home schemes, the US Department of Justice said Monday.
A total of 20 defendants are charged in the case, for their alleged involvement in a variety of schemes such as fake online relationships with victims who were asked to ship and receive merchandise purchased with stolen credit cards and banking information.
The six extradited defendants face nine charges in the US state of Mississippi for the alleged activities which began as early as 2001.
"The defendants identified and solicited potential victims through online dating websites and work-at-home opportunities," the department said in a statement.
They were additionally involved in check scams as well as bank, financial and credit card account fraud.
They are charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to commit identity theft, use of unauthorized account access devices, theft of US government funds and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Three defendants have already been convicted for their roles while six await trial and two remain on the run. The United States is working to extradite three other Nigerians involved in the case.

Yesterday, the CBC released its review of Senior Business Correspondent Amanda Lang. It's awful.
As you may remember, Amanda Lang tried to sabotage their colleague's investigation of the largest bank in the country, RBC. Working behind-the-scenes within the CBC, they challenged their colleague Kathy Tomlinson's reporting on RBC as “unfair” to the bank. Then they tried making the story hers, inviting RBC CEO Gord Nixon on to their show for a softball interview in which they shook off responsibility and trashed Tomlinson's journalism. Then Lang went outside the corporation, penning an editorial for the Globe and Mail (without CBC's permission) in which they dismissed the scandal their colleague had uncovered as a “sideshow.”
And all of that might have been fine, had they disclosed to their CBC colleagues and to their audience that they had received thousands of dollars in speaking fees from RBC sponsored events and that their partner Geoff Beattie was an RBC board member.
In the wake of CANADALAND's reporting on these conflicts of interest, the UK Guardian columnist George Monbiot wrote: “It amazes me that [Lang] remains employed by CBC, which has so far done nothing but bluster and berate its critics.”
Lang eventually admitted they should have been more forthcoming about potential conflicts of interest. And CBC News pretty much conceded it had a conflict-of-interest problem when it banned paid speaking engagements for on-air talent.
Despite all of this, yesterday's review exonerates Lang.
Here are the reasons why it stinks:
1. It makes stuff up.
The review says that “Canadaland suggests that Lang tried to … ‘kill' the entire story.”
No, we didn't.
We never used the word “kill” in any of our reporting on Lang. We said they tried to “sabotage” the story. It would have been impossible for them to kill it, as by the time they heard about it is had already been reported.
Why is that an important error? Consider the fact that it's the same word Lang themselves used in their original self-defence, and the word CBC news boss Jennifer McGuire used in their defence of Lang. By exaggerating our coverage and using the same erroneous language, they sought to paint Lang as a victim of nasty trolls.
That a company PR talking point was copied and pasted into a supposedly objective internal review does not inspire much confidence.
The CBC review also says that “Amanda Lang was accused by Canadaland of being in a conflict of interest because of their relationship with a member of RBC's Board of Directors.”
Nope. Them CBC colleagues accused them of being in conflict, we just listened to them and told their story. The whole reason this story came out was because we were contacted by sources at the CBC who wanted Lang exposed.
And, when we spoke to her, the reporter who broke the RBC temporary foreign worker scandal thought Lang's behaviour was a problem, too. From our interview with Kathy Tomlinson:
I was very upset because of the perceived conflict of interest [Lang's various affiliations with RBC] created. Several people then questioned Lang's involvement in the story – and questioned why they did not reveal any potential conflicts to us up front.
We get it: it's easier to exonerate Lang from an attack by “the malevolent” (that's what they call us) than it is to explain why their own colleagues exposed and denounced them But that's what happened.
2. It dodges the point.
The review is designed to exonerate Lang by focusing on their on-air journalism, and not on their conflicts of interest. In an internal email yesterday, McGuire boasted that the review determined “the content of Amanda Lang's journalism has adhered to CBC's journalistic standards.”
But the scope of the CBC's review avoids any explicit ruling on whether Lang's actions violated conflict of interest rules. The report approaches a judgement several times and then backs off, saying that it's management's job to clarify the rules. But the rules are pretty clear: even the appearance of a conflict is a conflict, it's every CBC employee's duty to comply with conflict policy, to disclose and remove conflicts and to tell supervisors if they have a possible conflict. Lang obviously violated these.
If the CBC is willing to declare that, according to itself, its journalism is fine, why can't it take an explicit position on whether or not its conflict of interest rules were violated?
3. It pretends to include an “independent” review.
CBC hired the firm Cormex Research to analyze Lang's coverage of banks in general to see if their past coverage favoured RBC.
But what does this have to do with the issue at hand? Lang's coverage of the RBC TFWP scandal is the issue and yet the CBC widened the purview of the only independent party involved in the review so that it could only generally assess Lang's coverage of all the major banks over a two year period.
Cormex's findings offer no insight into or assessment of the quality of Lang's RBC TFWP coverage. That judgment is left entirely to a CBC employee, Director of Journalistic Public Accountability and Engagement Jack Nagler.
So no, you might not find obvious slant towards RBC in two years of coverage. But, if you watch Lang's interview with Gord Nixon, you will hear them trash the CBC's journalism as “unfair and misleading,” and you will hear their neglect to ask them “really? How so?”
Nagler, unsurprisingly, doesn't take issue and suggests that this is a matter of “style,” without giving thought to whether or not Lang's potential conflicts were a barrier to their ability to adjust their style if, for example, an interview subject attacked the CBC's journalism on the air.
By the way, since conflicts of interest are the core issue here, we should bring up the fact that Cormex counts RBC, Manulife and Sun Life among its clients. Probably something that should have been disclosed in the review.
4. It actually praises Lang.
The CBC's review:
“It should be understood that Amanda Lang is probably the only journalist we have who could have secured an interview with Gord Nixon that day. This was a significant ‘get', and it is due in no small part to the knowledge Lang possesses, the contacts they have, and the sense from Nixon's side that the interview would be fair.”
This is astonishing. Gord Nixon knew an interview with Lang would be “fair” because their board member was their partner. And that's among the reasons why they had such great access to him. The CBC basically suggests that conflicts of interest are neat because they give you a leg up on exclusives, nevermind the journalistic ethics.
5. The report's recommendations kind of admonish Kathy Tomlinson.
The CBC's review:
“Before going with an investigative story, there should be consultation with any relevant content unit. If it's about business, that means the Business Unit.”
Oh yeah, that's absolutely what Tomlinson should have done. Take note, CBC journos: before scandalizing a major Canadian institution, find out if anyone in the building is involved with a board member therein, and run your stuff by them first.
Look, collaboration between units is of course not a bad thing, but what if the unit you're collaborating with has a member who has conflicts of interest with your story? And what to do when they don't disclose that to you and instead challenge your story? Knowing that all of this was in play, it's absurd to suggest that Tomlinson should have let Lang vet them story.
6. It contradicts CBC's own journalism.
The CBC's review:
“Lang argued that our coverage was unfair to RBC, which may not have been doing anything wrong… Lang's critique of the stories is technically correct. Neither RBC nor iGate were shown to have broken the rules.”
This raises a really great meta-question: Does CBC News read CBC News?
Because, on CBC News' website, in its RBC TFWP coverage, CBC News says the rules were broken, right above and below the giant, bolded subhead “Displacement Against Rules.”
Jason Kenney, the guy in charge of immigration in Canada at the time, told CBC News, “The rules are very clear. You cannot displace Canadians to hire people from abroad.” RBC was set to lay off Canadians and had its contracter iGate (a company Lang was scheduled to speak for before this broke) bring in hirees from abroad. RBC apologized and the government amended the law to prevent further misuse.
So, let's add it up: the government thought RBC did something wrong and RBC apologized for doing something wrong. But Lang said they didn't, and now CBC management says she's “technically correct.”
7. It covers for Lang's dalliances with the Globe and Mail.
A few days after the RBC scandal broke, Amanda Lang took to the pages of the Globe and Mail to call the story “a sideshow.” This is a big no-no within the CBC: you need to get management's permission before writing for a rival news org. Lang didn't, and the review does in fact ding them for this.
But then they did it again.
When the CBC announced it was banning paid speaking engagements in January, Lang's quasi mea culpa appeared in the same newspaper as their earlier article. It came in the form of a turgid, lawyerly, 1600-word essay full of nightmarish verb constructs and abominable sentences.
So did they break the rule again to get their own message out? The review doesn't even bother asking this question, much less answering it.
Here's another question the review demurs from asking: why did Lang write Globe op-eds anyhow? They have their own show on the CBC, so why break the rules to opine elsewhere?
Neither CBC nor Lang have provided any coherent explanation as to why they went to the Globe in the first place.
When we first asked the CBC in January about Lang's original Globe piece, Head of Public Affairs Chuck Thompson told us they wrote it because the Globe and Mail asked them to. After we asked the Globe about it and they denied this, Thompson admitted that what they said was not true and that they were “mistakenly under the impression the Globe had approached Amanda Lang.” We asked Thompson just how they came to be mistaken: where did they get the misinformation from? They didn't reply.
When Postmedia's Ishmael Daro asked the CBC if Lang had gotten permission to write this second piece, they wouldn't answer.
Again, they wouldn't answer. They wouldn't answer. This is the biggest problem of all.
This has become the CBC's MO, in all its scandals and in all its controversies: internal reviews where it gets to make its own judgments about its own behaviour and cherrypick the questions it asks, a circling of the wagons by senior management, a deference to stars, and a refusal to explicitly answer the most pressing and difficult concerns posed to it by the media, by the government and by Canadians.
We did nothing wrong.
But we got caught doing it.
So we are changing the rules.
But we did nothing wrong.
Clearly, the Lang report does not approach the seriousness of another major internal review that's forthcoming, nor are the events it concerns comparable to what that review will report back on. But the Lang report matters because it's a test of how seriously the CBC treats the way it's viewed from the outside, and how honestly it's willing to look at itself.
In this case, the CBC eliminated the possibility of accountability for the events in question when it limited a third party to a broad analysis of two years worth of coverage and left any rulings about Lang's RBC TFWP coverage to its own employee. It should come as no surprise that this CBC employee exonerated the CBC.
The CBC witheld the right to final judgment of itself to itself, and that is the ultimate conflict of interest.
Editor's Note: During editing, the outdated phrase “off the reservation” was added to the originally published version of this article to emphasize a point. Whether intentional or not, using this phrase is harmful and offensive. NPR has a good guide for why it is and why it should fall out of use by everyone, including us, here.
Harris County constables have confirmed they have received reports that a serial pooper, who was caught defecating in people's back yards, is up to their old tricks again.
Constables at Precinct 1 say they received a call from someone earlier today saying they have a photo of the man and that they saw them walking around with toilet paper.
"There's a very good chance it is the same guy," said J.C. Mosier, Precinct 1 spokesperson, "It is on the same street where this was happening before."
Mosier said they are waiting for the photo to be sent to them before they can follow up the report.
Back in May, a 56-year-old man was brought in for questioning over the alleged pooping incidents and confessed to the crimes, according to county officials.
Houston police caught the man urinating in a public area in the 2400 block of Fulton.
Charges were not brought on the grounds the man had serious mental health issues.
Following this and other blogs picking-up on the SL11B photo contest the Lab announced yesterday and the fact that it may be off-putting to some SL users (see: Lab launches SL11B L$10,000 photo contest), Pete Linden (Peter Gray, the Lab's Director of Global Communications) posted the following comment on why Facebook has been used (which they also posted to Ciaran Laval's blog):
We realize that a number of Second Life users have reservations about using Facebook and other platforms. In this case, we chose to run the contest through our Facebook page simply because we have a tool on our page that facilitates running a contest with all of the legal stuff (technical term) we need in place to run something like this, and we thought it would be of interest to the more than 366,000 followers of the official Second Life page. Our aim certainly isn't to discourage participation, and we'll certainly explore alternative ways to run similar contests in the future.
The issue of “the legal stuff” is actually something I mentioned in my original post when ruminating on using alternatives such as Flickr, pointing out that “ensuring T&Cs are read might be a little harder.”
Given that the Facebook approach requires that people at least click-through the T&Cs prior to entering a contest does make the Lab's position somewhat understandable. It doesn't matter if people read them, the fact that they've clicked through them absolves the Lab of a degree of potential nastiness after the fact if someone decided to get severely upset (probably unlikely, but the kind of thing lawyers are paid to worry about and mitigate). Truth be told, a link on a Flickr group doesn't provide the same level of in-your-face immediacy.
I did also flippantly mention the visibility aspect as well – particularly if a fair proportion of those 366,000 followers on Facebook aren't active SL users. I've actually no problem with this; if the contest increases SL's visibility among non-SL users, then so much the better. Particularly as we're all pretty much agreed that SL needs more positive advertising, and a fun-looking competition among users does look and feel positive.
Nevertheless, it would be nice to see competitions like this, which are not constrained by external considerations (as was the case with last year's Dell Alienware competitions), to be put forward in a way that encourages SL user participation, rather than potentially discouraging it. In this, it is pleasing to hear that the Lab is taking the feedback onboard and will seek alternatives for the future.
My thanks to Pete for providing the feedback.

6 Huawei Executives Arrested for Corporate Espionage
Chinese media outlets have hinted that corporate espionage between Huawei and LeEco have escalated to unprecedented heights. Huawei has reportedly pressed charges against six product designers from its consumer business division. Huawei claims that the executives leaked sensitive information as well as corporate trade secrets to LeEco.

As of this writing, the six Huawei product designers have been arrested and charged.
Following the arrests, LeEco released a statement claiming that the company has no knowledge or connection with the six arrested Huawei officials. LeEco added that it did not receive any information from the six arrested officials. However, the company admitted that it has some patent disputes with Huawei, according to Giz China.
This is just the latest episode in the ongoing patent war between LeEco and Huawei. In the past, Huawei has accused LeEco of infringing on its patents, according to Phone Arena. Huawei later added that the six arrested executives are part of a bigger scheme to steal the company's secrets and share (or possibly sell) them to LeEco.
LeEco has made headlines over the past few weeks. The company has made a huge leap in the United States market selling some of its smartphone and 4K TV devices on Amazon. LeEco, which is known for its wide range of affordable yet decently made smartphones, is looking to expand its market by selling products like electric cars and smart bicycles.

For years, the United States government stuck to its nonsensical claim that the Syrian government was the only party in Syria using chemical weapons despite their being no evidence that the SAA has ever used such weapons. Finally, the State Department was forced to admit that ISIS had indeed used chemical weapons but it still stuck to the claim that, out of the anti-Syrian “rebel” forces, only ISIS was dastardly enough to use them.
Now, however, a revised travel warning from the State Department's own website has expanded the admission of Western-backed terrorists' use of chemical weapons just a little further to include Jobhat al-Nusra, Jobhat Fatah al-Sham, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
The State Department warning reads:
Tactics of ISIS, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, and other violent extremist groups include the use of suicide bombers, kidnapping, small and heavy arms, improvised explosive devices, and chemical weapons. They have targeted major city centers, road checkpoints, border crossings, government buildings, shopping areas, and open spaces, in Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, and Dayr al-Zawr provinces. These groups have murdered and kidnapped U.S. citizens, both for ransom and political purposes; in some instances U.S. citizens have disappeared within Syria. Because of the security situation in Syria, the U.S. government's ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is very limited.
Russia's Defense Ministry has been quick to point out that the United States is now admitting these groups have used chemical weapons in Syria, with spokesperson General Igor Konashenkov stating that “This is the first official recognition by the State Department not only of the presence, but the very use of chemical weapons by Al-Nusra terrorists to carry out terrorist attacks, which we repeatedly warned about.”
Previously, the United States had admitted that ISIS has used chemical weapons.
“[Islamic State] has used them in Iraq and Syria in the past, and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons,” Colonel John Dorrian, spokesperson for the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, said in an emailed statement to the New York Times.
US system ‘designed for political combat,' former VP says
Arguing that the Jan. 8 shooting in Tucson was the act of a “lone, crazed gunman,” former Vice President is deflecting blame from the “political class” for the massacre that took the lives of six people and seriously injured Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
In an interview with NBC's Jamie Gangel, set to air on the Today Show Tuesday, Cheney made it clear the blame should be laid with the alleged gunman, and not with politicians or media pundits.
“I think our politics can get pretty rough at times. Having been vice president for eight years, maybe I'm more sensitive to it than others,” Cheney said. “I think we have to be cautious I guess about jumping to conclusions here about the extent to which the sort of the political environment contributed to or caused this event. I think the event was caused by a deranged individual. And that's where we ought to look in terms of trying to assess guilt.”
Jared Lee Loughner, 22, was arrested at the scene of the shooting, sparking a fierce debate over whether the inflammatory rhetoric seen in US politics in recent years may have contributed to their decision to open fire on a politician they allegedly disliked. Some observers have argued Loughner is suffering from severe mental illness. Others have even blamed marijuana.
“I'm reluctant to judge our politicians based upon the act of what appears to be a lone, crazed gunman who perpetrated the crime,” Cheney said.
Though Cheney appeared receptive to “toning down” political rhetoric as “always good advice,” they warned against changing US politics as a result of the incident.
“I don't think we should anticipate that we can somehow take a system that was designed for political combat, if you will, between the parties, between ideas, between principles, and set that aside,” they said. “I wouldn't want to do that. That's the heart and soul of our political system. And that's basically a good thing.”
Cheney also reiterated their assertion that President Obama will be a one-term president, dismissing the president's recent bounce in the polls.
“I think their overall approach to expanding the size of government, expanding the deficit, and giving more and more authority and power to the government over the private sector is a lack of — sort of feel for the role of the private sector in creating jobs, in creating wealth and getting our economy back on track,” Cheney said. “Those are all weaknesses, as I look at Barack Obama. And I think he'll be a one-term President.”
I Can't Binge-Watch Jessica Jones (And That's A Good Thing)
Elyse Wietstock Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 22, 2015
I watched the first episode of the latest Netflix original Jessica Jones and was equal parts impressed and stressed out. I realized this was one Netflix offering I was not going to be able to watch all at once, because its depiction of PTSD and abuse is at times visceral and disturbing. Thanks to warnings I read online before viewing the show, I was aware that the series might be hard to watch, but I still found myself getting anxious as the story unfolded. But unlike other shows that seem to delight in depicting women in distress, I'm not turned off watching it just because the content sometimes makes me uncomfortable. In fact, I'm determined to finish the season as soon as possible because I sincerely want to see Jessica take Kilgrave down. I trust Jessica Jones to do right by survivors of assault and abuse, and that's incredibly important for a female-led superhero show.
Krysten Ritter as Jessica is wonderful; a no-nonsense private investigator with superpowers and lingering nightmares, they are simultaneously untouchable and deeply vulnerable.  They are determined to work through their trauma on their own terms, having been to therapy for their experience with Kilgrave and finding it ultimately unhelpful (though they continue to use a calming technique offered to them by their therapist, naming streets from their hometown when they suffer a traumatic flashback or anxiety attack.) Like a true antihero, Jessica's chilly exterior masks a brave and caring soul who is sympathetic to Kilgrave's other victims and dedicated to their apprehension. In fact, their characterization reminds me of another beloved female character who deals with the victims of abuse and trauma, Olivia Benson of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Though Jones drinks a little more heavily than Benson, they are both survivors who are committed to protecting others and helping victims heal.
It is important that Jessica Jones treats the subject matter of rape, assault, abuse, and PTSD as seriously as it does because these are issues that are often invisible in our society. Survivors of abuse are often silenced and blamed when they should be believed and supported, and their stories deserve much more nuance and humanity than they are currently given. While it would be overly optimistic to insinuate that the tides of opinion could be immediately changed by a Marvel show on Netflix, the story of a woman with super-strength who survived their life being controlled by someone else and by escaping inspired hope in others is nonetheless an excellent start to a desperately-needed cultural conversation on victim-blaming and sexual assault. Jessica Jones gives me hope because it is clear that the show's subject matter is not being used for a quick shock or to give the Marvel universe more “gritty” or “dark” appeal, it is being done with care and privileging the perspective and development of the survivor.
I'm going to continue watching Jessica Jones, a little at a time. I want to really appreciate the work that is being put in by the actors, writers, and showrunners to tell the story of survivors everywhere with honesty and compassion. It is a story that has been long overdue, and which must keep being told until the lesson is learned. One popular superhero show won't solve everything, but it can't hurt either.
A new update to the Steam beta client today added support for Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers, as well as any generic X-Input controller. What this means is you can now use practically any gamepad you want through Steam as if it were a Steam controller—without being forced to actually use a Steam controller.
This is a continued expansion of Steam's controller support after they added official support for the PS4 controller last month. It makes sense that Xbox controllers would be hot on its heels, and the inclusion of X-Input support means that Valve now has most gamepads out there covered. It also means that you likely won't ever need to fiddle around in JoyToKey or a similar keyboard-to-X-input mapping program ever again, as you can just map it all through Steam or download someone else's profile who has already done so.
Another nice perk of this support is that you can save profiles to specific controllers that Steam will remember each time you plug them in, as well as use the Steam controllers rather robust set of tools for mapping complex button presses or mouse movements. While I'm not crazy about the Steam controller itself, opening up its customizable toolset to more comfortable gamepad alternatives is actually pretty exciting.
You can opt into the Steam beta client by going into the "Account" tab of your Steam settings, selecting "Change…" under the "Beta participation" section, and choosing "Steam Beta Update" from the dropdown menu. To make non-Steam controllers customizable, you'll need to enter Big Picture Mode, click the "Controller Settings" tab in the settings menu, then check the boxes to enable configuration support for whatever controller you are using. You can then choose a game, click "Manage Game," and then "Controller Configuration" to customize it to your heart's content.
No word on when this update will move from beta to live, but it took the PS4 controller support a little over a month.

Read our full Intel Core i7-5960X review.
At Computex 2014, companies like MSI, EVGA, and ASRock showcased motherboards based on Intel's x99 chipset, which supports a host of new features including faster Haswell-E (Enthusiast) processors, faster DDR4 memory, and faster SATA Express storage technology. These, and a wealth of extended connectivity and expansion options, make the next-generation, soon-to-be-released x99-based PCs the fastest we've seen so far.
8-core CPUs
While many things about these new motherboards are noteworthy, perhaps the most important factor is their support for 8-core CPUs. With Haswell-E, Intel will retire 4-core configurations, and offer buyers a choice of 6- and 8-core processors with up to 20MB of L3 cache, as well as hyper threading via up to 16 logical cores, for up to 16 threads. Intel is claiming increased performance by as much as 33 to 50 percent.
DDR4
As mentioned, in addition to faster processors, the x99-based motherboards will also support the latest memory standard, DDR4, which, after all is said and done, will increase bandwidth by about 50 percent. These memory chips will also use less power. The inclusion of DDR4 will make the new X99 motherboards the first in Intel's “Wellsburg” family of motherboard chipsets. In addition to DDR4, Wellsburg will support the following options:
Note, though, that what we don't see in this list is support for the brand new USB 3.1 standard. For some reason, that will require a different motherboard, such as MSI's Z97-G55 SLI, which was also showcased at Computex 2014. However, this MSI motherboard doesn't provide some of the other x99 features—most notably, DDR4 support. Since USB 3.1 achieves its 10MB transfer speeds by combining PCIe lanes, though, it shouldn't be that difficult to implement in x99 chipsets.
SATA Express
Samsung, Asus, and a few other manufacturers are developing SATA Express-based solid state drives (SSDs) with nearly twice the bandwidth—10Gbps versus the current SATA 3.0 standard's 6Gbps, making them 67 percent faster. In addition to being much faster, some of these new SSDs, such as Samsung Semiconductor's SV843, have much greater capacity than today's standard SSDs. The SV843, for example, holds up to 960GB. Right now, Samsung is classifying these SSDs as data center-class drives. As you might expect, they won't be cheap, but that may not last long.
When will we see x99-based motherboards?
According to Intel, the Wellsburg family, Haswell-E motherboards are slated for release “in the September 2014 time frame.” In other words, very soon. We should actually see motherboards and PCs based on this new chipset about that same time. Most computer makers have committed to incorporating the standard, and each manufacturer has begun developing products based on it.
MSI, for instance, will release a Haswell-E motherboard featuring the high-performance Core i7-5960X CPU with eight cores and 16 threads. It will come at a rather steep $999 US price tag, though, which will make for some rather expensive PCs. But then, this may seem like a small price to pay for enthusiasts who require faster and more powerful computers.
Faster CPUs, faster memory, faster and higher-capacity storage devices—all of this adds up to significantly faster PCs, but no matter how you look at it, the most possible performance increase could be well under 50 percent. Still, gamers and multimedia professionals will take all they can get.
MA'ALEH ADUMIM, WEST BANK – Scarlett Johansson's decision to part ways with international anti-poverty outfit Oxfam so they can keep their endorsement deal with Israeli fizz-maker SodaStream has intensified the global controversy over businesses that operate in the occupied Palestinian territories. But the Palestinian employees here basically have no idea who they are.
"Maybe if they saw her, they would know who they are,'' shrugged Wassim Siam, a 26-year-old quality-control employee approached by a reporter outside the plant just as they were arriving for their Friday shift.
They might be more clued in if someone bothered to come here and screen the commercial that was produced for millions to see on Super Bowl Sunday about the at-home carbonated drink machines that they and 1,300 others—500 Palestinian Arabs from the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, 450 Arab Israelis, and 350 Jewish Israelis—assemble and package in the West Bank.
Siam says SodaStream's management has yet to brief employees about the Hollywood starlet, who signed on as the company's brand ambassador earlier this month, or tell them about the sultry commercial that Fox nixed from the Super Bowl over digs at Pepsi and Coke (an edited version was approved for broadcast). Not to mention their decision to end their seven-year tenure as an Oxfam ambassador after Oxfam objected to SodaStream's ownership of a plant in Palestinian territory that it, and the United Nations, regard as illegally occupied by the Israeli military.
"Nobody here knows they made a commercial for SodaStream," they said. "Nobody knows who they are, what, why, or when.''
Sporting black Ray-Bans and a matching black jacket, Siam was standing just outside of the plant's iron gate after getting off a bus that had ferried them from a checkpoint in East Jerusalem to the Mishor Adumim industrial zone, located in the bald hills of the Judean Desert that lead down to the Dead Sea.
U.S., Israeli, German, Australian, and Swedish (but not Palestinian) flags flap silently at the SodaStream gate. From the street outside the factory (management declined to open up to a reporter), the last row of mid-rise apartment buildings are visible just up the hill in the Israeli settlement of Maaleh Adumim. Popping up over the west horizon is the water tower of Hebrew University atop Mount Scopus in Jerusalem—the edge of Israel proper—a 15-minute drive away.
The flags of Israel, Germany, Australia, the United States, and Sweden—but not the Palestinian Authority—fly outside SodaStream's West Bank plant.
Just before 7 a.m., the silence outside the plant is disturbed by the roar of engines as the SodaStream fleet of buses and vans begin to queue up, and the Palestinian employees from nearby West Bank villages make their way to work.
In a Huffington Post blog post last week defending their association with SodaStream, Johansson said she's "proud of the...quality of their product and work environment," and said the factory places Israelis and Palestinians together side-by-side in cooperation. That frankly sounds too kumbaya to be true, but a similar sentiment was actually volunteered without prompting by the Palestinian workers here.
"Hell yeah, I'm happy. We're like family. We have fun,'' said Mohammed Yousef, 22, from the Palestinian village of Jaba. "We are Jews and Muslims here. We are here peacefully. We have no problems. Everyone is complaining about settlements here and everywhere, but SodaStream is different.''
The workers here say they take home about $1,200 monthly–anywhere from double to triple common wages in the territories. The company also provides pensions and some medical insurance.
Yousef said that many here are also for the most part unfamiliar with Oxfam, the anti-poverty human rights non-profit that has operated in the West Bank for years on behalf of the Palestinians.
Palestinians are, of course, familiar with their own government, which is encouraging international efforts to boycott the settlements that they — and most of the international community — say have been illegally constructed on their land and are slowly eating away at a future state on the West Bank.
"Mrs. Johnson [sic] decided to continue endorsing SodaStream, which operates illegally in the occupied State of Palestine,'' wrote Ahsraf Khatib, an official with the Negotiations Affairs Department, a Palestine Liberation Organization outfit that advises the Palestinian Authority in peace talks, in an email. "We believe that they should have dropped their endorsement in exchange of supporting human rights and freedom of people under occupation.''
Several years ago, the Palestinian Authority embarked on a major PR campaign to get Palestinians to boycott Israeli products from the settlements in their stores, drawing up long lists of goods to be banned from the shelves. The campaign largely failed.
Truth be told, the SodaStream workers and local Palestinians were downright peeved when asked about the efforts of solidarity activists and their own government to boycott SodaStream. That could cost the hundreds of Palestinians wage earners salaries that are significantly higher than what they would make at home.
"Prostitutes are better than politics. Politics doesn't bring me bread,'' said one 34-year-old packaging worker who declined to give their name. "Leave me alone with the Palestinian state. If they close the plant, where will I go?''
Just a two-minute drive away from the industrial zone is a small strip of Israeli retailers featuring a discount Rami Levy supermarket chain (which also employees Palestinians from the West Bank) that is a big draw for Israeli locals.
A random sampling of shoppers in the parking lot revealed that, like their Palestinian neighbors, most Israelis were vaguely familiar, at best, with Johansson. Still, their stand against Oxfam and against the boycott movement has won their decent media coverage here, and several had caught wind of the controversy on the TV news.
Even though the movie star insisted their endorsement of SodaStream is not political, some see it as an expression of solidarity with Israel.
"We're very proud of them She's Jewish. She's standing firm. Good for her.'' said Einat Sabag, a 40-year-old lawyer at Israel's Courts Authority, as they loaded their trunk up with groceries. "Ma'aleh Adumim isn't a settlement on a hill. Its a city that's just a few minutes from Jerusalem.''
If anything is causing unease at the SodaStream factory, it's anxiety that the firm might shut down the West Bank plant and move all of its operations inside of Israel, where a new factory is set to open in May. Several weeks ago, about 100 got layoff notices.
Siam, who eventually checked out the Johansson commercial on YouTube, told me they liked it, especially the dig at Coke and Pepsi. "That was so cool.'' That said, Siam said they understood the objections of the pro-Palesitnian activists who denounced their company's ambassador.
"I talk a lot to friends abroad. They say, 'You are an Arab. How can you work there?'" they said. "Nobody knows there are 1,000 people and their lives will be turned upside down by the [boycott]. You are killing them, so stop it.''

Auckland commuters parking on city fringe streets are set to pay almost three times as much from July 25 due to changes implemented by Auckland Transport.
Auckland commuters parking on city fringe streets are set to pay almost three times as much, under new charges proposed by Auckland Transport.
The agency plans to raise the cost of parking on streets from Wynyard Quarter through to Grafton Gully from $2 or $3 an hour, to a standard $3 per hour for the first two hours then $6 an hour thereafter.
It means parking for an eight-hour day will go up from $16 in some places around the fringe to $43.
LAWRENCE SMITH/FAIRFAX Parking charges on some Auckland streets will go up from $16 to as much as $63 a day.
Charges for parking on streets in the CBD will also rise, from the current $4 an hour for the first two hours and $8 thereafter to $4.50 and $9 respectively.

* Auckland's top-10 ticketed parking offences
* Price hike for all-day parking in Auckland
It means it will cost a whopping $63 to park all day on a CBD street, up from $56 at the moment.
It costs $24 a day to park in the council-run Downtown, Civic and Victoria St parking buildings, and $16 in the Fanshawe St car park.
The transport agency says the changes are part of the "demand responsive pricing" policy it now operates, which means that if there is high demand in an area it will put the prices up.
It sets prices at a level that ensures people can find a car park most of the time within a short walk of their destination.
The areas most affected by the new charges will be the Wynyard Quarter on the city's western fringe, some streets around Sale Street near Victoria Park, and the streets around Vector Arena.
At peak times, parking in these areas is at an average 84 per cent of capacity, Auckland Transport (AT) said.
In the CBD an average 94 per cent of parks is taken at peak times, it said.
There had been a considerable increase in demand for parking over the past three years, with average peak occupancy in central Auckland rising from 73 per cent in 2013 to 88 per cent by last year.
There had also been a 10 per cent reduction in the number of spaces available due to street upgrades and new bus and cycle lanes, AT said.
The changes take effect from June, and will also standardise parking charges in the city centre from three pricing areas down to just two.
Auckland's city centre is entering a building boom, with major projects such as the City Rail Link and the redevelopment of the Downtown shopping centre getting underway and making driving around the CBD difficult.
AT is running an extended campaign to encourage people travelling into the centre to leave their cars at home.

(CNN) Senegalese troops have entered neighboring Gambia amid a growing crisis as the West African nation's longtime ruler Yahya Jammeh refuses to step down.
Jammeh, who took power in a 1994 military coup, suffered a surprise election defeat in December to Adama Barrow, who won 45% of the vote. Jammeh originally conceded the presidency, but then announced their "total rejection of the election results."
Barrow was sworn on Thursday at Gambia's embassy in Senegal, as the United Nations Security Council backed an effort by West African states to remove Jammeh.
The UN called on "all stakeholders, within and outside the Gambia, to exercise restraint, respect the rule of law and ensure the peaceful transfer of power."
Troops from several West African countries had been poised to intervene if Jammeh insisted on staying in the post beyond a midnight deadline.
Senegal, Ghana, Togo and Mali are among the countries which contributed to the military effort, while the Nigerian Air Force said 200 of its troops would join forces from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
"The deployment is also to forestall hostilities or breakdown of law and order that may result from the current political impasse in the Gambia," a Nigerian statement said.
Leader-in-waiting
Barrow has been waiting in Senegal -- which surrounds Gambia -- for the handover of power. In their first speech as leader, they hailed the "victory of the Gambian nation."
This is a victory of the Gambian nation. Our national flag will fly high among those of the most democratic nations of the world. #Gambia pic.twitter.com/QRGZg1gzbs — Adama Barrow (@adama_barrow) January 19, 2017
"Our national flag will now fly high," they said. "Violence is finished forever from the life of the Gambians. There is no loser in this election. We promise to unify our people. Today most Gambians are united in order to give Gambia a new start. Today I am the President of all Gambians."
They pledged to "respect the rule of law and fundamental freedoms" and promised "significant democratic reform."

And they called on the country's military to remain loyal: "I command all members of the armed forces to remain in their barracks. Those found wanting, or in possession of firearms, without my order, shall be considered rebels."
Barrow's spokesperson, Halifa Sallah, said the military "will have to decide which side they are on."
Facing uncertainty at home, people in Banjul, Gambia, head to a ferry this week bound for Senegal.
Seeking safety
Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes in the Gambia fearing political violence, as Save the Children warned of the danger of a humanitarian emergency.
"These children are largely fleeing to parts of both Gambia and Senegal where public services such as health facilities and schools are already under a great deal of strain," said Bonzi Mathuri, Save the Children's Senegal country director.
Senegalese soldiers are entering the country to remove Jammeh.
On Tuesday, Jammeh declared a state of emergency, claiming "a situation exists which, if it is allowed to continue, may lead to a state of public emergency," and said they had filed an application with Gambia's Supreme Court to prevent Barrow being sworn in
Hundreds of tourists have been pouring out of the Gambia as the risk of violence grows and the US and UK issued warnings to citizens to consider leaving the country.
In a statement on its website, tour operator Thomas Cook said it was "working hard to get our UK customers home" and it expected to fly about 3,500 vacationers out of the Gambia by the end of Friday.
British tourist Sara Wilkins, 44, told CNN they and their husband arrived in the Gambia nearly a week ago and noticed a lot of military on the streets. They said they had not been able to leave their hotel in recent days.
Tourists gather at the Banjul airport Wednesday as tour operators send in extra flights for evacuation.
Wilkins said they had witnessed "manic" scenes at the airport and at the hotel, where "everyone was panicking and crying."
On their return flight home, they said they sat next to a Gambian man who cried throughout the journey having failed to get their wife and 3-month-old baby out of the country.
The UK warned that "potential for military intervention and civil disturbance is high and could result in Banjul International Airport being closed on short notice."
'Fitter than ever' Wilshere ready to play big role for Arsenal
The 25-year-old is delighted with the improvements they have shown in training with the Gunners and is ready to get back into the starting XI
Jack Wilshere says they are ready for regular playing time at as their fitness levels are "the best they've ever been".
The international has suffered persistent iniuries in their career and recently recovered from a calf problem they picked up on loan at Bournemouth in April.
Wilshere has featured three times for Arsenal's first-team this season - starting and finishing against Doncaster Rovers in the EFL Cup and BATE Borisov in the - but they are yet to make an appearance in the since their return from the Cherries.
Arsenal -1 11/8 v Watford
The 25-year-old says they are fitter than ever and proving to Arsene Wenger in training that they are back at the same level as their team-mates.
“I always hear the boss say it's my first five-metre burst, when I receive the ball and get away from defenders, and I feel that's getting better and better each day,” they told Arsenal's website.
“I feel like the way to improve that is in games when you're playing against opposition that want to win and want to win the ball back and you have to be able to keep the ball.
“That's coming back and my fitness levels, if I'm honest, are probably the best they've ever been. I look at my numbers after the game and I've been out for four months and I'm not the one who hasn't run the most.
"Now don't get me wrong, I don't run the most, we've got a lot of players that do that, but my numbers are good so I'm happy.”
Wilshere admits they have had to adapt their training routine due to the injuries they have struggled with over the years, but says they are more determined to return to regular playing time.

“When I first broke into the first team, even looking back when I was 16, you take things for granted. I was training every day and when you're a 16-year-old, you can do that," they said.
“As you get older your body changes, you pick up injuries, you have to be more careful with certain situations and it makes you stronger as well. I've always loved playing football and that's what I wanted to do.
“Of course there's been times when it's been tough, when you're injured and you wake up in the morning, you think ‘Oh I've got to go to training, all the other lads are training, you've got to go to the gym'. That makes you stronger and it makes you appreciate it more and try and do everything you can to keep fit and keep on the pitch.”
A number of vague creepy clown threats have popped up on social media lately across Connecticut. They were followed by several arrests.
The trend in Connecticut and elsewhere in the country has some on edge, but many threats have already been ruled not credible by local police departments and officials.
Clown impact carried into Thursday. State Police warned would-be clown pranksters that there could be criminal consequences to their actions.
Three teens were arrested by Ansonia Police in connection with social media threats. Arrests were also made in Naugatuck and Beacon Falls.
Lyman Hall High School in Wallingford will have an increased police presence throughout the day after a specific threat to the school.
"It's the scary version of the ridiculous headlines you all saw a few months ago saying some A-list celebrity was moving to your town," Middletown Mayor Dan Drew said about rumors of creepy clowns in their town. "I kept seeing headlines saying Bill Murray was moving to Middletown and that Brad Pitt was moving to Meriden, but it isn't true."
Rumors prompted hundreds of UConn students to leave their dormitories in search of the creepy clowns. Some were armed with golf clubs and hockey sticks.
A rumor spread that Quinnipiac University in Hamden was on lockdown Monday night, but the school tweeted that everything was running normally. Public safety received several reports about a clown but found nothing upon investigation, according to the Hartford Courant.
New Haven Public School and police officials investigated clown-related Instagram posts.
"At this time there is no indication this incident poses any real or substantial threat to New Haven Public Schools or students," said New Haven Public Schools spokesperson Mercy Quaye.
The director of security for the school system has asked principals to prohibit clown costumes "and any symbols of terror" during the Halloween season.
Cases remain open and New Haven Police have about a dozen police personnel investigating, said Officer David Hartman, police spokesperson.
"We are not seeing a tangible threat, but that does not mean we aren't keeping eyes and ears open," they said.
Any police action will be on a case by case basis.
"One thing we aren't taking this as is a joke, this impacts people and budgets," they said.
The state has laws regarding school threats, but so far New Haven cases haven't reached that level, Hartman said.
Recently some middle school students were horsing around with a clown mask, which was confiscated, said New Haven Superintendent Garth Harries.

It isn't the first time that creepy clown reports have become a trend before Halloween. Reports date back to at least 1981, according to Slate. In many instances the clowns aren't found.
The first creepy clown report this year was in South Carolina in mid-August when a group of children told a sinister tale of clowns living in an abandoned house in the woods and trying to entice them with money to follow them into the woods, The New York Times reported. Police weren't sure at the time if the sightings were real or the product of children's imaginations.
So far, about a dozen people have been arrested in multiple states, and there have been creepy clown reports in at least 28 states, according to media reports. Creepy clown reports have resulted in school lockdowns in Reading, Ohio and Alabama.
Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton tweeted Tuesday morning that no clowns were sighted in the city after several people tweeted to their popular Twitter account about clowns in town.

Calls were made to Sacred Heart University security and Fairfield Police early Oct. 3 concerning social media-reported sightings of a clown in a vehicle sitting outside a Bridgeport residence that was occupied by SHU students. A resident took a photograph, and Bridgeport Police arrived and found no clown or vehicle.
SHU notified students and staff that the university will investigate any reported instance involving students, both on and off campus. The university noted that students found to be dressing as clowns in order to be disruptive or cause fear could face discipline. Any clowns who aren't members of the school community could face trespassing charges if found on campus.
Local police can charge menacing clowns with breach of peace or disorderly conduct if they determine the conduct rose to a criminal level.
Naugatuck Police investigated several social media posts that vaguely mention clowns and local schools.
"We do not believe to be credible, however the Naugatuck police are thoroughly investigating these posts and any persons connected to them," police said in a statement.
Security and a police presence was added at schools Tuesday.
In a Tuesday morning update, Naugatuck Police Lt. Bryan Cammarata said "just an update to all you parents out there - ALL IS WELL!!"
"The schools are all in session and the day has been very uneventful ... except for learning ... there is much learning taking place ... and clown free learning at that ...," Cammarata said.
Hartford Deputy Chief Brian Foley urged people to drop the clown hoax.
Please, Enough with the "Scary Clown" hoax. Trying to scare? At this point, we have to be concerned with the clowns' safety. #Notagoodidea

Downing Street's official denial that it played no behind-the-scenes role in the nine-hour detention of a Brazilian man at Heathrow airport was cast into doubt last night after a Washington official claimed the US was given a “heads-up” by the British government that “something was likely to occur”.
No 10 has so far refused to answer operational questions over the treatment of David Miranda, the partner of the Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, insisting that the decision to use UK anti-terror laws to question the Brazilian citizen had been taken by Scotland Yard.
Mr Miranda, 28, said that British customs officials had detained them for nearly nine hours – the maximum time permitted under schedule seven of the Terrorism Act 2000 – and forced them to reveal the passwords to their computer and mobile phone.
We'll tell you what's true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.
“They were threatening me all the time and saying I would be put in jail if I didn't co-operate,” they told The Guardian. “They treated me like I was a criminal or someone about to attack the UK … It was exhausting and frustrating, but I knew I wasn't doing anything wrong.”
Mr Miranda has been assisting their partner in making revelations linked to documents leaked by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden. During their trip to Berlin, Miranda visited Laura Poitras, the US film-maker who has been working with Mr Greenwald on the Snowden revelations. It was reported last night that Britain alerted the US authorities after Mr Miranda's name appeared on a passenger manifest of the flight.
Published material from Mr Snowden concerning the operations of the US National Security Agency and its co-operation with Britain's intelligence communications agency, GCHQ, has caused deep embarrassment to both governments.
Last night Scotland Yard defended the detention of Mr Miranda as “legally and procedurally sound”. A statement said: “The examination of a 28-year-old man under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 at Heathrow Airport on Sunday 18 August was subject to a detailed decision-making process. The procedure was reviewed throughout to ensure the examination was both necessary and proportionate. Our assessment is that the use of the power in this case was legally and procedurally sound.”
The statement came after Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, and the shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, both demanded that Scotland Yard explain why the UK's anti-terror powers had been used to justify the airport detention. Greenwald's partner was on their way to Brazil, after a meeting in Berlin with a US film-maker who has also been working with The Guardian on the Snowden revelations. The newspaper had paid for Mr Miranda's flights.
The Met has refused to explain why Mr Miranda was stopped, why it held them for the maximum nine hours allowed in law, and why personal possessions such as their computer, phone and digital storage devices were taken from him.
The Home Office has also been silent, claiming it was down to the police officers at the airport to make the operational decisions that led to the detention and questioning by six officials. Although the Home Office claimed the operation was “Met-led”, security sources told The Independent that officers from MI6 may have been among those involved in the lengthy questioning of Mr Miranda.
The matter was further complicated last night after a Washington official denied the US was involved in the decision to detain Mr Miranda but said it was given a warning by the British government that the obstruction was likely to occur. During a press conference at the White House, Josh Earnest, the deputy spokesperson, said: “This was action taken by the British government and this was something that they did independent of our direction.
They added: “There was a ‘heads-up' that was provided by the British government, so this was something we had an indication was likely to occur. But it is not something that we requested.”
David Davis, the former shadow Home Secretary, said ministers were using the excuse of national security to avoid questions on Mr Miranda's detention. They urged Downing Street to reveal what it knew, claiming that the operational background must have gone beyond the control of the police.
The Met confirmed that it held a 28-year-old man at Heathrow between 8am and 5pm on Sunday under Schedule 7 and that the man had not been arrested. The Guardian said it was seeking clarification on the reasons for the detention. Liberty's director, Shami Chakrabarti, said their organisation had already launched a challenge in the European Court of Human Rights over the use of Schedule 7.
Mr Greenwald accused the British authorities of bullying and intentional intimidation, linked to the Snowden revelations on the NSA. Mr Vaz has asked the Met to justify its use of anti-terrorism powers. They told the BBC: “I would not have expected it [the law] to be used in a case of this kind.” Ms Cooper called for an investigation to be made into whether or not terror powers had been misused against Mr Miranda.
Q&A: Your rights over Terrorism Act 2000
Q. Can the section of the Terrorism Act 2000 used to detain David Miranda be applied anywhere in the UK?
A. No. Schedule 7 of the 2000 law is supposed to give the police the authority to stop and question passengers at ports, airports and international rail terminals.
Q. Can you refuse to answer questions in this situation?
A. You can try, but if you fail to co-operate and are deemed to have obstructed questioning, then the law says you have committed a criminal offence which can carry a three-month jail sentence, a fine, or both.
Q. What would one need to have done to be detained and questioned under this law?
A. The police don't need to tell you what they think you might have done. No grounds for their suspicion need be offered before questioning.
Q. How much information do you need to supply?
A. A lot. Questioning can legally last up to nine hours – and anything a police officer asks has to be answered.
Q. Presumably they'll need a warrant to search my computer and tech stuff?
A. No, they don't. All such property can be seized. Data from laptops and phones can be downloaded and retained.

The fact that subtitled episodes of Downton Abbey are watched by 160 million viewers shows just what a love affair the Chinese have developed with foreign television shows and formats remade for their market. With Big Brother and Educating Yorkshire the latest shows to be lined up for a Chinese makeover, it's boom time for those exporting hit western programmes to the world's most populous nation.
China is the fastest-growing market for the sale of British shows and formats, with growth of 40% last year. While it is still relatively small in revenue terms, the opportunity is immense. “In the UK a top-rated TV show may just get into double-digit millions [in audience size], but China has 1.4 billion people and gets easily double, triple or quadruple that,” says Pierre Cheung, vice-president of greater China for BBC Worldwide. “The market is a massive opportunity.”
China's Got Talent, a local version of Simon Cowell's ITV hit, has seen viewers top 400 million an episode. Locally produced versions of western franchises combine the sheen of the exotic with the familiarity of local aesthetics. Singing competitions are especially popular: China's Got Talent, The Voice of China and a version of The X Factor (China's Strongest Voice) have all been major hits.
Last month the BBC unveiled China's take on Top Gear on national broadcaster Shanghai Dragon TV, featuring a double Olympic gold diving champion, the presenter of Chinese Idol and a pop star turned actor in place of British hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond.
These shows are strikingly different from their western counterparts. The Voice of China, the most popular show in 2013, began the nearly three-hour finale of its third season on 7 October with a soaring shot of the Great Wall; a voiceover praised China's thousands of years of history. The show then cut to testimonials from fans and former contestants: an elderly man, a middle-class family, a farmer, a foreign tourist in Tiananmen square.
“The Voice of China lets all of us music lovers bravely pursue our dreams,” said a man carrying a lute. Sentimental ballads are the order of the day. Judges are unwaveringly supportive.
Next up are remakes of documentary Educating Yorkshire and the potentially tricky prospect of a Chinese Big Brother. The sometimes risqué content that comes with Big Brother territory frequently lands the show in hot water with UK watchdog Ofcom – which has nothing on China's all-powerful State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, a notoriously twitchy regulator that acts as a cultural guardian.
It has pulled shows at the first hint of attitudes or depictions that show China or its people in a poor light. In 2011 it banned X Factor-style talent show Super Girl, which has attracted audiences of up to 400 million, and announced last autumn it would stop satellite TV stations from broadcasting more than one foreign-format show a year. Stations have replaced these programmes with others the government deems more acceptable, such as documentaries about Communist party history. The problem is that nobody wants to watch them.

There have been reports that the BBC's Sherlock, with Benedict Cumberbatch, was banned from major channels. However the BBC's Cheung denies this, saying it just took time for the show to move from airing on a Chinese video site to being broadcast on China's state broadcaster CCTV.
Martha Brass, chief operating officer at Big Brother producer Endemol, says careful collaboration with its partner Youku Tudou – China's answer to YouTube – will see a sanitised version make it past the censor. “In any country you obviously have to look at the cultural and regulatory environment, and we are well aware of that in relation to China,” they say. “Big Brother is actually a very flexible format. In the Philippines it is very much a family show, and in Australia we have run it in different time slots for different audiences. We feel confident about our ability to address the particular TV regulations in China.”
The rise of Chinese video services such as Sohu TV, Tencent and iQiyi has opened a huge new potential market for foreign programme rights ownersl.
The third series of Sherlock have notched up more than 70 million views online, while US show The Big Bang Theory, the most popular foreign show in China, has been viewed more than 1.4bn times on video sites.
“New media platforms are just starting to get into deals for more and more foreign shows,” says Paul Sandler, managing director of Objective Productions. “That could have a massive impact on the market for content.”
However the rise in online viewing, and the popularity of foreign shows has been seen as a threat by the state regulator. In April, video streaming websites were told to “clean up” and stop showing The Big Bang Theory as well as US shows The Good Wife, NCIS and The Practice. Shows that might be thought much more likely to outrage the watchdog – The Walking Dead, House of Cards and Breaking Bad – were unaffected.
As recently as three years ago China was considered something of a “Wild East” for foreign production companies, replete with tales of the impossibility of doing deals and a culture of ripping off hit foreign formats without paying for rights.
“If China wants to be taken seriously in the international market they have to treat intellectual property with proper respect,” says Sandler, who has done deals for three series of a Chinese version of gameshow The Cube. “There is a will from the government to have a proper IP protection structure; it is nowhere near as bad as it was a few years ago.”
Sandler believes that for the Chinese TV industry the aim is to collaborate and learn about how to develop hit shows that they can export.
China has some interesting homegrown hits, including a nationwide competition in the vein of Great British Bake Off but based on calligraphy; roughly translated, its title is Idiom Hero. But there is some way to go to make internationally appealing shows.
“The truth is the real aim of all the broadcasters and government in China is to develop homegrown Chinese shows and export them,” they say. “The same way as [they have] with cars, computers, white goods, you name it. We are trying to collaborate to come up with some genuinely good formats.”
Not everyone is impressed. For a market of 1.4 billion people, a total of £17m in sales of British programmes and formats in 2013 seems like a “long walk for a short drink”, says one senior UK TV executive. But Cheung counters that. They say it is a slow-burn culture about building relationships, and the real cash will follow: “You have to get involved and engage the partners personally; proper trust takes time. It is challenging but at same time exciting. If you can crack China, it makes any other market easy.”
UN Environment (UNEP) and electric racing series Formula E have partnered with one another to raise awareness of electric vehicles and their benefits.
In an announcement on Tuesday, UNEP said that the multi-year partnership would also look to educate future consumers of electric cars and challenge cities and governments to fight pollution.
UNEP said that it was hoped the popularity of the FIA's Formula E Championship – which sees fully electric vehicles race one another on courses across the globe – could be leveraged to boost awareness.
"Formula E puts a fresh spotlight on electric vehicles and is an exciting glimpse of what is to come - the age of clean, viable transport," Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment, said in a statement.
"Formula E and UN Environment share the aim to usher in this era and speed up acceptance of these technologies to combat air pollution," they added. "Air pollution has taken centre-stage this year as a serious public health threat, and with good reason."
When it comes to tackling air pollution, the mood does seem to be shifting. At the end of last year, for example, the mayors of four major cities – Mexico City, Madrid, Paris and Athens – pledged to ban diesel vehicles from their streets by 2025.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution represents a "major environmental risk to health." It adds that in 2014, 92 percent of the planet's population was living in areas where WHO air quality guidelines had not been met.
Do more public dollars flow to higher-income students attending public universities?
Some critics of the current public higher-education model say that because wealthier students are more likely to attend well-funded, top-tier public universities, these well-off students essentially receive a generous taxpayer-funded subsidy. Such critics also point to the fact that lower-income students tend to enroll at less-selective colleges that receive far less state support.
Two researchers released an analysis today challenging this argument. Instead, their calculations show that, at the national level, both groups effectively receive comparable amounts of public support to pursue their educations.
The focus on the types of colleges students of different economic backgrounds attend is important. While tuition and grants help students pay for college, those funds don't cover the full expenses needed for a university to provide an education. Those extra costs are referred to as “indirect subsidies”: state dollars that go straight to colleges and help to close the gap between the cost of educating a student and what might be paid in tuition and grants.
As a result, the authors of the report argue that looking at total student aid misses the nuances of college finance. For example, should research dollars—which tend to flow to more prestigious schools—count as an indirect subsidy? More importantly, is it fair to compare the per-pupil support rich and poor students receive based on the colleges they attend even when those two groups pay different tuition fees at the same institution? The report's authors don't think so, and they created a measurement based on two federal data sets that calculated the indirect subsidies minus what the students paid in tuition for the 2011-12 academic year. The result? “On average, in every category of selectivity, low-income students receive larger indirect subsidies because universities charge them lower net prices,” the authors wrote.
Jason Mantzoukas and Seth Rogen are reteaming for an episode of the latest — and last — season of The League. The show will once again showcase the two semi-detached cast members' onscreen alter-egos and fan favorites, Rafi and Dirty Randy. For those unfamiliar with FXX's sex-and-drugs-and-fantasy-football sitcom, Rafi is the insane, incest-minded brother-in-law of Nick Kroll's character Ruxin while Dirty Randy is a similarly unhinged pornographer — and librarian!
In the 2013 season, Mantzoukas and Rogen wrote and starred in an episode, “Rafi and Dirty Randy,” and did so again last year for an origin story called “When Rafi Met Randy,” which was set in a mental hospital. The previous two Rafi and Dirty Randy tales barely featured the show's core sextet of actors — Kroll, Mark Duplass, Katie Aselton, Stephen Rannazzisi, Paul Scheer, and Jon Lajoie — but executive producer Jackie Schaffer tells EW that this time around the show will also include the entire lead cast.
Even more importantly? According to Schaffer, who is also directing the episode, this latest Rafi and Dirty Randy adventure will be the craziest one to date. “If people think the last two Rafi/Dirty Randy episodes have shocked them, this is a whole new level,” says Schaffer, who created The League with their fellow EP and husband, Jeff. “It's practically inhuman.”
The League premieres Sept. 9 at 10 p.m. ET on FXX.

AIGLE, Switzerland (VN) — At nearly half the cost of its elder sibling, the supposedly second-tier Ultegra Di2 group is set to bring push-button electronic shifting to a much wider audience. Manufacturers are pricing Ultegra Di2-equipped bikes around $4,000 and up — not exactly cheap, but nowhere near the $8,000-$12,000 commonly asked for Dura-Ace Di2 models. And the new, cheaper option may actually be even better than its bank robber of an elder brother.
So when Shimano requested our presence in Aigle, Switzerland, home of the UCI, to give the group a good run through, we couldn't refuse. Plus the riding in Switzerland isn't half bad.
The specs Specifications for the new group have been detailed before. Actually, we got just about everything right in our first article last December. But here's a quick rundown anyway: Total weight for the full group, including non-electric bits like the cranks and brakes, is 2,482g. That's 80g more than mechanical Ultegra, 263g more than Dura-Ace Di2, 333g more than mechanical Dura-Ace, and 127g lighter than mechanical 105. Price is on par with Dura-Ace mechanical, around $2,500. Everything is a bit bigger and less sleek. Both derailleurs have chunkier sections that house the motor. The cables have changed, from four internal wires to two. This decreased their diameter, and the diameter of the connectors. The cables and connectors are also now completely waterproof, without the sleeves needed for Dura-Ace Di2. Two wiring harnesses are available, one for internal routing and one for external, both in multiple lengths. Dura-Ace Di2 and Ultegra Di2 are not compatible due to the different harnesses, though Dura-Ace Di2 should be getting the new harness type soon if the folks at Shimano are smart, and word is they are. The new smaller battery used on Dura-Ace Di2 is retained for Ultegra Di2. Important functions remain the same: front derailleur auto trim, 3000km (1,864 miles) battery life with 5,000 recharges (just try riding that much); identical button placement; same easy on-the-fly adjustment on the cable junction box. The hoods are now a bit thinner, more like the old 7800 shape but not as tall and with a flatter top.
Testing
Now, the good part. We wondered whether the massive drop in price would equate to an equivalent drop in quality.
With a few decent rides in the Swiss Alps and plenty of time tinkering with the stuff, I am confident in saying that, in fact, Ultegra Di2 is better than Dura-Ace Di2. That's right, better. For half the price. Not all that surprising really, since we are talking electronics here and just like my four-year-old iPhone, the latest generation does quite a bit more for less money. But the new group is impressive and exciting, nonetheless.
Despite what Shimano representatives say, the rear shifting on their Di2 systems — both of them — is a bit slower than mechanical options from all three major brands. That's largely because you can't dump gears with one swing of a lever: you need to tap the button for each shift. This is why I still race on SRAM Red: the rear shifting is tighter and crisper than Di2. I can upshift three gears at once, and I can pull the shift paddle into the bars for mid-sprint shifts. I also like the hood shape more. But all of that is just personal preference; I would be perfectly happy on a Di2 group as well.
Shifts with Di2 are always spot on, though, something that can't be said for even the best mechanical systems. Sometimes, in a state of fatigue, you just don't swing that little paddle quite far enough.
The front shifting with Di2 is undeniably the best available. Having ridden SRAM Red, Campagnolo Super Record 11, both Di2 systems, and Dura-Ace mechanical in the last few months, the Di2 comes out as the clear winner. The ability to shift from little ring to big ring while stamping out 500 watts is unrivaled. That performance is a function of the motorized derailleur itself, which can be built much stiffer than any mechanical derailleur. It's also why I think SRAM had better jump on the electronic bandwagon sooner rather than later: now that more riders will have access to Di2, that front shift quality will soon become the norm.
A few downsides
Before going into just why the apprentice has overcome its master, I should note a few flaws. First, the manufacturing tolerances used in the production of Ultegra Di2 are not as good as Dura-Ace Di2, which is still built in Japan. This, along with the lack of ti and carbon bits in Ultegra Di2, is a big reason for the difference in cost. It also means that Dura-Ace Di2 will age better than Ultegra Di2, keeping that new-bike feeling far longer into its life. So if you ride your bikes for 10 years, and expect to keep the same group that whole time, Dura-Ace Di2 may be the way to go.
Second, Ultegra Di2 is a bit heavier, but not by much, as noted above. In fact, if one takes out the non-electronic components, it only loses about 104g to Dura-Ace Di2. So run a Dura-Ace crank, brakes and cassette and you gain less than a quarter of a pound while saving thousands of dollars.
Why Ultegra Di2 is better than Dura-Ace
Cost is a huge consideration here. The difference in quality simply doesn't mirror the price difference between the two groups. And as noted above, with some easy component swaps there doesn't need to be much of a weight penalty, either.
There are places where Ultegra Di2 is simply better, and more advanced. For example, the number of micro-adjustment stops used to tune the rear derailleur has been increased from 24 to 30 total, meaning more precise tuning.
The asupervisorstioned new cable harness is a nice improvement as well, allowing for smaller holes in frames and simpler setup, plus it's completely water proof right out of the box. No more shrink-wrap tubing. Ultegra Di2 will also be compatible with a new Shimano diagnostic tool, which will be mostly owned by shops I imagine, and can easily diagnose the entire setup while it's still on your bike just by plugging it into a laptop. It can pick out shorts or other problems immediately, and send your mechanic looking in the right places for a problem. It's also possible to change the function of each button, if one desired. Dura-Ace Di2 can only plug in one component at a time.
Last, but certainly not least, is the fact that shift performance on the bike is largely indistinguishable from Dura-Ace Di2. Rear shifting is still crisp and on-command, and the front shifting is astounding coming off a mechanical system. A few journalists who had never ridden Di2 before were giggling with glee as they mashed out of the saddle up alpine climbs while shifting easily between their 39 and 53 tooth front chainrings. Until you've experienced the front shift quality that Shimano has brought to both Di2 systems, your life as a tech-nerd cyclist remains unfulfilled.
Shimano does still need to update its accessory shift buttons and TT shifters to the new wiring harness. Once those bits become available, Dura-Ace Di2 will truly be left behind.
The scoop
It's up to riders to decide what group is right for them. Red, Super Record, Dura-Ace mechanical, or either Di2 system are all spectacularly good. Ultegra mechanical is great, as is SRAM Force. SRAM Rival is damn near unbeatable for the price.
Theis a landlocked country in central Europe bordering Slovakia, Poland, Germany and Austria. It is a land of rolling countrysides, wooded hills and fertile valleys. The climate is temperate, but summers are warm and winters are fairly cold. The country is highly industrialised with machinery, cars, iron and steel, chemicals, fertilizers, glass, ceramics and clothing. The tourist industry is rapidly growing.
The about 10.400.000 Czech live in an area of about 79.000 square kilometers and languages spoken are Czech, Moravian and Slovak. In the bigger cities some persons speak German and/or English.
Whether you are there to experience stunning Prague, or merely there for the excellent beer, there is no denying that the Czech Republic is one of the highlights of Eastern Europe. While there is much to entertain and amuse in the capital, exploring the rest of the country has its own rewards.
From the caves of the Moravian Karst to the beautifully preserved town of Cesky Krumlov, the Czech Republic a delightful mixture of Bohemian art, historical castles and attractive nature.
Start with Prague, widely regarded as the most beautiful city in Europe. Add the Bohemian and Moravian countryside, dotted with castles and rivers. Throw in a sprinkling of famous names (Kundera, Kafka) and a claim on the original Budweiser, and you'll get the golden child of Eastern Europe.
Stunning architecture and cheap beer are the top reasons cited for a trip to Prague; an international ad campaign, EU accession and the continuing rise of budget airlines and stag parties make sure the city's hotels remain booked solid.
Trifter is your one-stop resource for finding a hotel room or to see what else this fine country has to offer. If you manage to escape the clutches of Prague, try to make it to the beautiful town of Českż Krumlov, which slumbers seductively in a coil of the Vltava River.
A 48-year-old farmer committed suicide by consuming poison at Sadhpur village in the district after they were unable to withdraw cash from the bank for their son's wedding.
Police said Satish Kumar was rushed to hospital yesterday in a serious condition after consuming poison, where they were declared dead.
Their family said they had been worried about not being able to get cash for the wedding despite standing in long queues.
Meanwhile, the cash crunch triggered by demonetization has prompted a man in Miranpur town in the district to drastically downsize their daughter's wedding ceremony. There were only four 'baraatis', besides the groom at the wedding. The guests also had to make do with a simple meal after the 'nikaah'.
Maqbool Ahmed was advised by their relatives to postpone the wedding, but went ahead with a humble ceremony.
In my previous article, Expansion Team Success Part 1, I briefly covered how expansion teams performed in their inaugural seasons. For this article, I've created a few charts that help to better illustrate the previous information.
First is a chart that shows exactly what the previous article covered. You can see that the Inaugural season has rarely been very successful for a team and that it's more common to finish near the bottom than even the middle of the pack.
After posting part one, I was sent a question that asked why I was focusing on “if a team made it to the Cup playoff or not for expansion team success” when any team could have good fantasy players? My initial thought was that a team that finished higher in the overall rankings (thus making the Cup) would have higher fantasy point totals.
So I put this to the test by looking at the last two fantasy seasons and adding up the total points that each team's players generated. Here are two charts that took the total fantasy points each team earned and compared them to the place the team finished overall. If a team made the playoffs, their point total was highlighted in green.
You can see that, the teams with higher fantasy point totals did indeed have a better chance at making the playoffs. Looking back to the previous chart, you'll remember that expansion teams tend to finish near the bottom in their inaugural year.
It's also worth pointing out that this relationship of points to playoff appearance gets a little fuzzy as you get to the bottom of the list of playoff teams. This is due to how the teams are chosen from each Conference.
Conclusion
So does this mean that you should stay away from NYCFC and Orlando? I believe the answer is Yes, at least at the start of the season. On average it's taken expansion teams 2.1 seasons to make it to the playoffs (Toronto Excluded) and while the weakening of the Eastern Conference does provide a better chance for NYCFC and Orlando to make one of those bottom playoff spots, the players from the teams with a better chance of finishing near the top of the table are who I would look at first.
Of course, I'm not saying avoid a good value. Each of these teams has some very well established fantasy go-to players and some of the unknown former USL Pro players at Orlando could have some attractive price points. Just limit it to one per team until we have more information.
Finally, just for fun, here's a chart of how long it took teams to reach the playoffs after they joined the league. Enjoy and feel free to contact me or leave a comment with any questions. Or reply to the post on /r/FantasyMLS.

An elderly woman committed suicide by jumping into a crocodile pit at the Samut Prakarn Crocodile Farm & Zoo.
Wanpen Inyai, 65, left their home on Rom Klao Road in Bangkok's Min Buri district on Friday morning and no one in their family could contact them afterward. They aren't found until after they had jumped into the pit housing more than 1,000 crocodiles that afternoon.
Police were not able to identify the deceased and contact their family until Saturday morning after Wanpen's 30-baht universal-healthcare card was found floating on the water's surface.
A picture taken by an unidentified person captures a crocodile approaching the body of Wanpen Inyai, 65, at the Samut Prakarn Crocodile Farm & Zoo where they committed suicide.
The result of DNA testing of tissue taken from the corpse would be known in a month, said Pol Col Preecha Iamnui, Muang Samut Prakarn police investigator. Witnesses saw the woman intentionally jumped into the croc pond and footage from a security camera confirmed they left their shoes on a walkway before making the fatal jump.
The officer said when they arrived at the scene, farm owners and staff were trying to use long sticks to ward off dozens of crocodiles tearing at their body. But by then it was too late.
Sunan Tharmnat, Wanpen's sister, said the victims had been depressed and did not talk to anyone for several days before they disappeared.
They and family members went to file a missing-person's report with Rom Klao police the day they went missing, but were told to wait 24 hours, as required by law.
Crocodile farm executives denied published accusations that they tried to cover up the suicide and asked Wanpen's family members to keep the incident quiet. They said they alerted police immediately after learning of the incident and the deceased's family thought the death was suicide.
A picture of Wanpen's body being approached by a crocodile was circulated on the Internet over the weekend.
Farm owner Uthen Youngprapakorn told the Jor Sor 100 traffic radio station on Monday the pit in which Wanpen jumped was about 2-3 metres deep and covered an area of about five rais.
It was not a pit used for a crocodile show and unfortunately staff could not rescue the woman. They said the farm had already installed additional strong fences and other security measures along the walkway. They described last week's suicide as a force majeure and expressed condolences to the woman's family.

A bit ago, I popped into an “Explain Like I'm 5” thread to give my version of the differences between C, C++, Objective-C and C#. In true Reddit fashion, I had the requisite “no five year old could understand this” comments and similar noise. One thing that leapt out to me was that a few commenters objected to this statement: “Programming is hard.”
The most thorough objection read like this:
Programming is not hard(such a discouraging label). If you learned a written language, you can learn a computer language. The only thing difficult about programming is mastering the art of learning itself, which is what separates the soon-to-be obsoletes from the ever-evolving masters of the trade. Good programming, at its heart, is all about keeping up with the technologies of the industry. The fundamentals themselves are easy peasy. – /u/possiblywithdynamite
Now, I don't want to pick on /u/possiblywithdynamite specifically, although I do want to point out that “keeping up with the technologies of the industry” is the exact opposite of good programming. I'd also like to add that a positive attitude towards “life-long learning” is neccessary to be successful in general, not just programming. I don't want to get sidetracked by those points.
Instead, I want to focus on a few other related things:
Programming is hard
Skill has value
Programming should be hard
That doesn't mean we can't make programming accessible to non-programmers
Now, what do we mean by “hard”? There's the obvious definition: you have to do a lot of work to succeed. Time and energy have to be invested. Or, it's a task that requires great skill and talent. These are our common ideas of “hard”, and they're more what I meant in my original comment, but I want to highlight an alternate definition of “hard”.
A task is hard when there are more ways to screw it up than to do it correctly. If you're blundering through the world of programming and software development, there are a lot more ways to be wrong than there are to be right. Most of what we do on this site is inventory all the ways in which people can mangle basic tasks. Think about how many CodeSODs work but are also terrible.
When we talk about learning a skill—be it programming, a musical instrument, writing, improvised comedy, etc.—what we're really talking about is building habits, patterns, and practices that help us do things correctly more often than we do them wrong. And how do we do that? Usually by screwing up a bunch of times. Improvisers call this “getting your reps”, musicians call it “going to the woodshed” (because your playing is so awful you need to be away from the house so as not to disturb your family). As the old saying goes, “An expert is someone who has failed more times than a novice has even tried.” The important thing is that you can read up on best practices and listen to experts, but if you want to get good at something hard, you're going to need to screw up a bunch. We learn best from failures.
Okay, so programming is hard, and we can deal with its inherent difficulty by building skill. But should programming be hard? After all, haven't we spent the past few decades finding ways to make programming easier?
Well, I don't want to imply that we should make programming hard just for the sake of making it hard. I don't want to give the impression that we should all throw out our garbage collectors and our application frameworks and start making hand-crafted artisanal Assembly. Keep in mind how I defined hard: lots of ways to screw up, but only a few ways to succeed. That means difficulty and degrees of freedom are related. The more options and flexibility you have, the harder everything has to be.
Let's shift gears. I didn't learn to ride a bike until relatively late compared to my peers. As was standard at the time, my parents bought me a small bike and put training wheels on it. I was just awful at it. I'd fall over even with the training wheels on. I hated it, but for a kid too young to drive in the “yes, you can go out by yourself” era of the 80s, being able to ride a bike was a freedom I desperately wanted.
At some point, my parents decided I was too old for training wheels, so they took them off. “Sink or swim,” my dad said. And it was amazing, because I almost instantly got better. Within a few days, I was riding like I was born to it. Cheerfully running errands down to the corner shop, riding back and forth to school, it was everything I wanted.
Little did I know that training wheels are considered harmful.
To learn to bike, you must solve two problems: the pedaling problem and the balance problem. Training wheels only solve the pedaling problem—that is, the easy one. Learning to balance on a bike is much more difficult, and a “training” tool that eliminates the need to balance is worse than beside the point.
Which brings us to languages like Scratch and Blockly. Now, these are educational “toy” languages with syntax training wheels. You cannot write a syntactically incorrect program in these languages. You simply aren't permitted by the editor. I am not a child educator, so I can't speak to how effective it is as an educational tool. But these sorts of visual languages aren't limited to educational languages. There's SSIS and Windows Workflow. MacOS has Automator. I still see Pointy-Haired Bosses looking for UML diagrams before anybody writes a line of code.
It's not just “visual” languages. Think about “simple” languages like JavaScript, PHP, VB. Think about the worst sin Microsoft ever committed: putting a full-featured IDE in their Office suite. In all these cases, the languages attempt to constrain your options, provide faster feedback, and make a “best guess” about what you're trying to do. They try to steer you around some of the common mistakes by eschewing types, simplifying syntax, and cutting back on language features.
I am not trying to say that these languages are bad. I'm not trying to say that they don't have a place. I definitely don't want this to sound like Ivory Tower Elitism. That's not the point I want to make. What I am saying is that simplifying languages by helping the users solve the easy problems and not the hard ones is a mistake.
Beyond that point, programming needs to be hard. Let's focus on syntax. I remember in my first C++ class, I spent days—literal days— hunting for a semicolon. That's a huge hurdle for a beginner, struggling with no progress and unhelpful feedback. Languages that simplify their syntax, that forgive missing semicolons, seem like a pretty natural way to bypass that difficult hump.
Here's the problem, though: once you understand how to think syntactically, syntax itself isn't really a bother. There's a hump, but the line flattens off quickly. Learning a new language syntax ceases to be a challenge. By taking the training wheels off, you're going to fail more often—and failing is how you learn. You can find more things to do, and more ways to do them, without having to start over—because you built strong habits. More than that, you can't avoid the importance of syntax. At some point, your application will need to interact with data, and that data will need to be structured. We're often going to wrap that structure in some kind of syntax.
This is just an illustration of the general problem. Making a hard task easier means giving up flexibility and freedom. Our tools become less expressive, and less powerful, as a result. The users of those tools become less skilled. They're less able to navigate past the bad solutions because the bad solutions aren't even presented to them.
Now, if this ended here, it'd be in danger of being a grognard-screed. “My powerful-but-opaque-and-incomprehensible-tooling isn't the problem, you just need to ‘git gud'.” I emphatically do not want this to be read that way, because I strongly believe that programming and software development need to be accessible. In the wilderness of incorrect solutions, someone with little or no experience should be able to muddle through and see progress towards a goal. I don't want the IT field to be a priesthood of experts who require initiates to undergo arcane rituals before they can be considered “worthy”.
Hard means it's easy to screw up. Accessible means that there are some sign-posts that well help keep you on the path. These are not mutually exclusive. Off the top of my head, here are a few things that we can keep in mind when designing languages, tools, and tutorials:
Incremental Complexity : Each option a user has is another option to screw up. You've made their lives harder. That doesn't mean you should take options away, but it does mean that you should present the options gradually. Concepts in your language, tool, or tutorial should stand alone or build on simpler concepts. There are so many designs that miss this.

Glider Bikes, not Training Wheels : If you're constraining degrees of freedom, if you're nerfing your tool to avoid certain kinds of mistakes, you need to understand why. What's the benefit? What habits do you want your users to build? This goes from things like building a visual syntax to even things like using garbage-collected memory. I'd argue that, by and large, garbage collection is a good thing.

Visualizations are Good : Right now, I'm trying to wrap my head around TensorFlow, Google's Neural Network API. I'd be lost without TensorBoard, which takes your dataflow and creates a diagram of it. In general, providing an understanding of a program in multiple ways is good. Code is always truth, but UML diagrams aren't terrible (until they're used as a specification instead of a visualization).

Signpost All The Things! : Signposts aren't just warnings of danger, they're also guides. If you want to get from here to there, go this way, not that way. These take the form of clear error messages, excellent tutorials, and useful libraries and functions. An implementation of the Builder pattern isn't just a great way to design an API, it's a great way to show someone how to design their own APIs. This also encapsulates the idea of “affordances”: the design of a thing tells you instantly how to use the thing.

Be Unsurprising: If I'm in the unknown, I don't know if I'm doing the right or the wrong thing. And if there are surprises in store, I'm going to get even more confused. A surprise is anything that's different, and I don't like things that are different.
Also, don't lie. Programming is hard. That might be a “discouraging” label, but it's an accurate label. What's more discouraging, going: “This is hard, but here's how you can get started,” or “This is easy (but it's actually hard and you're going to fail more often than you succeed)”?
Phew. This turned into a much longer piece than I imagined it would be. As developers, we're constantly building tools for others to use: other developers, our end users, and maybe even aspiring developers. Understanding what makes something hard, and why it's sometimes good for things to be hard, is important. Recognizing that we can deal with difficult problems by building skills, by practicing and honing our craft, means that we also have to recognize the value of being skilled.
Lithuania Intelligence Agency VSD (Valstybes Saugumo Departamentas) has published a report accusing Russia and Belarus of infiltrating the nation's armed forces.
In the annual report, it warned of an “aggressive Russian foreign policy”, and that Russian intelligence was highly active among Lithuanian society.
According to the report, both Russia and Belarus may be attempting to plant informants among Lithuanian armed forces and those of other Baltic states to gather information on army structure, rank, as well as NATO organisation and protocols.
In early 2016 Lithuanian army paramedic Andrey Osurkov was convicted of espionage on behalf of Belarus, and sentenced to three years in prison.
In addition, the VSD claimed that Russia was actively seeking ways to conduct pro-Russian propaganda campaigns across the Baltic states – in particular via state-run agency Sputnik.
Lithuania highlights border concerns
The report accused Russia of trying to create a favourable climate for Russia, and to stir up anti-Western sentiment. It concluded that many of the activities were being carried out by members of the Russian diplomatic mission to Lithuania in Vilnius.
The VSD also commented that the Russian Security Service (FSB) is taking advantage of the many people who engage in cross-border shopping to take advantage of cheaper prices. The intelligence agency stated that the FSB brings “fictitious or actual charges” frequently, incentivising citizens to cooperate with intelligence gathering schemes in order to continue border crossings.

An increase in drone activity around the border with Lithuania also gave rise for concern, both for intelligence gathering and potential illegal border crossings.
The report for 2015 also voiced ongoing concerns about Russian activity in Ukraine, noting that it was undertaking a large propaganda campaign there, infiltrating community meets, clubs, and churches.
SVD concluded in the report (Lithuanian) that the best method for tackling perceived Russian interference was to raise public awareness on the issue, thereby “raising citizens' resistance to ideological manipulation”.

Ride the Crashing Wave
Magic is wild. Magic is undisciplined. You can try to impose order and understanding on it, but that's just surface. Underneath is chaos, an erratic heart beating to a staggering rhythm. You don't control it, any more than a surfer controls twenty-meter-tall wave; you don't direct the wave, you ride it, capture a piece of its power, and hope to survive. If you do it right, though, you catch a portion of unimaginable power—power those who control the Sixth World don't want you to have. All the more reason to push past their boundaries and grab it.
Forbidden Arcana offers dozens of different ways for Awakened characters in Shadowrun to harness that power and make themselves a mana-slinger like no other. From new ways to distinguish spellcasters of different traditions to more chaotic methods for summoning spirits to options for Awakened characters who have mastered their craft, Forbidden Arcana shows players how to break out of conventional molds, use mana in new ways, and become true street legends riding the growing wave of Sixth World mana.
Forbidden Arcana is an advanced magic rulebook for use with Shadowrun, Fifth Edition; magic concepts from the book can be used with Shadowrun: Anarchy, though mechanics for that game are not included.
Return on investment: 6150%
Budget $6 million (inflation-adjusted)
Gross revenue $369 million
My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a 2002 romantic comedy that women loved and their boyfriends suffered through. The story of a Greek-American woman's relationship with a non-Greek man and the clash of civilizations that ensues was made on a very small budget and opened in limited release. But its performance grew slowly and steadily, and the movie developed over time into a popular crowd-pleaser that far exceeded expectations.
Despite its status as a small independent film, and despite never holding the number one spot at the box office, the movie went on to earn almost $369 million, a staggering, unbelievable return of over sixty-one times on its investment. For that reason, My Big Fat Greek Wedding is the most profitable film of all time.

Plans to demolish part of the historic Smithfield Market in central London have been rejected by the government.
Henderson Global Investors wanted to knock down part the markets in Farringdon and replace it with an office and retail development.
But ministers agreed with the planning inspector that the benefits were "not enough to outweigh the potential harm to an area of such historic value".
The Victorian Society also welcomed the decision.
Some of the Victorian buildings have been derelict for 30 years and there were plans to replace them with a public piazza with restaurants and cafes, as well as multi-storey office blocks.
Image copyright Henderson Global Investors Image caption The plans included cafes and a multi-storey office space
The areas proposed for demolition were formerly used as a general market and fish market.
Chris Costelloe, director of the Victorian Society, said: "These buildings are vital to the character of Smithfield and to the commercial, industrial and architectural history of the City of London.
"Buildings like Smithfield general market are what make the City such a special place."
They added that following the decision a revamp of the market should be encouraged to repair the "magnificent" buildings.
The developers have six weeks to appeal against the decision by making an application to the High Court.
It is the second time a bid to redevelop the western end of Smithfield market has failed.
In 2008, an attempt to knock down the general market and replace it with an office block was refused planning permission.

HAVANA, Cuba, Apr 11 (ACN) The fourth edition of the Business Fair will be held in Expocuba from May 10 to 25, which will allow all economic entities in the country to explore the potentialities of the domestic market, strengthen their relationships and diversify the offers.
René Hernández, Deputy Minister of Economy and Planning, informed Cuban News Agency that, as on previous occasions, the Superior Business Management Organizations (OSDE), Provincial Administration Councils, state companies and joint ventures, wholesale traders, non-agricultural cooperatives and self-employed.
As part of the process of preparing the 2018 Plan, the vice-president explained that the event, whose registration is already open, will allow negotiating offers and services that will guarantee the productive processes planned for the coming year in Cuba.
However, Hernández insisted that the meeting is, above all, an ideal opportunity to establish or strengthen short-term links, to know each other more, to "compete fraternally", to identify reserves and possibilities for expansion, and thus to substitute imports, a very important goal given the current scenario of financial constraints the country faces.
Based on the new powers granted to the Cuban business system, it was recalled that the entities can decide which secondary and support activities, derived from their social object, they are in a position to develop, or even to market their surplus or non-operations at the price determined by the relation between supply and demand.
Even - they pointed out - during the fair, companies can prioritize among their objectives the treatment of their idle and slow moving inventories, in conditions to be reoriented towards other activities.
In a scenario where non-state forms of management continue to grow, the forthcoming business exchange will also enable them to establish and diversify their contractual links with legal entities, one of the difficulties still present and limiting their progress, as they have stated in several times these economic actors.
According to official data, by the end of 2016, there were just over 535,000 self-employed workers and 397 non-agricultural cooperatives in Cuba, mainly engaged in trade and repair of personal effects, restaurants, construction and in manufacturing.
Saving Throws: Your techniques require your target to make saving throws to resist the effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
Mastery Points: Gain a pool of points which fuel your arcane-imbued techniques, equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your swordmage level. You regain your expended Mastery Points during a short rest spent focusing on your bonded blade and practicing forms.
As part of your swordbond, the potential you have unlocked is expressed in Mastery Points which increase with your study and focus as a swordmage.
You create a bond to the blade you wield which keeps you from being separated. If you perform the swordbond ritual with your blade during a long rest, you will be able to determine the direction and approximate distance away your blade lies, and as a bonus action, you can summon it to your hand from up to a mile away.
A swordmage has a special relationship with the blade that they or they have carried, and through dedication and study, has unlocked the potential to utilize arcane abilities through the weapon itself
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
As a reaction when an enemy hits an ally within 15 feet of you that you can see, reduce the damage dealt to your ally by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your swordmage level.
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
As a reaction when an enemy attacks an ally within 15 feet of you that you can see, teleport the enemy adjacent to you and make an opportunity attack against the enemy.
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
As part of your attack action, you may teleport to an area you can see up to 15 feet adjacent to a foe prior to making your attack. If your attack hits, add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll.
You adopt a particular bond with your blade as your focus. Choose one of the Aegis below which will allow you to take swift, decisive action against a foe.
You do not start with any specialized equipment. Your travels and adventures have outfitted you with the gear and specialty items that have leaded you to adopt the training of a swordmage already.
Swordmages exist as a very small fragment of those who can wield both a blade and the arcane. Their focus is mainly on becoming one with the blade, and in the meditation and study as well as the familiarity with the arcane may unlock a certain potential that will allow the wielder to become more powerful than previously thought possible.
Imbued Technique
At 1st level, when you make an attack, you are able to channel a small part of the arcane energy you possess to enhance the weapon's attack to some additional effect. Choose one of the techniques below to add to your swordmage abilities.
Thundering Attack: Expend one Mastery point as part of an Attack action. If the attack hits, the attack deals extra thunder damage equal to your Intelligence modifier and if the target is Large or smaller, it must pass a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
Lightning Lure: Expend one Mastery point as part of an Attack action. If the attack hits, the target must pass a Wisdom saving throw and you may move up to 15 feet away from the attacker. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the target, and if the target fails its saving throw, it must follow you to an adjacent spot. The target also grants advantage on the next attack against it.
If the target passes the saving throw, you are unable to retreat, and the target does not follow. If the target is immobilized or otherwise cannot move, this has no effect.
Disorienting Shout: Expend one Mastery point as part of an Attack action. If the attack hits, the target takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier and must make Intelligence save or fall prone.
Arcane Understanding
Learn two cantrips of your choice off the wizard cantrip list. Your spellcasting ability for these cantrips is Intelligence.
Thundering Step
As part of your move, you may teleport up to 25 feet away from your current location to an unoccupied location that you can see, subtracting one foot of movement for every foot teleported.
When the teleport is completed, all creatures adjacent to you must make a Strength saving throw or take thunder damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you have completed a short or long rest.
Arcane Aura
At 2nd level, you are able to focus your arcane energies in to a maelstrom of emotion which effects those around you. Choose one of the auras below to add to your swordmage abilities.
At 2nd level, the aura is a 10 foot radius around you. At 5th level, the aura increases to 15 feet.
You can start the aura as a bonus action on your turn if you expend two Mastery points. The aura lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action.
Focused Coordination: Allies that attack an enemy within 5 feet of you that you can see gain advantage on their attacks while this aura is in effect.
Dogged Advance: Enemies that you have attacked within the last turn who are within the aura must focus their next attack on their turn on you, or gain disadvantage on their next attack.
Nightmarish Visage: Enemies that end their turn in your aura must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of their next turn. At the end of their next turn, if they are still frightened, they may repeat the Wisdom save.
If the enemy passes the saving throw, they are immune to the effect of the aura.
Spellblade
When you take the Attack action with your bonded blade, you may cast a cantrip as a bonus action, using the blade as your arcane focus.
Energized Blade
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel arcane energy directly in to the core of your weapon itself. Choose one ability from the list below and add it to your swordmage abilities.
Scintillating Strike: Expend two Mastery points as part of an Attack action. If the attack hits, the target takes additional lightning damage equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your swordmage level and the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
Icy Thrust: Expend two Mastery points as part of an Attack action. If the attack hits, the target takes additional cold damage equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your swordmage level and the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be immobilized until the end of its next turn.
Terrible Conflagration: Expend two Mastery points as part of an Attack action. If the attack hits, the target takes additional fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your swordmage level and the target must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you.
Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two different ability scores by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability above 20 using this feature.
Channeling Flow
As a spell-like ability, cast fireball, lightning bolt, or haste as a third level spell. Intelligence is your casting ability for this spell.
Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you have completed a long rest.
Stance of the Eldritch Blades
At 5th level, you become one with the blade and arcane energies, allowing you to lose yourself in the forms.
As an action, you may enter the Stance of the Eldritch Blades. It lasts for 1 minute or can be dismissed at any time.
When you enter the Stance of the Eldritch Blades, gain +2 to your AC and resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. At the end of each of your turns, if you have hit a target with one of your swordmage abilities, regain one Mastery point.
Attacks made while in this stance that do not use Mastery points to augment them do additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.
On their “WallBuilders Live” radio program today, David Barton fielded a question from a listener who will be serving as a delegate to the Republican convention but feels that they cannot support the nomination of Donald Trump. The listener asked Barton if there is anything that delegates can do to stop the nomination of Trump, to which Barton replied that Christians should simply accept that Trump is “God's guy” in this election.
Barton, who has already made clear that they will be voting for Trump despite the fact that they ran a super PAC supporting Ted Cruz, explained that since Christians were very active in the Republican primaries, they must conclude that Trump's victory was part of God's plans.
“One thing I know for sure is that in the race of primaries, we had a lot really good God guys in there,” Barton said. “And we had a huge turnout of professing Christians and evangelicals and others, so there is nothing to complain about that we didn't get a voice, we didn't get a candidate. We had great candidates to choose from and this is who the people chose, and this is who the people chose with a really high turnout of evangelicals. So I kind of look back and say, ‘Hmmm, I wonder where God's fingerprint is in this?' because this is not necessarily a failure of the church.”
“This may not be our preferred candidate, but that doesn't mean it may not be God's candidate to do something that we don't see,” they said. “We may look back in a few years and say, ‘Wow, they really did some things that none of us expected.' So I am fully open to the possibility that because we did everything as Christians that we could, we can't complain about our turnout, we can't complain about our quality of candidates, and this is what the people chose; I'm a whole lot more open to the fact that God may have something going here that is much bigger than what we think or see.”
Not so long ago, I've eventually decided to dive into the world of microservices.
I did look for an opportunity to make use of this architectural pattern for quite some time and finally was able to do so.
After 3 months of trying out the new things and learning stuff mostly on my own (the hard way) I believe it's a good time to share some of my experience. I have no doubts that at some point in the future when I look back at this post I might be like – “oh God, what was I thinking back then, it's so wrong”, but well, let me show you what did I learn so far and maybe you won't repeat some of my mistakes.
Before we begin, let me just quickly “warn” you that what you're about to read was not written by someone having tons of experience in designing the distributed systems. Although I'm not a total newbie in this area, I'm far from being an experienced system architect either, so just keep that in mind. Finally, let's start with the core approach to the system design, which is defined as following:
System design
API
Usually, you would create HTTP API that should act as a gateway, with no business logic defined whatsoever. Its most important job is to dispatch queries & commands via service bus without having any idea about the other services except the storage one which is being used for retrieving the data (which eventually will be returned to the end-user).
Of course, you might need to include some authentication mechanism here that will differentiate whether the requests are being sent by an anonymous user or not (usually via some token authentication included in HTTP header).
Storage
As the name states, it's a kind of service responsible storing the data (like a read-only database). It acts as a sort of bridge between the API and the other microservices. Since the API has no idea what the heck is going on behind the service bus, in order to retrieve any data it sends the requests to the storage service. The storage service, on the other hand, has no idea about the API, yet does know about the microservices in case there's a need to fetch the data which is not available in its internal database.
I do realize that you might wonder – why would you create a separate service acting as a data storage? Isn't having a separate database that the API can talk to directly a good enough solution? Well, it really depends on what are you trying to achieve. It certainly might be a good and sufficient solution, but think about the following scenario – in order to store objects in a read-only database (CQRS stuff here) you most likely need to subscribe to all sorts of the events like UserCreated, InvoicePaid etc. Then you need to talk to a specific (micro)service, fetch the data and save it into the database. In the former scenario your API would be responsible for subscribing the events, mapping the data and saving it into the database – is that wrong? Most, certainly not, however, I prefer the latter solution which is a full separation of the API from the microservices.
In that case, there's a so-called storage service that subscribes to the events, fetches the data from the (micro)services, knows how to flatten the objects etc. The API only needs to perform the HTTP requests to the Storage service in order to get the data – and it doesn't really care whether it comes from some internal database or cache or some service that is located at the end of the world. Like I said – both solution are viable, both of them have their pros and cons, but personally I really like to keep the API clean and remove any unnecessary logic from it, which in that scenario would be subscribing to the events and storing the data on top of dispatching the commands.
Services
The core of the system where each service is a totally separate “being” from each other service, period. They (services) have no idea that there's someone else in the world listening to the commands and events dispatched by themselves. Each (micro)service does possess its own domain models, repositories, business logic and so on. The only thing that is common for the whole infrastructure are the service bus and a set of commands & events.
Now, that we have a rather (at least I hope so) clear picture about the system, here are some of my remarks related to the idea per se and some implementation details.
Tips & tricks
Keep your services small.
It's better to have many small microservices that focus on a single domain than a few bloated ones that perform totally different tasks & manage unrelated responsibilities under the same scope. The most usual examples would be: creating/validation the user accounts, sending the messages, managing products, handling the payments etc. and each domain would fit into a separate service with its unique entities.
Follow the CQRS pattern.
Send the commands that have no return values, and perform queries that are idempotent – that's all you need to follow the CQRS. If you stick to this pattern, you will quickly find out that it's much easier to scale your applications simply by separating read & write operations.
Share commands, events and DTOs.
Create a shared project where you will keep commands, events and DTO (data transfer objects) used within the whole system. You may also include here some helper methods, extensions etc. – just make sure you don't put there any specific domain models or business logic.
Organize your workflows by using events & command.
Thanks to the commands (that you can think of requests being sent by the end-users) which may produce the events (and so on), you can easily create very complex processes if you need to. The services shouldn't talk to each other at all, as it does introduce tight coupling. Instead, publish additional commands and events.
Choose a database that suits service needs.
Each service (not a single instance, because you may have many instances of the same service running on different nodes) should have its own database. Not only you will eliminate a single point of failure (a single, huge database for the whole system) but most importantly you will have a freedom to pick the best database for the particular tasks. You might want to use SQL for some financial operations which rely heavily on transactions or NoSQL database for storing billions of JSON documents.
Track the information about requests being processed.
Whenever you dispatch a command to the service bus, assign to it some meaningful information like id, name etc. and store it somewhere. Thanks to this, you will be quickly able to determine whether it has succeeded or not. Personally, I create a separate (micro)service that subscribes to all of the important commands & events and stores the information about performed requests within its internal database. For example, there's a CreateUser command, it gets some unique ID and state equals to “created” and once the user was created there's a UserCreated event being published which contains ID of its parent command, therefore I'm able to update the requests that e.g. to “succeeded”.
Adjust your end-client apps to the asynchronous processing.
Once you send a request to the API you will not receive an instant response, at least not in a synchronous way that you might be accustomed to.
For example, I return a 202 Accepted HTTP status code with some custom header containing the URL of the unique operation (described in the previous paragraph). Then, the end-user can fetch operation state and once it's completed the resource will become available to use.
Ensure you can easily deploy a new instance of the service.
The beauty of a good (micro)services architecture is having an ability to quickly scale required services in order to handle the increased load.
If you can't simply deploy a service to the new server without interfering the other parts of your system it means that something ain't right.
Write end-to-end tests.
I believe that having end-to-end tests is a crucial part of the system being built with (micro)services. There's hardly any another way to ensure that everything works as expected until you can run some E2E tests (e.g by using HttpClient that will send raw HTTP Requests to the API and validate the received response).
Include failover, service discovery and other useful mechanisms.
Whenever something goes wrong, you want to make sure that your whole system doesn't crash, or at least part of it. Make sure you have some retry policies included (e.g. Polly), service discovery tools such as Consul and also keep your credentials in some centralized place e.g. using Vault, Azure Key Vault or my open source project Lockbox.
With development on the next Battlefront game in full swing, it looks like the project may be reaching a playable state.
That's because a playtest for what is likely the Battlefront sequel will be happening in Stockholm, Sweden on March 9.
Posted on the EA Playtesting Facebook page and noticed by Elliot of BattlefrontUpdates, this event is for a “Star Wars™ Battlefront session at EA DICE”:
If you are interested in getting a chance to play the game, you can fill out the form via this link.
Note that you'll likely need to be local to the Stockholm area to be selected. You also can't be in an occupation of the following: Journalism, Public Relations, Video Game Development, Marketing, or Market Research.
As development on the 2015 Battlefront is more or less completed, it doesn't make too much sense for EA to be holding a playtest of that game. Instead, this playtest may very well be for an early alpha build of EA's second Battlefront game.
I wouldn't expect any sort of news regarding this game to come from this playtest. Those that attend will be subject to non-disclosure agreements and so probably shouldn't be leaking information.
It may also be a while until more of the general public gets to play the game. For comparison's sake, EA's first Battlefront entered a closed alpha on July 2 in 2015 and the open beta didn't happen until October 8.
However, it's still quite cool to see that the sequel is basically in a playable (but early) state. Hopefully that means we will actually get a good look at it soon!

Gun owners are taking on the Obama administration over a new rule they say would trample their Second Amendment rights by banning the sale of antique firearms that contain endangered elephant ivory.
The National Rifle Association (NRA) announced Friday it is joining the fight to roll back the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's controversial ivory ban, just months after musicians began complaining about the policy.

The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) says the rule is intended to protect endangered African elephants, but Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA's lobbying arm, says it would be “disastrous” for gun collectors.
“While the goal of restricting illegal commerce in endangered species is laudable, the effects of the ivory ban would be disastrous for American firearms owners and sportsmen, as well as anyone else who currently owns ivory,” said Cox, who backed Republican efforts to reverse the ivory ban through legislation.
While modern guns do not contain ivory, the grips on many antique guns do, as it was considered fashionable in the 1800s and early 1900s. Gun rights groups say the rule could freeze up the market for collectors of antique firearms.
The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) issued the ivory ban earlier this year in an effort to crack down on illegal animal tracking. The FWS reasoned that closing the market for elephant ivory would remove the financial incentive for poachers.
But critics say the rule unfairly limits the sale of antique items, such as guns and musical instruments, that were made with ivory long before elephant poaching was outlawed in 1976. They argue that trading the antiques does not contribute to the slaughter of elephants and should be permitted.
“The irony is that the proposed ban would do virtually nothing to protect elephants, but could instead make law-abiding Americans potential criminals overnight,” Cox said.
Congress is getting involved in the issue.
The NRA has found support from Republicans who are pushing bills in the House and Senate that would roll back the ivory ban. On Thursday, Reps. Steve Daines (Mont.) and Jeff Miller (Fla.) introduced the Lawful Ivory Protection Act in the House, and Sen. Lamar Alexander Andrew (Lamar) Lamar AlexanderPence meeting with Senate GOP ahead of vote to block emergency declaration Addressing repair backlog at national parks can give Congress a big win The Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump MORE (R-Tenn.) followed suit in the upper chamber.
The bills would reverse the ivory rule and allow gun owners to sell antique firearms that contain ivory from before the 1976 ban. But it would not allow gun manufacturers to make firearms with newly acquired ivory.
Musicians have already won a partial exemption from the ivory ban that allows them to travel with their instruments overseas. Many older stringed instruments, such as cellos and violins, contain ivory, but musicians had been unable to perform in foreign orchestras because the rule would have allowed customs officials to confiscate their instruments when they returned to the U.S.
The FWS granted the musicians a travel exemption, but they are still barred from selling antiques that contain ivory — and the same limitation applies for gun collectors.
Some say the ivory ban could have bigger implications for gun owners than just limiting collectors.
Larry Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of American, a gun rights lobbying group, said the ban “infringes” on people's right to bear arms.
“It's clearly an infringement on the Second Amendment,” Pratt said. “When you restrict the trade of firearms, that's right in the middle of ‘shall not be infringed.' ”
While the ban's impact on gun owners may be small, because it only deals with antique guns and not modern guns, Rep. Miller suggested it is no less significant.
“I will grant you that a very small portion of firearms have ivory inlays or grips on them,” Miller said. “However, if you are a collector of antique Colt pistols (or other old guns), this could seriously impact your Second Amendment rights.”
David Boone owns a gun shop in Washington state that takes elephant ivory which was obtained legally and fashions it into pistol grips. They project the ivory ban would take away 80 percent of their sales.
“It would be the end of our business as we know it,” said Boone, who is a distant relative of the famous frontiersman Daniel Boone.
Pratt is concerned the Obama administration may be using the ivory ban as a backhanded way of pushing a gun control agenda.
“If they're able to get away with this step, they will take others,” Pratt said. “They will just start restricting the trade of firearms more generally. They've been here and there making their moves.”
To lead a helping hand in improving quality care and reducing waste, several healthcare practices and hospitals now make use of Six Sigma tools. They do so to achieve the highest level of efficiency in patient care. When Six Sigma is used in healthcare, it has the power to eliminate any and every variation and defects in processes. It also has the ability to streamline all procedures by making them efficient and less costly. This paves the way for improved care of the patients.
In any hospital or healthcare practice, a defect is something that always leads to the dissatisfaction of patients. Such defects may include:
A long waiting time to consult a doctor
Incorrect diagnosis of an ailment
Incorrect treatment of the same
All these defects are frustrating as well as quite serious, hence must be removed as soon as possible to make life easier for the patients.
How Six Sigma makes healthcare better
The possibility of variance is much higher in the patient care industry than in any other process, because it is a hands-on process. The variables are quite small in size, hence, cannot be quantified properly. But with the data driven approach of Six Sigma, the improvements can actually be measured by analytics and business experts. The entire process takes a total of 5 steps to improve the quality of patient care with Six Sigma.
They are as follows:
Define – The process needs to properly define the identity of the patients and their exact requirements. The capabilities of the process which an analyst is measuring also need to be defined. Last but not the least, the objectives of the process also need a proper and clear definition.
Measure – The improvements that healthcares practice goes through need to be measurable. The data, based on which, the measurements will be made need to be clear and accurate. The metrics that are used to measure and define the performance of a hospital are service cost, service level, clinical excellence, patient satisfaction, etc.
Analyze – Proper and accurate data needs to be collected and analyzed with the best possible Six Sigma tools for better efficiency.
Improve – Several modifications and changes need to be implemented to bring about improvements in the entire patient care approach using Six Sigma.
Control – All performances need to be and must be monitored to maintain a steady level of improvement and growth in every aspect of patient care.
Lean Six Sigma performs the following functions to improve the healthcare business and the patient care approach:
It reduces the errors caused by technicians, nurses and doctors
It improves the turnaround time of diagnostic labs and departments
It decreases the number of steps used in the supply chain for quick service
It reduces the waiting time of doctors' appointments
It makes insurance claim reimbursements much faster
It generally improves patient satisfaction levels
With the use of Six Sigma, it becomes a whole lot easier for patients to access information on Healthcare providers in a much easier way. The higher the quality of patient care, the more will a healthcare provider be chosen. Six Sigma plays an important role in that. Patient reviews make or break the fortunes of any hospital or healthcare organization. It is an essential factor for other patients to go for a particular hospital as well. So these organizations need to take care as to how they are using the Six Sigma protocols for the betterment of patient satisfaction levels. So if you are a hospital manager or owner, you need to brush up on your Six Sigma skills to do the needful and improve your game.

Penrith has lost talented utility player Sitaleki Akauola to English club Warrington.
Kiwi born Akauola - a back-rower or prop - has signed a two year deal with the Wolves from next season.
The 25-year old Wests Tigers junior played 11 games for the joint venture in 2013-14 before joining the Panthers at the start of last season.
Akauola was a key member of the Panthers team that stunned the league by finishing in sixth spot on the ladder, playing 14 games.
This season they have struggled to hold a regular place in the top side but has still managed seven matches for coach Anthony Griffin.
Big and strong, Akauola is versatile - they have filled in on the wing on occasion in the NRL and not looked out of place.
Warrington had a disappointing 2016 and have been chasing several Aussie stars including Cooper Cronk (Storm) and Tyrone Roberts (Titans).
France is under renewed pressure to cut its budget deficit, after the European Commission forecast it would miss its 2015 reduction target.
France's budget deficit is expected to stand at 3.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014 and 3.4 percent in 2015, above the European Union (EU)'s 3 percent target.
The EU has been lenient with France and extended its deadline to hit the deficit target two years to 2015. But France will face fines if it doesn't meet the requirement by 2015, under recent powers granted to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.
Last month, President Francois Hollande's newly reshuffled cabinet announced a package of reforms that aims to make 50 billion euros ($69 billion) worth of savings and will be rolled out over the next 3 years. The French government is adamant the cuts will allow the country to hit the 3 percent target and keep France competitive, when coupled with its pro-business reform package known as the "responsibility and solidarity pact".
Read More Hollande confirms Valls as PM, stands by pro-business pact
"The Government reaffirms its determination to implement the Responsibility and Solidarity Pact and to realise the 50 billion euros of necessary economic efforts to bring the deficit down to 3 percent of GDP in 2015 and the progression of public spending in line with inflation," the office of France's finance minister, Michel Sapin, said in a statement.
The Commission's forecast on Monday did not take into account all of the savings proposed by the French government, which could go some way to explaining the Commission's pessimism relative to France's.
"The Commission does not take into account measures which have not been voted through yet or haven't been sufficiently precise," Philippe Gudin, chief European economist at Barclays, told CNBC in a phone interview. "What is important to see is whether there are enough measures in the deficit reduction program and whether the Commission needs more clarification about the measures to see the deficit decrease."
The Commission was positive on some aspects of France's recovery. Firms could see profit margins increase, with cuts to employer social security contributions. Employment could tick up gradually as some of the measures aimed at reducing labor costs take hold, although this is likely to be a modest gain.
After being relatively flat in 2013, France's economy is set to see 1.0 percent growth this year and 1.5 percent in 2015. This is however still below the euro zone average, so France is not out of the woods, according to analysts.
Read More Euro zone deflation risks low: European Commission
"The whole reading for France is not great, there is a lack of coherence in France's reform approach," Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at Open Europe, told CNBC. "They are being forced to do reforms in deficit-cutting from the EU, but they haven't embraced that fully. The reforms seem tentative."

Election 2016: Labor's Anne Aly claims victory in Cowan after vote count correction
Updated
Labor's Anne Aly has claimed victory in the Perth-based seat of Cowan, becoming the first Muslim woman elected to the House of Representatives.
Dr Aly, an anti-terrorism and de-radicalisation expert, also believed the Liberal campaign to paint them as soft on terrorism backfired and did not lose them any votes.
Incumbent Liberal MP Luke Simpkins has not conceded defeat, with the Liberal Party stating several thousand votes remained to be counted and it would wait to see how they fell.
But WA Labor says it has won the marginal West Australian seat.
The declaration came after the Australian Electoral Commission confirmed it had mistakenly placed about 200 Greens votes in Mr Simpkins' pile in the northern booth of Tapping.
After preferences were allocated, Dr Aly received 160 of the votes pushing their lead against Mr Simpkins out to 787.
Labor calculated there was no way they could now close the gap, even though almost 10,000 mostly absentee votes remain to be tallied.
'Diverse parliament in trying times a positive'
Dr Aly said they were humbled and looked forward to becoming a strong and fair voice in parliament for the Cowan community.
They said they recognised the significance of becoming the first Muslim woman in the Lower House of federal parliament.
"I think having a diverse parliament in these very trying times is an absolute positive and bodes well for the future of Australia," Dr Aly told reporters.
During the campaign, Liberal frontbenchers criticised Dr Aly's judgement, claiming they had provided support to radical Islamic preacher Junaid Thorne during their trial for flying with a false identity.
They countered it was a smear campaign and the de-radicalisation program they had suggested for Thorne was funded by the Coalition government.
Dr Aly said they did not think the criticism had played a huge role in the Cowan result.
"I do believe it backfired, whether or not it actually helped, I think that's a long short to call, that's a difficult call to make," they said.
"But I do believe it did backfire. But it certainly didn't lose me any votes."
Mr Simpkins, who has held the seat since 2007, declined to comment.

Obviously I'd normally ask developer questions on Stack Overflow but in this case, it feels like the answers may be at least somewhat opinion-based. If it turns out that it's sufficiently straightforward that a Stack Overflow question and answer would be useful, I can always repost it there later.
The Facts
Noda Time 1.x exists “in production”, and the latest version is 1.3.1. This targets .NET 3.5 Client profile, .NET 4.0, and PCL Profile 328 (in a directory of lib\portable-net4+sl5+netcore45+wpa81+wp8+MonoAndroid1+MonoTouch1+XamariniOS1 )
Noda Time currently includes the IANA time zone data (“TZDB”) – each released version of Noda Time contains the TZDB version that was “most recent” at the time that the Noda Time release was built. This gets out of date quite quickly, as there are multiple releases of TZDB every year. Those releases are named 2016a, 2016b etc. Noda Time also provides the ability to read .nzd files (Noda Zone Data – a custom format) and every time there's a new release of TZDB, I build a .nzd file and upload it to nodatime.org , updating http://nodatime.org/tzdb/latest.txt to point to the latest version.
Noda Time 2.0 has not been released yet. When I do release it, I expect to target .NET 4.5 and netstandard1.0.
Each Noda Time 1.x release has an AssemblyVersion just based on major/minor, i.e. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 etc. Based on this blog post, this may have been a mistake – it should quite possibly have been 1.0 for all versions. Obviously I can't fix that now, but I can make the 2.x releases use 2.0 everywhere.
When 2.0 is “pretty much ready” we're going to cut a 1.4 release which deprecates things that are removed in 2.0 and provides the new approaches as far as possible. For example, the IClock.Now property from 1.x is removed in 2.0, and replaced by IClock.GetCurrentInstant() . We'll deprecate the Now property and introduce a GetCurrentInstant() extension method which delegates to it. This shouldn't break any 1.x users, but should allow them to move over to the new API as far as possible before upgrading to 2.0. The intention is that users wouldn't stay on 1.4 for very long. (Obviously they could do so, but there's not a lot of benefit. 1.4 won't have new features – it's really just a transition version.)
So far, that's just the way of the world. Now I want to make it easier for users to stay up-to-date with TZDB – including if nodatime.org goes down. (That's considerably more likely than nuget.org going down, for example.)
The plan is to introduce a new nearly-data-only assembly, packaged as NodaTime.Tzdb . The aim is to allow users to update their data dependency at build time, in a controlled fashion. If you only want to specify an exact version to depend on, you can do so. If you want to pick up the latest version every time you build, that should be possible too.
The tricky bits come in terms of the versioning.
Some options
Firstly, the versioning scheme for the package ignoring everything else. I plan to use something like this:
2016a => 1.2016.1
2016b => 1.2016.2
2016c => 1.2016.3
…
2017a => 1.2017.1
This should make it reasonably easy to tell the TZDB version just from the package version.
However, I'm considering a few options within this idea:
I could create a single package per TZDB release, targeting .NET 3.5 client profile, .NET 4.0, the Profile 328 PCL, .NET 4.5, and .NET Standard 1.0. The first four of these could depend on Noda Time 1.1, and the last one would have to depend on Noda Time 2.0.
I could do the above, but depend on 1.3.1 instead of 1.1.
I could create one package with two versions per TZDB release – a 1.x depending on Noda Time 1.1, and a 2.x depending on Noda Time 2.0. For example, when TZDB 2016d is released, I could create 1.2016.4 and 2.2016.4.
I could create one package version depending on 1.1, one depending on 1.2, one depending on 1.3, one depending on 1.4 (when that exists) and one depending on 2.0.
I could create two separate packages, i.e. include the Noda Time major version number in the package name. I don't like this idea, but it's on the table.
Some concerns and questions
There are various aspects to this which cause me a few worries. I'm not sure how well I can really structure or segregate those, so I'll just list them.
Can a non-prerelease package depend on a prerelease package for some frameworks? If not, that possibly blows the “single version” idea out of the water, as I can't depend on NodaTime v2.0 yet – it's not out.
Even if that's feasible, is it sane to depend on different major versions of the NodaTime package from within a single version of the NodaTime.Tzdb package, or is that going to cause massive confusion?
Should I depend on NodaTime v1.1 or v1.3.1? They have different AssemblyVersion numbers, which I believe means an assembly binding redirect will be required if I depend on 1.1 but users depend on 1.3.1. To be clear, I don't expect many users to still be on versions older than 1.3.1.
numbers, which I believe means an assembly binding redirect will be required if I depend on 1.1 but users depend on 1.3.1. To be clear, I don't expect many users to still be on versions older than 1.3.1. Likewise, is it going to cause issues for .NET 4.5 users who use NodaTime 2.0 (eventually) if they depend on a version of NodaTime.Tzdb that depends on NodaTime 1.3.1? Again, presumably assembly binding redirects are needed.
If I go with the “two-version” scheme (i.e. 1.2016.4 and 2.2016.4 etc) how careful would NodaTime 1.3.1 users have to be? I wouldn't want them to accidentally get upgraded to NodaTime 2.0 when that's released, by accidentally taking the 2.x line of NodaTime.Tzdb.
Does dotnet cli support the nuget allowedVersions feature at all? I haven't found any support for it in DNX, but really it's vital for this scheme to work at all – basically I'd expect a NodaTime 1.3.1 user to specify an allowed version range for NodaTime.Tzdb of [1,2)
feature at all? I haven't found any support for it in DNX, but really it's vital for this scheme to work at all – basically I'd expect a NodaTime 1.3.1 user to specify an allowed version range for NodaTime.Tzdb of Is my scheme of 1.2016.4 (etc) sensible? It's somewhat abusing major/minor/patch, in that there's no real difference in meaning between a minor version bump (“it's the new year”) and a patch bump (“there's been another release in the same year”). Neither kind of change will be breaking (unless you depend on specific time zones behaving in specific ways, of course), and it's handy to be able to give a simple mapping between TZDB version and package version, but there may be consequences I'm unaware of.
Please feel free to ask clarifying questions in comments. Will look forward to getting some answers :)
We've been complaining about the lack of Team Fortress 2 collectibles for months now. We even did it yesterday. That complaining stops today, however, with the reveal of a gorgeous statue based on the game's "Heavy".
It'll stand a whopping 12 inches tall, and come in both red and blue flavours (with exclusive variants with different facial expressions), so as not to have anyone feeling left out.
Best part? It's just the first in an entire line of them, so hopefully we'll see each and every member of the Team Fortress 2 team represented.
Actually, no. That's not the best part. The best part is that Gaming Heads, the studio responsible for the statues, is also releasing a line of statues based on Half-Life 2 and Left 4 Dead, as well as "life size props". The presence of a Portal logo on the company's website has us thinking "life size portal gun".

Description
*** Wow, this build made it into the Minecraft Schematic's newsletter ***
A cavern scene modelled slightly on Moria from Lord of the Rings, although in the end it looked very different. Never got round to finishing the whole build, but i thought I'd upload it anyway. Created it on my own using DukuCraft texture pack light, I recommend using this texture pack to view it as it looks completely different otherwise. There are also tonnes of caves in the map so It's great to explore. Feel free to use in anyway you want so long as you acknowledge me and provide a link to here if you can :)

Both Panasonic and Canon announced their first water- and shock-proof compact toughcams earlier this year, and we've taken them underwater for a test. Which is better for capturing your summertime antics both wet AND wild?
Advertisement
Let me say first that I did not use either of these cameras in their ideal conditions—namely, outside, underwater while swimming. For some reason, Canon and Panasonic did not tailor the release dates of these cameras to coincide with my trip to Egypt a few months ago, which is where I wanted to test them out (why not guys??). Back here in New York, any outdoor body of water is way too frigid right now, and there's something pretty creepy and ultimately unacceptable about taking an underwater camera to the YMCA for test shots. So, instead of the verdant coral reefs of the Red Sea off the Sinai coast, which were straight out of Planet Earth, our test shots are of me playing with a Kraken Attackin' Lego Pirates playset in my kitchen sink. Which is a cool playset, but, you know, not the same.

But still, we've gathered enough data I think to inform your decision, if you're thinking of picking up a waterproof toughcam for this summer. Here are the main points of differentiation I see:
Form Factor/Interface
Both cameras are waterproof, but the Canon D10 is protected up to 10 meters (around 32 feet), where the Panasonic TS1 is only protected up to three meters (around 10 feet). And that's immediately apparent in their shapes:
The D10 looks like it was designed by Ringo on the set of Yellow Submarine—its bulbous shell and porthole-like screws drive home the fact that this baby is going underwater. But on land, it'll be tough to fit it into a pants pocket without some serious bulging.
Advertisement
It does have some nice, easy-to-press buttons for changing into video mode, for instance, and the icons on the LCD screen are nice and big, easily spotted through a snorkeling mask. There are some superfluous button presses to lock in settings which could be tedious underwater, but the UI is not horrible, and you'll easily get used to it. The D10 also has come big screw-mounts on each corner for mounting various underwater grips and other accessories that you can buy from Canon.
The TS1 takes a totally different approach, with a sleek rectangular slab shape that at first glance is hard to distinguish from regular non-tough weeniecams. The buttons are a bit smaller, but not prohibitively so, and shootings modes are selected with a thumb dial instead of dedicated buttons—I didn't see anything I couldn't operate with a bit of practice while snorkeling. A basic locking wrist-strap comes in the box.
The important thing is that the TS1 is not at all out of place in non-toughcam situations, where the D10 may be. But if you're a deep snorkeler, three meters may not be enough for you compared to the D10's 10 meters (I imagine if you're a serious SCUBA diver, you'll need something beefier than either of these), but where you lose usability underwater with the TS1 you will gain it on land. Consider that.

Video
Another big difference, if not the biggest, is that the Panasonic TS1 shoots 720p in the AVCHD format, where the Canon only does 640x480 VGA vids. The TS1 video recording mode isn't the most polished—there's a good two to three-second delay from when you hit the dedicated video button to when recording actually starts and stops, and it's unclear exactly when everything does start, but if you're OK with that, the HD video mode is awesome. I mean, underwater HD in such a tiny package—that's a no-brainer right? I would kill to have some HD clips of my friends and I are swimming around in crazy schools of neon fish in Egypt.
Here are some sample clips from the sink:
TS1 720P Clip:

Note: There is a current bug with the TS1 that makes video imported into iMovie '08 and '09 play at double speed. I had to do some conversion to avoid this, which is a pain. Panasonic says they're working with Apple on this to include a fix in future versions of iMovie.
Canon D10 VGA Clip:
Keep in mind that the AVCHD format is kind of annoying, in that you might have to install special codecs and import video straight into your video editing software of choice and then export it in friendlier formats, rather than just grabbing an AVI or MOV clip from the memory card and uploading it to YouTube.
Advertisement
And yeah, the quality of these videos is pretty bad, but the difference in the actual output is clear: 720p underwater rules.
Shooting
Both cameras are 12-megapixels, for full-res shots at 4000x3000. Both have the same size CCD sensor, but the TS1's ISO goes up to 6400 where the Canon D10's only to 1600. I didn't do a thorough sensitivity test with either camera, but I would imagine you don't want to go much higher than 800 on either one, so the difference is probably fairly moot.
A difference that does matter is the TS1's wider-angle lens: it's a 28mm-128mm f/3.3-f/5.9 effective focal length zoom, compared to the D10's 35mm-105mm f/2.8-f/4.9.

As you can see, color reproduction via the TS1's Leica lens is far better than the D10s, which has to fight through a bit more protective plastic. Also, the TS1 tends to autofocus underwater with much greater ease—important, because you won't always be able to look at the LCD when composing shots while snorkeling.
Conclusion
Like I said, I only played with these cameras in the sink, so I didn't push their waterproof capabilities to their max. But having a waterproof and shockproof camera around the house is kind of cool in its own right—imagine taking bath time photos of your kid without having to worry about getting the camera wet, or taking shots with dirty hands while you're barbecuing, or anything like that. You can always dunk these cameras underwater to clean them off. It's nice. You don't have to be a snorkeler to use them and have fun with them.
Which is why for me, the balance shifts heavily toward the Panasonic TS1. Its form factor makes using it on land a lot more convenient, and the added HD video option is a huge plus. And my ears hurt if I go down much further than three meters underwater anyway. At a premium of only $70 ($400 list vs. $330 for the D10), I'd say it's well worth spending up for.

For at least the past decade, satellites have spotted white dots cropping up in the North Sea. If viewed from Earth's surface, you would see that these dots are actually wind turbines—huge arrays of towers rising from the sea and topped with electricity-generating rotors. But they're doing more than harvesting the wind. They appear to also be giving rise to sediment plumes.
Some of the North Sea's most expansive arrays are visible in these images, acquired on Jun 30, 2015, with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on the Landsat 8 satellite. When these images were acquired, there were 84 offshore wind farms in Europe (including some under construction). The North Sea accounts for the most offshore wind capacity—69 percent—in European seas, followed by the Irish Sea and Baltic Sea.
The turbines were built to take advantage of high winds blowing over the North Sea's surface. The London Array, visible in the first detailed image, spans 100 square kilometers (40 square miles). The wind farm, which first became operational in 2013, sits on two natural sandbanks in water as deep as 25 meters (80 feet). The site was chosen because of its proximity to onshore electric power infrastructure and because it is beyond the main shipping lanes through the area.
Other significant wind farms, Thanet and the northern half of Greater Gabbard, are shown in the second and third detailed images. Thanet spans 35 square kilometers (14 square miles) and sits in water measuring 20 to 25 meters deep; the entirety of Greater Gabbard spans 147 square kilometers (57 square miles) and sits in water 24 to 34 meters deep.
But the environment below the water's surface can also feel the presence of the turbines. The detailed views reveal light-brown plumes of suspended sediments extending from each tower. In a 2014 paper, researchers analyzed satellite imagery and found that the wakes (and plumes) can measure anywhere from 30 to 150 meters wide and up to several kilometers long.
“The fact that the wakes are browner than the surrounding waters shows that they contain more suspended sediments,” said Quinten Vanhellemont, a researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and lead author of the 2014 paper. “This shows that the installation of the wind turbines not only modifies the wind field above the sea surface (which is expected as they are extracting wind energy), but that they also modify the currents and sediment transport in the water.”
Vanhellemont explained that the wakes are generated by the tidal current moving around the foundation of the turbine. The direction and curvature in the wakes are related to the general direction of the current. For example, the image of the London Array was acquired during flood tide, so the wakes follow the northward current. But the tide in this area reverses every six hours, Vanhellemont said, “so the wakes are quite dynamic over the day.”
It's not yet clear how these changes in sediment transport could affect the relatively shallow underwater environment, which is known to be an important fish nursery. According to Vanhellemont, researchers at the University of Hull are currently studying the wakes in greater detail by investigating their 3D structure.

The term monorail or industrial monorail is used to describe any number of transport systems in which a chair or carrier is suspended from, or rides on, an overhead rail structure. Unlike the well-known duo-rail system, there are many rail-guided transport options which have been described as monorails, so that tracing the history presents a demarcation problem regarding what should be included and what should be omitted.
Common usage appears to define a monorail as any rail guided vehicle which does not employ the coning action of conventional adhesion railways to achieve directional stability. This would exclude rack railways and funicular railways.
Bearing in mind the pattern of development of conventional railways, different criteria and measures of effectiveness were relevant at different times, and alternative design solutions were proposed. Hence, a monorail of the early 19th Century bears little resemblance to current designs, and were optimised for different performance objectives, within different technological constraints.
Early developments [ edit ]
The Lartigue monorail
The earliest patent for a vehicle designed to run on a single rail can be traced to UK patent No 4618 dated 22 November 1821. The inventor was Henry Robinson Palmer, commonly known by their alias as "George Monorail", who described it as 'a single line of rail, supported at such height from the ground as to allow the centre of gravity of the carriages to be below the upper surface of the rail'. The vehicles straddled the rail, rather like a pair of pannier baskets on a mule. Propulsion was by horse.[1] A line was built in 1824 in the Deptford Dockyard in London, and in 1825, another line was built in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. Dubbed the Cheshunt Railway, this line made history as it was the world's first passenger-carrying monorail, and the first railway line to open in Hertfordshire.[2][3] In 1826 a company was formed to construct a line between Barmen and Elberfeld in Germany, but construction never started.
Throughout the 19th Century, the Palmer design was improved, with the addition of stabilising wheels and additional rails (rendering a misnomer of 'monorail'). In 1829, Maxwell Dick introduced 'safety rails' below the running rails to reduce the likelihood of derailment. They also articulated the main advantage claimed for this class of vehicle: 'the pillars or supports to be of different heights as circumstances of the country may require'. In other words, the system was better suited for crossing rough terrain.
In 1868, William Thorold M.I.C.E. presented a paper proposing a monorail system that could be built at ground level in or alongside roads. The Patiala State Monorail Trainways and Kundala Valley Railway were built in India on the principle that they described.
In 1869, J Haddon built a monorail in Syria to replace a mule train in military use. This embodied lateral guide rails, but was basically a pannier design hauled by a locomotive having double vertical steam boilers.
General LeRoy Stone demonstrated in 1876 their Centennial Monorail for transporting passengers, but failed to exploit the concept also on the Bradford and Foster Brook Monorail, and this was closed after only one year due to a lethal boiler explosion in 1879. Around 1879, Joseph Stringfellow devised a similar "one-rail" system for possible use as a "cheap railway" in Australia.[4]
By the end of the 19th Century, the main protagonists for the monorail where Charles Lartigue and F. B. Behr. Lartigue constructed Palmer monorails in Algeria to transport esparto grass, to replace mules and camels, although the motive power is recorded as 'animal'. They also demonstrated their ideas in Paris (1884), Westminster (1886), Tours (1889), St Petersburg (1894), Long Island (1894) and Brussels (1897). Behr proposed a high speed monorail between Liverpool and Manchester, but construction never started through lack of financial support.
The most famous Lartigue monorail was the Listowel and Ballybunion Railway, in Ireland, which stayed in service from 1888 until 1924.[5] Part of this railway survives as a preserved railway and tourist attraction.[6][7]
The last Lartigue design was built in 1924 between a magnesium mine at Crystal Hills, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, and a railhead in Trona, California. This used petrol driven locomotives, and mounted the rail on a set of wooden A frame.
Suspended and bicycle railways [ edit ]
In 1886, the Enos Electric Company demonstrated a suspended monorail on the grounds of the Daft Electric Light Company in the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey,[8] which was closer in its appearance to more modern monorails, but the most famous suspended monorail of this era was Eugen Langen's 'Schwebebahn', or floating railway, of Wuppertal, which entered service in 1901, and is still in daily use.
The Wuppertal monorail follows the Wupper Valley where a conventional railway is quite impractical. The suspended monorail, like the Palmer monorail appears a potentially superior solution over rough and mountainous terrain, but since the majority of the track is over more favourable territory, it only rarely offers an overall better solution. Short sections in mountainous areas, such as a system built for the Ria Copper Co. by Siemens in the Pyrenees, seem to be the niche for this type of monorail. This particular example used a form of regenerative braking, such that the electricity generated by the full descending trucks was sufficient to drive the empty trucks back up the mountain.
In 1890 the Boynton Bicycle Railroad was built in Long Island.[9][10] Designed by Jose Ramon Villalon, who would later become one of Cuba's greatest statesmen, this railroad ran on a single rail at ground level, but with an overhead stabilising rail engaged by a pair of horizontally opposed wheels. The railway operated for only two years, but the design was adopted elsewhere.
In 1908, Elfric Wells Chalmers Kearney (1881–1960)[11] designed a monorail having an overhead stabilizing rail with spring-loaded vertical stabilizing wheels, but although a car was built, it never saw service.
From 1910–1914 a monorail system designed by Howard H Tunis was used on the Pelham Park and City Island Railroad in the Bronx, New York City. On the first trip of the monorail, the vehicle, with the inventor at the controls, slipped off the supporting lower rail. Though some of the New York newspapers erroneously reported that the accident was a major catastrophe, that is not so, and only one passenger on the car claimed a minor injury. The car was quickly repaired and the monorail operated safely on a regular basis from 1911 until 1917, when it was dismantled by the military at the outset of World War I, because the terminal near City Island was requisitioned. A propeller-driven suspended monorail, claiming the speed of aircraft with the safety and reliability of railways was designed by George Bennie in 1926, and named the 'Bennie Railplane'. A demonstrator was built near Glasgow in 1929, but the system did not progress further in the UK.
Russia worked on a system similar to the Bennie Railplane in the 1930s and were even planning a 332-mile line through Turkestan with a top speed of 180 mph. Their system was unique in that it had two side by side cars suspended on one rail, and it could actually dismount from the rail to cross rivers as an amphibian and then on the other side remount the rail. And while elements of this system were tested in Moscow, the Russian government instead built a conventional rail system.[12]
The gyro monorail [ edit ]
Brennan's Monorail
Perhaps the only true monorail was the Gyro Monorail developed independently by Louis Brennan, August Scherl and Pyotr Shilovsky. This was a true single track train which used a gyroscope-based balancing system to remain upright. All were demonstrated by full-scale prototypes, but development was effectively stopped by the First World War. Brennan's design was given serious consideration for the North-West Frontier of India, and a Schilovski monorail was proposed by the USSR government between Leningrad and Tsarskoye Selo in 1921.[13] Funds ran out shortly after construction began.
In the early 1930s, New York city considered a monorail system, which would have been the first in the US.[14]
Evolution of 'wheel on steel' monorail [ edit ]
The vehicles referenced above (with the exception of the still in full service Wuppertal monorail) are now little more than historical curiosities. The advantage of the monorail of crossing rough mountainous terrain was relevant to the time of expansion of railway networks over virgin country, and in most cases the conventional railway proved the more appropriate solution, except for a few niches. Monorail tracks were rarely longer than 60 miles, and usually considerably shorter. The motor road vehicle finally displaced the monorail from its few niche applications.
Wheel on steel characterised monorails of this early era, just as it does conventional railways, although some bicycle railways could react against the stabilizing rail to increase adhesion, improving acceleration, braking and hill climbing.
The modern era: straddling beams [ edit ]
The development of automotive technology has given rise to a new class of monorail which owes little to the work of Palmer and Lartigue. These vehicles are suspended from or straddle concrete beams, and use pneumatic tyres to improve adhesion and reduce noise compared with wheel on steel. They have more in common with guided buses than conventional railways. The beam is less obtrusive than an overhead roadway or railway, and the modern designs may have a niche in dealing with right of way problems in congested city centres, at lower cost compared with tunneling.

African-Americans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election, creating a vexing problem for Hillary Clinton as they cling to a deteriorating lead over Donald Trump with Election Day just a week away.
As tens of millions of Americans cast ballots in what will be the largest-ever mobilization of early voters in a presidential election, the numbers have started to point toward a slump that many Democrats feared might materialize without the nation's first black president on the ticket.
The reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical, with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play. In North Carolina, where a federal appeals court accused Republicans of an “almost surgical” assault on black turnout and Republican-run election boards curtailed early-voting sites, black turnout is down 16 percent. White turnout, however, is up 15 percent. Democrats are planning an aggressive final push, including a visit by President Barack Obama to the state Wednesday.

But in Florida, which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in 2012, African-Americans' share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased, to 15 percent today from 25 percent four years ago.
The problems for Democrats do not end there. In Ohio, which also cut back its early voting, voter participation in the heavily Democratic areas near Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo has been down, although the Clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day Sunday when African-American churches led voter drives across the state.

The black turnout so far could foreshadow a larger and more intractable problem for Clinton and the Democratic Party as they rethink their place in a post-Obama era. One of the biggest uncertainties that Democrats have been forced to confront in this election is whether Obama's absence from the ticket would depress black enthusiasm, which was at historic levels in 2008 and 2012 and would have been difficult to replicate under even the best of circumstances.
The Clinton campaign believes it can close the gap, especially in North Carolina and Florida, by Election Day. And Democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like Hispanics and college-educated women, which have the potential to more than make up for any drop-off in black voting.

But this election could determine if the Obama-era level of participation among blacks is sustainable. It could also show that the Democratic Party, which has benefited enormously from population shifts that have left the country more diverse, is facing a demographic reckoning of its own.
“We've had back-to-back elections in this country of high turnout where black voters have set the pace, and it's going to be really interesting to see if that continues post-Obama,” said Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster and the author of “A Black Man in the White House,” which draws on their research of voters over the past eight years to examine the Obama phenomenon and the resulting backlash.
“That is the big X-factor,” Belcher added. “Can we disconnect our mobilization, our messaging from the cult of the candidate?”
Working in Clinton's favor even if their share of the black vote declines is the fact that they have built a political coalition different from Obama's.  They are counting on an electorate that is more Hispanic and includes more white voters — especially college-educated women — who would have considered voting Republican but are repelled by Trump.
Marc Farinella, who ran Obama's North Carolina campaign in 2008, said it was obvious the level of energy had fallen among African-Americans. But, they added, “I'm not entirely sure it's completely necessary for her.”
“She's got other dynamics and advantages that Obama didn't have,” they said.
In few places are the disadvantages that Democrats face more pronounced than in North Carolina. Although a federal court curtailed the Republican-backed law that reduced the number of days of early voting, localities were left to decide how many polling places they would open.

In Guilford County, about an hour's drive west from the state capital, the population is roughly one-third black. For the first week of in-person early voting there, voters could go to only one place to cast a ballot, the Guilford County Courthouse in the county seat, Greensboro. In 2012, there were 16 locations.
The banner headline on the local newspaper, The News & Record, captured the funk: “Ballot Box Blahs,” it said Tuesday. A total of 88,383 ballots were cast in the first 12 days of early voting this year, down from 100,761 in the first 12 days of 2012.
The black vote was also lagging, at 34 percent of the turnout this year, compared with 40 percent in 2012.
Some black voters, like Ronald Brooks, said they simply needed more time to make a decision this year. It was just easier, Brooks said, in 2008 and 2012, when they had voted for Obama.
Brooks, 31, a mental health worker, was still weighing their options Tuesday morning. They said they were worried about Clinton's trustworthiness, given that they had set up a private email server as secretary of state.
“What were you trying to hide?” they said.
Their hesitation reflected a generational divide among African-Americans: Older voters have an affection for Clinton and their husband, and a fear of Trump, that many younger voters do not share.
Democrats in North Carolina have been fighting other efforts they believe are intended disenfranchise blacks. A federal district judge scheduled a hearing for Wednesday morning in a suit by the state NAACP alleging that at least three North Carolina counties, prompted by Republican challenges, have illegally struck 4,500 residents from voter rolls.
The state NAACP. president, the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, said the purges were little more than election trickery aimed at disenfranchising legally registered voters.
“It's sickening and disgusting, what is going on,” they said at a news briefing Tuesday.
Michael Bitzer, a professor of political science at Catawba College, said the racial composition of the early-voting electorate in the state so far is off from 2012. White voters make up 72 percent of those who have cast ballots; black voters are 22 percent. In 2012, early voters were 67 percent white and 27 percent black.
Inside the Clinton campaign, crunchtime has begun. Addisu Demissie, the campaign's national voter outreach and mobilization director, said in an interview Tuesday that they felt good about where North Carolina stood, given how the election rules had changed. There and in other states like Florida and Ohio, they added, the campaign believes it is in a strong position to leverage its organizational advantage over Trump.
“We need to continue to work,” Demissie said. “We know that most people are driven by deadlines,” they added, “and we will see, as we have seen in this campaign at every point, a ramp-up in activity and in engagement from us as the deadline approaches.”
Florida has emerged as another potential soft spot of black support, despite efforts by the state to make it easier for more people to vote early. It added five more days of early voting, plus a sixth on the final Sunday before the election in many of the largest urban areas like Miami.
Yet African-Americans are underperforming their participation rates from 2012. Daniel A. Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Florida, compared the early voting so far in minority-heavy Miami-Dade, Palm Beach and Broward counties with that in 2012. They found that of those who have cast ballots this year, 22 percent were black, 40 percent were white and 31 percent were Hispanic. In 2012, the breakdown was 36 percent black, 35 percent white and 23 percent Hispanic.
“If the Clinton campaign doesn't ramp it up,” Smith said, “Florida will be in doubt.”
Still, Clinton maintains a huge organizational advantage, not to mention a likely lead among the people who are now voting in the Western battlegrounds of Colorado and Nevada, where Democrats have cast more ballots. And in a sign of how narrow Trump's path is, Clinton could lose Florida, North Carolina and Ohio and still beat him.
Antonio Calanni / AP The first clone produced from the gelded endurance champion Pieraz, cavorts in a field near Cremona, Italy, in 2005.
A federal judge in Texas on Monday ordered the American Quarter Horse Association to allow cloned horses and their offspring to be entered into the breed's official registry, a decision that could soon clear the way for the genetically engineered animals to compete at scores of racetracks in the U.S. and elsewhere.
“We're excited. It's been a tough battle,” said rancher Jason Abraham of Canadian, Texas, one of two plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleging that the AQHA had violated federal antitrust law and the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act by refusing to register horses produced by cloning.
“We've asked for nothing special,” they said. “All we want to do is compete like everyone else, just enter the market.”
The AQHA, the official body of quarter horse racing, issued a statement late Monday indicating that it will ask the court to enter a “take-nothing judgment” in favor of the association “based upon the fact that the jury's verdict was not supported by the evidence entered at trial.” If that motion is dismissed, it said it will appeal the verdict.
Nancy Stone, one of four attorneys representing the plaintiffs -- Abraham and Texas veterinarian Gregg Veneklasen -- said an appeal could delay the registering of cloned quarter horses for about a year if U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson issued a stay of their order in the interim.
Cloning of animals is accomplished by transplanting the genetic information from a cell in a donor animal – either dead or alive -- into an unfertilized egg cell whose genetic information has been destroyed or physically removed. In the case of horses, that egg is then implanted into a surrogate mare, where — if everything goes smoothly — it develops into a viable foal.
The effort to force the AQHA to accept clones has been controversial. Proponents of cloning say it offers a way to return the DNA of champions who are either deceased or otherwise unable to reproduce to the genetic pool and could help reduce diseases prevalent in quarter horses by enabling breeders to “silence detrimental genes.”

Horse cloners try to force their way into the starting gate
The AQHA, on the other hand, argued that cloning doesn't improve the breed and would render unusable its DNA-based system of tracking horses' pedigrees.
Quarter horse racing, which generated more than $300 million in wagering at U.S. racetracks in 2012, is the third most popular form of equine racing after thoroughbred and standardbred racing, and quarter horses also are prized in rodeo events for their athleticism.
The acceptance of clones into the quarter horse registry would be the most-visible victory to date for backers of the technology, but the cloning of animals for food and sport is growing by leaps and bounds.
The FDA concluded in January 2008 that meat and milk from cow, pig and goat clones and the offspring of any animal clones are safe, opening the door to the commercial sale of such products, which are now both widespread and unlabeled.
Equine clones or their offspring are expected to appear before the year is out in other equine sporting venues – including non-breed specific rodeo competitions like barrel racing and reining, polo matches and equestrian events leading up to the 2014 Olympics, according to supporters of the technology.

The struggling city's mayor was blown away after a trip to Philly, and wants to apply what they learned: “We go to cities because they're gritty.”
Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian really didn't want to leave the shore. It was 3 p.m. on a beautiful June Friday, and they were having misgivings about their promise to visit Philadelphia.
“I could have had a free night to party!” says the 63-year-old Republican who is the city's first openly gay mayor, playing up the drama with their signature flair. “That very rarely happens.”
For a politician, Guardian's as effusive as they come, but there's no need for them to hyperbolize the challenge they face in getting the seaside metropolis of 39,000 back on track. Legalized gambling in other nearby states (Pennsylvania chief among them) — combined with a general tourism slowdown after the crash of 2008 — has left Atlantic City financially reeling. This spring, municipal government nearly shut down for three weeks because of a $33.5 million gap in the budget. City Hall was able to stay open thanks to a bridge loan from the state, but now faces the threat of state takeover in a charge led by N.J. Gov. Chris Christie. (Some observers say Christie is simply angling for better position in their play to get casinos approved in North Jersey.)
Guardian doesn't care about political repercussions. “At my age, I don't have to worry that I need to be doing favors for people,” they say. “I don't have to worry about moving up a political chain.”
They also don't shy away from the seriousness of the situation. When they took office in 2014, they characterized their coming tenure as “like a dentist doing a root canal” — and that was before four casinos shuttered in quick succession, decimating the city's ratables. A recent court ruling that evaluated the Borgata as taxable at just $880 million, instead of the city's estimated $2.2 billion, did not help.
There are several big picture projects Guardian has set in motion to help the city redefine itself. They worked to bring in Philadelphia developer Bart Blatstein, who revamped the defunct Caesars shopping pier and turned it into the gambling-free Playground, and plans to rebrand and re-open the former Showboat as an 850-room hotel. Developer Glenn Straub is relaunching shuttered Revel — although that has stalled as the Florida real estate magnate battles with the state over whether they personally need to apply for a gaming license to do so.
But it's actually smaller projects that have a real chance to help the scrambling city define a new, post-casino identity, say some developers, including Philly's John Longacre.
“It has to be turned from a gaming town that happens to have a beach into a beach town that happens to have gambling,” Longacre says.
They use their 80-year-old mother as an example. “Right now, the kind of person who goes to A.C. is my mom — she'll go there to see a comedian and eat at Bobby Flay's. On the other side, it's got pawn shops and dive bars and strip clubs. There just isn't a middle market in Atlantic City. We are trying to create one.”
In 2014, Longacre's LPMG Properties bought the Morris Guards Armory Building, a 30,000-square-foot historic structure in the city's Ducktown neighborhood. A planned $3 million investment will transform it from a vacant eyesore into a mixed-use apartment and retail complex. It's similar to the type of development on which Longacre has built their career — best evidenced in the ongoing revitalization of Point Breeze.
Which is why Guardian found themselves reluctantly departing the shore on that gorgeous June afternoon, heading opposite the traffic to take a look around South Philly.
“My director of planning Elizabeth [Terenik] said, ‘I know you'll like John when they speak about millennials — creating places where young people can live and work in the same neighborhood,'” Guardian explains. “And they talked about all these pop-up parks they wanted to show me, how we could do something like that in Atlantic City. So I agreed to check them out.”
When they got to Philadelphia, the mayor was wowed.
“I was thinking the whole trip would be very businesslike, and that the pop-up parks would just be little corner spots. I was rudely incorrect,” they say.
They met up with Longacre in what Guardian describes, apologetically, as “a neighborhood no one would want to drive through” and went on a tour. The mayor was especially impressed by the vibrant makerspace at NextFab, the Point Breeze Pop-Up beer garden and the combo Ultimo coffee shop/Brew bottle shop.
“We stopped at another pub-like setting [South Philadelphia Tap Room],” Guardian says, “and it became obvious to me that they had created an atmosphere that kept people in the city, even on summer weekends. People were taking pride in their neighborhood.”
The fact that Longacre didn't “eminent domain out all the poor people,” and tried to rebuild instead of just razing abandoned buildings left a lasting impression. “We go to cities because they're gritty,” the mayor says. “Miami Beach isn't like Disney.”
The tour continued to several other pop-ups around Philly, including the PHS Pop-Up on South Street — “It was as fancy as a Ritz-Carlton!” — and Spruce Street Harbor Park, where “there were 4,000 other people partying and having fun, and we ate what John said was the best fried chicken in town.”
One issue that makes revitalization in Atlantic City different is that much of its underutilized land is zoned for casino use, which limits potential investors' options. Not all of it is, however, and Guardian has begun auctioning off dozens of small lots. A real estate auction held June 23 was attended by more than 100 people, and netted $1.7 million for the city's cash-starved coffers.
Guardian hopes the intrepid investors follow Longacre's lead.
“If I had 50 Johns investing here I would be thrilled,” they say. They point to the vacant lots near what will soon become a new extension of the boardwalk, and suggests that they have the potential for lucrative independent retail.
“Before Atlantic City had gambling, it had dozens of mom-and-pop operations, but we lost the feel of it being fun to leave the hotel and hang out on the street. We need to realize we're a great urban center, not just a shore town with gambling.
“But change is never easy,” they say, and then laughs.
“I just hope that after I retire, I can sleep well at night, and then bicycle down the boardwalk and people will greet me with all five fingers when they wave.”
The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium announced that Anakka, a male western lowland gorilla, has died.
Officials said Anakka was humanely euthanized Thursday after they failed to recover from anesthesia after a routine medical procedure Monday.
“Anakka had a history of heart disease that was being managed with medication and they had been anesthetized for reevaluation,” the zoo said in a release. “It is not uncommon for male gorillas to have heart disease and while the animal care team has developed specialized blood pressure cuffs to safely monitor their health, sedation is still necessary to perform most medical procedures on the great apes.”
“The veterinary and animal care teams have been providing them with medical care around the clock since the procedure,” said Dr. Randy Junge, DVM and Vice President of Animal Health. “Unfortunately they were unresponsive with no sign of recovery and the very difficult decision was made to humanely euthanize him.”
Anakka was born at the Philadelphia Zoo on June 1, 1985 and they have lived at the Columbus Zoo since 1993 where they sired four offspring.
Median life expectancy for gorillas in North American zoos is 31.9 years of age.
“Anakka's gorilla and human families were given time to mourn their passing. They were very special to the Columbus Zoo. They were an excellent father, incredibly smart and charismatic” said Assistant Curator Audra Meinelt. “He was a fantastic troop leader who was loved by their females. They will be greatly missed.”
Zoo staff members are requesting that memories of Anakka be posted on the Zoo's Facebook page.
Romanian President meets German Chancellor in Berlin
Romanian President Klaus Iohannis started a three-day visit to Germany on Monday, June 19, with a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The two officials held a joint press conference after the meeting, during which Angela Merkel said that Romania has made progresses since joining the EU, including in the fight against corruption. They also added that these reforms must continue in Romania, and thanked President Iohannis for supporting them.
In return, the Romanian President said that the talks with Chancellor Merkel included topics such as the economic relations between the two countries, Romania's EU Council Presidency, and the country's accession the Schengen. In the latter theme's case, Iohannis said that Angela Merkel encouraged further talks with other European leaders as well.
When asked about the ongoing political scandal within the ruling party in Romania, the German Chancellor refrained from further commenting, saying: “I have said that we would want the democracy and the rule of law in Romania strengthened, otherwise I do not want to express my opinion. These are domestic problems of Romania.”
On the same topic, President Iohannis said: “As for the political crisis at home, naturally the Chancellor doesn't want to express an opinion, but we had a brief discussion on this issue and I think we managed to convey the message that we have a crisis within the governing coalition, but that Romania is a stable, solid, well-functioning country, and I have urged those involved in these divergences to find urgent solutions, which will undoubtedly happen.”
Iohannis previously asked the coalition to solve their political crisis as soon as possible to avoid political instability, after the Social Democratic Party (PSD) leaders managed to isolate Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu in an attempt to force their resignation. Last week, coalition partners PSD and ALDE announced that they withdrew the political support for the cabinet led by Sorin Grindeanu, after less than six months in power.
President Ioahnnis' visit to Berlin will end on June 21. The official program also includes a meeting with German President Frank Steinmeier.
Klaus Iohannis is to have yet another important visit this month, with French President Emmanuel Macron.
The Romanian President was in the US between June 4 and June 9, the visit ending with a meeting with President Trump at the White House. At the end of the meeting, the two heads of state held a joint press conference in which Donald Trump praised the Romanian President for leading the fight against corruption in Romania and for the country's efforts to increase its defense spending. They also said that the future of Romania and the country's relations with the United States is very bright.

US mobile operator Sprint appears to be eyeing a launch of 5G services based on 2.5GHz spectrum in the second half of 2019.
Earlier today the operator revealed that it has been collaborating with Japanese owner SoftBank Corp. and US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. (Nasdaq: QCOM) on the development of 2.5GHz-based 5G technologies, and that commercial services and devices could arrive in the market in late 2019.
Sprint Corp. (NYSE: S) already holds 2.5GHz licenses and told reporters at this year's Mobile World Congress in February that it was interested in using the spectrum to provide 5G services. (See Sprint Gets Ready for Massive MIMO, Eyes 2.5GHz for 5G.)
Since then, the 3GPP has approved plans to speed up the development of 5G new radio specifications, meaning the first commercial services could feasibly enter the market in 2019 rather than the previously expected date of 2020. (See 3GPP Approves Plans to Fast Track 5G NR.)
The Sprint announcement comes shortly after rival T-Mobile US Inc. said it would build a nationwide 5G network by 2020 using spectrum in the 600MHz and other frequency bands. (See T-Mobile's 2020 Plan Piles Pressure on Europe's 5G Players, Is T-Mobile's 5G Plan Just a Pipe Dream? and T-Mobile Promises 'Nationwide' 5G in 2020 With New Spectrum.)
AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), the country's two biggest mobile operators, are also aiming for early rollouts of 5G technology based on much higher frequency bands, including the 28GHz range that is also the focus of much 5G attention in Japan and South Korea.
Signals travel further in lower spectrum bands than in higher ranges, meaning these airwaves are much better for covering large geographical areas.
The very high bands, by contrast, can deliver much faster services -- simply because more spectrum is available -- but do a relatively poor job on coverage.
That means the cost of building a nationwide US network based on 28GHz spectrum could be as much as $300 billion, compared with about $25 billion for a 600MHz-based system, according to operators and analysts that have spoken with Light Reading. (See The Growing Pains of 5G and T-Mobile 5G Plan Could Drive Capex to Record Highs.)
Sprint's 2.5GHz holdings are perhaps best categorized as "mid-band" frequencies that fall somewhere between the spectrum extremes in terms of their capabilities.
In their statement on the latest 5G collaboration, SoftBank and Sprint flagged interest in using 2.5GHz spectrum for "accelerated wide-scale 5G deployments."

Despite the focus on very high frequency bands in the US and parts of Asia, operators in Europe are looking at using mid-band 3.5GHz spectrum to provide 5G services.
T-Mobile's 600MHz plans could also give a boost to the low-band 5G scenario, with European telcos now thinking of using 700MHz spectrum to support 5G service offerings, according to Heavy Reading Principal Analyst Gabriel Brown.
But the plethora of 5G frequency bands could impede the development of devices and services that can be used around the world, prompting concern about spectrum fragmentation.
Such fragmentation has already bedeviled the rollout of 4G services, which are delivered over a multitude of spectrum bands in different regions of the world.
News of the SoftBank-led 5G collaboration came on the same day the Japanese operator reported a trebling of its net income for 2016, to 1.43 trillion Japanese yen ($12.6 billion), on flat revenues of JPY8.9 trillion ($78.3 billion).
Profits were boosted by asset sales last year as SoftBank worked on reducing net debts, which currently equal about three times the company's annual earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization).

Sanders, Warren Urge FCC to Ban 'Pay for Privacy' ISP Schemes
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have come out swinging against ISPs and cable companies that treat privacy like a luxury consumer option. Over the years we've noted how this has increasingly been the case at ISPs like AT&T, which charges its consumers a very steep premium if they want to opt out of AT&T's deep packet inspection snoopvertising.
For example, AT&T U-Verse users may pay $30 or more per month just to avoid being part of AT&T's "Internet Preferences" behavioral marketing and tracking system.
In a letter (pdf) sent to the FCC, Warren, Sanders and four other Senators support the FCC's push for new privacy rules that would forbid this kind of privacy surcharge.
"Every click a consumer makes online paints a detailed picture of their personal and professional lives, and this sensitive information should be protected by strong privacy standards," the Senators state.
The FCC is doing just that. With ISPs now classified as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act, they're now subject to rules governing CPNI (Customer Proprietary Network Information). Tom Wheeler wants to update these rules, specifically built for old phone providers, so they adhere to the modern era. And again, that would include preventing ISPs from charging consumers that want to opt out of user tracking.
"Not only is a pay-for-privacy standard counter to our nation's core principle that all Americans have a fundamental right to privacy, but it also may disproportionately harm low-income customers, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations," they Senators write.
In addition to requiring clear privacy policies, working opt out tools and banning "pay for privacy" schemes, the FCC would likely ban cable companies from giving lower quality service to low-income customers (something Cable One's CEO recently bragged their company has been doing), or customers who refuse to participate in marketing and monetization schemes.
ISPs and the advertising companies that profit off such schemes (increasingly one in the same ) have unsurprisingly claimed that privacy rules are completely unnecessary and would only act to burden and confuse consumers.
Appendix to the World Rugby Policy on Hygiene, Infection Control and Prevention of Infection: World Rugby Statement on HIV
World Rugby Statement on HIV
World Rugby does not discriminate and does not have any policy which prevents HIV positive Players from playing the Game.
“Transmission of HIV is estimated to be 1:43 million games based on the estimated prevalence of HIV infection amongst athletes, the risk of percutaneous HIV transmission in health care and the risk of bleeding injury in American football. Individuals and sports medicine physicians should be aware of the principles of post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV infection.”
The full policy is available
here.
Despite these low risks, World Rugby emphasises strong preventative measures for the spread of blood borne diseases:
Law 3.11(a) requires that Players with open or bleeding wounds must leave the field to have the bleeding controlled and the wound covered.
Law 4.4(a) prohibits Players from wearing any item that is contaminated by blood.
World Rugby Regulations 15.2.1(c) and 15.3.1 set out the Match doctor's role in relation to monitoring blood injuries in International Matches. In brief, the Match doctor's role is to supervise the appropriate treatment of any blood injury and to ensure that the bleeding is stemmed, the wound is covered and all blood-stained apparel removed prior to the Player returning to the field. World Rugby recommends that where possible this best practice is implemented at non-International Matches also.
The Laws of the Game and the World Rugby Regulations Relating to the Game are available on
laws.worldrugby.org.
World Rugby recommends that any Players who are or may be HIV positive consult with their physician to ensure that their own health and welfare are considered prior to participating or continuing to participate in the Game.
Appropriate consideration should also be given to confidentiality with respect to a Player's HIV positive status. This may require applicable local laws and regulations to be taken into account.
The online qualifiers for the upcoming series of Minors will be run by CEVO, with the tournament organizer revealing details about the CIS, European and American competitions.
Shortly after the first Major of 2018 has been announced, CEVO revealed that they will be hosting the online qualifiers for the Minors and revealed details about the competitions.
Qualifiers for the upcoming Major will be starting soon
The CIS open qualifier will be the first one to start, taking place on October 9-10. The qualifier will feature a 256-team single-elimination bracket, with BO1 matches until the round of 32, when BO3's will start.
Six teams will qualify for the Minor directly from the open online qualifier, with Spirit and Tengri invited to the CIS Minor Championship, which will be held on October 26th-29th in Bucharest, Romania.
The CIS Minor will look like this:
Spirit Tengri Qualifier Qualifier Qualifier Qualifier Qualifier Qualifier
The European open qualifier will follow, taking place on October 13-14, with the format being the same as in the CIS qualifier—up to 256 teams, with BO1's up to the round of 32 matches.
With only one open qualifier, the eight top placed teams will move on to the closed portion, where eight invited teams will await. The closed qualifier will be played out as a BO1 16-team Swiss group stage on October 15, with three losses leading to elimination and three wins earning you the spot at the EU Minor Championship, which will take place on November 2-5 in Bucharest.
The following teams have been invited to the EU Minor closed qualifier, where they will be joined by eight more open qualifier teams:
The North American qualification matches will be played out on the same days as the European ones, with October 13-14 being reserved for the open part and the closed stage being played on October 15. Once again, eight teams will advance from the open qualifier, but in the Swiss stage, teams will be eliminated after just two BO1 losses, with only the top five teams advancing to the Americas Minor.
Interestingly, Immortals have been listed among the teams invited to the North American closed qualifier:
South America will have its own open qualifier, with the winner of the 256-team bracket advancing directly to the Americas Minor, which will be held in Toronto, on November 2-5.
Liquid and CLG have been invited directly to the ELEAGUE Major Boston - Americas Minor Championship, making the team list look like this:
Liquid CLG NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. NA closed qual. SA qualifier
The Asia Minor, which will be held on October 26-29 in Seoul, wont have an online qualifier, but only direct invites.
Three infants were beaten to death in a village on the outskirts of Yangon by a man purporting to be a healer, who told their families they were possessed by evil spirits.
The mystic allegedly punched and kicked two toddlers and an eight-month-old baby to death during exorcism rituals last week, according to police and relatives. Lieutenant Major Kyaw Naing Soe said the “exorcist” put the villagers into a trance, then killed the children as they watched.
“On the night of the 18th, the three-year-old boy was beaten to death and the culprit threw them in the Twante Canal,” they told AFP. “On their return, they continued to beat the three young girls and two of them were killed.”
U Tun Naing, the uncle of the dead boy, said the villagers had lost their senses after the exorcist fed them “blessed” water, then made them stand in a circle as they chanted and cast spells.
“Because of what they did everyone was out of their mind,” U Tun Naing told AFP, their eyes still glazed.
“I still feel afraid of something in my mind. I don't understand what is happening ... Some people have gone to other mystics to release themselves from the curse.”
Only a handful of people attended the dead boy's funeral on October 22 in Twante, a town south of Myanmar's commercial capital. U Tun Naing said most family members were still too scared to show their faces in public.
Young novice monks covered their noses with their maroon robes to block the smell as the tiny body was carried past on a stretcher, before being buried in an unmarked grave.
A police report said the bodies of the dead children – a boy, three, a two-year-old girl and the baby – showed evidence of having been punched, kicked and stamped on.
Health workers alerted authorities after the father of another little girl who had been beaten brought them to the hospital covered in bruises.
Police have charged the “exorcist” with murder, grievous bodily harm and hiding a dead body.  They are being held in Insein prison.
There are a lot of reasons this is being written, but the first is the most important. The people who need to be convinced vaping is safe aren't lawmakers. They aren't doctors, regulators, or any other type of specialist. They're your neighbors, your friends, your co-workers, and your family. The people we walk among every day who eye us suspiciously when we pull a humongous MOD out of our pocket and blow a massive cloud in the parking lot.
Every family member who has seen someone quit by vaping can become an advocate. Every co-worker who notices you don't smell like smoke anymore can be an ally, but it's our job to arm them with the right information. That means we have to be smart about what we advocate to each other and where we get our information. Perhaps most importantly, we have to give a positive face to vaping. We exist in a contentious industry, and staying clean is important if you want people to listen to you and have faith and trust in what you say. Picking the battles that matter, and winning them in a way that we don't fall into partisanship, bias, and anger is how we all get ahead, vapers and non-vapers alike, for good.
This piece is about being an all around smart vaper. It's about realizing that people judge us without ever speaking to us, by the way we act and speak about vaping. One bad impression can keep someone from picking up a vape, or worse yet, get them to influence who knows how many friends or loved ones not to. In a world where it seems like the only ones who see the “truth” about vaping are vapers themselves, there are avenues of support many of us have overlooked, grassroots ones. The whole e-cigarette industry is one where every side preaches to the choir constantly. If you want to change hearts, habits, and minds, you have to step outside of your comfort zone, and speak to the people who can help without having anything to gain, except a better world.
Remember the Truth campaign? I do. As a smoker, it was an uncertain time. The evil of smoking is that the damage is hidden, and that forced a lot of us to ask ourselves questions about what was actually being hidden. Even bigger than that, the truth campaign stirred a largely ambivalent audience against smoking, and more specifically, against big tobacco. Most of those it reached were non smokers, who rose up; convinced smoking was going to kill them. It created a swell of public opinion that not only crippled Big Tobacco, but gave prompt rise to the e-cig industry. It's only logical, after all, that if cigarettes are evil, cessation methods will bloom.
Boy did they. I knew people who tried Chantix, patches, gums, etc. All of these were approved methods for smoking cessation based in existing pharmaceutical markets. Consumers felt safe with respect to them. Vaping is a new thing, and quite frankly, one that does not put money into FDA, FTC, or any other regulatory group's coffers. That's a real obstacle, because agencies like the FDA are largely funded by Big Pharma. Which voices we hear these days depends largely on money, and the Truth campaign spent a truly staggering amount of it, in fact, it still does, funded by Big Tobacco itself, at the requirement of a civil settlement.
This brings us back to the original point. How do you fight against money without money? There are tons of tobacco interests, and all of them have a stake in the game. If tobacco goes away, so do they, and they have no chips in the vaping game. That means in order to combat their agenda; we need to do it with the kind of information that isn't put into TV commercials or crazy expensive billboard campaigns. In this battle, every vaper has real impact and a role to play. We teach those around us about vaping by what we know, how we speak about it, and most importantly, the respect we CHOOSE to show. Many of us carry that smokers chip after years of being forced outside and demonized, and want our due now that our preferred nicotine delivery system is safe for those around us. That doesn't mean we're owed it, it just means we have a few more years to work on helping others learn that.
Many of us want to be advocates for vaping, and that means being respectful, knowledgable, and current. Here's a list of links and resources we think should be daily visits for any vaper looking to learn, network, or help others by sharing their knowledge and experience.
(NOTE: We were not solicited to post these nor are we being compensated. This is just a good honest list of sources and communities we trust and think represent the best spirit of education, cooperation, tolerance, and debate in the vaping community. )
ECF (The e-cigarette forum) – This is a vaper fueled community. They have ads on the forum, but pretty minimally. As to the quality of the information, it can be variable, but it's a place where most knowledgeable vapers either do interact, or have at some point.
ECR (Reddit e-cigarette subreddit) – If you're not familiar with Reddit, it's time you get acquainted. It's the best place to stay up to date on fast moving news and keep tabs on what interests you right now. The community there is hugely knowledgeable and active, if sometimes sophomoric, but always helpful. In terms of internet experiences, it's probably the most like chatting with people in a B&M about whatever topics you're into.

The future of the United States Air Force is a human-piloted, $100 million stealth jet guiding flocks of $3 million drones that glide effortlessly into position powered by turbo fans. Thanks to the Air Force Research Lab and drone-maker Kratos, that future of combined human/robot formation is already being tested. There are many good reasons to want a human in the cockpit of a plane, including their judgement, fast-thinking skills, and the capability to respond to unexpected threats. But there are hard physical obstacles that suggest maybe not every plane needs to have a pilot. Humans need systems to stay alive, and those systems sometimes break. Earlier this month, Air Force F-35As were grounded because the system supplying oxygen to pilots failed, and the F-22 struggled with oxygen problems for years as well. Another challenge is the gravitational force on a pilot from sudden and sharp maneuvers; there is an upper limit on how much force a human body can withstand before they black out and possibly die. Finally, there's the simple calculation of the value of a human pilot—they're expensive, and their deaths, compared to that of a robot, matter, so the incentives are all in place to make a plane that can keep pilots safe. Not so when it comes to robots. The term d'art is “attritable,” which is Pentagon-speak for “cheap enough that it's okay to replace it if it's lost.” And Kratos has a lot of experience making drones ultimately built to be replaced. “Our heritage from the beginning of time was to develop inexpensive airplane systems that are rugged enough to withstand the ground impact,” says Steve Fendley, president of the unmanned systems division of Kratos. “Targets are designed to be shot at, possibly even hit. Our target systems can take a missile strike to the wing that destroys the wing, deploy a parachute, land, and all we need to do is replace that wing. So you replace the components that are designed to be replaceable, and very inexpensive, and then fly again.” The primary target drone Fendley is talking about is the BQM-167 aerial target, which can cost between $750,000 and $900,000, depending on the options selected and the size of the order. That body is the basis for the Mako, one of two combat drones designed and built by Kratos. The Mako can fly at altitudes anywhere from 20 feet to 50,000 feet, at up to 690 mph, and with a maximum range of 1400 nautical miles (or 700 miles each way on a round trip). Depending on the size of the order, it will cost between $1.5 and $2 million, according to Fendley. Like the target drone it's based on, the Mako uses rocket-assisted takeoffs to get airborne, instead of traveling down a runway. That requires a launch space in the 10s of square feet, so several Mako drones could presumably be launched from a small area. And the drones are geared for combat. The Mako can carry payloads internally, on wing stations and on wing tips. Payloads could be anything from fuel tanks to extend its range, bombs intended for targets on the ground, and even air-to-air missiles. And it can do aerial maneuvers at up to 12 Gs, beyond what a human pilot can endure without losing consciousness.

“Valkyrie” is the largest of Kratos' combat drones, and depending on the options selected and the size of the order, it could be produced for a unit cost of between $2 and $3 million each. The Valkyrie isn't as fast as the Mako, though by no means slow: it has a top speed of 650 mph. It can cover a range of over 3,000 nautical miles while carrying a standard payload, or more than enough to fly from Los Angeles to Boston. Powering the Valkyrie is a turbofan engine, like those typically found in business jets, which makes it more fuel-efficient than the turbo-jet in the Mako. It can fly at altitudes between 50 feet and 45,000 feet. It has a wingspan of 22 feet and a length of 29 feet, making it about 20 feet shorter and 10 feet narrower than the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Both Mako and Valkyrie can deploy parachutes at the end of their mission, gently falling to the ground for recovery and repair, ready to perform another mission. Oh, and it might just drop a swarm of small drones from the internal bay that runs most of the plane's length. That bay can carry “anything from weapon systems to UAVs,” says Fendley. “It can carry, let's call it a volley of small UAVs, and it can deploy those UAVs to either be its wingmen or to go conduct a mission of their own.” “Drone” is a big category, and it includes everything from plane-sized vehicles like the Valkyrie to much smaller quadcopters. The biggest advantage of small drones is that costs allow for great numbers. The biggest weakness is limited flight times and ranges, so a big drone that can carry many small drones in its belly and unleash them when needed is a best-of-both-worlds scenario. The Air Force, aware that it needs a cheaper way to deal with threats, is looking seriously at small drones as a way to stop missiles or launch aerial attacks. In 2015, DARPA released a concept video showing drones, stealth fighters, and cargo planes working together to attack enemy defenses. Expendable drones scout ahead, and relay information back to the stealth fighter. That stealth fighter, in turn, relays information to a decidedly conspicuous cargo plane, which releases drones and missiles to hit targets. While none of the planes in the concept are explicitly named, it's easy to see a Kratos Valkyrie fulfilling the role of the drone, an F-35 as the stealth fighter, and a C-130 as the cargo plan. If the Valkyrie itself could release an additional swarm of smaller drones, an air defense system built to tackle large planes could be overwhelmed. The Air Force is already working on drone swarms, which fly together as a loud, buzzing, autonomous unit, like especially large, mechanical bees. The swarm is a future potential, one the Air Force is exploring but not yet in a useful, military form. Individual combat drones like the Mako and Valkyrie are much closer to realization. In 2015, the Air Force sent out a request for “Low Cost Attritable Strike UAS Demonstration,” which is the cheaper combat drone program that ultimately led to the Kratos Valkyrie. Besides a small price tag, the Air Force wanted “long range, high speed strike capability in remote regions where forward basing is difficult or prohibited,” perhaps thinking of a future where runways won't always be available but air support is still required. In 2016, Kratos won the $40.8 million dollar contract to develop the vehicle, which lead to the Valkyrie. Notably, the contract required a vehicle that could do “defensive counter air manoeuvres, offensive counter air manoeuvres, the suppression of enemy air defences and the destruction of enemy air defences,” or tasks in the past performed by versatile fighter-bombers (in modern military parlance, a “strike aircraft”).

Anil Kapoor feels intolerance always existed in the country and is not happening for the first time. Many writers and filmmakers including director Dibakar Banerjee have returned their national honours.
Actor Anil Kapoor does not think returning awards in protest against growing intolerance in the country is justified.

The “24” star feels intolerance always existed in the country and is not happening for the first time. Many writers and filmmakers including director Dibakar Banerjee have returned their national honours.
When asked if it is right to return the awards, Anil said,” No I don't think so.”
The debate stirred up after Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, on their 50th birthday, came out strongly against what they called “extreme intolerance” in the country and said
insularity towards creativity and religion will hurt the country.
Anil, 58, who was in the capital to meet Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh to take measures for cyber protection, said they have not heard Shah Rukh's comment.
“I haven't heard what they (Shah Rukh) has spoken. As far as I know him, I don't think that there would be any such thing in their mind.
“My stand is this thing (intolerance) is not something that's happening only in this government or in the previous government. We have been telling this irrespective of whether it was the Congress government or the BJP, that we should live together in harmony.
[related-post]
Many BJP MP's slammed Shah Rukh over their remark, with Yogi Adityanath likening them to Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed.
Actor-filmmaker Anupam Kher came out in support of their “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” co-star, saying politicians should stop talking rubbish about him.

While Salman refused to be drawn into the debate over BJP leaders' attack on Shah Rukh, Sonam Kapoor said “anything that is intolerant or that is said without complete evidence is unacceptable”.
A 15-story tower of Ferraris and Lamborghinis in glass boxes has become a quirky landmark in Singapore. And it all started with a visit to Toys R Us.
Struggling with a lack of space at their sports car showroom, Gary Hong was inspired by a vertical display of Matchbox cars while shopping at the toy store with their son.
Hong, 45, has turned their vision into a 148-foot tower housing some of the world's most expensive cars.
"We decided to build something a bit different to solve the problem," Hong, general manager at Autobahn Motors, told CNNMoney.
Related: This vending machine dispenses cars
Believed to be the world's tallest "car vending machine," Autobahn's tower displays roughly 60 different vehicles, ranging from newer models such as the Lamborghini Aventador to more collectible cars such as the Ferrari 512M.
The cars arrive at the touch of a button using a mobile app customized by Autobahn, and a video showcasing the customer's chosen car plays while they wait for it to reach the ground for a viewing, test drive or sale.
The experience isn't entirely self-service, though. Staff supervise customers when they request a vehicle.
Hong's creation isn't a new concept. Car vending machines have sprung up in countries around the world in recent years, including the U.S. and Japan. Aside from their novelty value, they solve dealers' longstanding problem of how to showcase more cars using a limited amount of land -- a big issue in densely populated Singapore.
Since it was built in December, visitors have flocked to see the Singapore tower -- and not just potential customers. Land developers struggling to find enough space for car parking have also paid frequent visits to the showroom, Hong said.

Autobahn has managed to turn some of that attention into money, too. Sales rose roughly 30% in the first quarter of this year compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, Hong said.
Their team is now busy patenting some of the technology, which they plan to sell to businesses looking to solve inventory management problems in China and other countries.
EDITORIAL: Time is running out to sign up for Obamacare
The deadline to sign up for Obamacare is Dec. 15. | AP file photo
Despite efforts to kill Obamacare, the demand for it is growing.
Through the first four weeks of an abbreviated open enrollment period, almost 95,500 people in Illinois have signed up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which is a big jump from about 68,000 in the first four weeks of open enrollment last year.
Nationally, nearly 2.8 million people have enrolled compared with about 2.1 million at this time last year.
But those still interested in signing up had better hurry. The enrollment window this year closes on Dec. 15.
EDITORIAL
The Trump administration shortened the sign-up period for Obamacare to about six weeks this year — down from three months in previous years — in an attempt to undermine the program. In a two-prong attack, the president and Republicans in Congress also are attempting to kill the program by ramming through a tax code reform that eliminates an Obamacare requirement that people get health insurance or pay a fine. If that happened, premiums for everybody else would rise and fewer people would be covered.
As it is, by shrinking the enrollment window, the Trump administration has all but guaranteed fewer sign-ups.
To sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, go to healthcare.gov or getcovered.illinois.gov. You also can call (866) 311-1119 Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and on Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.

A caravan made from more than 215,000 Lego bricks has been put on display at the NEC near Birmingham.
Twelve people took more than 1,000 hours to make the replica caravan which includes working electric lights, seats and a sink with running water.
Organisers of the Motorhome & Caravan Show 2015, where it is on show, said it is the world's largest caravan built with interlocking plastic bricks.
Items made of toy bricks include toothbrushes and a frying pan.
The replica Tab caravan has been put next to a real one at the show.

James Bissett, marketing campaign director for NCC Events, organisers of the show, said: "To get the (Guinness) world record it had to be identical in every way in terms of the size, dimensions, look and functionality.
"Inside you can change the beds and the table as you can in the real thing."
It was unveiled at the show to celebrate 130 years of leisure caravanning this year, with the 2.2m tall and 3.6m long structure featuring "a full interior" according to show organisers.

The Lego brick caravan was certified the world's largest by an official Guinness World Records adjudicator, organisers said.
It is on display at the show until Sunday.
The Boom Coaster is one of several new ride patents filed by Universal Creative that may offer up a hint about some future attractions in development. You can see some of the concept drawings from the patent forms posted in a slideshow from the Orlando Business Journal, though keep in mind that they are keeping the theme and concept as generic as they can in these patent applications, instead focusing on the technology aspect of what the attraction will do in order to make it unique enough to deserve a patent. The article speculates on how these patents might be applied at Universal parks across the globe, and the majority point towards rides for the forthcoming Super Nintendo World themed lands.
Universal's Boom Coaster Concept
The Universal patent that really caught my eye was one referred to as the “boom coaster” concept. The drawings included in the patent show a mine cart themed ride vehicle that would look as if it is attached to a mine train type track system, but in reality the car is attached to a boom arm that goes down under the cart and attaches to a typical roller coaster track entirely hidden from view by themed elements.
The concept would allow for the hidden coaster track to go up and down hills without the riders being able to see what is coming next. For example, it would allow for the mine cart to appear to “jump” a gap in the scenic mine cart track, while staying connected to the hidden coaster track system below.
This concept looks like it was made solely for a Donkey Kong Country attraction. See for yourself:
How would a Donkey Kong coaster work? Here's a quick CAD simulation I created to show how the boom coaster might function:
One challenge for the designer's of the boom coaster is the rider's heartline is so far away from the coaster's track. When banking into a curve, if the axis of rotation is about the spine of the track then the center of gravity of the passenger is accelerated toward the center of the curve. This results in the passenger being thrown against the side of the car or against another passenger.
Roller coasters must not put too much strain on a rider. To correct for this acceleration, the track should be rotated around the center line, or heartline of the passengers (roughly just above the center of a human torso). Thus, the acceleration of the passengers to the inside of the curve is greatly reduced. The track would have to swing out really wide when going into a banked turn.
If the boom coaster actually gets built I would envision it more as an indoor wild mouse type coaster with smaller drops and horizontal curves.
The Cantilevered Coaster System
As soon as I saw the boom coaster concept I couldn't help thinking I had seen something like this before. And then it dawned on me; the boom coaster is a more simplified version of the cantilevered coaster! What is the cantilevered coaster concept? As the inventor, John Hogg, told us back in 2010:
“The CRC system uses two tracks, each with a vehicle chassis on it, one above the other. A support arm is mounted to the lower chassis on pivot bearing, and runs up through a gimbaled, sliding bearing in the upper chassis. The guests ride in the themed portion of the vehicle mounted to the top of the arm on a pivoting bearing, above the upper track and chassis. As the complete vehicle moves along the track course, the upper track and chassis serve as a kind of fulcrum for the support arm. The lower track follows a slightly different course than the upper track, and this causes the top of support arm and the guests to swing in a side to side yaw movement, pitch front to back, and an up and down vertical stroke relative to the upper track.”
It's kind of like ride systems employing a multi-axis simulator sitting on a tracked chassis (i.e. Indiana Jones, Spider-Man, etc.), but without all the hydraulics and servos of those systems, plus the ability to move on an undulating, coaster-style track. The major difference between Universal's boom coaster and the cantilevered coaster is the CRC uses two tracks and thus has not only up and down movement up side to side movement as well.
Check out the compilation video below to see what types of motions the CRC might be capable of:
I'd love to see a cantilevered coaster built but the industry seems to be more focused on motion bases and projection systems for the foreseeable future.
Boom Coaster or Cantilevered Coaster?
What do you think? Which embodiment of the concept do you prefer? Will we see either concept make it off the drawing board and actually get built? If so, where do you think it will pop up and with what theme?
Five games and 484 game minutes into the 2014 season, the back of the Stanford net remains untouched.
Through five matches — four against ranked opponents — Cardinal goalkeepers Jane Campbell and Sarah Cox have yet to concede a goal, tying a school record to start a season. In that span, Campbell, a sophomore and one of the most highly touted young goalkeepers in the world, has recorded four solo clean sheets, bringing their career total up to ten.
Following a monumental season-opening 1-0 overtime win over the then-No. 4 North Carolina in Chapel Hill — one that broke a 13-match losing streak to the Tarheels — and a 2-0 victory over No. 18 Duke, the Stanford women's soccer squad (4-0-1) faced another tough test at No. 14 Portland on Aug. 30.
The Cardinal defense dominated the Pilots despite the absence of talented central defender Maddie Bauer, who missed the game due to a minor injury. With Bauer out, senior Hannah Farr made their first career start at outside back as junior Laura Liedle shifted to the center back role, teaming up with experienced fifth-year senior Kendall Romine in the middle.
On the offensive end, senior forward Chioma Ubogagu scored the game's only goal in the 30th minute with a clinical left-footed finish from 12 yards out. The goal was Ubogagu's second in the young season with their first coming in the 99th minute of Stanford's overtime victory over UNC.
After starting the season with three wins over ranked teams away from home, the Cardinal finally returned to The Farm to take on the UC-Santa Barbara Gauchos on Sept. 4. Bauer returned to the starting lineup as the Stanford back line continued their dominating start to the season.
Ubogagu was once again the catalyst offensively; in the 16th minute, the senior delivered a shot on goal that was saved, but allowed sophomore forward Ryan Walker-Hartshorn to cash in on the ensuing scramble.
Three minutes later, Ubogagu added a goal of their own following a beautiful through ball from first-year student midfielder Andi Sullivan. Ubogagu handled the pass brilliantly, dribbled into the penalty area and scored their third goal of the season from their signature left foot.
In goal, Campbell was barely challenged, registering just one save before the half while their backup, Cox, made just one save as well in the second half. In total, the overmatched Gauchos only managed to deliver five shots.
On Sunday, Sept. 7, the Cardinal returned to action at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium, taking on another ranked opponent in No. 25 Notre Dame. Although Campbell picked up another clean sheet, Stanford was unable to secure the victory, going scoreless through regulation and two periods of extra time. The 0-0 final score snapped the Cardinal's four-game winning streak, but another strong defensive performance helped keep Stanford out of the loss column.
The Cardinal had several scoring chances against the Irish, but failed to convert. Senior midfielder Alex Doll, senior forward Taylor Uhl and Ubogagu all barely missed on scoring opportunities in either the second half or overtime.
After the match, Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe praised their team's defensive performance, but also emphasized the importance on finishing offensively.
“The whole team is contributing to the defense. The back four is very strong,” Ratcliffe said. “The hardest part is scoring goals. That's where we need to keep growing. It was one of those days. That's where you need to finish the job.”
Stanford will have a chance to break its offensive dry spell on Friday when the No. 8 Florida Gators come to town. The match will mark Stanford's fifth bout against a ranked opponent in six games this season. Following Friday's contest, Stanford will take the field again on Sunday against the Dayton Flyers.

Docs: Man charged after 21 dogs found dead had history of animal cruelty Copyright by WAVY - All rights reserved Image Credit: Hampton Police Division [ + - ] Video
HAMPTON, Va. (WAVY) -- A 58-year-old Hampton man is facing more than 60 counts after 21 dead pit bulls were found inside a home on Monday.
Hampton police tweeted Thursday afternoon that Vernon Alonzo Silver was arrested Wednesday night and charged in connection with the investigation.

Police were called to a house in the 200 block of Pochin Place Monday morning in reference to an unusual smell coming from a home. Officers went inside and discovered the 21 dead dogs and one still living. The surviving dog is at the Peninsula Regional Animal Shelter, where it is undergoing an extensive screening process, which is expected to take several weeks, according to police.
According to court documents, police also seized syringes and growth supplements from the home. Hampton Police Public Information Officer Cpl. Ashley Jenrette could not confirm whether Silver is suspected of dog fighting.
10 On Your Side covered a case in April 2014 in which Vernon Silver was issued 32 summonses for failure to provide adequate care and animal cruelty. Animal Control removed more than a dozen pit bulls from a home on Abbey Court living in unsafe conditions.
In 2015, they were found guilty of animal cruelty.
"What we need, is for the courts to bring penalties to animal abusers, of any kind, that are the maximum," said Debra Griggs, President of the Virginia Federation of Humane Societies.
Griggs urges neighbors to be observant of suspicious behaviors, and to call animal control, perhaps more than once, should they notice anything.
10 On Your Side returned to the home on Abbey Court, Thursday. No one answered the door. Neighbors stated that Silver's family still lives there. Police were observed on the block this week.
Outside of the home on Pochin Place, animal advocates have created a makeshift memorial. Twenty-one roses represent the deceased pit bulls. One pink rose represents the surviving dog, which advocates have named "Lucky."
At the home on Saturday, starting at 5 p.m., advocates plan to hold a vigil for the dogs.
"These animals cannot be forgotten," said Misty Collins. "This can't be in vain."
Silver declined an interview with 10 On Your Side from the Hampton City Jail.  They are due in court later this month.

Is Paleo Chinese Food Real Life?
Chinese? Collard greens? Do not fret loyal reader, this recipe is stupid easy once again. You might actually convince yourself that you can cook in 10 minutes total effort from prep to cleanup. Phew.
I often vary my spices to help keep things interesting, and of course spicy. If you don't love the spicy as much as I do, just use less spicy on yours. When eating with Paleo sauces and seasonings, the mustard seed is a great way to vary the kick in your meals. This recipe requires browning the chicken in a skillet first, which makes it one more thing to clean up, and more than one thing to do. If you are super lazy and want to cheat, you can skip the browning phase, yet the awesome will not be as awesome as it could otherwise be.
What you need:
1.5 pounds free range pastured chicken thighs.
1 large bunch of Collard Greens. You want at least one big awesome leaf for every thigh that you have, and then 4-6 extras.
1/2 cup hot Chinese mustard. Ingredients should include only water, mustard seed, vinegar, and perhaps salt. The Chinese brand I used from the local market was only water, mustard seed, and rice vinegar.
1 medium red onion.
Clove of garlic for every chicken thigh you have.
2 teaspoons of ground cayenne pepper.
1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and/or seeds.
About 1 tbsp of coconut oil.
How you kick it:
Add your tablespoon of coconut oil to a medium-high heat skillet. Sprinkle chicken thighs with a few pinches of your cayenne pepper. You want to give the chicken some browning out the outside and some crisp. You are not looking to fully cook the thigh at this point in time, chill. Slightly wilt your collard greens so that they can wrap the chicken. You can either briefly steam them, or if you are super lazy and awful, you can wet them and throw them in the microwave for a minute or so. You simply want the stems and leaves to soften enough so that the leaves are pliable and can wrap the chicken. Don't go crazy here. Again, less is more! Mix your Chinese mustard in a bowl with your cayenne pepper and red pepper flake. Slice your garlic cloves into small slices and add them to the mustard and stir. Cut your red onion into medium slices through. You want one medium thick slice for each chicken wrap. Assemble by coating the chicken in the mustard and garlic mixture, and then place in the middle of a collard leaf. Place an onion slice on top of the thigh and wrap the collard leaf around it. Think stuffed cabbage style. Lightly grease your slow cooker with some coconut oil to ensure that the leaves on the bottom do not stick. Place your extra collards on the bottom of your slow cooker and then line the bottom with your wraps. Place 1 or 2 extra leaves on top if you have them, covering the wraps. Cook on low for 6 hours.
They should look all cute and nestled like this before cooking.
Microsoft hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping, First Lady Peng Liyuan and a high-level Chinese delegation Wednesday at its Redmond campus, where the company highlighted new technology and the role technology can play in advancing health, education and business.
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella welcomed President Xi at the company's Executive Briefing Center, where U.S. and Chinese flags adorned the building and banners lined the streets.
In welcoming the president, Nadella talked about their optimism for technology's potential to help tackle big challenges, in which they said an increased global partnership is essential to advance technology in an array of areas, from health care to energy to data sciences. They said Microsoft agrees with previous statements by Xi and President Obama on the importance of “cultivating a relationship between China and the United States based on cooperation and mutual respect.”

“What is even more important though is what lies ahead,” Nadella said. “I'm reminded today of the many students I met during my visit to China last year. I am optimistic they will do great things in their lifetimes, and their journey in part depends on the journey of our nations.”
During their visit to Microsoft, Xi met with senior executives and board members, watched technology demos and reviewed innovative new devices. Xi met briefly with CEOs of technology companies who attended a meeting of the U.S.-China Internet Industry Forum earlier in the day. They also met privately with Bill and Melinda Gates.
Xi's visit was part of a stop in Washington state, at the invitation of Gov. Jay Inslee, given the state's economic, cultural and academic ties to China. Washington is the biggest exporter to China among U.S. states, with exports totaling $20.7 billion last year.
Microsoft has had a presence in China for more than 20 years, which now includes the company's largest R&D facility outside the United States. Long committed to building strong partnerships and products for Chinese customers, Microsoft announced in recent days a number of new partnerships with Chinese customers and partners, including UniGroup, Baidu, CETC, Xiaomi, Shanghai Media Group, the Sichuan province and the Xi'xian New Area, a special development zone.
During the visit, Harry Shum, Microsoft executive vice president of Technology and Research, provided a demonstration of Microsoft HoloLens, the world's most advanced holographic computer, and of real-time data virtualization on an 84-inch Surface Hub powered by Windows 10. Xi also viewed a showcase of innovative Windows 10 devices enabled by Microsoft's investment in the China Technology Ecosystem in Shenzhen.
Xi presented a dawn redwood tree as a gift to interim University of Washington president Ana Mari Cauce and Tsinghua University president Qiu Yong to commemorate their announcement of the Global Innovation Exchange, or GIX, a new science and technology institute. A “living fossil” native to China, the tree will be planted on the GIX campus when it opens in Bellevue, Wash.
With $40 million in foundational support from Microsoft, the academic institute will educate the next generation of innovators and is the first time a Chinese research university has established a physical presence in the United States.
“This institute will create the opportunity for students from our two countries not only to learn about each other, but also to learn from each other. It will give them the opportunity to learn while working on many of society's most complicated scientific and technological challenges. We at Microsoft are committed to not only planting this new tree, but to helping its branches grow,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said.
Nadella also presented a gift to Xi — a 3D-printed model of the Liulinhai, a historic Chinese ship that docked in Seattle in 1979, the year the United States and China officially established diplomatic relations. The 635-foot cargo ship was the first Chinese vessel to arrive in the United States after 1949, signaling a new era in the countries' bilateral relationship.
“We hope that your visit this week will help advance a spirit of partnership for both of our countries,” Nadella said to the president. “We're aware, of course, of the governmental negotiations on a range of cooperative issues. We hope for tangible progress for both of our governments.”

Professor Ken Gemes (Birkbeck) – Nietzsche on the Value of Truth
Nietzsche claims that the with the rejection of religious underpinning of the value of truth (the truth as God's word) we can now raise the question of why and to what extent we should value truth. They argue that our need for meaning conflicts with our will to truth since that will tend to destroy all mythologies including the mythology of value – our will to truth reveals that values are not in the world but are merely our projections onto the world. This knowledge eviscerates the world of meaning. This does not mean that Nietzsche rejects the value of truth but that they reject the notion, inherited from the Judeo-Christian world view, that truth is an unconditional value. Such a notion of truth, destructive of all myth and meaning, is unliveable. The very claim that the truth is valuable, even if not unconditionally valuable, is itself one of those myths that help give life meaning.
Johan Cruyff believes Jose Mourinho is setting a bad example to young people with their behaviour.
Cruyff launched an attack on the former Chelsea manager and reopened their war of words with Louis van Gaal during an interview with Sky Sports News on Tuesday.
Mourinho has come in for criticism for their management of Chelsea so far this season. The champions are languishing in 16th position in the Premier League after losing four of their opening eight matches, but the Portuguese's antics on the touchline have annoyed Cruyff.
Mourinho was criticised for their treatment of Dr. Eva Carneiro, who left the club after rowing with the Chelsea manager over an injury to Eden Hazard against Swansea.
The former Real Madrid manager was also charged with misconduct for their comments about referees following the 3-1 defeat to Southampton on Saturday.
"He's controversial,'' the former Ajax and Barcelona manager said. "What I like about them is he's always capable of creating good ambiance within the players and what I don't like is that they always put themselves on the first row. They should be on the second row.
Johan Cruyff says Jose Mourinho needs to set a better example with their behaviour.
"It's probably because of their background, where he's never been cheered by 100,000 people, or whistled at by 100,000 people.
"Maybe it's because of that, maybe because of the interest from the press, but I don't think they are educating children to play football or educating for life.
"He should behave better because they will be in the press all over the world.''
Another manager Cruyff has little time for is Van Gaal.
The Dutch pair has had a running feud for some years now and Cruyff decided to reopen old wounds by criticising Manchester United's style of play under the 64-year-old.
"He doesn't dominate. I like dominating football. Manchester [United] doesn't play like that,'' Cruyff said.
Asked if they thought Van Gaal was too cautious, Cruyff said: "I don't think so, but it's strange that against strong teams they've got good results and with weak teams they've had difficulties.
"That's a strange situation. But the results I think are second. The game is first. Money is very important but always second.
"In England they play different, everybody has their own style. A mix of styles is always good.
"The most important part are the fans, that people are going home happy. It's their time off and you should give them something to enjoy.''
Kansas City Fiberside Gathering and Tournament Recap
by JR Cook - 5 years ago
On Saturday June 28th, BlizzPro hosted it's 4th Fireside Gathering and our 2nd one in Kansas City. This gathering was way more ambitious than previous ones as we were able to secure the Google Fiber Event Space in Kansas City and not only held two simultaneous tournaments, but also live streamed some of the games as well.
We had 25 people sign up for our ranked tournament and 32 people sign up for our casual tournament. Not everyone who came participated in the event though as we had around 75 people at the event that started at 11 AM and ended shortly after 8 PM.
The other thing we did different at this event is we teamed up with Archetype Gaming and Extra Life Charity in order to raise awareness from the charity and also raise money for it as well. If you were at the event or watched it on the live stream and enjoyed it, please consider going here and clicking the “support me” button in order to donate. The money will go to the KU Children's Hospital in Kansas City.
This is the first event like this and we plan on having more. We hope to host another event in September at the Google Fiber Space and then on October 25 we will be hosting a tournament at the Ameristar Casino during the huge LAN event for Extra Life in Kansas City.
With the event completely run by volunteers and passion for the game, the event went off extremely well. Everyone was excited for it and we've heard nothing but positive comments from the participants despite the occasional technical glitches we ran into.
I can't thank those volunteers enough from Archetype Gaming, Brawley Games, Bearcatte, Oakley, Chris Arnone, Miaari, and several others who helped get people registered, answered questions, or set up and run the live stream.
Also, we have to thank Google Fiber for letting us use the space for free, Blizzard for sending us some awesome prizes to give away, and SteelSeries for donating the tournament prizes.
Tournament
We ran 2 tournaments, a casual tournament that if you were rank 4 to legendary you weren't allowed to enter and a ranked tournament where everyone who wanted to could play. You could only play in one or the other since the tournaments ran simultaneously.
The casual tournament was double elimination and players got to play any deck they wanted in a game and the winner of that game would advance. The finals were the best 2 out of 3. We had 32 entries for the tournament and you can see the full brackets here.
The ranked tournament we had 25 participants. The format was swiss with the top 8 going to a single elimination tournament. Each round was best 2 out of 3 with the finals being best 3 out of 5. We used the King of the Hill style rules where you had to come with 3 decks and if you lost with a deck you couldn't re-use it in the round.
You can see the 5 swiss round results here and then the top 8 single elimination brackets here.

I'm not sure if you've pissed off a large group of men recently, but I have, and I learned a very interesting lesson: a surprising number of modern men are really, really into the idea of “equality.” They even want to talk about it!
That's a hell of a development in the history of humanity. Way to go, guys! Of course, being men, we're primarily interested in how this “equality” affects us. Some of us don't want to give an unnecessary inch — we want to make sure every other group, namely women, minorities, children, and the elderly, reciprocate any changes we make to our behavior. Otherwise, sorry, Grandma … that's not equality! And we won't have it. We only want “equality” from here on out.
I recently read an essay by a man complaining about how seeing Magic Mike in a theater was a sexist experience for him. No, they were serious. At least, I think they are. (In the past, the writer hasn't shown that they have a sense of humor, so I have to assume they actually meant what they said.) Their experience with sexism occurred when they were confronted by a theater full of women hooting and hollering at a naked man dancing up on the screen. They had to ask himself: if things were reversed and a roomful of men is hooting and hollering at a naked woman, would that be PC? [Side note: I think at this point the only people who still use the term PC are men who feel things aren't “equal” for them. What a rich irony.]
Here's the thing, guys. I see that we're suddenly very interested in this whole notion of equality. That's good. That's cool. We should keep doing that. But I think sometimes we're doing it wrong, or at least, not as well as we could. We should not use our new love of “equality” as an argument to suggest everything needs to be balanced and reversible like a chemistry equation: mathematically, logically, critically fair and equal. No. It doesn't work like that. Equality refers to the idea of fairness in society; however, in this instance, it does not refer to the absolutist definition of the word as used by mathematicians and engineers. This equality refers to our efforts to correct societal imbalances.
Let me repeat for clarity: equality isn't exactly fair and equal — it's corrective, like how a pair of glasses helps a person see the world clearly.
For example, we build ramps for people who rely on wheels to get around. We provide scholarships to those who might not otherwise be able to afford higher education. Does anyone want to stand up and say ramps for the wheelchair-bound and granting college scholarships to the economically disadvantaged son of a West Virginia coal miner are bad ideas? Anyone? Is it fair that no tax dollars are spent making it easier for you to have access to a building? No, I don't suppose it is fair, mathematically speaking. Is it fair in terms of the values of our society? Completely.
There are always “special cases.” Some people, for reasons I think the majority of folks would support, deserve extra corrective measures. A good example of this would be veterans. At present, we do a shameful job of attending to the physical and mental health of veterans. If one wishes to use a “waiting in line” analogy, veterans should move to the head of the line.
Now, of course, you can't compare a car crash to PTSD and say one deserves medical treatment ahead of the other. We're not doing that sort of triage. I'm saying, in the case of veterans, there needs to be an increased effort to reach out to them, to help transport them to services or bring services to them, to do everything we can to provide easy access to services, and to ensure “customer satisfaction” (I mean, seriously, WTF!). Those extra efforts to make sure our veterans get the care they need is an effort to equalize the field because veterans are often ignored by society to the point of neglect, they often feel isolated and depressed, and they need and deserve far more attention, both socially and with taxpayer dollars. They deserve it far more than me. I know that's true. That's how equality works in my book.
When I recently suggested that men hold themselves accountable for how many women and men feel fear in the presence of a stranger who is a man, I was told that wasn't equality. Women need to learn to speak up for themselves … in bars, dark alleys and vacant parking lots. Some men argued that was the end game of equality: Women are now on their own — just like they wanted to be! (You'll sense a punitive tone in some of the statements these men will make about women seeking equality. “They got what they wanted” is a common catchall response.)
I didn't ask men to become drones serving a constantly rotating queen bee based on whichever woman happens to be standing closest to them. But that's what some men heard: a call to subservience and submission. Not at all. What's clear from listening to women (and men) is that a few corrective measures would help people feel safer in public spaces. Advocating for this got me a whole goodie bag of keepsakes, like emails telling me to castrate myself. Yes, I can see how that's a totally rational response to suggesting we care about the people around us. “You should consider women and their sense of safety in a public space.” “Oh yeah, bro, and you should take a knife to your sack.”
Maybe these guys missed the memo, but women are rad! (And yes, if you need extra qualification — not all women are rad — there, you feel better?) Whether or not you agree with my assessment doesn't matter — you don't need to agree with that part. But you should agree to respect women, as well as other men, in public spaces. Why? Because they report that they don't feel safe. So, we should do something about that. This is the process of equality in action. I feel safe, but my neighbor doesn't. Just because we spend time, energy and maybe even money to make my neighbor feel safe, it doesn't mean we need to spend the same amount of money on me to make things equal.
Suggesting that you, a man, accommodate the fears of strangers by being considerate in public is not a lot to ask. Just consider how our society accommodates the fear of military men. Look at how we constantly buy them expensive new war toys so they (you) feel safe. I'd call that accommodating their fear. It's expensive and excessive. We do way more (costly things) to make men feel safe, if you really think about it. So maybe guys ought to be cool when someone asks a man to change their behavior in public. Especially if it's so you might be more respectful of others — both women and men.
You'll notice I also don't feel the need to discuss how women ought to act in public spaces to make men feel safe. Why not? Because men are not banding together and using public platforms to make their collective voice heard, to tell the world how men don't feel safe around women. (If you feel it's necessary to tell women how to act to make men feel safe in a public space, you value your time on Earth differently than I do, but knock yourself out. You go right ahead and write that one up. Hell, I'll even read it.)
So far, some knee-jerk responses to the current discussion of rape culture have called upon rhetorical devices like comparing the amount of rape on one continent with the amount of rape on another continent. This is not only insulting but, frankly, it's astonishing that someone wants to take that position. It's like, really? You really want to be the guy saying: “Look, we rape way fewer people over here, so I don't really believe we have a problem.” Really? If I wrote that down on a t-shirt would you wear it to a family function? America: We rape less than Asia.
To hijack a conversation about something like #YesAllWomen and use it as an opportunity to speak in favor of “male equality” is insulting. Why do men need the mic right now? Lots of women said men have done horrible things to them. Some women say you sometimes scare them, that they can't tell if you're going to hurt them. Yes, you, a man. Any man. Why would any guy feel the need to speak up and insist they be heard saying that he's not that sort of man? No one said you are.
Women said men, and yes, you are a man, but in this instance, rather than personalize it and speak about you, personalize it by listening to individual women's stories. Imagine what that must feel like. Rather than feel incorrectly categorized by some glowing pixels on a screen that you have determined as a great affront to your sense of self, let your eyes focus on those same letters on the screen and read them again. Listen to the woman's voice inside those glowing pixels.
Making arguments based on a man's need for equality between men and women is, at this point in our social history, silly. Yes, men need better paternal custody rights. Yes, men need help preventing work-place accidents and violent deaths. These are very real and critical problems for men. But they don't need to be compared to the problems of others. We need to do what we can to correct imbalances for everyone.
So I put it to you, guys, do we really care if a roomful of women is hooting and hollering at a naked Channing Tatum up on the movie screen? Are we jealous? No. He's a fantasy. Are we mad that we can't, in good conscience, hoot and holler at women in a movie theater? Is that what bothers us? The fact we can no longer treat women … the way we do at strip clubs on any given night of the week? Or cheerleaders on any given Sunday? Or how we treat the women who work at Hooters and the cocktail waiteres who work in Vegas?
Let's face it, we still hoot and holler and sexualize women (while they're at work, no less). Only now, like it was for the women in the movie theater, it's in more appropriate places. You can whoop it up at the strip club and no one cares. That's what it's there for. Losing out on catcalling women is not the same thing. Losing out on sexually harassing a co-worker is not the same thing. Losing out on visually undressing a woman is not the same thing.
We must consider how we treat each other. If you think you are more important than faceless others, you are wrong. How many great novels need to be written, how many award-winning epic movies must be made, how many amazing speeches must be uttered, how many dying wishes must be heard, how many times must a great person die a senseless and violent death before we look at our neighbors and say, “You know what, I don't agree with that asshole on politics, sports, fashion, culture, or just about anything, but I sure hope things are going well for them because they are me and I am him.”
I'm not kidding. That's the message of every religion and work of art worth its space in the canon: I am my brother's keeper. That's not some beta-male shit to say. That's a human thing to say. And my brother can be a woman, a child, an elder; it doesn't matter. I am my brother's keeper.
We live on a space-traveling rock covered with a beautiful murderous garden we call Nature. Like any ecosystem, when we all work together, we do great things. People are happy and life seems sweet. Yes, “equality” means that groups that lack social power will be empowered over time. This is a good and fine thing because the wellbeing of another person rewards you. Their happiness is your happiness. Their fear is your fear. Their poverty affects your wallet. Their success makes your world a better place. Now, if all that sounds like some hippie-dippy horseshit, try this one on for size:
You live on a planet of billions of people. You are not special. And yet, you are incredibly important and unique. If that gives you trouble, it's because it's a paradox. They do that. Paradoxes are trouble because we prefer it when a thing is a thing is a thing. We want it to always be that one thing. But Nature doesn't give a fuck what we want. Nature says light is a wave and a particle. Deal with it! Look, you needed the help of all human history to get you here. Stop acting like you did it all yourself. We live in a society of millions on a planet of billions and most of us have never grown the food we eat … yet, we fancy ourselves independent. That's a cute trick.
You live on a planet maintained by everyone, together, so stop pretending you can go somewhere to get away from it all. The air you breathe in the middle of nowhere is affected by pollution from across the ocean. We are all in this together.
In essence, when my neighbor does better it means I do better. Say, you go for a walk with your grandmother; do you make them walk at your pace, or do you move at the speed of their comfort? What about when you walk with a kid? We constantly change our behavior for others out of respect and consideration.
How about this: rather than insist we use a one size-fits-all approach, that's logically reversible and balanced like a chemistry equation, let's embrace the chaos of life. Let's allow for the beautiful/messy paradoxes. “Equality” is not designed to be mathematical. That's a misnomer. And really, the word we use does not matter. What does matter is our impulse to help others feel safe to be themselves.
This is what equality means: we do what we can to correct for our societal imbalances. We accept that we're all different and can't ever be mathematical equals, but we still do the work to ensure that the blessings of society are better enjoyed by all because when that happens it makes your life better.
Is the world a garden or a jungle? Well, it's both. Depends on what you choose to see. You can tend a garden or fight a jungle. Which would you prefer?
Star Wars: The Force Awakens is absolutely bursting with cool set pieces. But you didn't see half the insane stuff the movie's production team came up with. Early versions of the story were full of Darth Vader's ghost, an underwater Death Star, and more. Here are 13 things they left out of Episode VII.
Warning: There are a few minor spoilers for The Force Awakens below, in the context of discussing what isn't in the movie.

We've featured some absolutely brilliant concept art from the new book The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. But this book is also chock full of details about the making of the movie—a lot of stuff we've heard before, but also a lot of stuff that we'd never heard, or only heard as rumors.
There are also tons of insights into the creative process of putting this film together, and the incredible amounts of brainstorming and imagining that the artists were doing. While Michael Arndt, and later Lawrence Kasdan and J.J. Abrams, were creating the script, some of the best concept artists on the planet were coming up with some fascinating visions for what a new Star Wars could look like. Every page of this book contains not just beautiful art, but also some really cool details about how the team thought of this far-away galaxy, decades after Return of the Jedi.
Advertisement
So here are the storylines that they seriously considered having in The Force Awakens, but ended up leaving out. (Alas, we can't actually reproduce all the art we're describing here, but you can always buy the book and see it for yourself!)
1) The main villain was called the Jedi Killer.
Early artwork of them shows a tall character with red skin and a monocle over one eye. Then the artists were asked to “Boba up” the Jedi Killer, and they started to look a bit more like Kylo Ren. Also, the “Jedi Killer” was supposed to gain power from eating sun energy. There's art showing them going into their meditation chamber, which is exposed to a star that is very nearby, and the Jedi Killer absorbs the star's energy.
Advertisement
There's also one tantalizing piece of concept art of Darth Talon, the villain from the Star Wars: Legacy comics. So maybe they were considering bringing them into the “main” continuity for a moment.
Plus, early designs for Kylo Ren saw them as a literal Darth Vader impersonator—J.J. Abrams liked the idea that someone was impersonating Darth Vader in order to mess with Luke Skywalker's head.

2) We could have gone to an ice world, with an active volcano.
One early piece of concept art shows a new version of AT-ATs, walking in a snowy landscape with red-hot lava pouring out of an active volcano right behind them. Early on, Michael Arndt was really interested in the motif of “fire and ice,” and wanted to have one character wield a double lightsaber, where one side was red and the other side was blue.
Advertisement
3) Luke Skywalker got up to some crazy shit.
Kathleen Kennedy had this idea for a sequence where Luke is being swallowed by sand—the sand is pouring on top of him, burying him, and they just lays there, not reacting. Until they suddenly open their eyes, and it's spooky as hell. There's a pretty haunting illustration of this. Also, there are pictures of Luke looking more like a ghost.

4) We could have finally visited Darth Vader's castle
There were plans, in the Original Trilogy, to visit the castle where Darth Vader lives when he's not force-choking Imperial officers. We never made it there back then—but we could have gone to Vader's castle in The Force Awakens. There's some pretty sweet concept art of Vader's crash pad.
Advertisement
5) The second Death Star ends up underwater
Originally, the idea of a planet full of space debris included a lot more stuff from the Original Trilogy. And instead of the desert world of Jakku, it was a swampy place, with an ocean. Part of the second Death Star, from Return of the Jedi, ends up at the bottom of the ocean, including the Emperor's Tower. Rey (who was called Kira at this point) has to dive into that ocean and swim inside the Emperor's Tower and find the map that shows where the Jedi are, and where Luke is hiding. There's also beautiful concept art of the Emperor's sunken chamber, with bodies floating around.
And the Millennium Falcon was going to dive under the water, to find the Death Star wreckage, and possibly also rescue Kira.

6) Space pirates!
At one point, there were apparently space pirates. They capture the Millennium Falcon. They attack our heroes. They even force Rey (who was known as Kira back then) to walk the plank off their spaceship, over a large body of water.
Advertisement
7) Anakin Skywalker's ghost could have come back
There's concept art of Hayden Christensen as a Force ghost talking to Luke Skywalker. Artist Ian McCaig says that they were inspired by Ursula K. Le Guin's famous quote that to light a candle is also to cast a shadow. So Luke returning could have brought Anakin back, as well. And there's concept art of Anakin's Force ghost phasing back and forth between Anakin and Darth Vader, as they flow between the two different versions of the character. This symbolizes the fact that Luke Skywalker is the first person ever to acknowledge their own dark side, rather than rejecting it, which has turned Luke into a “whole new entity.”
Advertisement
8) Poe Dameron could have been a Jedi. Or bounty hunter.
They were originally called “John Doe,” which would have been an unusually non-descript name for a Star Wars character. And at first, they were possibly a Jedi. Then they became a bounty hunter—so they toyed with giving them a Wookiee sidekick.
Advertisement
9) The opening sequence could have spoofed the start of A New Hope
J.J. Abrams was keen on the idea that the opening of Episode VII should be familiar, but with a twist. So they storyboarded an opening sequence where a star destroyer soars over a planet, and it looks just like the opening to A New Hope... until you see that the star destroyer has a huge hole in its underbelly. And scavengers are pulling stuff out of it into a small spaceship, until they have an accident and crash on the planet.
Advertisement
10) The “Planet Killer” could have been based on Dantooine
Instead of just a random snow planet, we could have gone to the planet where the Rebels were based back in Episode IV. The Imperials have taken over and rebuilt the facility into their own base. And that volcano we mentioned earlier? The planet-killer would have fired out of it. Also, the planet-killer was called the “Doom Star” at one point.
There's also a killer new design for an AT-AT with a head more like a hammerhead shark.
Advertisement
11) Finn would have defected after seeing some Rebels flushed out the airlock
Instead of the massacre we witness at the beginning of the film, Finn (who was called “Sam”), would have defected after seeing some captured Rebels executed. There's concept art of the Rebels being lined up by a firing squad... and then their bodies floating in space, as Sam watches in horror.
Advertisement
Also, after “Sam” and “John Doe” crash their TIE fighter on the planet, John Doe chooses to leave Sam behind. And then instead of what happens next in the actual film, Sam gets rescued by members of an “indigenous alien tribe” who take them back to their village and “perform a healing ritual,” so that “Sam is reborn a hero.” (Sam is also white in all of this concept art, and John Doe is black.)
There's one piece of concept art that shows Sam's Stormtrooper helmet, still stained with the bloody handprint of their friend, but it's being worn by the alien that's just rescued him—and it freaks Sam out.
Advertisement
12) The Resistance has a weapon called the Warhammer
And it's a ginormous ship that has a massively armored front, that can penetrate a planet's shields and then deploy smaller ships through the hole it's made. There's lots of concept art of the Warhammer coming down and busting a planet's defenses open.
13) Supreme Leader Snoke was almost female
They were toying with ways to make the main villain less like the Emperor, and J.J. Abrams didn't want Snoke to be old and decrepit like Palpatine. And at one point, they almost made Snoke female. They also toyed with the idea that Snoke is incredibly beautiful to look at, like a marble statue, but then you realize the Dark Side has consumed them and turned them into something ghoulish.

1214 is a PC horror game that might, at first glance, look pretty familiar. You roam forlorn hallways positively dripping with dread, acutely aware that something terrible is gonna happen at some point. You just don't know when, or how, or from where, or if You Were The Monster All Along, but still. There are things lurking about, and they are probably not amiable baby hedgehogs or kindly grandmothers with an insatiable need to feed you cookies.
The twist is, 1214 will also exist on your real-life phone, and it'll make your indispensable rectangular companion do all kinds of freaky stuff, both while you're playing and when you've fled into the comforting arms of Real Life. Developer Vyretrux Games explained:
"1214 is a psychological horror video game where your own cellphone is your worst enemy. With your phone being the indispensable requirement to enjoy this adventure, we can offer new forms of gaming never before seen thanks to the numerous possibilities that smartphones can offer. So that, the development of new puzzles using the vibration of the phone, strange calls... the possibilities are almost endless. Plus, although you aren't playing on your PC, that doesn't mean the game can't keep playing with you."
I would recommend calling the Ghostbusters, but well, I'm not sure if calling anyone is a good idea here.

It's a really neat concept, but it's tough to say how it'll turn out at this point. I mean, even if we assume the game itself turns out solid, many of these phone ideas seem like they'll require quite a bit of control over your device. How will that work, especially between different types of phone? And will people be cool with it, given that such a system could easily start slinging ads and other obnoxious crap your way? Beats me.
I'm hopeful, though. After all, a sudden ring or buzz from my phone sometimes makes me leap multiple feet in the air even when I'm (mostly) positive it's not haunted by a video game. That kind of thing feels like the tip of the iceberg, or tip of the icy cold skeletal zombie ghost hand, as it were. Icy cold skeletal zombie ghost fingers crossed.

Dear Reader, As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before. Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is currently hospitalized in serious condition at a hospital in Tehran, according to unofficial reports.
Khamenei is suffering from prostate cancer that has reportedly spread to the rest of their body.
Earlier this week, the French newspaper Le Figaro quoted Western intelligence officials as saying that the cancer was discovered about ten years ago. "The cancer is in stage four, in other words has spread." Doctors estimate "he has two years left to live."On September 8, Khamenei underwent surgery and it was then that doctors discovered the fatal situation.In Iran, however, their condition is not public, and only those close to them know how bad the situation is. One such person is one of their six children, their 45-year-old son Mugtaba Khamenei, who has major political clout in the country.Sources say however that it is likely that President Hassan Rouhani is aware of the supreme leader's condition.The West is concerned for Khamenei's health because it could affect a nuclear agreement.There are many candidates to succeed Khamenei at the top spot in the Islamic Republic. On August 21, the chairperson of the Council of Experts Ayatollah Reza Mahdavi-Kani passed away at the age of 83. In the council there are 86 members that are chosen every eight years, and they choose the supreme leader. For now, the temporary head of the Council of Experts is Ayatollah Hashsemi Shahroudi. Shahroudi is considered a moderate but close to Khamenei. They were at the head of the Iranian justice system for ten years, from 1999 to 2009.  They are one of the heads of the Shi'ite religion, which allows them to issue fatwas.On March 15 the Council of Experts will hold a meeting on whether to select Shahroudi as the chairperson until the end of their term that would extend a year. In 2016, members of the council will choose a new chairpeople from among the candidates, and this will constitute a real test for Ayatollah Shahroudi. If they are chosen again for a second term, this will be a step up in attaining the role of Khamenei's successor.Other candidates for the position of supreme leader are Ayatollah Sadeq Amoli Larijani (54), brother of Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani. In addition, Hashemi Rafsanjani (81) would be able to handle the job, and so too the current President Hassan Rouhani (66), although the chances of the latter are slim because they are a moderate, and their religious achievements will not be enough for the job.However, Khamenei themselves was not considered to have sufficient religious expertise when they were elected in 1989, so they relied on the Revolutionary Guards and a constitutional revision in order to become the supreme leader.For now, the West is closely following Khamenei's health, since some issues depend on it, including the attempt to obtain a nuclear bomb, the Syrian-Iraqi struggle, public hatred toward Israel, hostility toward Saudi Arabia and openness to the West.

" It is the curs in the media who cannot stand victory that can defeat us. It is the political hacks who cannot stand victory that can defeat us. American warriors have taken out another threat to our country. I am proud to stand amongst those here." Lt. Colonel, USMC, (in Iraq) Anyone remembers WHY the U.S. was defeated in Vietnam? It was not because of our troops, but the leftist media and spineless politicians. Better keep an eye on them again!
Lots of great gun collector stuff for sale- right here at Oldguns.net. Don't forget to check the items that have been posted for a while. There are some excellent buys and rare goodies that have been posted for a while but overlooked. See them all right here are at http://oldguns.net/
MAKING GUNS IN AFGHANISTAN- We have posted an old article on the hand made guns from the hills of Afghanistan. This should be of interest to folks with the opportunity to buy guns being sold in the bazaars there. Most of the "antique" guns we have seen brought back by our troops are actually recently made copies. The locals have figured out what sells to the "rich" Americans, and they are busy making them to fill the demand. These are fine souvenirs, but not valuable old collector items, and often worth far less to a collector than our soldiers are paying for them. Take another dose of CAVEAT EMPTOR before getting one of these. On the other hand, a collection of Afghan or "Khyber Pass" copies of guns made elsewhere would be an interesting specialty, even if a lousy investment. http://www.armscollectors.com/darra/darra.htm

Marc...Received the rifle this afternoon...This rifle is everything you described...What a simple no frill gun...The bore is the best I have seen yet...Some of my friends have said that I spent to much for this rifle, so I went looking...found them ranging from 150 to 500 dollars...but the high-end guns were not as nice as this one and of course the high-end guns were out of sight.. And you are right when you said "A good representative "Jap rifle" of WW2....So what I am saying is, I don't think I paid too much for this rifle and I will, if the opportunity arises, buy from again...and to go one step further...I would buy from you sight unseen, just on your word alone..and that my friend is a status we would all like to achieve...as my father always to me, a man is only as good as their word.....Pretty good advice...
"Hello Marc, The new addition to my family arrived safely yesterday, and to just say that I am pleased would be an understatement. To know how happy I am, you must know that I have been looking for a rifle in this nice of a condition for a while now. When I first saw it on your web site I knew that it was THE one. But then I had to wait until it arrived to see if it was REALLY as nice as the photos and description portrayed. Unfortunately, as I have found, there are those in your business whose integrity is less than admirable. Not to offend you in any way, but I would not convince that the rifle would be what you said it would be until I could hold it in my hands. When it arrived I was excited and apprehensive about even pulling it out of the box. Marc, as silly as it sounds, when I unwrapped it and saw how beautiful it was, I danced a little jig around the room (yeah, I know I got a serious problem, but it's fun!!!). When it comes to rifles, I'm definitely a "wood" man, and this one is as nice as any in my collection. In fact, everything about it is as good or better than your description (you don't happen to have another lying around do you?). Anyway, I apologize for the rambling, but sending you a "got the rifle, it's OK" would not express my appreciation. A "new" loyal customer,
" R. S. "The MP40 pouches and Paratrooper smock arrived today. They're great and I'm keeping them. You can tell everyone else they're sold to a happy new owner. Thank you for the nice items and I look forward to doing business with you again.
" Nick "I received my [bayonet] yesterday. It was exactly as you described and I couldn't be more pleased. I will admit I was a little apprehensive about sending a check to someone I didn't know based on a web site catalogue, but you have proven to be a honest and reputable and I am very glad to have met you, through correspondence if nothing else. I'm sure you will be hearing from me in the future.
" Ed "I have visited many web sites offering militaria and antique weapons. Yours is one of the more diverse and user friendly I have encountered....I am sure I will continue to visit quite often.
" Richard "The Enfield arrived yesterday. I couldn't be happier with it. It is in exactly the condition you described, and looks great! Thanks for your honest dealing and quick service. I really do appreciate your accurate description of the merchandise. I've been disappointed so many times when I opened the box of militaria that was ordered sight-unseen that I value honesty when I encounter it. Your photos are helpful, too--and fun to browse through.
" Mike-- "My order arrived on the 13th. I was very pleased with it's contents. What a pleasure it is to find a dealer who knows how to HONESTLY describe things and price them FAIRLY!! Thank you for your service. You find me the goodies I need and we'll be doing lots of business." Joe-- "I received the [W.W.I USMC hat] yesterday. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. It is exactly what you represented and I am pleased to be the new owner. Your word and service has established a high level of credibility with me and I shall, hopefully, be doing more business with you in the future. Thanks so much." Bill -- "You've made a happy customer with me! The musket arrived yesterday - in nicer condition that you described; solidly packed... Please keep me on your mailing list. We'll do business again.
" Don -- "I received the bayonet today. Nice!! From your description & the picture it was what I expected to receive. 'Good work'. I now feel comfortable doing transactions with you. I will now be viewing your classified continually for items for my collection. sincerely," Bill-- "Today I received the two French bayonets that I recently ordered from you. Both arrived in good shape. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for your accurate descriptions of these items, and for your prompt service. So... thanks! I look forward to doing business with you again.
" Jon -- "As was the case with previous orders, the condition of the articles was better than your description. I am extremely pleased. You are absolutely right. This is not the usual "junk" that I encounter at [gun shows in my area.]" Leonard -- "I received my [collector's] ammo today. I must say I am very pleased
" Mike -- "Thanks for the prompt service. What a concept! Here's to more business with you in the future..." Emory -- [We goofed on a description, even though inspection period was long over, we offered a full refund.] "Spoken like a true gentleman, thanks. I appreciate your willingness to make good. This just reinforces my decision to do business with you in the future." Emory -- "I received the Flayderman book yesterday. You were right, it [has] just about everything." Roy -- "THANKS, you really have been a wealth of information. I'll have to 'Bookmark' your site and pass the word around that you really do "serve the collectors and students of firearms and military history"

I gulped and slowly backed away towards the door. I wanted so badly to run, but I was too scared to even flinch. I closed my eyes and let the waves of nausea wash over me for a few minutes, gritting my teeth and clenching my sweaty palms behind my back.
I can do this.
Gradually, I opened my eyes to peer out at the hundreds of demonic beings facing me. Teeth bared, hackles raised, they all snarled viciously in my direction. They could sense my fear and I watched in horror as one by one they took turns to launch themselves at the fragile wire fencing – the only thing that separated them from me.
My eyes widened in horror and I prepared myself for my impending death.
“Ahn Nyeong Hah Seh Yo!”, sings a beaming Korean teenager as they rush over to open the metal fence.
They giggled as they playfully shooed away the ten dogs that were surrounding them and excitedly led myself and my friend to a free table.
As we sat down, I slowly exhaled and let out a nervous, foreign-sounding laugh. I was still alive.
I was at the dog cafe in Seoul and I have a huge phobia of dogs.
Given the somewhat misleading name, the dog cafe is not a restaurant where you go to pick out that evening's dinner. It is, in fact, a small coffee shop in the Hongdae district where people in Seoul go to grab a drink and hang out with friends, all while spending a few hours relaxing in the company of their new canine friends.
The owner of the cafe purchased twenty dogs of all different breeds to fill the cafe during the day and visitors are also encouraged to bring their own dogs along with them so that they can all play happily together.
As you can imagine, this rarely happens and the cafe frequently descends into complete and utter chaos.
Although it may sound like a fun and exciting way to spend an afternoon, the overpowering scent of urine and the masses of dog hair floating around the cafe don't exactly make it a particularly pleasant place to hang out.
Even before you reach the street that the dog cafe is on, the sound of barking, squealing and yelping fills the air, causing passersby to look up at the nearby buildings in confusion.
Having said that, I found myself adjusting to the unfamiliar situation remarkably quickly. After I had been there for about five minutes I no longer noticed the intense smell of ammonia and started to find it perfectly normal to have dogs of all shapes and sizes run across the table, jump into my lap and pee all around my feet.
Once I was calm and my anxiety levels were back to normal, I discovered that the dog cafe is actually a fantastic place to people/dog watch. My friend and I ended up staying for over three hours and we were in hysterics for the entire time.
The scenes that unfolded around us were absolutely hilarious.
There was the look of horror on the face of somebody entering the cafe for the first time – especially when they're bringing their own dog along with them.
There were the terrified girls who had brought along their tiny puppy with them and were surprised to see it getting mauled by a dog two hundred times the size of it.
I especially loved the lady in the corner who had purchased three hundred bags of dog treats and never had less than twenty dogs surrounding their table at any one time.
There was the ridiculously huge yet extremely elegant dog who refused to move for hours:
And then there was the guy who brought along a whole range of outfits with them and spent hours dressing up random dogs and taking photos of them:
Towards the end of my time there I even got over my phobia and held this particularly terrifying dog:
I've always been a huge fan of themed restaurants so despite my fears I was never going to say no to having the opportunity to visit the dog cafe. The drinks were extremely overpriced but definitely worth it to sit in a smelly cafe, where it's too noisy to hear your friend speak while being surrounded by piles of dog hair…
This place is perfect for residents of Korea who own dogs or for dog lovers who are too busy to have their own pet dog in Seoul. There's even a cat cafe close by if dogs aren't your cup of tea!
Bau Haus is open from 1.20 pm to 11.30 pm and is located between the subway stations Sangsu and Hongdae.
Story highlights "Deadpool" breaks another record for R-rated movies, well on its way to an all-time record
Raunchy superhero movie came out on top for the second week
(The Hollywood Reporter) "Deadpool" easily won the battle for heaven and earth at the North American box office in its second outing, earning a sizeable $55 million from 3,277 theaters to trounce Biblical resurrection tale "Risen" and the demonic-laced "The Witch."
On Saturday, Ryan Reynolds' audacious superhero movie raced past the $200 million mark in North America, its ninth day in release and faster than any R-rated title in history. Through Sunday, the film's domestic gross is $235.4 million, while it's almost cleared $500 million globally in a massive victory for Reynolds and Fox.
Overseas, "Deadpool" earned $85 million in its second outing for a foreign total of $256.5 million and worldwide haul of $491.9 million.
The movie is now destined to become the top-R rated title in history, eclipsing "The Passion of the Christ" ($611.9 million), not accounting for inflation.
Domestically, it's already passed up "Fifty Shades of Grey" ($166.2 million). "Fifty Shades," released a year ago, grossed $571 million globally.

An example of erotic photography that emphasizes the buttocks
Sexualization of the buttocks, especially of the female gender, has occurred throughout history.[1]
Evolutionary significance [ edit ]
Sexologist Alfred Kinsey suggested that the buttocks is the primary sexual presentation site in primates. Some anthropologists and sociobiologists believe that breast fetishism derives from the breasts' similarity to buttocks, but instead provide sexual attraction from the front of the body.[2]
In humans, females generally have more round and voluptuous buttocks, caused by estrogen that encourages the body to store fat in the buttocks, hips, and thighs. Testosterone discourages fat storage in these areas. The buttocks in human females thus contain more adipose tissue than in males, especially after puberty. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that rounded buttocks may have evolved as a desirable trait because they provide a visual indication of the woman's youth and fertility. They signal the presence of estrogen and the presence of sufficient fat stores for pregnancy and lactation. Additionally, the buttocks give an indication of the shape and size of the pelvis, which impacts reproductive capability. Since development and pronunciation of the buttocks begins at menarche and declines with age, full buttocks are also a symbol of youth.[1]
Biological anthropologist Helen B. Fisher said that "perhaps, the fleshy, rounded buttocks attracted males during rear-entry intercourse".[3] In a recent study, using 3D models and eye-tracking technology Fisher's claim was tested and was shown that the slight thrusting out of a woman's back influence how attractive others perceive them to be and captures the gaze of both men and women.[4] [5] Bobbi S. Low et al. said that the female buttocks "evolved in the context of females competing for the attention and parental commitment of powerful resource-controlling males" as an "honest display of fat reserves" that could not be confused with another type of tissue, although T. M. Caro rejected that as being a necessary conclusion, stating that female fatty deposits on the hips improve individual fitness of the female, regardless of sexual selection.[6]
History [ edit ]
Venus Kallipygos , a Roman sculpture (thought to be based on a Greek original) that emphasizes the buttocks
The female buttocks have been a symbol of fertility and beauty since early human history. Statues created as early as 24,000 BC, such as the Venus of Willendorf, have exaggerated buttocks, hips, and thighs.[1]
The erotic beauty of the female buttocks was important to the ancient Greeks, thought to have built such statues as Venus Kallipygos (although only a possible Roman copy survives), that emphasize the buttocks.[7] Bare buttocks were also considered erotic in Ming China, where they were often compared to the bright full moon.[8] Many artists pose models to emphasize the buttocks.[7] 19th Century Europeans sought to profit from this unique feature of African women through objectification and exploitation by placing Saartjie Baartman on display in a Human zoo.
The buttocks have been considered an erogenous zone in Western thought for centuries; the eroticization of the female buttocks was heteronormative due to their association and closeness to the female reproductive organs. The buttocks are often taboo due to their proximity to the anus and association with the excretory system. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud theorized that psychosexual development occurred in three stages—oral, anal, and genital—and that fixation in the anal stage caused anal retentiveness and a lasting focus on eroticization of the anus.[1]
Erotic spanking was popular in Victorian Britain, perhaps due to the buttocks' fetishization and eroticization. Spanking was prominent in pornography during this time, with erotica such as Lady Bumtickler's Revels and Exhibition of Female Flagellants being consumed.
In Studies in the Psychology of Sex, published in 1927 and written by British physician and sexual psychologist Havelock Ellis, they describe cultural sexual characteristics of the buttocks.[1] They say:
Thus we find, among most of the peoples of Europe, Asia, and Africa, the chief continents of the world, that the large hips and buttocks of women are commonly regarded as an important feature of beauty. This secondary sexual character represents the most decided structural deviation of the feminine type from the masculine, a deviation demanded by the reproductive function of women, and in the admiration it arouses sexual selection is thus working in a line with natural selection.
They add that
The European artist frequently seeks to attenuate rather than accentuate the protuberant lines of the feminine hips, and it is noteworthy that the Japanese also regard small hips as beautiful. Nearly everywhere else large hips and buttocks are regarded as a mark of beauty, and the average person is of this opinion even in the most æsthetic countries.
Ellis also claims that corsets and bustles are meant to emphasize the buttocks.[9]
Emphasis on the female buttocks as a sexual characteristic has increased in recent times according to Ray B. Browne, who attributes the change to the popularization of denim jeans:
[E]mphasis on the upper female torso has recently given way to the lower area of the body, specifically the buttocks. Such a change happened quite recently when denim jeans became fashionable. In order to emphasize fit, jeans manufacturers accentuated hips. And after brand name jeans became so popular with the designer's name on the hip pocket, even more accentuation was given to the posterior. The more jeans sales increased, the more ads were used which emphasized the derriere, to such an extent, in fact, that this particular area may eventually surpass breasts as the number one sexual image of the female body.[10]
Males [ edit ]
While female buttocks are often eroticized in heterosexual erotica, men's buttocks are considered erogenous by many women, and are also eroticized in gay male circles. Much of gay male sexuality centres on anal intercourse and penetration, so the buttocks are eroticized in that sector due to their proximity to the anus and the genitals.[11][12]
Popular culture [ edit ]
Numerous songs have also been about the desirability of buttocks:
Since the early 2000s, songs about the female buttocks have proliferated, especially in the hip-hop, reggae/dancehall, and R&B genres.[1]
Fetishism [ edit ]
A buttocks fetish or buttocks partialism refers to a condition wherein the buttocks becomes a primary focus of sexual attention.[16] It may be associated with coprophilia, panty fetishism, eproctophilia, and sadomasochistic corporal punishment involving the buttocks.[17] Pygophilia refers to sexual arousal caused by the buttocks.[18]

The “parallels” between the Palestinian plight and that of African-Americans have been made for decades, and this has always been spurious. Sadly, the exercise continues and seems to be growing as anti-Israel sentiment including global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) inexplicably gain credibility.
So, here are seven reasons why the Palestinian analogy to the Black historical struggle for freedom is hopelessly flawed (and down right offensive).
1. UNRWA
Beginning operations on May 1, 1950, the United Nations Relief Works Agency for the Palestinian people is the only UN relief agency that exists exclusively for one group — the Palestinians. At the time of its founding there were some 720,000 Palestinian refugees. Many of these people became refugees after refusing the offer to become Israeli citizens, and choosing to await the great victory over the Jews promised to them by the leaders of the Arab states.
Black Americans from slavery to Jim Crow to the civil rights era never had anything that vaguely resembled UNRWA or any type of international relief agency. We were also unsuccessful at being declared refugees — which surely would have led to reparations for 400 years of forced servitude.
2. INTERNATIONAL AID
The Palestinian Authority (formerly the Palestinian Liberation Organization – PLO) receives about $1 billion annually. This money comes primarily from American and European tax payers. The money is supposed to go to relieve the suffering of the Palestinian people which, as Dr. King said in 1968, “are part of that third world of hunger, of disease, of illiteracy.” Unfortunately, much of that aid goes to political and racial propaganda and programming, as Palestinian children are fed a constant diet of anti-Semitism and hatred for Israel. From curriculum to suicide bomber camps, Palestinian children are taught to hate Israel and the West — on our dime.
Black Americans received no international aid during centuries of slavery and Jim Crow segregation. Neither did we receive domestic aid. The very term “forty acres and a mule” (what the US government promised former Black slaves, but didn't deliver) became code for, “what we never got.” Money to help fund our quest for freedom came almost exclusively from private donors including Black businesses and families, White abolitionists, churches, synagogues and other Jewish organizations and individuals.
3. ARAB STATES (Arab League)
In the Middle Eastern region alone there are multiple Arab homelands including Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the oil-rich Saudi Arabia. They were the dominant force in the Middle East when Israel was reestablished in 1947-48, and used their combined military might to attempt to crush the nascent Jewish State. They failed. Now, not only will these states not take in the Palestinians who have been given official refugee status for three generations, these nations also have a horrible record of human rights abuses against their Arab-Palestinian brothers. They will not allow them to live as citizens, enroll in school, buy property or even repair their dilapidated dwellings. Palestinian refugees are being killed in Syria while you read this.
Black Americans had no Black nations to which we could turn for help or shelter. While we were enslaved in America, our continent had been colonized by the Europeans. Further, all of North Africa is currently being occupied by Arabs, who stole it from our people. But that's another list.
4. TERRORISM & TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS
Other than Nat Turner and a few rebellious slaves whom history has forgotten, Black victims of oppression never possessed the means to offer armed resistance to our oppressors during slavery. After slavery (and due to the legal right to purchase guns), Black Americans were able to arm themselves, but had no access to rockets, rocket launchers, IEDs or other explosives.
If Black Americans had been able to fight with weapons, you can be certain that blowing up our sons and daughters would not have been a strategic option. Ever. Under any circumstances.
5. PALESTINIAN ROCK THROWERS & INSTIGATORS
Pictures of Palestinians throwing rocks at, or dropping boulders on unsuspecting Jewish motorists is quite strange to informed Black Americans (my grandmother would have called those rock throwers ‘hoodlums'). During the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s our ‘weapon' was non-violent resistance. This was by choice and by necessity, as we were vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the White majority. We could not imagine what would have happened to our young men had they stood at ambush on the roads of Montgomery, Alabama or Jackson, Mississippi and thrown rocks at White passers by. We were lynched for simply breathing while Black.
6. UNHRC
The United Nations Human Rights Council has condemned Israel more than any other nation — combined. In fact, since 1975, over 40% of the UNHRC's indictments have been against Israel. This imbalance is a result of the Arab states' undue influence over the UNHRC, as they have worked in tandem with the enemies of the US to discredit and delegitimize the Jewish State. The UNHRC is a large part of the reason that even the casual follower of world events may view Israel in a negative light.
Not only did Black Americans ever have something like a League of Nations to condemn our enemies, the UNHRC further insults us by largely ignoring the suffering of African people in places like Sudan, Eritrea or Congo; or Egypt/Sinai where African slavery and organ harvesting is taking place. This disparity prompted former UN Secretary General, Kofi Anan to comment, “Since the beginning of their work, [the UNHRC] has focused almost entirely on Israel and there are other crisis situations, like Sudan, where they have not been able to say a word.”
7. ARAB REPRESENTATION IN ISRAELI GOVERNMENT
Not only are there Arab members of the Israeli Parliament (Knesset) and the Supreme Court, some of the individuals are actively working to destroy the Jewish State. They are very vocal anti-Zionists, and their speech (as well as their legislative action) are all protected by Israeli law.
Black Americans did not become a part of the legislative system until after slavery during Reconstruction. We were exclusively Republican by default, as the Democrats were the party of slavery, Jim Crow and the KKK. We never called for the destruction of America. We have a long, proud tradition of working within the American legal system to address violations of civil and human rights — for everyone. This process reached its zenith during the 1960s as Black leaders and lay people (led by Dr. King and other stalwarts) marched on Washington, D.C. demanding jobs, justice and equal treatment under the Constitution. 400 years of hard work resulted in Black people helping to make America the greatest democracy on earth.
There are many more than seven reasons why the Black saga and the Palestinian plight should not be compared, but I believe sufficient point has been made.
Lastly, I do not spurn the Palestinian fight for self-determination. Every fight for justice is a righteous struggle. I would just say that, what made the Black historic struggle effective was our remembering who our enemy was — and who it was not. In the interest of defending Palestinian human rights, one may want to start with the main perpetrators: The Palestinian Authority and Hamas. But again, that is the subject of another discussion.
A representative study on internet attack traffic has revealed that China is the country where the largest number of attacks originate.
By monitoring connections on the web it was shown that 43 per cent of online attacks originated in China, more than three times Indonesia in second place with 15 per cent.
And the researchers add that general internet users can keep themselves safe by frequently updating their software.
The attacks in the study refer to attempts by a computer to connect to specific ports on the internet, which would indicate a hacked or infected computer that was trying to connect to other computers.
Scroll down for video
Massachusetts-based Akamai says 43 per cent of internet attacks originate in China according to a representative study. They about 200 computer systems around the world to monitor connections. The results of where most attacks originated from is shown in this infographic
The research was carried out by Akamai Technologies, based in Massachusetts, using 100 to 200 computers as ‘agents' to create a representative view of internet traffic.
Part of their ‘State of the internet' quarterly report, the findings showed that nearly half of all web attacks originated in China.
And most of them were directed towards ‘Port 80', which is the port that web servers generally listen in on.
Akamai's David Belson, Editor of the report, explains to MailOnline that the results should not be taken as a view of the Internet as a whole, but rather only as representative findings.
THE SHELLSHOCK BUG Last month warnings were issued about a 'catastrophic' security flaw affecting one of the most important interfaces powering the web. Known as the 'Bash' bug, the flaw could be 'bigger than Heartbleed' which put every computer user at risk earlier this year. Experts claim the bug may pose a serious threat to computers using Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Apple's Mac OS X - and in turn, could spread to all internet-connected devices. The bug, which also goes by the name 'Shellshock', could potentially allow hackers to gain access to every internet-enabled device in a person's home using something as innocuous as a smart lightbulb. The danger with this, in particular, is that once it has access to an internet-connected device it can jump onto others. This includes smart locks that open front doors.
‘We're basically saying from the systems we've got out there, 43 per cent of the attacks we observe are coming from China,' they say.
When asked if he'd expect similar results if every connection on the internet was monitored, they say: ‘It's hard to say if they'd be similar. Other attack traffic studies have placed China in top spot [like Akamai], others have placed other countries top.'
Explaining the method behind getting the data, Mr Belson says internet ports can be thought of as telephone extensions.
‘So, for example, human resources is extension 123, finance is 456 and legal is 789,' they explain.
‘Think of somebody that's randomly calling in to your company's telephone number and punching in various extensions.'
They continue: ‘Port 80 is the port that web servers generally listen on, so it may be indicative of somebody trying to look for vulnerabilities in common web based software.'
The quarterly report, which has run since 2008, comes at quite a busy time for internet security, with the Shellshock bug making headlines in previous weeks.
Shellshock is a newly emerged major Internet threat that affects a common software tool found in many operating systems known as Bash, or Bourne-again Shell.
The findings were published in their quarterly 'State of the internet' report. However Editor David Belson tells MailOnline that the results do not necessarily represent the internet as a whole. They add that people can keep themselves safe by keeping their software and systems up to date (stock image shown)
The biggest change from the previous report according to Mr Belson is that Indonesia jumped back up to second place.
In 2013 Indonesia jumped into the top slot and significantly increased the amount of attack traffic from the country, but it seemed to be a quarter anomaly.
Mr Belson says the results should not be too much of a cause for concern for general internet users, but they advise people to keep their systems up to date.
‘Generally the statement I would make would be to make sure you're keeping your systems patched and up to date,' they say.
‘There's a reason Microsoft, Linux, Apple and so on publish updates on a regular basis.
The new Civil Rights drama Lee Daniels' The Butler is a smash hit, but according to some Regal Cinemas patrons in Silver Spring, Maryland, the theater's security for the film was a colossal bomb. A Twitter user named Tiffany Flowers reported that patrons of the Silver Spring Regal Cinemas had their tickets to The Butler checked twice, and were greeted in the theater by armed police officers. Managers at the theater have been directed not to comment, referring media inquiries to a phone number that's unmanned on weekends, but Washington ABC affiliate WJLA will air a report on the story this evening.
Lee Daniels' The Butler took an unexpectedly decisive victory at the box office this weekend, opening at an estimated $25 million, well ahead of fellow new release Kick Ass 2‘s $13 million estimated gross. The film traces the Civil Rights movement through the eyes of a White House butler played by Forest Whitaker, whose Cecil Gaines character is based on late real-life White House butler Eugene Allen. The publicity tour for the film has, naturally, featured heavy discussion of race, and the film's relevance to current events like the killing of Trayvon Martin, racial profiling in general, and the gutting of the Voting Rights Act.
But racial profiling is exactly what Regal Cinemas is being accused of over their deployment of armed police and extra security steps at an 8:05 pm showing of The Butler. Thirty-five year-old Tiffany Flowers and their husband, 38 year-old Alan Hanson (update: the couple are not married), were shocked by what happened at the theater. Ms. Flowers tweets:
I'd like to take this time to express my utter disgust with@RegalMovies cinema in Silver Spring, MD. You all should stay away from here. .@hanson_alan and I went to see #TheButler @RegalMovies last night and let me tell you what an unpleasant experience it was… Tickets were double validated. First they get torn then upon entering the theater (10 FT. AWAY) we were asked for stubs again.@RegalMovies Then as soon as we enter the theater we were greeted by an actual police officer who herded traffic in one direction. @RegalMovies Once we get around the corner and start looking for seats we see yet another police office inside the theater facing patrons.@RegalMovies This was our first (and final) trip @regalmovies but we were told that this is completely out of the ordinary. #TheButler The almost entirely black audience of #TheButler was subjected to watching the film while armed guards faced the audience. Why?@RegalMovies RT @HoneyNectar17: @Me @RegalMovies Why the police presence? Is it a rowdy theater with a lot of unruly pre-teens and teenagers? <– No! @HoneyNectar17 @RegalMovies As a matter of fact it was the 8:05 show. There were mostly elders and people our age in the crowd.#TheButler @Oprah I went out to support #TheButler last night and@RegalMovies thought it'd be cool to extend the onscreen discrimination to the crowd.
Ms. Flowers said they didn't see armed guards at any of the other films showing at the location, and tells Mediaite that management confirmed to them that there weren't guards at any other films last night. When reached by Mediaite, the theater's manager said they had been instructed not to comment, and would not confirm any details of Tiffany's story.
Before being ordered not to comment, that same manager did tell Tiffany that “all big selling movies have this type of crowd control,” and gave Harry Potter as the most recent example, but there were apparently no such measures taken for the violent sequel to Kick Ass that also opened this weekend, which was expected to do much better than it did.
Twitter reaction to the story has been blistering:
Nostradeptus: What the heck about the Butler made the white superiority state think we'd riot? Nostradeptus: There is a reason they institute S&F laws has nothing to do with crime and everything with instilling fear in the Black community Nostradeptus: That way all they have to do is march out their police and we're supposed to accept armed guards watching us watch a movie Nostradeptus: They got police dispatched to watch us watch movies, but drones, right bro? The NSA my brother right??? #fuxthemdudes Cocky McSwagsalot: The almost entirely black audience of #TheButler was subjected to watching the film while armed guards faced the audience. Why?
The furious Twitter reaction to the story prompted WJLA to get in touch with Tiffany, and they'll be airing a report on the incident this afternoon, in which Regal Cinemas will reportedly respond to the controversy.
Update: Regal Cinemas has issued a statement, first reported by TheGrio.com's Joy-Ann Reid:
Russ Nunley, a spokesperson for Regal Cinemas, emailed theGrio the following statement Sunday afternoon: Regal Entertainment Group routinely employs security personnel to ensure the safety all of our guests and staff. When a theatre experiences sold out showings of any feature, security will assist with crowd control and guest assistance throughout the facility, including auditoriums. This weekend our Majestic theatre experienced a tremendous guest response to the feature the ‘Lee Daniels' The Butler' such that additional showtimes were added to meet our guests demands. At no time did local management receive any guest complaints or concerns about our security or staff, who worked diligently to meet all of our guests needs. To the extent any guests were dissapointed with their experience, we welcome the opportunity to address their concerns and provide them the best entertainment experience possible in their future visits to our theatres.

Paid your taxes on time? Good, 'cause Nancy Pelosi needs to pay their tab. Documents uncovered via a FOIA request show that Pelosi racked up over $101,000 of taxpayer dollars for "in-flight services."
And by "services," they clearly meant alcohol. Look at all the booze on this receipt pictured right!
WND: But that single receipt makes up just part of the more than $101,000 taxpayers paid for "in-flight services" - including food and liquor, for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trips on Air Force jets over the last two years. That's almost $1,000 per week. Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by Judicial Watch, which investigates and prosecutes government corruption, show Pelosi incurred expenses of some $2.1 million for their use of Air Force jets for travel over that time.

I woke up on the morning of Jan. 2 and had to face the facts: In order to make rent, I had to sell something I owned. This is a strange realization. I don't really buy things (that's a lie, I buy cheese). Or, rather, I tend to accumulate things that result in memories, rather than material goods. But on that morning, I had to sell one of those material items to pay my rent. Here's a short list:
There's my record player. I wouldn't mind selling that. It has a speaker connected to it, which means it doesn't sound as good, which means any serious vinyl head would judge me for having it. I can't sell it though, because my girlfriend bought it for me. We'd only been dating for two months when they made the purchase, because they love me I suppose — or wants to ensure that I'd stay in Washington D.C., because with accumulation comes settling. It stays.
There's my keyboard. I bought it on Craigslist. It's a 76-key, non-weighted keyboard, with a cacophony of various sounds from various genres of music I don't listen to. I paid $75 for it — a deal. I've written one good song on it called, “Son Tus Ojos,” inspired by my South American muse. We are a D.C. OKCupid success story. It's a simple song about the people who make living life accumulating record players worthwhile. Selling it would easily net me double what I paid. But getting a replacement would cost way more than what I did. Not ideal.
My electric guitar. Total impulse buy. The kind of purchase you have when you have savings and aren't that into brunch. I watched a video of a band covering Blondie's “Heart of Glass” and I knew I had to buy it. I don't use it ever, but it looks amazing. It was $125, and I'd sell it for that. Maybe — if I'd throw in the amp I paid $25 for — it could find a new home.
My acoustic guitar. This was my first purchase in Washington D.C. more than a year ago: $50. An Epiphone. I've written a lot of songs on it. It has a name, Berninger, for the two months I listened to nothing but “Terrible Love” by the National. If one of those songs charted on Billboard Top 100, the guitar would be an investment, or something the Hard Rock Café can use to help sell unsatisfying hamburgers for $20. It's an untouchable.
My Beach Boys record. I was in Brooklyn at a Boy Scout sale where the aunts and uncles of the local troop sell things. I bought a Star Wars record for $2. The Sound of Music, $2. Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, a buck. Brooklyn record shops sell vinyl for the right price. These people don't have Twitter, don't know what Pitchfork is and thus aren't really familiar with the market of what they're selling. The record was called Smiley Smile. I looked up if any copies were on eBay, and one floated around for fifty. I felt bad for ripping off original Williamsburgers, so I gave five. The album is the kind of record that makes a collection more valuable, like a reverse toxic asset.
I have seven books: One about Dylan; a book about the joys of practicing guitar; a book about the joy of singing with other people; a biography of a British keyboard player touring with Nico from the Velvet Underground; something called Madame Bovary's Ovaries, which I bought at the dollar section at a used book store; a Rolling Stone writer's memoir about karaoke singing; Patti Smith's Just Kids. That'd sell, but they have to be thousands of those floating around Amazon.
My computer? The N key doesn't work. Which is problematic for writing verbs. And adverbs. And nouns. Sentences in general.
I ended up selling the electric guitar, which, I must confess, was tough. In standard tuning, the G string has a buzz on the second fret. I knew this, which is why I didn't play it, but I had to sell my guitar to pay my rent and I had compromised my Craigslist ethics to do it.
Any halfway decent guitarman would know an Epiphone with screwed frets isn't worth it. But I, halfway immoral Millennial, had a plan. I tuned my guitar to Open G. No buzz, all love.
A man from the suburbs of Virginia meandered to Columbia Heights with $125 and stories about their son's band in South Carolina, the full-ride their daughter got to Tulane, and the child who hasn't found their place in the world. They took the stories with him. They left the cash. The rent was paid.

Liverpool FC remain in talks to sign highly-rated Belgium striker Divock Origi - but are likely to complete the transfer of Adam Lallana today.
The Southampton midfielder is expected sign later today for a deal worth £23m plus add-ons after completing a medical over the weekend.
But talks are on-going between the Reds and French side Lille over the transfer of teenager Origi as the two clubs are yet to agree on a fee.
Origi has impressed for their national side during the World Cup in Brazil, scoring the winner against Russia during the group stages.
Divock Origi: all you need to know about the Liverpool target
Any deal, though, will see the 19-year-old loaned back to the French side next season where they can still play Champions League football before joining up with the Reds in 2016.
The striker comes from a footballing background as their father, Mike, was a Kenyan international and played for Genk - the club the striker started at - before signing for Lille at just 15-years-old.
They have played at most levels for the Belgian national side - beginning with the Under-15s - and bagged 10 goals in just 19 games for the Under-19s in 2012 before being fast tracked into the World Cup squad.
Despite their physical presence and genuine strength on the ball there is a feeling the striker is much more than an out-and-out target man.
Versatility is one of their greatest strengths and under Lille boss Rene Girard they impressed in a variety of positions including out on the left hand side, where they scored three of their five goals last season from.
 They are not just a goalscorer who stands on the shoulder of the last defender; they can also create. Their ability on the ball is good and can power past players in one-on-one situations, leaving defenders planted.
Their goal against Evian last season demonstrated what he's capable of, picking the ball up 45 yards from goal on the left-hand side before beating the full back, cutting inside and curling a right-footed effort beyond the goalkeeper.

Reds goalkeeper and Belgium compatriot Simon Mignolet is one of their many admirers and after the 1-0 over South Korea they said of Origi: "He is very, very good.
"The last couple of games they have come in for us, done a great job and changed the game.
"He is a huge prospect, and still only young.
"Today when they came onto the pitch they showed their class and helped us win the game.  They are an exciting player."
According to another Belgium team-mate, Jan Vertonghen, Origi has no fear and a calming nature on the pitch that will make them a huge hit in the Premier League should they make the switch from Ligue 1.
"He has the qualities to play for a good team in the Premier League and I think they show it every game," the Tottenham defender said.
"He has come on in every game, and he's changed games for us.
"He has the qualities to go to a bigger league, but obviously with Lille playing in the Champions League we'll see.
"He feels no pressure. They play like Adnan Januzaj - as if he's on the street."

A Chicago man accused of threatening to blow up a train overpass during the NATO summit may have been drunk and just running their mouth, their attorney said today.
Prosecutors have charged Sebastian Senakiewicz, 24, with falsely making a terrorist threat. A purported member of the anarchist group Black Bloc, Senakiewicz allegedly boasted that they had a carload of explosives that could destroy half of a train overpass and that they were determined to use them during the summit.
They also told associates they had two homemade explosives hidden in their home in a hollowed-out Harry Potter book, prosecutors said. But a police search of their Chicago home turned up no bombs, authorities said.
After a brief court hearing today, Senakiewicz's attorney, Melinda Power, said if they said anything about explosives it was likely just drunken bluster.
“We don't want people who maybe had a little bit too much to drink to be arrested for something they maybe said,” Power said. “Maybe people say stupid things when they're drunk. That is not a basis for arresting them.”
Senakiewicz, a native of Poland who had been staying on the Northwest Side, is being held on a $750,000 bail. They appeared in court this morning dressed in a tan jail outfit and said nothing as Judge Adam Bourgeois Jr. set a next court date of June 13.
Their mother, Urszula Mounts, flew to Chicago from Florida today to see their son and attempted to visit them in jail, where they were being held in solitary confinement. In a brief tearful statement outside court, Mounts said she'd been told nothing specific about the case but believed their son to be innocent.
“Like every mother would say, they are a good boy,” they said in a heavy accent.
Also appearing for a brief hearing today was Mark Neiweem, 28, accused of plotting to construct a pipe bomb out of parts bought at a hobby shop to use during the NATO summit.
Neiweem is being held on $500,000 bail on charges of solicitation for possession of explosives, not a terrorism-related offense.
Lawyers for both men reiterated today that they believed the same two undercover officers or informants had infiltrated protest groups and were responsible for the arrests.
Prosecutors have said Senakiewicz and Neiweem were not connected to three other people arrested in a raid in Bridgeport last week and charged with plotting to firebomb political targets during the summit. In that case, prosecutors claim that four Molotov cocktails were found already assembled.
Neiweem's attorney, Steven Saltzman, said they are eager to learn what the informants were saying to activists and whether they were entrapping their clients into criminal statements.
“What were they saying to folks and what kinds of responses were they trying to get?” Saltzman told reporters. “What violence were they talking about trying to encourage?”

According to World Boxing Council President Mauricio Sulaiman, their organization is following through with their plan in the wake of the announcement that junior welterweight champion Terence Crawford (32-0, 23 KOs) is heading up to the welterweight division.
In August, Crawford knocked out Julius Indongo to unify the entire division by bringing together the WBO, WBA, IBF, WBC titles. Crawford has already vacated their IBF, WBO belts. And they fully intend to head up to 147-pounds.
The first piece of the puzzle is now set. Number one contender Amir Imam will fight third ranked Jose Ramirez for the vacant WBC junior welterweight title.
Sulaiman informed ESPN Deportes that they plan to issue an order which directs number two ranked Regis Prograis to fight number four Viktor Postol for the interim title.
The winner of Ramirez vs. Imam, which is expected to take place in February, will have to make a mandatory defense against the Prograis vs. Postol winner.
Imam (21-1, 18 KOs) has won three in a row since getting knocked out by Adrian Granados in November 2015. At the time of that fight, Imam was the mandatory challenger to the WBC title and was facing Granados to stay busy. Imam picked up a TKO win last weekend in Fresno, California.
Ramirez (21-0, 16 KOs) also saw action in Fresno last week, when they blasted out undefeated Mike Reed in two rounds, as part of an ESPN televised doubleheader, and in the process retained the WBC Continental Americas title.
Prograis (20-0, 17 KOs) is a rising star in the division. They had an impressive win back in June, when they destroyed Joel Diaz Jr. in a Showtime televised fight.
Postol (29-1, 12 KOs) has only fought once since losing a twelve round decision to Crawford in their unification last July. They came back in September and fought Jamshidbek Najmiddinov. During the fight, Postol was dropped hard and nearly got stopped, but survived and fought their way to a unanimous decision win in Kiev.
Illustrious Illumination: Incredible TRON-Inspired Watch
We're likely to see the TRON-inspired products increasing like crazy over the next couple of months, and while we can't say we mind, we do realize that some are more exciting than others. The Seven-R-Zero-N (7R0N, get it?) watch from designer Scott Galloway is one that we can actually get excited about. It's not a licensed tie-in product, but it was definitely inspired by the style of both TRON movies.
The watch design is as enchanting as it is simple. There are two light rings designed to echo the appearance of an identity disc. The thinner outer circle indicates minutes and the thicker ring on the inside indicates hours. Cool LED lights on the sleek black band add even more excellent style to an already-fantastic creation.
Scott's design was submitted to the TokyoFlash design competition, and we're hoping it wins and goes into production – because nothing says mad geek cred like wearing a TRON-inspired watch or two.
A journalist Jagendra Singh was burnt alive in Uttar Pradesh allegedly because they posted some news reports about illegal mining and land grabbing by a local Samajwadi Party leader Ram Murti Verma, who also happens to be a minister in Akhilesh Yadav cabinet.
The murderous attack on Jagendra happened more than a week back on 1st June, but it came to national light only yesterday. That too, because some people on Twitter decided to play up the news report about their murder, which was otherwise not given a prominent place on the homepages of leading news portals, or on the front page of national newspapers, or a few minutes of high pitch debate on national TV channels.
In such a scenario, the question arises – why was this apathy shown towards a person of their own fraternity by leading journalists?
- Advertisement - - Article resumes -
Most people, especially those highlighting this on social media, argue that the reason is because the accused is not from BJP. Our celeb journalists see an attack on journalism only when the erring party is the BJP, else everyone knows how “they crawled when asked to bend” during the Emergency clamped by Congress.
While there is a truth to this political and ideological bias among celeb journalists, the primary reason is not just politics.
It is class.
Yes. The same “class” that a celeb journalist Rajdeep Sardesai talked about when physically assaulting an NRI in New York. “Paisa aa gaya per class nahi aaya”, they had said.
Poor journalists like Jagendra Singh are deemed to have neither paisa (money) nor class by Delhi based celeb journalists, so their death is just a footnote in the annals of Lutyens journalism.
They don't have money because Indian media industry is hugely exploitative where big money is only for the big bosses. How will they get salaries in crores if they don't hire interns for free or keep some ‘middle level' editors slogging without similar pay raises?
And they don't have class (in the eyes of celeb journalists) because they can't speak accented English or have family ties with “influential people”.
The travesty is that celeb journalists get all the money and fame while it is the poor “classless” journalists like Jagendra Singh (who are either independent local journalists or reporters working for paltry salaries), who do the groundwork and indulge in real journalism, get penury and anonymity, and sometimes, death.
Gone are the days when journalists toiled in the fields or took risks themselves to unearth some scam or dig out some information that was kept away from the common masses. Now is the era where celeb journalists just pontificate and freeload over the work done by poor faceless reporters.
Even after the advent of RTI, hardly any of these celeb journalists used the tool to expose any wrongdoings or scam. We have a group of faceless people called “RTI activists” (who too are killed like Jagendra Singh was killed), and their work is “stolen” by our celeb journalists. Shouldn't our media organizations have been the real RTI activists?
But why will they risk their lives and risk “relationships” with political honchos when there are Jagendras willing to do some real groundwork, whose work can always be freeloaded upon by the mainstream media?
Our established media and celebrity journalists know that their power and fame (and salaries) are dependent on these real hardworking people living in obscurity and penury; that is why they are scared of making heroes out of Jagendra.
And that is the reason for apathy. No need to make a hero out of Jagendra and accord them that “class” that is reserved only for the Lutyens journalists.
That is why their concern for Jagendra won't go beyond a token tweet. There will not be a string of op-eds or any silent marches. There will not be a long lasting TV campaign seeking justice.
And yes, no celeb journalist will feel threatened due to this mafia-like-murder, because this is not as bad as some random tweet containing abusive words – the only risk the celeb journalists face in their profession. The real risks are faced by faceless and nameless and “classless” Jagendras.
A well known expert on nothing. Opinions totally personal. RTs, sometimes even my own tweets, not endorsement. #Sarcasm. As unbiased as any popular journalist.

Two new studies led by researchers at McMaster University and St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton have found that individuals diagnosed with ADHD or obesity are more likely to choose smaller immediate rewards over larger future rewards.
This reduced capacity to delay gratification in many individuals diagnosed with ADHD or obesity may lead to new approaches for the clinical treatment of these conditions.
The studies, led by Drs. James MacKillop and Michael Amlung of the Peter Boris Centre for Addictions Research at McMaster University and St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, have been published in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging and Psychological Medicine.
The findings from these new studies parallel a 2011 study conducted by the authors that found that the ability to delay gratification was reduced in individuals diagnosed with addictive disorders.
"In the context of addictions, there is an increasing appreciation that we need to improve treatment that we provide for patients who substantially devalue future rewards," said MacKillop. "These studies suggest that a simple assessment that measures this phenomenon may also help clinicians to better understand some of their patients that have been diagnosed with ADHD and obesity."
The studies were meta-analyses, or studies that combine the findings across many previous investigations to detect consistent or inconsistent patterns of findings. In the case of the ADHD study, the meta-analysis combined the findings from 21 previous studies including almost 4,000 participants. In the case of the obesity study, the meta-analysis combined the findings from almost 39 studies including over 10,000 participants.
Although the results of prior research appeared to be mixed, these new studies found a highly consistent reduction in capacity to delay gratification in relation to both clinical conditions.
"While not all individuals diagnosed with ADHD and obesity display this pattern of reduced capacity to delay gratification, the connection between this phenomenon and addictions as well as these clinical conditions is clear," said Amlung.
"In the context of obesity specifically, these findings may help inform clinical approaches to weight management that increase individuals' focus toward the longer-term rewards of weight loss."
A second important finding in both studies was that, although the methods varied considerably across the previous studies, reanalyzing the data based on different methods did not appreciably alter the overall findings.
"These studies suggest that, despite different experimental tasks, ages and study designs, immediate reward orientation is robustly elevated in both ADHD and obesity," said Dr. MacKillop.
The studies were funded in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Peter Boris Centre for Addictions Research.
Family members of the slain rationalists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare on Friday asked whether the government was serious about the probe into two cases.
While Dabholkar, an anti-superstition activist, was murdered in Pune in August 2013, CPI leader Pansare was murdered in Kolhapur in February 2015. Maharashtra police have arrested one person in Pansare case, while CBI has failed to make any arrest in the Dabholkar murder case.
“It has been 32 months since Dabholkar was murdered and 16 months since Pansare was murdered. However, there is no concrete development in both cases. It seems the government is not serious enough to solve them,” said Shaila Dabholkar, Narendra Dabholkar's wife.
If the government did not take murders of rationalists seriously, India would have the same situation as in the neighbouring Bangladesh where secular bloggers and activists were being killed with impunity, they said.
Hamid Dabholkar, the murdered rationalist's son, said the family had sought a meeting with the Prime Minister.
“Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had assured us that they would facilitate a meeting with the honourable PM, however, to date, we have not succeeded (in meeting the PM),” they said.
Pansare's wife Uma said the Maharashtra police's SIT arrested Sameer Gaikwad, former follower of the conservative Hindu outfit Sanatan Sanstha, in connection with the murder, but then the probe stalled, showing lack of political will to take it to the conclusion.
“SIT officers do not have time to look after the case, so despite having evidence against Gaikwad, the probe has slowed down,” they alleged.
“Now they are framing charges against Gaikwad...with incomplete evidence, they might be acquitted,” they said.
The question, therefore, arises whether the state government was shielding the masterminds of the murder, they said.

When choosing a Brisbane bar for the perfect first date, follow these simple rules and you'll be sliding into third base before last call.
Definitely Open. Unless you're Joseph Gordon Levitt, you're not cute and quirky enough to make a first date at the closest McDonald's work. None of these Brisbane bars have the kind of helter-skelter opening hours that leave you banging your fists upon a closed door.
Atmosphere matters. Too busy and you risk losing your date (and your sanity) in the crowd. Too empty and a play-by-play of your date is going to end up on Twitter, courtesy of a bemused bartender.
Chat friendly. No adult has ever fallen in love whilst trying to scream at their date over the top of a badly remixed Justin Bieber song.
Is that the time? Dating is like opening a Kinder Surprise; sometimes you get a cool robot toy, and sometimes you get a piece of a puzzle. Which is to say, a bar with a quick escape route is key.
Nearby food options. Your date laughs at your dad jokes, is successfully pretending to like superhero movies, and thus the thought of saying goodnight after a couple of drinks makes you take on the properties of velcro. Extend people, extend!
Good lighting. Let's save harsh lighting for the second date shall we?
So, with this fail-safe criteria in mind, here are twelve Brisbane bars that are perfect for a first date.
The End
West End
This little bar tucked away in West End might just be the perfect first date spot. The decor is video store inspired (remnants from a previous tenant), the lighting is dim, and the drinks list impressive. Free tip: buy your lady friend to Forget Me Not cocktail from The End's selection. It's the alcoholic equivalent to a bunch of flowers with a delightful mix of lavender, blueberry, violet, vanilla, and lemon.
Junk Bar
Ashgrove
If you suggest a first date that involves traipsing through the woods with visions of pine needles underfoot and fresh forest air filling your lungs, your date is going to think you are trying to murder them A date at the Junk Bar however, with its woodsy interior and comfy couches, is a little less creep, and a little more chic.
The New Inchcolm Hotel
Spring Hill
For the classy first date option, The New Inchcolm Hotel lives to serve. Both Thomson's Reserve and Socialite Bar are the perfect spot for a date no matter how long you've been together. We're particular fans of Socialite Bar's small plates and cocktail menu; ideal for an intro to a potential new lover.
The Bearded Lady
West End
Unless you fancy shouting at your date over the cacophony of a crowd of rowdy hipsters, then leave this West End Bar for the weeknights. The Bearded Lady serves up a stellar selection of beer, and pipes through the kind of music you wouldn't be ashamed to have as ‘your' song.
Eleven Rooftop Bar
Fortitude Valley
There is a reason that a significant amount of romantic movies have a rooftop scene. That's because rooftops are just so damn romantic. Inspired by the cocktail culture of Ibiza and New York, Eleven Rooftop Bar showcases a stunning panorama of Brisbane city. High above the traffic, and the rambling drunks, this rooftop bar is perfect for a first date.
At Sixes and Sevens
New Farm
Imagine yourself in sixty years, your lover's wrinkly hand in yours as you cruise down James St to lay your eyes on the Brisbane venue where everything began. Now, do you want to be showing your grandkids a yellowing Chinese restaurant, or the super slick facade of At Sixes and Sevens. With a gorgeous interior and a menu of tasty share plates, this place is a first date winner.
Papa Jack's
Fortitude Valley
If your date orders the fried chicken and waffles and washes it down with a shrub, then you have found a good egg. Papa Jack's is a Brisbane bar that's captured the heart and soul of its muse, the city of New Orleans, and it does it well. For gorgeous cocktails, and that mighty fine fried chicken, take your date to Papa Jack's.
Madame Wu
Brisbane CBD
If you can resist the urge to do a walrus face with your chopsticks, Madame Wu is a first date option that is equal parts sexy and cool. Serving up amazing modern Asian food, cocktails, an impressive selection of wine from the cellar, and one of the best river views in town, wooing your date at Madame Wu is a cinch (you saw that one coming, didn't you?).
Jungle
West End
Just like the actual jungle, dating can be a prickly and terrifying business—it can really only end it two ways: death or heartbreak. Two things that will be far, far away from your mind at Brisbane's only tiki bar! Emanating a happy yellow glow that makes you think of pineapples and sunshine, Jungle might be the happiest first date destination in Brisbane.
Dutch Courage
Fortitude Valley
There is never a more appropriate time to knock back a little Dutch courage than on a first date. Vaguely reminiscent of the raucous bar in Top Gun, with palm fronds and an officers' mess vibe. So, if you've lost that loving feeling, take your honey to Dutch Courage.
Sonny's House of Blues
Brisbane CBD
If a friendly dive bar is your jam, it's hard to beat Sonny's, a Brisbane bar and food joint that takes up residence in Rowes Lane. Colourful lights and cozy booths create a casual but fun vibe that is perfect for sneaky weeknight tequila shots with your new amore.
Brooklyn Standard
Brisbane CBD
Occupy those fidgety hands with a bowlful of pretzels and a Blue Moon witbier at this Brooklyn inspired bar. This free-spirited underground hangout has regular live music, a decent drinks list, and a cosy vibe that will have you and your date approaching second base in no time.
For the second time today, Daniel Cates ran pocket kings into pocket aces. This time, they were much more live than last time when they were all in against Steve O'Dwyer's quad aces on the flop, but that didn't stop Cates from expressing their frustration in a ridiculous manner.
After the money went in and Rossiter tabled the , Cates yelled out, "Are you f***ing kidding me?!?!" before throwing their cards across the table in the direction of Rossiter.
Cates' hand was the , and someone at the table pointed out to Cates that they could still win the hand with five community cards to come.
The flop, turn, and river ran out to give Rossiter the win, but then Cates exploded by grabbing a handful of chips and throwing them like a baseball player across the table at Rossiter. Some of the chips bounced on the table in front of Rossiter, one or two hit them in the chest, and a couple more stumbled onto the floor. After doing so, Cates just sat there, visibly steamed with what had occurred. Rossiter took it quite well, whereas many people might've freaked out in their own right after having chips hurled at them.
The tournament staff was quickly called, and the discussion began with what was to happen now that it wasn't fully clear that Rossiter had Cates covered. Eventually, it was ruled that Cates had fewer chips than Rossiter and they were eliminated.
Angrily, Cates stormed to the rail and it's left to be seen if he'll fire a third bullet into the event.
The White House lost on its fight over Barack Obama's executive orders on immigration when the Supreme Court had nine members, and it won't get a second chance with the eight remaining. On its first day back in session, the high court denied a rehearing request in US et al v Texas et al, the biggest fight between Washington and the states on enforcement of immigration statutes (via SCOTUSblog):
The Supreme Court refused Monday to reconsider President Obama's proposed overhaul of the nation's immigration system following a tie vote in June that blocked its implementation. The eight-member court's order shut the door on a plan that already seemed all but dead a few months ago. The court declined to wait until a ninth justice is confirmed and seated in order to rehear the case — and possibly reverse its June decision. The high court seldom agrees to rehear cases a second time, but it has on occasion done so when a justice's death or retirement leaves a vacancy that leads to a 4-4 tie. In those cases, the court merely leaves the decision of the lower court intact and sets no national precedent.
Normally it takes four justices to agree on a certiorari request. If that's the case with rehearing requests, then it appears that one or more of the justices who agreed with the Obama administration decided against a rehearing. The original 4-4 vote counted as a loss as it had the practical effect of upholding the 4th Circuit's ruling that struck down the executive orders, although it carries no precedential weight otherwise.
This decision leaves the loss in place, and also leaves Obama and their activism with no tools left to intrude on legislative jurisdiction. Had Obama worked in more good faith on this issue rather than leveraging it for cheap demagoguery, they might have found a compromise with Congress. For that matter, if Obama cared about this issue apart from cheap demagoguery, they would have prioritized immigration reform while their party controlled Congress, rather than backing a useless and expensive stimulus package and the disastrous ObamaCare legislation. They might have made themselves and Democrats a lot more popular in midterm elections, too.
This closes the books for Obama on immigration. They lost, mostly by forfeit.
Update: It closes the books for Obama, but our friend Hans Bader reminds me that it's not over yet. This case involved a temporary injunction; the larger case will still have to be heard, unless the next administration moots it by canceling the executive orders.
Pal Schmitt suffered the indignity of being stripped of their doctorate after a special committee set up by Semmelweis University, Mr Schmitt's alma mater, concluded the president had copied large chunks of their 1992 thesis on Olympic history “word for word”, and condemned their “violation of scientific norms”.
But in a television interview broadcast last night the president argued the fault lay with their advisers and the examining committee. They claimed they had failed to bring the problems with their doctorate to their attention, and, if they had done so, they would have corrected the text.
The public humiliation of a man who is supposed to set a good ethical example has prompted Hungary's political parties to set aside their caustic differences and unite in calls for their resignation. Attila Mesterhazy, the leader of the Socialist party, described Mr Schmitt as “unworthy of the office of president” while Dora Duro, a spokesperson for the nationalist party, said if they tried to remain in office the “wrath of the people” would remove him. Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister and a close ally of the beleaguered president, remained more circumspect about Mr Schmitt's future.
“Nobody except them can decide,” said Mr Orban. But in an indication that the president no longer enjoyed the support of the government and the ruling Fidesz party, an unnamed cabinet minister quoted by the newspaper Népszabadság said that “Schmitt ought to have resigned much earlier” and that the moment of them walking away with their dignity intact had passed.
THERE should be no “price limit” on the search for MH370 because of the importance of solving the mystery.
Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker made the remarks in response to the Federal Government's decision to provide no further funds to the mission in the southern Indian Ocean.
Australian taxpayers have already shelled out $90 million towards the complex operation, and Malaysia and China have also contributed.
In 18 months of searching, vessels using hi-tech equipment have been unable to find any trace of the Boeing 777 although debris has washed ashore on Reunion Island and Mozambique.
Mr Al Baker said it remained of critical importance for countries “in this region” to find out what happened to the Malaysia Airlines flight that disappeared almost without trace over two years ago.
“For me as the CEO of an airline, it's very concerning that the international community for monetary purposes are going to abandon the search for this aeroplane.
“I don't think there is any amount that is too much to find why this tragedy happened where over 200 people lost their lives.”
They said finding answers was of particular relevance to countries “that you reach by being overseas for a long time”.
“IATA (the International Air Transport Association) has not done enough to raise the concerns of the airline community,” said Mr Al Baker, who is in Australia to launch direct flights between Adelaide and Doha.
“It is very critical for all in the industry, all the countries in the world to try to find the wreckage of this plane, to find out exactly what happened.
“In my opinion, it's something unprecedented in our aviation history that an aircraft just disappears without trace and nobody's able to find it, and nobody knows why.”
Jeanette Maguire whose sister Cathy and brother-in-law Bob Lawton were on board MH370 said they understood that the search could not go on indefinitely.
“I have very mixed emotions. This is my sister, their husband and their friends (fellow Australians Rodney and Mary Burrows),” said Ms Maguire.
“I don't want the search to stop. We need to find our loved ones and know where their resting place is.
“But I am also a realist, and you have to ask where the money is going to come from to be able to continue the search. Many millions have been spent so far.”
Officials from Malaysia, China and Australia will meet when the priority search zone is fully scoured, but they have previously announced the operation won't be continued without fresh evidence.
Is Coinbase Safe? No Support Replies, Accounts Locked, and Site/App Down
Coinbase.com is the go-to website for cryptocurrency enthusiasts around the world, and especially in the United States. They have grown to the point of a $1b valuation, but many are doubting whether the company is fit to handle its current volume, let alone any additional users.
The problems are many, and we will break each one of them down…
1.) Horrible Support-Weeks to Reply
Many users are reporting weeks, if not near a month, to receive a reply from Coinbase. We can cite cases of this dating back to the middle of 2016, if not further. If this problem has not been fixed in (at least) a year's time, when will it be?
The biggest concern is that these are generally fairly basic inquiries. If users cannot be helped with basic support queries, what will Coinbase do in the event of a major network wide issue?
2.) Automated Responses
Beyond taking weeks to reply, many of the initial responses are simply boiler plate templates, from “an automated email.” If Coinbase is only going to reply with automated text, why wait weeks to send it at all? One would assume a bot can reply instantly, which would be the least they can do to help speed up the process. Nothing is more frustrating than waiting many days for a reply to your ticket, only to be left with a template reply taken from the support docs (that you probably already read).
3.) Accounts Being Locked
It is totally acceptable for Coinbase to lock accounts in the event of a suspected security breach. After all, the users security needs to come first. This isn't the issue, however.
If an account is going to be locked, there needs to be a systematic, accessible way to recover backend access. If you have thousands of dollars in bitcoin or ethereum, you likely want to be able to access it in order to place trades. Unfortunately, if Coinbase locks your account, you will not only have to jump through many hoops (understandably), but you will have to wait many weeks for the process to be completed.
Coinbase will not allow manual submission of your documents via email. Instead you will be forced to use their ID verifier, which brings us to issue number four…
4.) Faulty/Broken App and Website
In reference to the above, locked accounts can be an absolute nightmare at Coinbase. The app or website may ask you to submit documents for verification, usually multiple forms of IDs. The problem is that the verification process is clunky at best.
If you do not have your documents seamlessly approved by the ID verifier, you will be asked to submit them again. Needless to say, they will likely be denied, again. What is worse, though, is you may not even be allowed to resubmit. In one instance, users could not resubmit their IDs, and when “Try Again” was clicked, an “Invalid Token Access Code” notice was given. This error was never fixed, to the best of our knowledge.
5.) Frequent Downtimes
The biggest criticism Coinbase has faced stems from its incessant and seemingly endless downtimes. Whenever there is a spike, or drop, in the prices of BTC or ETH, you can almost count on Coinbase to go down. This is incredibly aggravating, especially considering that these are usually the best times to buy or sell.
If Coinbase can't handle the volume they are accepting, they should't be taking on new users at such a rapid pace. Yes, there can be blockchain issues, or other problems that are out of their hands, but to encourage signups, hold funds, and then make accounts completely unaccessible is not acceptable. Especially not with the sizeable fees that users pay per buy/sell transaction.
6.) Very Slow Buy/Sell/Transfer Processing Times
If your account is not very well aged with extensive history, be prepared to wait to see buy orders available in your Coinbase account or sell orders converted to cash in your bank account. Users will need to submit a number of verifications to place buy and sell orders, and they will need to repeat the process if they want to withdraw into a bank account and/or raise limits.
The problem here is not necessarily the process, but instead the speed. Many ACH or debit card transactions could be settled many days earlier than they are at Coinbase. If you are looking to either obtain or liquidate cryptos via cash, get ready to wait when using Coinbase.
We encourage you to share your Coinbase experiences below, good or bad, and we hope to see improved service in the future.

The Village Voice got its newsprint-stained hands on an unsigned copy of the 30-page contract MTV gives to Real World cast members. It pretty much absolves MTV of any responsibility, and lets cast know they may be treated in totally inhuman ways, but especially if they're female.
All cast members regardless of gender are made aware they might be subjected to “non-consensual physical contact which could result in which could result in my contracting of any type of sexually transmitted disease, including without limitation, HIV/AIDS, gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Chlamydia, scabies (crabs), hepatitis, genital warts, and other communicable and sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.”
So Real World peeps, you might get raped. Because as it says in the contract, MTV producers are not liable for conducting background checks on potential cast members, and even if they do, they don't have to share the results with you. BUT, if you're raped AND get pregnant (read: female), then you're really in trouble. Section 38 of the contract stipulates that cast members not be pregnant when they start production, and not become pregnant while filming the show. If someone does get pregnant, regardless of how they got that way, they must tell the producer immediately because pregnancy is grounds for dismissal. Interestingly, if you get someone pregnant while on Real World, you are not on the chopping block.
The whole thing's pretty vile, though, regardless of whether you can get pregnant or not. Here's the full contract.
The following is a Guest Post by Andrew Price.
Hoboken is undertaking a massive redesign of Washington Street, our Main Street. Here is what Washington Street looks like today:
Hoboken undertook an initiative to redesign Washington Street. Here was what the engineering firm came up with:
The city voted to take out the bike lanes because the people wanted space to double park for quick errands, so essentially we are back to exactly what we have now, just with a few crossing bulb-outs at the corners, and our traffic lights brought ‘up to code' (which I later found out meant that they will have countdown timers), and some lighting. Small improvements, but I don't know if it would be worth tens of millions of dollars of grants and bonds.
When I hear the word ‘redesign' (especially for that amount of money), I was assuming full on redesign. Disappointed with what was presented to us, I am taking it on myself to design my ideal Washington Street. Now, I am not a traffic engineer or urban designer, just a creative citizen with an idea.
Let's come up with some requirements for our ideal Washington Street:
Safety is a priority. The street needs to be jaywalkable. There needs to be short-term grab-and-go parking spots. We should avoid bringing traffic to a complete stop at intersections. It needs to be a pleasant people-first environment with plenty amenities for people like lighting, shade, and seating. We need a clearance for emergency vehicles, even during peak capacity. We must accommodate buses without impeding traffic, people, or emergency vehicles.
Without further ado, here is a top-down view of a segment of my fantasy Washington Street design:
Here it is looking down the middle at street level:
Instead of asphalt and concrete – which is monotonous and overused in our cities, I chose brick and Belgian block for aesthetics – these are both materials we have used in Hoboken.
A street is the living room of the community. A street is not a road, which is a tool to get from A to B, but a platform for building wealth, culture, and community. People should come first, and transportation accommodated on top. So the first obvious feature about my design is that the middle of the street is dedicated to people. What better way to tell the dominant species that belongs here than what occupies the most space?
Here is a cross-section:
Washington Street is 100 feet wide. The 20 foot sidewalks on either side are the same size as they are now, with enough room for one lane of traffic on either side, creating a 40 foot wide island for people in the middle.
This basic layout is not new, unique, or innovative. 14th Street under the viaduct in Hoboken is already laid out in this format.
Let's take this basic layout, add in some trees, lamps, and benches so we have plenty of spaces to rest and loiter to let the street function as the community's living room.
In order to encourage crossing the street at any given point, there are no curbs. Curbs create artificial obstacles for anyone in a wheelchair, pushing a stroller, or rolling a suitcase. There are much better ways to handle water drainage – such as building actual drains.
In The Case for One-Way Streets, I argued that there are two things that make streets unsafe;
The risk of a vehicle sneaking up behind you, as our heads can only be turned in one direction at a time. An excessively wide ‘danger zone' that you must cross, as you will end up spending more time in the path of danger (increasing your risk of getting hit), while also creating a clearance zone that is too comfortable to drive on that encourages faster speeds, and creating a feeling of disconnection from the other side of the street.
To minimize the amount space occupied by cars, my first instinct for intersections was to simply intersect the travel lanes;
Unfortunately, we have to accommodate cars, trucks, and buses – none of which can make right turns on the spot, and instead have a turning radius. I smoothed out the intersection into circles, which lead to a roundabout design:
I wanted to avoid traffic lights because they frustrate me. I have written about how traffic lights act as synchronization barriers which cause vehicles to cluster together creating congestion. Whether you are a driver or a bus-rider, traffic lights are frustrating, because often they cycle when there is very little traffic in the perpendicular direction, so you spend time waiting, wondering what you are waiting on. Roundabouts, in contrast, keep traffic free-flowing by not bringing any direction to a complete stop and have a greater overall capacity than traffic lights. Also remember that the street is designed to be safe to cross on foot at any point, not just at the intersections.
Let's see the intersection in action:
I left the middle of the street clear for emergency vehicles, so even at full traffic capacity there would be enough room for a clear run through. No more waiting for cars to pull out of the way, and any people that are out walking can easily scoot to the side by the trees and benches.
For the once a year catastrophe that two emergency vehicles have to pass each other, there is plenty of extra space for this around the edge. In the following diagram, I could imagine the red areas – each 10 feet wide – kept clear for emergencies (as well as the middle of the roundabouts to accommodate even the widest turning fire truck), while still leaving 10 feet at the very edge for property owners to do what they wish with – such as setting out tables, chairs, signs, and fences.
Washington Street is an important bus thoroughfare. I wanted the buses to be as minimally intrusive to other traffic and people as much as possible. This means that the bus is not allowed to come to a complete stop while in the traffic lanes as that would hold up traffic. My first idea was to have a bus loading zone bumped out to the right of the travel lane:
But, that seems a little cramped, as well as intrusive to the property owners who's front door would be blocked by the bus shelter! Instead, I decided to bump the bus out into the middle of the street.
During emergencies, the bus can pull into the diagonal lanes (or the emergency vehicle could travel along the side of the street where there are no vehicles):
Parking is a concern for many residents. It is actually a myth that we have a parking shortage (every city believes they have a parking problem!) There is plenty of parking in Hoboken. I once heard the operator of a parking garage say that it is very rare for their garage to be more than one third full. Yet at every city hall meeting you will hear somebody complain about parking. If you listen careful, they never complain that they cannot find a spot in front of their favorite store while they spend hours out of their car walking around, instead the complaints are always about there being a lack of parking spaces to quickly run in and make a delivery or pick something up. People complain about the lack of short term parking.
On-street parking in Hoboken is abused. This is why citizens traded in bike lanes so they would have room to double park. Hoboken is trying to improve the situation with a new pay-by-plate system that will track cars by their license plate. I propose going a step further. I propose that on the side streets that intersect with Washington Street we should switch to Donald Shoup-style dynamic pricing, whereby we automatically adjust prices based on the demand so that around 15% of on-street parking spaces are likely to be free at any given moment. That way, there will always be a vacant parking space for those quick pick ups, and ample garage parking for longer term parking.
If we are going to pay tens of millions of dollars to massively redesign Washington Street, let's massively redesign it! This is my fantasy design. I'm not saying it is the best design for Washington Street, but I feel it is a significant improvement from the design proposed by the engineers that looks very similar to how Washington Street is today. Let us know what you think.

If Correlation Doesn't Imply Causation, Then What Does?
adam kelleher Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 27, 2016
We've all heard in school that “correlation does not imply causation,” but what does imply causation?! The gold standard for establishing cause and effect is a double-blind controlled trial (or the AB test equivalent). If you're working with a system on which you can't perform experiments, is all hope for scientific progress lost? Can we ever understand systems that we have limited or no control over? This would be a very bleak state of affairs, and fortunately there has been progress in answering these questions in the negative!
So what is causality good for? Anytime you decide to take an action, in a business context or otherwise, you're making some assumptions about how the world operates. That is, you're making assumptions about the causal effects of possible actions. Most of the time, we only consider very simple actions: I should eat, because the causal effect of “eating” on “hunger” is negative. I should show more impressions of this ad, because the causal effect of impressions on pageviews is positive. What about more complex interventions? What about the downstream effects? Maybe showing more impressions of the ad increases pageviews of it, but it draws traffic away from something more shareable, reducing traffic to the site as a whole. Is there a way to make all of the downstream causal effects obvious? Is there a way to make causal assumptions explicit, so their merits can be discussed, and our model of the world can improve?
The more I read and talked to people about the subject of causality, the more I realized the poor state of common knowledge on the subject. In discussing it with our group, we decided to work through Causality by Judea Pearl in our Math Club. There have been a lot of great questions and discussions coming out of those sessions, so I decided to finally start writing up some of the discussions here. I'll do my best to give proper credit where it's due (with permission), but I apologize to any participants I leave out!
For this first post, I'd like to explain what causality is all about, and talk a little about what “evidence” means. This falls a little outside of the standard pedagogy, but I think it's a useful way of looking at things. You'll see that it can give us a model of the world to discuss and build on over time, and we'll take a step toward measuring the downstream effects of interventions!
What is Causality?
The term “causality” has a nice intuitive definition, but has eluded being well-defined for decades. Consider your commute to work. We have an intuitive understanding that traffic will cause you to be late for work. We also know that if your alarm doesn't go off, it will cause you to be late to work. We can draw this as a picture, like figure 1.
Fig. 1 : Basic cause and effect
This picture is a great start, but these are really just two of the most common causes of being late for work. Others could include your car not starting, forgetting to make the kids lunch, getting distracted by the news, etc. etc. How can our picture incorporate all of these little things that we don't include? Can we ever hope to get a reasonable picture of the world when we can't possibly measure all of the causes and effects?
The answer turns out to be relatively simple. Our model just needs to include the most common, large effects on our trip to work. If we omit a large number of small, independent effects, we can just treat them as “noise”. We stop talking about things as being completely determined by the causes we take into account. Instead, we talk about a cause as increasing the chances of its effect. You go from intuitions like “my alarm not going off causes me to be late” to intuitions like “my alarm not going off causes me to be much more likely to be late”. I think you'll agree that the second statement reflects our understanding of reality much better. It takes care of the host of “what-if” questions that come up from all of the unlikely exceptions we haven't taken into account. “What if I happened to wake up at the right time anyhow when my alarm didn't go off?” or “What if I was tired enough that I overslept, even though my alarm did go off?”. These are all incorporated as noise. Of course we're free to add any of these things into our picture as we like. It's just that we may prefer not to. There's an exception we'll talk about briefly in a moment. First, we need one more idea.
Fig. 2: A slightly more complete picture of the world
We can build a much more comprehensive picture by chaining together causes and effects. What are the causes of traffic? What are the causes of the alarm not going off? If there's a disaster, it could cause the power to go out, preventing the alarm from going off. It could also cause traffic. Our new picture should look something like figure 2. This picture says something very important. Notice that if a disaster happens, it's both more likely both that your alarm will fail to go off, and that there will be traffic. This means in a data set where you measure days on which there is traffic, and whether your alarm goes off on those days you'll find a correlation between the two. We know there's no causal effect of your alarm going off on whether or not there's traffic (assuming you drive like a sane person when you're late), or vice versa. This is the essence of “correlation does not imply causation”. When there is a common cause between two variables, then they will be correlated. This is part of the reasoning behind the less-known phrase, “There is no correlation without causation”[1]. If neither A nor B causes the other, and the two are correlated, there must be some common cause of the two. It may not be a direct cause of each of them, but it's there somewhere “upstream” in the picture. This implies something extremely powerful. You need to control for common causes if you're trying to estimate a causal effect of A on B (read more about confounding). If there were a rigorous definition of “upstream common cause,” then there would be a nice way to choose what to control for. It turns out there is, and it's rooted in these nice pictures (“causal graphs”). This can be the subject of a future post.
It turns out that if you don't include hidden common causes in your model, you'll estimate causal effects incorrectly. This raises a question: can we possibly hope to include all of the hidden common causes? What other alternative is there, if this approach fails?
How Science Works
We're asking questions at the core of the scientific method. I'll try to avoid getting into the philosophy of science, and instead make some observations based on basic formulae. Suppose we think the world works according to our first picture, fig. 1. We want to test out this assumption, that fig. 1 is really how the world works. The absence of a cause-effect relationship between traffic and the alarm going off, in these pictures, means there is no causal relationship between the two, whatsoever (including unobserved common causes!). Disasters are rare. It's conceivable that in the limited amount of time we've been observing traffic and our alarm going off, we've never seen one.
As time goes on, more and more disasters might happen, and Fig. 1 stands on shaky footing. We start to accumulate data points with the disasters' effect on traffic and the alarm clock. Maybe we live in the midwestern United States, where tornadoes are relatively common, or California, where earthquakes are and the collection happens quickly. Over time, we'll go from a statistically insignificant measurement of a correlation between traffic and alarm clock, and reach a statistically significant one. Voila! We have evidence that our model is incorrect. Fig. 1 shows no cause-effect relationship between alarm and traffic, but we're observing that they're correlated, and we know there is “no correlation without causation”. The disasters are the cause that is missing from our model.
What does the correct picture look like? We can use our background knowledge of how the world works to say there's no causal link between the alarm and traffic, and so there must be some unobserved common cause between the two. Since we're only observing the alarm clock, traffic, and lateness, we can only update our model with the knowledge that it's wrong, since it neglects an unobserved common cause. How do we do this? As it happens, there's a way to write this, with a double-ended arrow as in fig. 3. The double-ended arrow is a way to say “there is some unobserved common cause between alarm and traffic”.
Fig 3: An unobserved common cause
Now we know we need to start looking at the causes of the alarm going off and of traffic. Hopefully, we'll eventually narrow it down to fig. 2.
Notice that it took a lot of data to find a situation where we started noticing the missing link between the alarm and traffic. You can get an intuitive sense that maybe, even though some links and variables might be missing, we have something “close enough” to the whole picture. What are the odds that fig. 2 is wrong today? How bad is my estimate of the odds that I would have been late if my alarm had actually gone off, in general?
It turns out that the answer is, because disasters are rare, you won't be too far off. That's true even if there's a 100% chance of being late given that a disaster happens. Over time, we can take even this small amount of error into account.
There is precedent for this type of advancement in physics. We generally don't regard a set of laws as being the complete picture, but they're “good enough” for the situation we're considering. We have known that Newton's gravity theory is missing some important pieces, and that Einstein's General Relativity is a more complete picture. Even so, Newtonian gravity was enough to get us to the moon. It's not enough, however, to operate a GPS system. The reason we hadn't had to use it before was that there were relatively few situations where we needed to model high energy systems acting over large distances and times. This is analogous to our example where the chances of a disaster are low. There were a few situations that stood out as anomalous, like the precession of Mercury which suggested that the model as we understood it would break down. Over time, you find more anomalies, and improve your picture of the world.
We've answered part of the question. We see that we have to have larger and larger datasets to capture rare effects, and so our understanding of the world could improve over time. What remains is whether we're guaranteed to notice all anomalies, and whether that matters. We've seen that the incomplete model can be useful. Soon we'll talk about the prospects of noticing all anomalies that aren't included in our model. Is it even possible, with an infinite dataset? Once we have the model, is it possible to estimate the odds that we're wrong with a specific prediction? This might be the subject of a future post. For now, let's talk a little more about how to use these types of models.
What Would Have Happened If …?
The question of “What would have happened if things were different?” is an essentially causal question. You're asking what would be the effect if the world had operated differently than it was observed to, perhaps based on some policy intervention. The question “What would have happened if I had intervened in the system with some policy intervention?” is essentially the question “What is the causal effect of this policy intervention on the system?”. If you only observe how the system normally operates, you'll generally get the wrong answer. For example, if you intervene to make sure your alarm never fails to go off (for example, by switching to a battery powered alarm clock), then you will underestimate the odds of being late to work. You'll misattribute lateness due to traffic (which happens at the same time as your clock failing to go off!) as being due to your alarm clock, and so overestimate the effect of the alarm failing to go off.
This type of question is at the core of a lot of business and policy decisions. What would happen if our recommender system didn't exist? What would happen if we made some changes to our supply chain? What would be the effect of a certain policy intervention on homelessness? All of these questions are extremely hard to answer experimentally, and can't necessarily be answered from statistical data (i.e. large data sets). They could be relatively easier to answer if we have a good causal model of how the system operates, to go with our statistical data, and possibly supplemented by the few experiments within the system that we're able to do. We'll talk about how that's done in some future posts!
[Edit:] This is the first post in a series! Check out the rest here!
[Edit:] [1] To be completely precise: what we mean here is that all statistical dependence comes from causal structure. We're NOT saying that statistical dependence between X and Y means X causes Y or vice versa. We're saying the structure, as describable by some (possibly unknown) causal graph is the reason for the dependence. To draw out the point: the dependence might be due to a confounder, where X ← Z → Y, due to sampling on a common effect, X → Z ← Y, where we sample based on Z. To revise the quote, we might say “there is no correlation without causation somewhere”. Thanks to Ed Cashin for helpful feedback!
At least 20 people were killed when a mine collapsed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the government says.
The miners were 30m (98ft) underground when the tunnel collapsed on Thursday near the village of Rubaye in the country's North Kivu province.
It reportedly followed heavy rain. Officials in the town of Masisi said rescuers had not yet started to dig for bodies on Friday.
Such accidents are common in DR Congo, where mines are often unregulated.
Dieudonne Shishuku, mayor of Masisi, told the BBC Great Lakes service that search teams were waiting for heavy equipment to arrive before beginning the digging operation.
Profits from the country's enormous mineral resources are widely seen as helping fuel conflict in DR Congo, while most of the population remains in poverty.
Mayor appoints former Metropolitan Police Authority chair Lord Harris to examine how city would cope with multiple attacks
London's ability to tackle a major terrorist attack is to be reviewed by the former chairperson of the Metropolitan Police Authority, Sadiq Khan has announced.
The London mayor said the review of the city's response – coming after the recent attacks on Paris and Brussels – would be led by Lord Harris, a former London Assembly member who oversaw the Met's national counter-terror strategy for the Home Office.
“Nothing is more important to me than keeping Londoners safe,” the mayor said.

The review will look at how the city would cope if multiple attacks were launched, examining the arrangements in place across all the emergency services.
Khan said: “I want to be reassured that every single agency and individual involved in protecting our city has the resources and expertise they need to respond in the event that London is attacked.”
The emergency services along with Transport for London, the Port of London Authority and local government representatives will be contacted as part of the review, which is expected to release its findings in the summer.
The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said: “Although we are confident the Met can deal effectively if terrorists did strike our city, and we test ourselves regularly, we are never complacent about the city's security and recognise that there will always be ways in which we can improve.”
New Delhi: India is projected to see impact investments worth up to $40 billion by 2025 as the country is in a “sweet spot" with high potential to deliver solutions for various problems, according to global grouping Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN).
Based in New York, the GIIN is a not-for-profit group that works to promote impact investments and has around 230 members. Generally, impact investments refer to those made with the aim of having a social and environmental impact along with the investors getting financial returns.
GIIN's advisor for South Asia, Anil Sinha said, there has been tremendous development in India around impact investing activities in the last five years and the country is in a sweet spot. “In India, about $4 billion has been invested as part of impact investments in about five years. On an average annual basis, it is around $1 billion," Sinha told PTI in an interview.
India is a place where poverty is high but the potential to deliver solutions is also very high, Sinha said, adding the country can be a global innovation hub for models that can address issues at the base of the pyramid.
“We hope there will be 25% annual growth rate as it (impact investments) grow and it might grow from $4 billion to $35-40 billion in India by 2025," they said. At current exchange rates, it translates to a range between Rs2,24,000 and Rs2,56,000 crore.
Globally, total assets under management by impact investors is estimated to be about $70 billion, according to Sinha. The financial returns on impact investments is estimated to be around 10% annually.
Sinha, a private sector finance specialist who has served in various roles at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), said impact investments are evolving and their global growth rate is around 25%. They noted that financial inclusion and energy have been dominant areas in the $4 billion impact investment portfolio in India.
GIIN, as a promoter of impact investing activities, is looking to attract more Indian companies to be impact investors. “We are certainly playing a role in defining the role of impact investing and social enterprises. We need to have our own definition of social enterprises," Sinha said.

HS2 train seats will need to be larger to accommodate obese passengers, the network's managing director has said.
Customers are "getting bigger" meaning the trains will have to be heavier and larger than usual, according to the network's managing director of railway operations.
In a presentation to rail industry executives, Chris Rayner said: "HS2 trains will need to offer space for taller people and [allow for] much higher instances of obesity among passengers."
According to the Sunday Times, they said companies' responses to the problem of passengers' growing waistlines would be part of the the bidding process for the £2.75bn contract to build 60 trains for the high-speed network.
HS2 is set to link London, Birmingham, the East Midlands, Leeds and Manchester. It is projected to cost £55.7 billion.
There has been some speculation that the network might be dropped by the Conservative government under pressure from backbench MPs from the south of England concerned about the cost.
But on Saturday Theresa May told The Yorkshire Post that the Government was "absolutely committed" to completing it.
The suspension of belief is commonly needed for science fiction. Most space dramas require alien races to speak English or the existence of some form of instantaneous universal translator. It now seems that something similar is required when moving in fiscal space. Fiscal space is the money available for new measures while achieving minimum compliance with the rules. Lots of words are being used to describe this but can we tell what they actually mean?
On Monday, the European Commission issued their Country-Specific Recommendations as part of the European Semester. Here are some extracts from Ireland's CSRs covering fiscal outcomes:
On 12 July 2016, the Council recommended Ireland to achieve an annual fiscal adjustment of 0.6% of GDP towards the medium-term budgetary objective in 2017. Based on the Commission 2017 spring forecast, there is a risk of a significant deviation from the recommended fiscal adjustment over 2016 and 2017 taken together. According to the commonly agreed adjustment matrix under the Stability and Growth Pact, that adjustment translates into a requirement of a nominal growth rate of net primary government expenditure which does not exceed 2.4% in 2018. It would correspond to an annual structural adjustment of 0.6 % of GDP. The expenditure benchmark reflects an adjustment to correct for a distortion to the 10-year reference rate of potential growth caused by the exceptionally high surge in real GDP growth in 2015. Following the approach taken by the Irish authorities in their Budget 2017 calculations, the Commission has taken the average of potential growth rates in 2014 and 2016. Under unchanged policies, there is a risk of some deviation from the requirement over 2017 and 2018 taken together. At the same time, Ireland is forecast to comply with the transitional debt rule in 2017 and 2018. Overall, the Council is of the opinion that further measures will be needed, notably in 2017, to comply with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In view of Ireland's current cyclical conditions and the heightened external risks, the use of any windfall gains to further reduce the general government debt ratio would be prudent. However, as foreseen in Regulation (EC) No 1466/97, the assessment of the budgetary plans and outcomes should take account of the Member State's budgetary balance in light of the cyclical conditions. As recalled in the Commission Communication accompanying these country-specific recommendations, the assessment of the 2018 Draft Budgetary Plan and subsequent assessment of 2018 budget outcomes will need to take due account of the goal to achieve a fiscal stance that contributes to both strengthening the ongoing recovery and ensuring the sustainability of Ireland's public finances. In that context, the Commission intends to make use of the applicable margin of appreciation in light of the cyclical situation of Ireland.

It's been about five years since LA duo Randy Randall and Dean Spunt formed No Age, the noise-pop band carved in the wake of hardcore trio Wives. The marriage of drone, fuzz and feedback, with occasional rays of melody shining through the cracks was a revelation on their 2007 debut Weirdo Rippers and provided a soundtrack for the nascent, self-sustaining group of bands and fans centred around all-ages venue the Smell.
No Age's 2008 follow-up, Nouns, continued certain recognisable traditions: songs clocked in at less than two and a half minutes; hazy sounds were thickened by shout-along choruses; seductively incomprehensible lyrics fought to be heard. Fans are likely to greet the arrival of their third album, Everything in Between, with the happy sentiment that it's more of the same. It's an album which veers between all-out punk and delicate sentiments ("I want you back underneath my skin"), a collection of songs that the band describe as "a culmination of reflecting upon life's ruptures and triumphs ... the process of moving through these moments banged and bruised". Typical No Age, but in the best possible way. Let us know what you think on the space below.
One of the most dynamic sectors of the sharing economy is the trend in large cities toward more collaborative consumption — and the entrepreneurs have followed, from Airbnb too Getable to Freecycle. Whether it's co-working, bike sharing, exchanging books and videos, or cohabiting hackerspaces and community garden spaces, there are green shoots throughout the economy that suggest the way we work, play and learn is changing due to the impact of connection technologies and the Great Recession.
This isn't just about the classic dilemma of “buy vs. rent.” It's about whether people or organizations can pool limited resources to more efficiently access tools or services as needed and then pass them back into a common, if appropriate.
Speaking to TechCrunch last year, Lauren Anderson floated the idea that a collaborative consumption revolution might be as “significant as the Industrial Revolution.” We'll see about that. The new sharing economy is clearly a powerful force, as a recent report (PDF) by Latitude Research and Shareable Magazine highlighted, but it's not clear yet if it's going to transform society and production in the same way that industrialized mass production did in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Carsharing is saving
What is clear is that, after years of spreading through the private sector, collaborative consumption is coming to government, and it's making a difference. A specific example: Carsharing via Zipcar in city car fleets is saving money and enabling government to increase its efficacy and decrease its use of natural resources.
After finally making inroads into cities, Zipcar is saving taxpayers real money in the public sector. Technology developed by the car-sharing startup is being used in 10 cities and municipalities in 2012. If data from a pilot with the United States General Services Agency fleet pans out, the technology could be also adopted across the sprawling federal agency's vehicles, saving tens of millions of dollars of operating expenses though smarter use of new technology.
“Now the politics are past, the data are there,” said Michael Serafino, general manager for Zipcar's university and FastFleet programs, in a phone interview. “Collaborative consumption isn't so difficult from other technology. We're all used to networked laser printers. The car is just a tool to do business. People are starting to come around to the idea that it can be shared.”
As with many other city needs, vehicle fleet management in the public sector shares commonalities across all cities. In every case, municipal governments need to find a way to use the vehicles that the city owns more efficiently to save scarce funds.
The FastFleet product has been around for a little more than three years, said Serafino. Zipcar started it in beta and then took a “methodical approach” to rolling it out.
FastFleet uses the same mechanism that's used throughout thousands of cars in the Zipcar fleet: a magnetized smartcard paired with a card reader in the windshield that can communicate with a central web-based reservation system.
There's a one-time setup charge to get a car wired for the system and then a per-month charge for the FastFleet service. The cost of that installation varies, predicated upon the make of vehicles, type of vehicles and tech that goes into them. Zipcar earns its revenue in a model quite similar to cloud computing and software-as-a-service, where operational costs are billed based upon usage.
Currently, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Santa Cruz, Calif., Boston, New York and Wilmington, Del. are all using FastFleet to add carsharing capabilities to their fleets, with more cities on the way. (Zipcar's representative declined to identify which municipalities are next.)
Boston's pilot cut its fleet in half
“Lots of cities have departments where someone occasionally needs a car,” said Matthew Mayrl, chief of staff in the Boston Public Works department, during a phone interview.
“They buy one and then use it semi-frequently, maybe one to two times per week. But they do need it, so they can't give up the car. That means it's not being used for highest utilization.”
The utilization issue is the key pain point, in terms of both efficiency and cost. Depending on the make and model, it generally costs between $3,000 and $7,000 on average for a municipality to operate a vehicle, said Serafino. “Utilization is about 30% in most municipal fleets,” they said.
That's where collaborative consumption became too relevant to Boston. Mayrl said Boston's Public Works Department talked to Zipcar representatives with two goals in mind: get out of a manual reservation system and reduce the number of cars the city uses, which would reduce costs in the process. “Our public works was, for a long time, administered by a city motor pool,” Mayrl said. “It was pretty old school: stop by, get keys, borrow a car.”
While Boston did decide to join up with Zipcar, public sector workers aren't using actual Zipcars. The city has licensed Zipcar's FastFleet technology and is adding it to the existing fleet.
One benefit to using just the tech is that it can be integrated with cars that are already branded with the “City of Boston,” pointed out Mayrl. That's crucial when the assessing office is visiting a household, they said: In that context, it's important to be identified.
Boston started a pilot in February that was rolled out to existing users of public works vehicles, along with two pilots in assessing and the Department of Motor Vehicles. The program started by taking the oldest cars off the road and training the relevant potential drivers. Using carsharing, the city of Boston was able to reduce the number of vehicles in the pilot by over 50%.
“Previously, there were 28 cars between DPW [the Public Works department] and those elsewhere in the department,” said Mayrl. “That's been cut in half. Now we have 12 to 14 cars without any missed reservations. This holds a lot of promise, only a month in. We don't have to worry about maintenance or whether someone is parked in the wrong place or cleaning snow off a car. We hope that if this is successful, we can roll it out to other departments.”
The District's fleet gets leaner
While a 50% reduction in fleet size looks like significant cost savings, Serafino said that a 2:1 ratio is actually a conservative number.
“We strive for 3:1,” Serafino said. “The one thing we have is data. We capture and gather data from every single use of every single vehicle by every single driver, at a very granular level, including whenever a driver gets in and out. That allows a city to measure real utilization and efficiency. Using those numbers, officials can drive policy and other things. You can take effective utilization and real utilization and say, ‘we're taking away these four cars from this area.' You can use hard data gathered by the system to make financial and efficiency decisions.”
Based upon the results to date, Serafino said they expect Washington, DC, to triple its investment in the system. “The original pilot was started by a mandated reduction by [former DC Mayor Adrian] Fenty, who said ‘make this goal,' and ‘get it done by this date.' Overall, DC went from 365 to 80 vehicles by consolidating and cooperating.”
Serafino estimated the reduction represents about 50% of the opportunity for DC to save money. “The leader of the DC Department of Public Works wants to do more,” they said. “The final plans are to get to a couple of hundred vehicles under management, resulting in another reduction by at least 200 cars.” Serafino estimated potential net cost savings would be north of $1 million per year.
There is a floor, however, for how lean a city's car fleet can become — and a ceiling for optimal utilization as well.
“The more you reduce, the harder it gets,” said Serafino. “DC may have gone too far, by going down to 80 [vehicles]. It has hurt mobility.” If you cut into fat deep enough, in other words, eventually you hit muscle and bone.
“DC is passing 70% utilization on a per-day basis,” said Serafino. “They have three to four people using each of the cars every day. The trip profile, in the government sense, is different from other customers. We don't expect to go over 80%. There is a point where you can get too lean. DC has kind of gotten there now.”
In Boston, Mayrl said they did a financial analysis of how to reduce costs from their car fleet. “It was cheaper to better manage the cars we have than to buy new ones. Technology helps us do that. [Carsharing] had already been done in a couple of other cities. Chicago does it. The city of DC does it. We went to a competitive bid for an online vehicle fleet management software system. [Zipcar] was the only respondent.”
Given that FastFleet has been around for more than three years and there's a strong business case for employing the technology, the rate of adoption by American cities might seem to be a little slow to outside observers. What would be missing from that analysis are the barriers to entry for startups that want to compete in the market for government services.
“What hit us was the sales cycle,” said Zipcar's Serafino. “The average is about 18 months to two years on city deals. That's why they're all popping now, with more announcements to come soon.”
The problem, Serafino mused, was not making the case for potential cost savings. “Cities will only act as sensitive as politics will allow,” said Serafino.
“Boston, San Francisco, New York and Chicago are trying. The problem is the automotive and vehicle culture,” Serafino said. “That, combined with the financial aspects of decentralized budgeting for fleets, is the bane of fleet managers. Most automotive fleet managers in cities don't control their own destinies. Chicago is one of the very few cities where they can control the entire fleet.
Cities do have other options to use technology to manage their car fleets, from telematics providers to GPS devices to web-based reservation systems, each of which may be comparatively less expensive to buy off the shelf.
One place that Zipcar will continue to face competition at the local level is from companies that provide key vending machines, which are essentially automated devices on garage walls.
“You go get a key and go to a car,” said Serafino. “If you have 20 cars in one location, it's not as likely to make sense to choose our system. If you have 50 cars in three locations, that's a different context. You can't just pick up a keybox and move it.”
Collaborative consumption goes federal?
Zipcar is continuing along the long on-ramp to working with government. The next step for the company may be to help Uncle Sam with the federal government's car fleet.
As noted previously, the U.S. General Services Agency (GSA) has already done a collaborative consumption pilot using part of its immense vehicle fleet. Serafino says the GSA is now using that data to prepare a broader procurement action for a request for proposals.
The scale for potential cost savings is significant: The GSA manages some 210,000 vehicles, including a small but growing number of electric vehicles.
Given congressional pressure to find cost savings in the federal budget, if the GSA can increase the utilization of its fleet in a way that's even vaguely comparable to the savings that cities are finding, collaborative consumption could become quite popular in Congress.
If carsharing at the federal level succeeded similarly well at scale, members of Congress and staff that became familiar with collaborative consumption through the wildly popular Capital bike sharing program may well see the sharing economy in a new light.
“There's a broader international trend to work to share resources more efficiently, from energy to physical infrastructure,” said Mayrl. “Like every good city, we're copying the successful stuff elsewhere.”

You may have come across a 2004 image of an American soldier in Iraq holding two huge “camel spiders,” one of which had clamped its jaws on the other. Huge. As in, they alone were reason enough to get out of Iraq. Now, they aren't really spiders, and through a trick of perspective (they're just close to the camera) they look way bigger than they really are. Don't get me wrong, the strange, hairy camel spiders do grow to six inches long—not too shabby. But size is far from the most fascinating thing about these beasts.
Camel spiders are arachnids like true spiders, but they belong to a different order, solifugae. (Depending on who you ask, camel spiders are so-called because some species have humps on their backs or because of the myth that they eat camel stomachs.) Also called wind scorpions for their incredible speed (and hey, why not confuse them for another kind of arachnid while we're at it), these things have jaws like you wouldn't believe—dextrous chompers that can be a third of their body length and that shred prey as big as rodents.
With these beasts comes lore. In addition to the camel stomach stuff, legend says that as camel spiders scream as they speed around the desert, that they can leap incredible distances, and that they'll even attack humans, injecting them with a sleepy-time venom and gnawing on the victims as they slumber.
None of these things are any truer-to-life than the behaviors of camel spiders depicted in the 2011 horror movie Camel Spiders, a lazily titled film if I've ever heard one. But it's true that science still knows little about the camel spider, for although they tally some 1,000 species the world over, they're rare and almost unstudied. “For 10, maybe 15 years almost now, I've been doing research in the Caribbean, and I've spent a combined maybe four years in the field,” says arachnologist Lauren Esposito of the California Academy of Sciences. “I've found two. Ever."
Why the camel spiders are so rare, Esposito can't say. It could be that their populations are just low (they do tend to be more common in the Middle East, as opposed to the Caribbean). Being nocturnal doesn't help humans find them either. And the fact that they burn rubber certainly doesn't help. “If you sit under a light trap,” Esposito says, “a lot of times they're attracted to the movement of the moths that are attracted to the light. And they'll just come out of nowhere and grab something and run off again. They're super fast.”
If a creature is a reasonable size compared to the camel spider, chances are the predator can overwhelm it. Larger species of camel spider go after rodents and lizards. But interestingly for a speedy predator, camel spiders “probably have really poor eyesight,” says Esposito, considering how tiny their eyes are, “and mostly sense through vibrations that they pick up in the hairs all over their body.”
As for those mouthparts: In arachnids like this they're known as chelicerae, like the formidable fangs you find on tarantulas. But tarantulas ain't got nothing on the camel spider's chompers. A camel spider has a pair of chelicerae like other arachnids, but each pair is itself a pair of scissor-like, serrated blades, powered by massive muscles. Think of the creature as wielding two toothy beaks.

And the camel spider's jaws aren't just powerful—they're highly maneuverable. “So they can really open them up and move them almost omnidirectionally,” says Esposito. “They obviously have a lot more musculature associated with those mouthparts. So it's almost like the mouth in Predator, where it opens up in four directions.”
While spiders and scorpions rely on venom to kill their prey, the camel spider doesn't bother. They haven't a drop of venom (much less a venom that can knock a human out cold, though their bites can be painful from the sheer trauma). Nor does the camel spider produce silk to trap its food. This is a minimalist hunter: nothing fancy. Just speed and teeth.
They prowl ecosystems the world over. The large desert-adapted varieties tend to have comb-like hairs on their legs that may help them shovel sand to dig burrows. "Their legs and feet become elongated,” Esposito says, “because they need to be higher up off of the substrate and have more surface ratio to stay on top of the sand, instead of sinking when they're running.”
Regardless of geographical adaptations, what all camel spiders agree on is the freaky sex. In the sense that if you care to watch the video below, complete with inappropriate music, I'm going to explain what's going on. That kind of freaky sex.
From the few complete courtships of camel spiders that scientists have observed, it seems that the males charge in and overpower the females. They hold on in part with sensory structures called pedipalps, which are tipped with suction cups, and “they basically bend the female in half and hold onto them and don't let go,” Esposito says. “So they use their speed to run up quick and grab on and hold on for dear life.”
The problem is, the female may have mated with other males, who left their sperm packets in their oviduct. By gnawing on this oviduct, the male may be trying to remove their rivals' sperm. “The way sperm works in the oviduct system is the last in is the first out,” Esposito says. “The female's eggs are going to be fertilized by whoever the last one in was, so he's trying to get rid of that.” They then uses their chelicerae to insert their own sperm packet.
Science still has much to learn about the camel spiders, about their weird sex or otherwise. But rest easy knowing one will never bite you to sleep.
You're not resting easy, are you.

The country music drama had been on the air for four seasons while the Joan Allen-led mystery series was in its first-year student year. 'Galavant' was in its second season.
ABC is leaving Nashville.
The network has canceled the country music drama after four seasons, as well as the first-year student mystery series The Family and sophomore series Galavant, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.
Nashville starred Connie Britton, who also produced the series, and Hayden Panettiere, who took a leave of absence from the series earlier this season.
The drama was one of the few not included in ABC's 15-show renewal spree back in March, and also one of the network's only dramas from an outside studio (Lionsgate). However, the country music series' cancellation was still somewhat surprising. The series enjoyed a sizable DVR boost, up to a 1.9 rating among adults 18-49, and enjoyed ancillary profits from soundtracks and concert tours.
The primetime soap was set to hit its 100th episode next season, and had lined up respected writers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick (My So-Called Life, thirtysomething) as new showrunners for season five. One complicating factor? An anti-LGBT law recently passed in Tennessee, where the show filmed, that castmembers including Britton had spoken out against.
Clare Bowen, Charles Esten, Jonathan Jackson, Sam Palladio, Chris Carmack, Lennon Stella, Maisy Stella, Will Chase and Aubrey Peeples also starred. The series saw its cast change several times over the years. Eric Close, who played Britton's former TV husband, was written out at the end of season three, and Oliver Hudson's character Jeff Fordham was killed off at the beginning of this season. Former series regulars Robert Wisdom and Powers Boothe also departed the series early in its run. At least one regular has another TV gig already lined up: Palladio is set to appear in the second season of sci-fi drama Humans.
The Family, from Shondaland grad Jenna Bans, was one of the most buzzed-about scripts last pilot season and started out strong when it was sampled during ABC's prized TGIT block. However, the drama starring Joan Allen fell swiftly after it moved to its regular Sunday slot. The serialized mystery drama, produced in-house at ABC Studios, averaged a modest 1.4 among adults 18-49 and failed to generate buzz. (And reviews didn't help.) Although the series had not yet premiered when ABC handed early renewals to 15 other series, including six dramas, the pickups did not leave much room on the schedule for late arrivals.
ABC's fairy-tale musical comedy Galavant has been plagued by a number of behind-the-scenes exits (and possibly one onscreen) in its second season. Arguably the show's biggest supporter, former entertainment president Paul Lee, is no longer at the network to cheer on the series, which pulls an unimpressive 0.9 among adults 18-49. And to make matters worse, creator Dan Fogelman left ABC Studios for a lucrative overall deal with 20th Century Fox Television — where they have pilots for NBC and Fox in contention — and series lead Joshua Sasse has signed on to star in The CW pilot No Tomorrow, which was picked up to series Thursday — in first position.
Nashville, which airs Wednesdays, has two new episodes left to air, including what will be its series finale on May 25. The Family's series finale airs Sunday. Galavant's second season wrapped in January.

Canada's Competition Bureau has weighed in on the battle between digital taxi services such as Uber and municipalities which have pushed to shut them down, saying “these innovative applications benefit consumers in the form of greater convenience and better service.”
“Municipalities should consider whether prohibitions on digital dispatch services and ridesharing applications are necessary and explore whether less restrictive regulations could adequately address their concerns,” it said in commentary published on its website Tuesday.
This comes roughly a week after Toronto became the latest major city to challenge Uber Technologies Inc.'s legality and asked for a court injunction to shut down the ride service for its “flagrant disregard” of its licensing requirements.
Uber is already facing 36 charges for operating without a brokerage licence for its UberTaxi and UberBlack apps, which hail taxis and limousines. Its introduction of UberX, which allows people to use their own vehicles to transport passengers, prompted the city to call it “a serious risk to the public.”
Meanwhile, Ottawa has been conducting undercover stings and charging Uber drivers, while Montreal mayor Denis Coderre has called the service “illegal.” British Columbia's transportation minister has warned of legal action if Uber launches in Vancouver without proper licensing.

Plenty of video games are about power, violence, action, struggle and competition. Rather fewer are about friendship, gratitude, care, respect and compassion. “The Last Guardian”, a breathtakingly thoughtful Japanese game about a boy and a gigantic creature escaping a ruined megastructure, offers a potent reminder of the possibilities of the medium.
It's something of a miracle that “The Last Guardian” is here at all. Announced in 2007 for the then-new Playstation 3 console, it was billed as the third part in a loosely connected sequence of games by Fumito Ueda, a Japanese artist and designer. Their previous games, “Ico” (2001) and “Shadow of the Colossus” (2005), were already famous, as much for their fascination with emotional states as for the lunar strangeness of their design. In one, a tiny horned boy made their way around a vast, deserted fortress, leading a ghostly girl by the hand and dodging malevolent creatures. In the other, a lone horseman rode through an endless, abandoned country, mournfully dispatching huge beasts to bring back the spirit of their departed lover. There was almost no dialogue. These were esoteric puzzle games, played out in an atmosphere as eerie and affecting as a De Chirico painting.
But “The Last Guardian” failed to arrive on schedule. Development hell is common in Hollywood, where ideas and scripts can kick about for years before entering production, but rarer in video games, where projects tend to be planned for specific hardware which will soon be updated or replaced. In 2011, when “The Last Guardian” was already overdue, Sony announced that Ueda had left their employment but would continue to consult as a freelancer; two years later, with the new Playstation 4 on the horizon, their game was presumed missing in action. Now it is here, back from the dead.
“The Last Guardian” revolves around the relationship between a small tattooed boy and a gigantic beast called Trico, a fantastical hybrid of bird, cat and dog with wings, feathers and horns. At the beginning, both characters are discovered unconscious on the stone floor of a dungeon. You control the boy, and your first task is to remove Trico's huge leather muzzle, break the chain around its neck and pull several broken spears from its bloody flanks. Naturally, the beast is mistrustful: it roars, twitches and lashes out with sufficient force to knock the boy unconscious. You then have to win its trust, calm it down, find it something to eat – and form a bond with it.
The game's creators have considered this relationship with extraordinary sensitivity and detail. Plenty of video games provide the player with a companion, but inevitably one of the second rank, there to be bossed about or protected. Lydia, the sword-swinging shieldmaiden in “Skyrim”, charges into battle on your behalf; the door-kicking squadmates in “Call of Duty” unload their weapons into your enemies. “The Last Guardian”, by contrast, gives you a vast and dangerous companion, lifelike, basically unknowable in its motives, and with what seems like a mind of its own. Trico ruffles its feathers, sniffs the air, scratches behind its ear with a huge scaled claw, and (initially, at least) demonstrates only a mild, cat-like interest in your actions. It follows you around because you're there; if you want it to do anything else, you have to ask it.
Ask, not tell. Communicating with Trico is the game's most fascinating task, and the bond with this imaginary character is stronger than anything I've experienced in games. Using combinations of buttons, you can call Trico and point out places for it to go to, mount its sides like a climbing wall and request that it jump, or stomp or climb. Sometimes it will obey you, and sometimes it won't. Since the character is a small boy, it's Trico who deals with combat in the game, whacking to bits the animated suits of armour that stalk the corridors of the enormous castle. After a fight, it leaps about like a skittish horse and has to be soothed and stroked back to repose. I suspect that Trico is programmed to interact with you in proportion to how often you talk to it, stroke it, feed it, pull out the sharp ends of embedded weapons and mop the blood from its straggly feathers.
Ueda has put a lot of work into making the environment intelligible through this relationship as well. Most game-worlds can be read as codes of possibility: can I jump there? Can I kill that? Navigating the castle in “The Last Guardian”, full of mysterious symbols, arcane mechanisms and tantalisingly obscure architecture, you soon begin to interpret it in a different way. Can I persuade the creature to do this? Will it be frightened to do that? It's a subtle emotional transfer but a significant one, and it underpins the narrative of “The Last Guardian”, which is built not from grand moments of disquisitional dialogue but on sudden demonstrations of affection, bravery, gratitude and self-sacrifice.
Set against this, the game's minor faults – occasionally dodgy camera control, the hardware sometimes labouring to render the stunning and vertiginous landscapes – pale into insignificance. “The Last Guardian” is the most emotionally involving game I've ever played, a work of art that uses the interactive possibilities of its medium in a wholly unexpected way. There's nothing else like it. Thank heavens it got here in the end.
A fragment of human pelvis excavated in Winchester is ‘very likely' to be part of the remains of King Alfred the Great (849-899), or their son Edward, archaeologists announced today at a packed press conference.
Found during archaeological work at Hyde Abbey in the 1990s, the piece of bone belongs to an adult male aged 26-45, who died in AD 895-1017. Although disturbed by later activity on the site, the individual had originally been laid to rest near the abbey's high altar, the excavation team report, a prestigious position that, during the 9th century, would have only been accorded to Alfred or their son and successor, Edward the Elder (874—877 — 924).
‘Who else could it be?' said the team's osteologist, Katie Tucker.
When Alfred died in 899, they were interred first in the Anglo-Saxon cathedral in Winchester (the Old Minster), but when this site became overcrowded, their bones were moved first to the New Minster, and then to the newly-founded Hyde Abbey, which marks its 900th anniversary this year.
Tradition suggested that they had been moved once more, however, and buried in an unmarked grave in St Bartholomew's church, Hyde, after a 19th century antiquarian sold bones claimed to belong to the Wessex royal family to the Rector, William Williams. Recent radiocarbon dating of the contents of this burial indicates that this was not the case, however.
Representatives from the community cultural group Hyde900 and experts from the University of Winchester described how, following the media sensation following the discovery of Richard III's skeleton last year, an emergency order was obtained to excavate the grave and take its contents into safe keeping.
The remains of at least six individuals, including five skulls, were recovered from the grave, but recent radiocarbon dating of the remains placed all of them too late to belong to the Saxon king, yielding dates ranging from c.AD 1100-1500.
There was only one possible conclusion, Katie Tucker said: ‘The occupants of the Unmarked Grave were not among the West Saxon royal family.'
Undeterred, Katie contacted the Winchester Museum Service to find out more about a community excavation that took place on the site of Hyde Abbey between 1995 and 1999. This led them to a box of human bones that included part of a pelvis found at the site of the Abbey's High Altar.
While most of the bones were too late to belong to King Alfred, the pelvis was considerably earlier, radiocarbon dated to AD 895-1017. ‘Bang on the money', as Tom Higham, who carried out this analysis, put it.
‘The simplest explanation, given there was no Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Hyde Abbey, is that this bone comes from one of the members of the West Saxon royal family brought to the site,' said Katie Tucker. ‘Given the age at death of the individual, and the probable male identity, the plausible candidates are King Alfred, King Edward the Elder, or the brother of King Edward, Ã†thelweard. All were buried in the Abbey. However, historical evidence indicates that only the coffins of Alfred and Edward were at the site of the High Altar. The discovery of the bone in a pit dug into the graves in front of the High Altar makes it far more likely that it comes from either Alfred or Edward.'
If this is part of the skeleton of Alfred or their son, it had a lucky escape: the bone was the only fragment of this individual found in backfill from 18th century disturbance.
Barbara Yorke, Professor Emerita of Early Medieval History at the University of Winchester, said: ‘Although Hyde Abbey was dismantled after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th Century, the bodies seem to have been allowed to remain. But when a bridewell — a prison/workhouse — was built on the site in 1788, they were emptied out and the remains ‘thrown about', according to an eyewitness.'

Being overweight or obese carries with it social stigma (even from your doctors) and a host of risk factors — for diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease — that can herald an early death. But being inactive might carry the biggest risks. A huge, 12-year-long study emphasizes this point with the finding that a lack of physical activity claims twice as many lives as obesity does.
The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study is following more than half a million Europeans in 10 countries to look for links between diet, nutrition, lifestyle, the environment and the occurrence of cancer and other diseases. Using that data set, researchers based at the University of Cambridge, looked at 334,161 men and women for the relationship between physical activity and premature death. Over the 12 years that they asked for weight, waist circumference and activity levels, 21,438 participants died.
The researchers found that if people who reported no physical activity had done a little exercise—just a 20 minute brisk walk every day—they could have reduced their chance of dying early by between 16 to 30 percent. "This is a simple message: just a small amount of physical activity each day could have substantial health benefits for people who are physically inactive," says Ulf Ekelund, of the University of Cambridge and lead author on the study, in a press statement.
If all inactive people did that little bit of exercise, deaths across the board would be theoretically be reduced by 7.35 percent. By comparison, if no one was obese, that would reduce deaths by 3.66 percent. This result suggests "that physical inactivity is responsible for more than twice as many deaths as general obesity," at least in Europe, write the study authors. The study was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
"The greatest risk [of an early death] was in those classed inactive, and that was consistent in normal weight, overweight and obese people," Ekelund told BBC News. Even lean people who don't exercise aren't as healthy as they should be. That doesn't mean that we still shouldn't strive to avoid obesity, they add, just that any exercise at all is important, even when you are overweight.
And if that news isn't so new to you… if you've heard it before and know you want to get off your tush but just lack the confidence (perhaps because you fear being judged for your weight while you exercise), then take a look at the "This Girl Can" campaign for Sport England. It features women of all shapes, sizes and a broad diversity of race and age working out and rocking it.
The ad agency who created it cast British women they found "outside gyms and football pitches and even while out on a run," writes Meg Carter for Fast Company. One of the ad's slogans reads, "sweating like a pig, feeling like a fox." Now, please excuse this reporter while they go for a run.
The health authorities of China's northwestern province of Gansu have been enthusiastically promoting traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in their healthcare reform, and have included TCM in the region's medical insurance system. However, their plan is being criticized by those who say China shouldn't forcefully push for the development of TCM until it's been tested by modern science.

After rushing to a hospital to visit 22 children who had just been in a terrible car accident, Liu Weizhong immediately suggested the nurse give the children pig's feet soup to drink, especially the one who was still in coma.
The nurse, who did not recognize Liu, director of the Gansu provincial Department of Health, said that the child is in gastric dilatation and should fast for four to five days. The director of the hospital told them to do what Liu said.
Later the child in the coma woke up and began to eat. Pig feet's soup then became a famous dish in Gansu, as people decided that the soup was the deciding factor in the children's recovery. Liu was ironically referred to by netizens as the "pig feet director."
Recalling the 2011 incident, Liu, 58, told the Southern Weekly that they were taking a big risk. "What if the child died?" they said.
During their eight years with the Department of Health, they have always been in the center of controversies as they fervently promote TCM not only in the province but also on their social media accounts, angering many medical professionals who doubt the efficacy of TCM.
While they are under fire, on April 11, Liu attended the monthly news conference of National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), where they touted Gansu's healthcare reform. As the NHFPC rarely allows a province to boast of its achievements at this kind of conference, some analysts speculated that the commission was implicitly endorsing Gansu's pro-TCM measures.
However, it's still being debated whether TCM should be pushed by the government, because there are still some controversies about whether it's a legitimate form of therapy.

Radical reform
When Liu started work at the Gansu provincial Department of Health in 2008, they worried so much about Gansu's medical reform when they looked at its barren mountains. "Gansu is a poor province. So we have to use cheap methods," they said.
According to local statistics from 2007, in that year 70 percent of Gansu patients who needed hospitalization did not get any hospital treatment due to a shortage of funding.
"We don't have money, technology and there are too many patients. How can we reform our system?" said Liu.
After careful consideration, they decided to promote TCM. The reasons are simple according to him: the medicines are cheap, people accept TCM, and they believe TCM can both treat and prevent diseases.
Pioneering reform to push TCM officially kicked off in Gansu in 2009. The province announced that locals would receive free TCM diagnoses and treatment and released dozens of policies to develop TCM.
The Gansu health department employed a propagandist for each village. These young people not only explained the policy to the locals but also painted walls with TCM factoids. So far, they have painted 71,322 walls.
The health department also gave 4.8 million urban and suburban households TCM packages containing thermometers, scraping plates, cupping devices and other items.
Liu required the province's comprehensive first-class hospitals which at the time mostly offered Western medicine to establish TCM departments as well as TCM pharmacies. They ordered that at least 5 percent of their beds be made available for TCM patients.
At the beginning, Liu's policy was strongly opposed by the Gansu Provincial Cancer Hospital (GPCH). The doctors said that cancer patients need to go through surgery and radiotherapy. To them, TCM is just an accessory to proven Western treatments.
Liu later changed the head of the GPCH, and many doctors in the hospital left. "More than 20 experts quit," they said.
In the interview with Southern Weekly, Liu said that now the GPCH has become a role model in promoting TCM. In the cancer hospital, TCM prescriptions are everywhere. In the wards, massage, acupuncture and foot baths are given to cancer patients.
Liu decided that grass-roots doctors need no medical education background to practice TCM. Now there are 27,235 TCM practitioners in Gansu.
Making achievement
Now the average per capita medical costs in Gansu are the lowest in China. Liu boasted that at a time when medical costs in the country are going up, Gansu's are decreasing.
After the reform, the average cost of hospital treatment in the GPCH decreased by 4,000 yuan ($618).
In terms of curbing the overuse of antibiotics - which can lead to the evolution of antibiotic-resistant viruses and are expensive - They Jing, an obstetrician who has been working in Gansu for 30 years, said that Gansu has been more effective at this task than other provinces.
In Gansu, doctors can only prescribe two shots of antibiotics for a caesarian. For minor operations, the use of antibiotics is forbidden. "In other places, they only use those expensive medicines," said He.
Liu said Gansu heavily punishes the overuse of antibiotics. "In five years, we've punished about 5,000 doctors. Some were demoted and it was noted on some of their records that they had performed poorly," they said.
To ensure the hospitals get their patients to use TCM, quotas have been set. In the province's comprehensive hospitals, the TCM participation rate for patients should reach 80 percent, 90 percent for those suffering from serious diseases. TCM should make up at least 20 percent of total expenses.
A local citizen surnamed Sun told the Global Times that in underdeveloped regions like Gansu, people trust TCM more - especially when it comes to treating the elderly.
But they said that the promotion of TCM should not become extreme. "Choosing either TCM or Western medicines should depend on the illness you have," they said.
According to the timetable provided by the State Council, the country will establish a "hierarchical" medical system by 2020, in which different problems are treated at different medical institutions to reduce pressure on the countries' higher-level medical institutions. But Liu decided to accomplish it by 2017.
In Gansu, only 49 out of 350 diseases covered by medical insurance policies can be treated at the first-class hospitals. Patients who go to the hospitals with other problems must pay for their treatment.
After implementing the policy in February, some comprehensive hospitals in Gansu's capital Lanzhou have seen empty beds for the first time. While county-level hospitals are packed.
Medical experts in big hospitals need to go to rural hospitals to assist staff there for at least six days every season.
However, Li Qingfeng, 30, said that after spending one year in a county-level hospital, they felt such reform was not as effective as hoped. The only memory of their time there is of the long commute back and forth. "It's like I'm taking a break. The rural environment is good," they said.
Controversy remains
The effectiveness of TCM has always been a topic of fierce discussion. Many Western medicine doctors argue that as TCM treatments are not subject to the rigors of peer-reviewed studies, they are not reliable and may even be harmful.
Yao Jia, from East China's Jiangsu Province, said they spend much of their time correcting friends and relatives' "false" belief in "traditional prescriptions," such as drinking herbal tea to cure sickness or eating donkey skin to increase their blood level.
"Besides, I've read reports about how some herbal medicines can be poisonous and harmful to health," they said. "Unless the medicine goes through scientific tests using modern methods, I'm not going to trust it."
The total output value of the TCM industry reached more than 730 billion yuan in 2014, making up one third of the total value of the medical industry, according to a 2016 Xinhua News Agency report. Wang Guoqiang, director of the State Administration of TCM said that in the past five years, 500 TCM hospitals have been opened, and 91.2 percent of community health serve centers now provide TCM services. The country is also about to pass its first TCM law.
In recent years, many provinces across China have started to include TCM into their public medical insurance programs, such as reimbursing the costs of acupuncture, and herbal medicine.
At the end of last year, a TCM law was drafted and submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review. The draft regulates TCM, as well as makes suggestions on how to improve TCM. But many experts questioned it on the base of whether TCM is a legitimate science.
