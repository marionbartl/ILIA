Former FBI Director James Comey recently went public with the fact that they had secretly been documenting uncomfortable encounters they had with President Trump prior to their termination. In one such alleged memo, Comey is said to have documented a clandestine conversation with Trump where they asked them to drop the investigation against former General Flynn. Comey's memos have not yet been released to the public. However, while it does not necessarily reveal incriminating information about the President, one leaked memo has surfaced, detailing some very disturbing supervisory practices of President Trump toward their Press Secretary Sean Spicer.
Memo Details Below:
In the memorandum, Comey explained that they were meeting with President Trump and White House Intelligence officials for a routine daily briefing. Comey did not detail what was discussed in the meeeting; rather, they wrote to document the peculiar way Trump was treating Sean Spicer.
At one point in the memo, Comey explained that Trump summoned Spicer into the Oval Office by peeking their head out the door, patting their thigh repeatedly and yelling, “Sean! Here boy! Come here, Sean. That's a good boy!” After which, they allegedly closed the door in their face and tried to share a laugh at Spicer's expense. Comey described this as “disturbing” and “humiliating.”
Later, Comey detailed that the President opened the door to to find Spicer still standing outside, staring at the ground, seemingly dejected. Comey wrote, “the President then tousled Mr. Spicer's hair, and said ‘oh Sean, you take things too seriously. Grab us some coffee and come have a seat.'”
The alleged mistreatment of the Press Secretary did not stop there. After sending Mr. Spicer back to the kitchen for “fresher coffee,” the President briefed Spicer on what they wanted to relay to the media regarding the tensions with North Korea at the time the memo was written. Trump allegedly stated, “I hired you for your mouth, Sean. Don't mess this up, because aside from your mouth, I'm not sure what else you're good for.” Comey detailed that the President looked around the room chuckling, as if they were “looking for confirmation.” In Comey's estimation, nobody was amused but the President.
Comey also found it worthwhile to note that Spicer seemed very tense during this entire encounter. At one point in the memo, Comey explained that “… while [the President] was standing next to Mr. Spicer, they reached up to scratch their own head while reading a document, and Mr. Spicer noticeably flinched as if they felt the President was going to slap him.”
The entire tone of Comey's leaked memo is that of a concerned witness to a very awkward working relationship. While NewsWerthy cannot confirm the authenticity of this leaked memo, it certainly brings to light some insight into the true demeanor of the President when they are behind closed doors. If true, these allegations also serve to explain why Sean Spicer seems so aggressive while addressing the press in routine conferences, rather than adhering to successful past practices of simply creating a good rapport with the media.
Uber is banned across Germany, at least for now. It emerged on Tuesday that the Frankfurt Regional Court imposed a preliminary injunction on Uber last week, ahead of a full court case over the service's legality.
As the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported, the court said [company]Uber[/company] was illegal because its drivers do not carry the appropriate permits and insurance. Uber said it will fight the injunction, for which taxi industry body Taxi Deutschland had applied, and will not shut down in the meantime.

Uber has already had some success in similar circumstances in Hamburg and Berlin, where it got different courts to suspend the injunctions ahead of full court hearings. The company sort of won its Hamburg case last week – the court overturned that ban on the grounds that it was issued by the wrong city agency, but it also said that Uber's drivers were “probably” acting illegally because they don't have proper licenses, and that Uber itself was also likely breaking the law.
Uber maintains that its drivers are not its employees, and while the Berlin ban was briefly in place it refused to promise to pay those drivers' potential fines. No drivers were fined in that period of several days between the injunction's imposition and its suspension, but if the authorities had caught them ferrying passengers they would have lost up to €20,000 ($26,270) each time.
This time around, the stakes are much higher. Each illicit journey could cost up to €250,000, and Uber's directors could also face jail. That's a problem when they're supposed to be aggressively expanding operations in Germany.
“Germany is one of the fastest growing markets for Uber in Europe,” Uber said in a statement. “We will continue to operate in Germany and will appeal the recent lawsuit filed by Taxi Deutschland in Frankfurt. We believe innovation and competition is good for everyone, riders and drivers, everyone wins… Uber will continue its operations and will offer Uberpop ridesharing services via its app throughout Germany.?”?
As for Taxi Deutschland, the association said driver and consumer protection laws cannot be easily overturned by a “neoliberal company” like Uber. It went on to accuse Uber of using its “billions of cash from Goldman Sachs and Google” to try to “overrun the market” while disguising itself as a “new economy savior.” Entertainingly, it also made reference to the “locust shareconomy.”
“An internet rating is intended to replace a proper examination by authorities?” asked Taxi Germany chairperson Dieter Schlenker, referring to Germany's laws around taxi roadworthiness and insurance.
By way of analysis, I'll just sum up what I've said before. Perhaps the rules need changing, but it is deeply unfair to expect traditional cab drivers, who have paid dearly for their licenses with both training time and money, to just roll over when a new operation comes to town, pretending that the rules simply don't apply.
German cab drivers aren't resistant to change – they work with apps like Taxi.eu — but they're right to demand a level regulatory playing field, and the authorities are right to try to give it to them. In the meantime, the authorities should also be making sure that the playing field remains suitable for a range of different business models while protecting both passengers and their drivers.

I had just come in from picking bell peppers when I read the news of Walmart's pledge to buy at least nine percent locally-raised foods by the year 2015. Perhaps I should have been heartened, since this represents potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in market for local farmers around the nation and world. Instead, the announcement sent me back to the pepper patch, shaking my head and wondering if this wasn't the beginning of the end of the local food movement.
The organic produce we raise -- on what used to be a tobacco farm here in Appalachian Virginia -- goes to our local farmers market, to a handful of restaurants, and to independent supermarkets in Virginia, Tennessee and neighboring states. While we're one of the biggest producers at the Abingdon farmers market, our farm's sales are but a small part of the produce and eggs reaching the shelves of several hundred supermarkets through a farmer-based network called Appalachian Harvest. Developed as a partnership with these regionally-based grocers, Appalachian Harvest has helped small growers reach large markets while securing a pretty good price for their peppers, tomatoes and other items.
Sometimes referred to as value chains, other times called "food hubs," coordinated, cooperative networks of farmers closely linked to regional markets are emerging in many parts of the country. The farmers in these networks are typically small to medium scale, often employing organic or sustainable practices; the buyers are diverse, from restaurants to public schools, universities and retailers. These food hubs, while relatively new, are beginning to take hold, improving the livelihoods of farmers and bringing fresher, healthier foods to many segments of rural and urban communities. In the process, they are also building the knowledge, relationships and infrastructure -- the "community capital" - essential to make farms more viable, food more secure and communities more vibrant and resilient.
How would Walmart fit into this emerging healthy local food system? If experience is our guide, not well at all. The purported greening of Walmart notwithstanding, the core of its business model continues to be market domination of all competitors and cheaply priced goods made possible by poor employee wages and very low prices paid to suppliers. Just ask the Vlasic Pickles company. Or Rubbermaid, or The Loveable. All three welcomed the opportunity to sell to Walmart, relinquishing other markets in order to meet the company's volume demand. But after just a few years, they found the terms of their agreements changing and the prices paid dropping. All three went out of business. If multimillion dollar companies like Rubbermaid and Vlasic can be brought to their knees by the retail behemoth, how should we expect small farmers to fare? Over the past decade, investigations of Walmart and other giant retailers in the United Kingdom and Mexico uncovered considerable evidence that suppliers were strong-armed, for example by insisting on volume price discounts even when orders were small. These practices led the Mexican Federal Competition Commission to order Walmart to adopt a Code of Conduct for its dealing with vendors, while Britain's Competition Commission developed new regulations for dealing with suppliers.
If this sounds like progress towards fairer transactions with farmers and other suppliers, think again. In October, 2009, The Independent uncovered a secret memo from top brass at Asda, owned by Walmart, instructing its buyers to take advantage of its market dominance, recognizing that "suppliers are hungry for volume" and to therefore "buy for less." The memo suggested playing "good cop, bad cop" in order to extract payments and concessions from suppliers, including helping to pay for the retailer's costs related to marketing and waste. According to the Credit Research Foundation, this is part of a larger pattern, pioneered by Walmart, to push many of their costs down the supply chain using "charge backs" that cost suppliers as much as 10 percent of their total sales.
Let's be honest: Walmart's entry into organic and sustainable foods is, like everything else they do, all about market share, including the image repair needed to maintain their dominance. It seems misguided that major environmental organizations are enabling Walmart to achieve this end. As Stacy Mitchell, author of Big Box Swindle says, "How is it that activists for the public good are no longer troubled, but actually pleased about, huge concentrations of economic power?"
And that really is the bottom line. Nearly every sector of the U.S economy, certainly including food and agriculture, is increasingly concentrated, dominated by a smaller and smaller group of ever larger, place-less corporations. The local food economy has emerged as a small but rapidly growing exception, where farmers, consumers, and a range of locally rooted grocers and other markets have been diversifying local economies and revitalizing local communities. Demand for local foods from these close-to-home markets far exceeds supply in most places. The last thing local farmers, or the communities they serve need is to abandon these markets and throw their lot in with a root-less and ruthless giant.

Vision Vancouver's Patti Bacchus has been ousted as the chair of the Vancouver School Board and been replaced by newly-elected NPA trustee Christopher Richardson.
The change comes after Vision Vancouver lost control of the school board during the November civic elections, which saw the election of four Vision trustees, four NPA trustees and one Green trustee.
Bacchus was re-elected, but they did not hold on to their position as chair at a meeting Monday night.
They have been the chair since 2008, when they were first elected as a trustee. Under their tenure, the board has opened its first Aboriginal-focused school of choice and an early Mandarin bilingual program, and expanded the Montessori programming and the first primary International Baccalaureate Program.

Richardson, the newly elected board chair, was the last of nine trustees to be voted in during the election last month.
They promised to improve school resources for students with learning issues during the campaign.
According to their campaign bio, Richardson is a chartered accountant and has served three times as a Vancouver Park Board Commissioner.
Nelle Harper Lee, who won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961 for their book, "To Kill a Mockingbird," has died at the age of 89, multiple sources in their hometown of Monroeville confirmed Friday morning.
Lee was born April 28, 1926, in Monroeville, the youngest of four children of lawyer Amasa Coleman Lee and Frances Cunningham Finch Lee.
As a child, Lee attended elementary school and high school just a few blocks from their house on Alabama Avenue. In a March 1964 interview, they offered this capsule view of their childhood: "I was born in a little town called Monroeville, Alabama, on April 28, 1926. I went to school in the local grammar school, went to high school there, and then went to the University of Alabama. That's about it, as far as education goes."
They moved to New York in 1949, where they worked as an airlines reservations clerk while pursuing a writing career. Eight years later, Lee submitted their manuscript for "To Kill a Mockingbird" to J.B. Lippincott & Co., which asked them to rewrite it.
On July 11, 1960, Lee's novel was published by Lippincott with critical and commercial success. The author won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction the following year.
The film adaptation of the novel, with Mary Badham as Scout, opened on Christmas Day of 1962 and was an instant hit.
Harper Lee suffered a stroke in 2007, recovered and resumed their life in the hometown where they spent many of their 89 years. A guardedly private individual, Lee was respected and protected by residents of the town that displays Mockingbird-themed murals and each year stages theatrical productions of "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Lee returned to Monroeville for good once their sister Alice became ill and needed help. She'd eat breakfast each morning at the same fast-food place, and could later be seen picking up Alice from the law firm founded by their father.
Services for Lee have not been announced.
The 606 Bloomingdale Trail had more than 1 million visitors last year. View Full Caption DNAinfo/Alisa Hauser
BUCKTOWN — The 606's Bloomingdale Trail — a 2.7-mile-long elevated path that runs through four Chicago neighborhoods— has proven the adage: If you build it, they will come.
Last year, 1.6 million people used the trail, and those numbers are "trending up" by 15 percent this year, according to Adriana Diaz, a spokesperson for The Trust for Public Land, the city's public-private partner that manages the park system for the Chicago Park District.
The trail opened on June 6, 2015, and in late December of that year, the U.S. Forest Service installed infrared counters on the west and east ends of the path to track trail use, Diaz said.
Diaz said The Trust for Public Land is "very happy" with the numbers.
"We are thrilled with the community using the trail and the whole park system," they said.
The technology used is not sophisticated enough to determine how many of the 1.6 million 606 trail users were repeat visitors.
Part of a larger Park District system, the 606 gets its name from the first three numbers of the ZIP code all Chicagoans share. The trail runs along a former train line from Bucktown and Wicker Park on the east to Logan Square and Humboldt Park on the west.
Four of the access points to the trail are ground-level parks: Walsh Park, 1722 N. Ashland Ave.; Churchill Park, 1825 N. Damen Ave.; Julia de Burgos Park, 1805 N. Albany Ave.; and Park 567, 1805 N. Milwaukee Ave. Eight other access points are ramps.
Last year, the 606 won a national award from the American Planning Association, which described the park system as "a stunning example of a community working together to realize a dream and create a citywide attraction from underused city infrastructure."

“People like to believe in fairy tales. Don't let it be forgotten, that for one brief, shining moment, there was a Camelot.”
Natalie Portman's Jackie Kennedy repeats this mantra often to people throughout Pablo Larraín's film Jackie; a film unlike any other that captures the feeling of an important moment in American history like lightning in a bottle. Terrific performances, a beautifully claustrophobic sense of feeling, a pitch perfect screenplay, and masterful direction help create a poignant and personal portrait of the once First Lady. Rarely has anyone humanized an iconic, almost mythical person, as successfully as Pablo Larraín has here.
We begin with seeing Jackie in their New England home, giving an interview with a journalist played by Billy Crudup. They recall the events of the assassination of their husband, John F. Kennedy, and everything that happened afterwards. The film goes back-and-forth with ease through the moments they remember; recording a TV special about living in the White House, the day of the assassination, and planning JFK's funeral. These flashbacks are shot in handheld style with several close-ups, while the interview sequences are shot in a stable, static mode. This aesthetic decision helps show how Jackie had a shaky grasp of power during disastrous times, but as the film progresses things become stable, cementing Jackie's power and dominance (What annoys me is when people complain when a filmmaker doesn't have a specific reason to how they filmed something. Filmmakers don't have to explain everything in their film to you, and that's what I loved about it).
Larraín's direction feels incredibly endearing and humanistic, especially when Jackie is all alone and only has their thoughts to herself. The scene where she's in a bathroom cleaning off the blood of JFK after the assassination is a great, haunting example of this. It's always hard to view the Kennedys as anything other than icons, which screenwriter Noah Oppenheim deconstructs so well in this film. Jackie Kennedy is the gatekeeper that helped keep the mythos and legacy of the Kennedys alive. They know that they are the last hope for their husband to be remembered through all history, but they have to also be a motherly figure, to comfort their children who will never see their father alive again. In those moments, Jackie becomes a film not only about legacy, but also one of trauma and grief captured magnificently by Natalie Portman.
I believe that Natalie Portman deserves every single award that they get for this film. Jackie feels made for Portman, as it is not only the best performance of 2016, but the best performance of their career. There are so many scenes that broke my heart and I never once thought of them as an actor. When she's seeing both of their dead children being buried next to their deceased husband I wanted to cry. Portman's face is one that could tell you a million stories just with a glance; I felt like I was watching Jackie Kennedy throughout the entire runtime.
I figured Portman would be amazing but I was truly shocked at the supporting actors, specifically Peter Sarsgaard as Robert F. Kennedy. They showed a lot of depth, especially in the weakness that RFK had in that situation. One great scene is where they and Jackie discuss the legacy JFK will leave, of how they will probably only be remembered for ending a war they started, and they'll only be known as the “Pretty Family”. It's a scene that captures the Kennedys in their most dire moment, and Jackie the only one that can pick up the pieces. Greta Gerwig is also great with the limited amount of screen time they have, but each character has their purpose and supports Jackie and helps flesh them out in their own little way. I'd also like to add that the actor playing John F. Kennedy freaks me out because they look scarily similar to JFK to the point where you'd think the filmmakers used some next generation CGI to bring them to the screen.
What really lifts this above most biopics is the cinematography by Stéphane Fontaine, and the score by Mica Levi. While they are two separate aspects of the film, they both add significant layers of dimension and elevate the overall quality of the overall film. I wasn't a fan of Fontaine's cinematography in Paul Verhoeven's Elle, but their decisions here make Jackie one of the best productions shot on film since Carol. I was extremely impressed with how they shot the White House tour and with how authentic it looked to the actual black-and-white footage; their team got it down exactly from the angle of their head to their body movements. Fontaine's most impressive shots however, are during the funeral where all you see is Jackie in a sea filled with mourning Americans. It's also in this moment where Mica Levi's score is also used to perfect effect. While I still prefer Levi's score for Under the Skin, this was beautiful on its own, capturing the sense of tragedy from just using a single instrument in some cases. What makes Jackie's score even more gracious is when it shows the mood and thoughts of Jackie in certain scenes. During scenes in the motorcade the music would be loud and gregarious, showing the devastating emotions of Jackie in that moment. This might be the best score of 2016 next to Moonlight, and we need more films to be scored by Mica Levi.
In short, Jackie is one of those films that I can definitely say will change how biopics are made, as it's one of the most formally ambitious of the subgenre since perhaps Nicolas Winding Refn's Bronson. With beautiful cinematography, a gorgeous and haunting score, and the best performance of 2016, it's not just a towering achievement, but by far the best film I've seen all year.

WINTER GARDEN, Fla. - A 17-year-old West Orange High School student was arrested Wednesday about two hours after a 15-year-old classmate was shot in the face during a fight on campus, according to Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings.
[PICS: Scene | VIDEO: Local 6 questions suspect | MORE: Sign up for alerts | Download Local 6 apps]
The Orange County Sheriff's Office said J-Morian Eddie Patrick Bell was arrested in the shooting of Ja'Roderick Smith, who was wounded around 1:15 p.m. in the bus loop at the high school, located on Beulah Road in Winter Garden just south of the Florida Turnpike. The shooting took place after classes ended Wednesday, which is an early dismissal day.
Bell was detained near the intersection of Coscester Street and Massey Avenue in west Orange County. Local 6 questioned Bell about the shooting as they were being taken to the Orange County Jail, and they replied, "I've got nothing to say to nobody."
Bell faces four charges, including attempted murder, aggravated battery with a firearm, possession of a firearm by a juvenile and possession of a firearm on school property.
Orange County Public Schools spokesperson Kathy Marsh said Smith was alert before they were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center. Officials said they were in stable condition.
Demings said they spoke to Smith and that they and their family were in good spirits.
Superintendent Barbara Jenkins said Smith had just transferred back to West Orange and it was their first day back at the school. The ninth-grader had switched back from Olympia High, but it's not clear why they transferred.
A witness told Local 6 the shooting started as a fight and ended when one of them was shot in the upper body.
"We're just walking and I turn around and there's a fight and one of them pulls a gun out and shoots him," said witness Austin Nornhold. "I saw them take the gun out and shoot him. I left right after that because I didn't want any trouble."
"(Smith) was shot in the face and the abdomen," said Demings, who stated earlier that about 100 law enforcement officers responded to the school.
"He was conscious. They were moving around," Nornhold said. "He was grabbing their head like they were pretty hurt."
Demings said school officials administered first aid to Smith before they were taken to the hospital.
Video from Local 6 News helicopter Sky 6 showed about a dozen law enforcement vehicles at the school, with a portion of the bus loop blocked off with police tape. Deputies were seen removing students from several buses and searching each vehicle before allowing the children back on board.
School officials said the students were bused to Ocoee High School at 1925 Ocoee Crown Point Parkway, where parents picked them up.
"We are exercising extreme caution with your children because safety is our first priority," Orange County Public Schools said in a phone message sent to parents.
The West Orange High School principal also posted a message to parents on the school's Facebook page.
"Good afternoon, parents. This is Douglas Szcinski, principal at WOHS. Our school is now on lockdown. We are following all safety procedures and precautions.
"There has been an incident in which one student was shot. That student is alert and is being transported to the hospital. Law enforcement is on the scene working the situation."
It's not clear why the fight broke out and the Orange County Sheriff's Office continues to investigate the shooting. School will be in session on Thursday with heightened security and counselors on hand for any students who need to talk about the shooting.
OCPS said they will continue to conduct random metal-detection screenings of all students and staff.
Meanwhile, the shooting forced officials to cancel the West Orange High basketball games Wednesday night against Dr. Phillips High School.

BREAKING: Cargo ship destroyed during launch to space station - Russian space agency on Twitter — Reuters Tech News (@ReutersTech) December 1, 2016
The spacecraft successfully lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan just after 9:50AM EST this morning, carrying nearly three tons of food, fuel and supplies for the Expedition 50 crew. However, it ran into telemetry issues, which NASA is categorizing as "an anomaly", during the third stage of the mission -- roughly six and a half minutes into the flight. Russia's Roscosmos agency has been monitoring the situation and has confirmed that the mission has failed. According to a statement from NASA, "the Russians have formed a State Commission and are the source for details on the specific failure cause."
This mission was the third and final Russian resupply mission to the ISS of the year. The space station still has plenty of supplies, according to NASA, so there isn't much danger of the crew starving in the immediate future. Furthermore, Japan's JAXA is planning to launch an H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-6 flight to the ISS on December 9th.
Australian Vic Secret on Rye
As soon I as noticed Yakima Valley Hops had hops available from the 2015 hop crop, I purchased four different hop varieties on a whim. I decided to brew four separate single dry hopped beers with each of the varieties to get a true unblended picture of each of the hops individual aromatic abilities. All of the beers have been brewed to date, the first of which was a delicious session IPA dry hopped with 100% AU Galaxy. The second is a hoppy low ABV session IPA brewed with 100% AU Vic Secret and 18% organic flaked rye.
AU Vic Secret is a fairly new hop first being commercially available in 2013. AU Vic Secret shares the same mother as Topaz. Yakima Valley Hops describes the hop as having pineapple, pine, passion fruit flavors/aromas that are lighter than the ones you will find in Galaxy hops. Running the hops oil numbers through my database of hops resulted in AU Vic Secret being the most similar to Summit. This surprised me because I've always thought of Summit as being a dank onion type of hop (having never brewed with it), but YCH HOPS does describe Summit as having some fruitier characteristics as well as spicy and earthy notes, which does somewhat look like AU Vic Secret's descriptors. Below is a side-by-side comparison of the two hops by hop oil compositions and descriptors:

My very first impression of this hop was that it reminded me of a lot of a beer I made singled dry hopped with Eureka (then called Experimental Pine Fruit), which was a solid beer that actually advanced to the final round of last year's national homebrew competition. I didn't have any more of this particular beer left so I couldn't do a proper side-by-side of the two beers, but because it kept reminding me of the Eureka APA, I looked at the hop oil makeup of Eureka to compare with AU Vic Secret to see if I was crazy. Sure enough, the hops are very similar.
AU Vic Secret | Eureka
Linalool: 0.40% | 0.40%
Myrcene: 39.50% | 43.00%
Caryophyllene: 13.00% | 14.20%
Farnesene: 0.50% | 0.20%
Hummulene: 16.50% | 29.80%
I described the Eureka beer with descriptors such as pine, sap, fruity, cherry popsicle, resin, and green sprees. I described this AU Vic Secret beer as slightly more earthy/vegetal than fruity. Little bit of a hop spice character. The fruity aspects of the aroma reminded me most pineapple (core), peaches, green fruit loops (candied fruits) with a strawberry sweetness quality to the aroma. Both beers had a “green” aspect to them to my nose (green sprees and green fruit loops). But overall piney, spicy, and fruity is a great way to describe both hops. The commercial description mentions the hop as being similar but lighter to Galaxy, I'd disagree with this characterization. To me Galaxy has a delicate fresh peach aroma where AU Vic Secret is much more aggressive.
Body wise, the beer was a little thin. I don't seem to get a lot of body when using large amounts of flaked rye like I do when using something like flaked oats, even when it's nearly 20% of the grain build! Maybe a little carapils or even a half pound of wheat or spelt flour would have helped the body a little. Head retention was OK, but nothing to brag about. There was virtually no noticeable alcohol presence in this beer, which might be helping bring out hop flavor even more. The idea being that the aftertaste isn't being dominated by alcohol warmth.
The water profile was inspired by a recent BYO article where Firestone Walker considered Pivo Pils a “malty” beer that only had calcium chloride added. Since I'm already joining the less gypsum movement, I decided to give this 100% calcium chloride concept a try. Overall, I'm not sure it made that much of a difference from when I brew with a ratio of 1:1 (gypsum:calcium chloride). I would definitely consider the mouthfeel soft in this beer (which is what I'm usually after), but I really didn't think much of the water profile while enjoying the beer.
Overall this beer was really enjoyable! There is definitely enough complexity to this hop to stand on it's own in a single hopped beer. There was a lot of hop flavor in this beer, which I'm guessing has something to do with AU Vic Secret's high total oil content of 2.5 ml/100g. Just like with El Dorado (which also has a high total oil amount), I got a lot of that saturated oily hop flavor. I'm starting to think I should be using these high total oil hops in the flameout stages of brewing in an attempt to get the most oils making it all the way through the fermentation process.
Demand has soared since 2002 law that made it legal, fuelled by postwar generation with clear idea on how to shape their lives, and deaths
The number of people euthanised in the Netherlands this year is set to exceed 7,000 – a 67% rise from five years ago – in what has been described by the director of the country's only specialist clinic as the end of “a taboo” on killing patients who want to die.
In 2012, 4,188 people were euthanised by doctors in the country, all of whom met the criteria laid down under the 2002 law that made it legal: a voluntary and well considered request in the context of unbearable suffering from which there is no prospect of improvement, or alternative remedy.
This year, 18,000 requests for help to die have been made, including 2,500 – up from 1,234 in 2015 – to the Levenseindekliniek – the only medical facility in the Netherlands that specialises in euthanasia.
The clinic is a charity whose costs are covered by a standard Dutch health insurance policy.
Steven Pleiter, director at the clinic, said that in response to growing demand they were now on a recruitment drive aimed at doubling the number of doctors and nurses on their books willing to go into people's homes to administer lethal injections to patients with conditions ranging from terminal illnesses to crippling psychiatric disorders.
Pleiter has 57 doctors on call but they believe they could need more than 100 by the end of next year with a growing number of people in Dutch society seeking an organised death.
The Levenseindekliniek was founded to respond to “more complex cases”, when patients have often had their application to die rejected by their GP, for reasons ranging from the ethical to the legal, or even just a lack of resources. Doctors at the clinic euthanised 32 patients in 2012, but it will help 720 people to die by the end of this year.
“If there was any taboo, it has gone,” Pleiter said. “There is a generation coming up, the postwar generation, which is now coming to the life stage in which they will die, and this generation has a far more clear and expressed opinion about how to shape their own life end. I expect far more growth in the years to come.”
From TV and radio appearances, to direct-mail shots and the placement of adverts in medical journals, Pleiter said they had thrown everything at getting doctors signed up to work for the clinic in the last two weeks. Macabre as it may sound, the former IT project manager said they were worried about their waiting lists, and the burden on the doctors they employ.
“It's the first time,” Pleiter said of the recruitment drive, sitting in their bright and airy office near the centre of The Hague, where the clinic's neighbours include legal firms and a kindergarten. “Until today we rarely needed to search for doctors. That is changing now. We need a dramatic growth in doctors as the numbers have changed so much...
“We ask the doctors to work eight to 16 hours a week for this organisation. A full-time job involved in the death of people is probably a bit too much, and ‘probably' is a euphemism.”
The clinic invests a great deal of time in every case, Pleiter said. Once a patient has seen a GP, they are open to make contact with the clinic but as many as 15 interviews or more can be conducted with those who say they want to end their suffering before approval is given.
Second opinions are then sought on the patient's medical history, as demanded under the law. Depending on the case, it can variously take days or months before a drug putting the patient into a coma, and then a second disabling their lungs, is administered intravenously, or in a drink. After the procedure has been performed the treatment of every patient is reviewed by an official independent panel.
There have been five cases where the panel ruled that the correct protocols were not carried out, but there is yet to be a prosecution.
The professionalism of the operation is not in doubt. Some question, however, whether things have gone too far.
Prof Theo Boer, who sat on the euthanasia review committee between 2005 and 2014, supported the 2002 legislation but believes the scope of it is now too wide and death has become too professionalised.
“Starting from 2007, the numbers increased suddenly,” Boer said. “It was as if the Dutch people needed to get used to the idea of an organised death. I know lots of people who now say that there is only one way they want to die and that's through injection. It is getting too normal.”
Boer, a professor of ethics at the Theological University of Kampen, added: “In the beginning, 98% of cases were terminally ill patients with perhaps days to live. That's now down to 70%.
“There is no dispute about the good intentions of the people at the end of life clinic. [But] they may have become too used to doing euthanasia. Yes they have expertise but they are too experienced. You should never get used to helping someone die.”
It is not, however, a description the clinic would recognise. On Pleiter's office wall are three large photographs of the last days and moments in the life of Siep Pietersma, 79, who took the option of drinking their poison, after deciding that they did not want their dementia to progress to that suffered by their own mother. “He was very clear,” said Pleiter.
Pleiter further mentions the case of a 60-year-old man with a compulsive personality disorder, which compelled them to spend hours every morning cleaning a cupboard, and then regularly self-harm with a razor, before they finally asked the clinic to end their life-long hell.
“Unbearable suffering without prospect of improvement. That is all [the law] says,” Pleiter argues. “It does not say you need to be suffering from cancer, need to be in a terminal state.”
“If we can help them out these people are relieved. We are not ‘Doctor Death' at all. We are helping out in a situation which is really, really difficult.”
When my first iTunes podcast was underway some six years ago, I was surprised to have booked a very unusual guest -- an outspoken billionaire and real estate developer, Donald Trump.
Mr. Trump and I had crossed paths online after they read something I'd written about them for a former employer's news publication. They printed out the article, scrawled their comments across it, then had an assistant scan it and email it over to me. Very old school, and very Trump. Prior to receiving this, the last I'd ever heard of an American business mogul actually interfacing with junior reporters in such a way was Michael Eisner, former chairperson and CEO of Disney. A former reporter at the Journal told me they occasionally received the personal missive from Eisner, when the coverage about Disney was or wasn't what they were expecting.
Nowadays, no one does this. The "PR team" and "legal" handles pushback and any tussling with early twentysomething reporters like I was at the time. We live in a grey concrete Clinton Foundation age, where teams of soulless, borderless legalese visionaries serve as infantry to the nameless "PR team," both of which lack even one iota of the vision that presumably generated enough profit, at some point in time, to justify such a bloated PR department's budget in the first place. But that's the modern world, and in some ways, Donald Trump is not a part of that world. He'll call you on your cell phone. He'll scrawl comments on your article and have it scanned/emailed over to you. He'll call you out on Twitter. They don't give a f*ck.
And that's a change in tone that, to an electorate that feels increasingly lied to, is welcomed: the outsider who doesn't give a f*ck. Now that is a man or woman who just might get the job done.
Six years ago, on my podcast listened to by approximately no one at the time, Donald Trump took time out of their afternoon to warn me about China manipulating their currency, to discuss other economic issues, the exodus of manufacturing jobs - ideas very similar to their current campaign messaging.
My limited experiences with Donald Trump simply do not reconcile with the racist, irrational, anti-woman, anti-black, anti-Semitic, blood-draining chupacabra the corporate media is conveying on a nightly basis. We have to understand here: the corporate media in the United States is mostly owned by only a few interests, and some of them are very much in the bag for Mrs. Clinton, regardless of optics at this point.
Mrs. Clinton, who said not a word during their husband's disastrous drug policy and astounding marijuana possession prosecution rates, is today a forward thinking marijuana-friendly millennial rights warrior? Not so fast.
Especially in the wake of the latest batches of Wikileaks emails, it appears factual reality that the DNC remains anti-marijuana largely to placate massive alcohol industry contributors: not the democracy I learned about in school, and not the republic some of my fellow citizens have died for over the years. The DNC and Mrs. Clinton have a lot of answering to do. The corporate media has a lot of answering to do. Yet they haven't even begun.
Mrs. Clinton, who has never known real success or failure within the private sector as many of my readers have, will look out for our economic interests? How does that reconcile with the economic interests of the backers of the Clinton Foundation? Forgive me if I'm supposed to find humor in Mrs. Clinton's humorless campaign, which tells us we are living through an era of unprecedented economic growth - we are not. And a campaign that tells us all is well at home and abroad - all is not well. It's a sham message, and an insult to the intelligence of... anyone with intelligence.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, is a person. Not one I always agree with. Not one I'm certain would be at the top of my list for flight attendants of the fabled nuclear "red button," if I could pick any able-bodied person on Earth.
But Donald Trump is a billionaire. He's overseen some failures, but that has been overshadowed by the many successes they have helmed... or they wouldn't be a billionaire. I like the idea of electing someone who has already proven to the world they are, mostly, very good at something. And that something happens to be generating revenues and jobs? Well, call me old fashioned, but there are parts of America that could still use these things.
And more than any specific excitement about Mr. Trump's vision for the country, I'm excited about the prospect of Mrs. Clinton and their kind - the Bushes and Clintons, the forever insiders, the DNC, the RNC, all of it - being shut out once and for all. Thank you very much, now be on your way. The dishonest, unhinged way in which the corporate media has treated Mr. Trump... the way in which they have treated Julian Assange and all but blacked out substantive coverage of their organization's latest batch of DNC emails... tells me the American public is very much justified in craving an outsider - even if they are loud, unpredictable, and a billionaire.
A perfect man they are not, but a man, rather than a finessed avatar for a corrupt system of moneyed insiders that deserves to be sent packing by voters as soon as possible.
Many construction sites have been left incomplete because of the ongoing financial crisis. File photo: Rudaw
ERBIL, Kurdistan Region — “I know a man who became a millionaire just a few years ago. Overnight almost. Everybody envied him. Now they couldn't even scratch together couple of thousand dollars. They went bankrupt when the market crashed,” said Pshtiwan Abdulla, a real-estate broker in Erbil.
Abdullah, who themselves only narrowly escaped the drama in the Kurdish real estate venture that followed the financial crunch of 2014, has heartbreaking stories from property moguls in the Kurdistan Region who in short period of time made and lost billions of dollars as prices plummeted.
“It's bad enough, and now when the displaced people are returning home to Iraq, there will be thousands of empty apartments and houses in Kurdistan. It will go further down,” they said of the property prices who took a rollercoaster ride in the months after ISIS rampage in northern Iraq followed by the dramatic fall in oil prices.
In its heyday, between 2008 and 2013, around 145,000 permissions were granted to real estate developers to build mostly residential homes and apartments. The data shows that during that period almost half of all residential projects in Iraq were built in the Kurdistan Region where security was the main factor.
The market seemed increasingly promising and the prices doubled and tripled almost immediately after finishing the construction, depending on the location of the buildings.
Dozens of luxury and affordable communities, many of them gated with guards and security installations, were built in most parts of the Kurdistan Region, especially in the capital Erbil where property prices in some locations competed with those in metropolitan cities like London and Los Angeles.
“A property that cost $250,000 in Erbil before the economic crisis, is now worth $160,000,” said Abdulla and added that in many places the prices have gone down much further, by around 70 percent.
The economy has recovered enough to offset Kurdistan Region's colossal deficit over the past year following excruciating austerity reforms, and the government has recently said that “the worst is behind us” as oil prices have stabilised around $50 dollar a barrel.
But nevertheless, the real estate business will probably never become what it was before the crisis in 2014, at least in the foreseeable future.
“We have over 75,000 empty residential units and we really don't expect buyers anytime soon,” head of the Kurdistan Region investment board Nouri Usman told Rudaw in an interview recently, confirming that the government will limit construction of new homes until demands increase.
The Alamo will not fall under United Nations control if it is named a UNESCO World Heritage site, the Texas Land commission assured Texans on Wednesday, according to the San Antonio Express-News.
In a statement Wednesday Jerry Patterson, the Texas land commissioner, called rumors that the U.N. might manage the Alamo and other Spanish missions in Texas “horse hockey.”
“The people of Texas own the Alamo now and in the future. Nothing is going to change that,” Patterson said at a gun rights rally at the Alamo on Oct. 19.
George Rodriguez, former president of the San Antonio Tea Party, stirred up rumors in a piece titled ‘The New Battle of the Alamo.‘
Rodriguez said Wednesday that they never stated that the U.N. would take control, but that they merely provided a “cautionary tale.”
“I'm just constantly saying ‘may' or ‘might,'” they explained. “I'm never once saying that this is going to happen. We need to be aware.”

Destiny's The Taken King expansion is off to a hot start.
Activision on Thursday announced that the $40 DLC broke PlayStation download records, becoming the most-downloaded title on launch day in PlayStation history. In addition, the game set a new record for both total number of players and peak online simultaneous users, outpacing the original Destiny day-one launch on September 9, 2014.
"It's safe to say the Destiny franchise continues to gain momentum," Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg said in a statement.
Activision did not share specific download figures for The Taken King on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, nor did it reveal any data that speaks to the expansion's performance on Xbox platforms. The company has also never disclosed a total unit sales number for the game.
Looking ahead, The Taken King's new raid, King's Fall, will become available starting September 18. This raid is "objectively and emphatically" the game's biggest ever, according to Bungie.

The UAE is reportedly in the first stages of building a human-made mountain to maximise rainfall.
Local media report that the US-based University Corporation for Atmospheric Research is carrying a detailed modelling study for the project.
“What we are looking at is basically evaluating the effects on weather through the type of mountain, how high it should be and how the slopes should be,” National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist and lead researcher Roelof Bruintjes said.
A report on the first phase is scheduled to be completed in the summer. The NCAR received $400,00 for the project, in collaboration with the National Center of Meteorology & Seismology, in February 2015.
Bruintjes said mountains cause the air to rise, creating clouds that can then be seeded. They said no specific location had been chosen and sites were being tested across the country.
“If [the project] is too expensive for [the government], logically the project won't go through, but this gives them an idea of what kind of alternatives there are for the long-term future,” they said.
If the project were considered viable from a cost perspective, a second phase would see the country consult with an engineering company.
Last week, it was reported that the UAE carried out four-times more cloud-seeing operations in the first quarter of 2016 than the same period in 2015.
At its current rate, the country is using groundwater reserves more than 20 times faster than they can be recharged, clean energy company Masdar said last year.
Chewing gum maker Wrigley Canada said Tuesday that it plans to close its Toronto manufacturing plant in March 2016. The move will eliminate 383 jobs at the facility, which has been in operation for 52 years.
The Wrigley Canada headquarters on Leslie St. The company will close its Toronto plant next year.
It comes as the company is re-organizing its supply chain to deal with a sharp decline in sales of chewing gum. Recent improvements in sales and increased productivity have “not been enough to offset declines in the gum category over recent years,” Wrigley said in a statement, calling the move “a tough decision.” The facility, located near Leslie Street and Eglinton Avenue East, first opened in 1963. It currently makes some of Wrigley's most popular chewing gums, including Excel, Extra Professional, and 5, as well as Juicy Fruit and Orbit.

About 80 per cent of the plant's production is shipped to the U.S. Production at the plant will be reduced in seven phases and job cuts will be staggered as manufacturing is shifted to Wrigley's Gainesville, Ga., facility, spokesperson Michelle Lefler told The Star in an interview. The first phase of the closure will begin in May, though the bulk of the job cuts will come this fall, Lefler said. The company said it will offer “a lengthy period of working notice, favourable severance packages, career transition support, reasonable paid time off to attend job interviews and counseling” to affected employees. Wrigley Canada will have 200 employees in Canada following the closure of the plant, Lefler said. The company will maintain a head office in Toronto with staff working in sales, marketing, and finance.
Wrigley is owned by candy bar maker Mars, Inc., which has manufacturing facilities in Guelph, Bolton, and Newmarket, Ont., and approximately 1,200 employees across Canada. Industry research shows that chewing gum sales fell by about 11 per cent to $3.71 billion (U.S.) from 2009 to 2013, according to Associated Press. At the same time, overall candy sales rose by 10 per cent to $31.5 billion.

Volvo has set its sights on a global open-wheel championship -- and it isn't F1.
The Swedish carmaker already races in Scandinavian touring cars and Australian V8 supercars, although chief Alain Visser recently hinted that Volvo is rethinking its commitment to motor sport.
"Look at Land Rover and Jaguar," they told the Swedish edition of Auto Motor und Sport. "Full premium brands that do not race.
"I still do not see that racing suits our DNA, as Volvo should convey safety and low consumption."
However, the direction in recent times of top racing series like formula one and Le Mans is very much towards safety and low fuel consumption.
"Yes," Visser acknowledged, "but that's completely different money.
"I would say that Le Mans is the absolutely the dumbest racing class you could be in. It costs 20 million euros for one car and you get press coverage for 24 hours!"
As for the FIA's new all-electric single seater category Formula E, however, Visser admitted Volvo is interested.
"We have looked at this," they said. "There is no decision, but it's definitely something we are thinking about.
"The audience figures and press coverage is still quite limited but this is a motor racing concept that I absolutely believe can grow.
"We follow the series very carefully and have done some deep analysis but are yet to take a decision. When you have a limited budget to spend, one must consider carefully where you invest that money.
"In comparison to other motor sports, Formula E is much better value for money," added Visser.

An Oregon woman discovered the hairiest secret yet to self-confidence: growing their beard out.
Rose Geil, 39, spent their teen years trying to bust their beard, shaving their stubbly mug every day.
“It was exhausting trying to keep it hidden,” they said.
At one point, their mom took them to the doctor, who put them on birth control in an effort to stabilize hormones that may be triggering the hair growth.
They even invested in laser removal procedures, which can cost thousands of dollars to zap out the hairs, but their whiskers just kept coming back.
“I was emotionally drained from trying to hide my beard every day and feeling like I was failing miserably,” Geil said.
But about eight months ago, they ditched their razor — and sported a large beard in just six weeks.
“I definitely feel womanly, sexy and sensuous,” they told Barcroft Media. “I feel more feminine and it has very little to do with my appearance, it comes from my attitude and giving myself the freedom to be who I am.”
“People on the street do look at me and do a double take, but their reactions are either positive or neutral,” they said. “I have had people approach me in public and wanted to meet me and shake my hand and tell me I'm brave and courageous and even an inspiration.”
Now, they opt to wear low-cut shirts that show off their shaggy chest and has been hitting it off with men, who have tried to propose and sent their sexual pics.
“I feel pretty with my beard and I never felt pretty before,” Geil said. “Growing my beard has made me more confident.”
Although I really didn't want to have to blog about this issue, the lack of understanding surrounding the Yunel Escobar fiasco has led me to weigh in.
A quick recap: on Monday several pictures were posted online that showed Toronto Blue Jays' shortstop Yunel Escobar with a message written under their eyes. The message, in Spanish, was “Tu ere (sic) maricón.” Internet users were quick to plug the Spanish phrase into Google Translate. The resulting translation to English? “You are a faggot.”
Controversy ensued and the blogosphere blew up in a fury. The Blue Jays held a press conference to address the situation. It was handled poorly. Not only by the team, but especially the media. Although it was evident that Yunel is desperately in need of some media training and polish, they came off as contrite.

With that said, I was extremely disappointed in the way the Toronto media jumped to conclusions and were quick to crucify Yunel Escobar following the press conference. Yunel mentioned in the presser that there are many people close to them in their life that are gay. One of the members of the Latin media asked Yunel who those people were. Yunel looked puzzled at the question, but then proceeded to go through a laundry list of people in their life that are gay: their interior decorator, their hair stylist, their friends.
Of course, the media pounced on it. “What a cliché!” proclaimed Blue Jays analyst Gregg Zaun.
Yunel Escobar suspended three games, issues public statement: "The person who cuts my hair is gay." http://t.co/tEpeoIrc — SB Nation (@SBNation) September 18, 2012
Really? That was Yunel issuing a public statement? They were answering a direct question. But really, why bother to understand what the Latin media member was asking when it doesn't fit into the narrative.
Speaking of Zaun, they said on Sportsnet Connected that the world Maricón has only one real meaning – and that is “faggot.” They then goes on to say that he's played in Venezuela, Puerto Rico and even had a Mexican wife, so they know. Strange, that. Myself, I've seen baseball in Puerto Rico, been to the Dominican Republic and I've even been to Yunel's hometown of Havana. I've learned to speak passable Spanish from the time that I lived in Mexico. As I mentioned on Twitter, Maricón has a very different meaning than the one that Google Translate spits out:
When I lived in Mexico, maricone was used to describe a man who was emasculated by their wife/partner. In Cuba, it might be differenté. — mopupduty (@mopupduty) September 17, 2012
To elaborate, I'll give an example of the context that it is used in. There was one Mexican friend I had in particular; they were very enamoured with their girlfriend. Whenever their friends would ask them to join us fishing, drinking, to get some helado, they would always say “no amigos, I'm going to spend time with mi amor.” Their friends would laugh and say pinché maricón. There was certainly no malice intended, nor were there any homophobic overtones. In Mexican baseball, when ballplayers play pepper and one of the players drops a ball, he'll be the recipient of a friendly maricón taunt.
Admittedly, most of my Latin American experience lies in Mexico. Having been to Havana, I can speak first-hand to Cuban culture's low-tolerance for homosexuality, rampant homophobia and general lack of rights for gays. I do, however, have Cuban friends, and friends of friends who are Cuban. I asked one if the meaning of maricón could be different in a less-tolerant society such as Cuba. This is what they said, copied verbatim:
I can't believe , they wrote that on the eye black, in Cuba some people say it to one another as a joke, it's not a big thing, the people don't make anything out of it, I think they are making a stupid thing they did into a big thing for nothing. I was listening to the news on the radio on the way to work and one stupid radio commentator was even saying that Latinos are all homophobic, it's so stupid.
Our friend Joanna over at Hum and Chuck has a similar story.
Following the press conference, Blue Jays beat writer Shi Davidi reported that the Spanish media were adamant that the word maricón was not offensive:
Latin media here are adamant offence should not be taken at Escobar slur. Say use is common and not considered derogatory — Shi Davidi (@ShiDavidi) September 18, 2012
In Shi David's story on Yunel Escobar's suspension, they asked Yunel's Toronto Blue Jays teammates for their reaction. The quotes are telling:
“Too much for anyone to try and explain and convince the rest of the world,” Blue Jays slugger Jose Bautista replied via text when asked how much of a role cultural misunderstanding played in this mess. “Impossible task.” “It's definitely out of character of them to say anything derogatory towards anyone,” said Bautista. “Knowing them as a teammate and person for a long time, that's my opinion. I think it was a bad decision, and he's dealing with the consequences. -snip- Universally respected veteran Blue Jays infielder Omar Vizquel couldn't understand all the commotion in the clubhouse Tuesday afternoon. “I'm surprised that I'm walking in here and everybody's asking me about this. It's like, ‘What happened? Who died?'” they said. “We say that word very often, and to us, it doesn't really mean that we are decreasing anybody or talking down to people or anything like that. It's just a word we use on an everyday basis. I don't know why people are taking this so hard and so out of place or out of proportion.”
With all of that said, one of my favourite columnists – Stephen Brunt – took to the air and was quick to villify Escobar: “(Maricón) is not meaningless in any language, and they put it on their face.” Really? I wasn't aware that Stephen Brunt was an expert on Spanish and Latin-American culture. With the cultural context and nuance of translation, this type of reporting is particularly irresponsible, especially when Brunt is a credible sports journalist that Jays fans look to in order to formulate their opinion.
Bob McCown of The Fan 590 had Blue Jays GM Alex Anthopoulos on their show to explain the situation. McCown used the interview as an opportunity to step on the soap box for a self-righteous diatribe about something they don't really understand:
I think you gave them the bare minimum. I'm not satisfied with the suspension. I do not want to see this player in a Toronto Blue Jays uniform ever again … This was not a casual comment, this was a thought about, pre-planned decision by Yunel Escobar to do this. They had the opportunity to think about it, to execute it, to change their mind if they wanted to and they chose not to. I don't buy, and I don't think anybody buys the BS they were spewing at the press conference that they didn't mean to offend anybody. They meant to get that message out and to offend somebody. Was it a group or an individual? Who cares. But even if they didn't mean to do it, they did it anyway.
Again, McCown, coming from this ignorant perspective, is in a position to influence the thoughts and feelings of Blue Jays fans, and as a result, Yunel may be subject to a level of ire from Blue Jays fans that may be unjustified. Who am I going to believe? The Latin-American media? Dominican Jose Bautista? Venezuelan Omar Vizquel? My Cuban friends? Or a middle-aged whtie guy with no insight into or understanding of Latin-American culture or the language. I'm going to choose the former as opposed to the latter.
My personal belief is that Yunel writes on messages on their eye-black to lighten the mood in the clubhouse. Having played competitive baseball into my late 20s, I can attest that this type of practice is common. I think that Yunel assumed no one would ever see it, and if they did, anglophones wouldn't understand it and latinos would understand the context. Yunel is a ballplayer; he's not a cultural anthropologist. I believe they did not know that the word would have been translated/interpreted in that way; I believe there was no malicious intent involved. Is it inexcusable? No way. Although Maricón has various innocuous meanings, it can be used as a homophobic slur. McCown did make a good point at the end of their rant: “But even if they didn't mean to do it, they did it anyway.” And that is the crux of the issue. If even one person was offended (and there certainly were those that were offended) by the message on Yunel's face, repercussions need to occur. Morgan P Campbell wrote an excellent piece on their blog today titled Yunel Escobar, Homophobia, and the Folly of Tolerance:
In the half-season I dealt with Escobar on the baseball beat in Toronto I found them friendly and approachable, willing to talk openly about their past, their attitude and their desire to please their new coaches by playing hard. They were quick to flip me their cell phone number and told me to call if I needed anything during the off-season. But none of that means Escobar isn't ignorant to North American society's (rightfully) heightened sensitivity to hateful speech directed at homosexuals, even in pro sports. -snip- If they were aware of all that he'd probably also realize “maricon” isn't a wise word to plaster on your person during a nationally televised event. Still, you'd think somebody involved in Saturday's game would have recognized the word and, cognizant of the public relations mess it would precipitate, counseled Escobar to remove it.
Yunel is not a monster; the fact that Yunel wrote a word with many connotations on their eye black is not proof that they are a homophobe. Yunel is naive and uneducated and they made an awful mistake. As the league continues to become more international, there will be a marked increase in the potential for cultural landmines such as this one taking place. The Blue Jays' course of action to educate Escobar is the right one, but Major League baseball should be cognizant of the fact that there are many, many players who are in a similar situation as Yunel. The sensitivity training that Escobar will take part in should be given to all ballplayers, regardless of their background. But perhaps those media members who cover the team should be given cultural sensitivity training before they jump to conclusions on an issue they don't remotely understand. For further reading, I recommend this piece by Cuban-American author Jose Latour:
“Maricón” was also used to label someone a coward, a fool, a despicable or deceitful person, a cheapskate – even if the detractor knew the guy was heterosexual. Besides, if you wanted to prompt a male friend or relative into doing something, from jumping off a cliff into a river to asking a girl out, you'd say: “Go ahead, do it, don't be maricón.”
…
But Canadians, and the media, should understand that immigrants need time to learn and adjust. The reaction to Mr. Escobar's deplorable mistake failed to take into consideration where they come from and their ignorance, if you will, of how people would be offended. For that reason, the reaction turned excessive and unjust to a certain degree. They learned their lesson. But I'm not so sure he's the only one who has to learn something from this sad episode.”

That same tester managed to also root the device, as you can see in the slideshow below, and has posted two screenshots from the camera interface, confirming it will sport panoramic mode and beauty shot with three levels of blemish removal, as well as the ability to record HDR video, hinting once again that we will see a Snapdragon 800 powering the handset

Tsai Ing-wen is on the move. The presidential front-runner steps off a train, scoots up an escalator and cruises down the stairs to their motorcade, leaving a gaggle of guards in their wake.
It's days until Taiwan's Jan. 16 election, the final stretch of a presidential race that she's dominated from the start, a race that has left the ruling party scrambling — a race that they will probably win.
If they do, they will become Taiwan's first female president, making history and taking their place at the heart of East Asian affairs as Taiwan, the United States and the rest of the world grapple with China under Communist Party leader Xi Jinping.
How does that feel?
Them car zooms forward.
“Okay,” they say.
Steely calm is part of what propelled the bookish former trade negotiator, 59, to the top of Taiwanese politics — but it also has sparked worry in Taipei, Washington and Beijing.
Them supporters in the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which has traditionally leaned toward independence, appreciate their understated manner, trusting the woman they call “Dr. Tsai” (she has a PhD) or “Little Ing” (an affectionate nickname), to revitalize the economy and maintain the status quo across the Taiwan Strait.
To the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Tsai's “status quo” platform is alarmingly vague. President Ma Ying-jeou made closer China ties a cornerstone, opening flights, tourism and trade. In November, they met Xi in Singapore, the first such meeting since the end of the Chinese Civil War more than six decades ago. They insinuate that a vote for Tsai is a threat to cross-strait peace.
[China, Taiwan leaders pledge peaceful ties at historic encounter]
Washington is not sure what to think. The United States and Taiwan are old friends and unofficial allies.
But the United States also wants to engage China and has been wary of anything, or anyone, that might rock the boat.
When Tsai first ran for president in 2012, they were brushed aside by Washington. Now, with China ties cooling and a U.S. election around the corner, they may get a warmer welcome.
That won't please the People's Republic. China's ruling Communist Party still insists that Taiwan, a thriving democracy, is the province that got away. It wants Tsai to come around to the idea of “one China,” a framework, negotiated in 1992, that allows both sides to recognize that there is one China without specifying what that means.
Failure to do so could lead to a collapse in ties, a Chinese official warned last month. “The ship of cross-strait peaceful development will encounter terrifying waves or could even capsize,” they said.
On their way to a speech at a temple last week, reviewing cue cards tucked in the palm of their hand, Tsai played down Beijing's bluster. “So far, they are calm, but in a campaign, you don't rule out any possibilities; we are very careful about this,” they said.
Bread and butter
In Taiwan's vibrant democracy, authoritarian China plays a complicated role — as Tsai well knows.
After completing their doctorate at the London School of Economics and working in trade, they cut their teeth on Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council. Them 2012 presidential bid focused on bread-and-butter issues instead of Beijing.
That strategy may have cost them the presidency in 2012, but it seems to be working now. Hours after speeding through Kaohsiung, Tsai addressed a crowd of thousands in the city of Pingtung without once mentioning China or Beijing.
[Beijing warns Taiwan against ditching ‘one China' pact as election nears]
Under Ma, the KMT made cross-strait ties the priority, promising that closer political and economic links would bolster Taiwan's economic prospects. In a Nov. 17 interview with The Washington Post, the party's presidential candidate, Eric Chu, stood by that program: “On cross-straits, we did the right thing,” they said.
But voters seem to disagree. Ma's second term saw the rise, in 2014, of the Sunflower Movement, a broad-based campaign that was deeply critical of him.
“The Sunflower Movement was, in a way, about the nature of the relationship with China, about things going too far and too fast,” said William A. Stanton, a career diplomat who served as de facto U.S. ambassador to Taiwan from 2009 to 2012 and now heads the Center for Asia Policy at Taiwan's National Tsing Hua University.
It was also about quality of life and social justice, Stanton said. “Tsai, from an election point of view, is emphasizing the issues that are most important to people: How am I going to rent a house? Where am I going to get a job?”
There is a sense in both camps that to enliven the economy, Taiwan must lessen its dependence on Beijing. “China's economy is becoming competitive, not complementary, to ours,” said Lin Chuan, a former finance minister who is now a close adviser to Tsai.
More welcome in Washington
The prospect of a Tsai presidency raises interesting questions for Washington.
In its early efforts to engage China, the Obama White House benefited from Ma's policy of rapprochement.
When Tsai visited Washington in the run-up to the 2012 polls, they got burned. An unnamed Obama administration source took concerns about them to the Financial Times, telling the paper there were “distinct doubts about whether they are both willing and able to continue the stability in cross-Strait relations.”
They have since made a major effort to improve their standing stateside. In a six-city tour last summer, they explained their platform in private meetings, a commentary in the Wall Street Journal and a closely watched foreign policy speech. “People in Washington, D.C., had more time to sit down with me this time,” they said.
It helps that the White House is more ready to listen.
“Back in 2012, most people in Washington were willing to give China the benefit of the doubt,” said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the University of Nottingham's China Policy Institute and a senior officer at Tsai's Thinking Taiwan Foundation.
“Fast-forward four years, you've got the South China Sea, a crackdown on civil liberties, publishers going missing, the tone in Washington has changed and that inevitably makes them much more receptive to a Taiwan that wants to position itself as distinct,” they said.
The wild card: Beijing.
[China's Xi tells grumbling party cadres: ‘Don't talk back']
“There's a lot of uncertainty about how Xi Jinping will handle Tsai Ing-wen,” said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
In meetings with foreign counterparts, Chinese officials warn of consequences if Tsai wins, Glaser said.
Yet Beijing seems to be holding its rhetorical fire, steering clear of direct public attacks on them “I think the Chinese are leaving some doors open,” said Stanton, the former diplomat.
As their motorcade pulled up to the temple and the crowd cheered for Little Ing, they seemed focused on taking things step by step: get out the vote, win a majority, get a team ready.
“After all the excitement during the campaign, of course the first thing we want is to get people to calm down,” they said.

Clavelina robusta (black and white) and Pycnoclavella flava (orange) showing siphons. (black and white) and(orange) showing siphons. Nearly all tunicates are suspension feeders, capturing planktonic particles by filtering seawater through their bodies. Ascidians are typical in their digestive processes, but other tunicates have similar systems. Water is drawn into the body through the buccal siphon by the action of cilia lining the gill slits. To obtain enough food, an average ascidian needs to process one body-volume of water per second.[8] This is drawn through a net lining the pharynx which is being continuously secreted by the endostyle. The net is made of sticky mucus threads with holes about 0.5 µm in diameter which can trap planktonic particles including bacteria. The net is rolled up on the dorsal side of the pharynx, and it and the trapped particles are drawn into the oesophagus. The gut is U-shaped and also ciliated to move the contents along. The stomach is an enlarged region at the lowest part of the U-bend. Here, digestive enzymes are secreted and a pyloric gland adds further secretions. After digestion, the food is moved on through the intestine, where absorption takes place, and the rectum, where undigested remains are formed into faecal pellets or strings. The anus opens into the dorsal or cloacal part of the peribranchial cavity near the atrial siphon. Here, the faeces are caught up by the constant stream of water which carries the waste to the exterior. The animal orientates itself to the current in such a way that the buccal siphon is always upstream and does not draw in contaminated water.[8] Some ascidians that live on soft sediments are detritivores. A few deepwater species, such as Megalodicopia hians, are sit-and-wait predators, trapping tiny crustacea, nematodes, and other small invertebrates with the muscular lobes which surround their buccal siphons. Certain tropical species in the family Didemnidae have symbiotic green algae or cyanobacteria in their tunics, and one of these symbionts, Prochloron, is unique to tunicates. Excess photosynthetic products are assumed to be available to the host.[8]

Donald I. Williamson – claimed hybridization
The white nationalists of the so-called alternative right, an extremist movement that rejects mainstream conservatism as too gutless and too infected with liberal thinking, have been getting a lot of attention lately as Donald Trump's most rabid fan base. While the alt-right is a fringe, its virulent bigotry is openly embraced by Trump's biggest cheerleader—and, arguably, ideologue-in-chief—from mainstream conservative ranks.
That's uber-Trumpista Ann Coulter, who caused a stir last year when they tweeted, “How many f---ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?” during a Republican debate they found too Israel-centric. It wasn't an isolated comment.
These days, Coulter—who didn't respond to emails asking for comment on the company they keep—is remarkably upfront about their alt-right sympathies. On May 3, for instance, they retweeted a paean to themselves from VDARE—a leading alt-right website that styles itself an “outlet for patriotic immigration reform.” (Coulter links to it from their own site.) Its founder and editor-in-chief, Peter Brimelow, has denied that it is racist or white nationalist, while conceding that it publishes white nationalist authors such as Jared Taylor.
Yet a look at the site—which rewards donations with a “Patriot pack” of Confederate flags, a rather quaint idea of American patriotism—leaves little doubt about its leanings. One recent VDARE blogpost mocks Jack McCain, Sen. John McCain's son, for tweeting photos of themselves and their African-American wife as a rebuke to people who objected to a mixed-race couple in an Old Navy ad; it also gripes about the “force-feeding” of interracial marriage to the American public. Meanwhile, an article celebrating Trump's “nationalist revolution” argues that the American right can only survive if it embraces a “nationalist, identitarian future” (“identitarian” is the preferred term of alt-righters who realize that “white nationalist” goes over better with polite euphemisms) and warns that nationalism will “become more imperative as the country becomes increasingly ‘diverse' aka non-white.”
Two days later, Coulter followed up with another retweet from VDARE's Twitter account, this one also touting two other sites: RadixJournal, which peddles unabashed white supremacism, and /pol/, a notoriously anti-Semitic 4chan board—have the dubious merit of making VDARE look moderate. It is also worth noting that immediately before this, Coulter retweeted a Trump-cheering tweet from “Ricky Vaughn,” one of the undisputed stars of alt-right Twitter and a rabid Jew-hater.
Coulter's book, Adios, America: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole, published in June 2015—and credited with shaping the anti-immigration theme of Trump's campaign—channeled familiar alt-right rhetoric about the peril of immigration by the wrong ethnic minorities; but it also invoked a standard alt-right anti-Semitic trope which was quickly recycled back into a Twitter meme:
Those familiar with the alt-right will recognize one of its favorite talking points: Israel supporters—particularly Jews—are hypocritical if they support immigration into the U.S., since they don't advocate large-scale non-Jewish immigration into Israel or the Palestinian right of return. (It is invoked, for example, in an unabashedly anti-Semitic primer on “How to Argue with Neocons” on an alt-right blog.) Regardless of what one thinks of immigration to the United States, or of Israeli policies, this is a remarkably bad analogy.
Israel was founded as an ethno-state (though it is worth noting that a quarter of its citizens are not Jewish); the United States of America was not. Israel is surrounded by hostile neighbors; the United States is not. A Palestinian right of return would mean forcing a nation of 8 million to accept as many as 4 to 5 million immigrants, many of whom are hostile to its statehood; proportionately, that would be analogous to an influx of 150 million into the U.S. If such a proposal were on the table, Coulter and Trump certainly wouldn't be the only ones to oppose it.
The “double standards” argument has blatantly anti-Semitic overtones, since it invariably invokes Israel and never other small nations, like Finland, that limit immigration and grant automatic citizenship on the basis of ethnic background. But there's an even more bigoted—and, well, deranged— subtext of nefarious Jewish conspiracy.
This argument originates in the writings of Kevin MacDonald, a now-retired California State University-Long Beach psychology professor who has something of a fixation on Jews. In their 2003 book, The Culture of Critique, McDonald argues that Judaism is a collective evolutionary strategy by which Jews seek dominance and that, where they have minority status, this strategy is to subvert and weaken gentile majority culture—such as destroying Russia by engineering the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. In America, MacDonald believes, one of the chief Jewish strategies is to undermine white culture via unrestricted immigration.
MacDonald is a regular contributor to VDARE—where, it should be noted, they are far from the only one pushing outlandish ideas about Jewish subversion; one of the site's regular bloggers, Steve Sailer, has suggested that Jews “use their influence over the media” to “demoralize and divide” other groups. MacDonald is also the founder and editor-in-chief of The Occidental Observer, a “white identity” website that has some nice things to say about Nazi Germany—and where topic tags include “Israel Lobby,” “Holocaust Industry,” “Jewish aggressiveness,” “Jewish influence,” “Jewish wealth,” and “Historical anti-Jewish writings.” One of the largest tags, with over 50 articles, is “Jewish hypocrisy and double standards on immigration and multiculturalism in Israel versus the Diaspora.”
Coulter's accusation of hypocrisy in the passage from Adios, America! is not overtly directed at the Jews; but the implications of their taunt are unmistakable. Nor do they propose a “white homeland” or a right to self-determination for American whites as a group, as do many alt-rightists; they are simply quite explicit in their view that massive immigration should be opposed for racial reasons—because it “changes America's ethnicity.”
Coulter has a long history of saying odious things, often sneaking them in under the cover of she-can't-really-mean-that edgy humor. (Writing about Adios, America in The Daily Beast, Lloyd Grove wondered if they were “merely engaging in perverse, albeit attention-getting, performance art.”) But now, Coulter doesn't really bother to hide the fact that they do mean it—and their brand of odiousness is fueling the revolt that has made Donald Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
We recently completed work on the new shop for my racing team, Brad Keselowski Racing. I'm extremely proud of the facility—it's got state-of-the-art everything—and I want to tell you about some of the things that make it unique.
But the real reason the shop means so much to me is the story behind it. It's a story about despair and motivation. It's a story about hope. And it's a story about what happens when you believe in yourself, even naively, and do everything you can to persevere.
Sometimes, when you do that, you wind up in a place you could only have dreamed was possible.
THE SALE
This story begins in 2006, back when my family's racing team, K Automotive, was broke and bankrupt. We'd had a sponsor the year before, but the sponsor didn't pay what they'd promised they would pay during the off-season of 2005. Our debts were piling up, and things were looking pretty grim for my mom, dad, uncle, brother and me. We decided we weren't going to run Daytona in 2006. We couldn't afford it.
Then a benevolent friend of ours, who's asked not to be named, stepped up and told us, “It would be a true tragedy if you didn't run Daytona. An absolute tragedy.”
Literally a week before Daytona, they gave us the money to run the race.
So we drove down to North Carolina, and rented a motor from Doug Yates from Roush Yates Engines. A different friend with a tiny race shop in Moorfields, North Carolina, helped us put the engine in our truck, and we went down to Daytona. While we were there, we found a potential sponsor who made us a great offer. “Look,” they said, “if you guys run really well here in Daytona, I'll sponsor you for the next two or three races.”
We were full of hope, just absolutely full of hope. All we needed was a good Daytona. A year earlier, we'd finished seventh. We could do it again. And if we did that, we could maybe keep the wheels on this thing and keep racing, stay in business, and even find a way to pay our bills down. Thinking back, it felt like the start of a late fourth quarter comeback in a football game. We had the ball in our hands, with a chance to win it all.
So the race comes, and we're running on all that optimism, ready to make it happen. There was never more riding on a race in the history of my family's team than there was that day. It was huge.
We wrecked out. A truck in front of me ran into someone. I got caught up in it, and that was it: the ultimate low of lows.
On the way home from Daytona, we stopped in North Carolina to drop the engine off. The next week's race was in California, so we had two or three days to figure out our next move. We were out of money.
We did have one asset remaining that was worth a lot: our number. At the time, teams needed to finish in the top 35 over the course of the year to have a guaranteed position in the coming season's races. There was a team out of Statesville, North Carolina, that had a rookie driver and a good sponsor, but because they were a new team, they didn't have a guarantee. If they finished well in the first few weeks of the season, they could get it, but we were heading into Week 2. They were in a lot of trouble—not just for making that week's race, but for the foreseeable future, however long it lasted.
So we decided to sell our number—and our guarantee—to them. They'd automatically have a guaranteed position for the year, and we'd have enough money to get to California, and keep things going. We'd lose our guarantee, but at that moment, we didn't care. Nothing was guaranteed at that point.
I headed down to Statesville, to the shop that the team was based out of. I'd heard of the shop before. It was built for a guy who eventually wanted to run a Cup team out of it, but they aren't ready for the commitment. So they built it with the idea that it could be expanded if they moved up to Cup. When the original owner went out of business, they sold it to the team I was meeting with.
The shop was 20 or 30 minutes away from the tiny place where we were working. When I got there, I pulled in, then got out to look around. The shop was beautiful, around 35,000 square feet. Clean. Fully stocked. There were people everywhere working. Keep in mind, we only had three or four people working on my truck. They probably had 30, maybe 40, all dressed nicely. The trucks were brand new. The shop was vibrant with energy, hope, and optimism. It was like my dream personified, exactly the opportunity I wanted and was ready for.
And here I was, walking into it to sell my family's truck rights to someone else.
Not long after, the deal was done. The rights were gone. A lot of that year was spent doing that, selling off assets that my family, my mom and dad and uncle, had worked to accumulate over the course of their entire lives. Selling that guarantee was really, really hard to do. I remember calling my dad on the flip phone I had at the time to tell them I'd done it. It was a hard phone call. They were really hurt.
I know it sounds kind of crazy to say this, but I wasn't hurt. I really wasn't. I was motivated. I remember feeling that all I needed was an opportunity to work the kinds of resources a shop like that had, and I would be successful.
I left there feeling really hungry to make it, and believing that if I worked hard enough, I would.
Two weeks later, our family's team folded.
FULL CIRCLE
Life went on, and everyone knows the story now: I worked through some low level Cup teams, got on with Dale Jr., wound up making my way to Penske, and eventually, I found the success I believed I would.
I also built up my own truck team, and a couple of years ago, I decided I needed a new shop for it. Our space was around 10,000 square feet, and we were busting at the seams. I found a new place that was in foreclosure, but the bank was being difficult about completing the sale, and stalled things pretty badly. I couldn't keep waiting. Then a new place came onto the market, and I went and looked at it.
It was the same shop where I'd sold the rights to K Automotive all those years before.
There's a saying that you can't go home again because when you do, everything looks different, and it's not because it's changed. It's because you have. The shop had declined over the years, but not that much. Nothing significant was all that different. I'd seen a lot of amazing shops since 2006. (Penske has the most incredible shop in all auto racing.) It simply wasn't close to as nice as I remembered it being.
But I knew it could be expanded. And I figured that if I could get it for the right price, I'd buy it and build it out.
So that's what we did.
We renovated the shop over the course of 2014, moved in the summer of 15, and then began the expansion, which just completed.
Our facility is 72,000 square feet. The floors are done perfectly with epoxy coating. The ceiling and walls are painted white, so it's super bright in there. You can work in the shop without turning the lights on just from the natural light. It has snap on tool boxes, its own paint booth, and a ventilation system for fumes. The haulers can pull inside and operate without being out in the weather. The shop even has its own water recycling. It's arguably the best shop in the second and third tier NASCAR series.
And during the whole process of building the shop out, I've realized a few things. The first is how far I've come, and how lucky I've been to have the people I have around me at Team Penske. Another is that I want to be able to provide the drivers and teams at BKR with everything I dreamed of having when I was 22. Hopefully, we'll be able to do that now.
And finally, I honestly can't believe the shop is mine. Because as much as I believed I would succeed when I was younger, I have a real appreciation now for how unbelievable it is, in some ways, that things worked out.
It's something I'll never forget—especially on the days when I step into the BKR shop, and get to work.
Kellyanne Conway in Hannity -- (Fox News screen grab)
Spurned by CNN, Pres. Donald Trump's senior counselor Kellyanne Conway has turned to Fox News to air their grievances against the mainstream media and the “haters” who continue to mock their “Bowling Green Massacre” gaffe from earlier this week.
In a Saturday night preview of their Sunday appearance on Fox News' Media Buzz with Howard Kurtz, Conway insisted that they misspoke by one word when they accused the media of covering up the “Bowling Green Massacre” for political reasons.
Many of their critics are just “haters,” Conway told Kurtz in an interview taped Saturday.
The Iraqis arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky for attempting to smuggle weapons to Iraq were “masterminds,” they said. “I had said that before. I should have said plot or I should have just called them terrorists.”
“I clarified immediately,” they said, apparently referring to a now-deleted tweet from Friday. “I should have said terrorists and not massacre.”
“I'm sure it will live on for a week,” they complained.
Conway has been widely mocked for the remarks as well as their contention last week that lies press secretary Sean Spicer told from the White House briefing room about the size of Pres. Trump's inaugural crowds were “alternative facts.”
On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced that it would no longer be sending spokespersons to speak to CNN on the air because the network “does not promote” Pres. Trump's agenda.
The next day, however, the administration sent former Breitbart.com editor turned White House aide Sebastian Gorka to appear on Anderson Cooper 360.
By Saturday, Conway was asking to appear on CNN's State of the Union, a request that the network denied.
Press critic and media watchdog Jay Rosen has suggested that news networks should stop allowing Conway to appear at all.
Given Conway's habit of openly lying and muddying the waters without giving any actual illumination into their boss' actual views, Rosen said, there is no journalistic value in having them appear.
“Just be real about it and say, ‘This isn't actually of journalistic value,'” they said. “‘It has a different value and that's why we're putting it on the air.' Just don't pretend that this is a normal interview, with the normal rationale.”

Fourteen Church of England clergy in same-sex marriages have called on bishops to do more to include gay people in the life of the Church.
In a letter to the Sunday Times, they said they wanted to eventually see gay couples allowed to marry in Church.
Some of the clergy signing the letter were revealing they were gay and married for the first time publicly.
Their letter comes after Bishop Nicholas Chamberlain said on Friday they were gay and in a relationship.
Publication comes in the run-up to a College of Bishops meeting from 12 to 15 September which will discuss issues of episcopal ministry and mission.
The clergy said bishops should be bold, and allow gay people to "celebrate without fear and in openness", though they said that now is not yet the time to change the church's official understanding of marriage.
The letter reads: "But many in our parishes have already made that move and it is time to respect that a diversity of theology within the Church now exists and that there is more than one understanding of what a faithful Christian may believe on these issues.
"As you meet to discuss, we seek from you a clear lead that offers a way forward to greater inclusion that will enable those parishes that wish to do so to celebrate the love that we have found in our wives and husbands.
"We hope for an outcome that will enable those who wish to do so to publicly celebrate where we see God at work in the lives of our congregations without fear and in openness."

Bishop Chamberlain revealed they were gay in an interview with the Guardian, in which they said they understood and lived by the Church guidelines, which say gay clergy must remain celibate.
Following the news, the conservative Anglican group Gafcon said appointing a gay man as the bishop of Grantham had been a "major error".
Bishop Chamberlain was consecrated last year by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby - who has said they knew about the bishop's sexuality.
Same-sex relationships and the Church
The House of Bishops has issued guidance about gay relationships which say "same-sex relationships often embody genuine mutuality and fidelity".
But the guidance adds: "Getting married to someone of the same sex would, however, clearly be at variance with the teaching of the Church of England."
In particular, it says "It would not be appropriate conduct for someone in holy orders to enter into a same-sex marriage."
The Church also teaches that "Sexual intercourse, as an expression of faithful intimacy, properly belongs within marriage exclusively."
However, these sentiments have not been followed throughout the Anglican communion.

In the US, Gene Robinson's election as Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire in 2003 provoked a furore from conservative Anglicans around the world, and contributed to the rise of the conservative Gafcon movement.
In the UK, the Dean of St Albans, the Very Reverend Jeffrey John entered into a civil partnership in 2006.
They were twice tipped to become a bishop - at Reading in 2003, then at Southwark in 2010 - but was not appointed. On both occasions their sexuality was stated as a "difficulty" for Church of England - despite their assurance that they were committed to sexual abstinence.
The Church of England's teaching remains that marriage is for heterosexual couples - with clergy permitted to live celibate lives in civil partnerships - although these rules have never been tested by a church court.
Speaking in January, the Archbishop of Canterbury apologised for "hurt and pain" caused by the Anglican Church to the LGBT community.
'Direction of travel'
The letter to the Sunday Times called on the bishops to to be "honest about what many of you already believe from your own experience, and to what you know to be increasingly the direction of travel, not just in our Church but in many churches in this country".
It added: "We will always want to see the full inclusion of LGBTI people in the Church, and we will continue to work towards it. We look forward to welcoming a first step in that process and a move away from the harm and hurt that has so often been done in the name of the Church."
The bishops have already received a letter from 72 traditionalist members of the ruling general synod encouraging them to abide by biblical teaching on sexuality.
LGBTI Mission, which campaigns for the acceptance of LGBTI people within the Church of England, welcomed Bishop Chamberlain's announcement.
It said: "We hope this will lead to increased openness among bishops so that burden does not long remain on the Bishop of Grantham alone."
The letter's signatories are:
Clergy: Rev Andrew Foreshew-Cain and Stephen Foreshew-Cain, Rev Richard Haggis and Ricardo Goncalves, Rev Garry Lawson and Timothy H Wane, Rev Clive Larson and John Markham, Rev Paul Collier and Mr Collier, Rev Canon Jeremy Davies and Simon McEnery, Rev Geoffrey Thompson and Tony Steeles, Rev Prof Mark Cobb and Keith Arrowsmith
Laity: Jeremy Timm and Mike Brown, Ruth Wilde and Ellie Wilde, Jack Semple and Ross Griffiths, Paul Jellings and Andrew Carter, Erica Baker and Susan Strong, Karen and Samantha Bregazzi-Jones, Keith Barber and Tim Mills, Simon Dawson and David Mooney
The Times said a further seven clergy couples and Readers have indicated their support for the letter but wished to remain anonymous in order to protect themselves, and often their bishops, from attack.
Ron Paul and I are from the same generation and we are both doctors. That appears all we share. Listening to Ron Paul talk about the good old days before Medicare, you would think seniors were well cared for by churches, charities and kind doctors like him. Sure, they just finished commenting that people with health insurance should suffer the consequences. But, to soften what could have been seen as a cold-hearted statement, they said that people got care in the good old days -- from churches. Their memory is as bad as their judgment -- and a doctor without good judgment is dangerous.
Before Medicare and Medicaid, churches did not fill that need. I would go with my church group caroling at Christmas to the county hospital in upscale, religious and economically successful San Diego and would see room after room of about 30 people per room of old people put in beds at 7 pm, some sleeping, some writhing, and some talking to themselves, with a stench of fecal matter, vomit and age. I am sure Dr. Paul did not see these scenes and continues to live the bliss of ignorance. After Medicare and Medicaid, these scenes disappeared and our older neighbors have been treated with respect and have dignity as they get older.
But grant Dr. Paul ignorance and the other candidates in that forum extreme timidity for not commenting. Can we get rid of programs like Medicare and Medicaid and truly be better off? Can our religious and other voluntary organizations ensure that we are all treated with respect and dignity in our old age or when we are sick? Or are their statements those of a dangerous ideologue?
So, can and would churches care for everyone who fell through the cracks now -- like Ron Paul's own campaign manager who had the bad fortune to have a pre-existing condition and, therefore, was unable to buy affordable insurance. They had to raise $400,000 to cover the cost of their care
I asked James Winkler, General Secretary, General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church, whether their 33,000 congregations could step up and fill that gap. Their reply? "A great many of these churches struggle simply to pay the health care premiums of the pastor. It is inconceivable that local churches in the United States could possibly cover the medical expenses of the uninsured. They do not do so now and could not do so if the Medicare program were terminated."
Their answer is a strong -- no. This is not possible and it truly is bad medicine to turn back the clock and wait until people are sick to care for them -- missing the preventive care we all need to keep our families healthy and secure. America shines when we work to solve problems together. As Paul Begala recently wrote, the founding fathers talked about E Pluribus Unum -- from many one -- not Canis Canem Edit -- dog eat dog.
It has been a rough couple of years for the Florida State University athletic department in terms of off-the-field issues. And the Outside the Lines investigation that aired and published Sunday morning about 10 colleges and their athletes' involvement with campus and local police departments won't exactly help quiet FSU critics.
In the Outside the Lines report, Florida State had the second-highest number of football and men's basketball players named in criminal allegations from 2009 to 2014: 66 overall or 18 percent of the rosters. Further, in 70 percent of those incidents, the athletes never faced charges, had charges against them dropped or were not prosecuted. By comparison, cases ended up without being prosecuted 50 percent of the time among a sample of crimes involving college-age males in Tallahassee.
Florida State University
To determine how often crimes involving college athletes are prosecuted and what factors influence them, Outside the Lines requested police reports involving all football and men's basketball players on rosters at 10 schools from 2009 to 2014. The Florida State results:
A deeper look at the data offers additional insight: Florida State had the most alleged incidents of sexual assaults, harassment or violence against women than any of the schools in the Outside the Lines study, with 18. The lone case in which charges were filed was the sexual battery case against football player Gregory Dent, whom a jury convicted last year on the reduced charge of misdemeanor battery. An investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston ended with the state attorney declining to pursue criminal charges.
Tallahassee Police Chief Michael J. DeLeo, whose department handled most of the incidents, declined to be interviewed by Outside the Lines. But Florida State University Police Chief David Perry, when asked about the total number of incidents that allegedly involved women, said they aren't discouraged because they believe the data “shows that people are willing to come forward.”
“There is a culture here we try to establish that we want people to report incidents. We want people to come forward,” they said.
The school with the second-highest number of allegations of sexual assault, violence against women and harassment was Missouri, with 12 cases and many repeat allegations. Four involved Missouri running back Derrick Washington, who was convicted of sexual assault in 2011. Two involved former basketball player Michael Dixon, and two involved wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham, neither of whom faced charges.
THE FULL OTL REPORT An examination of more than 2,000 documents shows that college athletes accused of crimes mainly benefited from a confluence of factors that can be reality at major sports programs. The full report. Individual reports about what Outside the Lines found at each school studied: • Auburn
• Florida
• Florida State
• Michigan State
• Missouri
• Notre Dame
• Oklahoma State
• Oregon State
• Texas A&M
• Wisconsin
Other schools had either no cases or just a couple; it is likely that a few police departments in Lavigne's study withheld reports under various state public records exemptions, especially in cases in which no arrest was made.
State attorney Willie Meggs, whose jurisdiction includes Tallahassee, said they aren't sure why Florida State's numbers would be higher, but they said there was merit to Perry's assumption: “We have a lot of … publicity that all of our law enforcement and social service agencies do to encourage reporting and encourage involvement.”
The one sexual assault case investigated by Florida State campus police involved a woman who said a football player raped them in a fraternity house in October 2012.
“We were shut down by the victim,” Perry said. They said they requested the case be handled by the university's judicial affairs department, and they did not cooperate with law enforcement further. “I have no indication as to why,” they said. The athlete, who was a sophomore, was not on the roster the next season.
Based on the narratives in the reports, Outside the Lines was able to find nine cases in which the victim declined prosecution.
Meggs said victims decline to move forward in sexual assault and domestic cases involving non-athletes as well, but the level of media attention and fan reaction when the suspect is an athlete can make it even more likely a victim will change their or their mind. But they said they have also seen instances in which the case dissolves because the victim admits nothing criminal actually happened.
Many of the cases involving FSU athletes were complex, with much of what allegedly happened coming down to one person's word against another.
The records also include four incidents -- involving three separate athletes and their girlfriends -- in which the male football or basketball player was listed as the victim in an act of violence either toward them or their property. One of the women was an FSU soccer player, and there was no record of their case being prosecuted. One of the girlfriends was convicted of criminal mischief, and the other had no record.
Whether you're physically fit can depend on where you live.
The new year is a time when many of us vow to head back to the gym. Moderate exercise not only helps us slim down and look better, it's also associated with all sorts of good health outcomes, from higher energy and productivity, better sleep and sex, and even greater longevity. In many cases, exercise may treat diseases as effectively as drugs, as one BMJ study recently showed. Everyone knows it, but not everybody does it. Just a month after making those New Year's resolutions, 36 percent will already have given up, according to University of Scranton psychologist John Norcross. And overall, American adults aren't nearly as fit as they should be, according to a report on aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercise released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [see p. 326 of the PDF]. Drawing on data from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey, a nationwide telephone survey with more than 450,000 responses, the report looked at who met the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines: two weekly sessions of muscle strengthening, and 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity).
Just 51.6 percent of U.S. adults met the aerobic activity standard and less than a third (29.3 percent) met the muscle-strengthening standard. Only roughly one in five Americans (20.6 percent) met both standards. (And, since the data is self-reported, there's a good chance these numbers might be inflated). The overall numbers are concerning. And, they vary considerably by state. To visualize this, my colleague Zara Matheson of the Martin Prosperity Institute mapped the variations for the percent of adults who reported meeting the guidelines for aerobic exercise, muscle-strengthening exercise, and both together. The first map, below, shows the overall pattern for aerobic exercise. As you can see, participation in aerobic exercise is most prevalent along the West Coast, in the Rocky Mountain states and the northeast, and far less so in the middle and southern portions of the country. Colorado tops the list among states, with 61.8 percent of adults meeting the standard for aerobic exercise; Oregon is second (61.1 percent), followed by Vermont (59.2 percent), Hawaii (58.5 percent) and California (58.2 percent). On the flip side, the lowest levels of participation in aerobic exercise are found in southern states – Tennessee (39 percent), Mississippi (40 percent), Louisiana (42 percent), Alabama (42.4 percent) and West Virginia (43 percent). The second map shows the results for muscle-strengthening exercises. The map shows a similar pattern, with higher participation in muscle-strengthening in the West, the Rocky Mountains, and northeast and lower levels in the interior and the South. D.C. now tops the list (36.1 percent – though as always, D.C.'s presence on state lists is complicated by being a 100 percent urban area).
Ranking the states, Colorado is in second (35.6 percent), followed by Alaska (33.8 percent), Virginia (33.4 percent) and Arizona (32.5 percent). Conversely, West Virginia (20.2 percent), Tennessee (20.6 percent), Oklahoma (23.8 percent), Mississippi (23.9 percent) and Louisiana (23.9 percent) have the lowest levels of participation. And finally the third map, below, charts the states whose residents score the highest on both types of exercise. Again, the highest levels are in the West and Rocky Mountain states and the northeast, with the lowest levels concentrated in the interior and South. Colorado is again first, followed by D.C. (26.3 percent), Alaska (25 percent), Arizona (24.2 percent), Hawaii (23.7 percent) and California (23.7 percent). On the flip side, West Virginia (12.7 percent), Tennessee (12.7 percent), Mississippi (14.2 percent), Alabama (15 percent) and Louisiana (15.5 percent) have the lowest levels of participation. • • • • • What factors lie behind these geographical patterns?

To get at this, my MPI colleague Charlotta Mellander ran a basic correlation analysis on participation in exercise and a number of key socioeconomic, demographic and health factors. I report the correlations for combined aerobic and muscle-strengthening, but the pattern for the two types of exercise individually is similar. As always, I note that correlation does not equal causation. You might think people would exercise more in warmer, sunnier states. But that's not the case. As the maps suggest, both forms of exercise are highly correlated with one another. States where people participate more in aerobic exercise also have higher levels of muscle strengthening (the correlation between the two is .81). Also not surprisingly, states where people exercise more also have significantly lower levels of obesity and smoking, two known causes of preventable deaths. Mellander found substantial negative associations between exercise levels and obesity (-.80) and smoking (-.63). You might think people would exercise more in warmer, sunnier states. But that's not the case. They found a negative correlation (-.38) between yearly average temperature and exercise across the 50 states. Exercise levels also correspond to wealth and affluence, with substantial positive correlations to both income (.65) and wages (.64). States where people exercise more are also more highly educated, with a significant correlation (.68) to the share of adults who are college graduates. And exercise levels are higher in states with more post-industrial economies, as participation was highly positively correlated with the share of knowledge, professional and creative workers (.51) and negatively correlated with the share of blue-collar workers (-.65). Fitness participation also tracks the nation's red/blue divide, being positively associated with the share of Obama voters (.51) and negatively associated with Romney voters (-.53). Exercise also hews closely to America's religious divide. People in more religious states exercise less (the correlation between religiosity and exercise is -.69). • • • • • Writing in The Atlantic a couple of years ago, I noted that the physical fitness of our cities and metro areas is geographically spiky, and that "healthy or unhealthy lifestyles... are inextricably tied up with the nature and structure of our culture and society." The fault lines of our economic geography shape our destiny: income, education, and social class influence everything from partisan preference to health. Exercise, it seems, is no exception. "America's increasingly uneven geography of fitness," I concluded, "is perhaps the most visible symbol of its fundamental economic and class divide." This more recent report provides further evidence for this unhappy state of affairs. All maps by MPI's Zara Matheson based upon CDC report data. Top image courtesy Shutterstock.com/Skydive Erick.
The 2015 Rugby Championship was the fourth edition of the expanded annual southern hemisphere Rugby Championship consisting of Argentina, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand.
The 2015 Championship was a shorter competition than normal, with each team playing each other once, rather than twice (home and away). This was so that teams had a longer preparation time ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup which started on 18 September. However, New Zealand hosted an additional match against Australia in Auckland on 15 August which acted as the second Bledisloe Cup test and as a World Cup warm-up.[1] Argentina hosted a second match against South Africa on the same date.
The tournament was known for sponsorship reasons as The Castle Rugby Championship in South Africa, The Investec Rugby Championship in New Zealand, The Castrol Edge Rugby Championship in Australia and The Personal Rugby Championship in Argentina.
Australia won the Championship, becoming just the second team to win the tournament since 2012.[2][3] However, including the previous format of the Championship, Australia claimed the title for the first time since 2011, and achieved a 100% win rate for the first time ever in either format.[4][5]
South Africa finished bottom of the table for the first ever time in the Rugby Championship, with Argentina moving out of that position for the first ever time since their inclusion in 2012.[6] South Africa however, did finish bottom of the previous format in 2011. This was also the first ever year that South Africa failed to record a single win in either the Rugby Championship or Tri Nations Series.[7]

Last week I visited and gave two lectures at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Among other things I had the great pleasure of spending time with Ryan Murphy who is a Research Assistant Professor at the O'Neil Center for Global Markets and Freedom at SMU and I had the opportunity to talk to Ryan about a new paper that has just been published.
The hypothesis in the paper Aggregate Demand Shortfalls and Economic Institutions essentially is that a sharp drop in aggregate demand over a period will cause a change in political climate and sentiment, which in turn will cause policymakers to implement policies, which undermines economic freedom.
This of course is very close to what I often have been arguing namely that a failure on part of central banks to keep nominal spending growth (aggregate demand) “on track” can cause an increase in populist sentiment, which in turns leds to bad policies, which likely will have negative supply side consequences.
Ryan has co-authored the paper with Taylor Leland Smith of Texas Tech University. Here is the abstract:
Political instability is often exacerbated in periods of aggregate demand shortfall, with both short and long-term implications for economic institutions. It has been conjectured that inadequate policy responses to recessions may be inimical to free economic institutions. This paper uses the Economic Freedom of the World index as its measure of economic institutions, and finds that the change in economic freedom in the following five, ten, and fifteen years is negatively impacted by an aggregate demand shortfall as measured by negative NGDP growth. The result is (largely) robust upon the exclusion of the monetary policy variables from Economic Freedom of the World, but is not robust if economic institutions are measured as trade openness
I think the paper is great and very innovative in its approach to analyzing the connection between monetary policy failure and Economic Freedom.
I have suggested to Ryan that they should expand the study to cover the 1930s as I think that they will be able to show that exactly the same kind of mechanisms where in place during that period. The only problem of course is that we don't have an Index for Economic Freedom of World in the 1930s…

The planning staff of President Joachim Gauck could not have chosen a better destination than Philadelphia for Germany's head of state to start their first official visit to the United States exactly 25 years after the country's unification. Philadelphia, where the Declaration of Independence was signed, for Americans, stands as a symbol for the country's hard-won freedom after the Revolutionary War against Britain. It was also where - on October 6, 1683 - a first group of Mennonite settlers from Krefeld founded Germantown - today, a neighborhood of the city.
But there is also another German connection. It comes via Philadelphia's Liberty Bell, a large historic bell that first served as an icon of US freedom and independence, but during the Cold War became a larger symbol of the struggle for freedom from communist rule in Eastern Europe. In 1950, Berlin received its own Freedom Bell, an American gift still located in what then was the city hall of West Berlin.
Rich with symbolism
"That's a pretty powerful image," said Scott Lucas, a professor of American Studies at the University of Birmingham.
"There is a big emphasis in underlining the linkages between Germany and the United States on the issue of freedom and liberty," noted Josef Janning, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. For President Gauck, a former pastor and civil rights activist in East Germany, freedom and liberty have a very personal relevance, they added. "That's why they go to Philadelphia."
The Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia
But beyond the reflection on Germany's unification and America's indispensable role in it in Philadelphia, Gauck will also meet US President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and important members of Congress in Washington – not the norm for a head of state with a largely ceremonial role.
New roles
"In many ways the Germans are the de-facto leader of Europe despite the fact that the British would like to claim the role," said Lucas. That's why, "it makes sense for every American administration to use the symbolic and informal ways to strengthen that relationship," explained Janning.
But while both Germans and Americans routinely pay lip-service to the importance of German-American relations, the reality often does not live up to the highfalutin' rhetoric so often employed.
"The question for me besides all the symbolism is what is the significance of German-US ties now," said Lucas. Notwithstanding Berlin's leading role in the Ukraine and Greek crises, Germany is still looking to find its role in the 21st century and has not been able to express a clear vision of what European power can and should do, they said.
Similarly, Germans and Europeans are confused about the wisdom and future of US foreign policy, not just under George W. Bush, but also under Barack Obama, particularly in the Middle East, said Janning. The NSA spying scandal also did not help to rebuild lost trust.
Gap between rhetoric and reality
President Gauck has called on Germany to play a bigger role internationally
"So the relationship is underperforming, measured against the significance both countries assign to the other side," said Janning.
President Gauck, however, due to the largely symbolic role they play in German politics, won't be able to improve the alleged underperformance of the German-American relationship. But if the past is any indicator, they may not shy away from highlighting the deficits therein and offering suggestions as to what may be done about them.
Shū Hirose's Grisaia no Kajitsu ~Sanctuary Fellows~ manga adapting Frontwing's The Fruit of Grisaia (Le Fruit de la Grisaia) visual novel ended on Tuesday with an announcement that a new series based on the visual novel's sequel, The Labyrinth of Grisaia (Grisaia no Meikyū/Le Labyrinthe de la Grisaia) , will begin on December 16 in Akita Shoten's Champion Cross online magazine.
The manga adapting the original visual novel with art by Shū Hirose and scripts by Frontwing's Eiji Narumi began in Akita Shoten's Champion Red Ichigo last year, but the magazine ceased publication in August this year. The manga has since run online in Champion Cross . The fourth and final compiled volume will ship on December 19.
Sekai Project is planning a KickStarter to bring all three visual novels in the series to the West.
An anime adaptation of the original visual novel also began last month. Crunchyroll is streaming the anime as it airs in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks has licensed the series for North American release.
NEW DELHI: The customs department has unearthed a new modus operandi of sending demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes abroad by courier in a bid to get them converted here later.After these high denomination notes were taken out of circulation by the government in November last, Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) were given a longer window till June 30 to get them exchanged, whereas citizens who were in the country at that time were allowed to deposit the old notes till December 30, 2016.Customs officials have registered a few cases, where demonetised banknotes were sent abroad by courier, and seized over Rs 1 lakh in such notes, a senior official said today.People were found trying to send the old notes abroad by falsely declaring them as articles such as books, they said."The aim could be to take help of their relatives or friends abroad to get the old notes exchanged with the new ones," the official said.In two cases, couriers were booked from Punjab for Australia and the content inside them were declared as book.The customs official, who are keeping an eye on outbound parcels at foreign post office here, found them having demonetised notes.Similar consignments were booked for Korea and the United Arab Emirates containing the defunct notes. "In all, over Rs 1 lakh in old currency notes were seized from these couriers," they said.Such cases have also been registered at foreign post offices located across the country, the official said.After scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 8, the government had permitted people to deposit them in banks up to December 30, 2016.The RBI has allowed Indian citizens, who were abroad during November-December 2016, to exchange the scrapped notes up to March 31 and NRIs up to June 30.This facility is available at RBI offices in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Nagpur only.NRIs coming to India are required to come through Red Channel disclosing to the Customs authorities at the airport the amount of the demonetised notes and secure a certificate to be tendered at the RBI at the time of exchange.

The police reported that this operation is part of a series of both overt and covert ones in Jerusalem and in the region.
"The Israel Police will work hard against anyone who chooses to attack uniformed personnel wherever they are, as well as those who attack police officers while carrying out operational activity," the police announced in a statement.
There is no better cabinet minister in the Trudeau government than Ralph Goodale. He's intelligent, industrious and savvy in the intricacies of Parliament and the Constitution — a sort of lineal descendant of the late Allan MacEachen and Eugene Forsey.
Goodale worked as hard in Opposition, and then as an MP in the third party days, as they did when they were finance minister — a true rarity in politics. Usually, those who have governed can never quite get used to carrying their own luggage once the chauffeur is gone. The work ethic has a way of vanishing along with the perks.
Not so with Goodale. There was a reason they survived the Liberals' collapse, the decade in the political wilderness after AdScam. He's a worker bee, no matter how small the hive — and the people of their Regina-Wascana riding know it.
When the worm turned and the Liberals came back to power, I for one took comfort from the fact that Goodale ended up as Public Safety minister. I felt that way because I knew they would be the one in charge of remaking one of the worst pieces of legislation ever passed in Canada: Bill C-51.
It would be a hard task. The Liberals had a lot to answer for over this bill. It was appropriately described as a ‘police state manifesto' that walked all over the Charter of Rights in hobnailed boots. It greatly and gratuitously increased police power. It extended vast new privacy-invading powers to a security establishment that had never even asked for them. You could not conceive of a less Canadian bill.
And yet, when they were facing an election, Justin Trudeau voted for it. They didn't want the governing Conservatives going into the 2015 election claiming they were ‘soft on terror' — perhaps the most abused phrase in the political lexicon these days. Paradox: They voted for something they were against.
But Trudeau attached an important caveat to their support. If elected, they said, they would amend C-51 to do away with some of the legislation's darker aspects — the ones directly inspired by a series of ministerial directives that preceded C-51 under the Stephen Harper government.
The darkest one came from Goodale's predecessor at Public Safety, Vic Toews. They signed a secret ministerial directive in 2011 authorizing the use of information obtained through torture. That directive permitted our civilian spy agency to share information with foreign governments even in cases where there was “a substantial risk” of triggering torture against an individual.
Theoretical, you say? It's as theoretical as Maher Arar's case was back in 2002.
The Harper government also ordered the Canadian military to share information with allies, even when that likely would lead to torture. More Canadian values.
DND became the fifth federal agency to receive such orders under the Conservatives. The others were CSIS, the RCMP, the Canadian Border Services and what was then known as Communications Security Establishment Canada, Canada's international and (as it turned out) domestic electronic eavesdropping service.
Although the Liberals conducted a review of the entire national security file in re-working Bill C-51 into Bill C-59, the heart of the matter was the question of what they would do about the torture issue. And there, the redoubtable Ralph Goodale notwithstanding, they have failed. At least, they have if their latest ministerial directives lay out the path the government has chosen.
I'm not saying Goodale didn't improve on C-51 with their new directives. They did. National security agencies will have to report on compliance matters to a national security committee of parliamentarians. There is a prohibition against disclosing information to a foreign country that poses a “substantial” risk of encouraging torture. And there is a “ban” on using information derived from torture.
Or is there?
Instead of unequivocally banning torture — as the Geneva Conventions do, as the U.S. Supreme Court did when it agreed that the Conventions held for all detainees in U.S. custody — Goodale invoked the principle that guided Toews to their calamitous thumbs-up for torture.
If you allow yourself to use information derived from torture, you're not combatting the use of torture. You're promoting it. If you allow yourself to use information derived from torture, you're not combatting the use of torture. You're promoting it.
The language is more euphonious, and the spooks have to go through more quasi-public process before they can act. But the bottom line is the same: Under certain circumstances, the Canadian security establishment can use information obtained by torture.
What is that but a re-worded version of the “exceptional circumstances” dodge the Conservatives used to justify using information obtained by torture? If you allow yourself to use information derived from torture, you're not combatting the use of torture. You're promoting it.
Apologists for the position adopted by the Liberals and the Conservatives before them like to paint that argument as naive. They often describe a clichéd ticking-time-bomb scenario, an instance where the end justifies the means.
Martin Robbins put this argument best in The Guardian, “If mutilating John Doe's balls is going to stop a nuclear bomb going off in my favorite London pub, then hand me the curling tongs.”
Ah, a clear dog-whistle to the bloody-minded MAGA crowd. But … what if authorities have the wrong person?
What if the person they have in custody doesn't actually possess the information they believe they have?
What if the individual is the right person and has the needed information, but there's a better way of getting it out him? Better than, say, ‘walling', or waterboarding them 183 times (as was done to Khalid Shaikh Muhammad), or electric shock, sleep and sensory deprivation or attack dogs?
What if torture doesn't work? Doctors Raj Persaud and Peter Bruggen concluded that it doesn't, after surveying professional interrogators in the U.S. and other countries.
In fact, no modern advocate of torture has proved that Inquistion tactics do what their practitioners desire — unless you believe the multiple lies told by the CIA. The U.S. Senate didn't believe them. The Obama government spent $40 million looking into the efficacy of the CIA's torture program since 9/11. What it found was awful.
The CIA lied about its secret gulag of black torture sites, lied about the number of detainees it held, lied about its extraordinary rendition program, lied about the innocent lives they claimed torture had saved.
It even lied about the role torture played in the search for al Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden, claiming “enhanced interrogation” had revealed the name of Bin Laden's courier.
The director of the CIA at that time, Leon Panetta, informed Senator John McCain that that story was false. The information about the courier had actually been obtained using “standard, non-coercive means.”
In the final, massive and damning report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, senators came to this conclusion: “The use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or gaining detainee cooperation … The interrogations of CIA detainees was brutal and far worse than the CIA represented to policymakers and others.”
The US Army Training Manual, now the Bible for U.S. security agencies on the matter of torture, concurs:
“The use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say whatever they think the interrogator wants to hear.”
Ali Soufan, who interrogated many al Qaida members as a special agent for the FBI, backed up that assertion in Time Magazine:
“When they are in pain, people will say anything to get the pain to stop. Most of the time, they will lie, make up anything to make you stop hurting them. That means the information you are getting is useless.”
One of the few remaining advocates of torture — a person who “absolutely” believes that it works — is Donald Trump. Remember when candidate Trump pledged in a TV debate to bring back waterboarding and “worse”? When they said they would like to order U.S. troops to kill the families of terrorists? And that if they gave such an order — which would be wildly illegal under both domestic and international law — the troops would obey him?
Even Trump got whiplash from reversing their position 24 hours later, after 100 prominent Republicans, national security members and Pentagon officials described their comments as “inexcusable.” One of those people is their current defense secretary — the former head of U.S. Central Command, General John Mattis.
Legally and morally, torture should never be in Canada's intelligence toolkit — even if it is performed by surrogates whose information we merely use.
President Barack Obama observed after receiving the Senate report that the CIA's torture program did “significant damage” to America's reputation. Secretary of State John Kerry said that a country “doesn't have to choose between protecting our security and promoting our values.”
Until Ralph Goodale and the Trudeau government tell us why they have left open the dreadful, degrading option of encouraging torture, they're offering us nothing more than a better-paved road to the same goal Mr. Harper sought: extracting unreliable information through pain.

Maryland legislators and contract farmers hired by companies to grow chickens are proposing the Poultry Litter Management Act that would require major animal agriculture companies to pay the cost of properly disposing excess manure on their contract farms.
“It's a fairness issue, it has an adverse impact on our environment and we need to clean it up,” said Sen. Joan Carter Conway, D-Baltimore, “and those individuals who are making the mess need to clean up the mess.”
The bill, SB496, is a response to what many environmentalists describe as major chicken companies getting a “free ride” as they produce around 228,000 tons of excess manure in the state each year but are not mandated to pay for the environmental costs of moving that waste.
“I don't know if people realize that the 300-plus million chickens raised annually on Maryland's Eastern Shore create more waste than everyone else who lives in Maryland,” said Sen. Richard Madaleno, D-Montgomery, lead sponsor of the bill.
Perdue pushes back
Julie DeYoung, a spokesperson for Perdue Farms, pushed back against the notion that the company — an animal agriculture business based in Salisbury that contracts with 265 poultry producers in the state — requires their contract farms to pay to dispose poultry litter.
“For nearly 15 years through our Perdue AgriRecycle organic fertilizer facility, we have been the only poultry company in the Chesapeake Bay region that provides an environmentally responsible alternative to land application,” DeYoung wrote in an e-mail. “Those who claim that Perdue is putting the responsibility for poultry litter on our farmers are choosing to ignore this fact.”
The cost of removing the manure, and subsequent runoff into the Chesapeake Bay, has traditionally been shifted to contract farmers and taxpayers, lawmakers and environmental advocates said Tuesday.
Since 1999, more than $5.6 million from taxpayers have been used to move excess manure off contract operations that are unable to handle the animal waste, according to a report from the state's Department of Agriculture. This includes $2.8 million alone for major chicken processor Perdue since 2008, according to the state's Department of Budget and Management.
Maryland taxpayers have contributed $767 million to clean up the bay since 2004, according to a report from the Maryland Bay Restoration Fund Advisory Committee.
Former contract farmer supports the bill, Farm Bureau doesn't
Carol Morison, who was previously a poultry farmer spoke in favor of the bill. Morison said they are now an “independent farmer” who produces fresh eggs, which they “sells to Whole Foods in Annapolis.” (CORRECTED Morison with one R)
They also acknowledged that they had once been “part of the problem,” largely because the company for which they worked backed them into a corner and effectively made them solely responsible for waste disposal. However, Morison subsequently explained that as a contractor the company owned the chickens, not them
“We're not taking away any fertilizers” or “valuable things that farmers use for growing tools.”
Responding to the proposal, Katie Ward, communications specialist for the Maryland Farm Bureau, declined to comment on the bill directly, but said, “We do believe the concept is premature.”
“We are only in the first of a two-year analysis provided in the [Phosphorus Management Tool] regulations to determine the extent of the need to find new uses for poultry litter. Early analysis from the Maryland Department of Agriculture shows fewer acres will be impacted than originally presumed.”
“We also urge all concerned stakeholders to put time and effort into developing and supporting alternative use technology,” Ward said. “That is what we should be spending our time on in 2016.”

If Bluetooth isn't enabled, it can sometimes cause a force close.
If the Bluetooth signal isn't good enough the app might get stuck on initialization.
If the phone goes to sleep the Bluetooth connection doesn't re-initialize properly (for now the program won't let the phone sleep)
You need to pair with your bluetooth device BEFORE running the program. The program only queries for already bonded devices.

Two men were rushed to the hospital from Dolores Park Thursday, after two different crimes led to their injury.
According to the San Francsico Police Department, officers were called to the park at 4:30 p.m. Thursday, after a 22-year-old man was struck over the head with a bottle.
Police say that the victim had been told that a third party had been robbed, so the victim approached the robbery suspect on the robbery victim's behalf.
Over the course of the confrontation, the alleged robber smashed a bottle over the head of the man calling them out regarding the alleged crime.
The bashed man was transported to San Francisco General Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries sustained in the attack. The suspect, regarding whom the police did not provide any details, remains at large.
Police were back at the park at 9 p.m., when a shooting was reported on the park's northeastern tip at 18th and Dolores Streets.
In that case, police say that a 29-year-old man was approached by two male suspects in their 20s, one of whom asked them for a cigarette. The victim said they didn't smoke, at which point the same man asked them for a lighter.
When the victim pulled out their lighter to lend to the man, the suspect "pulled out a handgun" police say. The victim "grabbed onto the handgun, when a struggle ensued."
Over the course of the struggle, the second suspect pulled the victim's wallet from their pants pocket. "At this time the handgun discharged," police say, striking the victim. The suspects fled the scene on foot, according to the SFPD, stolen wallet in hand,
The victim was transported to San Francisco General Hospital to be treated for the gunshot wound, which police say is not life-threatening.
As with the earlier attack, the suspects remain on the loose. According to the SFPD, no arrests have been made in either case.

Boehner doesn't appear to be going along with their Republican counterparts in the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is looking to avert a shutdown by offering Democrats a clean funding bill for DHS. The speaker would not say whether they would back a Senate funding bill without provisions that would defund President Obama's executive actions on immigration. At one point, Boehner blew kisses at reporters after they asked whether they would.
“We passed a bill to fund the department six weeks ago. Six weeks ago!” the House speaker said during a press conference Thursday. “It's time for the Senate to act. How many times do I have to say it?”
With less than two days to go before a Homeland Security Department shutdown, John Boehner isn't blinking.
Boehner also broke out one of their classic lines, which they used during the October 2013 government shutdown: “If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, every day would be Christmas.”
McConnell had attempted to push through a House-passed funding bill four times, but Senate Democrats blocked it each time because of the immigration language.
“Yesterday, the White House press secretary said that this was a fight amongst Republicans. It is not a fight amongst Republicans,” Boehner said on Thursday. “All Republicans agree that we want to fund the Department of Homeland Security and we want to stop the president's actions in response to immigration.”
McConnell and Boehner spoke with each other on Wednesday for the first time in two weeks. Boehner now has two options: amend the Senate legislation to include immigration language and send it back, or bring a vote to the floor in hopes of avoiding a shutdown.
On Thursday, when asked whether they feel that their speakership is being challenged, Boehner said: “No, heaven's sakes, no. Not at all.”
Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has been making the rounds on the Hill this week, urging lawmakers to keep their department open. Funding for DHS expires at midnight Friday, and the department has begun notifying the employees that would face furloughs during a shutdown.
In Afghanistan, girls are not supposed to obtain an extensive education, be in public without a male chaperone, or work outside the home. This is typically discussed as a burden for girls and women but, as an article in the New York Times sent in by Dmitriy T.M. explains, it can also be a burden on families. Families with sons can send all of their children out in public with the boy as a chaperone. This is useful for the whole family: the girls get more freedom and the parents can send their children on errands, to school, or on social visits without their supervision. Since boys can also work outside the home, boys can be a source in extra income for a family. Families with all girls, then, are not only pitied from a social perspective (because girls are devalued compared to boys), but from a practical perspective (because gendered rules make daily life more difficult).
One solution is to bend the rules. Journalist Jenny Nordberg explains that some families without sons pick a girl-child to be a boy. One day they cut their hair, change their name, and put them in boy clothes. They then send them out into the world as a boy. er mother explains:
People came into our home feeling pity for us that we don't have a son… And the girls — we can't send them outside. And if we changed Mehran to a boy we would get more space and freedom in society for them And we can send them outside for shopping and to help the father.
Them father concurs:
It's a privilege for me, that they are in boys' clothing… It's a help for me, with the shopping. And they can go in and out of the house without a problem.
The practice isn't new, but long-standing.
Nordberg is unsure how many families do this, but it is common enough that most people are unsurprised when a biological girl suddenly becomes a social boy before their very eyes. Teachers have become accustomed to such sudden shifts. Relatives, friends, and acquaintances accept and participate in the farce. There is even a name for this kind of child, “bacha posh,” which translates into “dressed up as a boy.” Later, when the child reaches puberty, they typically become a girl again. Meanwhile, the family might choose a younger sibling to take over them role.
One of the interesting things about this, from a sociological perspective, is how easy it turns out to be to break these extremely rigid gender rules. If the family simply decided that their daughter should be able to go outside without supervision, get higher education, work outside the home, and interact as an equal with men, it would be a slap in the face of the gender regime. By dressing them a boy, however, they are effectively nodding to the rules, even as they break them. They are saying, “Yes, it is true that girls should not be able to do this thing,” but we need a boy in the household for social and practical reasons. And, because other Afghanis understand, they are willing to look the other way.
These sorts of adaptations are often lost when we hear about the cultural rules in places we deem oppressive. People in these narratives often seem unbelievably oppressed. Often they are living under extreme conditions, but it's important to also be exposed to the ways in which individuals find ways to wrest autonomy from rigid rules through ingenuity and creativity. This wresting of autonomy, further, is often part and parcel of the culture, allowing for far more flexibility than outside observers are sometimes capable of seeing.
The men behind the legends of The Tyler sandwich, The Andrew hot dog and the Baseball Special smoothie can still be found roaming around campus.
During the past year, Rick's Diner, Pauly Dogs and Quenchers-three popular campus eateries-have each named a menu item after a few regular customers.
"Tyler came in here on a Friday night... and told one of our third shift cooks, Jermaine, to make the biggest club sandwich they could," said Vincent Brown, general manager of Rick's Diner. "Tyler even set their own price for the sandwich-$20."
The way sophomore Tyler Wasieleski tells the story, they originally wanted a challenge to see which cook could make the better sandwich. Only Jermaine Brown, a third-shift cook at Rick's Diner, however, was willing to participate in the endeavor.
"Jermaine was totally down for it, and I'm like, 'Alright let's do this,'"Wasieleski said. "We started throwing on all types of meats... piling it onto one sandwich, and we dubbed it The Tyler sandwich. It's really good, and it's really big."
The original Tyler sandwich was a double club with extra meats. "Jermaine made this enormous sandwich," Vincent Brown said. "Tyler was just so excited. And it took them and three other friends to eat it."
Since that night, the popularity of the sandwich has grown by word of mouth.
"People just come in here and scream, 'Tyler Sandwich,'" Vincent Brown said. "It is a sandwich you will not forget. Trust me."
The Andrew hot dog of Pauly Dogs, however, took junior Andrew Godfrey much longer to create.
"Andrew came by every day since their first-year student year," said Paul Konstanzer, owner and operator of Pauly Dogs. "We tried different toppings-he ended up getting the potato salad everyday and tried different things that go well with potatoes."
After several weeks of trial and error, Godfrey settled on the combination of potato salad, bacon, ranch dressing, Old Bay spice mix and yellow mustard-unofficially naming it The Andrew. When Andrew started getting The Andrew every day, the popularity of the new hot dog spread gradually until its addition to the menu at the beginning of the school year became inevitable.
"I remember last year Pauly added potato salad to their toppings list, and then I just started putting stuff on it," Godfrey said. "He called me one day during finals week and told me that they were going to put it on the menu."
Quenchers, the popular snack shop among athletes in Wilson Gymnasium, has offered the Baseball Special smoothie-cookies and cream with peanut butter and protein powder-on its official menu since last year.
"The baseball team gave me the idea of naming smoothies after sports teams," said Jack Chao, manager of Quenchers. "When kids order a smoothie, it reminds them that there might be a game soon."
The soccer, lacrosse, tennis, track and field and water polo teams have each participated in naming new flavors. The teams will also get the honor of renaming the Chocolate Elvis smoothie.
The new smoothies are available upon request, but they will not appear on the official menu until next month.
Like the smoothies, the Tyler sandwich is still a menu item only for those in the know-although patrons hope it will become a permanent addition to the menu.
"The Tyler Sandwich came into existence the second week we opened back up after summer break," said Vincent Brown. "The students are actually quite happy with it, and they ask for it a lot."
The sandwich, altered slightly from its original form, is now made with three slices of the customer's choice of breads, ham, turkey, roast beef, lettuce, tomato and cheese.
No ordinary Club sandwich, The Tyler covers an entire plate and towers more than five inches in height. The price of the sandwich has since been set at $25.
Sophomore Mark DellaVolpe learned of the sandwich on a visit to Rick's with their roommate, sophomore Travis Nelson.
"We saw a couple of people indulging in a sandwich, and it looked mighty fine," DellaVolpe said. "So we asked them what it was, and they said it was a Tyler sandwich."
DellaVolpe and Nelson immediately ordered the sandwich and finished it with help from a couple of other people.
"I could have finished it myself if I wanted to," DellaVolpe said. "It was the most mind-blowing experience I've had at Duke."
November 8: Trump +5
Conventional wisdom says Trump's a dead duck, and we all know how prescient is conventional wisdom. Only two weeks left until election, and RealClearPolitics (RCP) puts Clinton about 6 points ahead. So confident is Hillary (supposedly) that one newspaper now urges them to divert some from the presidential campaign and help Democrats in Senate and House races. We should be so lucky. Back to the point. Presidential polls are split into two camps: MSM polls and non-MSM polls. They have starkly different characteristics and results. MSM polls come from those you already know, and the companies themselves have already shed their last shred of dignity and objectivity to throw in with Hillary. They also poll in discreet measure (i.e., release a poll whenever they want one to come out).
Non-MSM polls are not as well known but quite accomplished (e.g., Rasmussen, LA Times/USC, IDB/TIPP – the most accurate in 2012 election, by the way). They also poll daily (actually an average of the last three days). Finally, MSM polls consistently show Hillary up by an average of 8%, whereas the non-MSM polls have shown variation based on events and a logical current tightening of the polls down to basically +/-1% or so per candidate (e.g., Trump in the lead right now by 2% in Rasmussen's poll). What if the polls change more favorably for Trump? Great, but I'm not counting that here. What about the 2012 party sampling (or worse) adjustment to data? Have you seen the difference in the candidate's rallies? But so what? I'm not factoring that in, either. No, I'm not talking about poll changes or the supposedly awoken silent majority giant. I'm talking about the Bradley Effect. For those not familiar with the Bradley Effect, it doesn't happen too often. Specifically, it is named after a black L.A. major who ran for California governor against a white man in 1982 (unusual for the times). Bradley was ahead in the polls when, on election day, the exact opposite occurred. They lost. Supposedly the polls were flawed because people did not want to sound racist when polled. The Bradley Effect is not specific to one race, though, nor to race itself. It occurs in unusual times at different magnitude. Can you think of a candidate today whose name causes hush practically anywhere you go? I can: Trump – "The Love that dare not speak its Name." Such uniform pervasive societal and personal pressure not to support Trump has led to the distinct possibility of another Bradley Effect. In essence, Trump has closet Democrat, independent, and – yes – Republican supporters whose support simply does not show up in any poll of either camp. How do I back this up? Simple: I don't. It's a gut feeling, an intuition, a logical conclusion for our times, and a resulting 3 points added onto Rasmussen's current Trump +2%. Therefore, I will now go on record that – even if nothing happens in the polls or sampling of today – Trump will win on November 8 by at least 5%. The man no one said would or could run; the man no one said would make it out of the primaries alive; the man whose epitaph has been written by the MSM so many times, it's even been done literally; the man whom, supposedly, everybody hates...will be president of the United States-elect. Get used to it. Oh, and buy stocks on the market swoon, and dump your debt.
Mad Catz lays off 37% following reports of underperforming Rock Band 4 [Update] Mad Catz is in a strange place, as its seen its sales increase since last year, but because it produced too much Rock Band 4 hardware, the company is now finding itself with tremendous losses.
Update: The layoff figure was originally posted at 63 percent. However, the language of the earnings report ("The plan consists of a reduction in the number of positions across the organization equal to approximately 37% of the total workforce and includes changes at the executive level.") indicates that the reduction figure is actually 37 percent. The headline has been updated to reflect this.
Original story: After most of its executive board abruptly resigned yesterday, the gaming world braced itself for the worst from game publisher/hardware manufacturer Mad Catz. And as expected, the news coming out of today's third quarter earnings report was not good. So the hammer has fallen on a large chunk of the company, with reports coming in that 63 percent of its workforce has been laid off.
Gamasutra has issued the report on Mad Catz's mass layoffs, citing that the company is aiming for a massive restructuring plan. Mad Catz is currently in the midst of a big hardware push, as it prepares to release new arcade sticks for next week's Street Fighter V.
However, the massive losses undergone in Q3 can largely be attributed to underperforming sales from Rock Band 4, which the company took a chance on publishing late last year. The company's sales have actually improved 114 percent year-on-year, but there's a big problem in regards to the overmanufacturing of both the software and the substantially expensive hardware. Because RB4 sold relatively poorly, retailers have been desperate to get rid of the excess inventory that's eating up precious real estate on sales floors. That has led to substantial discounts and, as a result, has eaten away at any profits, taking Mad Catz deep into the red.
The low Q3 numbers are also being attributed to low demand for audio and PC hardware in both European and Asian markets.
PARIS (Reuters) - With encouragement from 150 world leaders ringing in their ears, government negotiators in Paris sought on Tuesday to turn that rhetoric of unity into the text of a global deal to slow climate change.
But as the leaders departed Paris, it became apparent that disagreements which have blocked a deal over four years of lead-up negotiations remain unresolved.
Negotiators from the 195 countries with a place at the table resumed work on a draft text that still runs to more than 50 pages and is riddled with sticky issues to be settled.
The biggest obstacle is money: how to come up with the billions of dollars developing nations need to shift from fossil fuels and adapt to the impacts of climate change.
At Tuesday's technical talks, countries restated their well-known negotiating positions on the question with few hints of compromise.
China's delegate Su Wei “noted with concern” what they called a lack of commitment by the rich to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and help to develop nations with new finance to tackle global warming.
And the group of the 48 least developed countries urged far tougher action to limit rising temperatures.
“It's back to the nitty gritty,” said Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, adding the opening day was “all good but that does not resolve the crunch issues.”
Certainly there was still some hangover of goodwill from Monday, when a parade of leaders stepped to the podium to assert the imperative of getting a deal.
Many delegates said the large turnout of leaders, almost all expressing sympathy for the French people after attacks by Islamic State militants killed 130 in Paris this month, set a less hostile tone than the one that prevailed in the last talks in Copenhagen in 2009.
French President Francois Hollande said they were encouraged by the start of a conference that is planned to run until Dec. 11. “It's set off well but it has to arrive too,” they told reporters.
The mood had also been brightened by major spending announcements, including a plan by India and France to mobilise $1 trillion for solar power for some of the world's poorest people and a private sector initiative led by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to mobilise billions of dollars for new energy research and development.
NO ESCAPING POLITICS
A deal in Paris would be by far the strongest ever agreed to bind both rich and poor nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, which scientists say have blanketed the earth, raised global temperatures and begun upending the planet's climate system.

But Tuesday showed that the Paris talks are still taking place under the shadow of politics-as-usual back home.
In the United States, Republicans have signalled they will oppose authorizing the billions of dollars that President Barack Obama has pledged to help to develop nations adapt to climate change.
In response, Obama told reporters before boarding Air Force One to return to the United States that the impacts of climate change will force any future U.S. president — Democrat or Republican — to act.
“Everybody else is taking climate change really seriously,” they said of world leaders in Paris, adding: “People should be confident that we'll meet our commitments on this.”
Developing nations want the rich to pledge rising amounts beyond the current goal of $100 billion a year by 2020 to help them obtain clean energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change, ranging from more floods to droughts and intense storms.
Other disputes concern how to define a long-term goal for reducing or phasing out fossil fuels this century.
So far, pledges made by 184 countries to curb greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2020, made in the run-up to the Paris summit, are too weak to limit rising global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That is widely viewed as a threshold for dangerous and potentially catastrophic changes in the planet's climate system.
As negotiators grapple with the details, they also appear motivated by the fearful consequences of failing to get an agreement.

“Leaders still have the scars of Copenhagen on their hearts and brains,” said Yvo de Boer, who was the U.N.'s climate chief in Copenhagen.
De Boer, who works for the Global Green Growth Institute, said Monday's big turnout was encouraging for a deal - but acknowledged the challenge ahead.
“The elephant in the room is still financed,” they said.

Soldiers have taken over parts of the capital of the West African state of Guinea-Bissau, reports say.
Heavy gunfire has been heard and soldiers are in control of main roads in the city, Bissau, according to eyewitnesses.
There are also reports of fighting near the residence of outgoing Prime Minister Carlos Gomes.
Mr Gomes came first in an inconclusive presidential election last month, but failed to win outright.
Troops are also reported to have taken control of the national radio station and the ruling party's headquarters.
The whereabouts of Mr Gomes and the interim President, Raimundo Pereira, are currently unknown, reports say.
The second-placed candidate in the March election, former President Kumba Yala, has said they will boycott the run-off vote scheduled for 29 April.
Mr Yala alleged that the election had been fraudulent.
The emergency vote was called after the death in January of President Malam Bacai Sanha, after a long illness.
Guinea-Bissau, an impoverished former Portuguese colony, has been plagued by a long series of coups since gaining independence in 1974.
It has recently become an important staging post for gangs smuggling drugs from Latin America to Europe.

Conservationists have declared 2016 to be the “Year of the Otter” amid fears for the survival of many types of the mammal.
The International Otter Survival Fund (IOSF) has highlighted its plight, fearing that some species are at risk of extinction.
The group believes that efforts to preserve smaller animals should be given a similar status to high profile species such as the panda, tiger, elephant and rhino.
It claims that for every tiger skin found, there are at least 10 otter skins, and that in one recent haul in Tibet there were 778 otter skins recovered.
As recently as 2012, the Japanese otter was officially declared extinct, and nine of the 13 remaining species are in decline.
Official warnings show that five species are classed as “endangered” and two are “vulnerable”, meaning that they are facing a “very high risk” or “high risk” of extinction in the wild.
Even the Eurasian otter, the only species in the UK, is classed as “near threatened”, and in Asia it is believed to be “critically endangered”.
The group said: “People may consider it ‘safe' in Europe but it is declining in some areas here too, so there are very serious problems.
“If we really want to conserve otters we have to create a greater awareness of otters and their importance in the ecosystem and demonstrate how vital they are in wetland habitats.
“They are the ideal environmental indicator species – they use both the land and water habitats and so it is essential that both are in pristine condition. This is important not just for otters but for all species, including our own.”
It added: “One of the problems is that there are so few people working on otters and so IOSF has been holding a series of training workshop for students, park rangers and government officials to encourage the next generation of otter workers.
“In this way we can get reliable data on otters, encourage enforcement of legal protection and develop effective education and public awareness programmes within local communities.
“One of the outcomes of the workshops is a network of local otter workers who can share information and advice and can develop otter conservation programmes together.”
President Trump named a U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic who not only participated in the cover-up of Watergate but beat, drugged and kidnapped the wife Nixon's Campaign Chairman to keep them from informing the public about the true nature of the break-in before voting. It's a disgusting tale of white male privilege, police officers breaking the law and retaliation against a woman who spoke truth to power.
Congress rubber-stamped President Trump's appointment Stephen “Steve” King based on their high-level Republican connections to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and their business partnership with Ryan's brother and Trump's inner circle. (He is not the author of the same name.)
It turns out that King, a 76-year-old former FBI agent, infamously worked as security for disgraced former GOP President Richard Nixon's CREEP (Committee to Re-Elect the President), where they participated in the primary cover-up of Watergate by beating up Martha Mitchell. Newsweek reports:
[Stephen] King played a crucial role in the 1972 Watergate affair—and not a good one. According to several accounts over the years, King helped cover up ties between President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign and the burglars arrested inside the Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate complex—and in a particularly violent fashion. None of that came up during their confirmation hearing. Their duty on the week of the break-in was to protect—and keep a close eye on—Martha Mitchell, the talkative wife of Nixon's campaign director and former attorney general John Mitchell, while the Mitchells were on a campaign swing in California… When they learned that James McCord, the security director of CREEP, who had served as their bodyguard, was among those arrested at the Watergate—and described by their husband as a private security contractor who was “not operating either on our behalf or with our consent”—she picked up the telephone and called a favorite reporter, UPI's Helen Thomas. Enter King. They “rushed into their bedroom, threw them back across the bed, and ripped the telephone out of the wall,” wrote veteran Washington reporter Winzola McLendon in their 1979 biography of Martha Mitchell, to whom they were close. But Thomas was still on the phone and taking notes. “The conversation ended abruptly when it appeared someone took away the phone from their hand,” Thomas reported. “She was heard to say, ‘You just get away.'”
In other words, Trump's new Ambassador Steve King stepped in for CREEP; they unplugged the phone while Martha Mitchell spoke with the UPI's legendary reporter Helen Thomas, and proceeded to beat up the Campaign Chairman's wife!
Amazingly, Steve King managed to completely evade justice for their brutal crimes against Martha Mitchell.
If that wasn't bad enough, America's new Czech Ambassador also has literally no diplomatic experience in the post to which he's been assigned since December 7th.
Years later, Mitchell told a magazine that King had summoned a doctor to administer a tranquilizing shot, before ordering their hotel to hold all phone calls while Nixon's Chief of Staff diabolically spread disinformation to discredit Mitchell in the press as part of the coverup.
Is it any wonder that women were afraid to speak out against men who abused them in the 1970s?
Eventually, convicted Watergate burglar James McCord confirmed King's role in kidnapping Martha Mitchell in 1975, calling them a “political prisoner.” The Times reported their reaction as:
“Thank God somebody is coming to my assistance. I was not only kidnapped but I was threatened at gun point, and you can put that in,” they said in a telephone conversation.
Before there was a #Metoo movement, Republicans discredited a famous battered woman to cover up the Watergate scandal and Donald Trump just installed Nixon's most brutal goon as an American Ambassador.
Ultimately, Richard Nixon themselves admitted that without Martha Mitchell there would not have been a Watergate.
It's bad enough that Steve King used a combination of white privilege, police brutality, and Republican political connections to break the law and get away with being one of Nixon's Watergate enforcers, but it's unconscionable to send them overseas to represent America.
President Trump needs to immediately recall America's Ambassador to the Czech Republic, demand King's resignation and appoint someone qualified who isn't an unindicted Watergate co-conspirator or any other form of criminal.
But nobody should expect our shameless President – best known for bragging about sexual assault – to do anything about the political kidnapper they just sent to Europe to represent our nation.
After all, Trump's disgraced National Security Advisor – and newly convicted felon – has also been accused of formulating a kidnapping plot from the White House.

There's only so much “breaking news.” After more than a week of wall-to-wall coverage on the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, much of it baseless speculation from vaguely defined experts, CNN today resorted to the most baseless of speculation from a certifiable non-expert about what “supernatural” or conspiratorial explanations there could be for the disappearance.
“It's where every conspiracy falls apart: How do you keep everyone quiet?” offered Brad Meltzer, an author of political thrillers and host of the History Channel's Decoded. “I'm glad you brought that up,” said host Don Lemon, who proceeded to make things much stupider.
“Especially today, on a day when we deal with the supernatural, we go to church, the supernatural power of God. You deal with all of that,” said Lemon, making little to no sense. “People are saying to me, why aren't you talking about the possibility — and I'm just putting it out there — that something odd happened to this plane, something beyond our understanding?” Just putting it out there!
Meltzer was more than game to offer nothing of substance. “We all kind of roll our eyes at conspiracy theories, but what conspiracy theories do is they ask the hardest, most outrageous questions sometimes,” they said. “But every once in a while, they're right. And that's what we have to remember here. I think why it's captured our attention is because there's no logical explanation right now.”
“You can say, oh, it crashed into the ocean, but where are the parts? Where are the pieces? Why did it keep going for seven hours? Why do you have a guy onboard who gives their watch and their ring to their wife and says keep this for my boys in case something happens to me?” they continued.
“Something smells wrong,” they concluded, having added negative knowledge. “It just smells terrible. How does a jet liner, with almost 200 people on it, disappear? [Ed. note: There were 239.] How are they just gone?”
“Absolutely, absolutely,” said Lemon. “Absolutely.”
You can get this kind of trenchant analysis 24 hours a day, if you hate yourself.
[1][2] Looking across different US government survey sources, for a given year male adult and youth inmates are estimated to suffer several times more incidents of sexual victimizations than incarcerated females. Male and female inmates are not included in most national surveys of sexual victimization.
Prison rape or jail rape is rape occurring in prison. The phrase has come into common usage to refer to rape of inmates by other inmates, and less commonly to the rape of inmates by staff, and even less commonly rape of staff by inmates.
In the US, the overwhelming majority of cases are men who are raped by other men.[1][2]
In some jurisdictions, sexual contact with inmates by prison staff is illegal regardless of consent.[3]
The well-known teardrop tattoo sometimes signifies that the wearer was raped while incarcerated and tattooed with a teardrop under the eye by the rapist, as a way of “marking” an inmate as the property of another person and humiliating the inmate while in prison, as a tattoo on the face cannot be covered up or hidden.[4][5][6][7]
United States [ edit ]
Public awareness of common prison rape is a relatively recent development and estimates of its prevalence have varied widely for decades. In 1974, Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they held that 10 million would be raped.[8]
A United States Department of Justice report, Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, states that "In 2011–12, an estimated 5.0% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months."[9] However, advocates dispute the accuracy of the numbers, saying they seem to under-report the real numbers of sexual assaults in prison, especially among juveniles.[10]
A 1992 estimate from the Federal Bureau of Prisons conjectured that between 9 and 20 percent of inmates had been sexually assaulted.[8] Studies in 1982 and 1996 concluded that the rate was somewhere between 12 and 14 percent. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23 percent[8] for maximum security prisons in New York. In contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted.[8]
The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 was the first United States federal law passed specifically dealing with the sexual assault of prisoners. The bill was signed into law on September 4, 2003.[11]
Iran [ edit ]
Sexual violence against political prisoners is prevalent in Iran.[12] It is allegedly ignored or even facilitated by authorities.[13]
It is said[by whom?] that rape has been used by interrogators in Iran for decades.[14] During the 1980s, following the Iranian Islamic Revolution, the rape of female political prisoners was so prevalent that it prompted Hussein-Ali Montazeri, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini's then-deputy, to write the following to Khomeini in a letter dated 7 October 1986: "Did you know that young women are raped in some of the prisons of the Islamic Republic?"[15] Two prominent members of Iran's human rights community, the feminist lawyer and journalist Shadi Sadr and the blogger and activist Mojtaba Saminejad published essays online from inside Iran saying prison rape has a long history in the Islamic Republic.[15]
In the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, opposition groups reported thousands were arrested and tortured in prisons around the country, with former inmates alleging mass rape of men, women and children by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards, in prisons such as Kahrizak and Evin.[16][17]
Following the 2009 presidential election, Iranian presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said several protesters held behind bars in Evin Prison had been savagely raped, according to a confidential letter to former president and cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.[18] Karroubi said this was a "fragment" of the evidence they had and that if the denials did not stop, they would release even more.[19][20]
On August 9, 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, Mehdi Karroubi demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible the tortures and, in particular, sexual harassment of men and women.[21][22] On August 19, they wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to "personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak."[23] Ali Larijani and Sadeq Larijani (Judiciary committee) both officially rejected their claims and Ali Khamenei's representatives, and Vice Chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi's arrest.[24][citation needed]
Turkey [ edit ]
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have both released reports of widespread rape and abuse of prisoners in Turkey spanning multiple decades.[25][26] Kurdish prisoners have also been specifically targeted for rape and other forms of sexual violence.[27]

1) to not move, walk, etc., after doing so before 2) to cause (someone or something) to not move, walk, etc., after doing so before 3) to not do something that you have been doing before; to not continue doing something — Merriam-Webster
The Merriam-Webster definition is clear. But it's equally clear that many West Hollywood drivers don't know what that octangular red sign with the white letters S T O P on it actually means.
Data from the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station shows most of the pedestrian accidents that have stirred outrage among local residents are the fault of motorists. If there's any doubt just how obtuse drivers can be at stop signs, it is erased by a several dozen videos that Keith Cohn made on Kings Road near its intersection with Romaine.

One of Pinkie's favorite things.I uh... I binge drew this for 6 hours in one day... Which I'm kind of proud of but kind of kicking myself for, because it looks kinda rushed. Having done most the work in a short span, I overlooked some stuff that I might have caught had I taken a break and came back to it a day later. I lost a bit of the volume and I coulda added a lot more depth to the background, but again I don't want to keep working on it just because I wanna get this sucker out there. I could potentially add some stuff but not without a lot of extra work for minimal gain. So I'm just over here shrugging about it. Such a meh piece for me art skill wise.Fun fact, I actually made this as a gift for a friend of mine, . The original version has an "eytosh" on the balloon.

While you're watching the seconds tic by anxiously waiting for the return of the HBO series Game of Thrones on April 6, President Obama is living high off the hog with exclusive screeners of the show provided to them by its creators.
The co-creators of the show, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, recently confirmed to Vanity Fair's Jim Windolf that yes, the rumors are true: Obama has been given advanced screeners of the upcoming fourth season.
“One perk of being the most powerful man in the world: yes, you get to see episodes early,” the pair said in a joint email.
Just weeks ago, in the depths of the frigid winter of 2014, this writer called on President Obama to order the early release of Game of Thrones, that we might weather the winter storms in the relative comfort of Westeros fantasies.

A JUDGE has told a court that two young mothers involved in a violent row outside a primary school "should behave in a different way and maybe take up knitting".
A JUDGE has told a court that two young mothers involved in a violent row outside a primary school "should behave in a different way and maybe take up knitting".
Judge Patrick Durcan made their comment after imposing two four-month suspended sentences on sisters Rose Mahon (24), of Ballaghboy halting site, Quin Road, Ennis, and Laura Molloy (23) of An Pairc, Bruach na hAbhainn, Ennis, for their role in the daylight row at the Holy Family Junior School in the town on March 20, 2012.
At Ennis District Court, Co Clare, the judge said that they didn't accept that the two were minor players in the drama that unfolded at the school that day "and were as equally guilty as anyone else involved".
As part of the wider incident at 1.45pm on the day, gardai said that as parents collected their small children from the school, Mahon's husband, Conor Mahon, ran across the school playground with a slash-hook along with a 13-year old armed with a machete, giving chase to two others.
The two others, Darren Maughan and Michael Maughan, barricaded themselves into a classroom containing eight five-year-old children and one teacher.
In the incident, Darren Maughan "was afraid for their life and thought they were going to be killed".
At the same time, Ms Mahon and Ms Molloy attacked a Land Rover belonging to Thomas Sherlock outside the school and pleaded guilty to causing €1,500 worth of criminal damage.
Solicitor for the two, Daragh Hassett, said: "There was an attack from another family and they attacked back."
They told the court that Mr Mahon and the teenager had already been dealt with before Ennis Circuit Court through a mix of suspended sentence and adjournment.
The judge said: "If (the women) want to get their housing problems sorted, they should behave in a different way and maybe take up knitting or something like that."

When Tomb Raider—the reboot of the game franchise with which it shares a name—came out earlier in March, many a column inch was devoted to Lara Croft's evolution from archaeological adventurer to concerningly capable killer. Rather fewer were given over to the use of apocalyptic artwork, invisible cameramen, birth metaphors, and emotional color palettes. To redress the balance, Wired.co.uk quizzed Brian Horton, Senior Art Director at Crystal Dynamics, on all of the above and then a little bit more.
The Tomb Raider games are iconic—how do you even get started reworking a game with such a strong visual legacy?
As a fan of the classic games, I played Tomb Raider 1 and 2 again to remember why I loved them so much. Lara Croft was a confident and totally capable anti-hero, but they didn't have much room to grow in ability or characterization.
Our concept was a simple one that allowed us to rework Lara's look and abilities; an inexperienced Lara Croft on their first expedition, their ship crashes on an island and they must do whatever it takes to survive. To believe in this survival story, we grounded Lara, and their world, making both as realistic as we could.
We removed Lara's experience and confidence but we retained their intelligence, curiosity, and determination. These changes gave us room to allow them to grow as a character. It was exciting and scary at the same time, we knew it would be a bold change for Tomb Raider and we were happy with the positive reception when we announced the reboot in 2009.
OK, so in terms of Lara herself, how did them look progress and how did you know when you'd got it right?
Lara's look took a lot of exploration and iteration. Lara went through many incarnations, at one point they had a more classic look with a young girl as a companion—she even had a monkey as a helper in one version!
Brenoch Adams (Art Director) and I went through the design process together. We were inspired by characters in films and TV, like Ellen Ripley from Aliens, Kate from Lost, John Rambo from First Blood, and even John McClane from Die Hard. All of these heroes relate to a common theme; they are real people in a horrible survival situation. They get hurt and express emotion, but find the inner strength to keep moving and prevail.
We wanted this young Lara to look like a girl you knew while retaining some of the iconic qualities of Lara Croft. We made their body frame more petite, their face less chiseled, and their clothes are practical, with dual tank tops, cargo pants, and boots. We retained some iconic elements, like their brown eyes, their "M" shaped upper lip and the ponytail. We did a focus test on the final concept and it tested very well, most people were more drawn to their face than they were to their body.
To bring the concept to life, we purchased real clothes and hired two models to scan, one for the body and one for the face. This was just a foundation for us to achieve the believability, our Principal Character Artist, Kam Yu, refined this data over the course of a month to finalize the model you see in the game today.
There were hints of The Hunger Games and Katniss Everdeen in Lara's look too although I gather that was coincidental. Do you think they both tap into a how we are trying to portray women at the moment or is it something else entirely?
We weren't even aware of The Hunger Games when we finalized Lara's look and the bow as their new signature weapon.
I do think this happens in our culture, where themes emerge from different places and seem to connect. We feel Lara is one of the most influential female heroes in all media, but we knew the 90s represented different values for a hero. Our interpretation is in line with what we like to see in our heroes today, flaws are as important as strengths.
In terms of visual reference points what were your inspirations, either in terms of other games or in terms of artworks? I thought I detected a touch of John Martin apocalyptica in the opening sections...
For inspiration we looked at movies like Apocalypse Now and The Descent. They have a dark beauty to them that we wanted to capture in Tomb Raider. The John Martin painting is amazing and while not an immediate reference, it was in line with the paintings we were inspired by from Turner, Bierstadt, and Church. They created some of the most amazing natural wonders that look beautiful but ominous; showing how nature can be scary. These influences were the foundation of bringing personality to the island of Yamatai.
How did you reflect the "Survivor is Born" theme visually?
The beginning of the game is kind of a metaphor for their birth; they struggle out of the darkness of the caverns and emerges to the light of the cliff side. This is their birth, she's thrust into this situation and they can't go back. Them evolution through the game is a continuation of this journey, they have to confront their fears and keep moving forward.
As well as the sympathetic geography, changes in color palette are linked to Lara's character evolution. Could you explain a bit more about how that works?
We use color as a way to express emotion. These colors will change and evolve throughout the story to reflect Lara's state of mind. For instance, we start the game in cool tones—the fire is the one source of light and warmth, and this represents the player's hope, as well as a tool for survival. Then at the end of the level we take away the fire as they scramble up the muddy incline, a pinhole of light closes in as the cave starts to crumble until we go to black. When Lara emerges she's bathed in warm light.
It's a deliberate color choice to provide relief and accomplishment. The audio team takes these cues to create music and sound that complement these emotions perfectly, with dissonant percussion in the caverns, and a piano as they emerge onto the cliff path.
I noticed you used a fair amount of lens flare and water effects—why do you think we like to be reminded of a camera that technically doesn't exist?
We wanted this game to be presented as if it were a documentary of their first adventure. Effects like lens flares, dirt, water, and blood splashes on the lens add aesthetics to this documentary, further immersing players into our fictional world. Remi Lacoste is the genius behind the cinematography in this game and their camera performance complemented this vision and brought the virtual cameraman to life.
How did you translate the violence and emotion of the first kill into a visual experience?
We wanted to express the gravity of death through gameplay. We started this with a deer, which Lara has to kill to survive. They have empathy for the deer before they harvest it for food; it's a sacrifice they have to make to survive. When she's confronted with wolves, they will not hesitate to kill Lara so they must take an aggressive stance to survive them. Finally, we present the player with a human, but a sadistic, amoral enemy: we deliberately want the player to feel disgust, and a palpable sense of menace.
The moment where Lara has to kill a human for the first time must feel justified, but also powerful and revelatory: this moment changes her, and from that point on they and the player understand that killing is the only way they can survive the insanity of this island.
Were there any ideas you loved but couldn't make work?
There are a lot of ideas that we really like that didn't make the game. Some of them would fit into the new format, some, while cool, will never quite work. For instance we had an epic battle on the beach level that had Lara fending off a siege of Solarii with a mounted machinegun. While fun, it didn't really fit their character and upped the kill count to unrealistic proportions. We spent a lot of time on it, but cut it because it didn't fit the game.
What are you proudest of in relation to the game?
The team is proud of the game we made. Even before it hit retail we knew it was the best game we could make. We sacrificed time away from family to ensure it was true to our vision, looked great, and was fun to play. This kind of game doesn't come around often, and I'm honored to have been a part of it.
Maybe The Freeze isn't a superhuman, after all. The Atlanta Braves costumed sensation made a name for themselves this season by racing contestants between innings — giving their opponents a massive head start and still (usually) winning.
But unfortunately, they couldn't make the magic last at the 2017 MLB All-Star Game Tuesday night.

Drat — and just like that, a hero falls. Congratulations to the speedy fan who took them down, but it's always hard to see beloved heroes like The Freeze lose their touch. After all, some kid was out there, watching excitedly in their Freeze costume, holding their Freeze action figure ... only to watch their favorite hero get dusted by some fan.
And yes, The Freeze has lost before — but the stakes were so much higher tonight. This was the gosh dang All-Star Game and The Freeze had their chance to prove they were an All-Star.
Things might not have gone as planned, but you're still an All-Star in my eyes, The Freeze.
So instead of feeling down about a hero who lost their cape, let's relive The Freeze's greatest moments ... so far.

MONTREAL - Six people have been arrested amid a rash of cyber-attacks launched by the activist group Anonymous against Quebec government websites.
The arrests were made in different Quebec cities in an operation that involved five police forces — the RCMP, the Surete du Quebec, and three municipal forces.
Those arrested faced a variety of charges Tuesday, including mischief, conspiracy, and unlawful use of a computer. Three of them were minors. The arrests took place in Rimouski, Sherbrooke, Forestville, Montreal and Longueuil, Que.
Police offered no other clues about the case, other than to say the attacks were on "public" and "parapublic" websites. They said they did not want to jeopardize their ongoing case by sharing details, such as whether those arrested operated under the "Anonymous" name.
Cyber-activists have, under the group name "Anonymous," mounted numerous campaigns in different countries and on occasion defaced websites of organizations they oppose. A recent target has been the Quebec government because of its anti-protest law.
Self-described Anonymous activists have recently hacked into a variety of websites linked to the Quebec government — including the province's education and public-safety departments, as well as that of the provincial Liberal party.
But police Tuesday did not specifically link the arrests to Anonymous. They also did not specify what websites those arrested were accused of attacking.
"Police authorities want to indicate that they take this kind of crime very seriously," the police said in a statement. "They will use every means at their disposition to find the authors. These people expose themselves to criminal charges, regardless of whatever intention prompted their action."
Last month, hackers managed to disable more than a dozen websites, including the sites of the Education Department, the Quebec Liberal party and the Montreal police force.
The circle then appeared to broaden. In addition to Formula One car-race spectators having their information published online, footage was released from an exclusive birthday party held for a member of the powerful Desmarais family.
People claiming to operate under the name "Anonymous" sent an ominously worded email to more than 100 people who bought tickets to the Formula One Grand Prix weekend in Montreal.
"If you intend to use a car, know that your road may be barricaded," said a document described as a ‘Notice to Grand Prix Visitors.'
"If you want to stay in a hotel, know that we may enter it. If you seek to withdraw money from a bank, know that the shattering glass may sting. If you plan on watching a race, know that your view may be obscured, not by exhaust fumes but by the smoke of the fires we set. Know that the evacuation order may not come fast enough."
There were protests at a number of sites related to the June 7-10 Grand Prix, and attempts to paralyze some of them, but police acted pre-emptively. Over that weekend, they either created barriers blocking access to certain public places, or detained people suspected of planning to disrupt events.
The police reaction brought a counter-reaction from protesters and their supporters: that law enforcement violated fundamental freedoms, such as the right to free mobility and expression, by making arbitrary detentions in what amounted to "political profiling."

By now it should be abundantly clear to the Trump administration that there are Obama administration holdovers in the 1.3 million non-defense, civilian federal workforce who have no other intention than to politically damage the White House.
These rogue bureaucrats are not serving the American people, they are serving a political agenda, and frankly, they need not be tolerated.
The whole reason the District of Columbia was created without voting rights or representation was so that those who work for the federal government would not wield political power. They are supposed to be neutral. Working for the government is a privilege, not a right, and it's time that President Donald Trump remind them by removing Obama administration hires, particularly if there is no other way to root out subversive employees.
Part of the problem is former President Barack Obama changed civil service rules to make it easier to hire federal employees. Trump has solved that by initiating their hiring freeze. But federal rules also make it extremely difficult to fire civil servants. It is a process that can take up to two years, even when there is cause. That said, problem employees who, say, don't show up for work should be dealt with through this process immediately.
But to do more requires Congress to step in, which can assist this process three-fold: 1) By incentivizing early retirement via the appropriations process with limited-time-only buy-outs; 2) cutting the personnel budgets of non-defense civilian departments and agencies, reducing the enacted full-time equivalent number for each department, agency and office by 10 to 20 percent in the workforce on a last-one-in, first-one-out basis; and 3) defunding existing preferences under federal rules being given to those laid off being later rehired on a first-in-line basis. That would eliminate politicized Obama administration holdovers, and prevent them from being rehired should it become necessary to fill in some gaps.
Other ideas include eliminating automatic dues deduction for federal employees unions and getting rid of any full-time official time union personnel.
Taken together, a comprehensive civil service reform can only possibly be accomplished in the context of the upcoming continuing resolution and budget process, by simply not appropriating monies for the same number of full-time equivalent employees as last year, and defunding preferences for rehiring previously laid off personnel.
Not only can't Trump do it alone, Congress should step up to the plate exercising their Article I powers and rein in this rogue administrative state.

Broadcaster Lowell "Bud" Paxson yesterday contradicted statements from Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign that the senator did not meet with Paxson or their lobbyist before sending two controversial letters to the Federal Communications Commission on Paxson's behalf.
Paxson said they talked with McCain in their Washington office several weeks before the Arizona Republican wrote the letters in 1999 to the FCC urging a rapid decision on Paxson's quest to acquire a Pittsburgh television station.
Paxson also recalled that their lobbyist, Vicki Iseman, likely attended the meeting in McCain's office and that Iseman helped arrange the meeting. "Was Vicki there? Probably," Paxson said in an interview with The Washington Post yesterday. "The woman was a professional. They were good. They could get us meetings."
The recollection of the now-retired Paxson conflicted with the account provided by the McCain campaign about the two letters at the center of a controversy about the senator's ties to Iseman, a partner at the lobbying firm of Alcalde & Fay.
The McCain campaign said Thursday that the senator had not met with Paxson or Iseman on the matter. "No representative of Paxson or Alcalde and Fay personally asked Senator McCain to send a letter to the FCC regarding this proceeding," the campaign said in a statement.
But Paxson said yesterday, "I remember going there to meet with him." They recalled that they told McCain: "You're head of the Commerce Committee. The FCC is not doing its job. I would love for you to write a letter."
McCain attorney Robert S. Bennett played down the contradiction between the campaign's written answer and Paxson's recollection.
"We understood that they [McCain] did not speak directly with them [Paxson]. Now it appears they did speak to him. What is the difference?" Bennett said. "McCain has never denied that Paxson asked for assistance from their office. It doesn't seem relevant whether the request got to them through Paxson or the staff. Their letters to the FCC concerning the matter urged the commission to make up its mind. They did not ask the FCC to approve or deny the application. It's not that big a deal."
The Paxson deal, coming as McCain made their first run for the presidency, has posed a persistent problem for the senator. The deal raised embarrassing questions about their dealings with lobbyists at a time when they had assumed the role of an ethics champion and opponent of the influence of lobbyists.
The two letters they wrote to the FCC in 1999 while they were chairperson of the Senate Commerce Committee produced a rash of criticism and a written rebuke from the then-FCC chairperson, who called McCain's intervention "highly unusual." McCain had repeatedly used Paxson's corporate jet for their campaign and accepted campaign contributions from the broadcaster and their law firm.
McCain themselves in a deposition in 2002 acknowledged talking to Paxson about the Pittsburgh sale. Asked what Paxson said in the conversation, McCain said that Paxson "had applied to purchase this station and that they wanted to purchase it. And that there had been a numerous year delay with the FCC reaching a decision. And they wanted their approval very bad for purposes of their business."
The deposition was taken in litigation over the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law filed by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). The contradiction in the deposition was first reported by Newsweek yesterday afternoon.
What is the PSA test?
Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by normal, as well as malignant, cells of the prostate gland. The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood.
The blood level of PSA is often elevated in men with prostate cancer, and the PSA test was originally approved by the FDA in 1986 to monitor the progression of prostate cancer in men who had already been diagnosed with the disease. In 1994, the FDA approved the use of the PSA test in conjunction with a digital rectal exam (DRE) to test asymptomatic men for prostate cancer. Men who report prostate symptoms often undergo PSA testing (along with a DRE) to help doctors determine the nature of the problem.
In addition to prostate cancer, a number of benign (not cancerous) conditions can cause a man's PSA level to rise. The most frequent benign prostate conditions that cause an elevation in PSA level are prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (enlargement of the prostate). There is no evidence that prostatitis or BPH leads to prostate cancer, but it is possible for a man to have one or both of these conditions and to develop prostate cancer as well.
In December 2009, the Chevron Legacy, a new and now the only marine fuel station for Vancouver Harbour, was completed by the builders, Alaska Ship & Drydock, Inc. of Ketchikan, Alaska. The station was then towed to Vancouver and was installed and made operational in late January, 2010, then only to be overshadowed by the nearby barge bearing the Olympic rings seen on all our TV screens!
This station replaced the venerable Chevron barge S.O.B.C. No. 5 which has been moored in Coal Harbour since it was built in 1959. Both the original fuel barge and the modern replacement were designed by Robert Allan Ltd., Naval Architects of Vancouver, B.C. The project leaders at Robert Allan Ltd. for this vessel were Bart Stockdill, P. Eng., Project Manager, and Allan Turner, P. Eng., Project Engineer.
The Chevron Legacy has many unique features reflecting its critical role serving the marine community of the lower BC coast. The most critical feature is the fact that this is now a complete double-hulled structure to mitigate any risk of oil pollution from inadvertent hull damage. In addition, the decks are designed to capture rain water and any oil contamination for onboard processing and then disposal ashore. Rainwater landing on the roof is directed overboard through large diameter scuppers without landing on the decks.
The station has the following storage capacities:
Marine Diesel
Gasoline
Lube Oils – 1,284,000 litres
– 160,500 litres
– 79,100 litres in bulk tanks
– 8,000 litres in drums
The maximum fuel discharge rate is 50,000 litres per hour.
Overall dimensions of the Chevron Legacy are 35.40 metres long x 18.00 metres wide by 4.50 metres depth. The operating draft will vary according to load, between 1.5 metres and 3.5 metres. A lower level float for servicing small craft is connected to the west end of the station.
The layout of the barge features a modern sales office and store with comfortable crew lounge and rest area at one end, connected by a covered bridgeway to the bulk stores and service area at the other end. Below decks all tanks and pumps are readily accessible for service and maintenance via a central pipe corridor.

It's the most fully realized world of any Wes Anderson film, and just like Avatar, the story is a travel guide through the world as much as the world is a gateway for the story. Each meticulously planned out frame is filled with impeccable set design, a Kubrickian eye to detail, and astounding in-shot choreography that even the laziest viewer couldn't miss. For example, a character enters the frame, performs a complex action, leaves the frame, then the camera will quick-pan (suddenly change directions without cutting) and further actions are performed with acute precision. The effect is one of overwhelming realism. This is ironic, because Grand Budapest takes place in a fictitious Eastern European nation called The Republic of Zubrowka. There are constant allusions to history throughout, from fascism to communism, making the setting and events of the film instantly recognizable for audiences. Sometimes this is for comedic effect, but far more often it's for a much more serious goal. The film's setting, with all its rampant political symbolism, lets Wes tell a story they couldn't have if they grounded the movie in reality. Satirizing real-life Nazis hasn't been in vogue since Indiana Jones, no matter how hard Guillermo Del Toro tried to resurrect that trope with Hellboy. Instead, its authenticity is of a kind totally unique to Wes Anderson himself. This is similar to many of their films, like the imaginary New York in Royal Tenenbaums, only intensified tenfold.
There's a high-intensity chase sequence late in the film that might make their fans do a double take. Or they would if it wasn't executed almost entirely in stop motion photography like The Nightmare Before Christmas or Coraline. Many of the scenes that take place outside are actually captured with the stop motion method, certainly a trick they perfected from Fantastic Mr. Fox. These sequences should seem artificial and contrived, pretentious even, but they aren't treated as anything other than what they are: a natural part of their made up whimsical world.
Beneath the rich aesthetics is their most fully developed setting and story, with many interconnected moving parts that may be difficult to fully digest on a first viewing. Really, the film has as many as five plot-arcs running at the same time, collapsing and expanding on each other with the same fluidity as Chris Nolan's Inception. It's complex without ever feeling like you missed the essential details, it's just that you'd want to return more than once to absorb them all. There are stories within stories, not to mention the moving parts in each layer of the narrative. If you'll notice, this is a recurring theme in Wes Anderson's films except, maybe, their last. Rushmore opens and ends with a theater curtain, and you begin to wonder if Rushmore the film is just another one of Max Fischer's plays. The Royal Tenenbaums is a book read to the audience, and The Darjeeling Limited has a character who, against their best intentions to write fiction, ignorantly and accidentally writes about their life instead. In Grand Budapest, some of those things are repeated, and just as the setting of Zubrowka exaggerates Wes' habit of making alternative worlds for their stories, the story-within-a-story element is exaggerated as well.
• ‘If you look at fanbase and support, reality is we probably are bigger club' • ‘Our dark days definitely behind us,' says manager of 2008 FA Cup winners
Paul Cook's praise of Bournemouth is nothing short of effusive and, while the Portsmouth manager admitted they are attempting to emulate the rise of Eddie Howe's squad from the doldrums to the Premier League, Cook believes in many aspects their team remain a bigger club.
Colchester's Darren Ambrose: ‘I'm good enough to get back where I want to be' Read more
The 2008 FA Cup winners play host to Bournemouth in the fourth round on Saturday with Pompey's opponents now operating several levels above their south-coast neighbours despite meeting in League One only three years ago. Fifty-seven places separate them and the achievements of the traditionally smaller club is an inspiration.
“I think if you look at our fanbase and support the reality is we probably are bigger,” Cook said. “If you look at history, the likelihood is that we probably are. But if you look at where we sit today, we are definitely not. There is an argument for both sides.
“You have to take your hats off to not just Eddie but the people who took them from a dark place to where they are now. When you drop an anchor and can't go lower or get worse, for the majority of clubs the future is bright.”
That is certainly the case at Portsmouth. They presently reside in the League Two play-off places, seven points off an automatic promotion spot but with games in hand. The team are settled and recently strengthened while off the field they are back on a solid footing. “Our dark days are definitely behind us,” they added.
“Our support has not wavered in any shape or form. Without getting into the past too much, we are on a forward curve now. How quickly we go forward remains to be seen.” As for Howe's example, Cook said: “I'm struggling to get out of League Two at the moment, I'm not even thinking about following him.”
But it is easy to draw parallels between the two managers. Both are wedded to similar playing philosophies and refuse to divert from them no matter the calibre of opposition. Cook has some decisions to make over their starting XI but promises whoever gets the call to play will stick to the side's attacking principles. It could make for a thrilling spectacle.

“We have the exact same belief in terms of playing style here,” they said. “Bournemouth will find we won't park the bus. We didn't at Ipswich [in the previous round], and we have very similar beliefs in how the game should be played. If you get beat, you move on and that's one of things that stands out for me about them – how they manage disappointment. They never wallow in it, they move on.”
Fratton Park will be sold out for the third time in 11 days, following the third-round replay win against Ipswich Town and last Saturday's 1-0 League Two defeat to Oxford United. For Cook this is a testament to the club's unwavering supporters.
“It's great credit to the people of Portsmouth that the last three games have been sold out coming to the end of January when money is tight,” said the 48-year-old. “The ticket office has had people turning up every day.”
Naturally there has been plenty of big-game excitement around the city this week, but Cook conceded one eye is already trained on Tuesday's long trip to Morecambe.
“The likelihood is the Bournemouth game will take care of itself but the Morecambe game will be a lot more difficult fixture in terms of the mental side of the game,” they said.
“If we can give a good account of ourselves and get our fans off their seats we'll go home happy.”
The decade of 50s was characterized by romanticisation of communism in India. Such was the romance that many leaders of the post-Independence dispensation, most of who claimed to have made huge sacrifices for India's Independence, hailed the Communist takeover of China. It may be underscored that India was the first non-communist country to accord diplomatic recognition in January 1950 to China consequent to the establishment of Mao's rule.
Amongst the exceptions, who did not romanticize and saw the writing on the wall very clearly, was Sardar Patel. In their letter dated 7 November 1950 to Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel wrote: "...outside the Russian Camp, we have practically been alone in championing the cause of Chinese entry into the UNO... it (China) continues to regard us with suspicion and the whole psychology is one, at least outwardly of skepticism perhaps mixed with little hostility... it looks as though it is not a friend speaking in that language but a potential enemy..."
My son doesn't say prayers before bed. He's never been to church or Sunday school. We haven't talked to them about God yet and we've never read to them from the Bible. They haven't been baptized. So far, they seem no more devilish than your average 4-year-old boy, so I'm optimistic that our secular home isn't turning them into a serial killer.
It's impossible to be entirely certain about these things, but I've got my fingers crossed.
My husband and I never sat down and said, "We will not be a religious family." My husband was raised in a religiously observant, Catholic home, but despite years as an altar boy and a rigorous Jesuit education, they haven't gone to church in years.  They are a spiritual man, but I wouldn't describe them as religious. I'm from the less devout Protestant side of the fence, but not even four years of religious studies in college returned me to the fold. When we met and married, we never discussed including religion in our life together.
Our only prayers are of the "Oh, please let them sleep for just five more minutes" kind.
Yet, every so often I wonder if we're denying our son something important. Should they be exposed to the kind of community that some religious traditions offer? Is it ok to leave them to figure it all out when he's an adult? Will they be less of a person or miss out on important connections to their life and the world if I don't guide them down a spiritual path? Will they end up a delinquent Scrooge visited by the ghosts of secular holidays past? To be a good parent do I have to help them explore options at the theological buffet so they can choose what appeals to him?
Am I going to hell for even talking about this?
I've tended to avoid opportunities to discuss religion with my boy. When they brought home their edible menorah from school (a study in matzo, Skittles and pretzels), I only briefly mentioned its connection to Hanukkah. (Given that their only question was if they could eat it before dinner, it wasn't hard to avoid a deeper discussion.) Easter has been a time for chocolate bunnies and a celebration of spring. Christmas in my world is about the food, time with family, carols and general good cheer. This is what I emphasize with my son, so that's really all they know.
I even dodged religion when my parents' cat, DJ, died last year. Because this was my son's first experience with death, I knew it should be handled with some care.
I told them the cat was dead.
I explained that things die when their bodies get old and sick and too tired to work anymore. I even pulled out the trusty "circle of life" imagery. There are no cats with angel wings in my world.
My dad, not sharing my cold-hard-truth approach to Important Life Lessons, told my son that DJ went to heaven. My son liked this idea, charmed I'm sure by the notion of DJ pouncing on unsuspecting angelic mice and playing poker with other cats. (My husband, a devoted dog guy, finds the possibility of a feline afterlife horrifying. He's convinced that cat heaven would smell like pee and involve a lot of scheming.)
So, up until now, DJ's fate has been the extent of my son's religious curiosity. Which isn't all that surprising, given that he's still in preschool. They probably won't always be so disinterested and I expect that there will be a time they may ask more questions. It makes sense for me to have a plan of attack before that happens.
After a lifetime being blasé about all things religious, my matzo-eating son has made me re-evaluate my choice to live outside of rituals of faith.
This is a challenge for me. I'm not convinced that any of the world's religions have the perfect template for leading a good life or raising moral children. There is a lot about formalized religion that I find troubling. For any number of reasons, I've always been more comfortable with the idea of spirituality as opposed to "religion."
Yet, I want my son to learn the importance of social justice, charity and equality. To do that, I think it's important that they be exposed to a community of people who believe in fairness, service, generosity, and taking care of others. My husband and I spend time talking with them about these things.
And, again, the kid is only four.
Right now, morality is usually served up to my son as "sharing is caring" -- which often translates into reminders to share their toys and to leave some Cheerios for their friends.
But I see signs that he's starting to see the bigger picture. The students in their preschool class are currently collecting "Change for Chicks" to buy a flock of chickens through Heifer International. My son makes sure they have some coins every morning to put in the collection jar. I love this about him.
My husband and I want our son to grow into a compassionate, loving and principled man. We want them to learn humility and gratitude. We know he'll be better off if they are surrounded by people who share similar values, who love them for who they are and support them through whatever challenges come their way. Our family and friends will do that. But, do we also need a church, temple, or meeting house to make sure the lessons we teach them stick? If so, should we forgo our unscheduled Sundays for sermons?
I'm not sure.
Religion can be a positive presence in some people's lives -- increasing their optimism, happiness and even academic achievement. Religious traditions can provide comfort during times of loss and an extended family for those who need it, and people who regularly attend church gain emotional support from the friendships they form there. All of those things are good things for kids (and adults).
Still, I don't know that regular church attendance or even religion itself is necessary to raise "good" kids. I'm not even sure that a belief in God is required to lead a fully-realized or examined life. Even if it is, I don't know how to join a church in good conscience when I disagree with central tenets of its faith.
Unless and until my son starts asking about God or showing a renewed interest in heaven, I'm content sticking with non-church going ways. I also know that this decision isn't entirely up to me. How we talk with our son about religion, spirituality and how to live a good life is going to be something my husband and I talk about for years to come.
The first half of the Giants season was littered with offensive inconsistency. There were games they looked great (Washington) and others they looked incompetent (Detroit).
It's why the Giants are 18th in total offense, 16th in rushing offense and 17th in passing offense. It's a middle-of-the-road unit.
This was somewhat expected in a new offense under a first-time offensive coordinator in Ben McAdoo. The Giants (3-5) weren't supposed to have smooth sailing, especially with quarterback Eli Manning playing in a different offensive system for the first time in a decade.
But maybe we all though about this wrong. Manning is fine. They earned a solid grade for their first-half performance. Maybe it was everyone else we should have been worrying about as the Giants looked to get comfortable in their new offense. The grades reflect that. Manning had the second highest grade of any offensive starter.

CLOSE An elephant tranquilizer has been linked to 19 deaths in Michigan USA TODAY

DETROIT — Officials say it is 10,000 times more potent than morphine and 100 times more potent than fentanyl.
Carfentanil — an animal tranquilizer being mixed with heroin and other street drugs — has been linked to at least 19 deaths in Wayne County since July, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Carfentanil was also suspected but not confirmed in a Kent County case last month.
The confirmation Thursday from the state and Wayne County puts residents and health care providers on alert of the deadly danger the drug poses — a drug that officials say has no antidote.
"The Wayne County Medical Examiner reported 19 deaths associated with carfentanil, and in all cases where it was present, it was combined with other opioids including heroin, U47700 or other designer opioids," according to a news release Thursday.
The health department said there also has been an increase in severe opioid-related toxicity in southeastern and central Michigan reported to Michigan Regional Poison Control Center at Children's Hospital of Michigan over the past week. It said many of the patients "fit the clinical picture expected with carfentanil but because there is no currently validated testing, these cannot be confirmed."
Eden Wells, chief medical executive for the state health department, said the laboratory that does toxicology testing is doing further analysis on samples from surrounding counties.
Carfentanil has been linked to multiple overdose deaths in neighboring Ohio, according to the news release.
"This is really scary. We know there have been some instances in Port Huron and New Haven where this has been suspected," said Judge Linda B. Davis, who is president of Families Against Narcotics and chairperson of Gov. Rick Snyder's commission on opiate prevention. "It makes it more deadly than heroin already is. ... It is devastating communities."
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, carfentanil is "an extremely potent fentanyl analog" that was designed in 1974 and previously used exclusively for veterinary use with large animals, such as elephants. It is not approved for use in humans and has been shown to be 100 times more potent than fentanyl — which itself is a highly potent narcotic — in animal studies, according to the CDC.
According to the state health department, carfentanil mixed with heroin, and sometimes sold in pill form, puts residents at great risk of accidental overdose and death due to the extreme potency of the drug. Its effects occur within minutes of exposure — disorientation, coughing, sedation, respiratory distress or cardiac arrest and death.
“The street drug supply is probably more dangerous than usual because of carfentanil,” said Carl Schmidt, Wayne County chief medical examiner. “There are other derivatives of opiates that may be present as well, and may be more potent than fentanyl already is. As always, purchasing street drugs comes with a risk — you may get something other than what you think you bought.”
Lloyd Jackson, spokesperson for the Wayne County medical examiner's office, agreed.
"This stuff is so deadly, you could die before you can get high," they said.
In August, the National Institute on Drug Abuse posted carfentanil warnings by authorities in Ohio and Florida, saying it has been linked to a significant number of overdose deaths nationwide.
On Sept. 22, the Drug Enforcement Administration issued a public health warning to the public and law enforcement — who may come into contact with it — about the health and safety risks of carfentanil. DEA acting administrator Chuck Rosenberg called carfentanil "crazy dangerous."
In response to the state's prescription drug and opioid abuse epidemic, Snyder announced that Michiganders can seek medical help for themselves or others without fear of prosecution in case of a potential drug overdose under legislation they signed Thursday.

Amid rumours first broken by Eliotte Friedman of CBC, Tim Leiweke has officially announced through memo that they will be stepping down as chief executive of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors and Toronto F.C.
Leiweke, former CEO of the Anschutz Entertainment Group, became President and CEO of MLSE on June 30, 2013. The hope was that Leiweke could bring the winning success they found in AEG, who own the Los Angeles Kings, Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Galaxy. They came into the position after Rogers Communications and Bell Canada took a majority 75% share in MLSE.
Leiweke was considered a positive influence on the Toronto F.C. and Toronto Raptors, as their fortunes soon changed under Leiweke's supervision. Maple Leaf fans felt originally ignored by Leiweke and were unhappy with some of their comments on planning a parade route and removing much of the history in the Air Canada Centre of the Maple Leafs. Despite missing the playoffs, the Toronto Maple Leafs have recently been moving in the right direction department wise with their recent statistics hirings and the hiring of Brendan Shanahan.
According to the release, Leiweke will stay on board until June 30, 2015 or until a successor is named. They were reported to have a five year deal with MLSE. There were rumours they were unhappy living in Toronto.
We will have more information if the story develops.

Arctic non-warming since 1938
The Catlin Arctic Survey arrived at the North Pole this week.
Described as three of ‘the world's toughest' explorers, Ann Daniels, Charlie Paton and Martin Hartley reached the Geographic North Pole at on 12th May, ending a grueling 60-day trek across the floating sea ice of the Arctic Ocean…They made it with only hours to spare before a Twin Otter plane was scheduled to land on the ice to collect them.
Congratulations to them on completing a difficult journey against the Beaufort Gyre. They can now compare their Oceanic pH data vs. the non-existent database from past years, and predictably conclude that pH might be lower than it used to be – due to CO2.
Figure 1: Beaufort Gyre
The spring melt season continues to eat away at the periphery of the ice pack. The animation below (made from Cryosphere Today images) shows the changes since the first of the month.
Figure 2
As you can see, not much has changed during the last two weeks. The image below, made from NSIDC images, shows areas of anomalously high extent in green, and anomalously low extent in red.
Figure 3
As in past weeks there is excess ice in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, and a deficiency in the Barents Sea – which are all always ice free during the summer anyway.
To keep the death spiral in perspective, the image below (made from Cryosphere Today images) compares mid-September 30% concentration ice from the years 2009 and 1990. Red shows areas of ice loss since 1990 and green shows areas of ice gain. I'm guessing that the Arctic will probably not be ice free by 2013, as predicted by researchers at the Naval Post-Graduate School.
Figure 4
The image below shows mid-September ice gain from 2007-2009 in green, and loss in red.
Figure 5
There continues to be a significant divergence in the extent graphs. Norsex in red is close to the 30 year mean, while NSIDC (blue) DMI (stippled) and JAXA (green) are closer to two standard deviations from the mean. The deficiency is almost entirely located in the Barents Sea, as seen above in Figure 3.
Figure 6
The modified NSIDC image below shows ice loss since early April in red.
Figure 7
The modified NSIDC image below compares April 14 2007 and 2010 ice. Areas in green have gained ice since 2007, and areas in red have lost ice since 2007.
Figure 8
It is still too early in the year to see much interesting. Still about six weeks before significant melting begins in the interior of the Arctic. Stay tuned.

Trout are making a comeback at a brook in a business park near Halifax thanks to a storm drain system introduced by a biologist and a boutique planning firm.
Grassy Brook — tucked between wide roads, a sea of parking lots and big box stores in Dartmouth Crossing — runs several kilometres through the eastern edge of Burnside Industrial Park, down through Dartmouth Crossing and drains into Lake Micmac.
In 2005, the developers behind Dartmouth Crossing hired biologist Bob Rutherford and Environmental Design and Management Limited to realign part of the waterway and develop a storm drain system that would help bring trout back to the brook.
"The developers wanted this as the signature part of Dartmouth Crossing, and keep the stream and fix it up," said Rutherford.
"But all the literature will tell you that you can't do a trout stream in something that's 90 per cent paved and hard-roofed and solid."
Trout comeback

Yet, turning Grassy Brook into a healthy trout spawning stream is exactly what Rutherford and EDM Ltd. have accomplished.
"Today, there's about 110 trout per 100 square metres in the brook," Rutherford said. "The environmental assessment in 2005 said there were maybe one or two trout per 100 square metres, so that's quite an increase.
"We would normally expect in a stream like this to have maybe 20 or 30 trout per 100 square metres."

Rutherford says the trout levels in Grassy Brook compare favourably to the best rehabilitated natural trout streams in the province, which flow into the Northumberland Strait. Those streams have about 150 trout per 100 square metres, and gravel beds where water seeps in to allow the trout to spawn.
"There's nothing in this brook that a trout can move to dig away and bury their eggs in the bottom for the winter," they said.
"But what they're doing is they're getting down in between all this cobble and small boulder and just letting their eggs stay down in there. It's working really well for them — not a traditional trout habitat."
Storm water management key

Rutherford says stormwater drain controls and the rebuilding of the brook bed west of Finlay Drive were instrumental in making the waterway healthy.
EDM Ltd. worked with Rutherford to build a berm near Finlay Drive and create an artificial marsh to slow the flow of water downstream and help it cool.

Large sections of the upper part of Grassy Brook used to disappear below ground alongside the site of a former quarry.
EDM Ltd. and Rutherford worked to rebuild the brook there and bring it all to the surface, further helping trout life.
They also convinced the developer to build wide road culverts that wouldn't interfere with the path of the stream. Provincial regulations only require that culverts be 1.2 metres in diameter to accommodate existing streams, but the ones along Grassy Brook are 12 to 15 metres wide.
"It's seamless, they've been kept out of the stream's path," Rutherford said.
Further downstream, several "storm jails" — fenced-in, rock-lined holes where stormwater from nearby streets and parking lots pools, cools down and trickles out slowly — also help prevent any sudden surges in water levels that would affect trout life.

Man-made springs, cool water — and vigilance
Still further along in Grassy Brook Park, about 75 human-made springs pipe water in slowly from surrounding buildings and parking lots. That water helps feed a large human-made gravel spawning pool.
"The nice thing is that all the water coming in here is about nine or 10 degrees. It stays nice and warm for the trout all winter so they actually hatch earlier in this pond than they do in the stream because it's colder.
"Because we've got all the water going into the ground in this watershed the way it should in a forested situation, the stream never gets hotter than 16 or 17 degrees in the summer time. Trout like that."
The Clean Foundation is also helping with efforts to clean up wayward garbage blown in from the surrounding parking lots. (Zak Markan/CBC)
Rutherford is also working with the developer to build a few more pedestrian bridges across the Brook — wooden bridges, to allow for a continuous path from Grassy Brook Park along the brook all the way to the end of the human-made marsh north-west of Finlay Drive. There's one pedestrian bridge already near the park.
Groups such as the Sackville Rivers Association and the Adopt-a-Stream Program have helped with managing the brook rehabilitation. The Clean Foundation is also helping with efforts to clean up wayward garbage blown in from the surrounding parking lots.
Rutherford says Grassy Brook is a great success, but they need to remain vigilant about what sort of stormwater systems developers in the upper part of the watershed plan on building.
We are not exactly enthousiastic about states and nations. Not about new states and not about old states. In less than 24 hours there will be a public and binding referendum on Catalan independence from the Spanish state. We won't jump on the nationalist bandwagon but we do see the ugly Francoist and fascist face of the Spanish state. After the massive wave of repression, which is ongoing, It's not just about nationalism anymore.

We are not exactly enthousiastic about states and nations. Not about new states and not about old states. In less than 24 hours there will be a public and binding referendum on Catalan independence from the Spanish state. We won't jump on the nationalist bandwagon but we do see the ugly Francoist and fascist face of the Spanish state. After the massive wave of repression, which is ongoing, It's not just about nationalism anymore.
Tomás Ibañez, the anarchist, was right when they wrote (in a letter to Miquel Amorós on September 26): “What has happened to some of the most combative sectors of Catalan society that have gone from ‘surrounding the Parlament' in the summer of 2011 to want to defend the Institutions of Catalonia in September 2017?”
That many people are now celebrating the Catalan police (Mossos) is terrifying. It was the Mossos d'escuadra that cleared the Plaza Catalunya with an orgy of violence during the 15M occupation of the square in Barcelona in 2011.
15M was the first movement which was able to mobilize large parts of Spanish society which questioned the political architecture of the “Regime of '78”, named after the constitution of 1978. The so-called “transition” from the fascist Franco regime into a parlamentary democracy, left the Francoist political and military class untouched and actually was just a reform of the Franco regime. On October 9, 1976 former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga founded the People's Alliance (Alianza Popular, AP). Fraga authorized the execution of political prisoners under the Franco regime. A notable case is the execution of communist leader Julián Grimau, whom they called “that little gentleman” (Spanish: ese caballerete) in a press conference when asked about their detention and death sentence. Fraga was also one of the writers of the new Spanish constitution which was approved in 1978 and was never charged for the crimes they committed during the Franco years.
The now governing Partido Popular (PP) of prime-minster Mariano Rajoy was a re-foundation (in 1989) of the People's Alliance (Alianza Popular, AP), again founded by Manuel Fraga. The 15M mobilizations made the political establishment increasingly nervous. Demonstrations were surpressed with police violence and the political class also reacted with new repressive and authoritarian laws like the “Ley Mordaza” (Gag law). With this law the cops are the ones who can charge and punish people for civil disobedience, without any form of interference or verdict by the courts.
A lot has happened since the massive 15M mobilisations across Spain in 2011 and 2012. In May 2017 we republished a piece by Autonomies about 15M in which Tomás Ibáñez stated that the “worst that could have happened to 15M, and the future of social struggle, would have been for it to have allowed itself to be led by the libertarian movement … or that it have assumed as its own the principles and objectives of the the libertarian movement.” (Ibáñez, Anarquismos a contratiempo, 269) The “worst” thing, they qualify, excluding 15M ending up in the hands of some left-wing, extreme left-wing or nationalist political parties. The rise of Podemos would seem to confirm the worst. The Spanish streets were empty again.
But not in Catalonia. The independence movement was already growing but the end of the massive 15M mobilizations and the rejection by the Spanish Constitutional Court, at the request of Rahoy's Partido Popular, of a draft Regional Statute approved by the Catalan courts, was also the start of an enormous boost for the struggle for independence. The regional Catalonian political class became under pressure after social movements and large parts of society demanded the right to decide about the independence of Catalonia. As a result many politicians started to support the project of an independent state.
After the Catalan government announced to hold a referendum for independence on the first of October, the Spanish state reacted with a wave of repression. Regional government buildings were raided, ballot boxes confiscated and thousands of riot cops and paramilitary Guardia Civil squads were sent to Catalonia by the central government. The .cat domain registration office was raided, websites and google apps banned just to name a few of the measures taken by Rajoy's central government in Madrid. Rajoy again and again stated that the referendum about the independence of Catalonia will not take place.
Given the wave of repression by the Spanish state many anarchist comrades in Catalonia will support the struggle against repression and for the right of self-determination and freedom of information. Many of them will do so although they are not supporting the idea of another state.
We don't believe in new states, especially not within a capitalist framework. We are convinced that we need an anti-capitalistic social transformation where production, consumption and decision-making are self-organized and in the hands of the people, a social transformation without states and borders. But we also can't look away when the Spanish state is showing its ugly fascist Francoist face and repress people. We can't look away when basic rights like the freedom of information and the right to determine peoples political will is being attacked by the authoritarian government in Madrid.
The opinions of anarchist comrades in Catalonia are mixed. While some people think that Catalonian independence is an opportunity to boost the struggle for social and emancipatory issues in a new and possibly unstable state (at least in the beginning), others think that the struggle for independence is distracting from these struggles. There should be no doubt about the objectives of the neoliberal ruling class in Catalonia. As soon as they do not need the social movements anymore, they will be the first to repress the emancipatory forces in the movement. We are not very optimistic but will support the struggle against repression and for social transformation as good as we can. In Catalonia and elswhere.

A woman has told how they lost their typical American accent and now speaks with a SCOTTISH twang after developing a rare medical condition.
Linda Pereira, 50, from Atlanta, Georgia, has only ever travelled abroad twice but is regularly mistaken for being from the UK.
The mother-of-three, originally from San Jose, California, was diagnosed with ultra rare Foreign Accent Syndrome after feeling an eruption in their brain while messaging a friend on Facebook in October last year.
They have also been mistaken as being from Sweden, Germany and South Africa.
(Image: PA)
Linda, who has documented the changes on their YouTube channel, said they were pleased about their new accents.
Describing the moment they lost their Californian drawl, they said: "My family went out and I was on Facebook talking to a friend.
"It was a rather complex topic, and in trying to reply, I felt extremely tired and could barely keep my eyes open.
"I decided to lie down, but this didn't help, and I felt a weird pressure in my brain I hadn't felt before.
"It was a ball, and as I typed, my eyes and brain seemed to fuzz in and out.
"I thought it was a result of trying to think too hard, so I went over to something funny on Facebook with one of my friends and I started to type a reply, when I felt a ball erupt and an electrical eruption moved throughout my entire brain.
"I couldn't move and couldn't open my mouth."
(Image: PA)
The former computer repairer was alone until their computer engineer husband Phil, 55, returned home two-and-a-half-hours later.
Paralysed, they could only blink frantically to get their attention and communicate that something was terribly wrong.
"All I was thinking is 'What am I going to do?," the grandmother-of-two said.
"When my husband came home, they thought I was just having a rest and it took them half-an-hour to finally realise I couldn't answer him."
After about an hour of being unable to open their mouth, Linda was finally able to take some medication to calm them down.
(Image: PA)
Later that night, they recorded their voice to hear how they sounded so they could work out what had happened - but it was not until the next day they noticed the strange change.
"My husband thought I sounded British and said sometimes they couldn't understand me, but I thought it was more Swedish or German," they said.
Two days later, their physiologist and neurologist diagnosed them with Foreign Accent Syndrome, which affects just 60 people worldwide.
Now, their voice interchanges between the Scandinavian sounds, German and sometimes switches to a Scottish or South African-twang.
(Image: PA)
Linda says their family cannot believe how differently they speak - and even gets better service in restaurants and shops because staff think they are a tourist.
They entertain their family with impersonations from the Disney film Frozen and confuses their mother-in-law who asks them to stop doing the "silly accent."
But Linda says they do miss their Californian tones.
"At first we all thought it was funny," they said. "We had a good time with it but I was always thinking it was temporary and going to go away.
(Image: PA)
"Now, this is how I know myself and I know it doesn't sound like me."
The syndrome usually results from a stroke, but can also develop from head trauma, migraines or developmental problems.
It is unclear what exactly caused Linda's condition.
They have suffered slight changes in their speech since 2000, thought to be due to a contraceptive pill.
They were also diagnosed Tardive Akathisia and Functional Neurological Disorder in June last year which means they suffer with non-epileptic seizures and unclear speech.

"War chant" redirects here. For the stallion with the same name, see War Chant . For other uses, see war song
"War cry" redirects here. For other uses, see Warcry (disambiguation)
A battle cry is a yell or chant taken up in battle, usually by members of the same combatant group. Battle cries are not necessarily articulate (e.g. "Eliaaaa!", "Alala"..), although they often aim to invoke patriotic or religious sentiment. Their purpose is a combination of arousing aggression and esprit de corps on one's own side and causing intimidation on the hostile side. Battle cries are a universal form of display behaviour (i.e., threat display) aiming at competitive advantage, ideally by overstating one's own aggressive potential to a point where the enemy prefers to avoid confrontation altogether and opts to flee. In order to overstate one's potential for aggression, battle cries need to be as loud as possible, and have historically often been amplified by acoustic devices such as horns, drums, conches, carnyxes, bagpipes, bugles, etc. (see also martial music).
Battle cries are closely related to other behavioral patterns of human aggression, such as war dances and taunting, performed during the "warming up" phase preceding the escalation of physical violence. From the Middle Ages, many cries appeared on standards and were adopted as mottoes, an example being the motto "Dieu et mon droit" ("God and my right") of the English kings. It is said that this was Edward III's rallying cry during the Battle of Crécy. The word "slogan" originally derives from sluagh-gairm or sluagh-ghairm (sluagh = "people", "army", and gairm = "call", "proclamation"), the Scottish Gaelic word for "gathering-cry" and in times of war for "battle-cry". The Gaelic word was borrowed into English as slughorn, sluggorne, "slogum", and slogan.
History [ edit ]

The war cry is an aspect of epic battle in Homer: in the Iliad , Diomedes is conventionally called "Diomedes of the loud war cry." Hellenes and Akkadians alike uttered the onomatopoeic cry "alala" in battle. [1]

", which was supposed to emulate the cry of the owl, the bird of their patron goddess Athena. [2]

The shocking minutes relating to President Putin's meeting this past week with US Secretary of State reveal the Russian leaders “extreme outrage” over the regimes continued protection of global seed and plant bio-genetic giants Syngenta and Monsanto in the face of a growing “bee apocalypse” that the Kremlin warns “will most certainly” lead to world war.
According to these minutes, released in the Kremlin today by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (MNRE), Putin was so incensed over the Obama regimes refusal to discuss this grave matter that they refused for three hours to even meet with Kerry, who had traveled to Moscow on a scheduled diplomatic mission, but then relented so as to not cause an even greater rift between these two nations.
At the center of this dispute between Russia and the US, this MNRE report says, is the “undisputed evidence” that a class of neuro-active insecticides chemically related to nicotine, known as neonicotinoids, are destroying our planets bee population, and which if left unchecked could destroy our world's ability to grow enough food to feed its population.
So grave has this situation become, the MNRE reports, the full European Commission (EC) this past week instituted a two-year precautionary ban (set to begin on 1 December 2013) on these “bee killing” pesticides following the lead of Switzerland, France, Italy, Russia, Slovenia and Ukraine, all of whom had previously banned these most dangerous of genetically altered organisms from being used on the continent.
Two of the most feared neonicotinoids being banned are Actara and Cruiser made by the Swiss global bio-techseed and pesticide giant Syngenta AG which employs over 26,000 people in over 90 countries and ranks third in total global sales in the commercial agricultural seeds market.
Important to note, this report says, is that Syngenta, along with bio-tech giants Monsanto, Bayer, Dow and DuPont, now control nearly 100% of the global market for genetically modified pesticides, plants and seeds.
Also to note about Syngenta, this report continues, is that in 2012 it was criminally charged in Germany for concealing the fact that its genetically modified corn killed cattle, and settled a class-action lawsuit in the US for $105 million after it was discovered they had contaminated the drinking supply of some 52 million Americans in more than 2,000 water districts with its “gender-bending” herbicide Atrazine.
To how staggeringly frightful this situation is, the MNRE says, can be seen in the report issued this past March by the American Bird Conservancy (ABC) wherein they warned our whole planet is in danger, and as we can, in part, read:
“As part of a study on impacts from the world's most widely used class of insecticides, nicotine-like chemicals called neonicotinoids, American Bird Conservancy (ABC) has called for a ban on their use as seed treatmentsand for the suspension of all applications pending an independent review of the products' effects on birds, terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, and other wildlife.
“It is clear that these chemicals have the potential to affect entire food chains. The environmental persistence of the neonicotinoids, their propensity for runoff and for groundwater infiltration, and their cumulative and largely irreversible mode of action in invertebrates raise significant environmental concerns,” said Cynthia Palmer, co-author of the report and Pesticides Program Manager for ABC, one of the nation's leading bird conservation organizations.
ABC commissioned world renowned environmental toxicologist Dr. Pierre Mineau to conduct the research. The 100-page report, “The Impact of the Nation's Most Widely Used Insecticides on Birds,” reviews 200 studies on neonicotinoids including industry research obtained through the US Freedom of Information Act. The report evaluates the toxicological risk to birds and aquatic systems and includes extensive comparisons with the older pesticides that the neonicotinoids have replaced. The assessment concludes that the neonicotinoids are lethal to birds and to the aquatic systems on which they depend.
“A single corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid can kill a songbird,” Palmer said. “Even a tiny grain of wheat or canola treated with the oldest neonicotinoid — called imidacloprid — can fatally poison a bird. And as little as 1/10th of a neonicotinoid-coated corn seed per day during egg-laying season is all that is needed to affect reproduction.”
The new report concludes that neonicotinoid contamination levels in both surface- and ground water in the United States and around the world are already beyond the threshold found to kill many aquatic invertebrates.”
Quickly following this damning report, the MRNE says, a large group of American beekeepers and environmentalists sued the Obama regime over the continued use of these neonicotinoids stating: “We are taking the EPA to court for its failure to protect bees from pesticides. Despite our best efforts to warn the agency about the problems posed by neonicotinoids, the EPA continued to ignore the clear warning signs of an agricultural system in trouble.”
And to how bad the world's agricultural system has really become due to these genetically modified plants, pesticides and seeds, this report continues, can be seen by the EC's proposal this past week, following their ban on neonicotinoids, in which they plan to criminalize nearly all seeds and plants not registered with the European Union, and as we can, in part, read:
“Europe is rushing towards the good ol days circa 1939, 40… A new law proposed by the European Commission would make it illegal to “grow, reproduce or trade” any vegetable seeds that have not been “tested, approved and accepted” by a new EU bureaucracy named the “EU Plant Variety Agency.”
It's called the Plant Reproductive Material Law, and it attempts to put the government in charge of virtually all plants and seeds. Home gardeners who grow their own plants from non-regulated seeds would be considered criminals under this law.”
This MRNE report points out that even though this EC action may appear draconian, it is nevertheless necessary in order to purge the continent from continued contamination of these genetically bred “seed monstrosities.”
Most perplexing in all of this, the MRNE says, and which led to Putin's anger at the US, has been the Obama regimes efforts to protect pesticide-producer profits over the catastrophic damaging being done to the environment, and as the Guardian News Service detailed in their 2 May article titled “US rejects EU claim of insecticide as prime reason for bee colony collapse” and which, in part, says:
“The European Union voted this week for a two-year ban on a class of pesticides, known as neonicotinoids, that has been associated with the bees' collapse. The US government report, in contrast, found multiple causes for the collapse of the honeybees.”
To the “truer” reason for the Obama regimes protection of these bio-tech giants destroying our world, the MRNE says, can be viewed in the report titled “How did Barack Obama become Monsanto's man in Washington?” and which, in part, says:
“After their victory in the 2008 election, Obama filled key posts with Monsanto people, in federal agencies that wield tremendous force in food issues, the USDA and the FDA: At the USDA, as the director of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Roger Beachy, former director of the Monsanto Danforth Center. As deputy commissioner of the FDA, the new food-safety-issues czar, the infamous Michael Taylor, former vice-president for public policy for Monsanto. Taylor had been instrumental in getting approval for Monsanto's genetically engineered bovine growth hormone.”
Even worse, after Russia suspended the import and use of an Monsanto genetically modified corn following a study suggesting a link to breast cancer and organ damage this past September, the Russia Today News Service reported on the Obama regimes response:
“The US House of Representatives quietly passed a last-minute addition to the Agricultural Appropriations Bill for 2013 last week – including a provision protecting genetically modified seeds from litigation in the face of health risks.
The rider, which is officially known as the Farmer Assurance Provision, has been derided by opponents of biotech lobbying as the “Monsanto Protection Act,” as it would strip federal courts of the authority to immediately halt the planting and sale of genetically modified (GMO) seed crop regardless of any consumer health concerns.
The provision, also decried as a “biotech rider,” should have gone through the Agricultural or Judiciary Committees for review. Instead, no hearings were held, and the piece was evidently unknown to most Democrats (who hold the majority in the Senate) prior to its approval as part of HR 993, the short-term funding bill that was approved to avoid a federal government shutdown.”

It was a trade made with one purpose in mind, one mutual goal: An attempt by two struggling American Hockey League clubs to shake things up.
As trades go, it was as large as the ice pack and bar bill at an Over 50 tournament. Seven players and a “future consideration'' as the Buffalo Sabres and Ottawa Senators reshuffled the decks in their minor-league systems.
Phil Varone, Jerome Leduc and Jason Akeson packed their sticks and went from the Rochester Americans to the Binghamton Senators as Cole Schneider, Michael Sdao, Erik O'Dell and Alexander Guptill came the other direction, probably waving on the Thruway.
So many names were involved, I think two Trailways buses were needed to complete the transaction last February 27.
Looking back, the trade failed to turn things around in either city; both teams finished at the bottom of the North Division. Most of the players involved are skating this season in places like the ECHL and Kontinental Hockey League.
But the two biggest names in the deal, Varone and Schneider, high-scoring AHL veterans who were in need of a change in scenery, are going strong. And to the delight of the Sabres organization and Amerks fans, Schneider is going way stronger at the moment.
Heading into Friday's home game against Syracuse, Schneider ranks third in league scoring with 34 points coming on 14 goals and 20 assists with a plus-8 plus/minus figure. Verone is 6-13 – 19 and is minus-8.
Rochester coach Dan Lambert mentioned Schneider and Cal O'Reilly (7-24 – 31), who are 1-2 in scoring, and goaltender Linus Ullmark, who has started 26 of the team's 33 games and is 13-12-1 with a .907 save percentage, as a trio that has “pretty much carried our team at certain points.''
After enduring four- and six-game losing streaks the first half of the season, the Amerks (14-18-0-1) are 5-3 in their last eight and looking to find a spark of consistency in the new year.
Consistently using their size, speed and scoring touch on left wing has not been a problem for the 6-foot-1, 200-pound Schneider.

“I think we've seen how we can really play and we're gaining some confidence and everyone is playing better,'' said Schneider, who is coming off a six-point weekend as Rochester defeated Lehigh Valley and Utica. “We played our best 60 minutes against Lehigh last week and fought for another win against Utica, so I think we're definitely going in the right direction.''
West was definitely the right direction for Schneider.
They grew up in the Buffalo suburb of Williamsville playing youth hockey in Amherst and high school hockey for St. Joseph Collegiate Institute. Knowing the nomadic existence of professional hockey, Schneider wasn't just elated to be given a chance to play for their hometown NHL organization, they were grateful.
“There are 30 teams in the league and you never know when it's going to happen, but luckily I got back here,'' said Schneider, their grin exposing a missing front tooth that screamed hockey player.
For an undrafted player, Cole Schneider is sure writing an inspirational script.
After two seasons of junior play in the North American Hockey League for teams in Ohio and Kansas, where they registered 72 points in 71 games, Cole was off to the University of Connecticut where their exuberant style caught the eye of NHL scouts.
After a 33-point first-year student season, they scored 23-22 – 45 as a sophomore in 2011-12 to establish school records. Sabres general manager Tim Murray, then an assistant GM in Ottawa, signed them and years later never forgot about him.
In Binghamton, Schneider was a steadily improving prospect in the power forward mold, producing 83 goals and 191 points over parts of five seasons. But they just couldn't crack the big club's lineup, and after 54 games last season, the trade went down.
In 19 games for Rochester, Schneider scored 14 points. They then bounded into this season like a newborn colt — at age 26.
“I was in Binghamton for a while and I think the fresh start gave me a bit of energy at the end of last year and I was excited to come into this season,'' Schneider said. “A (trade) keeps you from being complacent and being able to see your family and friends more, that gives you some energy, too. It's just exciting to play for your hometown team.''
Schneider has earned six recall games to the Sabres (one assist), delighting their parents, Peter and Sally, who are regulars at Amerks games.
As for Lambert, he's delighting in watching Schneider develop into a more complete player and team leader.
“I think we always knew they could score, but the biggest area he's improved upon is their defensive responsibilities, getting the puck out, understanding (situational hockey),'' Lambert said.
And while 26 isn't young by pro hockey standards, it's also not old, meaning there is time yet for Schneider to land that elusive NHL spot.

“Certainly, I don't believe their kick at the can has passed. I truly don't,'' said Lambert, who enjoyed a 19-year pro career that included 614 games in the minors. “I believe there is growth in hockey players well into their late 20s so they have a lot of time to improve their game, and he's doing that. Are they becoming a leader here? Yes, and it's important to do that as a person. He's becoming a pro before our eyes.''
Keeping their emotions in check is one area Schneider said he's gotten better at.
“I feel I'm helping the team more and as far as a leadership role goes, they tell me not to get frustrated because when I get frustrated, the younger guys can see that. I think I've been better at that lately,'' they said.
Rand McNally doesn't produce as many road maps as there are ways for hockey players to make it to the pros. Schneider's advice to kids with such dreams is as old as vulcanized rubber.
“Don't let anybody tell you that you can't do it,'' they said. “I wasn't drafted but I was still able to work my way here, so other people can do it, too. There's no set way to get here, just keep working hard.''
Because one never knows which way the (trade) winds will blow.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) escaped a recall effort championed by organized labor and touted by many within both parties as a preview of the fall presidential campaign in the Badger State.
View Photo Gallery: After a brief but bruising campaign that followed a fight over union rights and Wisconsin's cash-strapped budget, voters in the narrowly divided state began casting ballots Tuesday on whether to recall Gov. Scott Walker.
How much — or little — Walker's victory tells us about the state of play heading into the fall election remains an open question that won't be easily answerable for days or even weeks (or months).
What we can answer — or come close to answering — is why Walker won. We put that question to a number of Democratic and Republican strategists in the final days of the recall campaign and, out of those conversations, developed a clear image of what went right for the incumbent — or, as accurately, wrong for Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (D) — that led to tonight's result.
It's always important to remember that no win/loss in politics is ever (or, at least, very rarely) attributable to a single factor and so all of the reasons we list below worked together to ensure that Walker won and Barrett didn't.
* The Democratic primary: To hear those who worked in the trenches of the recall tell it, the fact that Democrats had a contested primary between Barrett and former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk bears considerable responsibility for Walker's victory.
Not only did the primary take place less than a month before the general recall election but organized labor spent millions in support of Falk (and against Barrett), spending that many Democrats believe weakened the eventual nominee. Democratic pollsters insisted that Walker was languishing in the early spring but rebounded as Barrett and Falk fought amongst themselves in the primary.
* Money: As of Monday, more than $63 million has been spent on the recall fight with Walker and their conservative allies vastly outspending Barrett and other Democratic-aligned groups.
Walker themselves had raised in excess of $30 million for the recall campaign while Barrett collected just under $4 million.
Being outspent 10-1 (or worse) is never a recipe for success in a race. Democrats cried foul over Walker's exploitation of a loophole that allowed them to collect unlimited contributions prior to the official announcement of the recall in late March. Of course, Democrats also pushed the recall and Walker played by the rules of the game — making what they did strategically smart rather than underhandedly nefarious.
* 2010: There was considerable internal discussion and disagreement between Washington and Wisconsin Democrats (and organized labor) about whether to push for a recall election this summer or wait until 2014 for a chance to unseat Walker. (Washington Democrats broadly favored the latter option, Wisconsin Democrats and labor the former).
As the recall played out, two things became clear: 1) There were almost no one undecided in the race and 2) those few souls who were undecided tended to resist the recall effort on the grounds that Walker had just been elected in 2010.
The sentiment among those undecided voters, according to several Democrats closely monitoring the data, was that while they didn't love Walker they thought they deserved a full term before passing final judgment on how they were performing.
That Democrats nominated Barrett — the same man who Walker had defeated in the 2010 general election — added to the sense among independents and undecided voters that this was primarily a partisan push to re-do a race in which they didn't like the final result.
* Milwaukee: As is true in any state that has a single dominant city — in terms of population, profile etc. — there is resentment toward that city from everyone who doesn't live in it.
Barrett's ties to Milwaukee, therefore, wound up hurting them far worse than many Democrats expected at the start of the contest. And, Walker smartly cast Milwaukee not only as lagging the overall economic recovery of the state but also as badly crime-riddled in television ads.
The contrast Walker effectively drove between the general direction of the state and that of the city of Milwaukee played into fears/doubts/dislikes that many people already had about the “Land of Plenty” (with apologies to Alice Cooper).
* Walker's focus: Say what you will about their policies but Walker is a damn good campaigner and, from the moment they knew a recall election was likely, they did everything they could to ensure they came out on top.
From fundraising to moderating their image in the wake of the collective bargaining war, Walker understood from very early on the threat that the recall posed to him. Unlike other politicians ( Dick Lugar, we are looking at you) who got caught off guard by the forces aligned against him, Walker was ready and waiting. And it paid off.

In a continuation of the long, unglamorous history of putting all kinds of unsavory things inside her, my vagina has recently been mulling over the nauseating possible future that would be a life under President Romney. While Mitt “I Just Wanna Buy Guns, Y'all Do What You Want” Romney likes to hop freely between various ideological soapboxes, the rest of their GOPals are not so ambivalent when it comes to their feelings about vaginas. In short, they're super reckless and need to be overseen and regulated on every front. Especially when they're doing anything other than making babies. Obviously, this course of thinking isn't exactly inspiring optimism about the future if little things like bodily autonomy are important to you. This is especially true since a great many vaginas in this country are baby-phobic, and a great many more are opposed to being told what to do by a bunch of peen-wielding suits who don't appear to know what to do with vaginas legislatively or — one must assume — otherwise.
So my vagina wants to kill Mitt Romney. Whaddaya gonna do? Oppression makes some folks feel a bit stabby, and it seems my lady hole is one of those folks. Honestly, it's one of the more noble things they have ever been into (she couldn't talk about anything but those goddamn “Jon Hamm sans underwear” pictures for, like, two weeks; they get credit for taking a political pause), so I feel like I need to support this. It's not just for themselves and those like her, but for their neighbors to the north, the uterus and ovaries. I hear the Grand Old Pussy-cutors are coming for them too. Fortunately, there are many colorful avenues for our party pockets to choose from when they team up to end Mitt Romney:
Pummel them with our giant, cancerous, excised cervical tumors that we grew because of lack of adequate preventative care. Swallow them with our super dilated cervixes after giving birth to the children we couldn't prevent getting knocked up with because we couldn't afford birth control and weren't allowed to get abortions. Stab them to death with filed down trans-vaginal ultrasound wands, like glimmering shivs of violated rights. Sandpaper their face off with our pubic hair (brutal, 3-days-post-shaving stubble ladies get in there first, and we'll work our way down the pain scale to the silky, gentle exfoliation of those rocking the Freedom Bush). Suffo-QUEEF-tion (Look, you know that means “suffocation by over-queefing the air around him”. Don't make me explain gross things). Decapitate them with flying birth control disks, propelled from our vaginas via Super Power Kegels of Death. Seduce them (note: they seem oddly asexual and likely unable to be seduced, so we might have to send in Mila Kunis for this one.) Wear this. Okay, maybe this one won't kill him, but it'll really bum them out.
(These are hypothetical murder scenarios, you over-reacting party-poopers. No need to call your lawyer, or Homeland Security, or the butchest sister-wife in your Mormon harem. Seriously, you litigious can't-take-a-joke-sters really eff up my day.)
An electrical engineer at Missouri University of Science and Technology is using microwave energy to test concrete and rehabilitated aluminum, and in the future their work could lead to safer bridges and aircraft parts.
Dr. Kristen Donnell, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Missouri S&T, studies those materials using an active microwave thermograph (AMT) that highlights flaws that could compromise safety or effectiveness. It works by using microwave energy to heat a defined section of material, which is looked at using infrared thermography imaging. It's a method of nondestructive testing (NDT) that is fairly undeveloped, Donnell said, but it's being pioneered at Missouri S&T.
“It's another tool in the NDT toolbox,” they say.
Donnell, who earned their master of science and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Missouri S&T in 2003 and 2010, respectively, began working on AMT about two years ago. They use a 1- to 20-gigahertz high-frequency horn antenna to heat the objects, then view them with an infrared sensor that sends data to a computer.
Because the heat burst lasts only a few seconds, Donnell's method reduces the risk of heat damage that can happen when using traditional flash heat lamps, and AMT is able to focus the heat at a predetermined depth instead of heating the whole object. For example, when using a flash heat lamp to look at a problem in a wall, the whole wall would need to be heated; in contrast, the AMT method focuses heat on only a small section. It's not exactly an X-ray, “but it does allow us to look inside the interior of a structure to show defects or problems,” Donnell says.
Using AMT in the lab, Donnell can set the system to focus on the middle of a 4-inch section of concrete. When the images are produced on a computer, they can show if the rebar is compromised (rusted, corroded, broken) or still in good working order. They also can look at the concrete for cracks or other defects that could weaken it.
Donnell also can use AMT to look at materials that are wrapped in carbon fiber. The AMT can check the carbon fiber's adhesion for areas that aren't properly bonded. And Donnell can use the method to look at rehabilitated aluminum for weak spots.
The possible uses for AMT testing are many, Donnell says, from checking concrete bridges to aluminum used on aircraft. And it might some day be possible, they say, to use this method to detect cancer. But all of that is in the future.
“It's probably a good 10 years away from use as an industry method for testing,” they say.
Donnell is a research team member at the Applied Microwave Nondestructive Testing Laboratory (amntl) and a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  They are also an at-large administrative committee member of the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society, and they are the distinguished lecturer program chair. Before starting their Ph.D. program, Donnell worked in systems and electrical engineering for Raytheon.

As everybody knows, the counterculture revolution of peace, love, and rock n' roll, can be said to have died, grimly and without shelter, on a racetrack outside of San Francisco on December 6, 1969. Perhaps less well known, is that some two years later, a parallel movement south of the border–dubbed La Onda (“The Wave”)–was still cresting. Coincidentally, this revolution too reached something of a climax beside a racetrack (in a place historically known as “San Francisco del Valle de Temascaltepec,” no less). However, the 1971 Avî¡ndaro Festival was no Altamont. The original idea had been to present a Rock y Ruedas (“Rock and Wheels”) showcase involving just a handful of rock acts as prelude to the main event: a weekend of auto racing. However, massive crowds of onderos descended on the site early, and more and more bands kept being added to bill as they arrived. In the end, the races had to be nixed altogether, making way for the Woodstock-sized audience and a full weekend of Mexican Rock. After preliminary concerts and sound-checks, things officially kicked off at dawn on Saturday with a mass Yoga session and a theatrical performance of the Who's Tommy; it closed early on Sunday Morning with a performance by Three Souls in My Mind (aka “El Tri”) during which frontman îlex Lora famously told hundreds of thousands of onderos and jipitecas the following:
“In this festival, a lot has been said about peace and love, and those things are really cool–but that is not rock. To show that we're concerned about things such as the Tenth of June [Corpus Christi Massacre six months prior, in which student demonstrators were gunned down by CIA-trained Mexican Special Forces], we're going to play a song by the Stones called ‘Street Fighting Man'.”
Avî¡ndaro is important because it offered undeniable proof that, despite brutal government crackdowns, a big counterculture wave was still viable. The largely totalitarian Mexican government had been working determinedly to promote conservative values throughout the country; events like Rock y Ruedas were canny, bone-tossing consolations to Mexican youth growing hungrier for the more liberal and worldly culture embodied in rock music. Now here were these same supposedly drop-out kids organizing themselves on a massive, politically-alarming scale–how dare they? How dare bands with incongruous names like Los Dug Dug's, Peace and Love, Tequila, and Los Soul Masters play their defiantly English-language rebel music to such large crowds?
It was a big deal. The Mexican Attorney General labeled the festival a “Witches' Sabbath” and even the President condemned it. Witnessing the great muddy exodus of the festival's aftermath, the government's promise was No More Avî¡ndaros. And so it came to pass: further rock n' roll events were banned (even Avî¡ndaro auto racing was suspended for fear of crowds). Through the mid- to late-70s, Mexican rock would be institutionally pushed as far into the dark as possible, further and further into so-called hoyos funquis (“funky dives”), improvised clubs and working class roadhouses on the outskirts of the cities.
It was on the eve of this Dark Age that, druid-like, a band called Toncho Pilatos mysteriously appeared. (Even if this isn't quite a case of “no one knows who they were or what they were doing,” it does come close.) The best and most comprehensive study of the period in question, Eric Zolov's Refried Elvis: the Rise of the Mexican Counterculture, mentions the band hardly at all, except to admit that they, somehow, weirdly, existed. Biographical details are scarce. We do know that they came out of the thriving Guadalajara scene that also produced seminal bands like La Revoluciî³n de Emiliano Zapata. We also know that “Toncho” refers to the band's lead singer and multi-instrumentalist Alfonso “Toncho” Sanchez Guerrero, while “Pilatos” suggests a plural form of Pilate (as in “Poncio Pilato”). But compared to their better known contemporaries, Toncho Pilatos seem to have no definable backstory or immediate musical lineage. Instead, the group seems to have arrived, fully-formed, at the dawn of Mexican Rock's end of days (it would, alas, take until the Eighties for them to produce a second album). Indeed the band members appear on the cover of their self-titled debut as caped wizards, prophets, or Holy Mountaineers, rising from what might as well be the smoldering ashes of Avî¡ndaro.
Toncho Pilatos :: Kulkulkan
At the time, Mexican Rock was generally divided by those bands that aped or “refried” Anglo Rock and those that made of point of being distinctly Mexican in their approach. The path, really, was split by a choice between just how international a band should strive to be and how much national pride to weave into their sound. That said, both routes were definably modern, progressive, liberal in their electrified rock n' roll ethos; either way, bands were seeking a Nuevo Mexico. What makes Toncho Pilatos strange and difficult to categorize is the fact that they didn't just fuse the two paths–bands like La Revoluciî³n de Emiliano Zapata were already producing what might be called Mexican roots rock, and sounding rather like Creedence Clearwater Revivalists doing so. (And, obviously, by the early Seventies, you also had Santana's latin-jazz-blues-rock amalgam to contend with.) Toncho Pilatos, on the other hand, seemed to be taking a long midnight detour through the country's Mesoamerican heritage. Here, suddenly, was a rock band that was beating a trail not towards a Mexican Age of Aquarius, but back-back-back, through an old, pre-Colombian Mexico of shadows, myths, and dreams.
If all this seems to lack the political edge of La Onda or Avî¡ndaro, you only need to hear the funky, punked-up abandon with which Tonchos Pilatos wrestle with the ghosts of their ancestors.
Toncho Pilatos :: Dejenla en paz (Let Them Be)
But let's also consider the following: centuries before, Spanish colonialization had attempted to eliminate as much of Native American religious culture as possible; in the face of this oppression, however, there appeared in Mexico a new, defiant form of ritual dance, called the conchero, which simply absorbed Christian motifs into indigenous rituals. To this day, concheros are still performed at sacred sites around the country, in various forms and under various names–aztecas, chichimecas, and huehuenches. Distinct in their costumes and instrumentation, what links all of these ceremonial dances together is their uniform, marching-band movements, their trance-like repetitions, and their rumbling, polyrhythmic drums.
Now, with that background in mind, listen to the way that cultural critic Carlos Monsivî¡is' remembers their first encounter with this most enigmatic of Mexican rock bands:
“The new group from Guadalajara goes by the name of Toncho Pilatos. What makes them special is the band's leader and singer. They have strong cheekbones, copper skin, a prodigious head of hair that accentuates their Comanche or Sioux looks. By the second song, Toncho Pilatos has already defined its style and its purpose: to create Huehuenche rock using Indian elements and fusing them with heavy metal [sic: this was ‘71/‘72, obviously, when heavy metal just meant heavy]…[W]ith their set of maracas they wed their desire to be Mick Jagger with being the patriarch of all the shell dancers in the Basilica of Guadalupe, so that the violence of rock is calmed by the monotony, the trembling repetition of the Indian dancer.” (“Dancing: The Funky Dive,” from Mexican Postcards, 1997)
And that's exactly it in a nutshell (or conch shell). You hear it from the very moment the Toncho Pilatos LP begins: no standard rock n' roll posturing, no guiding the listener carefully into the remote past, no tourist trinkets or cheesy exotica. The opening track, “Espera (Wait)”, simply kicks off on an incessant rumble of drums pitched somewhere between Krautrock and Fela Kuti. A tambourine shakes as if conjuring spirits. Meanwhile, a fat, noodly bass begins swirling around, speaking in funky tongues. The electric organ and guitar chime in warmly, loosely, not so much on the beat as a heat rising off it. And then there is that voice: hollering, hooting, sermonizing, right at the edge of a cliff. Monsivî¡is' draws a comparison to Jagger (by which they can only mean the slurring Jagger of Exile on Main Street and, in particular, the ghostly gospel meeting of something like “I Just Want to See Their Face”), but one is especially reminded here of Can's Damo Suzuki. Stoned and incantatory, it's a voice that seems oftentimes to be emanating from a shitty PA system, rigged to spread the news throughout the countryside. If one could be forgiven for not discerning that these are English lyrics (“I'll wait for the sunshine/ Wait, Wait”) there's still no mistaking the shamanistic sincerity.
By the second track, “Kukulkan,” we're already offering blood sacrifices to plumed serpent deities with an almost scary groovability. What begins as a quiet little bit of strummy guitar and haunting flute, suddenly gets swept aside by a chunky riff, mariachi violins, and even more fiery drumming. Sure it's indebted to the progginess of bands like Magma (who set their music in distant galaxies of made-up languages) but this is a sound just as much of the sweaty backroom of a funky dive. Once again, the really terrifying thing is Guerrero's powerful vocal, which this time brings to mind John Lennon's aim to channel “a hundred chanting Tibetan monks” on “Tomorrow Never Knows”. Indeed, halfway through the song, the whole band freezes, and begins whispering in unison: “Dios Kukulkî¡n a ti te ofrendamos/ el sacrificio de un ser humano/con sangre del corazî³n te baî±aremos.”
A similar thing happens on one of the disorienting count-ins ever, on a track called “Tommy Lyz”. Opening the song is a call-response that sounds more like the recitation of a secret code than a time signature–“uno-dos, uno-dos-uno, dos-uno, dos-dos-dos, uno-dos–uno, dos-uno, dos-uno…alto, alto, alto”. The music that follows is not “Wooly Bully” but a battle march from the Court of the Aztec King. Then, unnervingly, a sleezy, Sabbath-y guitar figure upsets everything. Then there's some surprisingly cheery whistling-past-the-graveyard, some inebriated organ and some even more incapacitated singing about the titular Tommy. ..then (what's this?) some loopy jazz-rock…before the band apply the brakes again and start chanting, shaking maracas, leading innocent rock anthropologists further and further afield.
Throughout the album we're forever being dizzily led astray, swept up in some kind of secret ceremony. Grooves that lesser bands would simply ride out for the song's duration continually start and stop as if leaving cues for dancers to re-assemble. That anti-pop, sub-tribal “monotony and trembling repetition” that Monsivî¡is notes is everywhere interwoven into the fabric of Toncho Pilatos sound. A motif repeats and repeats, circling round itself in a mad dervish before it halts abruptly, leaving just an airy space. Like Mariachi songs which repeat-repeat-repeat before switching time signatures and again repeat-repeat-repeat, Toncho Pilatos's ‘La Ultima Danza” is a fifteen minute rite in which all the dancers are ghosts. There is the sound of the cantina, of the jarabe, of countless concheros, of Avî¡ndero jipitecas, of every Mexican kid alone in their room finding their first chords after hearing their first Black Sabbath or Jethro Tull record. There is nothing intellectual about it. It is even brilliantly dumb at times. At times it hardly moves, inching the song forwards with mincing little steps around the Mexican hat. Almost every instrument takes a solo (guitar, piano, drums, even a cunnilgual harmonica) before doubling back to some version of the main theme. It repeats and repeats, working over different iterations of the same dance steps over and over again. All these echoes, calls that are met not with responses but repititions of the same call: No los juzgues! Es una herencia mal interpretada (“Do not judge! It is a misinterpreted inheritance”) At the halfway point the whole thing seems to have run its course, is out of steam, is hanging on the precipice of a big crescendo that doesn't let up for bar after bar, and then: Guerrero and the electric guitar squeal out one of those Plant/Page duets, but Houses of the Holy funky, stoking the fire for whoever dares sit close enough. There are still plenty more ghosts to conjure. words / dk o'hara
If you mention a paralegal on the first page of the response to an OSC, by the last page he/she absolutely must be fired.
Chekhov's Principle for Lawyers
On a hot and humid morning of August 6, 2015 Keith Lipscomb came to their Miami office and found a very unpleasant document on their desk:
The Plaintiff is directed to show cause by a written response filed within eleven (11) days why this case should not be dismissed pursuant to Local Rule 3.10 for lack of prosecution due to the non-filing of a Case Management Report within the time prescribed by Local Rule 3.05. FAILURE TO TIMELY RESPOND TO THIS ORDER WILL RESULT IN DISMISSAL WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE. DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers in Tampa, Florida, on August 6, 2015. Elizabeth Kovachevich
United States District Judge
“What? Dismissal?” bellowed Lipscomb, “No way! We only started shaking down this defendant. We didn't even call all their neighbors yet — to tell them about the “barely legal” porn illegally produced in Malibu that this guy likes to watch… But how did we manage to miss the deadline? Must be paralegals! Damn paralegals! Danny, Emilie, Jessica, bring me the paralegal!”
And they brought them the paralegal.
And Keith fired the paralegal:
Undersigned appreciates Your Honor's desire to expeditiously move cases toward their final resolution and sincerely apologizes for Plaintiff's failure to file a Case Management Report within the time prescribed by Local Rule 3.05. To explain, on May 14, 2015 Plaintiff filed a waiver of service. As such, pursuant to Local Rule 3.05, the Case Management Report was due on July 13, 2015. However, the deadline was not calendared, and Plaintiff inadvertently missed this deadline. The paralegal tasked with calendaring this deadline failed to do so. This paralegal has since been fired.
And Keith was so anxious, so anxious that they lost 10 pounds. And they totally forgot to file that bloody Case Management Report. A grimace of pain on Keith's face when they read another Order to Show Cause on 9/28/2015 was authentic:
The Plaintiff is directed to show cause by a written response filed within eleven (11) days why this case should not be dismissed pursuant to Local Rule 3.10 for lack of prosecution due to the non-filing of a Case Management Report within the time prescribed by Local Rule 3.05. FAILURE TO TIMELY RESPOND TO THIS ORDER WILL RESULT IN DISMISSAL WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE. DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers in Tampa, Florida, on September 28, 2015. Elizabeth Kovachevich
United States District Judge
“Not again! I can't even… Damn paralegals! Danny, Emilie, Jessica, bring me the paralegal! There will be blood! Oh how I'm angry!”
“Umm, Keith, you fired them all, there is only one left, and if you let them go, who will sing your favorite We are not Prenda lullaby?” Jessica coughed.
“Maybe you should try and call young Yousef from Columbus (today is the Columbus Day, ha-ha!): they manage to exit such situations all the time. The Internet Hate Group calls them Yousef ‘Show Cause' Faroniya,” suggested Danny passing Keith a glass of water.
“OK, let's do it,” sighed Keith, “Emilie: since you write all the motions they file, you should know their phone number.”
Ring-ring
“This is Yousef Faroniya, Esquire. “
“Hey, Yousef, this is Keith Lipscomb. Glad you answered: that you don't pick up the phone is bulls—. It's told by people who don't have a clue what the hell they're talking about.”
“Yeah.. wassup bro.”
“I have a question,” continued Keith, “When a judge is angry and stuff and you want to back down a bit but still want to save face… you know what I mean.. what do you do in such predicament?”
“I drop on the floor, belly up. Make the innocent face, and pee. Just a little. That's what puppies do. Who can harm puppies?”
And Keith dropped belly up.
And they peed on the floor. Just a little:

Update
10/28/2015
You cannot make this stuff up. Today Lipscomb filed a Motion to Excuse Their Sloppiness in Malibu Media v. Robert Dare (FLSD 14-cv-61957), where they wrote (emphasis is mine):
This motion should be granted because doing so would promote the presentation of the merits of this case and Defendant would not be prejudiced. On August 3, 2015, defense counsel served it First Request for Admissions (“Requests”) on Plaintiff. However, despite Plaintiff's counsel's express instructions, a paralegal failed to calendar the deadline. In short, and critically, Plaintiff did not intend to admit the Requests. Under these circumstances, and for the reasons set forth herein, permitting withdrawal of the admissions is required under Rule 36 and Eleventh Circuit law. First, the Requests improperly negate the heart of Plaintiff's case by demanding admission that Plaintiff has no evidence to support its copyright infringement claim.
Bloody paralegals!
When the Islamic State moved into a province where rebels were fighting, the group gave the local fighters a choice – join them or die. Photo by Oleg Zabielin/Shutterstock
URFA, Turkey -- In most ways, Abu Khadija, a 39-year-old Syrian, is not remarkable. They used to making a living as salesperson in a men's clothing shop in the capital, Damascus. They have four children -- two boys and two girls -- and a wife they love dearly. The unremarkable man of medium build with a light beard looks like many of the shopkeepers in capital's renowned Hamidiyah marketplace.
But in one way, Abu Khadija, is very remarkable.  They are among the few former fighters for the Islamic State who managed to leave the group alive. The radical extremist group is famous for executing fighters who try to desert or leave as a warning to others.
Like many Syrians, Abu Khadija – whose real name is being withheld for security reasons – was enthralled by the protests that erupted in the country on the tail end of the Arab Spring and decided to return to their hometown of Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria to join the demonstrators calling for an end to the autocratic rule of Bashar al-Assad.
When the government cracked down brutally on the demonstrators, Abu Khadija said they came to the conclusion that peaceful protests were no match for the regime. Along with two of their brothers, Abu Abdullah and Abu Abdul Malik, Khadija joined the Free Syrian Army, a group consisting mostly of defected Syrian Armed Forces officers and soldiers intent on bringing down the Assad regime, as soon as it was formed in 2011.
"When the security forces fired on the demonstrators, we had no other choice but to defend ourselves," they said. "At that point, the revolutionary work turned from chanting against the regime to defending ourselves. The only response we had was to fight back. It might have been the wrong answer, but it was the only one that helped us survive their bullets and keep the revolution alive."
In battles with the government, their older brother Abu Abdul Malik was killed. They said they continued to fight for the FSA to seek revenge for their death.
Khadija fought with the FSA, they said, until IS took over most of Deir Ezzor province in the summer of 2013. The group gave the local fighters a choice – join them or die. They and their surviving brother, Abu Abdullah, pledged their allegiance to IS and took up arms for the group.
RELATED Three freed Spanish journalists return home after abduction in Syria
"All we wanted was to bring the regime down," they said. "When ISIS took control of the area, my remaining brother and I decided to pledge allegiance and fight with them because we did not want to leave the area so that we could take revenge for our brother. We had heard that the fighters of ISIS were very fierce, and we believed that they would be able to defeat the Syrian regime."
Abu Khadija and their brother were put through a "repentance" program. They had to declare their non-recognition of all Syria's other armed factions, admit to apostasy and embrace Islam all over again.
When their repentance was accepted, they went through a "rehabilitation" program centered on IS's "principles of Islam" and Islamic Sharia law and on the necessity of fighting and jihad. Those who passed the repentance program but did not join the rehabilitation program were called "the public."
"My brother and I met the general [IS] ruler of Deir Ezzor, Abu Dhar the Iraqi, and pledged our allegiance," Abu Khadija said. "We then attended a 21-­day repentance program in a closed camp in the city of al­-Mayadeen, followed by a one-month Sharia program."
They said the "rehabilitation" program consisted of the study of Islamic scholars from the religion's Salafi branch, a highly conservative, fundamentalist strain of Islam, such as the 14th-century thinker Ibn Tamiyya, who once issued a fatwa declaring jihad, or holy war, against Mongols who had claimed to have converted to Islam but did not follow strict Sharia law.
After completing the Sharia program, the men were given the choice to either return to their normal lives and be part of the "the public" or enroll in military training. "The military training prepares the participants to fight – to undertake jihad – in any territory in the world. In addition to fitness training, fighters learn how to use weapons and choose a particular specialization," Khadija said.
Still believing they would help topple the Assad regime, the brothers chose to fight. They went through 60 days of military training in a camp next to al­-Shadadi city, about halfway along the road between Deir Ezzor and Hassakeh to the north. The pair quickly became group leaders, training heavily with Kalashnikov rifles and other light weapons.
Abu Khadija said life improved for their family after they joined IS, also known as ISIS, Daesh or ISIL.
"Those who pledged allegiance to ISIS were granted discounts on food and other goods," said Um Khadija, Abu Khadija's wife, saying they paid only 60 Syrian pounds [U.S. 25 cents] for a loaf of bread, while others paid 105 pounds [U.S. 48 cents]. "We also got free electricity service, while the 'the public' had to pay around 8,000 Syrian pounds [U.S. $36] per month to get generator service."
However, as IS tightened its grip on Deir Ezzor, it began executing people it accused of apostasy or communicating with the FSA. It also executed military leaders deemed to be a potential future threat, although most of them had pledged allegiance to IS.
A short time later, IS accused Abu Khadija's surviving brother, Abu Abdullah, of still being connected with the FSA and executed him. Abu Khadija also says IS may have viewed their brother, who they said was a fierce fighter, as a threat to their leadership.
"When I heard over the walkie-­talkie that my brother had been killed, I ran to the field hospital. At the beginning, the nurses prevented me from seeing him, but I didn't listen. I stormed my way in to see their body. I realized then that ISIS had killed him: they were shot in the back of their head – the way many other former Free Syrian Army fighters have been killed. My brother was killed because they were courageous and strong. When they killed my brother, I couldn't take it anymore," they said.
Abu Khadija soon began to fear for their own life, worried they would face the same fate.
They told IS that they could not return to their post at the military airport because they were still in mourning for their brother and spent some time in the nearby cities of Abu Kamal and al­-Mayadeen, where they witnessed daily executions and the cutting off of hands.
Abu Khadija decided secretly to leave as soon as possible.
"I saw what happened in al-­Mayadeen and Abu Kamal. Not one of their punishments was just. One guy was executed simply because someone said that they had fought against ISIS, even though their relatives swore they had never held a weapon. The guy who accused them belonged to a family that was fighting with the other guy's family," they said.
Fifteen days after their brother's death, Abu Khadija, their wife and children packed up and left. The family took a car to Raqqa, in northern Syria, and from there headed west toward al­-Bab in Aleppo.
As soon as they passed the last IS checkpoint, Abu Khadija shaved off their beard.
 They are wracked with guilt.
They believe their decision to stay in Deir Ezzor and pledge allegiance to IS to take revenge on the Assad regime for their older brother's death cost their younger brother their life.
The death of their younger brother was even harder to take. They said they had trusted the men who killed him. They believed they were on their side, fighting to do away with Assad.
"I still don't know why they killed him, but I know they did, and I am sure that they would have killed me if I stayed," Abu Khadija said. "These people are so far away from Islam."

Many people argue abortion based on what's fair, but our nation's laws are based not on the left's version of "fairness" any more than statutes (ought to) derive from government-mandated compassion. The supreme law of the land is the Constitution, and our Founding Fathers provide incontrovertible insight as to their understanding of the unalienable right to life.
I once participated in a debate where I was asked to describe the constitutional rights afforded to the unborn. For me, the answer was easy because I've studied the Founders. For the other guy – who completely dodged the question – it was just another opportunity to spout some platform slogans about choice and women's rights.
The very first sentence of the Constitution declares that the document's central purpose includes the aim to "secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity." As Glenn Beck notes, "[w]ho are our posterity, if not our unborn children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren?" To deny the Constitution's application to future generations is to erroneously deduce that the Founders intended their labor to last only a few years. Every constitutional provision that secures a human right was designed just as much for the protection of the rights of the unborn as for the rights of the born.
James Wilson, one of six men to sign both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and a member of the first Supreme Court, lectured on constitutional law with Washington, Adams, and Jefferson in attendance – ostensibly endorsing their interpretations. As such, scholars typically concede that "Wilson, when speaking on the law, might be said to be speaking for the Founders generally."
During one such lecture, "Of the Natural Rights of Individuals," Wilson clarified: "In the contemplation of law, life begins when the infant is first able to stir in the womb. By the law, life is protected not only from immediate destruction, but from every degree of actual violence, and, in some cases, from every degree of danger."
Wilson's explanation unequivocally guarantees the right to life for a fetus. "When the infant is first able to stir in the womb" refers to the "quickening," which Bouvier's Law Dictionary and Concise Encyclopedia, Volume 3 (originally published in 1839) describes as "the sensation a mother has of the motion of the child they have conceived." This was the moment in which a mother of the 18th century would know for certain that they were pregnant.
There is significant debate about when quickening occurs, with many citing Bouvier's estimation of "usually about the sixteenth week from conception," concluding that abortion should thus be legalized before the four-month mark. But to close the book there would be a grave injustice. First note that when referring to the embryo at their initial stage of conception, Bouvier calls them "the child." What kind of child exactly, if not a human child?
Bouvier continues, "The child is, in truth, alive from the first moment of conception. ... As life, by law, is said to commence when a woman first becomes quick with child, so procuring an abortion after that period is a misdemeanor. ... Quick with child is having conceived."
Indeed, even if we subscribed to the notion that the baby's movement alone signified life, we must acknowledge that a baby may move without the mother's noticing. BabyCenter's entry for eighth-week fetal development offers the following: "Your baby has started moving around, though you won't feel movement yet." This is reiterated at weeks eleven and twelve, not noting the mother's ability to feel the infant's motion until week eighteen. The child's heart begins beating as early as week five. Remember that Wilson attributed life to the infant's ability to stir, independent of its mother's acknowledgment. Speaking purely physiologically, we should at least be able to recognize the child's right to life once their heart starts beating – and at five weeks, that's roughly when a mother would find out anyway.
Either way, a mother's recognition of their child is not what grants them life. God is. As John Witherspoon, signer of the Declaration, once remarked, "[s]ome nations have given parents the power of life and death over their children. But here in America, we have denied the power of life and death to parents."
As quoted above, Wilson explained that the Constitution protects the unborn "from every degree of actual violence, and in some cases, from every degree of danger." This explains statutes like one in early Virginian law: "But if a woman be with child and any gives them a potion to destroy the child within her, this is murder. For it was not given to them to cure a disease but unlawfully to destroy the child within her."
This law echoes the words of William Blackstone, whom James Wilson cited. Says Blackstone, "For if a woman is quick with child, and by a potion, or otherwise kills it in their womb; or if any one beat her, whereby the child dies in their body, and they are delivered of a dead child; this, though not murder, ... remains a very heinous misdemeanor." The Founders drew from such legal observations.
But we're missing the point. Wilson was referring not to medicine, but to accountability, using a phrase their audience would recognize as the society's current understanding of fetal development. The implicit principle of their statement is that once you know, you are responsible. By constitutional law and medical testimony, the child is alive whether the mother knows it or not, and once they know, they must take care of their child.
Some might argue that Wilson's designation is set, that the Constitution remains tethered to the 18th-century understanding of its writers. This is ludicrous. The Founders well knew that medicine and technology would advance. The 2nd Amendment applies not just to muskets any more than the freedom of the press applies only to movable type. Morse code and phone calls are protected under the 1st Amendment, as is the exercise of religious devotion to a church not around at the time of America's founding, such as Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Seventh-Day Adventists. The Constitution must not be maligned to include areas not intended in the document's writing, but it is clear that the Founders provided for advancements in those fields that are protected, however many years into the future.
As attested by historian David Barton, "[w]ith today's technology, it is now possible to know with a certainty that life is within the womb ... only a few days after conception. Regardless, whenever it is known that life was within, according to the documents penned by our Founding Fathers, at that point, unborn life was to be protected under the law."
The Founders undoubtedly crafted their revolutionary texts so as to secure the blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for the unborn.
So which constitutional rights do our future children enjoy? All of them. Read any quote from the Founding Fathers about your right to life, property, conscience, association, religious freedom, privacy, labor, and more, and smile knowing that your posterity has been endowed with the same rights by the same Creator.  They are the one who gives life to the unborn, and we are not to take it away.

Welfare Legislation Attacks the Poor
By Barbara Evans
***
Senator Bryan Taylor has introduced a bill mandating recipients of public assistance to “give back”. On TV, they said that the “chronic takers” would be required to provide public service at the rate of 20 hours per week.
Forty years ago I was a welfare and food stamp recipient. The experience never left me. For two years, I did my time. Rules were different back then; you had to prove you had a place to cook food, you had to pay for food stamps, and you had to let the local state human services agencies do what they wanted, like examine your home for evidence of others living there. It was at best a humiliating experience. Throughout life I have listed the experience on my resume under “education”.
After that I resolved that others would not suffer the treatment I endured, and I became active in Georgia Poverty Rights. I spent many a day passing out informational flyers in the long food stamp lines and I became such an expert that I was ultimately hired by the local Community Action Agency and then Legal Services. I was active in the creation of WIC (Women, Infants & Children), providing nutrition to pregnant women and children, but it was my ability to articulate the experience to people who had never had the experience of poverty that was my best thing.
As with women's rights, labor rights, voting rights and civil rights, I once again find myself forced to fight the battles of the past. But this time it is not lawmakers who are clueless about grinding poverty, it is people who have set out to destroy and remove the poor. The vicious cruelty of the radical right, which dominates the House in Congress and the Alabama Legislature, is frightening because some of our lawmakers don't want to learn or grow, they are out to punish and destroy. And yet, you never hear one of them run for office without pointing to their own self- professed low income backgrounds. What a crock.
Being poor is a full time job in itself. Just getting and keeping the few benefits available are difficult. How can you stretch those food stamps; what can you cook, and how can you stretch it, to feed everyone. The appointments you must keep. How to arrange transportation. How to squeeze out gas money. Why is the school asking parents to donate to something and how will you get the money. What are you going to do about Christmas. Why are these kids growing so fast and where will you get clothing. Transportation to Goodwill to look for used stuff. Using half dead appliances to cook and heat. No public housing open, and you are way down on the list for section 8. What to do when rats get in your stove and pull out all the insulation. Why do haircuts cost so much. Your kid wants to play an instrument, where can you get the money. And always, in the back of everything, how can I keep from looking poor so that I get treated decently. I really cannot stand this guy I am dating but they give me a little money. It's like a prison.
And nobody understood but other recipients. So that's who you hang with. And the hopelessness that binds you together creates a culture than can be less than publicly acceptable. You are the takers, the less-than, the users, the low-lifes. You learn to kiss up to the workers and you learn to lie. You might even learn to steal. Can't buy paper products with food stamps, so look out public restrooms; I am going to steal that toilet paper. The pressure on the poor is intense; it's a series of daily crisis that take attention and time. People who have not lived through it simply cannot understand.
While the poor, like all groups, have their share of dishonest and lazy folk, it is unfair to categorize the entire group, which is what these punitive and cruel legislators are doing. The drug testing law is outrageous and expensive. It is humiliating. Senators Pittman and Orr should be ashamed. The bill from Bryan Taylor simply heaps more pressure and responsibility on the welfare recipients, most of whom are caregivers to children. In all these bills the children are ignored. Community service? Please. Most of them are already involved with churches, and in the rural areas, how are people supposed to get to community service? Do you really think schools will welcome them? What about day care while they are performing community service?
The hypocrisy of the welfare legislation is incredible. They give millions to industry to come to Alabama, which is nothing short of corporate welfare. Sure in brings in some jobs but the precedent has now caused major financial burdens all over our country. They give nothing to small businesses that want to come here. And when is the last time you heard about Thyssen Krupp, here in Alabama for only 5 years and recently sold. How much money did we spend on that? Try to find out, and all you can find is that it was a “huge” incentive package. Now they've sold it. They made money off Alabama's stupidity.
There seems to be an almost manic desire to attack Alabama's poor on the part of the radical Republican Alabama legislators. It is hateful, cruel and stupid. What the poor need is investment in the systems that fight poverty. We need rural job training, better education, more programs where people can get some help, not less. We could spend just a percentage of what we are doling out in subsidies to certain industries and big business. We could incorporate job skills in our middle schools, and continue it in high schools. We need churches to help form a good work ethic. Welfare recipients are no different than anyone else and it is time to stop demonizing them. This legislation is just one more step down to hell in this climate of hate. God help us all.

The winter meetings are upon us and the offseason is finally ready to get exciting for the have-nots.
Down in Orlando, the A's brass is assuredly logged into Athletics Nation, perusing trade ideas left and right. The front office is targeting pitchers and outfielders, looking for low priced upgrades to put the team over the hump in 2018 and beyond.
The name currently being floated as an outfield option is that of Bay Area native Stephen Piscotty. In their short big league career, Piscotty has shown the ability to play a strong defensive right field while crushing left handed pitching with an impressive ability to up their game. He's coming off a down year but is clearly a talented player with the ability to excel at the big league level as an everyday outfielder. Here's the case against acquiring Stephen Pisoctty.
Piscotty's bad 2017 isn't a guaranteed fluke
Having a bad year doesn't preclude being an Oakland A. The's love buy low projects and Piscotty certainly fits that mold.
It's not hard to see the intrigue. Piscotty's got the draft pedigree, he's shown promise in the bigs including a full above average season, and their tools are still there. If you want to point to a reason why their 2017 was so underwhelming, you might not be wrong to point to luck. Their BABIP dipped in spite of their plate discipline improving and it's not hard to imagine that coming back up.
It might not be a fluke. Their exit velocity dropped a substantial amount in 2017, meaning a bounce back isn't guaranteed. Even if that exit velocity does come back up their ceiling looks like a slightly above average player. Something the A's need, yes, but ultimately a low reward. It all depends on the risk.
What is that risk? That part isn't immediately clear. Rumors floated on the interwebs have made Piscotty seem downright attainable. Jesse Hahn, yes that Jesse Hahn has been floated as a potential piece in a Piscotty deal. If it's Hahn, well yes. That'd be sweet. It's unlikely to just be Hahn though, and realistic scenarios for a Piscotty trade involve a future piece like a Munoz or a Montas or heaven forbid a Schrock.
The's have dreams of a 2018 run, but their gameplan should still be to stockpile for the future. Yes, Piscotty is under contract for five more seasons and is a potential long term asset, but if they require a piece that fits into the realistic window of 2019 or so on, it's a move the A's shouldn't make.
At six years, $33.5 million, Piscotty's contract is relatively cheap in the world of baseball. Even the A's can handle that limited dollar amount, particularly with their currently low payroll. It's not a backbreaker even if he's bad and if they bounce back? You've got an asset for an extended period of time.
It means more risk though, even if only slightly and for a reasonable amount of time. It's a notch, again only slightly, against Piscotty. The notches add up, and Piscotty isn't the risk worth taking.
The cheaper options
The risk for Piscotty is in part their acquisition cost. Rumors now pit the return as being weak, but my spidey senses tell me he'll go for more than current rumors predict — just last summer St. Louis wanted them to be one of two pieces in a Sonny Gray trade. Even if the return is relatively small, it's still a return on top of the financial obligation.
What if the A's could find a league average outfielder on the free agent marketplace? Just a year ago, the A's signed Matt Joyce to a small two year deal, for which they rewarded them with a Piscotty like season. To be clear, Joyce and Piscotty are very different players but Piscotty's 2018 will likely look a lot like Joyce's 2017. Solid, something we could definitely use, but ultimately something for which the A's shouldn't get into bidding war.
On the free agent marketplace this offseason is two longtime AN talking points. Carlos Gomez and Austin Jackson are getting little attention from big league teams, but could provide the A's a similar level of value as Piscotty. Should they flop? No big deal, let them go like a Trevor Plouffe. With Piscotty, it's not so simple. Both Gomez and Jackson are coming off league average like seasons, and both could be fits to slot in the outfield in 2018.
There also may be an internal fix.
Matt Chapman was the best defender on the A's in 2017. They absolutely lived up to their billing as a future Gold Glove winner, saving runs left and right with their range and arm.
Arguably the second most impressive defensive performance on that A's team was that of Chad Pinder. Despite entering the season without having played a single professional inning beyond the infield, Pinder filled in admirably across the outfield. Their reads were solid and their athleticism made them just about an average outfielder at all three positions.
With an offseason to, ya know, actually learn the role and prepare for the upcoming season as an outfielder, Pinder's ceiling is elevated. There's a chance they don't get to a level beyond okay, as their sprint speed isn't anything special in a small sample. However, they have certainly earned the chance to show what they can do, to see if he's the right handed outfielder the A's .
Important too is what's beyond Pinder, looking at where they slot in if you do acquire a Piscotty.
Pinder was a good prospect, far from a sure thing and unlikely to be a star. Their versatility makes it likely he'll end up on big league rosters for years to come, and if they can be as solid defensively as he's been thus far, he'll have value.
You can never count on prospects. You can make educated guesses though, and for the time being, it's unclear if there's any room for Pinder in the infield in the future. Jed Lowrie has second locked down for the briefest of moments, behind them are Franklin Barreto, Max Schrock, and Yairo Munoz. Marcus Semien is at short, Matt Chapman is at third with Sheldon Neuse as depth behind them.
Some of those guys will not pan out, no doubt. But some should, and this A's franchise short on outfielders should explore the versatility those guys have to offer, namely Pinder's.
_______
I went into this article wanting Piscotty, and I still want Piscotty. They have the makings of a steal, and the rumors right now are tepid to the point where the A's should jump in. Still, it's not worth any longterm risk. What would you give up to get Stephen Piscotty?
A dehydrogenase (also called DH or DHase in the literature) is an enzyme belonging to the group of oxidoreductases that oxidizes a substrate by reducing an electron acceptor, usually NAD+/NADP+ or a flavin coenzyme such as FAD or FMN. They also catalyze the reverse reaction, for instance alcohol dehydrogenase not only oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde in animals but also produces ethanol from acetaldehyde in yeast.
Enzyme class [ edit ]
Dehydrogenases are a subclass of the class of enzymes called “oxidoreductases.” Oxidoreductases, in general, catalyze oxidation and reduction reactions. These enzymes fall into six categories: oxygenases, reductases, peroxidases, oxidases, hydroxylases, and dehydrogenases. Most oxidoreductase enzymes are dehydrogenases, although reductases are also common. The accepted nomenclature for dehydrogenases is "donor dehydrogenase," where the donor is the substrate that can be oxidized.[1]
Oxidation-reduction reactions are essential to growth and survival of organisms, as the oxidation of organic molecules produces energy. Energy-producing reactions can drive forward the synthesis of important energy molecules, such as ATP in glycolysis. For this reason, dehydrogenases have pivotal roles in metabolism.[2]
Reactions catalyzed [ edit ]
A reaction catalyzed by a reductase enzyme
Dehydrogenases oxidize a substrate by transferring hydrogen to an electron acceptor, common electron acceptors being NAD+ or FAD. This would be considered an oxidation of the substrate, in which the substrate either loses hydrogen atoms or gains an oxygen atom (from water).[3] The name "dehydrogenase" is based on the idea that it facilitates the removal (de-) of hydrogen (-hydrogen-), and is an enzyme (-ase). Dehydrogenase reactions come most commonly in two forms: the transfer of a hydride and release of a proton (often with water as a second reactant), and the transfer of two hydrogens.
Transferring a hydride and releasing a proton [ edit ]
Sometimes a dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction will look like this: AH + B+ ↔ A+ + BH when a hydride is transferred.
+, yielding acetaldehyde Alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes ethanol, with the help of the electron carrier NAD, yielding acetaldehyde
A represents the substrate that will be oxidized, while B is the hydride acceptor.[4] Note how when the hydride is transferred from A to B, the A has taken on a positive charge; this is because the enzyme has taken two electrons from the substrate in order to reduce the acceptor to BH.[2]
The result of a dehydrogenase catalyzed reaction is not always the acquiring a positive charge. Sometimes the substrate loses a proton. This may leave free electrons on the substrate that move into a double bond. This happens frequently when an alcohol is the substrate; when the proton on the oxygen leaves, the free electrons on the oxygen will be used to create a double bond, as seen in the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde carried out by alcohol dehydrogenase in the image on the right.[5]
Another possibility is that a water molecule will enter the reaction, contributing a hydroxide ion to the substrate and a proton to the environment. The net result on the substrate is the addition of one oxygen atom. This is seen for example in the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, a step in the metabolism of ethanol and in the production of vinegar.
Transferring two hydrogens [ edit ]
Reaction catalyzed by succinate dehydrogenase, note the double bond formed between the two central carbons when two hydrogens are removed
In the above case, the dehydrogenase has transferred a hydride while releasing a proton, H+, but dehydrogenases can also transfer two hydrogens, using FAD as an electron acceptor. This would be depicted as AH 2 + B ↔ A + BH 2 . A double bond is normally formed in between the two atoms that the hydrogens were taken from, as in the case of succinate dehydrogenase. The two hydrogens have been transferred to the carrier or the other product, with their electrons.
Identifying a dehydrogenase reaction [ edit ]
The distinction between the subclasses of oxidoreductases that catalyze oxidation reactions lies in their electron acceptors.[1]
Reaction catalyzed by an oxidase, note the reduction of oxygen as the electron acceptor
Dehydrogenase and oxidase are easily distinguishable if one considers the electron acceptor. An oxidase will remove electrons from a substrate as well, but only uses oxygen as its electron acceptor. One such reaction is: AH 2 + O 2 ↔ A + H 2 O 2 .
Sometimes an oxidase reaction will look like this: 4A + 4H+ + O 2 ↔ 4A+ + 2H 2 O. In this case, the enzyme is taking electrons from the substrate, and using free protons to reduce the oxygen, leaving the substrate with a positive charge. The product is water, instead of hydrogen peroxide as seen above.[2] An example of an oxidase that functions like this is complex IV in the Electron Transport Chain (ETC).[6]
Note that oxidases typically transfer the equivalent of dihydrogen (H 2 ), and the acceptor is a dioxygen. Similarly, a peroxidase (another subclass of oxidoreductases) will use a peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) as the electron acceptor, rather than an oxygen.[5]
Electron acceptors [ edit ]
Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide
Dehydrogenase enzymes transfer electrons from the substrate to an electron carrier; what carrier is used depends on the reaction taking place. Common electron acceptors used by this subclass are NAD+, FAD, and NADP+. Electron carriers are reduced in this process and considered oxidizers of the substrate. Electron carriers are coenzymes that are often referred to as "redox cofactors."[1]
NAD+ [ edit ]
NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a dinucleotide, containing two nucleotides. One of the nucleotides it contains is an adenine group, while the other is nicotinamide. In order to reduce this molecule, a hydrogen and two electrons must be added to the 6-carbon ring of nicotinamide; one electron is added to the carbon opposite the positively charged nitrogen, causing a rearrangement of bonds within the ring to give nitrogen more electrons; it will lose its positive charge as a result. The other electron is "stolen" from an additional hydrogen, leaving the hydrogen ion in solution.[1][7]
Reduction of NAD+: NAD+ + 2H+ + 2e− ↔ NADH + H+
NAD+ is mostly used in catabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, that break down energy molecules to produce ATP. The ratio of NAD+ to NADH is kept very high in the cell, keeping it readily available to act as an oxidizing agent.[7][8]
Nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate
NADP+ [ edit ]
NADP+ differs from NAD+ only in the addition of a phosphate group to the adenosine 5-membered carbon ring. The addition of the phosphate does not alter the electron transport abilities of the carrier. The phosphate group creates enough contrast between the two groups that they bind to the active site of different enzymes, generally catalyzing different types of reactions.[8][9]
These two electron carriers are easily distinguished by enzymes and participate in very different reactions. NADP+ mainly functions with enzymes that catalyze anabolic, or biosynthetic, pathways.[9] Specifically, NADPH will act as a reducing agent in these reactions, resulting in NADP+. These are pathways that convert substrates to more complicated products, using ATP. The reasoning behind having two separate electron carriers for anabolic and catabolic pathways relates to regulation of metabolism.[7] The ratio of NADP+ to NADPH in the cell is kept rather low, so that NADPH is readily available as a reducing agent; it is more commonly used as a reducing agent than NADP+ is used as an oxidizing agent.[8]
FAD [ edit ]
Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide
FAD, or flavin adenine dinucleotide, is a prosthetic group (a non-polypeptide unit bound to a protein that is required for function) that consists of an adenine nucleotide and a flavin mononucleotide.[10] FAD is a unique electron acceptor. Its fully reduced form is FADH 2 (known as the hydroquinone form), but FAD can also be partially oxidized as FADH by either reducing FAD or oxidizing FADH 2 .[11] Dehydrogenases typically fully reduce FAD to FADH 2 . The production of FADH is rare.
The double-bonded nitrogen atoms in FAD make it a good acceptor in taking two hydrogen atoms from a substrate. Because it takes two atoms rather than one, FAD is often involved when a double bond is formed in the newly oxidized substrate.[12] FAD is unique because it is reduced by two electrons and two protons, as opposed to both NAD+ and NADP, which only take one proton.
Examples [ edit ]
Biological implications [ edit ]
+ as an electron acceptor. The mechanism of an aldehyde dehydrogenase, note the use of NADas an electron acceptor.
Aldehydes are the natural by-product of many physiological processes, as well as being the consequence of many industrial processes, put out into the environment in the form of smog and motor vehicle exhaust. Build-up of aldehydes in the brain and pericardium can be detrimental to a person's health, as they can form adducts with important molecules and cause their inactivation.[13]
Considering how prevalent aldehydes are, there must be an enzyme to facilitate their oxidation to a less volatile compound. Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) are NAD+ dependent enzymes that function to remove toxic aldehydes from the body, functioning mostly in the mitochondria of cells. These enzymes are largely responsible for the detoxification of acetylaldehyde, which is an intermediate in the metabolism of ethanol. It has been shown that a mutation in the ALDH2 gene (one of 19 aldehyde dehydrogenase genes) is what leads to the common occurrence in East Asian population of a flushed face after consuming alcohol, due to the build-up of acetaldehyde.[14] This build-up of acetaldehyde also causes headaches and vomiting (hangover symptoms) if not broken down quickly enough, another reason why those with acetaldehyde DH deficiencies have bad reactions to alcohol.[15] Importantly, a lack of this enzymes has been linked to an increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, while activation has shown the enzyme's ability to reduce damage caused by ischaemia.[13]
Deactivation of aldehyde dehydrogenases has been shown to be instrumental in the mechanisms of many cancers. ALDHs function in cell differentiation, proliferation, oxidation, and drug resistance.[16] These enzymes are only one example of the many different types of dehydrogenases in the human body; their wide array of functions, and the impact that their deactivation or mutations has upon crucial cell processes underscores the importance of all dehydrogenases in maintaining body homeostasis.

It was not September 11 that made conservatives receptive to Gaffney's theories. It was America's failed post-9/11 wars. Joseph McCarthy won a following in the early 1950s, when Americans were exhausted by the stalemated war in Korea, by arguing that the real communist threat could be vanquished cheaply and nonviolently by ferreting out traitors at home. Gaffney argues something similar. “We can kill as many semi-literate bad guys as possible in the world's most hellish backwaters,” they declared in 2012, “but as long as we ignore, or worse yet, empower and submit, to the toxic ideology they share with highly educated and well spoken Islamists in this country and elsewhere, we are doomed to defeat.”
Over the last decade, conservatives disillusioned by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and alienated from their party's interventionist elite, have found in Gaffney's theories an appealing alternative. A key ally in that disseminating that alternative has been Breitbart. In March 2013, with Gaffney barred from speaking at CPAC, Breitbart hosted a series of panels called “The Uninvited” in the same hotel where the conference was being held. Steve Bannon moderated. The panels featured Gaffney and Pamela Geller, who had risen to prominence opposing New York's “Ground Zero Mosque.” They offered a platform to conservatives who argued that the greatest threat to American security lay not in jihadist terrorism abroad but in Muslim subversion inside the United States.
The following spring, Breitbart sponsored “The Uninvited II: The National Security Action Summit.” Bannon offered welcoming remarks; Gaffney moderated. That fall, Bannon and Gaffney co-hosted yet another set of panels, entitled National Security Action Summit II. Since then, Breitbart has become Gaffney's largest media megaphone. When The Washington Times cancelled their column, Breitbart picked it up. And Bannon interviewed Gaffney on their Breitbart radio show 29 times. Bannon has also echoed Gaffney's core thesis: calling Islam “a political ideology,” likening Sharia to “Nazism, fascism, and communism,” and describing the Muslim Brotherhood as part of “a fifth column in this country.” On Bannon's radio show in November 2015, Geller declared that, “Any mosque that advances, promotes, jihad must be shut.” Bannon replied: “Sedition, absolutely.”
If Breitbart was the first key institution to propagate Gaffney's theories, Act for America was the second. Led by a Lebanese-born Christian named Brigitte Gabriel, ACT didn't have a single paid employee in 2004. By 2016, it claimed 300,000 members and budget of more than $1 million.
ACT's agenda closely parallels Gaffney's. It uses the specter of the Muslim Brotherhood and Sharia law to depict American Muslim political participation, and even religious expression, as a security threat. ACT tries to ban the use of Sharia in American courts. It seeks to prevent the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) from lobbying state legislatures. It tries to remove from textbooks any references that equate Islam with Judaism and Christianity. It urges Jewish and Christian groups to eschew interfaith dialogue with Muslims. In the name of stopping Sharia, it even opposes the sale of Halal food. In 2007, a questioner asked Gabriel, “Should we resist Muslims who want to seek political office in this nation?” They replied, “Absolutely. If a Muslim who has—who is — a practicing Muslim who believes the word of the Koran to be the word of Allah … this practicing Muslim, who believes in the teachings of the Koran, cannot be a loyal citizen to the United States of America.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn.--A former Outback Steakhouse International executive is bringing a new craft beer concept called Growler USA to Nashville.
Announced on Businesswire Tuesday, the microbrew pub features 100 taps of regional craft beers, tap wines, hard ciders, food, and even cold-pressed coffee. Denver-based Growler USA plans to open Music City's first location next year, the first in Tennessee.
Growler USA plans to open eight locations around Nashville, taking advantage of the city's rapid growth. Former Outback Steakhouse International executive and current Growler USA lead principal Greg Walther says the pub's focus is on embracing "greater variety and more choice...I'm excited to join the Growler USA family and look forward to opening our doors in Nashville.”
The Nashville locations will join locations in North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, and Texas. Phoenix, Denver, and Tulsa are other cities which are expected to open by the end of the year.
At world's end: Artists reveal stunning post-apocalyptic images of cities around the globe

From New York City to Beijing, a team of artists is shedding light on what the world would be like at the end of humanity.
In Silent World, artists Lucie and Simon have taken the world's most familiar and populous cities and removed all but one or two people to create the illusion of a lonely world.
In the thought-provoking work, places like the normally bustling Times Square and Tiananmen Square appear absent of their crowds.

Times scare: New York's normally bustling crossroads of the world is missing all but one person in this Lucie and Simon photograph
Desolate: Paris' Place de la Concorde is shown without vehicles or people as the Eiffel Tower rises in the background
Empty: Locations like the Beijing railway station would normally be packed with commuters, but not in an imaginative post-apocalyptic world

argo design envisions the hyperloop travel experience
the hyperloop is a conceptual high speed transportation system put forward by spaceX and tesla motors founder elon musk, that incorporates tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. mr. musk released the idea to the public in August 2013, in a 57 page document for others to further evolve the ‘hyperloop'. through spaceX, the entrepreneur plans to construct a test track in texas to accelerate development of a functional prototype.
with that argo design released a series of conceptual renderings to show what the ‘hyperloop' terminals, platforms, capsules and capsule interiors would look like to the public.

‘from trains to cars to airplanes, there's always been a certain romance associated with modern travel,' describes mark rolston, founder and chief creative officer at argo design. ‘we wanted to explore how the hyperloop could take shape as a delightful and memorable experience for travelers.' the creative concepts contain four removable capsules for carrying passengers, vehicles and cargo. when ready, the capsules are fastened to the ‘hyperloop' sled.
the executive meeting capsule
they incorporate a multi platform layout that allows for specific cargo types, for example, one platform for passengers and a lower one for maintenance and loading of vehicles. each capsule would be assembled in a line, using a lift between platforms. there would be five types of capsules: vehicle, cargo, executive meeting capsule, business work capsule, and a coach capsule.

designer chipp walters explains, ‘after studying both the initial plans and the engineering assessments we realized it would be critical for our design to expedite the exchange of passengers, vehicles, and cargo. to that end, we developed the concept of a capsule jukebox, which would lift capsules off the hyperloop sled and onto the departure/arrival platform. there they could be changed, configured, loaded, and unloaded. a second platform would be used for maintenance and loading of vehicles.' argo design's blueprints of the ‘hyperloop' spark a creative conversation about what the future of mass public transportation could look like, and the direction it should take.

[Update: We have finally published the complete report about OpenStack Folsom. Although the details mentioned here are still relevant, the numbers are much more complete and accurate in that final report.]
OpenStack is expected to release their next major version, codenamed Folsom, in a few days. To prepare for that release, we at Bitergia have performed an analysis on the development repositories of Folsom core projects (those that appear as “core projects” in the OpenStack Projects webpage plus the OpenStack Manuals project) with the aim of better understanding their release cycle since the last major release, back in early April. While we work on the final analysis, timed to get out when the new release is ready, you can have a look at a general preview of it, updated as of today.
Let's start with some numbers. According to our data, during the five months and a half since the Essex release, the eight core projects composing OpenStack have been changed more than 3,400 times (number of commits), with those changes affecting more than 5,000 different files. These changes have been performed mostly by a core group of 62 developers, with a total of 283 developers making changes during this period. Those developers belong to 46 different companies.
Entering into details, we have structured the study in several sections: a general analysis of changes to source code and tickets, a per-project analysis, and a per-company analysis, complemented by a general summary. The study includes the evolution of several parameters (commits, developers, tickets open & closed, files touched, etc.) over the analyzed period. Most evolution charts are presenting metrics per week.
The rest of this post comments some of the data shown. You can have a look at it, and / or go straight to the full preview of the report. You can also have a look at our previous post, How companies are contributing to OpenStack, which showed some preliminary results, and explained a bit the methodology for the companies analysis. And stay tuned, our final report will be released when Folson is released…
The general overview page shows the general activity during the preparation of Folsom. Commits (times the code was changed), committers (developers) and files touched per week are good proxies to know about the activity of a project. In this case, we can see a general increase in activity as time passes and release time approaches. In the case of files touched, peaks in April and August are interesting: during those weeks, about 1,000 files were touched, compared to about 400-600 for most of the period. That usually means a lot of longitudinal activity (that spread over large areas of the project).
Movements in they issue tracking system (the ticketing system) are telling about activity as well. Ticket opening (which is usually more related to the community of engaged users) is somewhat uniform during the period, except for a clear fall during late June and early July. But ticket closing is different, with a general upward trend, and clear peaks of activity. This is usually more related to the reactive activity of the community of developers, and in this case shows (except for the peaks) a trend similar to that of changes in the source repository.
From another point of view, the analysis of tickets open and closed by project shows another angle of the inner life of OpenStack. For all projects, there are more tickets open than closed, but not all of them are equal. Nova is clearly getting much more attention (in terms both of openings and closings) than the rest of components.
The analysis of the activity by company shows, to some exstent, a picture of how they are contributing to make OpenStack real. Of course, commits (or committers / developers) offer only one perspective of contributions (a company may contribute in many other ways, and commits are by no means a uniform metric), but it can provide a first idea of how companies are behaving.
In this chart, which is a summary for this commit-based activity, not only the number of commits and committers is relevant. The relationship between both is also telling a story: as a general rule, the higher the ratio of commits to committers, the more intense the activity of those committers is (at least with respect of changes to the code). Of course, many factors affect the number of commits by committers, starting by personal preference on how to commit changes. But other things being equal, the number of commits and committers is telling, for example, whether a company has a small team of people focused in the project, or a large group with shallower participation.
[For more information about how to interpret the charts for companies, please refer to How companies are contributing to OpenStack (although for the data, the sutdy we're presenting here is more accurate)]
The section on projects show the different patterns and intensity of their corresponding activity. To begin with, it is important to notice that scales in the Y axis are absolute, of different magnitude. For example, the Nova project, above, has a graph for commits with a peak of about 200 commits per week,while the Keystone project has no more than 30 per week. The shape of the curves, the weeks where they have peaks or falls, etc. are telling how those projects have been developed, how many people have been contributing to them, and when, etc.
In summary, free / open source software projects, and specially those having large communities like OpenStack, are complex entities with their own life. And there are may facet to take into account when trying to understand them. We hope to shed some light (and numbers), that help to better track and improve what's happening. Because you know, you cannot improve what you cannot measure…
[Final note: All the numbers included in this study could still have some errors, but they have already gone through a number of validations, and are correct to our best knowledge. This said, remember you can always download the datasets and do a parallel analysis, if you're interested. We have analyzed only the projects considered as core projects in the OpenStack Projects webpage: that means that activity (and people and companies) working in other parts of OpenStack, such as libraries, are not considered in this study.]

WEST PEORIA — A couple of entries in West Peoria's Fourth of July parade that depicted various versions of President Donald Trump — including one of the president in a flesh-colored bodysuit seated on a golden toilet — sparked a deluge of angry calls to City Hall on Wednesday. The entries prompted city officials to apologize for the procedural lapse that allowed the floats into the popular patriotic parade that draws thousands of spectators.
"It has been a bad day," said office assistant Pam Zych, the city employee who fielded the barrage of calls on Wednesday from angry Trump supporters and others who thought the entries were inappropriate.
The first entry was a Cadillac convertible with two people in the back seat impersonating Donald and first lady Melania Trump. Zych said that entry angered callers who thought it was in poor taste because it evoked the image of the assassination of President Kennedy in the Dallas motorcade in 1963. The Melania actor wore a pink pillbox hat, a historic icon that closely identifies with Jackie Kennedy, not the current First Lady.
West Peoria resident Nick Baker owned up to the Cadillac entry.
"It was just a couple of goofballs having fun in a parade," Baker said Wednesday. "I am not a political activist by any means. It was not our intent to present a serious message."
The entry behind the convertible was more provocative. It included a group of Trump-dressed men raising an American flag meant to recreate the famous photo of American soldiers raising the flag on the island of Iwo Jima in World War II. It contained two women in a cage wearing cat ears next to a sign that read, "Grab that pussycat. Build that wall," a reference to the infamous Trump video where they profanely describe inappropriate behavior toward women. A Trump mannequin sat in a bathtub full of money. And on the back of the float was an implied naked masked-Trump seated on a gold toilet holding a cell phone and presumable crafting their next tweet on Twitter. The toilet paper holder on the float contains images of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, in an apparent equal-opportunity message across political boundaries.
Although city records show otherwise, Baker did not take responsibility for the second entry.
Mark Wrhel, the owner of West Peoria's Haddad's Grocery, and the parade's lead organizer until two years ago when the city took over its coordination, helped line up entries before the parade on Tuesday.
"When I saw the Trump entries, my first thought was 'What is this'? Whrel said. "I was super uncomfortable with it, but didn't know what to do. Nobody told us we had the authority to pull an entry out of the parade. What is worst is that (Zych) bore the brunt of all the anger when they had done such great work on the parade for months. They were blindsided by all the anger when they literally had nothing to do with it. I understand the argument for First Amendment protection of expression, but I feel bad I let (the Trump entries) go down the road. (The parade volunteers) didn't know what to say or do."
City Administrator Kinga Krider said the city believes it was deceived by the applicant for the entry.
"We were misled from the beginning when we were told the entry was of a presidential motorcade with Secret Service agents and that is all," Krider said Wednesday. "We work hard to make this a family friendly event and not to include anything that would have to be explained to children afterward.We will make the necessary changes to make it harder for something like this to every happen again."
Mayor Jim Dillon said the Trump entries spoiled a well-run and fun-filled event.
"I was at the front of the parade pushing my 6-month-old granddaughter, which was the thrill of my life," Dillon said Wednesday. "Then all this happened and threw some egg on the city's face."
The parade has inadvertently offended others in the past. A Prisoner of War float with a shackled man in a cage upset some enough that it was banned for a couple of years, but returned this year. Opponents of abortion rights handed out little plastic fetuses in the past. A float last year showed a Hillary Clinton impersonator behind bars and in handcuffs.

If you were to make a list of the problems with religion, topping that list might be its involvement in wars, both real and cultural. Religion can be used as a weapon to marginalize different groups of people (like the LGBT community) and we've all seen the physical destruction devout faith can cause in different parts of the world.
So if you wanted to convince people to come to your church, using a war metaphor would be a pretty horrible way to do it.
But that's what Fellowship Church Pastor Ed Young has done. The man who owns a personal jet and asked their congregation to give them direct access to their bank accounts created a movie trailer for their recent sermon series making the connection between God and a weapon of war:
Yep, God is a drone. Because they both watch over you… and they both have the ability to ruin the lives of innocent people.
(I've heard of drones in church, but they're usually the ones speaking. *Cue rim shot*)
… the drone metaphor is a terrible and disturbing one. It trivializes the big questions about a scary new technology and equates God with a weapon of war. … We asked Young about their choice of metaphors. They explained that they were following Jesus' example. Young explained that Jesus made use of cultural icons their culture could connect with to strengthen their sermons. “We do the same thing,” Young said. “We try to use things that our culture can identify with.” Young also claimed they never thought of Drones as scary. “I hadn't really thought about it being ominous but you probably have a good point.”
is rightfully disturbed by the connection
That didn't stop them from giving a month's worth of sermons about the connection — you can see the first one here. It's a loose connection at best and one that plays right into their critics' hands… but it's manly and powerful and that's pretty much catnip for someone like Young.
As someone who has (*ahem*) made unwise comparisons involving God before, I would urge Young to step back from this one.
At Warner Bros' global fan event for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them today, the studio made a big announcement: There will be five Fantastic Beasts films total, instead of the trilogy, as originally thought.
The Mary Sue and HitFix provided live updates, rounding up a couple of key points about the growing movie franchise:
Albus Dumbledore “features a little bit in a wonderful scene” between Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), according to director David Yates.
Gellert Grindelwald, Dumbledore's former friend (and object of their affection) turned dark wizard, will have a bigger part in these movies than previously expected: He's “sort of in the background [of Fantastic Beasts],” Yates says, “and he's going to become a much more prominent part of the stories going forward.”
After Newt Scamander presumably finds at least some of the fantastic beasts in the first movie, their journeys will take them to other capital cities. More from Yates: “We next see Newt in another big capitol city and it's not going to be New York, it's somewhere else entirely,” they said. “And Jo has actually written the script and it's just as magical and just as marvelous as the first one, but very different, which is so exciting for all of us.”
Amid rumors that there would be “at least” five films, Rowling confirmed on Twitter that they're stopping at five:
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them opens in theaters November 18.

The first priority of federal health officials is to protect Americans from Ebola, but "an outbreak anywhere is potentially a threat everywhere," the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Sunday.
In recent days, a handful of lawmakers, including Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, have called for restrictions on air travel between Ebola-affected countries in West Africa and the United States.
On Saturday, there was a brief scare at Newark Liberty International Airport when a passenger who had traveled from West Africa was ill on a flight from Brussels. A CDC official met the aircraft and the passenger was taken to a hospital, where "it became clear that the symptoms that individual had weren't consistent with Ebola,'' CDC Director Thomas Frieden said. The patient was discharged and was feeling better.
Despite the concerns sparked by such incidents, Frieden emphasized the importance of keeping the travel pipeline open to Ebola-stricken countries in order to fight the outbreak at its source.
"If we don't control the outbreak, there's a real risk that it could spread to other countries in Africa'' and beyond, Frieden said. "To do that, we need regular travel.''
"If we make it harder to fight Ebola in West Africa, we actually increase our own risk," they said. They noted that everyone leaving Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone is being screened and said the CDC is considering a plan to screen everyone coming into the U.S. from those countries.
CLOSE The Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas has taken a turn for the worse, according to health officials. VPC
"We've seen a lot of understandable concern because of the deadly nature of Ebola," Frieden said. "We want (people) to be scared. We want them to have a healthy respect."
Before Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed in Dallas, the CDC was getting 50 to 100 calls or e-mails daily. Now it's getting about 800.
Health officials traced Duncan's contacts since they arrived in Dallas and found no one exhibiting any symptoms, said David Lakey, Texas health commissioner.
"We are very happy about that, but very cautious," Lakey said. "We are on high alert right now."
Duncan was in critical condition in the intensive care unit in Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Frieden said they had taken "a turn for the worse."
In August, two Americans who had contracted Ebola while working in Africa recovered in the United States after receiving the experimental drug ZMapp. Duncan is not receiving the drug because there is none left.
"It takes a long time to make that medicine," Frieden said, "so it's not going to be available any time soon."

Hamilton claimed that Reading and Bournemouth were also interested in the former Accies youth player, who was due to be out of contract in the summer.
The move almost fell through after Hamilton vice-chairperson Ronnie McDonald criticised West Ham, however, David Sullivan has smoothed over negotiations.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle has signed Anthony Stokes on a free transfer and remains keen on adding former Sunderland forward Danny Graham.

As previously promised... we are releasing the average English vocabulary levels per-country, for non-native speakers. Please keep in mind, this is not scientific in the slightest, but rather just for fun.
First, the map and ranking:
It is clear that the real "winner" here is Northern Europe: the first four places are Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. After that, Europe as a whole has a relatively strong showing, along with Mexico, Argentina, Israel, Chile, and Indonesia.
But, what does this chart really mean? Besides being based normally on the vocabulary test results, there are three limits placed on the data:
Non-native. It is based on speakers self-identified as non-native speakers only, so an American living in China should not affect the data for China.
No English as an official language. We have not included results for countries where English is one of the official languages. This means no US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Philippines, or Singapore. While many of these countries had high numbers of respondents who self-identified as non-native English speakers, comparison with other countries would not be very meaningful.
At least 300 respondents. Less than this, and the data for the country is really not very meaningful at all. (Interestingly, China, Iran and Russia are by far our largest participants, with over 60,000 test-takers each. Next comes Ukraine at 23,000, and then Germany at 12,000.)
And then, there are two big caveats to keep in mind:
Internet participation. It is based only on people who took the survey, without any kind of scientific control, or guarantee that the participants are representative of the overall population as a whole. In fact, they almost surely aren't, since Internet users tend to be better educated and fall into particular age groups. Strictly speaking, this means the comparative data is totally useless, because it is theoretically possible that, for example, the test was popular among top students in Denmark, and among low-performing students in Iran. Such an extreme example is probably not the case, but whether participation in a particular country came via an article on a high-brow news site, or was spread by a particular group of people on a certain social network, could certainly have an influence.
IP addresses. Countries were calculated automatically from the IP addresses of test-takers. These are mostly accurate, but not perfect. Some respondents also provided their nationality in the survey. Many countries show self-reported nationalities and IP addresses matching up over 95% of the time, while other countries have a somewhat lower rate. So country identification, while good, is not absolutely perfect.
So have fun with the rankings, but don't take them too seriously. And if you have further interest, check out the EF English Proficiency Index, which shows very similar results which come from a completely different survey, and also has a PDF report with interesting profiles of English usage in a number of countries.
Oct. 4 Is President Monson's 50-Year Anniversary as Apostle
Contributed By By Gerry Avant, Church News editor
Article Highlights President Monson's 50-year anniversary as an Apostle is Oct. 4, 2013.
One of the things that has brought them the most joy was “feeling the nudge of the Lord, the promptings,” and responding to them.
Asked how they would like to be remembered, President Monson replied, “I tried my best.”
“I've always followed the philosophy, ‘Serve where you are called, not where you have been or where you might be. Serve where you are called.'” —President Thomas S. Monson

On Friday, October 4, 1963, Thomas S. Monson walked into the Tabernacle on Temple Square and looked for and found a seat on the main floor's north side of the building, fairly close to the front.
A photographer assigned to cover the 133rd Semiannual General Conference of the Church snapped what might well be the last photo of them as a “rank and file” member of the Church. Just moments after that picture was taken, 36-year-old Thomas S. Monson was sustained as the newest member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
Never since has they had to look for a seat at general conference; however, they have never completely removed themselves from the “rank and file” members. In the half century since being called as an Apostle, President Monson has never lost the desire to be among the members. They have loved shaking hands with them, giving them hugs, and talking to them wherever they have gone throughout the world.
Fifty years ago, at that semiannual general conference, they began their first address as a newly called General Authority with these words:
“Some years ago I stood at a pulpit and noticed a little sign that only the speaker could see, and the words on that sign were these: ‘Who stands at this pulpit, let them be humble.' How I pray to my Heavenly Father that I might never forget the lesson I learned that day!”
Though just 36 years old, the new Elder Monson was mature in Church leadership. Called at age 22 as a bishop, age 27 as a stake president's counselor, and age 31 as a mission president, they were already experienced in teaching and leading others and in listening to and being guided by the Spirit. Humility and compassion have guided them in all their ecclesiastical endeavors.
In their first general conference address, Elder Monson said:
“I think of a little sister, a French-Canadian sister, whose life was changed by the missionaries as their spirit was touched as they said good-bye to me and my wife two years ago in Quebec. They said, ‘President Monson, I may never see the prophet. I may never hear the prophet. But President, far better, now that I am a member of this Church, I can obey the prophet.'”
Thomas S. Monson is shown in the audience at the Tabernacle on Temple Square, moments before they were sustained as a General Authority and invited to the stand.
That French-Canadian sister had no way of knowing that they were speaking to a man who, just a couple of years later, would be called by a prophet, David O. McKay, to serve in the Quorum of the Twelve and in future years would become a prophet.
In their first address to the general membership of the Church, Elder Monson said: “My sincere prayer today, President McKay, is that I might always obey you and these, my brethren. I pledge my life, all that I may have. I will strive to the utmost of my ability to be what you would want me to be. I am grateful for the words of Jesus Christ, our Savior, when They said:
“‘I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him.'
“I earnestly pray, my brothers and sisters, that my life might merit this promise from our Savior.”
Elder Monson bore their testimony: “I know that God lives, my brothers and sisters. There is no question in my mind. I know that this is Their work, and I know that the sweetest experience in all this life is to feel Their promptings as They direct us in the furtherance of Their work. I have felt these promptings as a young bishop, guided to the homes where there was spiritual, or perhaps temporal, want. I felt it again in the mission field as I worked with your sons and your daughters —the missionaries of this great Church who are a living witness and testimony in the world that this work is divine and that we are led by a prophet.”
During an interview several years ago, the Church News asked President Monson to describe what it had been like to be called as an Apostle of the Lord. They did not answer that inquiry directly but spoke of “being called of God” in more general terms. They spoke of being called as a bishop at age 22 to serve in a ward of 1,080, more than 80 of whom were widows. They said, “I had a heavy responsibility for welfare, and I might mention that our family was a pioneer family in that ward. About a third of the ward was represented by old-time families and two-thirds by a transient population. Why I was selected, I can't tell you. Only the Lord would know that. I had the opportunity to serve for five years as bishop of that large ward. I would say it was one of the most productive periods of my life” (Gerry Avant, interview notes, Aug. 1997).
After the death of President Gordon B. Hinckley on January 27, 2008, President Monson was ordained and set apart as President of the Church on February 3, 2008.
Shortly before they were to be sustained by the membership of the Church in a solemn assembly during the April 2008 general conference, the Church News asked President Monson if they could describe their thoughts and feelings pertaining to the moment they realized they were going to be the next President of the Church. Again, President Monson gave an answer that could be understood by just about anyone who serves in the Church: “I've always followed the philosophy ‘Serve where you are called, not where you have been or where you might be. Serve where you are called.'
“I did that as a bishop, as a stake presidency member, as a mission president, and as an Apostle. I've never speculated on what might lie ahead for me. I just never did. I didn't know but what President Hinckley would outlive me” (Church News, Apr. 5, 2008).
Throughout their life, and particularly during their 50 years as a General Authority, President Monson has served where they have been called. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, they supervised the missions of the Church in the western United States, the South Pacific, Mexico, Central America, and Europe. After a number of years and following the policy of rotation, the European missions were transferred to another member of the Twelve; however, Elder Monson retained responsibility for all countries behind the Iron Curtain. They were instrumental in the construction of the Freiberg Germany Temple, served as chairperson of the Scriptures Publication Committee, and supervised the process that resulted in the new editions of the standard works of the Church.
They served as a counselor to three Church Presidents; they were called in 1985 as Second Counselor to President Ezra Taft Benson, in 1994 as Second Counselor to President Howard W. Hunter, and in 1995 as First Counselor to President Gordon B. Hinckley.
During a conversation with the Church News prior to their 70th birthday (see Church News, Aug. 23, 1997), President Monson said that one of the things that had brought them the most joy was “feeling the nudge of the Lord, the promptings. When you respond to them, you discover that in a way you're answering someone's prayer.”
They gave as an example an experience he'd had several years earlier as they were leaving a hospital after visiting their father. They were rushing to get to an 8:00 a.m. meeting. “I was in a hurry, but I just couldn't take that elevator when its doors opened,” they said. “I wondered, ‘What am I to do?'
“A lady came out of a room and asked, ‘Do you have a minute?' I didn't have a second. But their appeal was so tender that I said, ‘Sure.' I went into the room. There was a dear woman who was having a hard time leaving this earth. The family was all assembled, crying. They said, ‘Will you give Mother a blessing and ask Heavenly Father if it is their time that their wish might be granted, or if it isn't that their health might be restored?' Them son and I administered to the woman. Later, when I returned to my office, I received word that each one of the children kissed the mother and said good-bye. Then they slipped away. I didn't know any of them when I went into that room, but I knew then why I couldn't get on that elevator.
“I've had that happen to me all through my life to the extent that I try to keep the antennae up and have no interference so there is clear communication. When I'm the recipient of that kind of blessing, I think of the little couplet, ‘God's sweetest blessings always go by hands that serve Him here below' (“Living What We Pray For,” by Whitney Montgomery).
“You develop an appreciation that Heavenly Father knows who you are. And They say, ‘Here, go do this for me.' I always thank Him. My only regret is that I don't have more time to do the many things we are called upon to do. I work hard. I work long. I hope I work effectively, but I never feel I have exhausted what I should be doing. … I believe we have a responsibility to be a good influence on others.”
Asked how they would like to be remembered, President Monson replied with a brief phrase that aptly captures the essence of their life and ministry: “I tried my best.”
A stockman musters cattle on motorbike in the Simpson Desert on the border of the NT, Qld and SA. A study has found global warming will cause Australian deserts to expand further south.
A United States climate study says global warming will cause Australian deserts to get bigger and expand to the south.
The study's lead researcher William Lau, of the University of Maryland, said changes in atmospheric circulation was contributing to global dryness, in terms of a reduction of relative humidity in the sub tropics.
Dr Lau said they believed the changes were directly related to prolonged droughts.
"We provide a physical basis for inferring that greenhouse warming is likely to have contributed to the observed prolonged droughts worldwide in recent decades," they said.
The research was published this week in the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.
Dr Lau's study looked at the Hadley cell, which moves warm air away from the tropics, and found a strengthening of the cell manifested in a "deep tropics squeeze" leading to increased frequency of dry events in particular latitudes.
"What we found is that any region in the sub tropics that has a desert region, they have a semi-arid region, those climatologically are the zones of sinking air motion," they said.
"What we've found is sinking air motion is actually expanding, so all those areas at the edge of the deserts, are being expanded, that's why Australia is affected in that way.
"In addition, regions within the tropics ... they actually lose moisture, because moisture is being transported into the heavy precipitation region, at the expense of the neighbouring region which actually gets moisture divergence, so Australia it has its own desert, it has its own sub-tropical dry zone and that area is part of that global drying pattern that we see in the model."
Martha Rendell (10 August 1871 – 6 October 1909) was the last woman to be hanged in Western Australia. They were convicted of murdering their de facto husband's son, Arthur Morris, in 1908. They were also suspected of killing their two daughters, Annie and Olive, by swabbing their throats with hydrochloric acid. Although the children died slow and agonising deaths, they had been treated by a number of doctors during their illness, only one of whom expressed any doubts about their deaths.
Beginnings [ edit ]
Martha Rendell moved in with Thomas Nicholls Morris at 23 Robertson St, East Perth after they had separated from their wife, who had moved out and lived elsewhere.[1] Morris had custody of their four children at the time. Rendell, who had known Morris whilst in Adelaide and had followed them west, moved into the house and posed as their wife. The children were told to call them "mother".[2]
Rendell brutally abused Morris' children, once beating Annie so savagely that they could not walk. Arresting officer Inspector Harry Mann said "she delighted in seeing their victims writhe in agony, and from it derived sexual satisfaction".
Crimes committed [ edit ]
Rendell killed 7-year-old Annie first. Them method was to put something in the child's food that would result in a sore throat. It was alleged that they killed the children by swabbing hydrochloric acid on the backs of their throats, claiming it was medicine. This would inflame the throat until the child could no longer eat, and thus would starve to death. Annie died on 28 July 1907. Dr. Cuthbert issued a certificate stating the cause of death was diphtheria.
After killing Annie, they turned their attention to Olive, aged 5. Olive died on 6 October 1907, and again Cuthbert issued a certificate stating the cause of death was diphtheria.
In the winter of 1908 Rendell tried the same method on Arthur, the third son and youngest child still alive. Arthur, who was 14, took longer to succumb to the treatment, finally dying on 6 October 1908. Cuthbert asked permission for an autopsy. Rendell said they wanted to be present during the investigation. They stood by as the autopsy was performed, and the doctors found nothing to incriminate her.[2]
In April 1909, they turned their attention to the second son, George. It didn't take long for the second son to complain of a sore throat after drinking a cup of tea. Rendell coated their tonsils with the syrup, frightening the boy, who ran to their mother's place some streets away. Neighbours enquired as to the boy's whereabouts; however, their father Thomas Morris stated that they did not know.[2]
Investigation and trial [ edit ]
Neighbours went to the police, and inspector Harry Mann conducted inquiries. Mann heard repeated references to the children's having their throats painted, and Rendell's apparent indifference to their pain. One neighbour claimed they often peeked in the windows to see Rendell standing in front of the screaming victim, rocking back and forth as if in ecstasy. Some also claimed to have witnessed their masturbating.[citation needed] Mann located George Morris, who had claimed to have run away because their stepmother had killed their siblings and was trying to poison them with spirits of salts (i.e. hydrochloric acid).[2]
The inquiry was hampered by the period of time that had elapsed since the deaths, and because doctors could not say what effect swabbing with spirits of salts would have. Suspicions were further aroused when it was shown that Rendell had purchased large quantities of spirits of salts during the period of the children's illnesses, but none since the last death. Armed with this information the detectives obtained permission to exhume the bodies and this was done on 3 July 1909. Police exhumed the bodies of the three children; diluted hydrochloric acid was found on the throat tissue.[2]
Rendell and Thomas Morris were both charged with murder, the former being sentenced to death by hanging. Rendell protested their innocence, maintaining that they were treating the children for diphtheria. Although Thomas Morris was also charged with the murders, they were acquitted; it was believed that, although they had purchased spirits of salts, they had not been aware of the crimes until after the children's deaths. The jury wanted to find them guilty of being an accessory after the fact, but this was not allowed.[2]
Execution [ edit ]
The window with "Rendell's" image
Rendell's crimes aroused considerable public outrage at the time; the press portrayed them as a "scarlet woman" and "wicked stepmother". They were hanged at Fremantle Prison on 6 October 1909.  They are buried at Fremantle Cemetery, in the same grave where serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke was interred more than half a century later. Martha Rendell was the last woman executed in the state of Western Australia.
An illusion appears on one of the prison windows which can only be seen on the outside of the window; when inside the church looking out the glass is smooth and even, with no unusual shape or texture. An example of pareidolia, urban legend has it that this illusion is the portrait of Rendell, who watches over the prison.
In popular culture [ edit ]
The crimes of Martha Rendell were featured in an episode of the true crime TV series Deadly Women entitled "Pleasure From Pain" Season 5, Episode 14.

Just when you thought it was over, the temperature at reactor number 2 at Fukushima's nuclear plant has soared 26.7 degrees Celsius in the last few hours. Worse: they don't know why the temperature is increasing after being stabilized for so long.

The reactor reached 164 degrees Fahrenheit (73.3 degrees Celsius) after being stabilized at 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius) since last December. Here's the latest official update by Tepco, the owner of the plant:
At this moment, temperature indicates approx. 71.0 °C (as of 11:00 am on February 6). We will monitor it continuously.
The reactors were finally shut down cold after ten months of dramatic struggle by company and emergency workers.

Tepco has admitted that they don't have a clue about what is going on. They have increased the amount of water pumped into the reactor ten percent, but their technicians don't know what is going on. The change was detected in one of the three thermometers at the base of the reactor.
The plant was hit by a magnitude 9 earthquake and a tsunami that caused all systems to shut down, sending the reactors and spent nuclear fuel rods into a disastrous spiral of malfunctions that ended in a meltdown and venting of radioactivity material to the water and the atmosphere.
Helicopters have started to survey the area above the plant to gather information about the current radiation level in the air. [Tepco, Tepco, Tepco via Europa Press]

AppNexus, a major advertising technology provider, has barred Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules.
AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart's website after president-elect Donald Trump tapped Steve Bannon, former executive chairperson of Breitbart, to be White House chief strategist last week. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, said AppNexus spokesperson Joshua Zeitz.
"We did a human audit of Breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line, using either coded or overt language," they said.
The move comes while the two largest digital ad sellers, Alphabet's Google and Facebook, grapple with the rise of fake news -- misleading or intentionally deceptive articles that appear in social news feeds and online search results. Last week, both companies said they would pull advertising support from sites that spread "misinformation."
The AppNexus case is different. Mr. Zeitz stressed that the publication is not being targeted for its editorial position or for spreading misinformation. "This blacklist was solely about hate speech violation," they said. Other ad tech firms are sticking with Breitbart.
Breitbart doesn't buy ads directly using AppNexus. However, the publication shows ads bought through multiple automated online ad networks. Now that Breitbart is barred, it won't get ads from the network that AppNexus runs. It's unclear how much of a financial impact this may have, but it could lower the price of ads on Breitbart because there will be less supply. Alexandra Preate, a Breitbart representative, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
AppNexus, backed by large companies like Microsoft, News Corp. and WPP, is an important source of ad dollars for many online publications. The company was second to Google in the automated ad serving market for publishers, earning $2.1 billion in revenue in 2014, and paying $1.9 billion of that to publishers, Cowen & Co. has estimated. AppNexus executive Jonathan Hsu said in February the company handles about $2.5 billion in ad spending. Some of that went to Breitbart.com until now, Mr. Zeitz said.
The move underscores the predicament technology companies face trying to police editorial content without limiting free speech. Google and Facebook have banned content over hate speech, yet they move carefully when it comes to publications with a political bent. Twitter recently purged right-wing users, including a prominent Breitbart writer, for violating its terms of service. Facebook was criticized when conservative websites struggled to access its popular "trending news" section.
Breitbart is another vexing case. It is popular, with 19 million unique monthly visitors in October, up from 12.9 million a year ago, according to ComScore. The online publication has been criticized for incendiary articles, such as one that warns of "Muslim invaders" and another that dubs conservative thinker Bill Kristol a "Renegade Jew." One headline offered this fix for online harassment: "women should log off."
Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that Breitbart was "just a publication" that covers stories like other news organizations, according to tweets from New York Times reporters during an interview with the in-coming president.
Google's DoubleClick service, the leader in digital display advertising, still powers ads on Breitbart's website. That's despite Google rules barring its ads from running next to "harassing or bullying content" and "content that incites or advocates for harm against an individual or group." A spokesperson for Google declined to comment.
Other ad tech companies whose networks work with Breitbart defended their partnerships as evidence of the web's openness. Ad firm OpenX is "proud to support a free and vibrant internet," said spokesperson Lekha Rao.
"We do not make it our business to police editorial content," said Jeffrey Hirsch, Chief Marketing Officer for Pubmatic, which offers tracking tools that appear on Breitbart.com.
AppNexus, however, frames its decision as maintaining standards for the marketers whose ads run next to Breitbart's headlines. "We would ban this as quickly as a site that has pornography and violence," said Zeitz.

Top House Democrats on Friday rose in opposition to a bipartisan Senate bill that would end furloughs of air traffic controllers caused by sequestration, arguing that it unfairly left in place budget cuts across all other domestic and defense programs.
“I will oppose this bill because it fails to address the whole impact of sequester,” Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (MD) said on the floor. “Let me share just a handful of examples of how the sequester will affect Americans. Education, Head Start, 70,000 children will be kicked out of Head Start. Nothing in this bill deals with them. Furloughs to cause delays in processing retirement for disability claims, nothing in this bill deals with them. Four million fewer Meals on Wheels for seniors…Emergency unemployment insurance cut 11% for two million out-of-work Americans. Nothing in here for them.”
They added: “We ought not to be mitigating the sequester's effect on just one segment, when children, the sick, our military and many other groups who will be impacted by this irresponsible policy are left unhelped.”
The Senate voted unanimously Thursday night to advance the legislation in order to reopen control towers and “prevent reduced operations and staffing” at the Federal Aviation Administration by rerouting funds from other agency programs.
Though they ultimately voted for the bill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) seconded Hoyer's comments, calling on Republicans to address all sequestration cuts in conference with their Senate counterparts.
“Why don't you understand that there is a great deal at stake, including efficiency and the safety of our airports, but also, again, the education of our children,” they said.
The answer is: it doesn't matter. Plausible deniability is all anyone needs to make a lie, a deception, and even a war, in to a justifiable event. You could find a picture of McCain with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and a map of Iraq with an ISIS invasion plan of Iraq and it would make not an ounce of difference. The US and the West need their bad guys.What's more interesting is that Al-Baghdadi is the same guy that the United States held as a prisoner from 2005 to 2009. The same guy. According to, Al-Baghdadi is a quiet unassuming guy who seems like an unlikely person to lead this new bad guy called ISIS. The official story is that ““. Which seems to make little or no sense. Why would the Iraqi government support their release? Of interest is that while the Fox News story quoted above was published on June 13, 2014, three days later the exact quote was published verbatim on. Another web site to use the exact quote on Al-Baghdadi's release, called ISISthat “ISIS may have up to 6,000 fighters in Iraq and 3,000-5,000 in Syria, including perhaps 3,000 foreigners”. Which is actually about the size of one US military division.
The business strategy for Sony Online Entertainment's upcoming MMORPG, EverQuest Next Landmark has been outlined on their forums. While Sony has been struggling with layoffs as of late, its online entertainment business continues to shine, especially given the success of its newest console, the PS4. Dave Georgeson, director of development, defined the five phases of development for SOE's ambitious new title, as follows:
Phase 1: This is the “Founder's Pack” era of our game that we're in now. Everyone in Alpha bought a back-stage pass so that they could hang with the band and influence their music. That's what we're doing together now, and it has been amazing so far. Phase 2: We start selling stuff. Not a lot of stuff. Basically, just resources and character outfits. This phase will happen in the latter part of Alpha. Outfits are a no-brainer, and we've all seen this kind of offering in other games. Currently, our progression game is limited by resources, so selling those resources may seem like we're allowing you to pay for power. But our current game progression is not the intended real progression. Very soon, you'll only need handfuls of resources to make picks and other tools. Phase 3: An ongoing phase where, as we add features, we also add time shortcut methods as well. This phase will be ongoing, but you'll start seeing these features toward the end of Alpha. Phase 4: Launch Player Studio. At that point, all of our players can start submitting templates to the store and letting other players buy them. This should occur early during Closed Beta. Phase 5: Finally, at the end of Closed Beta, we add one more chunk of items. These are bigger-ticket items like cosmetic pets, sound/music packs for your claims, name/gender changes, extra claim flags, and more.
Georgeson went on further to say: “There will be additions/subtractions from this plan as we go, but we strongly believe that we can support the game well in these positive manners without compromising the game's balance, economy, or fun. After all, we're playing the same game that you're playing and we all want it to be fun.”
Landmark is currently in alpha testing and is expected to arrive sometime in 2015. Everquest: Landmark also aism to satisfy the needs and expectations of past Everquest fans, as well as bring in some new players to the popular franchise. It seems there are multiple MMORPGs to choose from in the coming future.
We all love baseball, or well most of you reading this must like it in some shape or form. It can be an action-packed game full of diving catches, close plays at home, walk-off home runs, dramatic game-ending strikeouts and many more exciting things. Baseball can also be a long game; and after adding in instant replay and manager challenges has made it even longer. According to Baseball Prospectus, in 2014 the average nine-inning Major League Baseball game has lasted three hours and 14 minutes. At one point or another, games will get so long that people will stop watching and going to them live. It's no secret that the MLB is trying to find a way to make the games shorter, but they don't necessarily need a new rule to make games faster. They actually already have one, they just need to enforce it.
If Major League Baseball needs a way to speed up the game, there is a rule they could enforce, and that rule is Rule 8.04. This rule is an official rule for pitchers in Major League Baseball, the definition is from MLB.com and it says
“When the bases are unoccupied, the pitcher shall deliver the ball to the batter within 12 seconds after they receive the ball. Each time the pitcher delays the game by violating this rule, the umpire shall call Ball. The 12-second timing starts when the pitcher is in possession of the ball and the batter is in the box, alert to the pitcher. The timing stops when the pitcher releases the ball. The intent of this rule is to avoid unnecessary delays. The umpire shall insist that the catcher return the ball promptly to the pitcher, and that the pitcher take their position on the rubber promptly. Obvious delay by the pitcher should instantly be penalized by the umpire.”
Think about every time you have watched a baseball game and seen the pitcher standing on the mound rejecting every sign the catcher gave them multiple times, or walking around the mound, taking their hat off and just taking their time to make the next pitch. It happens often and enforcing this rule would stop that kind of stuff dead in its tracks. Now 12 seconds doesn't sound long, but that's enough time to make a decision on what pitch you want to make.
To some people it might seem like a harsh rule, but take a look at this stat that Ted Berg, writer for USA Today, pointed out in one of their articles. The average time between pitches by a pitcher in 2014 is 23 seconds. Not only that, but according to Fangraphs.com in 2013 the three slowest pitchers in the league were Erik Bedard with a 25.9 pace (seconds between pitches), David Price with a 25.8 pace and Jeremy Hellickson with a 25.6 pace; while the fastest pitchers last year were R.A. Dickey with a 17.9 pace, Mark Buehrle at 18.1 and A.J Griffin at 18.3. There were only 15 out of 145 starting pitchers in 2013 with a pace under 20 seconds. That shows that a lot of starters simply take too long to throw their pitches.
So imagine forcing all the pitchers to pitch faster. The league could save so much more time and this rule would only be a factor to pitchers when no one is on base. I do understand that if the league enforced it a lot of pitchers could have a problem adjusting to a 12 second rule at the beginning, so maybe making it 15 seconds would at least help the players ease into the rule. It may also help with the league-wide decline on offense, as pitchers and catchers would have less time to scheme about pitch sequencing, and making the pitcher work faster would in all likelihood make them tire more quickly.
Baseball is a beautiful game. But with game times rising, and instant replay only further delaying games, baseball needs to make an adjustment. In this fast-paced world, people don't want to sit down for three consecutive hours; even if it is watching their favorite team. Making the pitchers pitch quicker would have positive effects on the length of baseball games and if Major League Baseball is serious about speeding up game play, this is a good place to start. They already have the rule, it's not like MLB would have to put it to a vote. All they have to do is enforce it.

Andrew Dykstra, 30, started two CONCACAF Champions League matches and the MLS opener. (USA Today Sports)
D.C. United has lost another goalkeeper to injury, leaving the MLS club without an experienced netminder two weeks into the season.
Andrew Dykstra, who was thrust into the starting role when Bill Hamid underwent knee surgery in January, will have an operation Friday for a herniated disk and miss 10 to 12 weeks, club officials said Wednesday.
With its top keepers sidelined, United will turn to Travis Worra, a second-year pro who made their first MLS start last Saturday, and Charlie Horton, a U.S. under-23 national team candidate who signed two weeks ago. General Manager Dave Kasper said the club has not ruled out acquiring help from MLS or abroad.
“Travis is coming off a terrific performance and has progressed very nicely since last year,” Kasper said. “We have full confidence in them stepping into the role. Charlie is getting sharper by the day.”
Worra, 22, handled themselves well but was not seriously tested in posting a shutout last weekend, a 0-0 result against the New England Revolution at Gillette Stadium. Their only other regular season appearance came last April as a second-half substitute at Vancouver. Most of their rookie season was spent with the third-division Richmond Kickers, United's USL affiliates.
Dykstra, an Osbourn Park High and Virginia Commonwealth University graduate in their fifth season with United, started both CONCACAF Champions League quarterfinal matches and the MLS opener at Los Angeles on March 6. Back spasms sidelined them in the middle of last week and prevented them from accompanying the team to Foxborough, Mass.
Dykstra, 30, saw a specialist Monday and underwent an MRI exam, which revealed the disk ailment.
“We really feel for Andrew,” Kasper said, “but we are confident in them making a full recovery.”
In 2014, Dykstra tore an Achilles' tendon late in the summer and missed the remainder of the season. As Hamid's back-up last year, Dykstra started nine regular season matches, as well as Champions League and U.S. Open Cup games.
Had Hamid and Dykstra remained healthy, Worra probably would have returned to Richmond this season. But Hamid's injury elevated Worra to No. 2 on the depth chart.
Hamid's injury also prompted United to sign Horton, 21, a former Leeds United prospect who has not played in a serious match since last November. Highly regarded in U.S. soccer circles, Horton left England last fall for family reasons and returned to Ohio.
Hamid was ruled out for four to six months and is on schedule to return as early as mid-May, Kasper said.
United (0-1-1) will make its regular season home debut Sunday against the Colorado Rapids (1-1-0). Kickoff at RFK Stadium is at 5 p.m. (ESPN2).
Evolutionary mismatch. This is the term that encompasses the root cause of most modern ills. We are living a lifestyle – read diet, stress level, movement and sunlight deficiency, toxic exposures, pharmaceuticals – that is incompatible with what our genome has evolved, over millions of years, to expect. Two specific points on the temporal chart – the Neolithic or agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution mark our wayward departure. For 99% of our existence, we consumed the so-called Paleolithic diet, notably devoid of inflammatory and “insulinotropic” foods like dairy, sugar, and grains. One of the primary victims of this shift has been the microbial ecology in our bodies – the 90% of our cells that are non-human in nature and that account for the majority of our epigenetic activities (production of nutrients including methylated folate, fatty acids, fat soluble vitamins including vitamin D Receptor expression, detoxification, immune signaling).
The Screen Door
Imbalanced flora is a causative factor in permeability of the blood/organ barrier. In the gut, this leads to increased blood levels of endotoxin (typically LPS). The role of diet in this process is elucidated in studies like this one which demonstrated:
Volunteers living for 1 month on a Western-style diet demonstrated, in a crossover study, a 71% increase in plasma levels of endotoxin activity (endotoxemia) when compared to those consuming what the authors called a prudent-style diet, who, in turn, demonstrated a 31% reduced level of endotoxin(s).
Specifically, many food components have the potential to activate inflammatory responses, and are referred to as “proteotoxins” including lectins, glutenoids (especially modern wheat with 15-20x the gluten of ancient varieties), and caseins (dairy). Heating of foods – grilling and broiling – can also produce advanced glycation end products and heterocyclic amines. Once these dietary compounds synergize, immune thresholds are lowered as white blood cells and chemokines are sensitized for response. “Leaky gut” or intestinal permeability has been implicated in multiple chronic diseases, including depression, and is thought to be largely triggered by gluten-induced zonulin activation which opens the spaces between intestinal cells.
Add to this mix pharmaceutical influence, and we've engaged an all out war on humanity. A fascinating review by Stig Bengmark MD describes the manifold adverse effects of common medications on the gut microbiome including antihypertensives (inducing oral dysbiosis), chemotherapy (inducing 100-fold increase in pathogenic bacteria like enterococci and a 10,000-fold decrease in anaerobes), and even antiretrovirals used in the setting of an HIV diagnosis. Antibiotics are, of course, notorious for their grenade-like effects. They state:
This is well demonstrated by the catastrophic changes induced on intestinal homeostasis by antibiotic treatment, according to a recent study, affecting over 87% of all metabolites detected, and deranging most metabolic pathways of critical importance to host physiology, including bile acid metabolism and eicosanoid and steroid hormone synthesis.
I encourage my patients to consider antibiotics for life or death health decisions, only, for this reason alone.
Meet the Residents
Who are these bugs we are so concerned about? The majority of enteric (gut) flora are “strict anaerobes”, classified as belonging to one of three types: Bacteroides, Prevotella, or Ruminococcus. Diet is a primary determinant of the nature of dominance within these sects. Bacteroides are more prevalent with long-term protein and animal fat diets where as Prevotella are associated with long-term carbohydrate diets. Comparisons between hunter-gatherer (Hadza), rural (Burkina Faso), and urban communities have yielded interesting differences, with a predominance of Firmicutes Gram-positive bacteria in traditional cultures relative to modern. The most recent study, in the Hadza tribe, is discussed here.
Efforts have been made to characterize the microbiota of regions other than the gut including the skin, oral cavity, vaginal canal, placenta (often characterized by an oral bacterium called Fusobacterium nucleatum!), but of course the looming question is, with a shrinking “core microbiome” thanks to modern day exposures, how will we know what is optimal?
Meet the Guests
Bengmark's review highlights the role of lactobacillus probiotics in reeducation of the gut microbiota. Of the strains that have been demonstrated to influence the immune system, species include L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii,L. fermentum, L. reuteri, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium animalis. The best studied for anti-inflammatory functions are: Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus.
The review suggests that specific strains may even have “pharmaceutical-like” effects:
L. acidophilus – antagonists of alpha-receptor activity, guanine antagonists, synthetic corticosteroids and flavonoids,
L casei – modulators of GABA receptors, cholinergic blockingagents, antagonists of beta-adrenergic receptors,
L. rhamnosus – glycoside steroids, alkaloids, protein synthesis inhibitors and protein kinase C inhibitors.
These strains are readily available in commercial products, and have an emerging role in psychiatric treatment.
Soil Based Probiotics
Synbiotics are probiotics that are packaged, simultaneously with their own food supply – resistant starch and fiber – called prebiotics. Through an evolutionary lens, these spore-forming probiotics, such as Bacillus genus, with fulvic acid prebiotic, make a lot of sense. There is data for the handful of products on the market, primarily in treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
Natural Harmony
Magnesium & Bacteria
The review also highlights the role of magnesium in intestinal integrity. I have written about the >300 reactions magnesium is involved in and its role in treatment of anxiety here. They state:
… subclinical hypomagnesemia is known to increase the severity of the systemic inflammatory response, worsen the systemic response to endotoxins, increase the levels and the effects of endotoxemia and increase insulin resistance, thereby promoting the development of the organ injuries commonly seen in critical illness but also in various chronic diseases.
Curcumin
Plant/spice modulators have similar anti-inflammatory effects, as I discuss, and Bengmark argues for first-line engagement of these “eco-biological” compounds and probiotics, not as adjuncts to medication but as replacements. I couldn't agree more.
As we elucidate the multitudinous functions we have outsourced to our coinhabitants, we will also witness the power of diet, movement, and stress management to influence the constituents. Hereinlies the power of a type of Functional Medicine, and of acknowleding the role of the microbiome – an entity that is completely unaccounted for in the current conventional model of care. It's time for conventional medicine to humble itself, and admit the limitations of a pharmaceutical-based model, before we compromise yet another generation's potential to harness optimal health and wellness.
In American comedic lore, the character Wile E. Coyote creates ridiculously complex contraptions to catch the Road Runner, but always fails. The Road Runner escapes, ironically, by superior wile. They run full speed, stops on a dime, and then—to the twinkling sharp keys of a piano—steps over the tripwire, smirks, and continues running.
The Coyote always returns to probe their contraption's failure and clumsily sets it off, throwing a boulder in their direction or casting themselves off a cliff. They try to survive by deploying a parasol, which is always ineffective against the boulder or gravity.
Hilarious. Never gets old, either.
In politics, Donald Trump is the Road Runner and their opponents are the Coyote. They fabricate increasingly complex contraptions to get Trump. They keep escaping, while they trip the wire meant for him.
The Billy Bush hot mic is a great example. Trump, in a bus qua locker room on the set of a soap opera, was getting ready to deliver the line “That's an interesting proposition…no” to a sexual advance made by one of the female characters.
The script involved powerful men and women who throw themselves at these men, and Trump confirmed to the chirpy extras on the dressing room bus that yes, it happens. It was, literally, locker room talk: a tale told in a place where men dress. They did not know they were being recorded and they used several coarse descriptors.
The Clinton campaign got hold of the tape and released it a few weeks before the election as a “confession” by Donald Trump that they assault women. It was not that. Nevertheless, the tape was widely reported as a confession because the dominant media has lost its mind.
Then Trump, being Trump, created a superior media spectacle by dragging three accusers of former President Clinton to their wife's next debate and sat them in the audience. It was probably the first time many younger than 30 heard that President Clinton had been credibly accused of harassment.
To the twinkle of the sharp keys, Trump stepped over the tripwire and sped away with their former Maxim model wife. The wily Democrats were left holding the stick of dynamite meant for them when it exploded. The aftershock has decimated Hollywood, PBS, the Ninth Circuit, Congress, 60 Minutes and the Today Show.
Then there were those excruciating post-mortems on the election, when the smart people tried to explain how Trump won Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia and Wisconsin: the Rust Belt. Voters in those states had always reflexively fallen for the class warfare stuff about the rich 1 percent being responsible for their horrible economic circumstances.
Republicans had stupidly run someone a composite police artist would sketch after interviewing middle Americans about what a rich person looks like. Yet they won. How?
The answer the erudite settled upon is that the simpletons had fallen for lies spewed at them over social media. “Fake news” is the word they coined. It was a mantra that rolled easily off the lips of David Gergen and Charlie Rose, and with months of constant repetition, would be the generally accepted reason for Trump's victory.
Except it rolled easily off the lips of Trump as well. Within days they wished they had never brought it up. They turned it right back on them. The Acme discrediting machine that was supposed to strap Trump to a rocket and send them into space had malfunctioned, and the wily resistance somehow found themselves in orbit, deploying a parasol.
When will the Coyote ever learn? Never, apparently. Which is alarming, because one of these ridiculous contraptions is going to do real damage.
Perhaps it was last week. This time it was Trump's partisans who had somehow managed to rig Alabama so that the Republican candidate for the Senate was a man twice removed from public office for disciplinary reasons.
The set-up was the brainchild of Trump's one-time chief strategist, Steve Bannon, miffed that the president had accepted the Senate majority leader's advice over theirs on a piddling matter of primary endorsement. They were going to show everyone who was boss by winning Alabama with a guy who said sodomy way more than anyone ever should, and rode a horse called “Sassy.”
Trump tried to avoid the dynamite by endorsing Luther Strange, but then dutifully held the fuse-lit Roy Moore stick when it was handed to him—and it exploded. That one caused some damage.
Then there is this Russian stuff, where Trump is also being done in by the wily brilliance of their own team.
Text messages released last week between a top FBI agent and their lover confirm that there was a law enforcement plan in place to disrupt Trump during the campaign as an “insurance policy” against their election.
The thing about insurance policies is that they come with an expiration date, and this one should have expired on January 20, 2017, the day Trump was inaugurated as the new sheriff in town. Except the people Trump appointed at the Justice Department were hoodwinked into continuing the baseless investigation.
Maybe baseless is the wrong word, because the existence of the investigation was itself the basis that it should continue, and anyone who said otherwise was obstructing justice.
Right now, that circular bit of sophistry is the greatest threat to the Trump presidency. Trump is still the Road Runner, gotta give them that, as long as their own people aren't setting the trap.

The town of Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines is located in the flatlands of the Pyrénées-Orientales about ten miles from the Mediterranean. It is home to the Abbaye Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines and its church, the Église Saint Michel. The abbey was founded in the 8th century by un homme pieux named Sentimir and dedicated to Saint Genis, a martyr of Arles who died in 303. We know that Sentimir planted vines and olive trees and built many buildings. The abbey was ransacked by Vikings in 981 and then rebuilt. The Église Saint Michel we see today dates from 981 and was enlarged and vaulted in 1153.
The Église Saint Michel has a simple cruciform structure of a nave with narrow transepts and a rounded apse. There is an echeloned chapel in each arm of the transept. The revaulting of the church required significant alteration of the structure in order to support the weight of the stone. As a result, there are no side aisles, only blind arcade arches. The vault is interesting, slightly ogive but supported by round Romanesque arches.
The apse is covered with an oven vault and is dominated by a beautiful 17th century retable.
The abbey church of Saint Michel is distinguished by possessing both the oldest dated Romanesque sculpture and one of the last expressions of Romanesque art in the south of France. The oldest is the carved lintel that adorns the otherwise plain and undistinguished west portal. We have done a fairly extensive review of this lintel in an article earlier.
As can be seen from the detail shot of Christ in Mandorla supported by two angels, this is a superb example of early Romanesque sculptural art.
The last expression of Romanesque art in the Rousillon was the beautiful marble cloister that dates from the third quarter of the 13th century. The cloister is unique for the composition of its materials. It is built from the different colored marbles – 99% pure white from Céret, pink from Conflent, and black from Corbières. The history of this cloister is as sad as that of its fellows at ‪Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert‬ and Saint Michel-de-Cuxa which were dismantled and parts of them found at the Cloisters Museum in New York. When the abbey at Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines was secularized during the French Revolution, the cloister was sold to various individuals.
In 1924 a Parisian art dealer, antiquarian and forger named Paul Gouvert attempted to buy it. Gouvert was famous for exporting antiquities to foreign countries and helped to install the Saint Michel de Cuxa cloister at New York's Cloister museum, to whom they also sold the chapter house of Notre Dame de Pontaut. Gouvert was not above doing business with those intent on pillaging the artistic treasure of their own country; they sold “the cloister of the Cistercian Abbey of Berdoues (Gers)” to Reichmarschall Hermann Goering and figures prominently on the “Art dealers involved in wartime trading in looted art in France” list. Gouvert's invoice for December 1940 for the dozens of works they sold to Goering totals over four million franks.
At the time of Gouvert's interest, three sisters had inherited the cloiser. Gouvert succeeded in acquiring the property of two of the sisters, leaving only a small portion in the southeast corner that the third sister refused to sell.
Deciding that it would be more profitable to sell two smaller cloisters instead of the single large one, Gouvert commissioned craftsmen to carve copies of twenty-three capitals in pink Conflent marble in the manner of Saint Génis sculpture. Three quarters of the original capitals and columns went to a banker named Nicolas Chrissoveloni at their Chateau du Mesnuls in Yvelines where it ornamented their sumptuous gardens.
Of the remaining elements, two arches and three columns were donated to the Louvre, while the original central fixtures and copies of the columns and capitals were sold to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Scholars think that only two of the capitals in Philadelphia are originals.
In the late 1970's, the town of Saint-Genis-des-Fontaines began a campaign to recover all the disparate elements and, after prolonged negotiations, succeeded in recovering the portions from the new Greek owner of the Chateau de Mesnuls and the Louvre. These were returned to their original location and joined to the fragment in the southeast corner. Thanks to the meticulous records and numbering system kept by Gouvert's craftsmen, the cloister was reconstructed in its entirety, with casts from the Philadelphia capitals to fill in the blanks. This is the cloister that we see today, which has survived by a miracle.
As for the portion of the cloister that remained in place, it had a history of its own. As recently as 1968, that small corner was incorporated into the home of a M. Joud and decorated their salon, kitchen, dining room and hallway!
In preparing this article, I spent a great deal of time researching Paul Gouvert. In particular the dozens of pages of invoices and details of the work that they sold to Goering for millions of francs over many years disturbed me greatly. I have heard all of the arguments why the sale of the artifacts to various museums benefited both the artworks and the museums, but the fact that the transactions were often conducted by people like Gouvert undermines the validity of that argument. The photocopies of their invoices list their address in Paris as 18-22 Rue Fourcroy in the 17th Arrondissement. Today that address is occupied by L'Atelier du Sourcil, a boutique devoted exclusively to the beauty of the eyebrow. I wonder if they realized just who their predecessor was, would they collectively would raise those beautified eyebrows?
But at the time we visited Saint Genis, we had no idea of these deeper undercurrents. PJ and I had a wonderful day, including enjoying a pichet of the local rosé at the café while we waited for the village to finish a parade down the streets of the town. The occasion? The Fête de la Saint Michel, patron saint of the church.
Note: the photo of the cloister incorporated into the house of M. Joud comes from “Le cloître de Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines (Pyrénées-Orientales). Historiographie” by Géraldine Mallet in Archéologie du Midi médiéval, 1987, Volume 5, Issue 5
The "crab" in the rocks and (inset) in close up
The picture, when blown up, shows a shape that even appears to have ten limbs like crabs on Earth.
In the shots taken by the NASA Mars Curiosity Rover it is seen appearing to lurk in a crevice among rocks on the Red Planet.
The rover, a remotely controlled four-wheel drive ground based space probe, is currently exploring the surface of Mars taking close up pictures and samples.
It is the latest in a long line of Earthly objects found by UFO researchers in close-up images beamed back by the Rover from Mars.
There have been pyramids, stone faces, ancient ruins, statues, and even a Martian Mount Rushmore in pictures posted by NASA online in recent weeks.
One viewer of the image on YouTube posted: "I find it odd that the surrounding rock looks nothing like the image in question, as well as the shape of the image, it really stands out from the other rocks around it in color and shape.
"It almost looks non natural, you would think that something else would stand out even if shaped differently, but it's the only rock that looks completely out of place."

It's a funny thing... I have a few AEKII boards and they don't all feel the same. I don't know if it's because they're old, or if they didn't have strict enough QC standards. Some definitely feel better than others.
@OPFor me, people just saying that clears are obviously perfect for that because they are so much heavier switches and will "stop" you from bottoming are incorrect. The bump is so unnoticeable to me that I even bottom THOSE out. I think I even use more force on those than my space invaders or any of my alps. Sounds like you might be doing something similar. I was going to suggest an AEKII or stealing the switches from one either by opening them and swapping contents with another not-silent board or soldering. If I cared about being quiet those are the only ones so far for me that is anything even close to that.Heck, my dad is using a browns board right now, just because of the NKRO of it and the fact that it is programmable (and has never programmed it, but then I have some of those too and haven't either). Anyway, I think they might be louder on it than the model m they were just previously using.Yeah, I'm not sure what is going on for that. One of the things I've noticed is that, so far for me anyway, the ones that look like they are truly cream colored are the ones that don't feel good. The ones that look stark white (they make the complicated whites look gray) do. I've only managed to get two that were stark white and unfortunately the first one was the best I'd used before and it got parted out.I'm quite interested in those new ones though, I just hope I don't find either the switches or the whole thing too expensive. I generally use older stuff, so that might be a lowish number to most here.
While Samsung took its Galaxy lineup in a new direction last year, LG moved its G Series along a well-traveled road. The LG G4 retained the same design language and features as the G3, and its upgraded cameras and new wide-gamut display were not enough to keep it from falling further behind other flagship devices. The G4 eventually veered into the upper mid-range lane, allowing LG's more luxurious V10 to pass by in the flagship express lane.
The G4's SoC was one of the components that limited its peak performance. After LG saw demand for its G Flex2 melt away after reports of overheating, it switched from using Qualcomm's octa-core 810 SoCs to the hexa-core Snapdragon 808 for the G4, which was at least less prone to thermal throttling; however, it failed to give the G4 a significant edge in performance or battery life over its predecessor.
Tired of moving along at a slower pace, LG decided to overhaul its G Series. The new G5 receives an aluminum body with a fresh coat of paint and the Snapdragon 820 SoC. Built around four of Qualcomm's custom-designed 64-bit Kryo CPU cores and a new Adreno 530 GPU, the 820 provides a performance boost over previous Snapdragon SoCs in specific workloads and is proving to be a popular choice for current generation phones.
Like Samsung's Galaxy S7, the G5 comes with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 32GB of UFS 2.0 NAND. LG does not offer any SKUs with more internal storage, so using the microSD slot is the only way to increase capacity. The G5 also adopts the new, reversible USB Type-C port (but only supports USB 2.0 transfer rates) and adds a second spatial stream to the 802.11ac Wi-Fi, elevating maximum theoretical bandwidth to 867Mb/s.

The G4's 8MP front-facing camera carries over to the G5, as does the 16MP Sony IMX234 rear camera, which resides in an upgraded module developed by LG Innotek. Sitting next to the 16MP primary rear camera, however, is a second 8MP camera with a wide-angle lens. Its 135° horizontal field of view—compared to 78° for the primary camera—allows you to capture more of your surroundings in each image, useful in large, open spaces or when taking group photos. There are drawbacks to using a wide-angle lens, though, which we'll cover more in-depth later when we evaluate camera performance.
The G5 also gains an always-on display feature similar to the Galaxy S7. LG first explored this idea with last year's V10, adding a small second screen above the large main screen. The G5's implementation is more conventional, doing away with the second screen and keeping only a subset of the V10's functionality. It shows the time centered near the top of the screen with the date below in a smaller font when the phone is asleep. Notifications show up as small icons below the date, informing you about new email or text messages without revealing any sensitive information. There's also an option to replace the time with a customized static message roughly twelve characters in length, which just seems silly.
An always-on display feature makes a lot of sense when using an OLED panel that only needs to power the few pixels actually in use. The G5 uses an LCD panel, however, which needs to power the backlight whether it's showing a single pixel or all of them. To reduce power consumption, LG is using a new LED driver IC that divides the backlight into two separate zones that can be powered on independently. Thus, only about the top one-third of the display is active when using the always-on feature. The G5's display also supports panel self-refresh, which helps save power when the screen's content is static. Based on LG's power figures, the always-on display should drain the battery by about 10% over a 12 hour period, which could be less than the amount used if you're constantly turning the display on to check the time or for new notifications. The G5 also uses the ambient light sensor to turn off the display when it senses it's in a pocket or purse or even when lying face down. The feature can also be disabled in the settings menu.
It seems like every smartphone has a fingerprint sensor nowadays, and the G5 is no exception. Integrated into the power button on the back of the phone, the new circular, touch-based sensor wakes up and unlocks the phone with a single press. Like other capacitive sensors, it does not handle moisture or changes in temperature well. I also experienced a higher rejection rate initially with the G5 than I did with the Nexus 6P because my finger did not always land on the sensor the same way. Registering the same finger in a few different positions improved performance, but the G5's experience was never as seamless or quick as some of the other devices I've used, including the 6P, iPhone 6s Plus, and Galaxy S7. On several occasions I had to punch in my pin code after locking out the fingerprint sensor with five failed attempts.
Herp Night puts alligators, lizards and other amphibians and reptiles in students' hands

It's not too often you can run into alligators in a classroom building at MSU.
But Wednesday night in the Natural Science Building, members of the MSU Herpetology Club gathered with snakes on their shoulders and lizards in their hands.
Every semester, Herp Night invites people of all ages to interact with reptiles and amphibians of all kinds, from frogs to tortoises to — you guessed it — alligators.
Zoology junior Kristin Keeler said the purpose of the Herpetology Club is simply to share knowledge about these reptiles and amphibians.
“It's a community on campus where people with reptiles and amphibians can come and show off their animals,” Keeler said.
Keeler said they enjoy getting the chance to teach people what it's like to own a reptile and how cool they can be.
“This event is mainly to educate the public and share our animals with people who normally wouldn't come into contact with them,” Keeler said.
Unfortunately, this common lack of contact results in widespread fear or a misunderstanding of reptiles and amphibians, Keeler said.
Forestry graduate student Danielle Miles said they hope Herp Night will reduce fear of these animals in the community.
“So many (reptiles and amphibians) are killed every year out of fear when they don't have to be,” Miles said.
Miles said they want these animals to be conserved and appreciated the way they and other members of the Herpetology Club appreciate them.
That is animal science senior Christian Plumm's favorite part — sharing them passion.
“I like that people get to see our pets and be a part of the things that we really enjoy,” Plumm said.
Many attendees who came to Herp Night didn't have to have a herpetology background to appreciate the myriad of reptiles and amphibians that greeted them.
Rachel Atchison, a research technician in the plant biology department, said they came to the event simply because there was a chameleon on the flier.
“I used to have a chameleon when I was younger, so that's why I was drawn to it,” Atchison said.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested 25 year-old Emanuel Lutchman for attempting a New Year's Eve terrorist plot in New York State in coordination with Daesh (Islamic State), the US Department of Justice announced in a press release on Thursday."The FBI thwarted Emanuel Lutchman's intent to kill civilians on New Year's Eve," Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Buffalo Division Adam Cohen said.According to the Justice Department, Lutchman received directions from Daesh to carry out an armed attack on civilians at a local bar and restaurant in upstate New York on New Year's Eve. The defendant also had plans to join the terrorist group overseas.The charges against Lutchman include attempting to provide material support to the Daesh terror group, outlawed in Russia and numerous other states.If convicted, Lutchman could face 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.The FBI and Department of Homeland Security have increased security preparations across the United States in light of recent Daesh-linked terrorist attacks. US media have reported that President Barack Obama was briefed on heightened terrorist threats in three major US cities over the New Year's holiday.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power directly confronted Syrian President Bashar Assad and their Russian and Iranian allies during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Tuesday with a fierce address.
“To the Assad regime, Russia, and Iran, your forces and proxies are carrying out these crimes. Your barrel bombs and mortars and airstrikes have allowed the militia in Aleppo to encircle tens of thousands of civilians in your ever tightening noose,” Power said.
The U.N. Security Council meeting was called amid reports that pro-government forces, on the brink of fully recapturing the city of Aleppo from opposition fighters after a month of intense bombing and a ferocious ground offensive, had summarily executed dozens of civilians as they moved to clear rebel-held areas on Monday.

“It is your noose,” Power said. “Three member states of the U.N. contributing to a noose around civilians. It should shame you. Instead, by all appearances, it is emboldening you. You are plotting your next assault. Are you truly incapable of shame?”
Many of the civilians executed by pro-government forces were injured and awaiting treatment in the city's makeshift medical facilities, according to reports from the scene. Others were trying to flee their homes.

It's “a complete meltdown of humanity,” U.N. humanitarian spokesperson Jens Laerke said.
The pro-government forces also reportedly set fire to a building used to house people who had been displaced in the fighting, with possibly more than 100 children trapped inside.
“Is there literally nothing that can shame you?” Power said. “Is there no act of barbarism against civilians, no execution of a child, that gets under your skin? That just creeps you out a little bit? Is there nothing you will not lie about or justify?”

The Russian Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday that stories of hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in Aleppo were “Russophobic chatter” and that any civilians remaining in the city were being used by rebels as human shields.
The operation to take Aleppo back from the rebels was “successful and humane in every sense in regard to civilians,” Defense Ministry spokesperson Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said.

Russia's envoy to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said on Tuesday that “nobody is going to harm the civilians.”
“The civilians, they can stay, they can go to safe places, they can take advantage of the humanitarian arrangements that are on the ground,” they said en route to the Security Council meeting.
But Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force and political director of the nonprofit, pro-opposition organization United for a Free Syria, said that “horrendous war crimes” were being perpetrated against civilians as neighborhoods fell, one by one, to regime troops.

“And it's all being done with Russian aerial cover, including cluster bombs and barrel bombs,” they told Business Insider on Monday.

After what should be considered a long time since it has actually helped Pakistan improve its military capabilities, it appears that USA has chosen to once again return to its old ways and provide support to an ally, with whom it has enjoyed a rather inconvenient relationship with both sides having a fair share of trust issues.
The U.S. – Pakistan relations
Pakistan-US relations have always been a roller coaster ride throughout the history and it would not be wrong to say that whenever Washington required help in terms of furthering in agenda, Islamabad has always offered its full support. As we have witnessed during the course of a long history between these two, US has always seemed to abandon Pakistan when the country needed its assistance the most.
As soon as Pakistan came into being, it had the choice to tilt either towards the Soviet Union or go for an Alliance with the United States. An alliance with the latter was chosen as the best case scenario by the Pakistani leaders at that time and in the next few decades, both states succeeded in reaping the rewards of this relationship even though there were a few instances where both felt wronged by one another.
However, the manner in which US has always deserted Pakistan on several instances, has forced Islamabad into branching out because the leaders and the policymakers do not want to cast their lot to a country which they believe will tuck tail and leave the moment things go south. Indeed, US policy towards Pakistan has always seemed to be more of a case of ‘take and rarely' give so Pakistan should be forgiven for deciding to start taking measures in order to edge away from an influence that has caused it more harm than good.
Following the events of 9/11, US had no option but to make Pakistan a frontline ally in the war against terrorism. Pakistan faced the most serious consequences of American war on terror and indeed the country's citizens have lost their lives by the thousands ever since US first attacked Afghanistan.
Now, it appears that Pakistan does not want its citizens to pay a cost for an alliance that seems to be nothing but a relation in which the other side has always flattered to deceive. The fact that US presidents in the last 15 years have never toured Pakistan and have always visited neighboring India clearly shows that for Washington, Pakistan has always been nothing more than an expendable resource. Now, Islamabad has started realizing that.
USA's loss and Russia and China's gain?
US might still be the only superpower at the moment but recent shifts suggest that this might not remain the case for long with other hopefuls starting to show up and challenging US hegemony. The likes of China and Russia have been making bold moves in recent years and have already shown a keen willingness in their part to help Pakistan both economically and militarily which means that Islamabad has better and maybe even much more profitable alliances to look forward to.
In August this year, the two countries signed a landmark defense deal that saw Russia sell four Mi-35 ‘Hind E' helicopters to the country's military. The deal was being discussed for over a year but now that it has been signed, signals an end to the bitter relations between the two during the cold-war era.
Pakistan Chief of Army Staff, General Raheel Sharif's visit to Russia in June where they spent around 15 hours at an arms expo that featured Russia's latest weapons and military equipment was a clear sign of Russia's willingness to help Pakistan. Indeed, Vladimir Putin is aware of the importance of Pakistan as an ally in their grand scheme of things.
Moreover, Russia is also reportedly going to enhance cooperation further following exchange visits of military commanders of both states in recent years.
And if that was not proof enough of the shift in Pakistan's foreign policy, recent moves made by China are a further proof that Islamabad is already breaking away from an uncomfortable relationship with a state which it believes, has let it down on countless occasions.
For years, Pakistan had been asking US to provide it with drones in order to help eradicate elements responsible for countless suicide attacks and bombings throughout the country. The US however, rejected those requests but chose to use killer drones in a bid to cleanse the country's volatile border.
Now, Pakistan can manufacture drones indigenously and where its drone program comes up short, China is willing to provide it with expertise.
All this has put US in a very awkward position and it has realized that its traditional policy toward Pakistan is coming back to haunt it. US policymakers it seems, are now trying to minimize the damage their recent decisions have caused and want to be more active in order to make up to a country which is a vital clog for their foreign policy goals.
Several new defense and civil projects have been launched, especially with the help of China, while Islamabad and Moscow are really warming up to each other. In short, Pakistan isn't really missing US at all.
A little too late?
Although US has agreed to provide Pakistan precision strike capabilities in the near future, one has to question if it's a really desperate move from Washington to patch things up with a country that is slowly slipping away from its influence?
American policymakers do realize that they have to change their mindset toward Pakistan but on the same hand, they need to realize that the Pakistani authorities would definitely have a trick up their sleeves and will use USA's efforts as a great chance to fill the gaps it has in its defensive and offensive capabilities while also making sure that a major chunk of assistance is taken from Moscow and Beijing.
U.S trying to retain an ally?
Since its early days, Pakistan has been always an important ally for Pentagon, thanks to its geographical location. And in the coming years, Pakistan's importance to US cannot be ignored. However, broken promises and duality has really started costing US and it is high time for Washington to wake up before the damage it has done is irrevocable.
Currently US shuffling across the board and doing all it can in a bid to stop the Chinese armada that has already become so influential in Pakistani policy and they are unsuccessful in doing it. With the growing economic corporation with Beijing and rapidly growing bilateral ties with Moscow, has forced Washington to offer Pakistan gifts that China and Russia cannot. And although this is going to help Pakistan from a defensive point of view, it is basically US making attempts to keep a bird in its cage like it has for years.
The growing power of eastern block is alarming for Washington, as not only economically but also militarily, they are getting strong and forming alliances that will help challenge America's global presence and influence. This alliance can shift the economic hub and can tilt the balance of power towards the east. Though it is not simple as it sounds but the reality is that it is happening, albeit at a slow pace.
Now, it is up to US policymakers how they want to change all that. Changing the tone towards Pakistan might be a good start indeed!

Sadio Mane is ready to show Manchester United what they missed out on as the Liverpool attacker vowed: “We will beat them.”
United made an approach for the Senegal international in the summer of 2015 but they opted to remain at Southampton.
When Liverpool came knocking 12 months later, Mane jumped at the chance to complete a £30million move and they have proved an instant hit at Anfield.
Asked about United's interest, Mane said: “Ronald Koeman was not happy with all the rumours because they wanted me to stay, but it was not too complicated because for me it was not time to go.
“When I spoke to them I told him: ‘No problem, I will stay'. It was my decision. I wanted to stay at Southampton.

“I was patient because I remember after the first year I knew it was better to focus on Southampton. In my head I thought I would be there a couple more years and prove something.
“I was convinced I still had to prove something, improve more and learn more before I moved to a bigger club. But then I knew when the right time was for me.
“The extra year helped me get better, and it is important for every player to go step by step.
“It was only when Liverpool came in that I never had a second thought and knew I wanted to join.
“It was different because then was the right moment for me. I finally came to Liverpool and I was happy with that, and now I'm happy I am playing against Manchester United.”

Mane is loving life under Jurgen Klopp and is confident the in-form Reds, who are chasing a sixth straight win in all competitions, will prove too strong for Jose Mourinho's side at Anfield on Monday night.
“We are going to beat Manchester United,” they told the Telegraph.
“We all believe it. We are going to make it. Maybe this will be the biggest game I have played in. Everyone would like to score in a game like this.
“Everyone likes Klopp.  They are one of the best in the world and for us to have the chance to have them as a coach makes us all happy.
“He knows how to motivate players, engage with them and give you more confidence. They tell us all to always be hungry to win and become one of the best. Whenever I play I know I have the support to help me.”
Does not actually provide abortions.
Remember how the House Republicans came to power in 2010 with their whole "jobs, jobs, jobs, all we care about are jobs" pitch? And how they haven't actually done anything on jobs because apparently, they think all the jobs are hidden in American women's lady parts?
Well, here's yet another not-a-jobs idea from the super-geniuses of the Republican House:
A Homeland Security spending bill approved by the GOP-led House on Thursday includes a provision to bar Immigration and Customs Enforcement from providing abortions for illegal immigrant detainees.
Oh, sure. Go to Planned Parenthood for your abortions if you must—after all, that's 237 percent of what they do there, according to various not-intended-to-be-factual Republican statements—but all the hippest chicks know ICE is the place to go for all your lady part needs. When you're not getting your pap smears at Walgreens , that is.
So how is this latest bill supposed to create jobs, save the economy, and preserve democracy for lightbulb freedom?
The measure, proposed by Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., would block ICE from using agency funding to provide abortion services for detainees except in the case of rape, incest or if their life of the mother would be endangered.
Oh, okay. So immigration officials won't be allowed to spend any more of our taxpayer dollars on abortions. Austerity and all. Guess it's a good thing Republicans are spending their time trying to save us a buck, right?
Except for one teeny, tiny, barely-worth-mentioning detail:
Barbara Gonzalez, an ICE spokesperson, said the agency has not paid for abortion services since its 2003 creation.
Never mind.
It's time to get these not-jobs-creating, time-wasting, conspiracy theorizing, lady part fetishists out of office so we can get back to actually focusing on real problems.
Let's help Democrats take back the House and get that gavel back to Nancy Pelosi. Chip in $3 or whatever you can to elect House Democrats.

The fate of Robert Mueller, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, is shaping up to be the next big political battleground. On Friday, Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier told a California radio station that they heard rumors that President Donald Trump was planning to fire Mueller. Trump's political allies at Fox News have been urging them on this course. “The only thing that remains is whether we have the fortitude to not just fire these people immediately, but to take them out in cuffs,” Jeanine Pirro, whose show Trump watches and whom they have invited to the White House, said on Saturday. The next day, former Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted:
ABSOLUTE RED LINE: the firing of Bob Mueller or crippling the special counsel's office. If removed or meaningfully tampered with, there must be mass, popular, peaceful support of both. The American people must be seen and heard - they will ultimately be determinative. — Eric Holder (@EricHolder) December 17, 2017
The president rejected the idea that they were planning to fire Mueller, telling reporters on Sunday, “No, I'm not.” Yet in the same exchange with reporters, they expressed dismay that Mueller's investigation had acquired thousands of emails from the presidential transition team, which a Trump lawyer alleges were “unlawfully produced.” “Not looking good, it's not looking good,” the president said. “It's quite sad to see that, my people were very upset about it.”
Firing Mueller would create a legitimacy crisis, which is why liberals groups like Move On are justified in taking Holder's “RED LINE” comment to heart by organizing protests in the event that Mueller is kicked out. Still, Trump's comments, as well as the behavior of their legal team and their allies in the media, point to a path that Trump could pursue that is equally dangerous and more likely to be successful. Firing Mueller outright risks a backlash. The shrewder strategy would be to delegitimize and sabotage them instead.
As Mike Allen noted in Axios, “the Trump lawyers' strategy is to cooperate with Mueller on the inside game. The outside chorus tries to rough up Mueller, in case their findings are trouble for POTUS.” That chorus has also obsessed over two FBI agents, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who were removed from the investigation over anti-Trump text messages. “Is the FBI part of the resistance?” Fox News host Jesse Watters asked on Sunday. “It's like the FBI had Michael Moore investigating the president of the United States.”

ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Several years ago, I was consulted by a young woman who was 33 weeks pregnant and was on their way to Kansas get an abortion. I informed them of the multiple options available to them outside of abortion and they decided to go through with the pregnancy even though the child had hydrocephalus and required neurosurgical intervention after birth a few weeks later. They kept the baby and loves the beautiful child that has resulted.
A couple of decades ago, I came into the pediatric Intensive Care Unit on morning rounds and was told about a four-year-old girl who had been hit by an ice cream truck, and was comatose and exhibiting little neurological function other than reactive pupils. I tested their pupillary reflexes and both pupils were fixed and dilated. The staff indicated to me that this is something that must have just occurred. I grabbed the bed and with some help, transported them quickly to the operating room for an emergency craniotomy. I was met along the way by a senior neurosurgeon who told me I was wasting my time and that at best, we would end up with someone in a vegetative state.
Nevertheless, we completed the operation and a few days later, their pupils became reactive and they eventually left the hospital. I saw them a few years ago walking through the hospital with their own 4-year-old little girl. They were neurologically fully intact and told me they had become somewhat of a celebrity because of the experience I just related. What do these two stories have in common? They both involve precious lives that could easily have been discarded.
My entire professional life has been devoted to saving and enhancing lives. Thus, the thought of abortion for the sake of convenience does not appeal to me. I have personally met several people who have told me that their mothers had considered abortion, but happily decided against it.
Most of us instinctively want to protect helpless creatures and sometimes go to great lengths to do so. The television commercials about abused animals are very poignant and as a society, we sometimes delay or cancel large construction projects to protect an “endangered” insect, amphibian or fish. Yet many of us turn a blind eye to the wanton slaughter of millions of helpless human babies who are much more sophisticated than some of the other creatures, when nothing is at stake other than the convenience of one or both parents. I am not saying that we should abandon our efforts to save baby seals and a host of other animals. Rather I am saying shouldn't we consider adding human fetuses and babies to the list?
Watching the human fetus develop is awe-inspiring. In less than three months from conception, the little hands and feet are quite recognizable and distinct facial features characterize cute, but very tiny human beings. From Day One, neurons of the brain are proliferating at a rate that will yield a staggering 100 billion neurons by birth. In a matter of nine months from conception, we have a living, breathing, eating, vocal human being who just two months later is socially interactive. Some people oppose having pregnant women view ultrasonic pictures of their developing babies because they do not want an emotional bond to develop. Careful unbiased contemplation however, might yield the conclusion that such bonding is essential to the survival of humankind. Successful farmers nourish and protect their growing crops and if conditions threaten their crops, they do what is necessary to protect them. Rather than attack the analogy, think about how much more precious a human life is than a stalk of corn.
It is important to try to understand the emotional state of young women seeking an abortion. Instead of judging and condemning them, we need to provide compassion and support. They need to be provided with easy access to adoption services and information about assistance available to them if they decide to keep the baby. I have visited many warm, inviting facilities around the country that exist solely for the purpose of helping these young women.
It is equally, if not more important, to reach these young women before they become pregnant. Forget about those politically correct people who say all lifestyles are equal and inform those young women about the true consequences of out-of-wedlock birth for those who are not financially independent. We need to make sure they understand that they can provide a much better life for themselves and their children when they plan ahead and value themselves appropriately.
As a society, we cannot be afraid to discuss important social and moral issues. Our heritage as a nation is built on compassion, forgiveness and understanding. Courage is also vitally important because those who stand on godly principles and values will be attacked. Attempting to characterize love and compassion for human life as a “war on women” is deceitful and pathetic. We the people must stop allowing ourselves to be manipulated by those with agendas that do not include regard for the sanctity of life.

Homeless Tom Cronin has been found ON SAN FRANCISCO

Take a bow, San Francisco.
Tom Cronin, a homeless man suffering from severe epilepsy, whose family had been desperately trying to find them and get them help for over a month, was found Sunday.
They were in the emergency room at San Francisco General Hospital, where they were held until their brother Dan could drive up from Big Sur, where they live.
To find their brother safe - except for some bruises and a black eye - was such a sudden and unexpected Christmas miracle that the brothers and sisters were a little overwhelmed. Sister Lisa, who immediately boarded a plane to fly here from Florida, wrote that "I can't seem to stop crying."
"I was truly amazed at the way people mobilized," Dan said. "It says a lot about who we can be when there is a need."
Dan says the moment people read about their plight in Saturday's column, their phone started to ring. I know the feeling. The day the column appeared I heard from people like Yury, a cabdriver, who said they would be working the weekend near the places where Tom was last seen and would be looking for him.
Readers suggested locations where homeless men often camp and some wrote that they were sure they'd seen Tom on the street. But the breakthrough came Sunday when BART police Officer Rodney Barrera, who works in the canine unit, spotted Tom.
Cronin looked pretty rough. Their epilepsy is so serious that when they suffer a seizure he's completely incapacitated. The Cronin family had heard that they had been assaulted and lost their belongings more than once.
Barrera got Tom to the emergency room and arranged to have the hospital contact Dan. They drove up from Big Sur in a pounding rain.
"When I got there Tommy was on a gurney," Dan said. "He was pretty out of it. But when I told them who I was, they recognized me. And then they started tearing up."
By that afternoon Tom was released to Dan's care, and the two checked in to a hotel on Geary Street to rest and wait for the arrival of Lisa at the airport.
"We're going to let them settle in for two or three days, and then Lisa will take them back to Florida," Dan said.
Lisa works with the homeless at a soup kitchen there, and says they have access to lots of services and medical help that can improve Tom's condition. It's going to take some time.
"He's probably in the worst shape I've ever seen him," Dan said. "He can't walk much faster than a toddler. It takes them awhile to register a question, and then a while for them to answer."
But after what he's been through, things can only be getting better.
Tom left the United States 10 years ago to live in Japan with their then-wife. For most of that time, the family heard from them regularly via e-mail and letters. But when the correspondence stopped abruptly, they couldn't learn what had happened.
Dan believes it had to do with Tom's visa, which expired. Eventually they learned that Tom and their wife had divorced, so they had no standing in Japan without a visa. The details, however, remain sketchy.
"I think they deported them to San Francisco, and they ended up being dumped on the street."
From there it was a matter of locating Tom, who by then was deeply confused and disoriented. They didn't even know they were in San Francisco until Bill Salame and their wife spotted them near 16th Street. Afterward, Salame discovered the website findtomcronin.com, which Dan had created.
Salame contacted Dan, and that started the chain of events that resulted in Tom returning to their family.
"He was lost," Salame wrote in an e-mail. "And now they are found. Merry Christmas."
Liberal MP breaks ranks to oppose sale of TAB
Updated
The State Government is facing growing internal opposition at the prospect of selling the TAB, with a Liberal MP breaking ranks to speak out against it.
The Government has flagged selling the state-owned betting agency as part of a raft of privatisations to reduce state debt, but says it will not be part of an initial group of assets sold.
Belmont MP Glenys Godfrey has told Parliament selling the TAB would lead to short-term gains, but cause pain in the long run.
"It provides our budget with an ongoing income stream worth millions of dollars a year and it's an asset that supports an important industry - important through its contribution to the tourism industry and through the tens of thousands of Western Australians it employs," they said.
"If selling the TAB reduced investment in horse racing infrastructure, then we're missing a great opportunity to promote Western Australian racing to Asia."
Some WA Nationals MPs have also rejected the idea, saying they fear it would hurt regional racing.
Nationals leader Terry Redman said last month they were yet to be convinced about the merits of selling the TAB.
They said while asset sales were important to improve the state's finances, they were "unconvinced yet that we need to look at the TAB".
The TAB injects more than $126 million into the WA racing industry each year and many have raised concerns that privatising the betting agency could put that funding in jeopardy.
WA is now the only Australian government to own a bookmaking business after the ACT sold its TAB for more than $105 million.

A number of SOPA-style anti-piracy amendments to Canadian laws have been introduced by the Canadian Intellectual Property lobby in its report to policymakers. If implemented, the proposals could reshape Canada's IP policy altogether.
­Inspired by US anti-piracy efforts, the Canadian Intellectual Property Council has issued a report that outlines anti-piracy legislative priorities for the coming years. The 32-page document calls for the introduction of SOPA-style policies and the implementation of ACTA in Canada.
In the view of CIPC, blocking orders, domain seizure, and contributory liability are very “useful tools to encourage the cooperation of intermediaries who do not wish to be involved in the illicit activity.”
The proposed changes target thousands of intermediaries between content providers and consumers. CIPC calls for an introduction of amendments to ensure “the ability to obtain injunctions against third-party intermediaries.”
Another part of the report suggests significant changes to Canadian law in order to “keep up with international best practices” outlined in the notorious ACTA agreement.
The CIPC wants to increase powers for border officials to “to detain, seize and destroy counterfeit products” without requiring the rights holder to obtain a court order, effectively legalizing border searches without court oversight.
­The Canadian Intellectual Property Council (CIPC) is a coalition of business groups working together under the banner of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. CIPC says its goal is to improve Canada's economic competitiveness by “ensuring the adoption of world-class intellectual property protection.” The Canadian Chamber of Commerce positions itself as a vital connection between business and the federal government, working to shape public policy and decision-making “to the benefit of businesses, communities and families across Canada.”
It also calls for the introduction of criminal liability for importing counterfeit goods, which, due to the broadness of the proposals, could potentially hit any individual traveller who does it unintentionally.
The report recommends the creation of several new agencies and enforcement teams in order to “effectively face the challenges presented by counterfeiting in the digital age.” The “interagency intellectual property council” and "specialized IP crime task force" should be “sufficiently” funded, which according to Canadian copyright scholar Michael Geist would require hundreds of millions of tax dollars.
The report, entitled Counterfeiting in the Canadian Market: How Do We Stop It?, is the most extreme IP policy document ever released in Canada, Geist wrote in their analysis of the proposals. It was lobbied by major software groups, pharmaceutical companies, content providers, the Canadian Recording Industry Association and the Motion Picture Association. Over the past several years, the group lobbied two similar reports: “A Roadmap for Change” by the Canadian Anti-Counterfeiting Network in 2007 and “A Time for Change” by CIPC in 2009.
Meanwhile, the controversial ACTA treaty, which is on the brink of being rejected by European Parliament, is facing another day of global protests. On June 9, more than 120 Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement actions are planned to take place around the world, including protests in Canada, the US, Japan, and many cities in Europe.
Remember that thing Google put together a comic book about? Chrome is its name, and Web browsing and AJAX crunching is its game. Well, just recently the latest beta builds are said to have basic Greasemonkey support. With emphasis on basic.
According to Martin at gHacks, the fact that Google doesn't yet support an extension system within Chrome means that there are some pretty significant ifs and buts about what's possible and what's not with the addition of Greasemonkey. Script loading and a metadata issues are purported to be conflict prone.
As Martin writes, “Only scripts in c:\scripts are loaded and only if the user adds the parameter ‘–enable-greasemonkey' by appending it to the program's shortcut.” They go on to explain that, “The scripts are not limited to a domain but will work on all domains which is usually handled by the @include metadata. The metadata part is ignored which could be problematic....”
The reason for Greasemonkey's emergence in Chrome, however stifled, is because the software's creator, Aaron Boodman, is a Google employee, as Google Operating System's Alex Chitu describes.
If you're looking to give the latest Greasemonkey-enhanced Chrome build, you can venture over to the Chromium BuildBot website. You're able to download the most recent development, but keep in mind that stability is not guaranteed.

VIII. SALT AS A MAGICAL SUBSTANCE
The natives of Morocco regard salt as a talisman against evil, and a common amulet among the Neapolitan poor is a bit of rock-salt suspended from the neck. The peasants of the Hartz Mountain region in Germany believe that three grains of salt in a milk-pot will keep witches away from the milk; and to preserve butter from their uncanny influences, it was a custom in the county of Aberdeen, Scotland, some years ago, to put salt on the lid of a churn. In Normandy, also, the peasants are wont to throw a little salt into a vessel containing milk, in order to protect the cow who gave the milk from the influences of witchcraft.
Peculiar notions about the magical properties of salt are common among American negroes. Thus in some regions a new tenant will not move into a furnished house until all objects therein have been thoroughly salted, with a view to the destruction of witch-germs. Another example of the supernatural attributes ascribed to salt is the opinion current among uneducated people in some communities of its potency in casting a spell over obnoxious individuals. For this purpose it is sufficient either to sprinkle salt over the sleeping form of an enemy, or on the grave of one of their ancestors. Another kind of salt-spell in vogue in the south of England consists in throwing a little salt into the fire on three successive Friday nights, while saying these words:
It is not this salt I wish to burn,
It is my lover's heart to turn;
That be may neither rest nor happy be,
Until they come and speaks to me.
On the third Friday night the disconsolate damsel expects their lover to appear. Every one is familiar with the old saying, "You can catch a bird with your hand, if you first put some salt on its tail." This quaint expression has been thought to imply that, if one can get near enough to a bird to place salt on its tail, its capture is an easy matter. The phrase, however, may be more properly attributed to a belief in the magical properties of salt in casting a spell over the bird. Otherwise any substance mioht be equally effective for the purpose of catching it. The writer remembers having read somewhere an old legend about a young man who playfully threw some salt on the back of a witch sitting next to them at table, and the witch thereupon acquired such an increase of avoirdupois that they were unable to move until the young man obligingly brushed away the salt.
The ancient Teutons believed that the swift flight of birds was caused by certain powerful spirits of the air. Now salt is a foe to ghostly might, imparts weight to bodies, and impedes their motion; therefore the rationale of its operation when placed upon a bird's tail is easily intelligible.
In the Province of Quebec French Canadians sometimes scatter salt about the doors of their stables to prevent those mischievous little imps called lutins from entering and teasing the horses by sticking burrs in their manes and tails. The lutin or gobelin is akin to the Scandinavian household spirit, who is fond of children and horses, and who whips and pinches the former when they are naughty, but caresses them when good. In Marsala, west Sicily, a horse, mule, or donkey, on entering a new stall, is thought to be liable to molestation by fairies. As a precautionary measure, therefore, a little salt is placed on the animal's back, and this is believed to insure freedom from lameness, or other evil resulting from fairy spite. Common salt has long enjoyed a reputation as a means of procuring disenchantment. It was an ingredient of a salve "against nocturnal goblin visitors" used by the Saxons in England, and described in one of their ancient leech-books; while in the annals of folk-medicine are to be found numerous references to its reputed virtues as a magical therapeutic agent. In Scotland, when a person is ailing of some affection whose nature is not apparent, as much salt as can be placed on a sixpence is dissolved in water, and the solution is then applied three times to the soles of the patient's feet, to the palms of their hands, and to their forehead.  They are then expected to taste the mixture, a portion of which is thrown over the fire while saying, "Lord, preserve us frae a' skaith."
The Germans of Buffalo valley in central Pennsylvania believe that a boy may be cured of homesickness by placing salt in the hems of their trousers and making them look up the chimney.
In India the natives rub salt and wine on the affected part of the body as a cure for scorpion bites, believing that the success of this treatment is due to the supernatural virtue of the salt in searing away the fiends who caused the pain. An ancient Irish charm of great repute in cases of suspected "fairy-stroke" consisted in placing on a table three equal portions of salt in three parallel rows. The would-be magician then encircles the salt with their arm and repeats the Lord's Prayer thrice over each row. Then, taking the hand of the fairy-struck person, they say over it, "By the power of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, let this disease depart and the spell of evil spirits be broken." Then follows a solemn adjuration and command addressed to the supposed demon, and the charm is complete.
In Bavaria and Ukraine, in order to ascertain whether a child has been the victim of bewitchment, the mother licks its forehead; and if their sense of taste reveals thereby a marked saline flavor, they are convinced that their child has been under the influence of an evil eye.
In the Swiss canton of Bern a person is believed to be amply fortified against all kinds of spiritual enemies by the simple expedient of carrying a piece of fresh bread and a psalm-book in the right and left coat pockets respectively, provided one is careful to have some rock-salt either in each vest pocket, or inside a briarwood cane upon which three crosses have been cut. In Bohemia a mother seeks to protect their daughter from evil glances by placing a little bread and salt in their pocket; and when a young girl goes out for a walk the mother sprinkles salt on the ground behind her, so that they may not lose them way.
Holy water has been employed in the religious ceremonies of many peoples as a means of purifying both persons and things, and also to keep away demons. Sprinkling and washing with it were important features of the Greek ritual.
The holy water of the Roman Catholic Church is prepared by exorcising and blessing salt and water separately, after which the salt is dissolved in the water and a benediction pronounced upon the mixture. In the Hawaiian ritual, sea-water was sometimes preferred.
A Magyar house-mistress will not give any salt to a woman who may come to the door and ask for it in the early morning, believing that any such would-be borrower is surely a witch; but in order to keep away all witches and hags, they strew salt on the threshold. On St. Lucien's Day neither salt nor fire must be taken out of the house.
Among the Japanese, the mysterious preservative qualities of salt are the source of various superstitions. The mistress of a household will not buy it at night and when purchased in the daytime a small quantity is thrown into the fire in order to prevent discord in the family, and to avert misfortune generally.
In Scotland salt was formerly in high repute as a charm, and the salt-box was the first chattel to be removed to a new dwelling. When Robert Burns, in the year 1789, was about to occupy a new house at Ellisland, they were escorted on their route thither along the banks of the river Nith by a procession of relatives, and in their midst was borne a bowl of salt resting on the family Bible.
In some places in the north of England the giving away of salt is a dangerous procedure; for if the salt thus given comes into the possession of an evil-wisher, it places the donor entirely in the power of such a person.
In upper Egypt, previous to the setting out of a caravan, it is customary for the native women to throw salt on burning coals, which are carried in earthen vessels and set down before the different loads. While so doing they exclaim, "May you be blessed in going and coming," and such incantations they believe render inert all the machinations of evil spirits.
Video: Watch locals in Brazil save stranded dolphins
It was just another day on the beach for holidaymakers off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when a pod of about 30 dolphins swam ashore on Monday. Beachgoers quickly came to the rescue, rushing into the sea and dragging the dolphins by their fins and tails into deeper water.
The whole episode was captured by Gerd Traue in a video (above), which has racked up over a million views online.
What can experts learn from the footage? The species involved, for one. These are common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), which typically live a long way off shore, says Mark Simmonds of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, a global charity.

However the video does not reveal what caused the stranding – fishing boats or sonar are two possibilities.
Had experts rescued the dolphins, says Simmonds, they may have examined the individuals for damage, such as net marks, that may have provided clues. But they say the dolphins in the video appear to be healthy.
Out of their depth
The topography of the coastline may have disoriented the dolphins, says Michael Moore of the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. It would not be surprising if offshore dolphins like these had trouble navigating the sandbars and silty seabeds found in shallow waters.
Nor is it surprising that such a large number of dolphins would head for land together. Dolphins are social creatures, so it would take only one member of the pod to go astray – say, if it was diseased – and the others would follow.
This social behaviour is what makes mass strandings of cetaceans so common. In the last month, for example, 179 dolphins have reportedly been stranded in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
Call in the experts
Understanding what's going on in such cases is especially hard because scientists must rely largely on postmortem evidence. Moore and others are trying to develop early warning systems to get to the dolphins while they're still alive.
Sensors deployed in regions where strandings are common, for example, could detect the sounds of the cetaceans nearing shore and send a text message warning officials of an imminent stranding.
The Brazilian video has widely been greeted as a good news story. But Simmonds is uneasy about this.
“There's a clock ticking, so it's important to respond quickly, but it's also important to move them in the right ways,” they say. Typically it's best not to touch the animals and to call in experts instead, they say. “Pulling their flippers can dislocate their bones, or even pull a flipper right off.”
Linden Lab JUST released this press release;
2014-02-05
SAN FRANCISCO — February 5, 2014 — Linden Lab®, the makers of Second Life®, BlocksworldTM, DesuraTM, and more, today announced that Ebbe Altberg will lead the company as its new Chief Executive Officer.
Most recently prior to joining Linden Lab, Altberg was COO of BranchOut. Prior to that, they were part of the executive team at Yahoo!, most recently as SVP of Media Products. Their more than 25 years of experience managing teams that create world-class products and services also includes leadership roles at Ingenio (acquired by at&t Interactive) and Microsoft.
“We remain committed to world-changing innovation from Linden Lab,” said Jed Smith of the company's Board of Directors. “We're keenly focused on providing incredible experiences for all of our customers, and Ebbe is the perfect person to help lead our team as we continue to serve and grow our global audience of active users.”
“Linden Lab has long been at the forefront of building experiences that entertain people while empowering them to express themselves and profit from their creations,” said Altberg. “Our customers' creativity is unparalleled, and I'm proud to join the talented team that serves them. Second Life is now in its eleventh year, and every day, users continue to create more and more amazing experiences to enjoy. Though much younger, Blocksworld has already seen hundreds of thousands of unique user-created worlds shared for everyone to play with. I'm absolutely committed to supporting our customers and helping them become even more successful. There are significant opportunities ahead, and I look forward to leading us into the next phase of growth.”
I can't say I've heard of mr Altberg or the projects he's worked on in their previous career.
I do of course know about Yahoo and am afraid that I can't say many positive things about that company.
I will do some more research but so far I've not found much evidence that suggests Mr Altberg has any experience with Virtual Worlds, as a user or otherwise.
But I guess we'll have to give them a chance and find out a bit more about them first.
I hope they will be willing to throw themselves into this and actually create an avatar and become part of Second Life.
After all, you must understand the goods you're selling.
And I hope they will improve the communication between LL and its users, talk to us!
They already made a first good step by being on Twitter and actually responding 🙂
A good first step would be an interview with Draxter at the Drax files
I am sure their last name is no reason to worry us… mr “Alt Mountain” 😉
Mr Altberg is descrbibed on LinkedIn as follows;
Over 20 years experience managing teams that define, produce and operate world class software, packaged or hosted, on multiple platforms and across numerous product categories and technologies. Create fantastic and profitable experiences that positively impact millions of people. Specialties:Team development, strategy, provide vision, software and business inventions, product design, engineering, product/program management, quality engineering, operations. Manage teams that invent, create, define, spec, build, produce, test, ship, market and operate products.
Philippe CassereauVP of Technology at Disney describes them as;
Ebbe is a very strong business and product leader able to filter the noise and distill a crisp vision and direction for their team. They were instrumental in shifting the thinking in Yahoo Media from being vertically silo'ed to instead a strong platform SaaS horizontal approach at global scale. As a manager, Ebbe is able to inspire action and results without micro-managing their staff and trusting their teams to figure out the details, while setting a consistent direction and vision for their organization. They have great skills at filtering through the minutia and details of running a large organization and zeroing instead quickly of what is really important for the business.
Noelia Fernández ArroyoVP, Media Network, EMEA at Yahoo! describes them as follows;
Ebbe has been so critical in my career and the moment we live in Yahoo! They have a superb intuition and determination to build great teams and leaders, where people contribute to same goal and over perform. They also have a genuine and unique vision for Media on the Internet, how to create content in scale and leverage platforms and technology to create the best content experiences.  They are also a true global thinker, as they see beyond geographies and team sizes and allows and creates flexibility.  They are an architect, a creator of ideas as well as a builder. This is so key in the leadership we need to day on the Internet, to keep reinventing and innovating. I look forward to the day I can work with them again!
Nitin AhujaVP Engineering at SmartShoot.com says;
Ebbe has the unique ability to focus on a problem and always find an elegant solution.  They are a natural leader and is able to rally everyone around them in working towards making the customer happy. Ebbe can absorb large amounts of technical information and use it build innovative and useful features and products. Having worked with them for over eight years I have come to respect their judgment and their flair for product design.
It is of course to be expected that praise on LinkedIn is always positive but it seems Mr Altberg is mostly someone who can run a company well.
I fear that we at Second Life need a bit more than just a good manager though.

JERRY BROWN, the veteran governor of California, is basking in glory. The golden state, once described as America's Greece because of its fiscal woes, is reporting a $1.2 billion budget surplus (see article). But the euphoria is premature. California still has a mammoth long-term pension gap. If it used the same pension accounting standards as private companies must, its total debts would be a terrifying $1 trillion.
Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.
California is far from alone. Few fiscal problems are as grave, or as little understood, as underfunded state and municipal pensions. The funding gap for all state schemes is estimated at $4 trillion—25% of GDP.
Politicians long ago realised that if you offer public-sector workers bigger retirement benefits, they vote for you today and the bill does not arrive for years. Some states have allowed staff to “spike” their final-salary pensions by racking up lots of overtime in their last year on the job, vastly increasing their retirement payouts. Some retire with packages worth millions. The states granted these generous benefits on the basis of recklessly optimistic assumptions, such as that their pension funds' assets would continue to generate the same bumper returns as during the equity bull market of the 1980s and 1990s.
It gets worse. To calculate the cost of pensions, one must use a discount rate on future liabilities. The higher the discount rate, the lower the liabilities appear to be. States and municipalities use the expected return on assets in their pension funds, which they guess to be 7.5%. But this is a strange approach. The liability will still exist even if the expected return is not achieved. If the stockmarket performs badly, taxpayers will have to make up the shortfall. Pensions are a bond-like liability, so the discount rate should be based on a bond yield. In any case, the states' assumed investment return is far too high at a time when Treasury bonds yield a piffling 2%.
Rosy assumptions allow the states to put less money in the pension pot today. In the private sector, companies discount their liabilities in their accounts at a median rate of 4.7%. Falling bond yields have made defined-benefit pensions far costlier; many private companies have therefore closed their schemes to new members or shut them entirely. The states, by contrast, can pretend that their promises are affordable.
Stop digging
Not everyone is fooled. Moody's, a ratings agency, is switching to a discount rate based on bond yields when calculating the states' creditworthiness. Amazingly, even under their own rosy assumptions, state pension schemes are in trouble. In Illinois they are only 40% funded; in New Jersey, 53%. As people live longer, their pensions cost more. In California, the giant CalPERS fund is requiring taxpayers to chip in more from 2015 and the CalSTRS fund for teachers needs an extra $4.5 billion annually for the next 30 years—more than the surplus the state is now trumpeting. The governor of Illinois, Pat Quinn, has called a special legislative session for June 19th to discuss pensions, after two ratings agencies downgraded the state's debt.
States need to wake up. The priority is to make taxpayers aware of the scale of the problem by accounting for it properly, rather than pretending the stockmarket fairy will magic it away. The second step is to do as much as legally possible to slow the growth of future benefits.
New employees should not be offered final-salary pensions. The accrued pensions of existing public-sector workers should be paid, but their benefits from now on should be renegotiated, for example by aligning pensionable ages with those for Social Security (if state courts allow it, which some, bizarrely, do not). And all the dodges, such as allowing employees to put in longer hours in their final year to increase the final-salary number, should go.
If costs are not cut, the eventual result will be a huge rise in taxes when the pension funds run out of money. The burden will fall on private-sector employees, who do not qualify for such a gilded retirement. They will not be happy.
In the eternal and eternally pointless debate on platform superiority, one thing consolers always bring up is the fact that for the bulk of gaming history (pre-Xbox hard drives and PlayStation Networks etc), their games have simply been easier to run. They arrive fault-free and work within moments of being put into the machine, whereas PC gamers are often presented with buggy, broken games that need constant patching and further downloads, battles with DRM and possibly even a blood sacrifice to get going. This has been the case ever since the mid-1980s, when home computing really took off. Early PC gamers usually had to muck about in DOS to get their games running, a hugely fiddly task akin to rearranging all the furniture in your room every time you want to sit down. By contrast, console gamers just shoved a cartridge in and started playing. So there's always been a lingering resentment and suspicion that console gamers have it too easy, and are therefore all morons, and that PC gamers have to work for their pleasure, and are therefore somehow superior.
Yes, it's all utter rubbish, and these days any gamer with money to spare usually has a PC and a console. But still we like to argue and debate it. Of all of this, though, one thing still stands true today – PC gamers are often given buggy, broken games on release. The reasons for this are many and varied, and often stem from the multi-platform nature of modern game development. This relates to publishing strategies, which in other words means keeping business executives in coke and Porsches. Fortunately though, our years of DOS-fiddling have stood us PC and Linux users in good stead, and when the goods do come through broken and banjoed, or when a favoured game finds itself lost in Abandonia, we know just what to do.
The Daggerfall world map. Each of those areas contains literally
hundreds of places to visit. Ka-pow, Skyrim!
Take, for example, Daggerfall, the second in Bethesda's magnificent Elder Scrolls series. Released in August 1996 after two years' development, Daggerfall employed Bethesda's own XnGine, one of the first truly 3D game engines, to let us roam around the Hammerfell and High Rock provinces of Tamriel. The game's world covered 161,600 square kilometres (62,394 square miles) of open, procedurally generated terrain, populated by 750,000 NPCs living in 15,000 towns, cities and dungeons. As you can imagine, a project of that size is bound to come with a few loose screws and creaking hinges, which probably wasn't helped by it being one of the first games to offer extra or exclusive content for buying it from a particular place. (In this case, extra levels to those who purchased it from CompUSA, a now-defunct, now not-defunct American high street computer chain).
Bethesda themselves were perturbed by the number of patches they had to release post-launch – the final all-in-one patch released in October 1998 rolled-in 7 individual patches. They also released a save game repair tool, as well as a CompUSA Special Edition patch which added in the exclusive stuff for everyone to enjoy. (Proving that gaming exclusivity has always been measured in dollars).
But that's just the beginning. Between then and 2012, a further 10 fan patches were released, which did everything from colouring some of the Dark elves correctly, so that they actually looked like Dark elves, to various map, spell and lingering text fixes. Then we come to the unofficial add-ons, of which there are 15 listed at uesp.net on the Daggerfall files page. These add new quests, new factions, patch previous patches, restore and repair cut content, and generally enhance the crap out of everything. The one that always gets mentioned in articles like these is AndyFall, reputed to be the first ever mod for the game, which is a great place to start as it does a little bit of everything to polish, fix and enhance the experience. There's also a ton of tools and utilities available too, because fan patches serve a common purpose, so whatever you can do to help your fellow fixers and modders helps you too. This open, altruistic approach is also how a fan patch or two, or three, can eventually evolve into a ‘community patch'. My favourite of the Daggerfall tools is Daggerfall Cartographer, which allows you to explore the 3D towns and cities of the world in peace. Remember that awesome model viewer for World of Warcraft? It's something like that.
Daggerfall is famous for its labyrinthine dungeons and towns. Now you know why.
Finally, perhaps the most significant weapons in the modern Daggerfall player's armoury are DaggerfallSetup and DaggerXL. The first of these is a magical, all-in-one solution that bundles together the game, a specifically pre-configured DOS Box, all the official patches and loads of fan fixes and custom additions into a single installer. You run it, and bingo, you play it. Questions of EMS memory limitations are (even more) a thing of the past! The second of these two beauties, DaggerXL, is a Daggerfall-specific flavour of the XL Engine, a custom-built alternative to DOS Box that allows for a specific group of old games (including the always-brilliant Dark Forces) to be run on modern systems, fuss-free and to today's technical and graphical standards. Like its brethren, DaggerXL also adds all sorts of visual tweaks and custom behind-the-scenes enhancements to make the game not only run more smoothly, but also not look like a total dog.
Although the first few fan patches began appearing within the game's own commercial lifetime, most of this wonderful, life-altering stuff was largely made possible when Bethesda released Daggefall to the public domain on the series' 15th anniversary, back in 2009. If you're tired of Skyrim, and impatient for Skywind, you can do no wrong with a bit of Daggerfall.

Wal-Mart and Bharti issued statements denying that they had violated Indian rules or laws.
“We are in complete compliance with India's F.D.I. laws,” the Indian unit of Wal-Mart said, referring to foreign direct investment. “All procedures and processes have been duly followed and details filed with relevant Indian government authorities including the Reserve Bank of India,” the central bank.
An Indian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing government policy, said Mr. Singh's office had forwarded the letter to the Ministry of Commerce, which sent it to the central bank, which oversees foreign transactions involving Indian companies, to obtain more information. The official said the investigation was not yet a formal inquiry.

Wal-Mart's actions in overseas markets have come under scrutiny in the United States, where officials are investigating allegations of bribery at its Mexican subsidiary.
Officials want to determine if the loan from Wal-Mart to Bharti was intended to skirt the letter or the spirit of the foreign investment rules. Wal-Mart lent 4.56 billion rupees ($101 million at the time) to Cedar Support Services, the parent company of Bharti Retail, on March 29, 2010.
According to Cedar Support's latest annual report, the debentures would automatically convert into a 49 percent equity stake 30 months after they were issued. It is unclear if that conversion took place last month when the 30 months elapsed or if the companies extended that deadline.

The companies' opponents are expected to argue that the terms of the debentures violated the spirit, if not the letter, of the rules because the debt was to be automatically converted into equity. Critics say the plan was a clever legal maneuver to allow Wal-Mart to quickly enter the Indian market when policymakers relaxed the restrictions on foreigners, which happened last month.
“The tragedy is we are not monitoring the end use of F.D.I. in India,” said M. P. Achuthan, the lawmaker who wrote to the prime minister. “The government has to ensure that they monitor the F.D.I. coming to India is used” only in industries where it is allowed.
Bharti is a conglomerate that also controls Airtel, the largest cellphone company in India. In recent years it has expanded aggressively into retailing with help from Wal-Mart, which supplies its stores with produce and other goods, and offers training and management support.
The partners are expected to announce a venture soon to take advantage of the recent change in the investment rules, which grant each of India's 29 states the right to keep foreign retailers out of their regions. In a telephone interview last month, the top executive at Wal-Mart's Indian operation, Raj Jain, said the company would complete its plans in the next 45 days and could open its first stores in 18 months.

India has been seen as one of the last large untapped markets for the global retailing chains. Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, is expected to open stores in India soon, and Starbucks will open its first outlet in central Mumbai on Friday.
INDIANAPOLIS – It's up to 41 games and counting when it comes to the Indianapolis Colts not having a 100-yard rusher in a game.
Make no mistake about it, the Colts will always be a pass-first team with quarterback Andrew Luck, but they spent the offseason talking about how the addition of running back Frank Gore would help ease some of the load off of their passing game.
The Colts threw the ball 49 times and rushed for a grand total of 64 yards on 17 attempts in their 13-point loss to the Buffalo Bills last week.
“We had more runs called, but they were low in blocks,” Colts coach Chuck Pagano said after the game. “They had a bunch of guys in there. We've got to be able to run the football and try to stay more balanced.”
The coach wasn't done talking about the desire to run the day after the game.
“We need to have the ability to be able to just run it,” Pagano said Monday. "[Gore] popped some good gains, first play of the game. I think they averaged 3.9 on the few carries that they had, so we've got to be better there.”
Gore's first run as a Colt went for eight yards. They rushed two more times in the first series before vanishing in the running game.
Gore didn't touch the ball again until there was less than eight minutes remaining in the first half because the Colts attempted 18 straight passes.
Let this soak in for a minute: Gore, who has rushed for at least 1,000 yards in eight of their 10 seasons, went more than 19 minutes without taking a handoff.
“I know as a quarterback, it's awesome when your run game is rolling,” Luck said. “It makes things simple. It really does. I know it helps the O-line against pass rush. I think it helps everybody. So I do think balance is important, but as you know in a football game, things happen that dictate what you can and cannot call. We've been in games before where we haven't been able to run, but we've found a way to pull a victory out. Really at the end of the day it's about getting a win. I do think balance can help you, but you can't foresee the future in every game.”
The Bills loaded the box with eight defenders, causing Luck to change plays at the line of scrimmage. But facing loaded boxes is nothing new for Gore. That's what they faced a lot of times during their career with the San Francisco 49ers. Gore has rushed for 2,092 yards and 35 touchdowns on 558 attempts in their career when facing at least eight defenders in the box.
“It's B.Y.O.B. when they put the eighth guy in there, if you can't get them blocked, then (that will) be your own blocker,” Pagano said. “Run through them, run them over, run around them and make them miss. He's done that for a long, long time, so we've got to give them and the other runners that opportunity.”
Gore added, “Whatever coach calls, I'm willing to do whatever they call. If we're going to run, we're going to run. If we've got to throw the ball, we're going to throw the ball. We've got players for both.”
A new Daily Kos/Research 2000 poll, conducted among 2,000 self-identified Republican respondents nationwide, gives an interesting peek into the psyche of the minority party's base.
Kos has not yet released the full numbers, but here's some early info on the poll that they have posted on their Twitter account:
â¢Â 39% of Republicans want President Obama to be impeached.
â¢Â 63% think Obama is a socialist.
â¢Â Only 42% believe Obama was born in the United States.â¢Â 21% think ACORN stole the 2008 election — that is, that Obama didn't actually win it, and isn't legitimately the president, with 55% saying they are “not sure.” This number is actually significantly lower than it was in a similar question from Public Policy Polling (D) back in November, which said that 52% of Republicans thought ACORN stole it. So does this mean Obama is gaining ground among Republicans? As it is, only just over 20% of Republicans will say that Obama actually won the election.

Morgan Fairchild (born Patsy Ann McClenny; February 3, 1950) is an American actor. They achieved prominence during the late 1970s and early 1980s with continuing roles in several television series, in which they usually conveyed a glamorous image.
Fairchild began their career on the CBS daytime soap opera Search for Tomorrow as Jennifer Pace from 1973 to 1977. In 1978, they appeared on the primetime soap opera Dallas as the first actor to portray Jenna Wade, before taking a lead role on the NBC series Flamingo Road in 1980 (for which they were nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama). In 1984, they co-starred on ABC's short-lived television drama Paper Dolls, and then appeared on Falcon Crest as attorney Jordan Roberts from 1985 to 1986. Fairchild has also performed in theater and played guest roles on television comedies, including Murphy Brown (for which they were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series), Roseanne, Cybill and Friends.  They are a board member of SAG-AFTRA.
Early life [ edit ]
Fairchild was born Patsy Ann McClenny in Dallas, Texas, the daughter of Martha Jane (née Hartt), a high school English teacher who taught at Richardson High School (in Richardson, Texas), and Edward Milton McClenny.[1] Fairchild has a younger sister, Cathryn Hartt, who is also an actor.[2][3] As a younger child, they were seen on WFAA's Mr. Peppermint Show with host Jerry Haynes. In their teens they were in the audience on WFAA's Sump'n Else bandstand show. They auditioned three times to be in The Little Group, which was the show's dance group. Also during this time, they appeared in several locally broadcast commercials on Dallas-Fort Worth television stations. As a child, they suffered a bout of scarlet fever, which left them partially deaf.[citation needed]
Career [ edit ]
Morgan Fairchild in June 2007
Fairchild's first acting job was as a double for Faye Dunaway during filming for the film Bonnie and Clyde (1967), particularly in scenes where Bonnie is supposed to be driving a car, because Dunaway couldn't drive a stick shift.[4][1] They took their new first name, Morgan, from the David Warner film Morgan - A Suitable Case for Treatment (1966). Fairchild then moved to New York City, where they secured their first credited onscreen role as the maniacal Jennifer Pace in the daytime soap opera Search for Tomorrow from 1973 until 1977. From the mid-1970s, they began to make various appearances on episodic primetime television series such as Kojak, Happy Days, Police Woman, and a few episodes of CBS Radio Mystery Theater.
Fairchild played Jenna Wade in the soap opera Dallas for one episode in 1978.[1] The character was later brought back, played briefly by Francine Tacker in 1980, and then as a regular character played by Priscilla Presley from 1983 to 1988. In 1978, Fairchild made the television film The Initiation of Sarah and also had a recurring role on the sitcom Mork & Mindy. In 1980, they scored their first regular primetime role as Constance Weldon Carlyle on the soap opera Flamingo Road. Though the series had an impressive beginning, the ratings soon dropped and it was cancelled after two seasons. Fairchild was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for their role.[5]
After the cancellation of Flamingo Road, Fairchild continued to make guest appearances in a variety of episodic television series such as Hotel, Simon & Simon, Magnum, P.I. and The Love Boat. They also starred in the theatrical film The Seduction (1982). In 1984, along with Joan Collins, they co-hosted the ABC-TV special Blondes vs. Brunettes, a one-hour variety show that gently poked fun at popular culture's blonde vs. brunette rivalry.[6] In that same year, they also co-starred in another primetime soap opera Paper Dolls playing modelling agency owner Racine. The series was cancelled halfway through its first season, but by this time, Fairchild was established as a television actor. In 1985, they joined the cast of the soap opera Falcon Crest, playing the glamorous lawyer Jordan Roberts for a season. They also appeared in the miniseries North and South (1985), and its sequel (1986).
Fairchild at an event in Dallas in 2006
In 1985, Jon Lovitz on Saturday Night Live created the "Tommy Flanagan, The Pathological Liar" character who claimed outlandish achievements for himself, culminating in the grand illusion that their wife was Morgan Fairchild. The obvious remoteness of such a possibility, and its mainstream comic appeal, was testimonial to the broad popularity and desirability of Fairchild at the time.
Fairchild continued to make appearances in films and television series throughout the 1980s, and garnered an Emmy Award nomination for their guest appearance in a 1989 episode of Murphy Brown.[1] In the early 1990s, they were cast in a recurring role in Roseanne, as Sandra Bernhard's bisexual girlfriend Marla. In 1994, Fairchild appeared in an unexpectedly campy advertisement campaign for clothing retailer Old Navy, with Joan Collins and other formerly familiar faces on television. Them reprised role as the over-the-top glamour vixen was so successful that the company created numerous sequels around their persona.
In 1995, Fairchild returned to daytime soap operas as the catty Sydney Chase on The City.[7] They played the role for a year, after which they went on to appear in General Hospital. They also made guest appearances on the hit sitcom Friends (as Chandler Bing's mother, Nora) and was a recurring guest star on the sitcom Cybill as Andrea, a rival of Cybill Shepherd's character.
Through the years, Fairchild has also appeared in various theater productions. More recently, they starred in the role of Mrs. Robinson in the stage adaptation of the film The Graduate. They also fronted an international advertising campaign for the consumer tooth whitening product Dental White.[8] In 2005, Fairchild appeared in the competition reality show, But Can They Sing? on VH1.
In 2006, they were cast in yet another of their "rich bitch" roles in the MyNetworkTV series Fashion House, playing Sophia Blakely, a rival to Bo Derek's character, Maria Gianni.[9] They have also appeared on the television series Chuck as Dr. Honey Woodcomb, the mother of Captain Awesome. They made another return to soap operas in 2009 when they had a guest role in the daytime series The Bold and the Beautiful.[10] In recent years, they guest-starred in Bones, Revenge and Hot in Cleveland.[11][12]
In addition to their work as an actor, Fairchild has long maintained a strong role within the Screen Actors Guild, now SAG-AFTRA. Currently, Fairchild is a three-year board member of the Guild and has served on several diverse committees, including co-chair Legislative Committee, National Executive Committee, SAG-AFTRA Relations Committee, Commercials Contracts Committee, Honors and Tributes Committee (HATS), and Guild Governance and Rules Committee.
In 2014, Fairchild was named spokesperson for a website created to help consumers make burial preplanning choices. In that capacity, they appeared on television commercials and in a direct mail campaign.
Personal life [ edit ]
Fairchild at the Desert AIDS Project in 2009
Fairchild was married to Jack Calmes from 1967 to 1973.[13] Fairchild is active in raising awareness of AIDS-related issues and environmental protection.[1]
During the early 1970s, Fairchild was kidnapped and held against their will on two separate occasions.[14][15]
Politics [ edit ]
Fairchild is a Democrat, contributing to the campaigns of well-known politicians such as Dick Gephardt, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Howard Dean.[16]

ALBANY, N.Y. - Only a few hours before the first practice of Giants training camp, Terrell Thomas was talking about how they have full confidence in their surgically repaired knee and how that confidence will grow with each successful practice.
Well, that confidence was on hold today because the Giants' starting cornerback left the first practice of training camp with stiffness in their back.
“Legs are fine,” coach Tom Coughlin said. “His back tightened up on him.”
Thomas was being stretched on the side for about 10 minutes as the rest of the team finished up individual drills. They walked off the field with trainers toward the locker room then returned shortly thereafter. They did not participate in the rest of the session and only watched from the side.
Coughlin is hopeful this won't be a long-term issue. Thomas seems to believe it won't be.
“It's God's plan,” Thomas said in a quote released by the team. “And I'm not worrying about it. It's not like I have a back spasm or messed up anything. It just really locked up on me.
“It came out of nowhere. Usually, sometimes it's just tightness. But I've never had something like this or kept me out of practice or in a game where my back locked up on me. Things happen for a reason. I'm glad that it's minor. I'll be ready to go tomorrow.”
* * * *
And now, the first practice report of training camp, beginning as always with...
THE INJURIES
The guys on PUP - WR Hakeem Nicks (foot), DT Chris Canty (knee), TE Travis Beckum and LB Clint Sintim (knee) – obviously did not practice.
RB Da'Rel Scott was hunched over at one point, though it was unclear if it was an injury or perhaps some kind of fatigue. They hung in there. We'll see if anything comes of that. (As I'm typing this, I realize I forgot to ask Coughlin about him. Aargh.)
* * * *
THE STARTERS
LB Michael Boley had a big first day and had a sequence where they were in on about four of five plays. The last of them was an interception on a ball from QB Eli Manning to WR Victor Cruz. Boley slipped underneath and easily made the pick – one of three for the defense on the day.
So much for Cruz's offseason hangover. They opened team drills with two catches, including one that elicited the first "Cruuuuuz" chant of camp when they slipped and reached behind them to make the grab. Later, during 7-on-7s, they made a tough catch on what would've been an excusable drop when they grabbed a quick slant from Manning in front of CB Corey Webster.
FB Henry Hynoski figures to be a bigger part of the passing game this year. Early on today, they caught a quick out to the right edge past LB Keith Rivers. Expect Hynoski's receiving skills to be a running theme here in these reports throughout camp.
DT Linval Joseph was in to make a couple of stops in team drills midway through practice. A lot of times, it's tough to see what's going on inside during practice, but it was evident Joseph was knifing through there.
LT Will Beatty, who will be limited in camp as they attempt to overcome a sciatic nerve issue, practiced today and seemed to be moving fine. We'll monitor how much they do moving forward.
THE BACKUPS
CB Prince Amukamara got on the board early with an interception on an overshot deep ball from QB David Carr to WR Rueben Randle. Amukamara was playing Randle well and then, when they realized the ball was going to be long, they lengthened their stride and got to it. On theirs was down the sideline on the return, they got an escort from defensive coordinator Perry Fewell, who loves to be a lead blocker for their guys.
Somebody asked me on Twitter the other day who my under-the-radar breakout guy is. I said Scott, in part because I think they can catch the ball out of the backfield. In the first team drill today, Scott dropped a ball on a short hook over the middle. They were plenty upset with themselves for that one.
Good catch by WR Ramses Barden to reach back on a quick slant in front of rookie CB Jayron Hosley. Barden made the grab with the defender right on top of him, as they often do.
CB Michael Coe had great position in front of WR Domenik Hixon on a deep ball up the left sideline from Manning that fell incomplete. Secondary coach Peter Giunta was pleased with that play and a few others when Coe came down from their spot in a zone to make a tackle.
Giunta wasn't as pleased with CB Bruce Johnson, who struggled with their footwork on a few plays. Johnson got twisted on an out route by Cruz, who couldn't make a fingertip catch on a ball a little high and outside. Johnson did come back a few plays later to close down on RB Andre Brown after they caught a wheel route.
I wrote in the spring about LB Mark Herzlich's coverage skills and they were on display again today. On one play, they were right with rookie TE Adrien Robinson on a post up the seam, forcing Carr to take a check-down pass. A few snaps later, they were right on TE Ryan Purvis' hip on a similar route.
THE YOUNG GUYS
Among the more energetic players today was DE Justin Trattou, who clearly looked to be eager to make an impression right away. Trattou was quick off the edge and hustling downplays from behind. They also maintained the edge on an end around to WR Jerrel Jernigan and their teammates appreciated the effort there.
A few minutes after Scott's drop, RB David Wilson reached up to make a nice grab on a short throw from QB Ryan Perrilloux that was above their head. Good start for Wilson, who will have to work their way up the depth chart from their current role with the third-team offense.
LB Spencer Paysinger almost picked off a short slant from Perrilloux they undercut, though Hixon thought CB Dante Hughes' holding the intended receiver made Paysinger's play on the ball possible. Hixon had a point, I believe, and Hughes was grabbing some more white jersey later on when they were covering Randle, who fought through the grasp to make a nice catch.
Paysinger had themselves a nice practice, minus one play when their angle on TE Bear Pascoe in coverage wasn't to Fewell's liking. Paysinger took much better angles on a few running plays to make Fewell happy.
Former Rutgers RB/FB Joe Martinek is out here, doing what they do ... which is pretty much everything. They had what seemed to be a good crack-back block (or as much as was allowed in this practice) on LB Greg Jones, who didn't seem to think it was a legal play.
Perrilloux was about as inaccurate as I've ever seen him. They badly missed WR Dan DePalma deep, threw at Wilson's ankles and missed a few other short throws.
Robinson couldn't make a catch they made during rookie camp that had us all gaga. It was a short throw from Perrilloux over their head to which they just didn't seem to react quickly enough.
Undrafted WR Brandon Collins made one heckuva tough grab while pretty much being beat up and sent to the ground by CB Justin Tryon as they were trying to run the quick slant. Collins has been the impressive surprise among the backup receivers, dating back to the spring.
LB Jake Muasau had an interception off a deflected pass that bounced off WR David Douglas' hands. Muasau made the diving catch and got up for the return, but a squealing Fewell wanted them to return it all the way.
* * * *
There was great anticipation for a drill that's a favorite of the players - the one where one returner tries to avoid a pair of defenders bearing down on them from about 20 yards away. Wilson and Jernigan were among the players expected to make guys miss, but they didn't. And they were booed by their teammates.
Here's hoping for more highlights the next time they do that drill.
* * * *
And something Jorge Castillo noted that I'm sure will interest you – the linebacker depth chart:
First team: Boley, Chase Blackburn, Mathias Kiwanuka
Second team: Jacquian Williams, Herzlich, Rivers
Third team: Jones, Muasau, Paysinger

Take a look at several domesticated mammal species and you might spot a number of similarities between them, including those cute floppy ears.
The famous naturalist and evolutionary theorist Charles Darwin even observed in the first chapter of theirs On the Origin of Species that:
Not a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears […]
And it's not just the ears. Domesticated animals share a fairly consistent set of differences from their wild ancestors such as smaller brains, smaller teeth, shorter curly tails and lighter and blotchy coats: a phenomenon called the “domestication syndrome”.
A paper published this week in the journal Genetics poses a new explanation as to why so many domesticated animals have such a similar set of traits.
Adam Wilkins, from South Africa's Stellenbosch Institute of Advanced Study, and colleagues propose that human selection has, in domesticated species, altered the development of the neural crest, an organ system present during embryonic development.
The silver fox experiment
The dog has been befriended by humans for at least 11,000 years, longer than any other domesticated animal. They differ from their wild ancestor wolves in all the above listed features of domestication syndrome.
Dogs aren't the only examples, of course. Humans have also domesticated cattle, horses, sheep, goats … the list goes on.
In the late 1950s, Russian fox-fur-farmer-turned-geneticist Dmitry Belyaev set up a long-term experiment to find out whether they could selectively breed the wildness out of the silver fox, which was hard to breed because of its aggressive nature.
In each generation of foxes, they bred from animals that showed the least aggression towards their captors.
It took them and their successor Lyudmilla Trut just 20 generations – only about 25 years – to create a line of silver foxes who from birth were tame enough to be kept as pets. For those who study evolution, this is an extraordinarily short time span.
But that wasn't the most surprising result. Although selected only for their temperament, the later generations of silver foxes also had shorter faces, smaller teeth, soft and droopy ears, curly tails and altered colour.
Humans might selectively breed for less “flighty” and less “fighty” beasts, but why should domesticate animals also show characteristic changes in other body features?
The neural crest
In 1868, the same year that Darwin published an entire monograph on domestication, Swiss anatomist Wilhelm Theirs Sr described what became known as the embryonic neural crest.
Vertebrate embryos at an early stage of development consist of three “germ layers”. They described a strip of cells in the outer layer (ectoderm), between the part that produces skin and the part that produces the central nervous system, and named this the Zwischenstrang (“between-strand”). It's now called the neural crest.
These cells migrate into the middle layer (mesoderm), which produces skeletal, connective, muscular, glandular and reproductive tissues.
Each germ layer was thought to produce mutually-exclusive tissues, but the bombshell came 20 years later when Russian biologist Nikolai Kastschenko proposed that archetypal middle layer tissues such as the craniofacial skeleton originated in the neural crest.
It took more than 30 years before Kastschenko's heretical observations were accepted.
Explaining domestication syndrome
Wilkins and colleagues now propose a hypothesis that links the development of the neural crest with the body changes that accompany domestication.
The neural crest produces not only facial skeletal and connective tissues, teeth and external ears but also pigment cells, nerves and adrenal glands, which mediate the “fight or flight” response.
Neural crest cells are also important for stimulating the development of parts of the forebrain and for several hormonal glands.
The researchers argue that the domestication process selects for pre-existing variants in a number of genes that affect neural crest development. This causes a modest reduction in neural crest cell number or activity. This in turn affects the broad range of structures derived from the neural crest, giving rise to domestication syndrome.
Interestingly, deleterious alterations in genes controlling neural crest development cause wide-ranging syndromes called neurocristopathies in humans and in animals.
The researchers bolster their argument using several examples including Treacher Collins, Mowat-Wilson and Waardenburg syndromes. Indeed, they suggest that the domestication syndrome resembles a mild multi-gene neurocristopathy.
Surprisingly, they fail to include Williams Syndrome, which allies a mild variation in facial development with an unusually friendly disposition, as illustrated in the last year's French-Canadian film Gabrielle.
The genetic region associated with Williams syndrome has been identified as one of the many regions in the canine genome that varies genetically between dogs and their wild ancestors, wolves.
This new hypothesis proposes one intriguing answer to the domestication question originally identified by Darwin and illustrated by Belyaev and Trut: why do all the traits of domestication co-exist in multiple species?
It may be that neural crest contributions are so diverse that it's possible to cherry-pick points of congruence to support any hypothesis. Nevertheless, the researchers suggest several lines of molecular genetic and functional experiments that can further put their ideas to the test.
Sachin Tendulkar was revered in Australia. Watching Sachin walk into the middle with the whole Australian crowd giving them a standing ovation gave Indian fans goosebumps. We took immense pride in watching one of our own earning so much respect in foreign shores.
In contrast, Virat Kohli was labelled a “spoilt brat” by the Australians in 2014. Even on their first tour to Australia in 2012, Kohli showed no remorse for showing their middle finger to a group of hecklers in the crowd at Sydney Cricket Ground. After the recently concluded Test series, Australian ex-players and media have gone all hammer and tongs, painting them as an outright villainous character. Yet, in some strange way, all this hate has made them all the more popular in their homeland.
India's biggest celebrity
Virat Kohli was Forbes India's most popular celebrity in 2016. The list puts them not just above cricketing icons like Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni, but also Bollywood superstars like Shahrukh Khan and Salman Khan. Nothing sells like brand Kohli in India. Earlier this year, they signed a Rs 100 crore endorsement deal with Puma, making them the first Indian sportsperson to do so.
It's easy to see why Kohli is so popular in India.  They are the best cricketer in a country that adores the game and its stars.  They are a fitness and style icon. They date a famous Bollywood actor. They talk like a statesman and parties like a rockstar.  They are what every youngster in India aspires to be.
As promised, tomorrow i will show you the complete video of my life story on muveacoustics.com. I can't wait! #InsideIsEverything #SoundThatInspires A post shared by Virat Kohli (@virat.kohli) on Feb 2, 2017 at 3:17am PST
An uncompromising and emotional leader
Captaincy has brought out Kohli's personality even more than before. They have built this team in their image, a team that plays tough, uncompromising cricket. The youngsters in the team look up to them and want to be like him. KL Rahul has often credited Kohli's mentorship in the Indian Premier League and Indian team for their rise.
As captain of the Indian team, Kohli is unlike any of their predecessors. In a way, they are the first unabashedly desi captain of the team. Kohli's personality is not without its flaws, but their flaws resemble our flaws and that makes them so endearing.
Tiger Pataudi taught the team to not get intimidated by the opposition and play to win. Sunil Gavaskar continuously stood up and spoke against Western hegemony in the game. Saurav Ganguly was aggressive, in-your-face and encouraged their team to fight fire with fire. But they were all still cricketing aristocracy. We admired them but didn't identify with them as much.
Kapil Dev's tendency to wear their heart on the sleeve every time they played for India made them immensely popular. MS Dhoni was the rustic, small town guy who countered intimidation with a smile rather than confrontation.
Kohli takes things more personally than anyone before him. They had said in one of their interviews, “You don't really go out there and take unnecessary things being said to you from anyone. I follow that in life, I follow that in cricket as well.” Kohli is the angry Indian man on the street. Kohli is us.
Cultural ethos of sport
When it comes to sledging, we often hear cricketers talking about “not crossing a line”. Trouble is, there is not a single universal line but many lines that depend on where you come from. Tell an Indian man on the street a “Yo mama” joke and they would find it anything but funny. The traditional way to play the sport was to leave everything that was said in the heat of the battle on the field. It was considered the honourable thing to do. Indians never found it comfortable but still tried to fit into this culture as they craved acceptance. Kohli doesn't bother with acceptance.
Indians expect the same standards on and off the field from friends. A lot has been made of Kohli's statement about not being friends with Australians, but they aren't the first one to get offended by their on-field personal abuse. AB De Villiers, in the aftermath of the 2014 Test series against Australia, had said, “I see that it's part of the game, but they can't expect us to be mates with them off the field then, if they get very personal”.
Play
On the same tour, most South Africans refused to venture into the Australian dressing room for a customary beer. David Warner, who had accused AB De Villiers of ball tampering on that tour later retracted their allegation but still defended their behaviour by saying, “We do like to be aggressive and sledging is a form of the game when we're out there.”
If cricketers want to restore some harmony to this game, then they must learn to acknowledge the lines of their opponents. The respectable and tolerant way is to appreciate the cultural difference and be more careful about not crossing someone else's line.
This is where Kohli themselves can improve as a captain. They don't need to leave their own aggressive ways, but they need to acknowledge and understand that a lot of offensive things said on the field are not intended to personally hurt anyone, they are just part of someone else's ethos, it's probably the only way they know to play.

A man suspected of taking up-skirt photos of a woman in a comic book store in North Austin in August faces a charge of invasive visual recording, according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed last week.
The affidavit said the woman was shopping at Austin Books & Comics on North Lamar Boulevard on Aug. 20 when they heard a voice directly beneath them
"When they looked down, they saw the suspect squatting behind her," the document said. "She noticed they had a cell phone in their hand, which was pointed facing up their skirt."
The affidavit said the woman confronted the man, identified in the report as Danielo B. Perez, and told them that what they were doing was disgusting, and that they should be ashamed of himself.
The woman told their fiancé what happened, and they also confronted the man.
The affidavit said Perez apologized to the woman's fiancé, told them they deleted the images and "not to worry about it."
The document said Perez admitted to taking the photos in an interview with authorities after the incident.
"The suspect admitted to their actions and apologized for them," the document said. "He further stated they wanted all of this to ‘just go away, like everyone to just move on, put it behind us and everyone moves on with their life'. They also stated that this would ruin them and that they no longer had the images."
The affidavit said surveillance footage from the store showed Perez kneeling behind the victim with a cell phone in their left hand.
Invasive visual recording is a state jail felony punishable by up to two years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000.
Authorities said Perez had not been booked into the Travis County Jail by 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday.

Rules of Badminton
Below is a brief summary on the rules of the game, for a full and complete version of the I.B.F. (International Badminton Federation) rules please see http://www.worldbadminton.com/ibf_laws.html.
Badminton is a game between two players or a team of doubles hitting a light, feathered shuttlecock with a racquet over a central net. Only the serving side can score a point, while the receiving side is trying to win the right to serve the following point.
A badminton match is played as the best-of-three games. In doubles and singles, the first side to score 15 points wins the game.
A coin toss decides who is to serve first and which side of the net a player will initially defend.
Service
The shuttle must be hit below the server's waist with the racquet head below the server's hand, and the server must have part of both feet stationary in contact with the ground. The shuttle then must fall within the receiver's service court to be deemed legal.
General play
Once the shuttle is in play, the point continues with players attempting to hit the shuttle back and forth across the net. A side wins the rally by hitting the shuttle to the floor on the opponent's side of or if the opponent fails to keep the shuttle in play.
The shuttle is declared out of play if it fails to cross the net, lands out of the court or hits the ceiling of the venue.
A rally is also lost if a fault is committed. A fault is called if a player touches the net during play with either body or racquet, hits the shuttle before it comes across the net or is hit by the shuttle.
Other rules
A shuttle that lands on a line is in bounds.
A player may let their racquet cross over the net in their or their follow-through on a shot.
A shuttle may hit the net on a serve as long as it then lands within the opponent's service court, otherwise it is a fault.
If a shuttle should get caught on top of the net or in the net, having passed over the net during play, a let is called and the rally replayed, except on service when a fault is called.
A fault is called if a player swings and misses while serving.
Players are guilty of a fault if they deliberately distract an opponent by shouting or making gestures.
An interval of 90 seconds is allowed between each game.
Court
A badminton court is a rectangle 13.4-metres long and 5.18-metres wide for singles, extended on each side with 42-centimetre alleys for doubles (making the doubles court 13.4m x 6.1m). It is divided into two equal sections by the net, 155cm high at the posts at either side and dipping to 152.4cm in the centre.
The shuttle
The shuttle consists of a rounded cork base covered in a thin layer of leather. Sixteen goose feathers are attached to this base. Each shuttle requires three birds because a wing has six feathers and manufacturers cannot mix those from left and right wings, because they have different curvatures. Most high-quality shuttles tend to use feathers from the left wing of the bird, considered stronger. Note: all the feathers come from birds that have been raised for food.
The length of the shuttle may vary between 64 to 70 millimeters, provided that all feathers are equal length. Each shuttle should weigh between 4.74 and 5.5 grams.
The racquet
A badminton racquet may be up to 68cm long and 23cm wide, with a head up to 29cm long.

President Obama on Friday once again called on Congress to pass legislation to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling and further burdening the country's students.
Legislation passed last year set subsidized Stafford Loan rates at 3.4%, but that deal expires on July 1. If Congress and the president can't agree on a plan before then, rates will double to 6.8%.
“Higher education cannot be a luxury for a privileged few,” the president said, while flanked by college students in a Rose Garden address.
The average student borrower would have to pay $1,000 more next year if loan rates were to double, according to the White House's estimate. But while Washington battles over the best way to rescue students from that additional burden, little is being done regarding the $26,000 which the average recent graduate already owes.
The president themselves noted the “déjà vu” of the political fight over student loans, which resulted in the partisan showdown around the same time last year–months before the 2012 election.
Obama also denounced the new GOP House plan passed last week, which would set the new interest rate at 5% and link it to the variable rate on 10-year Treasury bonds. That legislation “fails the test,” because it would not keep the loan rate locked in at 3.4% for the remainder of the year, they said. Furthermore, it could wind up costing students even more in the long run.
“The House bill isn't smart and it's not fair,” they said. “I'm glad the House is paying attention to it, but they didn't do it in the right way.”
But the band-aids proposed by Democrats and Republicans alike might only make things worse in the long run, according to The Century Foundation's Ben Landy.
“[N]either the president's nor the Republican plan are a good deal for students in the long run,” Landy told msnbc via email. That's because both plans rely on a basic philosophy of “tying the educational and financial futures of our youngest and most vulnerable generation to the volatility of the ‘free market.'”
Instead of using a variable rate, the most recent White House budget includes a provision to set the fixed interest rate annually. This new fixed rate would also be based on the interest rate of 10-year Treasury bonds, but for at least the first year the rates for subsidized loans would stay at 3%. Because the White House plan does not include a cap on how high interest rates could go, five groups representing young voters—including the National Campus Leadership Council and Rock the Vote—released a joint statement condemning the plan in April.
“Students have never taken out federal student loans without a cap on how high interest can go,” they said in the joint statement. “The President stood with us by investing in higher education during their first term, and we're concerned that their budget does not deliver the same investment this time around.”
Responding to the president's Friday speech, House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement that there was plenty of room for compromise between the White House and Congress.
“The differences between the House plan and the president's are small, and there's no reason they cannot be overcome quickly,” the Ohio Republican said. “But today, rather than working to resolve the issue, the president resorted to a campaign stunt to try to score political points.”
If this all sounds vaguely familiar, it's because Washington had a similar fight last year. That was when Congress first extended the law which keeps student loan rates fixed at 3.4%, after President Obama made an issue of it during the 2012 campaign. Though that law did lighten students' debt burden a bit, it did little to slow the years-long explosion in student debt. This year, total student debt passed the $1 trillion milestone.
The massive debt burden a generation that is “not able to participate in consumer society in the way we've seen in previous generations,” said Landy in a separate phone interview. This creates a “sort of drain or drag on the economy.”
“They're not being cars, they're credit rating is so bad that they can't do the things they want to … they're not starting families, they're not starting businesses,” they said.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has proposed a third piece of legislation to deal with federal student loan rates. Called the Bank on Students Loan Fairness Act, their bill would force the government to loan to students at the same rate that the Federal Reserve loans to banks: A rate currently as low as 0.75%.
There's nothing like a practical example for learning a skill. So here's a little example of how to take a story and then carefully apply journalistic skill and judgement to make it into one of those proper stories they put in newspapers. Or something like that 🙂
The core of the story is this: child climbs up tree, child climbs down tree, stranger walks up to child, school staff walk up to stranger, stranger walks off, police have a word with stranger.
Fact 1: “At no point was any child ever stuck in a tree”.
How do you report this? Easy:
TEACHERS LEAVE BOY OF 5 STUCK UP A TREE (Express)
A FIVE-YEAR-OLD pupil was left stuck up a tree (Sun)
They spotted the stuck five-year-old at Manor School in Melksham, Wiltshire (Metro)
TEACHERS refused to rescue a five-year-old boy stuck up a tree (Daily Star)
Fact 2: The child was in the tree for no more than “ten minutes”.
How do you report this? Easy:
Half an hour (Daily Star)
45 minutes (The Guardian) [Update: as pointed out in the comment, the Guardian (now) also gives the school saying it was “less than 10”]
At least 45 minutes (Telegraph)
Nearly an hour (Express)
Fact 3: Because no child was stuck, there was no child to rescue.
How do you report this? Easy:
Teachers leave boy, 5, stranded in tree because of health and safety (Daily Mail)
A DAREDEVIL five-year-old boy who got stuck up a tree at school had to stay there for nearly an hour – because health and safety rules banned teachers from rescuing them (Express)
A FIVE-YEAR-OLD pupil was left stuck up a tree at school because a bizarre health and safety policy BANNED teachers from helping them (The Sun)
TEACHERS refused to rescue a five-year-old boy stuck up a tree because of daft health and safety rules (Daily Star)
Fact 4: A stranger walked up to the tree, by which time “the child was standing on the path, having exited the tree” on their own.
How do you report this? Easy:
The boy was only rescued after 45 minutes in the tree when passer-by Kim Barrett, 38, noticed the child and helped them down themselves (Daily Mail)
The child was only rescued when a woman noticed them and helped them down themselves (The Sun)
The stranded pupil was finally rescued from the 20ft tree when passerby Kim Barrett spotted their plight and helped them down (Express)
They came to the aid of a five-year-old boy who had been left on their own in a tree (Telegraph)
Fact 5: The child's mother says, “I am amazed at the gullibility of the press and some of the general public. My child was never stuck in a tree and was very unhappy about a stranger approaching them in their school … The staff were doing their job and were fully aware that my son was there. They were also aware that a stranger was approaching him. They intercepted them to ensure there was no possibility of my son being removed from the premises.”
How do you report this? Easy:
Err, you don't.

Sometimes, the Internet has a funny way of acting like a giant game of telephone. That's what happened last week when a few popular sites took and ran a story on the country of Sweden being supposedly okay with people pleasuring themselves in public. It seems a few things were lost in translation.
The story began with a 65-year-old man in Sweden who was acquitted of touching themselves on a beach and then turned into an orgy of sites falling over themselves to report the Sweden's purported lax masturbation laws. "Public Masturbation Declared Legal in Sweden After Landmark Trial," blares the headline from Gawker, which got some 400,000-plus views. The Daily Mail found the story too, announcing "Swedish court rules it IS legal to masturbate in public."
That isn't exactly true. What both those sites did was run with a mistranslation of the verdict and statement from prosecutor Olof Vrethammar. Vice's Caisa Ederyd, a self-described actual "Swedish person," highlights the differences:
The English translation of Olof's quote, according to the Local: "The district court has made a judgement on this case. With that we can conclude that it is OK to masturbate on the beach. The act may be considered to be disorderly conduct." The English translation of Olof's quote, according to me, a Swedish person: "The district court has made a judgement on this particular case. Consequently, you CANNOT imply or draw a conclusion that it's OK to masturbate on a beach. This deed could possibly be considered as offensive behavior."
Though those two statements are similar, there's a big difference in what they're trying to say. And the Ederyd's take makes more sense—the first one jumps from the court being fine with a practice into a warning about disorderly conduct. Further, Ederyd asked Chief Judge Lena Egelin at Stockholm's High Court about the case. Egelin's response matches up closer to Ederyd's translation, thus revealing that this case was more an exception to the rule:
Right. So does this case with the 65-year-old masturbating on the beach change anything in Swedish law?
No, definitely not! It's always a matter of evaluation in each case. What has been discussed a lot in Sweden lately are situations where people have masturbated at home and someone has walked by their window and seen them. But in each case it's a matter of evaluation in court.
Thankfully, there are no reports of a spike in Swedish public masturbation (yet).

Editor's Note: I made a change to the article to point more toward Ace Broadcasting. Keep in mind, NO PODCAST IS GETTING SUED. Only Podcast hosting companies.
Earlier today news spread of the company that sued Apple back in 2011 is at it again. They have issued lawsuits to ACE Broadcasting and HowStuffWorks.com. While they received $8 million from Apple for a patent dispute, can they really go after a podcast?
The Lawsuit
The company Personal Audio LLC filed an Intellectual Property patent against HowStuffWorks (2:2013cv00015), Togi Entertainment (2:2013cv00013) and Ace Broadcasting Company (2:2013cv00014) – the official company of the Adam Carolla podcast. All of these cases were filed Jan 7th at Texas Eastern District Court.
What Carolla and HowStuffWorks are being Sued for
The three sites are being sued for a patent infringement held by Personal Audio LLC – created by Jim Logan, Dan Goessling and Charles Call. The patent – 8,112,504 “System for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence” which were filed in 2009 and given patent on Feb 7, 2012.
Wait – February 7th 2012?
Yes. These are based on patents that were filed for radio or television in 1996. The company itself filed for LLC before they went after companies – assuming they wanted personal protection so they wouldn't lose their houses if they lost.
Other Lawsuits of Personal Audio LLC
Personal Audio also has sued Apple, Sirus XM Radio, Coby Electronics and Archos. The company has sued Apple a series of four times. They sued Samsung, RIM, Motorola Mobility, HTC and LG.
There is also a lawsuit against Amazon Digital Services.
The company is definitely going after the way podcasters are pushing content. So far they have received over 8 million from Apple from patents.
The company – who claims they are pioneers of playlists & podcasting – has licensed their technology with many of the companies they sued.
What Does that Mean for Podcasting?
Nothing for now. These patents are more for segment podcasting and being able to navigate through shows. Podcasts themselves are not at risk at this time.
So go ahead and continue to podcast!!

Although neo-con con artists and right-wing opportunists in this country are doing their best to pour fire on, to mix a couple of metaphors, the Iranian powder keg-- positively gleeful at the prospects of spilling innocent blood, of whomever, and of embarrassing President Obama for their cautious, diplomatic reaction -- even solid conservatives like George Will and Dick Lugar were repulsed yesterday when extremists in the GOP started howling for "regime change." Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was especiallyinflammatory and sure to cause grief to the Iranian patriots struggling against a brutal and paranoid regime increasingly prepared to shoot down its own citizens. Florida's extreme right Senate candidate, Marco Rubio, looked at the troubles there as an opportunity to endear themselves to the NRA and to suggest that Iranians ignore Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King and turn to violence (something all hard right Republicans love ), exactly the kind of excuse that could save the tottering fascist regime.Yesterday as the rift within the ruling elite grew even wider, 5 members of ex-President Hashemi Rafsanjani's family, including their 46 year old daughter Faezeh, were arrested and taken into custody (and then released), a clear warning to the senior ayatollah and Chairman of the Assembly of Experts to not make a move against the Supreme Leader, which the Iranian Constitution empowers the Assembly of Experts to do.The protests, which started out as a demand for new elections by middle class Iranians in North Tehran has started spreading to labor unions and has split the political and religious elites. Yesterday Ali Larijani, the speaker of Iran's Parliament and no reformer, urged the Guardian Council to "thoroughly" investigate complaints about the election and said that "a majority of people are of the opinion that the actual election result is different from what was officially announced." At the same time they denounced interference in domestic Iranian politics by the U.S., Britain, France and Germany. The military appears firmly behind the Khamenei-Ahmadinejad clique. The acting head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Gholam Ali Rashid, came down on Mousavi like a ton of bricks yesterday: "We are determined to confront plots by enemies aimed at creating a rift in the nation."This week,Magazine has a good analysis of the Iranian political system and a who's who for beginners. They make the point that "the conflict in Iran thus far has been not so much a wholesale revolt of the masses against the system, as it is a complex struggle for power within Iran's ruling establishment, and a battle over the country's direction." Here's how they rate 'em:1- Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader for the last 2 decades. "Lacking the charisma, religious rank and founding-father prestige of their predecessor, they sought to bolster their authority by supporting radical Islamic causes and appearing as the avuncular head of the Iranian family."2- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a radical right populist-- their version of a teabagger-- who won the presidency in 2005, "styling themselves as a populist champion of the little guy against a corrupt establishment, and as a nationalist who flexes Iran's muscle on the world stage... close to the powerful, shadowy political factions and security organizations behind Iran's Supreme Leader."3- Mir Hossein Mousavi, a former prime minister who has never shown much inclination towards reform until now. He's "promising greater democracy and sober economic management in Iran, and improved relations with the West. Having mounted a remarkable challenge to Ahmadinejad's re-election, their accusation of election fraud and denunciation of 'dictatorship' represents an unprecedented challenge to the status quo by the forces of reform."4- Mohammed Khatami, a two term president who won a landslide victory in 1997 as a reformer. The Supreme Leader cracked down on their reforms big time and that is probably why they decided to steal the election for Ahmadinejad this time.5- Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, one of Iran's richest men, former speaker of parliament and two-term president, current head of the Assembly of Experts, which-- at least theoretically-- could depose Khamenei.6- Mehdi Karroubi, a former parliament speaker and the only real reformist in the presidential race.7- Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri, has greater religious authority than Khamenei. They were one of the first in the elite to denounce the election results as fraudulent and he's a believer in separation of church and state.8- Ali Larijani is the current parliament speaker, close to Khamenei but at odds with Ahmadinejad.9- Major General Mohammed Ali Jafari, head of the 300,000 strong Revolutionary Guard, "the most powerful element in the regime's security forces, running everything from the country's missile systems to the basij militia, whose hundreds of thousands of young men enforce domestic order and have been at the forefront off attacks against those protesting the election result. Reporting to the Supreme Leader, the IRGC, is listed by the U.S. government as a terrorist organization-- and also maintains an extensive business empire in Iran.10- Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, is the radical right extremist head of the Guardian Council and a close ally of Ahmadinejad. He's in charge of looking into election fraud ; he's to Iranian politics as Ann Coulter is to American politics-- except they wield power (and never had a sex change operation).

A proposal by Vancouver's mayor to tax vacant homes is raising plenty of red flags with critics who question whether it could ever be effective.
Gregor Robertson pitched the tax earlier this week hoping to increase the number of available rental units by encouraging homeowners to put those units into the marketplace.
Coun. Melissa De Genova calls it a "knee jerk" reaction to a complex housing crisis in city with a vacancy rate of less than half a percentage point.
"He can't specify how we are going to be implementing the tax, what it is going to mean and who it is going to apply to," they noted, adding while they support the concept, the current proposal is too rushed.
Offloading to B.C. Assessment
One of the first challenges the mayor faces is determining which homes are vacant, according to Tony Gioventu, the executive director of the Condominium homeowners' Association of B.C.
"How would you identify it, and if it is vacant is there a reason why it is vacant?" they ask.
To back up their proposal Robertson's cites a city report that estimated 10,800 homes and condos are sitting empty in Vancouver.
About 90 per cent of Vancouver's vacant homes are condos or apartments, according to a recent study based on BC Hydro usage.
But for privacy reasons that study relied on data from BC Hydro that had the addresses stripped out.
So the city would need to find another way to identify the vacant properties, something Robertson acknowledged on Tuesday.
Their preferred solution is to have B.C. Assessment create a new class of property called "residential vacant" that would apply to "empty and under-occupied investment properties."
Voluntary verification or snitch lines?
A property's status would be determined each year by self-declaration, similar to the way people claim a homeowners grant.
But it's the proposal for an "audits and complaint-response" process that De Genova is concerned will turn neighbours into snitches.
"How will this affect people's privacy? Does this mean my neighbours will be spying on me if they think I am not home, if I go away for a few months?" says De Genova.
And then there are questions about what Robertson means by "empty or under-occupied homes."
A recent city report says it could include:
Owners of second homes in Vancouver who use the property occasionally.
Short-term rentals such as AirBNB.
Property occupied from time to time by family members of the owner with primary residency elsewhere.
Gioventu wonders, "What does occasionally mean?"
"We have quite a number of people who either live in Vancouver and work somewhere else. So what is a reasonable occupancy? Two days a month? Ten days a month?"
"What about people working overseas for a year or two who choose to keep their homes? ... At what point does the province or the city have the right to say what we can or cannot do with our property?" they ask.
Real estate analyst Michael Ferriera with Urban Analytics, also has concerns. They note 90 per cent of vacant units are condos or apartments owned by people who can afford to forgo rents.
"If you are wealthy enough to own a second home that's a luxury unit in Coal Harbour, I don't think that a tax is going to encourage your to add your unit to the rental pool."
"I'm not sure it will have a significant impact on affordability, which I understand is the primary reason for introducing the policy."
Can Vancouver afford to act alone?
Both the mayor and the staff at city hall who authored the report acknowledge the problems, particularly with verification, and say these are the details that just need to be worked out in the days ahead.
But despite the complexities, the mayor has only given the province 60 days to make up its mind about their proposal to use B.C. Assessment to track down the vacant units.
After that, they say, the city will go it alone. And while the province has indicated it is willing to talk about the idea, it has yet to sign on.
A recent report found Vancouver's non-occupancy rate was 4.9 per cent in 2002 compared to 4.8 per cent in 2014, putting it in line with other big Canadian cities. (Canadian Press)
So the mayor has a second proposal that won't require the province's help — a new municipal business tax on investment properties.
"In order to avoid being taxed, owners could be required to produce evidence that they are primary residents or renting the property long-term, such as government ID (i.e. a driver's licence) to substantiate primary residence or a long-term lease agreement." says the city report.
The proposal does not say how this would be done, but it does note it "will likely require significant resources to implement and administer on an ongoing basis."
Who will pay in the end?
That's another red flag for De Genova, who notes staff at city hall are already unable to keep up with the demands of regulating just 100 marijuana dispensaries under the city's new dispensary licensing system.
They say the cost of having every homeowner in the city prove they either live in their home or have a long-term lease with a tenant will be expensive to adminster.
"How are we going to ensure this is not going to cost the city and residents more money?"
Ferreira agrees the proposal may just not be worth the effort.
"If this is all about affordability, this is a little bit of a red herring. The city could have a much greater impact if it could speed up the approval process to allow more product onto the marketplace."
They say it currently takes up to three years to get a development permit approved and up to seven or eight if the lot needs rezoning.
De Genova says red-tape at city hall is already "adding $100,000 to the cost of a condo unit."
"If we really want to look at affordability, we need to start inside the city," they say.
Over at UBC's Sauder School of Business, real estate professor Tsur Somerville agrees.
"It's a good first step that would help renters," they say, "But ultimately it is not going to make Vancouver more affordable."
Uniquely for a vessel of this type, it will be common to see the jump-jet F-35B appear to land conventionally.
This is a process called Shipborne Rolling Vertical Landing. It is a process designed to land jump-jet aircraft that uses both the vertical thrust from the jet engine and lift from the wings, thus maximising the payload an aircraft can return with and stopping the financial waste that comes with dropping expensive weaponry in the sea in order to land vertically.
Another operational advantage of this technique is that it can increase the landing payload capacity of a V/STOL aircraft, which can be restricted when it lands vertically. It can also reduce the level of wear on the lift engines and extend their operational life. Similarly, it can reduce the amount of wear upon the deck surface of a carrier caused by the downward jet exhaust from vertical landings.
SRVL landing is under development for use with the F-35B when it enters service with the Royal Navy in 2018. Rolling landings will enable the F-35B to land on these carriers with an increased weapon and fuel load and will use the aircraft's computer controlled disc brakes.
The Queen Elizabeth class mark a change from expressing carrier power in terms of number of aircraft carried, to the number of sortie's that can be generated from the deck. The class are not the largest class of carrier in the world but they are most likely the smallest and least expensive carrier the Royal Navy could build which still have the advantages that large carriers offer.
Now that the UK has committed to a fleet of 138 aircraft, details on the structure of the F-35 force have been revealed.
It is expected that the UK will build a front-line fleet of 48 aircraft with each squadron having 12 jets. A fifth unit, an operational conversion unit, will also operate 12 aircraft.
The structure of the Lightning force is now somewhat clear.
17(R) Squadron is currently based at Edwards Air Force Base in the US and fills role of F-35B Operational Evaluation Unit.
617 Squadrons will be based at RAF Marham and will be the first operational British F-35 unit in 2019.
809 Naval Air Squadron will also be based at RAF Marham.
2 more unnamed frontline Squadrons are to be established.
1 Operation Conversion Squadron will also be formed.
Sea trials begin in the New Year and the vessel moves to Portsmouth in 2017.
At least one U.S. law firm is looking into bringing a class-action lawsuit against Apple over the "Error 53" issue affecting certain iPhone owners.
Seattle-based law firm PCVA is investigating a potential class-action lawsuit over the security feature that could leave some iPhone users with bricked phones, The Guardian reported. (PCVA has not responded to Mashable yet.)
The basic problem occurs if your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus home button is repaired anywhere other than an Apple Store or Apple-authorized repair center.
At first, the phone might work — with everything, including Touch ID, seeming perfectly fine.
But then, when you try to update to a newer version of iOS (or you attempt to restore your phone from a backup), the software checks to make sure the Touch ID sensor matches the rest of the hardware. If it doesn't find a match — and only authorized Apple repair centers can pair a phone and Touch ID sensor — your phone will stop functioning.
According to Apple, this is a security measure, since the company pairs the iPhone's Touch ID sensor with a specific phone and doesn't allow those sensors to work with other phones.
That's because of the sensitive nature attached to Touch ID, which includes information like your fingerprints and Apple Pay.
Last week, an Apple spokesperson told Mashable that Error 53 "is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers."
But there haven't been many details about Error 53 until now, which poses a problem for users. Even though it's a valid security measure, plenty of users left with bricked phones are angry that the only official solution is to visit an authorized Apple Store and pay for an out-of-warranty repair — which generally means replacing the phone entirely.
Repair center concerns
While most cases of Error 53 arise from getting a home button repaired at an unauthorized dealer, some reports state that a screen replacement could also trigger the error message.
The only surefire way to avoid an Error 53 bricking: only have your phone repaired at an Apple Store or at an authorized repair shop. That might be fine for users in the United States or in western Europe, but in parts of the world without Apple Stores or easy access to authorized repair centers, that can be problematic.
Moreover, official Apple repairs typically cost much more than repairs by third parties. It's this issue — that Apple may be forcing users to use its own (often more expensive) repair centers — that seems to be at the crux of a potential class-action situation.
PCVA states on its website that it believes "Apple may be intentionally forcing users to use their repair services, which cost much more than most third party repair shops. Where you could get your screen replaced by a neighborhood repair facility for $50-80, Apple charges $129 or more. There is incentive for Apple to keep end users from finding alternative methods to fix their products."
That's a criticism Apple has faced by the greater repair community as well.
Kyle Wiens, CEO of the popular website and repair guide iFixit, wrote a blog post about Error 53 last week that laid out some of their issues with it from the point of view of repair shops.
Error 53 isn't necessarily a problem of third-party parts. It can happen with new OEM parts out of a different iPhone. It's a matter of synchronization—not third-party parts. Also, a lot of people live in places where they can't just pop into an Apple Store for a repair. Because there is no Apple Store to pop into—and there is no Apple-authorized service provider within hundreds of miles. In those cases, lots of people go the DIY route, or go to a local mom-and-pop repair store.
I argued last week that a potential alternative to bricking iPhone devices with un-paired home buttons would be to disable Apple Pay and anything else associated with the secure element.
Since then, security and iOS experts pointed out that's not tenable because of how iOS works with official hardware. Without any official word from Apple, it's hard to know whether this is actually an option, but it does seem as though there could be some alternative to bricking the phone. And if that isn't an alternative on current iPhone devices, it's certainly something Apple should consider in the future.
Balancing security versus serviceability
Part of the problem with the Error 53 saga is that there's no clear answer. Fundamentally, it's a good thing that Apple is taking the proper precautions to pair the secure element and Touch ID with phones so that they cannot be swapped.
Can you imagine the outrage if a simple replacement of the home button could trigger a malicious break-in to your iPhone's secure enclave? Any company asking customers to entrust its biometric and financial data to a phone needs to be taking the proper precautions to make sure that information cannot be hacked.
Apple's network of official stores and authorized repair centers just isn't wide enough to service all users in all areas. Yes, Apple does repairs via mail, but that doesn't always cut it when you're talking about something as essential as an iPhone.
Moreover, because only authorized Apple centers can pair phones and Touch ID sensors, it really does limit how the consumer can get unbreakable phone repairs. That means if a third party did buy a genuine Apple Touch ID button, it still wouldn't be possible to repair it without risking the wrath of Error 53.
Still, I can't see Apple backing down on its commitment to device and data security — nor should it.
If there is a solution other than just going to an Apple Store, it may have to involve enacting a broader authorized third-party repair program that would let more shops and repair technicians be certified to repair Apple devices.
I think there will be a lot of people who don't realise how much larger the Powercolor card is. It's 310mm long, and would be even longer if they hadn't moved the power socket from the end to the front of the card. It will fit in my Antec 302 (the longer, wider version of the 300 case) with all of 8mm to spare.
OCUK doesn't seem to list the dimensions, I went to the Powercolour site, but OCUK should really note how long this card is if they don't want to be getting a load back because they just won't fit. The Nitro is fully 70mm shorter, which is likely going to make a massive difference in how many cases it will fit into.

Today, the United States submitted a communication to the United Nations, in its capacity as depositary for the Paris Agreement, regarding the U.S. intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as it is eligible to do so, consistent with the terms of the Agreement. As the President indicated in their June 1 announcement and subsequently, they are open to re-engaging in the Paris Agreement if the United States can identify terms that are more favorable to it, its businesses, its workers, its people, and its taxpayers.
The United States supports a balanced approach to climate policy that lowers emissions while promoting economic growth and ensuring energy security. We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions through innovation and technology breakthroughs, and work with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in many nationally determined contributions.
The United States will continue to participate in international climate change negotiations and meetings, including the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP-23) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, to protect U.S. interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration. Such participation will include ongoing negotiations related to guidance for implementing the Paris Agreement.

David Cameron is committed to “breaking the link” between the European court of human rights and the supreme court to ensure the UK's highest court remains the “ultimate arbiter of human rights”, Downing Street has said.
The prime minister's spokesperson moved to clarify No 10's thinking amid reports that Cameron had ruled out a UK withdrawal from the European convention on human rights.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that the prime minister had overridden objections from Michael Gove and Theresa May, who believe that pulling out of the convention may be the “only solution” to assert the supremacy of UK courts over the Strasbourg-based court.
Downing Street said the prime minister remains committed to two goals outlined in the Conservative general election manifesto: scrapping the Human Rights Act and ensuring that the UK supreme court would have the ultimate say over human rights in the UK.
The No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister's position on what needs to happen on human rights is set out very clearly in the Conservative manifesto. That is the approach that the whole government is behind. That is scrapping the Human Rights Act, breaking the link between the ECHR and here, and making the supreme court in the UK the ultimate arbiter of human rights in the UK.
“The prime minister's focus here is on getting the rights put into a British bill of rights and making the supreme court, not the Strasbourg court, the one that decides on human rights in the UK ... The justice secretary is looking through these issues and working out the best way to take them forward.”
Gove has been forced to delay plans to scrap the Human Rights Act after it became clear to government whips that they would be overwhelmed by a Tory rebellion. The prime minister has been advised that they need to abandon a “deeply offensive” threat to withdraw from the European convention on human rights if they are to win support of David Davis and Ken Clarke for their plans to repeal the Human Rights Act.
Senior Tories have told No 10 that Gove will have to embark on a major revision of Tory plans, outlined last year by their predecessor, Chris Grayling, to withdraw from the convention if parliament failed to secure the right to veto judgments from the European court of human rights. Gove is making clear that they regard the Grayling document as a starting point but is not bound by it. But they are saying they are bound by the Conservative general election manifesto.
The Tory manifesto said: “The next Conservative government will scrap the Human Rights Act, and introduce a British Bill of Rights. This will break the formal link between British courts and the European court of human rights, and make our own supreme court the ultimate arbiter of human rights matters in the UK.”
The European court of human rights upholds the European convention on human rights, which was drawn up in the wake of the second world war. David Maxwell-Fyfe, who later became lord chancellor, was one of the main authors of the convention.
The reports about the splits in government over Britain's membership of the convention came after Nick Timothy, a former special adviser to the home secretary, called for a withdrawal from the convention.
Timothy wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: “A new bill of rights that incorporates all the original articles of the European convention – together with other traditional British rights such as the right to a trial by jury – would still be consistent with the Good Friday agreement. It would also allow parliament – rather than Strasbourg – to decide where the balance lies between different rights. It would allow British courts and British judges to decide where the balance lies between those rights in individual cases. It would mean the UK can protect the public and national security while still defending human rights. And it would mean we can escape what has become a de facto European constitutional court: the UK should withdraw from the European convention and the jurisdiction of the court in Strasbourg.”
Dominic Cummings, Gove's former special adviser, blogged in response to the Daily Telegraph story: “The No 10 line that ‘Gove hasn't made up their mind yet' doesn't make sense. Obviously only the prime minister can decide whether to withdraw from an international treaty, as removing the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg court requires. Gove's job on the HRA is to punt it into the long grass then deliver a fudge that leaves Strasbourg in charge. The sensible thing for them to do is give this doomed project to a junior minister and focus on other priorities.”
Ms. Rousseff does appear to be paying the price for their lack of political experience and skills. An economist by training, they had never held elected public office, serving only in state and federal cabinet posts before Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, their predecessor, chose them as the Workers Party standard-bearer in the 2010 election. Aided by their popularity, they won handily.
At the peak of the protests last month, Ms. Rousseff made a point of turning to Mr. da Silva, a master of political maneuvering, for advice. But instead of having them fly to Brasília to confer with her, or talking quietly by telephone, they went to meet them on their home turf in São Paulo, leaving the impression among many Brazilians that they were not in charge and they were still pulling the strings.
When they spoke again, they went to Brasília. But unhappiness within the Workers Party, including among members of Congress worried about their own survival in next year's elections, has fueled speculation in the news media and discussion in the party about Mr. da Silva possibly returning as the party's candidate if Ms. Rousseff's downward spiral continued.
“She's a good head of government and a good administrator, but now they also have to assume the role of leader, and that's the difficult part,” said Jorge Viana, a senator who is a member of the Workers Party and a supporter of the president. “That's where we've felt the absence of Lula, because Lula is a great leader, with fantastic instincts and a sensitivity for dialogue.”
Ms. Rousseff has had no better luck dealing with the clamor for a political housecleaning than they have had with social demands. In response to public disgust with a political system seen as corrupt and unresponsive — an opinion shared by 81 percent of respondents in a poll published late last month by Datafolha, a leading Brazilian research company — they have offered one ill-fated proposal after another.
After their original idea of a constitutional assembly met with immediate resistance, for example, Ms. Rousseff embraced the idea of a plebiscite. But Congress voted down that proposal last week, in part because of concerns that it would be unconstitutional in the form their government was offering it.
Now Ms. Rousseff and their staff are pushing for legislators to pass a hastily assembled political overhaul package, one version or another of which has been languishing in Congress since the mid-1990s. But the opposition, the news media and the public seem suspicious of the initiative, which is seen by some critics as an attempt by the Workers Party to create conditions that would allow it to remain in power permanently.
Dubious game developers and Twitter trolls will now have to look elsewhere for backup when it comes to telling us “SJWs” that there's nothing wrong with the portrayal of women in video games. A survey found that most teenage boys—despite common wisdom to the contrary—don't want women to be over-sexualized in their video games.
I'll let you take a minute to readjust your entire worldview.
Frequently, when people (frequently us) complain that women in video games are heavily subjected to the male gaze to the point where it becomes harmful, a defense that crops up is, “But our audience for this product is young men/teenage boys. We're just playing to our audience.” Setting aside how silly it is to purposefully target a potentially gender-neutral product specifically at one gender—and how deciding that certain things are “for girls” and “for boys” is a problem all in itself—that's making a pretty big assumption about what that audience even wants. And it turns out the assumption is certainly making an ass out of someone.
In a survey of 1,400 middle and high school students by Rosalind Wiseman, Charlie Kuhn, and Ashly Burch, of Hey Ash Whatcha Playin'?, it turned out that of boys who identified as gamers, 55% said games should have more women as protagonists, and 57% felt women were treated as sex objects too often in games. Teenage boys. So all the grown-ass men on the Internet screaming about their toys being taken away just because we'd like a bit more consideration shown toward women in games might want to take a step back and realize they could get a lesson in maturity from teenagers.
Wiseman shared some more interesting statistics from the survey on Time, writing,
Both boys and girls aren't more likely to play a game based on the gender of the protagonist 70% of girls said it doesn't matter and 78% of boys said it doesn't matter. Interestingly, boys care less about playing as a male character as they age and girls care more about playing as a female one.
They also noted that their results showed girls play a variety of different game genres, whether or not some people want to believe that over half of gamers being women is only because of all our moms playing Farmville—as though that somehow make them lesser gamers anyway. The group behind the survey has stressed that it was only intended to be exploratory and not a completely thorough evaluation, but the findings are pretty encouraging.
Maybe there is hope for the next generation of gamers after all.

The Bureau, in collaboration with the Financial Times, has created the only comprehensive database tracking every penny distributed through the EU's Structural Funds to date.
As Europeans face the uncertainty of swingeing government cuts, the European Union continues to spend. Its structural fund programme distributes €347bn of European taxpayers' money across 271 regions in 27 countries.
Yet a web of bureaucracy has hidden this spending. Even MEPs have not had a truly transparent view of the organisations getting the funds.
Over eight months the Bureau and the FT have collected data relating to billions of euros to reveal, for the first time, the 646,000 recipients that have received the funds.
Our research reveals:
How Italy's most dangerous mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, has become an expert at getting its hands on these funds
A decentralised, cumbersome and weak system allows, and rarely punishes, fraud and misuse
Millions of euros are going to multinational companies to help them move factories within the union despite guidelines discouraging this practice
Funds have been used to finance a hotel building boom on protected nature reserves in Spain
The lack of thorough checks means money is being wasted
Some of the world's largest companies are receiving funding despite the programme being aimed at small and medium-sized companies
The Structural Funds make up the EU's second biggest budget after the Common Agricultural funding programme.
The aim of the structural funds is to redistribute Europe's wealth and lift the economies of its poorest regions.
From the thousands of kilometres of roads they drive on to the museums they visit, even the fitness classes they attend, millions of Europeans are benefiting from the programme.
But when Europe is experiencing the worst economic crisis in decades, drastic government cutbacks have led to riots on the streets in several member states – now more than ever taxpayers need to know that their money is being well spent.
The EU does not have to cutback. Its budget is set in stone. Indeed, it is even trying to persuade national governments to pay more into the EU budget.
The debate has also begun in Brussels to reform these funds. We want this database to inform that debate by allowing the decision makers to see for themselves exactly where the money is going.
And with only 25 anti-fraud investigators and a web of bureaucracy so dense that it is almost impossible to track how the money is being distributed, billions are being wasted and lost to fraud.
The problem is that the money is handed over to the regions, and from then on the trail has been opaque. But now with the Bureau's and FT's database it is possible to search on a sector – hotels for example, to see which organisations have been allocated funding.
In creating the database we have gone further than any Brussels bureaucrat to shine a spotlight on how the EU is spending this taxpayers' money.
The effort required to collate all the information was considerable. It involved downloading data from more than 100 websites of national and regional bodies that administer the funds, and captured in nearly 600 different files. This took months to complete.
The database documents some 646,929 recipients in every member state during the current 2007-2013 spending round.
We are now, in late 2010, halfway through the current spending round, and the database shows how funds have been allocated up to this time.
We then went further to find out exactly how the money is being spent on the ground, and this has produced a series of films and news pieces.
Over the next few days the Bureau together with a group of international collaborators will release a number of stories resulting from the data.
The Financial Times will begin five days of coverage on November 30. Al Jazeera, BBC Radio 4 File-on-Four, BBC World Service and France 2 will also broadcast programmes based on our research.
Denuvo markets themselves as the “#1 application protection and Anti-Piracy Technology” in the world. Their aim is to “provide the longest crack-free release window compared to competitors,” protecting new games from hacking and piracy during their opening weeks and months, when sales are arguably most important and piracy is likely to have the biggest impact.
A recent EU report concluded that piracy actually increases videogame sales.
A year or two ago, Denuvo delivered on that promise. Their anti-tamper protection was so watertight that piracy groups were abandoning the scene, finding it impossible to crack Just Cause 3 quickly enough to remain relevant. For a while, Denuvo's Anti-Tamper technology was doing exactly what the company hoped. As Denuvo's sales and marketing director Thomas Goebl told us last year, that's not stopping the pirates forever, but “to help publishers to secure the initial sales windows of their games, hence delaying piracy.”
In late 2015 to early 2016, Denuvo were delaying the work of pirates by weeks or months as they tried to get into games like FIFA 15, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and Lords of the Fallen. When Doom was released in May 2016, the anti-tamper technology was eventually removed from the game after it held up for four months, which Denuvo's co-founder Robert Hernandez told Kotaku was “an impressive accomplishment for such a high-profile game.”
Since that time, however, the amount of time taken to crack a game using Denuvo has been falling. Resident Evil 7 was cracked within seven days of release, and in recent weeks, the time it has taken for Denuvo to be ‘beaten' has fallen to mere days. On some occasions, workarounds have been available within hours of release; Middle-earth: Shadow of War was available inside 24 hours, as was Total War: Warhammer 2.
Pirates have been able to crack Denuvo so much faster because they have developed a new method of attack. Previously, games were cracked by a process of reverse engineering – reversing an executable, before modifying the game's code to allow you to bypass, delete, or emulate DRM. Denuvo's tech made that approach nearly impossible to achieve within a time frame short enough to be worthwhile for piracy groups.
A scene member who goes by the moniker Voksi told us that “[piracy] scene groups have found a way to get past [Denuvo's] encryption and keygen files in just a day. They do not crack Denuvo, they simply keygen it, so Denuvo thinks nothing is wrong on the pirated version.” What that means is groups have found a means to replicate Denuvo-sanctioned keys for games, which can be churned out within hours of the game's release, with little opportunity for Denuvo to fight back.
Despite its period of unparalleled success 18 months ago, Denuvo is facing obsolescence if it cannot dramatically change its approach to protection, which is why Ubisoft brought in a second level of protection intended to defend Denuvo itself with Assassin's Creed Origins. The mod team on the Crackwatch subreddit told us that “we would say that the scene groups have figured out Denuvo and that their incremental patches might only distract them for a few days until they worked around those as well. In that case, unless there's fundamental change in the way Denuvo works, which is not going to happen anytime soon, given that it took Denuvo months to upgrade from version three to version four, Denuvo protected games will continue to get cracked faster and faster.”
We reached out to Denuvo multiple times for comment on this story, but received no response. We also contacted representatives from Monolith, Bethesda, Creative Assembly, High Voltage, Respawn, Io Interactive, and Neopica, but they either did not respond, or declined to comment.
The Interior Department on Wednesday made 2.6 million acres of potentially oil-rich territory in northern Alaska available for energy exploration. At the same time, it deferred for a decade any decision to open 600,000 acres of land north of Teshekpuk Lake that is the summer home of thousands of migrating caribou and millions of waterfowl.
The decision will open up for drilling much of the northeast section of the Northeast National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, holding an estimated 3.7 billion barrels of oil, Tom Lonnie, Alaska state director for the Bureau of Land Management, said in a conference call with reporters.
The northeast and northwest portions of the reserve could yield eight billion barrels of oil, they said.
Mr. Lonnie said they expected the first oil production to begin in the easternmost part of the reserve, west of the Colville River, from 2010 to 2012. A fully developed oil complex exists on state lands on the eastern banks of the river.

The bureau has already leased out 965,000 acres of the petroleum reserve lands.
Stan Senner, executive director of Audubon Alaska, applauded the decision not to drill north of Teshekpuk, near Beaufort Sea, saying that it “acknowledges the international importance of the Teshekpuk wetlands, which have been protected by every federal administration since Jimmy Carter.” Ideally, they added, these areas will be permanently protected.
Aside from the prospect of expanding domestic oil supplies, the new production would help alleviate worries about the viability of the Alaska pipeline system.
Donald Trump is now within 3 points of Hillary Clinton in the latest Reuters presidential poll.
This comes after new allegations of Hillary Clinton's criminal activity.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made up significant ground against Hillary Clinton in the past few days in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, where they trailed by 12 points on Tuesday, 45% -33% , but is now behind only 5 points, 41% -36% .
When four candidates are included in the poll — taking in Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Gary Johnson — Clinton's lead narrows to just 3 points, 39% -36% — a statistical dead heat, given the poll's margin of error of 3 points.
The poll was taken Aug. 22-25, over a period where Clinton accused Trump of aligning with the Ku Klux Klan and the “alt-right.” The same period also saw new revelations of pay-to-play corruption while Clinton was at the State Department.
A protein that regulates memory may prove to be a therapeutic target for dementia and memory loss.
This acrylic on canvas artwork is an artistic interpretation of dynamic chromatin regulation in memory formation. Histones are the chief protein components of chromatin, which is a complex of molecules consisting of DNA and protein found in cells. The artist is the study's senior author, J. David Sweatt, Ph.D.Researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham report the discovery of a novel mechanism in the brain involved in the formation of memory and learning. In findings reported online this week in Nature, the research team describes the role of a histone subunit known as H2A.Z.
The discovery could have therapeutic ramifications for conditions including dementia, age-related memory loss or even post-traumatic stress disorder.
Histones are proteins that help regulate 24-hour memory formation in the hippocampus as well as longer memory formation in the cortex. The UAB study of the subunit H2A.Z in mice was the first done in a complex mammalian model. Previous studies had been done only in simple cells such as yeast.
Histones band together in groups of eight to form a core protein required for memory formation. In a healthy individual, the histone subunit H2A.Z is not part of the core protein, but is exchanged for — or replaces — one of the other eight core histones at the time a memory is laid down in the hippocampus.
The UAB research team, led by J. David Sweatt, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Neurobiology and director of the Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, removed H2A.Z in mouse models by means of a genetically engineered virus so that the subunit exchange could not take place. The mice then underwent threat recognition training, which allowed researchers to measure their memory response to a perceived threat over a 24-hour period.
To their surprise, memory improved in the animal models in which the H2A.Z exchange had not taken place.
“Memory improved with the absence of H2A.Z, which was unexpected, since we hypothesized that H2A.Z would be a necessary part of memory formation in normal situations,” Sweatt said. “This gives us an intriguing new target for therapies for conditions involving memory loss or poor memory formation.”
Sweatt says one possible next step would be the development of H2A.Z inhibitors that might be beneficial in cases of declining memory associated with aging or dementia. Other applications might include memory impairment related to intellectual disability.
The discovery that memory improved in the absence of H2A.Z, thought to be an integral part of memory formation, does beg the question of H2A.Z's responsibilities for normal memory formation. Sweatt speculates that H2A.Z plays a role in modulating memory, serving as a sort of memory suppressor in cases of unpleasant or painful memories.
“It may be that its role is a type of buffer, to dampen negative memories so that they don't overwhelm us or lead to additional health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder,” Sweatt suggested. “In that eventuality, the ability to either inhibit or promote H2A.Z may play a valuable role in blocking or treating PTSD in the aftermath of traumatic experiences.”
Funding for the study was provided by the McKnight Brain Research Foundation, the National Institute for Mental Health and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
The Chicago Cubs famously went 108 years without winning a world series until they finally came back from a 3–1 series to beat the Cleveland Indians in October 2016. They inhabit one of the largest markets in the United States and have money to spend every year on talent. Despite 108 years of underperformance, the Cubs still manage to have one of the most passionate fan bases in the league. How do some teams cultivate such high fan loyalty with poor on-field performance? With 30 MLB teams, 29 teams (96.6%) will not win a World Series this year. Half of the teams will even have a winning record. With 50% or more of their games ending in a loss, how do losing professional baseball, football, and basketball teams keep fans and make a profit? If we isolate winning strategies used in professional sports to turn maintain fans, how can we apply the same principles in our businesses and brands?
In each league (MLB, NFL, and NBA) there are teams that have never won a championship. Many haves had special seasons and even made it to the final game of the year. Here is a list of those teams in each league that are perpetual losers:
NFL (13 teams)
Tennessee Titans
San Diego (Los Angeles) Chargers
Philadelphia Eagles
Minnesota Vikings
Jacksonville Jaguars
Houston Texans
Detroit Lions
Cleveland Browns
Cincinnati Bengals
Carolina Panthers
Buffalo Bills
Atlanta Falcons
Arizona Cardinals
MLB (8 teams)
San Diego Padres
Tampa Bay Rays
Washington Nationals
Houston Astros
Colorado Rockies
Milwaukee Brewers
Seattle Mariners
Texas Rangers
NBA (12 teams)
Charlotte Hornets
New Orleans Pelicans
Los Angeles Clippers
Minnesota Timberwolves
Brooklyn Nets
Indiana Pacers
Utah Jazz
Toronto Raptors
Phoenix Suns
Memphis Grizzlies
Denver Nuggets
Orlando Magic
Many of these 33 professional sports teams still maintain rabid fans that constantly are looking forward to next season as their team is dropped from the playoff race on a yearly basis. That doesn't mean that all losing teams are able to weather the storm. In the last 12 months, we have seen two underperforming NFL teams change home cities due in part to low ticket sales and fan excitement. Both the San Diego Chargers and St. Louis Rams have moved to Los Angeles in hope of finding more fans in a larger market.
I've sat in stadiums, baseball fields, and arenas and watched as time expired and my team had the lesser of two scores. I've felt the pain of losing and have also on rare occasions experienced what it feels like to when The Big One. Here are some of my thoughts as to why I keep coming back to those teams that have never won the last game of the season…
The Game Experience
Those sports team that are succeeding immerse fans into a well planned and thought out experience. By heightening the event from a 60-minute game to a 3-hour experience full of music, food, chants, excitement, story, heroes, mascots, rituals it becomes more than just a game. Winning — while important to any fan — does not have to happen in order to ensure a good experience for the fans.
“Sensory branding is a type of marketing that appeals to all the senses in relation to the brand. It uses the senses to relate with customers on an emotional level. Brands can forge emotional associations in the customers' minds by appealing to their senses. A multi-sensory brand experience generates certain beliefs, feelings, thoughts and opinions to create a brand image in the consumer's mind.” A great sports experience stimulates all five senses. By immersing the fans in such a rich experience, the outcome of the game because less important to the overall experience. The sound of a chant. The taste of a hotdog. The look of the home team uniforms. The smell of popcorn. The feel of a jersey. These all combine to create a connection to the game that is bigger than simply watching it on television.
When customers enter your store or office, how do you make their experience special and worth remembering? When they open your product what do they feel? How have you designed your client experience to trigger your customer's emotions?
Lead A Community
One of the more successful sports franchises in the US is Seattle's professional soccer team The Sounders. The ownership of The Sounders understood that the connection to the fans was important. Drew Carey, part owner in the Sounders, helped set up the Alliance Council which has direct contact with team ownership, meeting 3–4 times a year. They even have voting rights on whether or not the General Manager keep their job. By empowering the fans of The Sounders they have spread responsibility for the success to the fans.
Dealing with Adversity
Being a fan of the Utah Jazz has had a real impact on my character. Every season for the last twenty years I've repeatedly learned to deal with adversity. At first adversity was known as Magic, then Michael, then Kobe, and now it's called Stephen. The Jazz went to the finals with Karl Malone and John Stockton in 1997 and 1998. Teams feared playing the Jazz for fifteen years. They were one of the strongest teams in the NBA and continually making it deep into the playoffs. Yet even the Jazz failed to win a championship. The two years they played in the finals they competed against Michael Jordan and the Bulls. It was Michael in their prime. The best player ever during their best years ever. Talk about bad luck. I still think those Jazz teams of the late nighties are among the best teams of all time though they didn't come home with any rings. As a kid, to see Karl and John come home from those series without a ring and still hold their heads high taught me something about adversity. I became a fan not because they won, but because of how they acted when they didn't win.
Celebrating Hard Work
Outside the sports world, it's pretty hard to have such clearly defined “wins” and “losses.” Things tend to be a bit more gray. Landing a sales appointment is good, but landing the client might take months more work. Even if you land a client, only time will tell if they are profitable to your company. In baseball, there are 162 games played over a six-month period that lead to the playoffs. Losing or winning a game doesn't appear to make a huge dent in a team's record. It takes a long, consistent season of slowly compiled wins until a team can reflect on the work they have done. In October, only one team wins the World Series yet it's possible to celebrate all the hard work, team effort, and individual accomplishments. In life, sometimes we have to work as hard as we can and hope luck is in our favor. If not, congratulate our competition and look forward to our next challenge.
Hope
Sports seasons always come to a close. That means there is always a new beginning the next year. They instill in us a hope that the future is brighter. However painful this last season was, next year could be the special year. And for the winners, it builds a humility knowing that next season they will start 0–0 just like the rest of the teams. Everything that goes up eventually must come down.
Melbourne's ‘Big Three' have got to slow down someday right? I mean we have been saying they have to since 2013, so they have to sometime, right? The short answer is no, they won't.
The Melbourne Storm once again defied expectations in 2015, finishing in the top four when many expected them to start sliding down towards the bottom eight.
What was hilarious was they lost to teams coming last on the ladder a lot. They lost to the last placed Manly twice in Rounds 2 and 8, they lost to the last placed Cowboys in Round 4 and they managed to lose to the eventual wooden spooners the Knights in Round 24.

But despite those losses they managed to secure fourth spot, upsetting the Roosters in the first week of the finals before being annihilated by eventual premiers the Cowboys in the qualifying finals.
Melbourne come into 2016 with a very similar side. Their big losses have been Ryan Hinchcliffe, Kurt Mann, Mahe Fonua and Matt Duffie. Their gains, however, have been Matthew White, Curtis Scott and Cheyse Blair. These are all stereotypical Craig Bellamy signings.
Will Melbourne be able to keep their run to the finals up on the back of the Big Three? Or will they finally show signs of ageing and miss the eight for the first time since 2010 (and that was due to cheating the cap)?
1. Billy Slater
2. Marika Koroibete
3. Will Chambers
4. Cameron Munster
5. Cheyse Blair
6. Blake Green
7. Cooper Cronk
8. Jesse Bromwich
9. Cameron Smith
10. Jordan McLean
11. Kevin Proctor
12. Tohu Harris
13. Dale Finucane
14. Kenny Bromwich
15. Tim Glasby
16. Christian Welch
17. Nelson Asofa-Solomona
Strengths
So I am not going to talk about the Big Three. It is pointless. We all know just how great Billy Slater is especially in attack. We all know that Cronk is one of, if not the best organiser in the game and the real leader of this side. And it is widely known that Cameron Smith is probably the best hooker of all time.
What I will say is that the Big Three will still fire despite their age. When those three are on the field, they always play incredibly well. They will retire before their form really starts to slide.

Marika Koroibete was Melbourne's best buy for 2015. Coming into 2015 the wing situation was looking pretty dire for the club, with Matt Duffie being constantly injured and Sisa Waqa leaving the club. But Koroibete stepped up, and brought with them some fantastic form.
Their ability to score tries off of bombs really proved valuable to the side and was a trademark attacking play for them. Needless to say, they will again provide a lot of service for this Melbourne squad.
Will Chambers is one of the best centres in the game.  They are reluctant to pass, but the fact they are considered so good even with this deficiency just demonstrates their well-rounded play. Their running game is top tier and he's an auto-pick for Queensland.
Cameron Munster will partner Chambers in the centres and will form one of the better centre combinations in the league. They exploded onto the scene last year to replace Slater and played better than their more illustrious teammate.
Munster created linebreaks at a whim last year and was Melbourne's best player for the second half of the season. They may be a natural fullback, but given their previous junior experience in the centres they will certainly be able to play there, and they need too.  They are too talented to keep out of the side.
Blake Green was another great buy for the much maligned club last season. Melbourne spent 2014 without a proper five-eighth after the loss of Gareth Widdop, but Green filled that hole very well. They worked incredibly well behind Cronk and started to perform as a live wire which really brought their side of the field to life offensively.
Opposition teams can no longer just smother Cronk on the last tackle anymore, like they did in 2014. Green not only has a good boot, but a very good short passing game and a decent ‘dummy and run' which led to them scoring eight tries last year.
They will once again have a similar year, and force the opposition to not just focus all of their defence on Cronk on the last tackle.

Jesse Bromwich is one of the best props in the game.  They are a starting prop for New Zealand and just eats up the metres. Their total metres last year was the highest for a forward, and they can play huge minutes as well, which is something they are going to need to do with the bench Melbourne possess. Some people like to say that now it is ‘the big four' and they include Bromwich as that last member.
Jordan McLean and Nelson Asofa-Solomona are also quite handy props as well. McLean may be famous for breaking Alex Mckinnon's neck but they are a very solid forward, that gets through their work and does it well.
Asofa-Solomona is a giant of a kid.  They are at the Shannon Boyd level of ‘a player who is too tall to actually tackle', which allows them to power through opposition defence.  They are by far and away the best player on this Melbourne bench.
I like the second rowers and lock for this side as well. Kevin Proctor, Tohu Harris and Dale Finucane all combine to form a very powerful back row. Proctor and Harris are both coming off of impressive seasons, and the combination these two have with their halves is rather underrated.
Craig Bellamy, what can I say about them that hasn't already been said? They have only missed the finals once in their career, due to the fact that their team couldn't win any points. Players always seem to improve at Melbourne, and that is no coincidence.
Bellamy can get the very best out of anyone, and just keeps overachieving year after year. There are rumours that 2016 will be their last year for the club and that they are going to call it a day since they are off-contract now (although they do have a clause which means they can stay on until 2018 if they want).
I would be worried about that if I was a Melbourne fan.  They are one of those coaches that you will never be able to replace. They have a 66 per cent win rate in over 300 games, which is just ridiculous.
Weaknesses
Cronk and Slater are both coming off injuries. Slater's last game in State of Origin. I have heard a lot of conflicting reports about their fitness, some saying they are the fittest they have been in years, others saying they are really struggling. I don't know which one to believe, but I do know that rumours of being injured are never a good thing.

Cheyse Blair sucks, pure and simple. They have their moments, and can deliver some powerful runs but I think they coat their hands in butter to warm up for every match. They just drops the ball constantly.  They are also very lazy in defence.
You might say they are a stereotypical Bellamy signing, but players like Mahe Founa have shown that you can still suck even when you are coached by the best. And I have a feeling Blair will be one of those players, but the problem is they are their best option in this position. Everyone else is too crap or too young.
Here we get to the big problem with this side. The bench and the depth.
Unfortunately with the Big Three eating so much cap space there is no way Melbourne can have great players everywhere, without giving them all yachts anyway. So although most of their starting 13 is good, their bench is terrible and their depth is shockingly poor.
Apart from Asofa-Solomona, I don't think any of those Melbourne bench players would make most sides. They really offer nothing at all, and Bellamy is quite aware of this. Look at how many minutes they make their starting 13 play. They only subs their starters off to give them a break and puts them back on as soon as possible, because they know the lack of ability their bench players possess.
And look at the depth. Who comes in for injuries to the forwards? Matthew White? White is not first-grade standard, nor is they even close. And what about injuries to the backs? And with both Cronk and Slater being very injury prone, the depth is going to be very important for this side.
Expectations
This is a side with one of the best spines in the business, a great starting forward pack and second row, decent outside backs and one of the greatest coaches of all time. It has depth and bench issues, but Craig Bellamy will find a way to work around it.
And let's be honest, the Big Three aren't going to slow down, and even if they do it will be by a tiny amount. I see them giving the premiership a real shake this year, finishing third in the regular season.

Conclusion
This is another club whose premiership window is coming to a close. After years of being at the top, their side is getting older. And when Slater, Cronk and Smith retire in two or so years, they are going to have to enter a rebuilding period.
These upcoming two seasons are going to be this club's last chance at another premiership for a while, and I expect them to give it their best.
Monday, August 5, was the day that the German government hoped would finally provide some relief in the ongoing surveillance scandal. That morning, a member of the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), Germany's foreign intelligence agency, stationed at the embassy in Washington picked up four German officials at a local hotel. Driving in two dark sedans, they headed for Fort Meade in the state of Maryland, the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA), which gathers military intelligence for the US Department of Defense.
The four were part of a high-ranking delegation that had landed in the US capital a day earlier. It included: Gerhard Schindler, the BND chief; Hans-Georg Maassen, their counterpart from the Cologne-based Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency; Klaus-Dieter Fritsche, a state secretary at the German Interior Ministry; and Günter Heiss, intelligence coordinator for German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Keith Alexander received their German visitors in a windowless, air-conditioned conference room. They greeted them with a friendly "How are you?" -- as if nothing had transpired over the past few weeks. Alexander, 61, is a graduate of the legendary West Point military academy, a four-star general, the father of four daughters and, for the past eight years, director of the NSA. And they were also the man who was supposed to take the pressure off Merkel's conservative government.
And Alexander delivered. They had their people prepare a paper: a single sheet of white paper, but one without letterhead or a cover letter or a name to indicate that someone could later be held accountable. This impersonal list of facts had been approved, word for word, by the agency's legal department. According to a German translation of the document, it says that the NSA abides by all agreements that have been reached with the German government, represented by the German intelligence agencies, and has always done so in the past.
The general's note was what the Germans have been waiting for all these weeks. It was the document that they had long been hoping would absolve Berlin of all responsibility in the data scandal sparked by the intelligence leaks of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. This slip of paper is supposedly proof that the Germans -- and, indeed, the NSA -- have done nothing wrong.
Just one week earlier, a second German delegation in London had received a similar statement from the NSA's British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). The key sentence in that document also says that the GCHQ's work is subject to the legal requirements of both countries at all times.
"The allegation of the purported total surveillance in Germany can now be dismissed," German Chancellery Chief of Staff Ronald Pofalla subsequently announced last Monday. "There are not millions of civil rights violations in Germany, as is constantly erroneously maintained," they concluded. Shortly thereafter, German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich enthusiastically noted that the allegations had "disappeared into thin air."
So, all is well? That was at least the opinion of the Frankfurter Allgemeine, a leading conservative newspaper in Germany, which published a commentary announcing that the "German election chapter 'Worldwide Presence of American Intelligence Agencies' has been closed." But a few pages further on in the same edition was an article by German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger that took the opposite position. The minister, who is a member of the business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP), the junior partner in Merkel's ruling coalition, wrote: "An honest response to the question of how involved we are in this surveillance can only be: right in the middle."
Indeed, ever since Snowden leaked the first classified documents early last June, the true extent of US data surveillance has remained unclear. Hardly any of the allegations have been credibly refuted -- not even by the Chancellery.
Under the search term "#PofallabeendetDinge" (literally, "#Pofalla puts an end to things"), Tumblr bloggers have been poking fun at the sheer chutzpah of the Merkel aide with quips like "In my view, Schubert's 8th Symphony is now over." They have a point: It's certainly not every day that the government itself officially lays to rest a political scandal.
Pofalla's defense strategy rests on a shaky foundation: The German government is relying on the solemn statements of British and US intelligence agencies. Yet it has turned a blind eye to the fact that spreading disinformation, maintaining secrets, bending the rules and using lies and deception are as integral to the game of espionage as Parmesan cheese is to spaghetti Bolognese -- even among the intelligence agencies of democratic states.
Backtracking
Following their meeting with NSA General Alexander at Fort Meade, the four German officials met in early August in Washington with James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence. They also assured the visitors that everything was done by the book.
In Pofalla's eyes, this also makes them a key witness for the government's defense. But Clapper may not be the most reliable source. Last March, they told the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA did "not wittingly" snoop on the communications of American citizens -- a statement that was shortly thereafter exposed as a lie.
When Snowden leaked the first classified NSA documents, Clapper had to make a swift retraction. They said that the response that they gave the committee, under oath, was "the least untruthful" testimony, but soon admitted that their statement was "clearly erroneous."
As part of a rare act of collaboration, a bipartisan group of 26 US senators sent a written complaint to Clapper maintaining that their statements, and those of other officials, were "misleading the public" and "will unfortunately undermine trust in government more broadly."
The credibility of other key witnesses for Pofalla has also been shaken. Alexander and their NSA have come under increasing pressure for deceiving the public on a number of occasions. The NSA initially reacted to the Snowden leaks with a "fact sheet." Two influential senators from the intelligence committee later criticized this document as "inaccurate" and "misleading" on the issue of whether American citizens could be affected by the NSA's Prism surveillance program.
Now it seems clear that the NSA can search through its database of American citizens' phone calls and emails, even without a warrant, thanks to a legal loophole dating back to 2011. Furthermore, the intelligence agency has the authority to collect the communications of Americans who are in direct contact with "foreign targets," as the NSA calls them.
Last week, Pofalla saw how little credence could be given to official American statements -- only days after US President Barack Obama publicly insisted that NSA surveillance programs were exclusively used to prevent terrorist attacks, and that the agency was complying with all laws and regulations. Earlier, NSA head Alexander went even further out on a limb when they made assurances that reviews of their agency's activities over four years detected "no willful or knowledgeable violations of the law or the intent of the law in this program," adding: "That's the fact."
Last Thursday, however, the Washington Post revealed that the NSA has violated the privacy of US citizens and overstepped its authority thousands of times every year. For instance, the Snowden documents reveal that, due to a programming error, phones calls in Washington (area code 202) were intercepted because of confusion with Egypt (area code 20), the actual target of the surveillance. It comes as little surprise, though, that this escaped the attention of the branches of the government charged with overseeing NSA activity. The most recently disclosed documents reveal that the NSA instructs its analysts not to provide too much detail in their reports to the US Department of Justice and Clapper's Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
The NSA's Not-So-Light Touch
The NSA analysts apparently feel that the illegal surveillance of US citizens presents no serious consequences. This is indicated by a document seen by SPIEGEL which states that, if Americans inadvertently fall under the scope of surveillance, it has to be reported internally, but otherwise there is "nothing to worry about."
The public justifications made by the NSA bear a startling resemblance to the fine semantics of statements that have been made by German officials, which must be read very carefully. One example of this is the most comprehensive press release in the history of the NSA, which the intelligence agency released on Friday, August 9.
In one shaded section of its seven-page declaration, the NSA vaguely writes that it "touches" only about 1.6 percent of worldwide Internet traffic every day -- without providing any further explanation of its unusual use of the word "touch" in this context.
It may not sound like much, but this is actually an enormous amount of data. In effect, 1.6 percent of one day's global Internet traffic means that the NSA "touches" or "collects" some 29 petabytes per day. This would be roughly three times as much data as is contained in the Internet Archive, a nonprofit digital library whose stated mission is to provide "universal access to all knowledge." The archive has stored, among other things, 150 billion websites.
But the figure "1.6 percent" is misleading for another reason. Only a fraction of global Internet traffic is interesting for intelligence agencies. Emails and chats are targeted, for instance, but not necessarily the millions of videos that are sent or uploaded every day online.
Writing for London's Guardian newspaper, Internet expert Jeff Jarvis, a professor of journalism at City University of New York (CUNY), said that all pertinent communications in the US amount to just 2.9 percent of Internet traffic. This sheds a totally new light on the purportedly small figure of 1.6 percent. It means that the NSA "touches" roughly half of all communications on the Web -- or, as Jarvis writes, "practically everything that matters."
In view of all this, it would be grossly negligent to rely on the NSA as a key source of information. Not much value can arguably be placed on the assurances made by an agency that has demonstrably deceived and lied to the public -- an agency that Senator Wyden accuses of cultivating a "culture of misinformation."
The London Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is set to launch a one-year pilot project that equips cops with body-worn video cameras to be used during their interactions with the public. The pilot will include a total of 500 cameras distributed across ten city boroughs.
The 31,000-officer-strong MPS is not the first police department to deploy systems designed to track its officers. Across the pond, for example, the Boston and Los Angeles Police Departments have installed self-monitoring systems on police cruisers, while dozens of US police departments, including those in Fort Worth, Las Vegas, and New Orleans, have deployed wearable police cameras.
The MPS chose to purchase 500 Axon body-worn cameras alongside a backend management system from Taser International, a manufacturer of law enforcement products and electrical weapons. The body-worn cameras in question are small, battery-operated devices that can attach to sunglasses, a shirt collar, a cap, or a head mount and can record wide-angle, full-color views of the officer's visual field, according to a press release. A red "flash" appears on such devices to indicate when the camera is activated.
Taser has indicated that London's test is the largest such urban pilot anywhere in the world. Two response teams on each borough will be suited with such cameras when answering emergency 999 calls during the pilot. The findings of the pilot will be used to determine future implementation of such technologies.
"Our Axon body-worn cameras are a game changer for law enforcement agencies worldwide and are helping police officers reduce crime and build safer communities,” Jeff Kukowski, Taser International's chief operating officer, told Ars. “When you look at community safety today, there are any number of scenarios where there is controversy. Video helps pool together what happens."
Taser's press statement further cites a study examining the cameras' effects on a small police force in Rialto, California, that the company alleges “showed an 88 percent reduction in citizen complaints and a 60 percent reduction in uses of force after implementation of Taser's Axonflex BWV cameras.”
MPS Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said, "Video captures events in a way that can't be represented on paper in the same detail, and it has been shown the mere presence of this type of video can often defuse potentially violent situations without the need for force to be used."
Don't shoot!
While Kukowski and Hogan-Howe tout the potential for such technologies to improve the quality of policing, reduce instances where force is used, provide accountability, and serve as valuable evidence in criminal proceedings, some cops have been less than enthused about recording their interactions with civilians.
For example, a New York Police Department officer on Tuesday appears to have forcibly prevented a bicyclist who ran a red light from recording their subsequent interaction.
The cop's alleged justification for doing so, according to the cyclist, was that “recording a police officer was illegal because people are using iPhones as guns and shooting cops through the camera lens.” The bicyclist spent 13 hours in lockup and was charged with resisting arrest, obstruction, and criminal mischief for what they believed was an exercise of their constitutional right to record a public interaction with a cop.
The NYPD Patrol Guide Section 212-49 states, “Members of the service will not interfere with the videotaping or the photographing of incidents in public places. Intentional interference such as blocking or obstructing cameras or harassing the photographer constitutes censorship.”
The officer that wears it
Cops aren't the only ones who have questioned these surveillance systems.
Privacy advocates like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have argued that the efficacy of police body-mounted cameras as a crime reduction and accountability tool hinges on enforcement of good policies and procedures—including something as basic as preventing officers from being able to deactivate the cameras at their own discretion.
Indeed, Taser's Kukowski said that their firm's cameras "protect the chain of custody the entire way along," noting that there is "complete auditability on everything that's ever happened during the entire life-cycle of the system."
For now, the ACLU is withholding judgment.
“If the departments have good policies regarding the footage that bans surreptitious recording, includes an exclusionary remedy when the camera's selectively turned off by officers at the wrong time, et cetera, they can be great,” Kade Crockford, of the ACLU Massachusetts, told Ars. "If used correctly, cameras can be beneficial to reduce police brutality and can aid accurate record-keeping. But we're waiting to see how they're implemented.”
Title American Innovations Author Rivka Galchen Genre Fiction Publisher Farrar, Straus & Giroux Pages 175 Price $26.99
We Canadians like to lay our mucky little mitts on authors who make good – most recently, New Zealander Eleanor Catton, winner of the Man Booker Prize and, by dint of birth, the Governor-General's Award. Having left the country as an infant, Galchen is even less Canadian than Catton, or that other celebrated Jewish-American author, Saul Bellow, Lachine's famous son. But their debut collection of stories is so frightfully superb I found myself wishing they lived right next door so I could run over to borrow a cup of organic cane sugar and some of their mojo.
American Innovations has a literary genealogy traceable from U.S. short-story doyenne Ann Beattie through Lorrie Moore to Rebecca Lee (another ex-pat and heir-apparent to Moore in light of their terrific 2012 collection Bobcat and Other Stories), with traces of Aimee Bender's dark fairy dust and Julie Hecht's delightfully tangential and neurotic anti-hero. Add a splash of David Foster Wallace, shake well (don't stir), and you have a thoroughly Galchean concoction – funny, intellectual, and playfully dark.
I know, because the book jacket tells me so, that some of these stories are responses to classic works by the likes of Thurber, Borges and Gogol. In all honesty, I wouldn't have noticed. These are narrative similarities, rather than those of style and voice, and it is style and voice that elevate these remarkably vibrant stories into something transcendent.

Stuff happens, yes: a woman's furniture leaves her, another grows an extra breast, and a wrong-number take-out-orderer harasses yet another unravelling 21st-century gal. Stories take place in Manhattan, Key West, and Oklahoma; wedding rings are lost, science-fiction-author conferences attended, and recovering heroin addicts crushed on.
But it's in putting words to feelings, in capturing the often unsayable, that Galchen hits it out of the park again and again. "We hadn't always conversed in a way that sounded like advanced ESL students trying to share emotions, but recently that was happening to us." "I felt that my love for Roy shamed my people, whoever my people were, whoever I was queen of, people I had never met, nervous people and sad people and dead people, all clambering for air and space inside me." A lawyer specializing in toxic-mold litigation wakes up one day and thinks, "I am a fork being used to eat cereal. I am not a spoon. I am a fork. And I can't help people eat cereal any longer."
And here's a woman looking back on the height of childhood queasiness during a weekly McDonald's ritual: "Though the surface of the milk often remained pristine, I could feel the cookie's presence down below, lurking. Like some ancient bottom-dwelling fish with both eyes on one side of its head."
The stories can be rambling, yet profound. A number of them appear constructed of unrelated elements, but attain a feeling of complete convergence. In Dean of the Arts, set in Galchen's childhood home of Norman, Oklahoma, the disparate elements are the discovery of a self-published book called The Collected Correspondence of Manuel Macheko, a fired professor (the purported author of said book), a high-school debating tournament and, years later, a trip to Mexico City and a close encounter with Ralph Ellison. The way Galchen delivers a scene, jumps in time, and then allows all the seemingly disparate parts to rub up against each other until a staticky resonance is achieved, is reminiscent of Alice Munro's sleight of hand.
As in Atmospheric Disturbances, Galchen's acclaimed debut novel, there are communications with the dead, and the possibility of other, slightly off-kilter, universes where things like time travel are scientifically possible. Or are they? In my favourite story, The Region of Unlikeness, Galchen combines an unwieldy love triangle with the speculative, resulting in a kind of mash-up of Back to the Future and Truffaut's Jules et Jim, although rather than Jeanne Moreau's free-spirited Catherine, the woman here is a lonely and insecure graduate student in civil engineering. The happiest days of their life begin when they meet Ilan and Jacob by chance in a Moroccan coffee shop on Upper West Side. "They were discussing Wuthering Heights too loudly, having the kind of reference-laden conversation that unfortunately never fails to attract me," revealing everything we need to know about them and the men.
These stories made me feel alive and alert in the same way that "the girl" in The Region of Unlikeness felt so briefly with their mysterious new friends. But unlike Ilan and Jacob, the stories remain true on this and other planes of existence.

In 2016, Oxfam estimated that the total wealth of 99 per cent of the global population was barely equivalent to the wealth of the top one per cent - and it would get worse each year.
Over the past few months, Bernie Sanders has made the point that, in the US, the top ten per cent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 per cent.
Concentration of wealth also means concentration of power - political and social, privileges and opportunities. The reverse is also true. If you don't have any wealth, you have no power, no privileges, no opportunities. But can this inequality be tackled?
My answer is yes - but individuals must view it as a personal priority and put pressure on government to create policies that will facilitate it.
The concept of the free market relies on the notion of the so-called "invisible hand", which ensures competition and thus contributes to equilibrium in the markets. Also, that society benefits automatically if individuals pursue their own interests without paying attention to social benefits. But does the invisible hand ensure benefits equally for everybody? Obviously, the invisible hand is dedicatedly biased to the richest. That's why enormous wealth concentration continues.
We need to transform this inverted pyramid of wealth concentration into a new shape; a wealth diamond with very few at the top, very few at the bottom, and bulk of the people in the middle. The usual political agenda to reduce the problem focuses on income gap, not on wealth gap. It is done through a programme of income redistribution: taking from the top (through progressive taxes) and giving it to the bottom (through various transfer payments).
Clearly, only governments can undertake such redistribution programmes. However, in a democratic environment, a government cannot achieve success in a redistribution programme. People at the top from whom governments are supposed to collect heavy taxes are politically very powerful. They use their disproportionate influence on governments to restrain them from taking any meaningful step against their interest.
I don't think addressing income inequality is a real answer; it addresses the cause, not the manifestation. We must address the wealth gap which is the cause of the income gap. If we keep the wealth base unchanged, any reduction in income gap will be ineffective.

On top of that, governments' cash transfer programmes are usually charity programmes, which are excellent as temporary relief, but cannot give a permanent solution to the problem. Although governments should continue with their redistribution programmes, I am proposing to bring the citizen's power to transform the wealth pyramid into a wealth diamond. The central point in my proposal is to redesign the economic framework by moving from personal interest-driven economics to both personal and collective interest-driven economics.
Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for founding Grameen Bank Vittorio Zunino Celotto / Getty
In 1983, I created Grameen Bank (GB) in Bangladesh. It wasn't like other financial institutions. Everything a conventional bank did, we did the opposite. They love to operate where businesses and rich people locate their offices. As a result, they work in cities. GB works in villages. After 30 years, GB does not have branches in any city or municipal area. Conventional banks are owned by rich people; GB is owned by the poor. Conventional banks serve mostly men; GB focuses on women. Conventional banks believe that the poor are not creditworthy. GB established for the first time in history that the poor people, more so poor women, are creditworthy in any formal banking sense. Grameen America has 18 branches in nine cities in the US with 62,000 borrowers, all of whom are women. It has given out $380m with the average startup loan being $1,000, and repayment rates are 99.9 per cent.
Conventional banks operate on the basis of collateral. GB is collateral-free. Therefore, it is lawyer-free. We have a banking system based on trust. In GB, borrowers don't come to the bank, the bank goes to borrowers. GB created a pension fund to make sure that borrowers can take care of themselves in their old age. GB offers health insurance, loans to beggars, student loans for the children of GB families, loans to build sanitary facilities. GB partially covers the funeral cost of the borrowers and loans are written off when a borrower dies. At GB, interest on a loan cannot exceed principal, no matter how long it takes to repay.

My belief is that we need to build separate institutions with completely different architecture. Rich people's banks are not designed to serve the poor. They may take some token actions through NGOs, under pressure from above, but that won't constitute even a fraction of one per cent of their business. The unbanked of the world need real banking, not some "let-us-look-good" actions.
Credit should be recognised as a human right so that it can be addressed seriously and be given the importance it deserves. We can establish this only by creating a financial system for the poor.
I was amazed how easy it was to solve human problems by designing GB as a business with the sole mission of solving a problem, and with no intention to benefit financially from the business. We are always told that the business engine was designed for only one use: making money for personal use. I used the same engine for a completely different purpose: that is, to solve human problems.
I wondered why the world left the problem-solving to the governments and charities alone, and found
the answer: it was because the business world was given a very clear mandate by economic theory. Their only mandate was to make money, leaving the people's problems to be addressed by governments and charities. A business person is supposed to be driven by self-interest. To him, business is business.
What is impossible today becomes possible tomorrow. Dramatic changes take place in technology in such quick succession that it does not surprise us anymore. It is only the power of the imagination of young people that limits the exploitation of each new technology. The bolder their imagination, the greater their accomplishments. If they start imagining a world where wealth disparity shall not exist, I can guarantee it will not exist. The combined power of youth, technology and social business can become an irresistible force.
Once we transform the education system to produce creative entrepreneurs, the picture of the wealth gap will start changing. If we leave young people with the destiny of making other people rich, wealth concentration will continue to soar. We cannot let young people become mercenaries for this system.
And we can decide to invest in social business directly or through others who are involved in it. We can earmark five per cent of our annual income and put it in a separate account, a sort of personal social business fund, to invest in social businesses.
The time is ripe for us to recognise the gravity of wealth concentration, and take actions against it. As we learn from the process of arriving at a consensus on global warming, we can initiate a similar process to build a global consensus on bringing the speed of wealth concentration to zero in phase one, and going on to make it negative in phase two.
We can undo both by reinventing ourselves as caring and sharing human beings. We may aim at creating a world of three zeros: zero poverty, zero unemployment, and zero net carbon emission. A world of diamond-shaped wealth distribution. A world of equality. It can happen if we take action in 2017.

So, you may not know this, but speech in America isn't completely free. You've probably heard of the “fire in a crowded movie theater” exception. However, unless you've gone to law school, you probably don't have much of an idea what is protected, and what isn't. Here's a quick quiz. Some of these things are protected speech, and some are not:
Flag burning Cross burning (for explicitly racist purposes) Cursing in public Cursing at the Supreme Court Pornography Hate speech Advocating violent overthrow of the government Depictions of animal cruelty
If you guessed “all of those are protected,” you would be WRONG! All of them are protected… except for pornography. According to our Supreme Court, certain categories of speech are “of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.” These categories are generally limited to “fighting words” and obscenity.
Obscenity is not what you're thinking, though. “Obscenity,” according to our Supreme Court (and most recently by Justice Scalia), is limited to strictly sexual imagery. Not cursing. Not blood & gore. Not torture. Just sex.
The Court never really offers a rationale WHY sex has no value to a society; it just operates under the assumption that sexual imagery is less than worthless, and can be actively harmful. Look back at the list at the top of the post. The Court has held, at one time or another, that each one of those examples has enough value to our society to be worthy of protection. But not sex. When it comes to sex, it's just too dangerous.
I don't know what happened to make SCOTUS so afraid of sex, but let's hope the next generation approaches the issue with a little more sanity.

A new study has been completed and the Sydney suburbs with the most crime have been revealed.
The results have showed that most of the suburbs are in the west.
According to news.com.au and the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, Bankstown is on top of the list for the most car thefts with Blacktown coming in first for the most burglaries and the most vandalism.
Just within the last six years, there have been 1,457 recorded break-ins in the Blacktown area.
Dr Garner Clancey, a criminologist and senior lecturer at Sydney University, told news.com.au that criminals generally target areas they grew up in or are familiar with.
They stated. “The journey to crime data suggests offenders travel quite short distances, only a couple of kilometres and tend to offend in areas they know, because they have an understanding of likely chances to be caught.”
Suburbs with the most car thefts:
Bankstown (991) Blacktown (887) Liverpool (805) Auburb (625) Penrith (625)
Suburbs with the most burglaries:
Blacktown (1,457) Liverpool (1,156) Parramatta (1,125) Strathfield (1,082) Westmead (985)
Suburbs with the most vandalism:
FAYETTE COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- Two women are in jail after deputies went to a house that had a sign warning that "snitches" were going to be searched.
April Lavender, 38, of Oak Hill, was charged with possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver.
Deputies went to the home to follow up on a complaint of joyriding after Lavender's grandmother called deputies saying they had let their granddaughter (Lavender) use their car but they didn't bring it back when they said they would.
When deputies got to the home they saw the sign, which led deputies to think drugs were likely being sold from the house on Central Avenue in Oak Hill.
The sign reads "Due to snitches, everyone entering my home is subject to being searched. All cell phones and drinks will be left outside. If you're not a snitch, it won't offend you if I search you."
The house was searched by deputies and heroin and meth were found inside, as well as other substances believed to be narcotics.
"Who would put something up like that other than someone doing drugs?" said Fayette County Deputy Chief Mike Fridley.
"When you post a note, you never know who's gonna knock on your door, so it just leads to a good arrest by deputy sheriffs."
Another woman at the house was charged with joyriding.
"While drug investigations often require a great deal of time and effort, sometimes the criminals make our job pretty easy," said Sheriff Steve Kessler. "If someone posts a sign on their front door about searching 'snitches,' it's a pretty safe bet that there are illegal drugs being sold out of that location."
Lavender was taken to Southern Regional Jail. Their bond was set at $10,000.
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Gun control supporter Robin Kelly won the Democratic primary for a Chicago area U.S. House seat on Tuesday, propelled by more than $2 million in television ads highlighting the guns issue bankrolled by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Kelly, a former Illinois state representative, said in their victory speech that the vote was a setback for the powerful gun rights lobby, the National Rifle Association.
“The voters sent a message that tells the NRA that their days of holding our country hostage are coming to an end. And their days of scaring Congress into submission on gun control are coming to a close,” Kelly said to cheers from supporters.
The NRA fiercely defends the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution setting out the right to bear arms.
The Chicago special election was the first U.S. electoral test since gun control rose to the top of the political agenda after a gunman killed 26 people at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in December.
Since that massacre, which took the lives of 20 school children, President Barack Obama has pushed Congress to pass tighter gun restrictions and Bloomberg has vowed to use some of their fortune to help battle the political influence of the NRA.
The special election was to fill the seat of indicted former U.S. Representative Jesse Jackson Jr, who resigned in November citing health problems and pleaded guilty in federal court last week to using campaign funds for personal enrichment.
Jackson was a reliable vote in Congress for gun control. Until Bloomberg elbowed into the race, polls had shown that the special election might be won by Debbie Halvorson, a former member of congress who had an A+ rating from the NRA and opposed an assault weapons ban.
Bloomberg blanketed Chicago television with ads on the gun issue, attacking Halvorson and endorsing Kelly in the final days of the campaign.
“He turned this election into a referendum on the NRA,” said Chicago Democratic political analyst Don Rose.
A little over an hour after the polls closed, Halvorson called Kelly to concede defeat, saying that Bloomberg's television ads had overwhelmed them campaign.
“There was $2.3 million minimum spent against me,” Halvorson told supporters. “That's the way it is. I can't help it.”
The Illinois affiliate of the NRA had asked its members to vote for Halvorson.
Kelly, 56, highlighted Chicago's rash of murders from a surge in gang violence ravaging poor neighborhoods. The shootings have claimed the lives of dozens of young people, including Hadiya Pendleton, a high school student who was killed just over a week after they performed at Obama's inauguration.
Bloomberg issued a statement immediately after Kelly was declared the winner, saying that the Illinois vote showed Americans want change in Washington.
“As Congress considers the president's gun package, voters in Illinois have sent a clear message: We need common sense gun legislation now. Now it's up to Washington to act,” they said.
Political analyst Rose said the Chicago district was receptive to Bloomberg's anti-gun message because it is heavily Democratic, and because of the plague of local gun violence. They said it was too soon to tell if the outcome would have national implications.
With nearly all the vote counted, Kelly had about 52 percent to 24 percent for Halvorson. More than a dozen other candidates, some of whom had withdrawn from the race but remained on the ballot, split the remainder of the Democratic vote.
Turnout was light because of a snowstorm that hit the Chicago area on Tuesday, making travel treacherous.
The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to be elected to the seat in the general election on April 9 because the district is Democratic. Three candidates were in a close race for the Republican nomination to face Kelly in April.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders attacked Obama for daring to take credit for the depression that they avoided and claimed that Trump deserves all the credit for an economy that is slowing down.
Video:
Huckabee Sanders said on Fox News, “It is laughable president Obama thinks they have anything to do with the success of the economy. It was just over 1% gdp when Trump took over it has gradually gone up it will likely hit 4% next year jobs are growing it is all a direct result not just of President Trump swearing in but from the moment they were elected consumer confidence is stronger business is wanted to participate again in with them getting a bid of regulation there is a reason that it continues to go up and started when President Trump was elected it has nothing to do with president Obama. And everybody knows that including President Obama and it is laughable they take credit for that. Jesse: This is probably the best of all time with manufacturing jobs.”
The economy is slowing under Trump.
As CNN recently reported, “The US economy has created 1.9 million jobs so far this year, according to Trump's own Labor Department. That's not bad, but during the same period, from January through November of last year, the economy created nearly 2.1 million jobs. Trump took office on January 20, 2017, but even if you remove January from the equation, the numbers still favor Obama. From February to November last year, the economy created 1.96 million jobs. During the same period this year, it created 1.7 million jobs. Jobs are not “roaring back,” as Trump claims. The job market is actually underperforming compared to last year.”
Trump created fewer jobs than Obama did over the same period last year. This is Obama's economy. Trump has done nothing to invest in it or boost it. What Donald Trump is about to do via a massive tax cut for the wealthy is taken money out of the economy. Trump is setting the nation up for a major recession.
Barack Obama took a country that was on the verge of a depression and through smart policy making created an environment for economic growth. It is laughable that Huckabee Sanders would try to give Trump any credit for what Obama has done. Donald Trump is the 21st Century Herbert Hoover.
The economy is heading for a drop and the man who is pushing it over the cliff is Trump.

The Bible isn't just a religious book. The characters in the Bible lived through a real history that was shared with other nations, but we usually hear only Israel's side of the story. The other nations of Biblical times were also keeping histories, which tell very different versions of the stories we've heard so many times.
10 The Greek Historian Strabo Said Moses Was An Egyptian Priest
The story of Moses and the Ten Commandments is one of the best-known stories of the Bible. With God's help, the Bible says, Moses brought plagues upon Egypt until the pharaoh set the Jews free.
According to the Greeks, though, Moses wasn't even Jewish. They were an Egyptian priest. Strabo tells us that Moses didn't like Egypt's institutions. They believed that God was in all things and so couldn't take the form of an animal or a person. This wasn't divine revelation. Here, it's just presented as a philosophical musing.
In Strabo's version, Moses didn't talk to God or fight the pharaoh. Moses just convinced a lot of people that they were right, and they emigrated freely to Jerusalem.
After Moses's death, Strabo wrote that Jerusalem was taken over by superstitious, violent people who brought in “tyrannical” laws like kosher diets and circumcision. “Their beginning was good,” Strabo wrote, “but they degenerated.”
9 Esther's Husband Is The Persian King Who Fought Leonidas And The 300 Spartans
Usually, we just see the story of Esther as the Bible presents it. Esther married the king of Persia, and when the evil Haman plotted the genocide of the Jews, they persuaded the king to save them people.
That king, though, was a major historical figure. Esther's husband was King Xerxes I, probably best known today as the bad guy from the movie 300. They were the Persian king who invaded Sparta and Athens after they refused to pay tribute and whose enormous army was held off by 300 Spartans.
If the story of Esther is true, it's speculated that it probably happened while Xerxes was planning their invasion. So Esther's father, Mordecai, would have been one of Xerxes's advisers during the war.
8 The King Of Moab Called The Israelites ‘Oppressors'
According to the Bible, King Mesha of Moab rebelled against Israel. With the help of God and the prophet Elisha, the Israelites fought off the Moabites and brought the war into Moab. Mesha sacrificed their own son as an offering to their gods, and the Israelites turned back home and willingly left Moab alone.
But we've found a version written by King Mesha that tells a very different story. According to Mesha, the Israelites were tyrants who “oppressed Moab many days.” Mesha asked for the freedom of their people, and Israel responded by threatening to destroy Moab.
Israel, Mesha says, attacked first, but they managed to fight them off. Then King Mesha and their men marched on Israel and took back several cities that Israel had stolen from them long ago. In Mesha's version, the war didn't end with Israel deciding to go home. Israel just lost.
7 Hazael Says Israel Attacked Him First
Photo via Wikimedia
The Bible only gives a brief mention of Hazael, the king of Aram. It says that Hazael conquered Israel by divine will because God “was kindled against Israel.” Also, Hazael “oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.”
We've actually found a stone inscribed by Hazael, though, that tells their side of the story. The stone is broken, so there's a lot of dispute over what it really says. According to the most popular theory, the stone suggests that Hazael invaded Israel as revenge for their invasion of Aram when their father was king. Then Hazael executed the kings of Israel.
Hazael doesn't deny, though, that they were oppressive. “I set their town into ruins,” Hazael boasts, “and their land into desolation.”
6 Manetho Said That Moses Invaded And Conquered Egypt
Photo via Wikimedia
Every country has its own version of the story of Moses—including Egypt. Like the Greeks, the Egyptians say that Moses was an Egyptian priest of Heliopolis. Manetho insists that Moses's real name was Osarsiph, but they changed it when they joined the Jews.
The story starts with Pharaoh Amenophis trying to cleanse the country of lepers after being told that leprosy was a divine curse. They put 80,000 lepers to work in a quarry and assigned Moses to take care of them.
Instead, a power-hungry Moses established their own laws and ruled over the lepers. Then they made an alliance with Jerusalem. With an army of lepers and Jews, Moses invaded and conquered Egypt, burning down their temples.”
It took 13 years for Amenophis to build up their army and chase Moses out of Egypt. This, Manetho says, is how Moses came to Jerusalem.
5 The Egyptians Celebrated Laying Israel To Waste
Archaeologists have found a slab engraved by Egyptian Pharaoh Merneptah shortly after the reign of Ramses the Great that appears to talk about Israel.
The slab was written when Egypt's world power was being tested by several smaller nations that were revolting against Egypt's control over them. According to the slab, Merneptah had defeated them all and laid them to ruin.
“Israel,” it says, “is laid waste, and their seed is not.”
But the exact meaning of that sentence is unclear. Some believe that the Egyptians slaughtered the children of Israel to keep them from revolting, although it might mean that the Egyptians just burned the Israelis' crops. If “seed” means “children,” though, the inscription proves that Egypt really did slaughter Israeli babies as in the story of Exodus.
4 The Roman Historian Tacitus Said That Moses Was An Atheist
Tacitus seemed to have a hard time piecing out the true story of Moses, but they did their best. Like the Egyptians, Tacitus said that Egypt was plagued by a disfiguring disease and that the pharaoh expelled the victims. In this version, though, the pharaoh sent them into the wilderness.
According to Tacitus, Moses was one of the diseased exiles and they hated God. They “urged their companions not to wait passively for help from god or man, for both had deserted them.” Moses led their group to Canaan and conquered it. Then they founded Judaism—not because they believed in it but as a political tool to keep their people loyal.
3 The Jewish Talmud Calls Jesus A Sorcerer
The Talmud gives its own version of the crucifixion of Jesus. It tells the story of a man called “Yeshu” who is generally accepted as the Jesus of the Christian faith.
According to the Talmud, before Jesus was executed, a herald was sent out calling them a sorcerer. “Anyone who can say anything in their favor,” the herald said, “let them come forward and plead on their behalf!” No one came forward to stand up for Jesus.
In the Talmud, a man named Ulla is quoted as saying of Jesus, “Do you suppose that they are one for whom a defense could be made?” Ulla goes on to condemn the people who defended Jesus, saying that the scriptures said that a person like Jesus should never be spared.
“With Yeshu, however, it was different,” Ulla said, “for they were connected with royalty.”
2 Pliny The Younger Asked For Help On How To Deal With Christians
The biblical Book of Acts describes a time when Christians were horribly persecuted by the Romans.
However, we have a unique insight into the Roman view of this in a letter from Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan. Pliny asked Trajan for help in dealing with Christians because Pliny didn't know how far they should go.
They called Christianity a “depraved, excessive superstition” and said that their policy had been to give Christians the opportunity to “curse Christ.” If they did, Pliny let them go. But if they wouldn't, he'd have them executed.
Pliny thought they were doing the right thing in letting Christians renounce their religion. “A multitude of people can be reformed if an opportunity for repentance is afforded,” they wrote.
Trajan approved. “They are not to be sought out,” they wrote back. “If they are denounced and proven guilty, they are to be punished.”
1 The Romans Thought Christians Were Cannibals
The Romans hated the Christians. Tacitus called their religion “a most hideous superstition” and said that they were charged with “hatred against humankind.” Even when they criticized Nero for being too cruel to Christians, Tacitus still believed that Christians were “criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment.”
They aren't alone. Suetonius called Christianity a “mischievous superstition” and actually praised some emperors for keeping the Christians in line.
There's a reason for all the hate, though. When the Romans heard that Christians ate the body of Christ, the Romans took it literally. Many Romans believed that Christians would break into ritualistic cannibalism and incestuous orgies during assemblies.
There's no reason to believe that Christians were really cannibalizing anybody. However, it's interesting to think that if Christianity had been wiped out, that's exactly what our history books would say about Christians today.

When Julian Assange was first arrested, we were struck by the unusual zeal with which they were being pursued for rape allegations.
It seems even clearer now, that the allegations against them are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape, murder and destruction.
Justice for an accused rapist does not deny justice for their accusers. But in this case justice is being denied both to accusers and accused.
The judicial process has been corrupted. On the one hand, the names of the women have been circulated on the internet; they have been trashed, accused of setting a "honey trap", and seen their allegations dismissed as "not real rape". On the other hand, Assange is dealt with by much of the media as if they were guilty, though they have not even been charged. It is not for us to decide whether or not the allegations are true and whether what happened amounts to rape or sexual violence – we don't have all the facts and what has been said so far has not been tested. But we do know that rape victims' right to anonymity and defendants' right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty are both crucial to a just judicial process.
Swedish and British courts are responsible for how the women's allegations have been handled. As with every rape case, the women are not in charge of the case, the state is.
Whether or not Assange is guilty of sexual violence, we do not believe that is why they are being pursued. Once again women's fury and frustration at the prevalence of rape and other violence, is being used by politicians to advance their own purposes. The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will, usually to increase their powers, this time to facilitate Assange's extradition or even rendition to the US. That the US has not presented a demand for their extradition at this stage is no guarantee that they won't do so once they are in Sweden, and that they will not be tortured as Bradley Manning and many others, women and men, have. Women Against Rape cannot ignore this threat.
In over 30 years working with thousands of rape victims who are seeking asylum from rape and other forms of torture, we have met nothing but obstruction from British governments. Time after time, they have accused women of lying and deported them with no concern for their safety. We are currently working with three women who were raped again after having been deported – one of them is now destitute, struggling to survive with the child they conceived from the rape; the other managed to return to Britain and won the right to stay, and one of them won compensation.
Assange has made it clear for months that they are available for questioning by the Swedish authorities, in Britain or via Skype. Why are they refusing this essential step to their investigation? What are they afraid of?
In 1998 Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an extradition request from Spain. Their responsibility for the murder and disappearance of at least 3,000 people, and the torture of 30,000 people, including the rape and sexual abuse of more than 3,000 women often with the use of dogs, was never in doubt. Despite a lengthy legal action and a daily picket outside parliament called by Chilean refugees, including women who had been tortured under Pinochet, the British government reneged on its obligation to Spain's criminal justice system and Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile. Assange has not even been charged; yet the determination to have them extradited is much greater than ever it was with Pinochet. (Baltasar Garzón, whose request for extradition of Pinochet was denied, is representing Assange.) And there is a history of Sweden (and Britain) rendering asylum seekers at risk of torture at the behest of the US.
Like women in Sweden and everywhere, we want rapists caught, charged and convicted. We have campaigned for that for more than 35 years, with limited success. We are even having to campaign to prevent rape victims being accused of making false allegations and imprisoned for it. Two women who reported visibly violent attacks by strangers were given two and three year prison sentences.
But does anyone really believe that extraditing Julian Assange will strengthen women against rape? And do those supporting their extradition to Sweden care if they are then extradited to the US and tortured for telling the public what we need to know about those who govern us?

For those that want anything to help teach new players, here is my Next Level Foosball training tutorials and coursework. Its an Excel sheet containing 208 steps with video instruction, to becoming a proficient foosball player.

I really think any newbs, beginners, and amateurs would benefit from this.
Learning to play this game (later in age then when most people start learning it), I was lucky enough to be living in Colorado and have access to some of the best foosball tourneys, and players who were willing to spend their time helping me progress my own game to the NEXT LEVEL. (Especially those who have really dedicated effort into my progression, I give extra thanks to: Cameron Cross, Scott Thomas, Princess and Pickle, Fooser X, Boogie, Garret Sure Can Block and Moose).
Obviously this is not the Thats it Thats all of foosball. So dont judge it harshly that I dont mention certain things at all (blocking techniques, brush passes, rules, etc.). (Ill probably add more videos later though).
I made this with the thinking of: what would I have wanted access to when I was starting this game, to play a killer game, in the least amount of time possible.
Hopefully it can help assist The Future mes.
The main form of exposure to this I think will be through YouTube and anyone searching for tutorials on foosball , but everyone, please feel free to share this with anyone you think it would help, whether they are a seasoned player that just cant seem to do anything right , or the complete newbies that this might really help, to bring their game up to a tournament level in a short time frame.

Last summer's Mr. Robot was a breakout hit for NBC and its USA Network. The dramatic thriller about a vigilante computer hacker swept up in a revolution won acclaim and a handful of awards, including Best TV Drama at the Golden Globes. In an article from Deadline outlining the consolidation of NBC Universal's cable networks, Mr. Robot was credited for single-handedly changing the type of shows USA looks for, meaning the once-saccharine network could be the next cable TV powerhouse.
“We wanted to take a beat to see where the world is going,” NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment chairperson Bonnie Hammer told Deadline. “No matter what happens, what platforms emerge, smart content wins.”
The article then cited a paraphrased statement from Hammer, where they credit Mr. Robot as the door-opener to more daring types of shows that USA and sister network Syfy will look into.
“The consolidation further made sense as the USA moved away from its original blue-sky, frothy brand of scripted programming to edgier fare, illustrated by breakout hit and Golden Globe winner, Mr. Robot. Because of the shift, now a drama project could practically go on either network, USA or Syfy.”
After years of mid-range and off-brand programming, Syfy changed gears and became true to its name, leaning hard into high science-fiction through shows like The Expanse, The Magicians, Childhood's End, and Z-Nation. Because of Mr. Robot, USA is also in the middle of a shift with original shows like the sci-fi drama Colony.
Typical USA Network shows used to involve attractive hotshots with hearts of gold, but now USA's sunny skies have gotten a little gray, just like their new characters' morals.
Mr. Robot Season 2 will premiere later this summer.

Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke delivered a speech before the the Annual Meeting of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in Providence, Rhode Island. In the speech, they warned about the current state of the government finances. Their conclusion, the situation is dire and “unsustainable”.
It is remarkable that mainstream media has given this speech no coverage. I repeat, the central banker of the United States says in their own words:
Let me return to the issue of longer-term fiscal sustainability. As I have discussed, projections by the CBO and others show future budget deficits and debts rising indefinitely, and at increasing rates. To be sure, projections are to some degree only hypothetical exercises. Almost by definition, unsustainable trajectories of deficits and debts will never actually transpire, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a country in which the fiscal debt relative to the national income is rising without limit. Herbert Stein, a wise economist, once said, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” 9 One way or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to stabilize the federal budget will certainly occur at some point. The only real question is whether these adjustments will take place through a careful and deliberative process that weighs priorities and gives people plenty of time to adjust to changes in government programs or tax policies, or whether the needed fiscal adjustments will be a rapid and painful response to a looming or actual fiscal crisis.
This is as close as you are ever going to see a central banker admit that their country's financial situation is so dire that it could break up at any time.
Here's more from Bernanke's remarkable speech:
The recent deep recession and the subsequent slow recovery have created severe budgetary pressures not only for many households and businesses, but for governments as well. Indeed, in the United States, governments at all levels are grappling not only with the near-term effects of economic weakness, but also with the longer-run pressures that will be generated by the need to provide health care and retirement security to an aging population. There is no way around it–meeting these challenges will require policymakers and the public to make some very difficult decisions and to accept some sacrifices. But history makes clear that countries that continually spend beyond their means suffer slower growth in incomes and living standards and are prone to greater economic and financial instability.
Now, get this, they warn that it is not only the Federal government that has financial problems, but also states and local governments:
Although state and local governments face significant fiscal challenges, my primary focus today will be the federal budget situation and its economic implications.
Does Bernanke see the tsunami hitting or what?
Then, they put things in historical perspective:
The budgetary position of the federal government has deteriorated substantially during the past two fiscal years, with the budget deficit averaging 9-1/2 percent of national income during that time. For comparison, the deficit averaged 2 percent of national income for the fiscal years 2005 to 2007, prior to the onset of the recession and financial crisis. The recent deterioration was largely the result of a sharp decline in tax revenues brought about by the recession and the subsequent slow recovery, as well as by increases in federal spending needed to alleviate the recession and stabilize the financial system. As a result of these deficits, the accumulated federal debt measured relative to national income has increased to a level not seen since the aftermath of World War II.
Then, they explain the deterioration and the problems it will create for the entire economy:
For now, the budget deficit has stabilized and, so long as the economy and financial markets continue to recover, it should narrow relative to national income over the next few years. Economic conditions provide little scope for reducing deficits significantly further over the next year or two; indeed, premature fiscal tightening could put the recovery at risk. Over the medium- and long-term, however, the story is quite different. If current policy settings are maintained, and under reasonable assumptions about economic growth, the federal budget will be on an unsustainable path in coming years, with the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income rising at an increasing pace.2 Moreover, as the national debt grows, so will the associated interest payments, which in turn will lead to further increases in projected deficits. Expectations of large and increasing deficits in the future could inhibit current household and business spending–for example, by reducing confidence in the longer-term prospects for the economy or by increasing uncertainty about future tax burdens and government spending–and thus restrain the recovery. Concerns about the government's long-run fiscal position may also constrain the flexibility of fiscal policy to respond to current economic conditions.
Then, they tell us how powerful the negative trends are and how the aging population and Obamacare are going to make things worse:
Our fiscal challenges are especially daunting because they are mostly the product of powerful underlying trends, not short-term or temporary factors. Two of the most important driving forces are the aging of the U.S. population, the pace of which will intensify over the next couple of decades as the baby-boom generation retires, and rapidly rising health-care costs. As the health-care needs of the aging population increase, federal health-care programs are on track to be by far the biggest single source of fiscal imbalances over the longer term. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the ratio of federal spending for health-care programs (principally Medicare and Medicaid) to national income will double over the next 25 years, and continue to rise significantly further after that…he's aging of the U.S. population will also strain Social Security, as the number of workers paying taxes into the system rises more slowly than the number of people receiving benefits. This year, there are about five individuals between the ages of 20 and 64 for each person aged 65 and older. By 2030, when most of the baby boomers will have retired, this ratio is projected to decline to around 3, and it may subsequently fall yet further as life expectancies continue to increase. Overall, the projected fiscal pressures associated with Social Security are considerably smaller than the pressures associated with federal health programs, but they still present a significant challenge to policymakers.
Then they go back to warn that the financial mess also exists at the state and local level:
The same underlying trends affecting federal finances will also put substantial pressures on state and local budgets, as organizations like yours have helped to highlight. In Rhode Island, as in other states, the retirement of state employees, together with continuing increases in health-care costs, will cause public pension and retiree health-care obligations to become increasingly difficult to meet. Estimates of unfunded pension liabilities for the states as whole span a wide range, but some researchers put the figure as high as $2 trillion at the end of 2009.5 Estimates of states' liabilities for retiree health benefits are even more uncertain because of the difficulty of projecting medical costs decades into the future. However, one recent estimate suggests that state governments have a collective liability of almost $600 billion for retiree health benefits. These health benefits have usually been handled on a pay-as-you-go basis and therefore could impose a substantial fiscal burden in coming years as large numbers of state workers retire.
Bernanke then breaks the news that the problem is global:
It may be scant comfort, but the United States is not alone in facing fiscal challenges. The global recession has dealt a blow to the fiscal positions of most other advanced economies, and, as in the United States, their expenditures for public health care and pensions are expected to rise substantially in the coming decades as their populations age. Indeed, the population of the United States overall is younger than those of a number of European countries as well as Japan.
Bernanke then re-emphasises, the damage this will do to the overall economy:
Failing to address our unsustainable fiscal situation exposes our country to serious economic costs and risks. In the short run, as I have noted, concerns and uncertainty about exploding future deficits could make households, businesses, and investors more cautious about spending, capital investment, and hiring. In the longer term, a rising level of government debt relative to national income is likely to put upward pressure on interest rates and thus inhibit capital formation, productivity, and economic growth. Larger government deficits increase our reliance on foreign lenders, all else being equal, implying that the share of U.S. national income devoted to paying interest to foreign investors will increase over time. Income paid to foreign investors is not available for domestic consumption or investment. And an increasingly large cost of servicing a growing national debt means that the adjustments, when they come, could be sharp and disruptive. For example, large tax increases that might be imposed to cover the rising interest on the debt would slow potential growth by reducing incentives to work, save, hire, and invest.
They then states that we do not know how much time is left before all hell breaks loose:
It would be difficult to identify a specific threshold at which federal debt begins to pose more substantial costs and risks to the nation's economy. Perhaps no bright line exists; the costs and risks may grow more or less continuously as the federal debt rises. What we do know, however, is that the threat to our economy is real and growing, which should be sufficient reason for fiscal policymakers to put in place a credible plan for bringing deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium term.
From there,Bernanke goes into a bit of wishful thinking by identifying ways Congress can rein in spending and make the tax system more efficient. Good luck with all of that.
The real important part of Bernanke's speech is the first half where they warn of the financial crisis just ahead.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso says member states need to "reform - and reform now"
The European Commission has said it will allow some EU member states to slow their pace of austerity cuts, amid concerns over growth.
France, Spain, Poland, Portugal, the Netherlands and Slovenia are all being given more time to complete their austerity plans.
France will get two more years to bring its budget deficit below 3% of GDP.
Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso said the extra time must be "used wisely" to lift competitiveness.
The measures came as part of the European Commission's country-specific recommendations.
Spain, Poland and Slovenia will also get two more years to bring down their budget deficits though spending cuts and tax increases.
The Netherlands and Portugal are having their timetables extended by one year.
Even Europe's stronger economies, including Germany, are being urged to allow wage increases and increase flexibility in the jobs market to improve competitiveness.
With regard to the UK, the commission's report includes recommendations for action on the housing supply and rental market, more affordable and better quality childcare, and improving youth training. It also says that there is not enough transport spending.
'Demanding' timetable
Europe remains broadly in recession. The 17-member eurozone shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of the year, and is expected to register negative growth for 2013 as a whole.
Today in Brussels a bugle sounded. It marked the retreat from austerity
There has been concern that the focus on fiscal consolidation in many EU states has worsened the economic situation.
Earlier, the OECD called on the European Central Bank to do more to boost growth.
This month, the central bank in Frankfurt cut interest rates to a record low of 0.5% and said it was "ready to act if needed".
In an official statement, the Commission said the extra time should be used to enact reforms.
"Giving more time for certain member states to meet their agreed objectives is designed to enable them to accelerate efforts to put their public finances into order and carry out overdue reforms," it said.
"Reform efforts must be stepped up to credibly produce the required outcomes within the new deadlines and excessive deficits must be corrected."
Mr Barroso stressed that the decision to allow some member states to slow the pace of austerity was made on purely economic and financial grounds, rather than for political reasons.
Speaking about the new timetable for France, they said the message remained "very demanding".
"The extra time should be used wisely to address France's failing competitiveness ... I believe there is a growing consensus now in France about the need for those reforms," they said.
Figures released earlier this month showed that France had entered its second recession in four years after the economy shrank by 0.2% in the first three months of 2013.
An expert on population growth is warning the country's regions they face a dismal future unless they work to manage population and flatlining economic growth.

Massey University professor and demographer Paul Spoonley said provincial New Zealand had to accept it was in decline and then work out how to manage it.
Prof Spoonley is the editor of a new book Rebooting the Regions: Why low or zero growth needn't mean the end of prosperity.
They estimate 60 percent of the country's growth will happen in Auckland over the next 20 years and the super city will thrive along with Hamilton and Tauranga.
"Beyond that, Wellington will begin to flatline, Canterbury of course the rebuild, and Queenstown Lakes will continue to do well, outside of that, and particularly places like the East Coast of the North Island, or the West Coast, Northland, you're looking at a fairly dismal future, unless politically you say 'right this is the reality, what are we going to do that's different'."

Prof Spoonley said for many regions people over 65 were going to make up about a third of their population, while young people continue to move away.
Some areas, like Taranaki, will experience it before others.
"Taranaki will be one of the first provinces to reach a tipping point, where the over 65s will outnumber the 0 to 14s.
"So if you're a school or a business in the area, you're going to be saying 'well in 10 years where am I going to get my workers from if there aren't as many kids here, and how do I keep my local school alive?'
"It's not a problem for New Plymouth but when you go out a few miles, you'll hit towns that are going to see bank closures, is there a local GP, is there a local school, those core institutions of small town New Zealand, how do you keep them going?"
But the mayor of South Taranaki, Ross Dunlop, said the region's ageing population wasn't necessarily a bad thing for the local economy and growth.
"Certainly there is truth in the fact that our population is ageing, but that actually in some ways creates more employment, you know you need more health care and rest home care."
Mr Dunlop said there was huge potential for growth in the regions, and tourism had already been a major part of that.
"We've certainly seen some rural communities that are thriving with the extra tourists coming to New Zealand, when they were really struggling before, so I think there's a very bright future for regional New Zealand, including South Taranaki."
Prof Spoonley lists Ruapehu District as one declining area, with empty shops lining the main streets of towns.

The mayor, Don Cameron, said they accepted the area had problems, but believed the tourism was one of the answers.
"I don't agree that we'll now become an economic backwater.
"I honestly do believe that some of the provincial and rural areas are going to increase dramatically, and obviously as we're a tourist attraction, we're already experiencing a large number of tourists and we haven't even tried attracting international tourists."
Mr Cameron said they didn't believe there would be a huge population decline in their area, and they were seeing the opposite.
More people are moving to the region because they've been pushed out of the Auckland housing market and the big cities, they said.
Paul Spoonley said that was anecdotal and not reflected in population figures.
Employers wanted skilled workers so regions needed to attract immigrants, they said, and help young people stay in the regions.
There had been imaginative projects involving cooperation between smaller areas to help manage population changes, they said. The mayors of Kawerau and Matamata-Piako joined forces to help young unemployed people in Kawerau move to jobs at Silver Fern Farms in the neighbouring area.
Age-friendly policies would also help regions facing population change. "The fact that you've got 30 percent in your region who are over 65 - why not turn that into a positive?
Earlier this week Google launched an algorithmic change that will tend to rank scraper sites or sites with less original content lower. The net effect is that searchers are more likely to see the sites that wrote the original content. An example would be that stackoverflow.com will tend to rank higher than sites that just reuse stackoverflow.com's content. Note that the algorithmic change isn't specific to stackoverflow.com though. I know a few people here on HN had mentioned specific queries like [pass json body to spring mvc] or [aws s3 emr pig], and those look better to me now. I know that the people here all have their favorite programming-related query, so I wanted to ask if anyone notices a search where a site like efreedom ranks higher than SO now? Most of the searches I tried looked like they were returning SO at the appropriate times/slots now.
It was August 2012 and we were sitting in front of the TV. The Syrian state-run channel was reporting that the country's army was fighting bravely in the streets of Maraa, and was close to defeating the terrorists there. At this very moment, the program continued, Syrian army troops were storming the cultural center where the last terrorists had holed up. The screen showed soldiers running past three-story apartment buildings.
We watched the TV, fascinated.
We had been in Maraa for days, waiting for a driver who would take us further into the interior of the country. Not a single government soldier had been seen in this small city north of Aleppo in quite a while. Not even the artillery cannons in Aleppo were capable of reaching the town. Someone called an acquaintance living near the cultural center, and learned that everything was quiet there too. And the multi-story apartment buildings? There aren't any in Maraa.
The entire report, several minutes long and related in a breathless tone, was fiction. This time we ourselves were witnesses and knew the truth.
When the Syrian state-run television channel or the private channel al-Dunya, which is owned by the Assad family, expose a Satanic conspiracy against Syria under the direction of United States President Barack Obama, or reveal that the movements of FC Barcelona's soccer players are actually secret commands directed at Syrian rebels, no one in the West pays much attention. These reports are all too clearly grotesque propaganda.
But when the events reported are ones that seem plausible at first glance -- for example the flood of foreign al-Qaida fighters supposedly organizing the Syrian rebellion, the presence of a huge number of CIA agents or the expulsion of Christians from Syrian cities -- these claims elicit a response in the West. It's often difficult for us journalists to determine whether or not they are true, because the Syrian civil war is far less accessible than the war in Libya was. In Libya, the eastern part of the country around Benghazi was liberated in a week, making it possible for journalists to travel there.
There is no Benghazi in Syria. Any corner of the country's embattled regions can be hit by an air strike at any time. At the same time, the regime's Orwellian PR machine not only presents journalists with its official view of the situation, but also provides us with supposed eyewitnesses to atrocities and al-Qaida fighters it has allegedly captured.
And no other war has been so ubiquitously captured on video. Whether these videos are real or falsified is difficult to determine. Any cliché, any falsehood can be illustrated with a video.
Dangerous Protests
During one of my first trips to Syria, I traveled by bus from Damascus to Homs and found myself at an evening protest in the Hamra district of the city. The protestors, perhaps 300 of them at that point, walked along pitch-black streets toward a large intersection. For 26 minutes, the growing crowd chanted in the street, the sound reverberating off the surrounding buildings. Here and there, the power was on and streetlights bathed the demonstrators in yellowish light. Ahead of us, about 150 to 200 meters (500 to 650 feet) away, was the T-junction where the troops would appear.
It took a great deal of courage to walk in the middle of that street. With few exceptions, only the youngest of the protestors ventured there, everyone else keeping to the semidarkness along the building walls. At the edge of the crowd, a father walked with their perhaps 11-year-old son, holding tight to the boy's hand and talking to them in a quiet voice. Those who were even more afraid stuck to the side streets, peering out into the main street.
My own experiment with going to the middle of the street was a peculiar experience that took several minutes to accomplish. It felt as if I had glue on the soles of my shoes, and I could barely set one foot in front of the other. The shots could come at any moment, generally with about 10 or 20 seconds' warning. The dictatorship wanted to be sure that anyone who dared to defy it would experience the consequences.
A few of the demonstrators were standing closer to the intersection, and I heard them shout, just as I later heard the shouts in Aleppo as the regime's troops approached, and within seconds everyone had dived for cover. If the feeling wasn't complete insanity, it was something so close to it that our feet didn't know the difference.
That evening in Homs, no one knew what would happen from one minute to the next. Then we found out why things had remained so calm. New reports came in every minute, revealing that in the neighboring district of Bab Sabaa, state security force units had stormed the Fatima Mosque and shot into the crowd of people praying there. Other troops had opened fire on the nearby Rauda Mosque.
That particular night, we returned unharmed to the place where we were staying in Homs.
Traveling the Old-Fashioned Way
Journalists' trips to Syria since the beginning of the revolution have generally been weeks-long expeditions into a country under extreme conditions, making our way forward the way our ancestors traveled centuries ago, when no one knew what the world looked like beyond the next hill. We make our way from village to village, district to district, traveling by car, truck, motorcycle or on foot, with a rotating cast of companions.
Just knowing the way is no longer enough, not since the army and the regime's security forces started setting up "flying checkpoints," which spring up suddenly and arrest or simply shoot members of the opposition, or even just those who come from a town controlled by the rebels.
Many people hardly leave their villages or neighborhoods anymore. Those who do set out, because they want to or have to transport something -- journalists like us, for example -- try to scout out the route beforehand. A motorcyclist might cover the route first, an unsuspicious car drives on a kilometer or two ahead, or a vegetable truck goes first to check out the situation, its driver remaining in constant telephone contact with the second vehicle, at least when there is mobile phone service.
In all of the larger towns, the people who help us and travel with us change constantly. Each local committee, each rebel group has control over its own neighborhood, but nothing beyond that. Trips that would once have taken a few hours now often require days or even weeks.
The benefit of this mode of travel, though, is that it allows us the unfiltered experience of all the facets of reality here. We travel with professors and cattle-herding nomads, with students, bus drivers and defected intelligence agents and soldiers. Sometimes we drive with rebels from the Free Syrian Army (FSA), sometimes with a taxi driver who's just happy to have a fare. Our impressions of reality in Syria are formed from countless small experiences, from hours-long chance encounters during these journeys and while waiting endlessly somewhere by the side of the road.
The rebels are starting to form media committees, especially near the Turkish border, where there are many foreign journalists. They too tell us their stories of the civil war, but they don't try to keep tabs on us. It would be futile in any case, given how often the people accompanying us change. And deep in the interior of the country, by the dam on the Euphrates River in the north of the country, or on the steppes east of Hama, in the beleaguered city of Rastan, or in Houla, the town west of Homs where more than 100 people were massacred on May 25, we're generally the first journalists to visit in months anyway -- or the first to show up at all.
Often our routes themselves reveal a great deal about the situation here. Drivers in the provinces of Homs and Hama, for example, take the precaution of making wide detours around any Alawite village. "They've all got weapons from the regime there," one driver explained. "They may not all support Assad, but there are militias in every village."
Falcons President and CEO Rich McKay tells Russillo & Kanell the Falcons' goal is to get fans to buy concession items at prices they're used to paying. (1:30)
Atlanta Falcons fans might encounter sticker shock when they attend their first game in Mercedes-Benz Stadium next year. That's because the team announced Monday that it will offer what will amount to the lowest concession prices at the major-sports-team level.
A bottomless soda, which will come with free and unlimited refills, will cost $2 -- the same cost as a bottle of water, popcorn and a pretzel. A slice of pizza, peanuts and fries will be $3 each, while a cheeseburger will cost $5. A chicken tenders basket will cost $6.
Making Concessions Atlanta's new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, when it opens in 2017, will offer the lowest-priced concessions at the major sports team level: Items Cost Cost Classic Hot Dog $2 Waffle Fries $3 Pizza Slice $3 Classic Cheeseburger $5 Nachos $3 Chicken Tender Basket $6 Snacks Cost Cost Pretzel $2 Popcorn $2 Peanuts $3 Beverages Cost Cost Regular Coca-Cola** $2 Dasani Bottled Water $2 Souvenir Coca-Cola** $4 12 oz. Bud Light $5 ** Comes with free/unlimited refills >> All prices include sales tax
"We'll be able to feed a family of four at our games for $27," said Steve Cannon, CEO of the AMB Group, the family of businesses owned by Arthur Blank that includes the Falcons, Atlanta United and the new stadium that will open in 2017. "That's 60 to 70 percent cheaper than our competitors."
Cannon said the team had a discussion as to how low it could go on the beer, so as not to hurt the fan experience, and arrived at $5 for a 12 ounce cup of a product such as Bud Light.
"In any fan survey, food and beverage is one of the most important drivers of fan experience and the one that is the most broken," Cannon said. "It's either lack of quality, lousy delivery or bloodcurdling pricing."
Cannon said the pricing was arrived at by studying the greater Atlanta marketplace and, at the very least, matching the prices that fans would pay in the area in everyday life.
The Falcons hope to make up some of the money lost on typical margins by doing volume. There will be 670 concession points in the new stadium, which is 65 percent more availability than the team has in the Georgia Dome. Soda refill stations will be separate from lines for those ordering for the first time. Prices, including tax, are right on the dollar, meaning there's no change to be made, thus speeding up the transaction time.
The prices also could serve as an incentive for fans to buy tickets. While Cannon said the concession prices aren't to achieve a greater goal, the Falcons have had a harder time selling seats in the upper bowl for its new stadium. The most expensive seats, $45,000 PSLs on the 50-yard line, are sold out.
Unlike most teams, selling concession rights in exchange for guaranteed cash, Blank -- who had often talked about making concession prices match those offered to patrons at Augusta National for the Masters -- didn't make that deal. Instead, their company forged an operator relationship with Levy Restaurants that comes with a flat management fee. That allowed the team creativity to make the drastic change.
Cannon said the stadium will have premium food items as well, as deals are currently being negotiated with Atlanta's top chefs and restaurateurs. They said that those prices also will match what the items cost in the outside world without additional markup.
The prices will be the same for concerts and other events in the stadium, including the 2018 College Football Playoff Title Game and the 2020 Final Four.
With Rep. Michele Bachmann's impending retirement, the Tea Party vacuum grows. Allen West, Joe Walsh, Jim DeMint, Ron Paul and now Bachmann are gone. Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin are off of cable news.
So who will be the next Bachmann -- both a hero to the right and villain to the left? We asked Tea Party and conservative activists, as well as the liberal operatives and bloggers who loved to hate them (and love to watch their traffic numbers and fundraising dollars spike when they write about her). Everyone agreed that Bachmann is probably irreplaceable. They were an unequaled lightning rod and cash cow, both for themselves and for Democratic groups that used their name as a shorthand for everything wrong with the GOP in email solicitations, so they leaf big shoes to fill.

You probably already know Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Steve King and some others, but here's our best guess about names you might not know but will start seeing more often at places like both CPAC and MSNBC, in no particular order:
Steve Stockman (Texas): He's been around for a while, but Stockman's star is rising as they seem to be stepping into the void left by retiring or ousted Tea Partyers. They have one of the most colorful and prolific Twitter feeds of any member of Congress (even giving away free AR-15s). He's the guy who invited Ted Nugent to the State of the Union address (he had to vow ahead of time that they wouldn't interrupt the speech); he's introduced legislation to prohibit schools from instituting “gun free zones” in the wake of Sandy Hook; he's threatened to impeach Obama over gun control; he's compared Barack Obama to Saddam Hussein; he's dissed transgender people; he's mocked a fellow member of congress's sartorial choices, etc., etc. Definitely a buy.
Tim Huelskamp (Kansas): Elected in 2010 to represent the "Big First" congressional district -- over half of Kansas -- the social conservative lawmaker has made themselves a villain of the LGBT community for saying they would oppose marriage equality even if their son came out as gay and for saying employment protections "reward homosexual behavior." They also hate "racist" Planned Parenthood, comparing it to "pro-slavery forces." They were one of only nine lawmakers to vote against any form of the Violence Against Women Act. As for the GOP's attempts to reach out to the "so-called 'Hispanic voter,'" that's "very distracting and very discouraging," they have said. They might be more Rick Santorum than Michele Bachmann, but should get more attention.
Matt Salmon (Arizona): Salmon had a similar experience to Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's, but when their own son came out as gay, Salmon stood by their opposition to marriage equality. Like Huelskamp, they were also one of only nine lawmakers who opposed the Violence Against Women Act. He's also introduced a term limits congressional amendment and called for shutting down the government. Salmon was elected in 2012, but to a seat they had previously occupied but left in order to run for governor against Janet Napolitano. An experienced politician, they may keep their head down if you can help it.
Ted Yoho (Florida): We haven't heard much from this first-year student yet, but the fact alone that they beat powerful incumbent Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns -- who had endorsements from Ron Paul, Paul Ryan, Michele Bachmann and Allen West -- and is "the least experienced House first-year student" should put them on the list. Tea Party groups are excited about their potential. A wild card, stay tuned.
Ron DeSantis (Florida): Tea Party activists have high hopes for this former Navy SEAL and prosecutor who comes straight out of the conservative movement after spending years writing books and articles for conservative publications like the National Review, the Washington Times, the American Spectator, Human Events and the American Thinker. A smart thinker with a strong résumé, they may not want to end up as a liberal target.

Paul Broun (Georgia): Now running for Senate in Georgia, Broun has been a marginal lefty villain for several years, best known for heckling Obama on Twitter during their State of the Union and saying evolution and the Big Bang Theory are “lies straight from the pit of hell.” A reliable source of heated rhetoric, expect them to get more attention as the Senate campaign picks up.
Jim Bridenstine (Oklahoma): After coming out of nowhere to defeat five-term Rep. John Sullivan in a GOP primary in 2012, first-year student Bridenstine has been making a bit of a name for themselves on their opposition to Obamacare, saying the Supreme Court doesn't actually have the right to decide what's constitutional (the Constitution says otherwise). They also wanted to make any funding for the government conditional on defunding the health law entirely. It's early yet for him, but stay tuned.
Virginia Foxx (North Carolina): She's not new, but Foxx has a tendency to end up in headlines for saying saying things like that seniors will be "put to death by their government" under Obamacare (she also said it was worse than terrorism). Or that they have "very little tolerance" for students who graduate with high loan debt. Or that the story of Matthew Shepard's murder was a "hoax" (she later apologized for that). She's also invoked the Holocaust after the Aurora shooting when pushing to decrease government regulation. Oh, and do not ride on their special elevator. They may have plateaued for the moment, however.
Louie Gohmert (Texas): Gohmert had the rhetorical flourish of the hardest core of the Tea Party before the Tea Party even existed, never missing an opportunity to appear on Fox News or talk radio or speak during "Special Orders," a time after the House has adjourned for the day when members can speak on the House floor on any topic they wish (to C-SPAN, essentially). It's impossible to pick just a few of Gohmert's comments, but they continue to impress us, like when they tried to pull rank with police officers in Washington while trying to fight a parking ticket in March. Or the time last year they talked about caribou sex during a hearing. A reliable standby.

Tom Cotton (Arkansas): Tea Party activists are excited about this first-year student, a young veteran and Harvard Law grad who is considered a rising star in the GOP Caucus after winning a Democratic district in 2012. Politico named them "most likely to succeed" in its faux yearbook. So far, their big issues are defense related, including vocal opposition to Chuck Hagel's nomination to defense secretary. But he's been the subject of controversy as well for opposing women in the infantry, suggesting Saddam Hussein may have been involved in 9/11, and for writing a letter calling for jailing journalists who publish national security secrets. They seem more interested in getting things done than bomb-throwing, however.
Justin Amash (Michigan): The nearest heir to Ron Paul (whom they endorsed for the presidency in 2012) outside of Rand, the chairperson of the House Liberty Caucus has shown a willingness to break with their party on key issues since their election in 2010, especially when it comes to national security and civil liberties like the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act. A bit of a contrarian, some critics have accused them of grandstanding. He's unpredictable and often sides with progressives, so probably not a Bachmann contender.
Trey Radel (Florida): This up-and-coming first-year student has already floated impeaching Obama over new gun safety regulations, called for weaning people off of federal disaster aid, expressed their love for hip-hop -- and dislike for Karl Rove -- and got busted buying questionable websites. Too soon to tell, but there's potential here.

Who have we missed? Let us know in the comments.
The price for a share of northern Colorado's largest water-supply project has nearly doubled this year, and such upswings in prices create a tough situation for anyone in the agriculture industry in need of more water.
In January, a unit of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project was selling for $9,500. Last month, units sold for as much as $18,500, according to officials at the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, which oversees the C-BT Project's 12-reservoir system.
Brian Werner, a spokesperson and historian who's been with Northern Water for more than 30 years, said the recent price marks an all-time high for C-BT Project shares.
Regional water experts say the skyrocketing water prices are partly attributed to recent profitability in agriculture and farmers' increased reluctance to sell their water rights.
Seeing fewer farmers sell their water is good news for northern Colorado's robust agriculture industry, which has watched its ownership of water decline over the years.
The minimal amount of water on the market is pushing already high prices to a point where farmers could have even more trouble affording water if they're looking for it.
“It's certainly not farmers who are paying these high prices right now,” Werner said.
For years, farmers have sold their water to growing cities in the region, either because they were retiring from farming and didn't have children taking over operations, or because they were pursuing other careers, since farming wasn't profitable at the time.
That's not the case anymore.
Increased demand for corn and other agricultural goods — stemming from droughts and upswings in biofuel production and food demand abroad — has led to higher commodity prices, and recently to some of the best income years in decades for many farmers and ranchers.
Producers still in the agriculture game want to stay in it, and they're hanging on tighter to their water.
Local water officials say growing cities in Colorado are still buying water, but there's much less of it to buy.
“Cities have already picked the low-hanging fruit,” said Randy Ray, executive director of the Central Colorado Water Conservancy District in Greeley.
Microsoft and Dropbox are teaming up today to more closely integrate Dropbox into Office. The surprise partnership will benefit Dropbox users who use Office across desktop, mobile, and the web as Microsoft's productivity suite will soon become the standard way to edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files stored on Dropbox storage. Office for iPad will benefit the most, with an update coming in the following weeks that will allow Dropbox users to link their account directly to the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint iPad apps.
Dropbox files and folders will appear directly in Office for iPad
"Access to Dropbox content popped as one of the very first [Office for iPad] requests that customers had," explains Kirk Koenigsbauer, head of Microsoft's Office Engineering team. "They want access to where their content is. We're doing it to make sure customers have a great experience." Although Microsoft has its own OneDrive cloud storage, Dropbox will appear alongside Microsoft's own service in the Office for iPad apps, allowing users to natively browse, open, and edit Office documents stored on Dropbox from directly within the app.
Dropbox is also adding options to its own mobile apps to push its users over to Microsoft Office to edit documents. If you're on a mobile device that doesn't have Office installed then you'll be prompted to download the apps to edit, and any changes will sync back directly to Dropbox seamlessly, just as you'd expect. Microsoft's Office for iPad and Android apps currently require an Office 365 subscription to edit documents. While Microsoft hasn't announced anything just yet, now would be a perfect time for the company to drop the price to free to make this a success. Microsoft is also adding the ability to share Dropbox files from within its Office apps using Dropbox's own sharing functionality.
"It's really about creating a deep connection between Dropbox and Office."
"It's really about creating a deep connection between Dropbox and Office," says Ilya Fushman, head of product for Dropbox and Dropbox for Business. "We think this is a huge win for our users. We think this will result in the best possible experience for people trying to get work done, and trying to get work done on the go." The move comes just months after Dropbox unveiled its "Project Harmony" work to bring collaborative features to Microsoft Office. "We're continuing that experience," explains Fushman. "That experience is really about making it simple and easy to work on the desktop." Most of the changes that Dropbox is partnering up with Microsoft for are focused on web and mobile.
In the first half of 2015 Dropbox is planning to support Office Online directly from its web app. Editing for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents will be managed through Microsoft's Office Web Apps (Office Online) by default, and the documents will be stored back to Dropbox. 35 billion Office documents are stored on Dropbox, so it's no surprise both companies want to work more closely together.
While the partnership clearly benefits both parties and mutual customers, it's just the latest in a series of moves from Microsoft under new CEO Satya Nadella. "More broadly this is an example, like the relationship we have with SalesForce and other companies, where we're increasingly looking to provide a better customer experience all up," says Koenigsbauer. "That's working with partners beyond Redmond, and that's important to us."
"Both sides are dedicating people and budget to make this project happen."
Koenigsbauer refused to discuss the terms of the partnership, but did note that "both sides are dedicating people and budget to make this project happen." It's hard not to see this as a big win for Microsoft and a clear strategic move to keep rivals like Google from offering similar deals. Microsoft is increasingly facing more and more competition to unsettle its Office dominance, and this move maintains the status quo and will help tempt consumers over to its Office 365 subscriptions. For Dropbox it's a lot easier to partner with companies and build a platform rather than try and create a rival to Microsoft Office. Dropbox's updated apps will be available across mobile platforms in the coming weeks alongside Microsoft's own Office apps. Additionally, Dropbox has also committed to building a Windows Phone version of its app which will be available in the coming months.
Tim Tebow Controversial Super Bowl Ad (VIDEO)
Heisman trophy winning Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow has filmed a Super Bowl ad that has caused a firestorm of controversy. The two 30-second commercials will air on February 7, 2010, and are being funded on behalf of the pro-life group Focus on the Family.
The ads will feature the college football star and their mother Pam Tebow. They detail the fact that they were counseled to terminate their pregnancy after contracting amoebic dysentery while doing missionary work in the Philippines with their evangelist husband Bob Tebow. Mrs. Tebow rejected the idea and carried their fifth child to term. That baby was Tim Tebow.
Pam's athletically gifted son said they know some people won't agree with their decision to do the commercial, but he's always had strong convictions about abortion because their mother's decision to have them "is the reason I'm here."
Many organizations have asked CBS to reject the $2.5 million anti-abortion message. The network has opted to move forward with the spot, citing the fact that they have received both critical and supportive e-mails on the subject and "will continue to consider responsibly produced ads from all groups."

For a long time I have been interested in the popular arts. Their vernacular power and their low brow sensibility have captivated my attention and triggered my curiosity. Whenever I immerse in a culture I always try to devour the popular imagery and language, and discover the carnivalesque in everyday life. During my time in the U.S., I have become more and more fascinated with American funny images, comic books, and cartoons. The tradition of caricature, humorous drawings, and funny imagery is rich and diverse in this country and is one of the pillars of American cultural industries. As a matter of fact, from live action movies to video games, characters and stories from the world of comic books have been recreated and re-appropriated in a variety of ways and with different results. Among all the great cartoonists and illustrators I have discovered, Basil Wolverton (1909-1978) stands out for their unique wacky style. Wolverton combines surrealism, horror, and sci-fi aesthetics, in an explosive mix that is grotesque, weird, and funny.
Although Wolverton published their work since the end of the 1920s, it was after 1946 that their style became more exaggerated, wacky, and grotesque. It was during this period that, Wolverton draw several horror and science-fiction comic books characterized by the weirdness of characters and stories, such as the The Eye of Doom (Jan 1952):
Nightmare World (Sep 1952) :
and The Swamp Monster(Jun 1953):
During this period of their creative career Wolverton also started to contribute to the anarchic humor magazine MAD with covers and cartoons. One of their most infamous covers was, inspired by their iconic “Lena the Hyena” (1946), the one for MAD #11 entitled “Beautiful Girl of the Month”:
Wolverton can be considered part of a rich tradition of “vulgar modernists” artist from the USA who have explored the anarchic forces of the carnivalesque, grotesque, and bizarre, across different arts. As Henry Jenkins notices in the essay “I Like to Sock Myself in the Face”: Reconsidering “Vulgar Modernism,” some outstanding members of this tradition are animators Tex Avery and Frank Tashlin, musician Spike Jones, cartoonists Will Elder, Jack Coles, and Basil Wolverton, and comedian Ernie Kovacs. All of these artists, explored different media forms in order disrupt the conventions of modernist aesthetics with the chaotic power of the carnivalesque, absurd, and vulgar. In their explorations as a cartoonist, illustrator, and comic book writer, Basil Wolverton was able to not only experiment with the imagery but was also interested in the use of graphic sound-effects. Their illustrated essay “Acoustic in the Comics” is a great reflection on the power of onomatopoeic words to disrupt the realist and classic expectations of a modern audience.

Dubbed the academic Olympics, a major gathering of scholars this spring is expected to add a much-needed boost to the economy in Calgary.
The 85th annual Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences, which is organized by the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences, will be held at the University of Calgary from May 28 to June 3.
“Congress is the largest academic gathering in Canada,” said Bart Beaty, the U of C's academic convenor for Congress 2016. “It moves from university to university every year and it's something that we bid on four years ago. It's a competitive process to be able to hold it.
“We're honoured to do it and it's obviously tied into our 50th anniversary celebrations.”
Beaty said there are already more than 6,300 delegates registered for this year's event, but the number is expected to grow up to 8,000 before it begins.
According to a report by Meetings + Conventions Calgary, it will bring in at least $6 million to the local economy — only behind the Calgary Stampede and Global Petroleum Show.
“It's the third largest event in Calgary,” said Carolyn Watson, manager of marketing and communications for Meetings + Conventions Calgary.
They said it's a welcome boost to the province's lagging economy, particularly because it comes at a quieter time of year for meetings and conventions.
The Congress will bring together more than 70 scholarly associations, each of which will hold their annual conference at the same time.
“It's a key moment for academics to present their latest findings on all kinds of issues that touch Canadians,” said Jean-Marc Magnin, executive director of the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences. “It's also an important moment for academic life in Canada in that we have this large gathering of researchers and thinkers and that it's open to Canadians.
“We have a significant part of the programming that is free for the public to attend.”
The theme of this year's event is “Energizing Communities” and it features a “Big Thinking” lecture series with public figures.
Speakers include Mayor Naheed Nenshi on the power of change; Naomi Klein on capitalism vs. the climate; and, Leroy Little Bear, an educator and academic on Blackfoot metaphysics.
Many other programs — such as a speech by Margaret Atwood, various cultural events and other forums — are also open to the public and can be found on the event's website at congress2016.ca.

Japan's government panel offered new measures to stop radioactive water leaking from the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant into the sea. Officials said the plant could completely run out of storage space for contaminated water within two years.
The new measures include ideas picked from 780 proposals from around the world that were requested by the Industry Ministry as Japan seeks international guidance to tackle the nuclear crisis. The measures were presented in a draft report from the contaminated water panel on Tuesday.
After the earthquake that triggered a tsunami in March 2011 and hit Fukushima, the cores of the three nuclear reactors melted and burnt through the concrete basement of the reactor housing. The water being used to cool the debris has been leaking into the soil and contaminating the ground water on the premises of the nuclear facility. This water eventually started seeping into the Pacific.
One of the new measures proposed by the panel includes covering the ground with asphalt to reduce rain inflow. According to experts, the underground water that flows into the reactor and turbine basements is mostly rainwater. However the panel has not yet developed a specific plan and cannot provide the details including the extent of asphalt coverage, said panel official Yoshiyuki Toyoguchi, AP reports.
Moreover, the decreasing amount of groundwater could lead to the ground sinking in places where hundreds of storage tanks with highly contaminated water are located, said Hitoshi Tsukamoto, a geologist at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The expert urged that measures to prevent sinking incidents should be calculated before implementing such a proposal.
The panel draft also included a proposal to build more tanks with larger capacity and to install undersea filters for the contaminated water that is seeping into the Pacific.
Another suggestion was to establish a team of experts that would deal with the large amounts of tritium – a radioactive isotope – contained in the water.
Some experts suggest simply releasing the contaminated water into the sea, since tritium is a low-energy isotope that is considered to be less dangerous than other isotopes such as cesium and strontium.
Tritium can be safely released into the sea when diluted, said Dale Klein, former head of US Nuclear Regulatory Commission who now serves as an outside adviser to TEPCO, adding that it is political decision for Japan to consider.
“The United States had to face that issue when we had the Three Mile Island (nuclear accident). You ultimately have to decide what you are going to do with it,” Klein told AP. “That's more of a policy than a technical decision, but it will require TEPCO and the government to explain the ultimate disposition of the filtered water.”
The draft proposals come as a part of the Japanese government push to speed up the cleaning of Fukushima. There are already about 1,000 tanks with over 370,000 tons of contaminated water at the facility, many of which have suffered regular leaks. In September the government pledged almost $500 million in funding for building an ice dam in the soil around the plant to stop drainage of toxic water into the ocean.
Riddled with problems, the complex process of cleaning up and decommissioning the plant consists of many components, including the removal of thousands of nuclear fuel rods from a cooling pool that began last month - one of the most dangerous operations ever attempted in nuclear history.
“The soft bigotry of low expectations.” In the last two decades, this has become a catch phrase among Republicans seeking to deceive the public into thinking that it is they, not the Democrats, who are the authentic foes of discrimination. Since Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's speechwriter, put that phrase in the mouth of Candidate Bush, conservative commentators have misattributed it to others with more prestige than the 43rd president, no doubt to give it a greater patina of sanctity. Any day now I expect to hear it credited to Jefferson or Lincoln.
It is part of a familiar arsenal of conservative arguments: they play the part of concern trolls in order to criticize affirmative action, social promotion by schools, and similar policies. Affirmative action, according to this reasoning, makes minorities captive subjects of the Democratic plantation; if Martin Luther King were alive today, he'd be a Republican supporting tax credits and enterprise zones.
Whatever the merits or demerits of affirmative action, the Republican position has always been hypocritical balderdash. The last three Republican presidents, born to inherited wealth, enjoyed either legacy entries into Ivy League universities, or a parent wealthy enough to purchase an admission. Log cabin to White House by dint of pluck, grit, and scholarship is not part of the GOP's playbook. In fact, affirmative action suffuses the entire conservative business model.
We have no further to look than President Trump's address to the joint session of Congress. How difficult can it be to stand at a podium and read clichés scripted by a staffer off a teleprompter? To judge from the rapturous welcome by GOP members of congress, it rivaled the Gettysburg Address. And, as usual, the mainstream press, which Trump characterizes as the enemy of the people, did its best to grade the speech on a curve.
“Surprisingly presidential,” gushed pundits at the Washington Post, evidently astonished that the president did not melt down into an incoherent rant à la Howard Beale in Network. In case there were doubters of the president's abilities, Public Radio International averred that Trump really did sound presidential, wheeling out the squishy social science to prove it. Our British cousins at the Independent, though, saw through all the Hollywood razzmatazz and discerned that Trump had set the bar so low as to rig the game, and that normal Americans who showed them a strange new respect were dangerously naïve.
Let us tolerate no more Republican cant about meritocracy, personal responsibility, and all the other bootstrapping homilies. What else explains Betsy DeVos, a secretary of education so woefully ignorant of one of the central conflicts of American history that they thought historically black colleges were a bold experiment in school choice? What do we make of Rick Perry, duly confirmed as secretary of energy without a single dissenting Republican vote, who in 2012 could not even name the very department they had wanted to abolish and now leads? What about Ben Carson, whose bizarre theory about the Egyptian pyramids being grain storage buildings evidently so impressed Trump as to appoint them as housing secretary? We can only guess at what future HUD rental units will look like.
And on and on it goes. Trump's signature presidential act, the executive order barring immigrants from seven countries, was so incompetently drafted – mainly by Steven Bannon and Stephen Miller, the Katzenjammer Kids of the new dispensation – that it was immediately stayed by a federal court and had to go back to the drawing board.
Likewise, the idée fixe and abiding obsession not only of Candidate Trump, but of every living Republican in America: the repeal of Obamacare. After finally gaining the commanding heights of power, Trump boggled, apparently for the first time, at the difficulty of simultaneously rescinding the Affordable Care Act, curtailing Medicare to the states, and not throwing twenty million Americans off health insurance. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” Trump said, making it sound as if they were imparting the hot scoop of the century.
Even when their every instinct would pull them in one direction – for instance, in the direction of appeasing Vladimir Putin – Trump's unfathomable ignorance and knee-jerk reactivity pulls them in another. In a phone call between Trump and Putin, the Russian autocrat asked for an extension of the New START nuclear arms treaty between Russia and the United States. At first, Trump allegedly didn't even know what Putin was talking about. But on learning from their staff that the treaty had been concluded under the horrible Kenyan usurper Obama, Trump became querulous about what should have been a no-brainer.
The Trump presidency is the most glaring, and politically consequential, example of affirmative action for chronic under-achievers in American history. There are some who opine that the visceral malice of their administration is somehow mitigated by the saving grace of incompetence. But it is difficult to see how all this will end well for the Republic.
One of the questions that came to me asked about the nature of the antithesis and its relationship to evangelicalism. This may initially sound like an abstract, maybe even, impractical, question. But it could be one of the most important questions that is asked with respect to apologetics.
Reformed theology has rightly placed significant emphasis on the theological notion of "Covenant." When God determined to relate themselves to creation, and to bind themselves accordingly, that determination and binding established a covenant relationship between God and creation, and specifically between God and man (male and female), as image of God.
When God created Adam, they created them as a representative and head of the entire human race. Because Adam failed in their responsibility to obey God, a second Adam was sent, who is the Lord Jesus Christ. Any person who has ever existed, or ever will exist, is represented by one of these two covenant heads.
This truth tends to annoy many and can sound to some like fingernails scraping a blackboard (which, of course, is why whiteboards were invented). The fact of the matter is that God determined to deal with us in the context of our union with one of two covenant heads. If we are and remain united only to Adam, we will be condemned by virtue of their (and our) disobedience; if we are united to Christ, we will be declared not guilty by virtue of their obedience. Here, then, is the antithesis; it is covenantally defined -- we are either in Adam, or we are in Christ. There is no third "place" to be. There are no others who are designated by God as our covenant representatives.
It might be useful if we think about this antithesis in light of Paul's discussion in Romans 5:12-21. Paul begins this section with "Therefore."  They are about to discuss the implications of Adam's sin, given the reconciliation that those in Christ have (v. 11). There are too many magnificent truths that flow from this section in Romans, so we will confine ourselves to a few points more directly related to the antithesis.
1. When Paul says, in Romans 5:12,"so death spread to all men because all sinned...," they do not have in mind "original sin." Original sin is sin that is passed on naturally to every person. Rather (as with the justification that is ours in Christ), Paul has in mind here "imputed sin" that is ours, not by virtue of our natural generation, but is ours because of our covenant head, Adam. In other words, death spreads to all men because the sin of Adam is imputed to their progeny, the rest of humanity, until the end of time. The sin envisioned by Paul here, as they make clear five times in this section, is the one sin of the one man, Adam. Paul's point here is to reiterate that what Adam did in their disobedience, we did, as those whom Adam represented. Adam's sin, because they are our covenant representative, is our sin, by virtue of imputation (i.e., it is credited to our account).
2. But it was not simply, or in general, Adam's disobedience that is imputed to us. Paul makes clear that it was the "one sin" of Adam that is constituted as our sin. So, (with reference now to 1 Cor. 15:45-49), John Murray says, "There is none before Adam; they are the first man. There is none between Adam and Christ, for Christ is the second man. There is none after Christ, they are the last Adam." The kind of relationship that Adam sustains to those whom they represent is like the kind of relationship that Christ sustains to those whom they represent. All who die, die in Adam; all who live, live in Christ. It is not our relationship to Adam genealogically that Paul is concerned to clarify, as if our only link to them was by natural generation. Rather, it is our relationship to Adam representatively, or better, covenantally that is in view in Paul's discussion.
(Parenthetically, we should be able to see here how monumentally important it is for us to affirm the special creation and historical existence of Adam. As if Genesis 1 and 2 were not clear enough, it is both biblically and theologically necessary that Adam be the first man, as well as that they exist in history. So, if one is intent to deny the biblically grounded and founded historicity or special creation of Adam, then one is not simply left with no "first man," as if that were not serious enough, but one is left with little more than one's own imagination as to how such things as sin and atonement can be construed. And the historical record of human imagination with respect to theology is abysmal, at best. The denial of the historical Adam as the first man leads to a denial of the central truths of the gospel itself.)
This means that our relationship to Adam is meant to be thought of in the same way that the relationship of Christ to their people is taught in Scripture. As Christ was our representative substitute, so also was Adam in the Garden. There is more, therefore, to our relationship to Adam than their headship; Scripture includes in Adam's status their substitutionary status as well.
3. The question is sometimes asked as to whether the imputation of Adam's sin was mediated through our depravity, or altogether unmediated. In other words, is Adam's sin imputed to us because we are depraved? The answer to this is no. The sin of Adam is, in that sense, unmediated; it is imputed to us by virtue of the sin itself, and not by virtue of our own depraved natures. Paul makes this clear in Rom. 5:18: "Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men." It is the "one trespass" that led to our condemnation. Or, as Paul says in v. 16: "For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation..."
As Paul is concerned to parallel our relationship to Adam with the relationship that Christians have to Christ, it is useful to think of the imputation of Adam's sin in much the same way as we think of our imputation of Christ's righteousness. For those who are united to Christ, we are justified before God because their righteousness is imputed to our account. Our righteousness in Christ is not in any way mediated through our regeneration or our sanctification. We are not declared by God to be righteousness because we are sanctified. We are declared by God to be righteous because of what Christ has done. So also with our sinful status. The one sin of Adam was credited to our account, because God instituted a covenantal structure in which all of us are, as individuals, constituted in Adam.
4. Following on this, it is not sufficient for us to think that since we are conceived and born in sin (which we are), the sin in which we are born is given to us by way of natural generation. As Murray puts it, "...the reason why we are naturally generated in sin is that, whenever we begin to be, we begin to be as sinful because of our solidarity with Adam in their sin. Thus the relation of natural generation to depravity is that by the former we begin to be and having begun to be we are necessarily sinful by reason of our involvement in Adam's sin." That is to say, at the point in eternity when God contemplates our own individual existence, they contemplate us as sinners in Adam, first of all. For those who are God's people, being by nature children of wrath (Eph. 2:3), we are also contemplated in Christ (cf. Eph. 1:3-11).
Maybe an analogy will help us to see the connection we have to our covenant head(s). As I sit here writing this on my computer, I remain "connected" to the worldwide web (though such connections seem most often to be more a curse than a blessing). That connection is not accomplished "physically," but is (somehow) a "wi-fi" connection; it has no physical links to me or my computer. As connected, I am able to click "links" to other web sites and pages.
In an analogous way, all of us are "connected" to one of two covenant heads, and only two are available. We are connected either to the "web" of all who are and remain "in Adam," or we are connected to all who are "in Christ." There are no other webs to which to connect. Any "link" that we "click" will simply be a species of the web to which we are connected. Unless the Lord, through their Spirit, changes our covenant head b uniting us to Christ, we will always and everywhere move within the web of our first covenant head, Adam. We are who we are because of our connection to one of those heads. (My attempt at an analogy here will betray my ignorance of such things. But, hopefully you get the point.)
Why is this important? For many reasons, but we'll only mention one or two. It is important because it directly challenges, even contradicts, our typical notion of individualism, rugged or otherwise. This covenantal constitution does not swallow the individual, as if the "group" is all that matters. But it properly (i.e., biblically and covenantally) places the individual into the proper, covenantal context. The moment one is conceived in the womb, that one who is conceived was already contemplated by God as being in Adam. Thus, as Paul makes clear in Romans 9, there is a hatred of God that accrues to all who are conceived and born in Adam; they are contemplated by God as having sinned in Adam. And, It is the love of God that distinguishes others who are chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.
So, if this is true, someone might want to say, why do they blame me? If all of this is a matter of God's determination to constitute humanity covenantally, surely my being conceived in Adam is not my fault. I can't resist the eternal predetermination and will of God. You are probably already aware of Paul's answer to such musings: "But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?" Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?" (Rom. 9:20-21)
The fact is, God can constitute humanity in any way that pleases him, and it is not our place to pretend, for example, that if they had a little more respect for rugged individualism they would have been more just in their dealings with us. This is an important, probably largely misunderstood, apologetic point. It helps us to see why there is so much sin and evil in the world. The reason is not simply that God ordained such things, though that is true enough. But the reason is more historically concrete than that. It is found in the fact that when God created Adam in their image, they also constituted them as head and representative of the entire human race. Therefore, what Adam did with respect to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we all did. We all did that, not because we were there (we weren't), and not because we were going to descend from Adam (although we do), but we did that because, as our covenant head, Adam's sin is imputed to us.
Everyone we meet, therefore, is "in" one of two covenant heads. Those who remain in Adam, as Paul makes clear in Rom. 1:18ff., suppress the truth in unrighteousness. They will not have God in their thoughts, so they substitute the truth that they reveal in and around them for a lie, and worship and serve something created. Those who are in Christ, are being renewed unto knowledge, righteousness and holiness (Col. 3:10; Eph. 4:24). This is basic to Reformed theology.
The question included the relationship of this antithesis to "evangelicalism." My primary response to this part of the question is that the relationship will remain as ambiguous as the moniker itself. To the extent that evangelicalism imbibes the biblical truths of Reformed theology, to that extent will it affirm the antithesis, and structure its theology (including its apologetic approach) accordingly. To the extent that evangelicalism partakes of (some kind of) a less-than-Reformed theology, to that extent will it undermine, subvert, contravene or contradict the antithesis.
But any appropriation of Scripture's insistence on our covenantal status will inevitably need to reckon with the application of that status to the discipline of apologetics. Whatever the outcome of that "reckoning," it dare not water down our actual status, nor pretend that what is true "in principle" has no "real" application. Who we are as covenant creatures has much to say about what we know and do in God's world. Perhaps more on that at a later point.
The sight of Kutai would stop zoo visitors in their tracks.

On January 4th, 2014, the world lost an orangutan.
To be fair, the world loses a lot of orangutans these days. They're dying so quickly that experts expect at least one of the two species of orang to be extinct in the wild within the next 10 years. This specific orangutan, however, didn't live in the wild. They were born in captivity and spent their entire life in a zoo.
Kutai, a Sumatran orangutan, weighed nearly 200 pounds, stood as tall as a man, and had hair the color of the Australian outback. When Kutai walked up to the glass, their face as large and round as a dinner plate, you felt equal parts respect for the splendor of this creature and a sudden sensation of fear, like maybe humans weren't so tough after all.
During the 20 years of this orangutan's life, zoos have transformed from arks for species conservation to institutions centered on research, education, and animal welfare.
But what is a zoo, really? For some, it's nothing more than a prison for animals. For others, it's a safe place for a family outing. For people who watched the public butchering of a giraffe in Denmark, zoos might push into the macabre. But the truth is zoos are much more than anything you see in a typical visit. Kutai's experience reflects zoos' metamorphosis and their changing role in society.
Kutai was born in 1993 at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Kansas. Shortly before their 8th birthday, they were transferred to Oregon, where they joined their grandmother, Inji, a wild-caught orang from a bygone era when animals were routinely captured in the wild and taken to zoos. For their first nine years at the Oregon Zoo, they lived in an indoor-only habitat in the outdated primate house. Their dwelling had high ceilings and few windows; the walls were painted a medical green, and a wooden play structure stood relatively untouched in the middle of the room. Tony Vecchio, the zoo's former director, called the primate exhibit the worst they had to face during their time at the zoo. Orangutans have complex physical, cognitive, and emotional requirements, and they need something more innovative and engaging. And Kutai was an especially tricky creature. “Kutai was not an animal you wanted to play chess with,” says Vecchio, “he was always thinking three moves ahead.”
This type of exhibit fuelled anti-zoo rhetoric among animal-rights activists as well as feelings of discomfort for many zoo visitors who worried that the animals were bored, unhappy, or otherwise not well cared for. Such housing made the animals easy for visitors to view and the living spaces easy for keepers to clean. But as people have learned more about the needs of animals, more naturalistic habitats have become the standard. The transition has been gradual, but soon concrete cages will be a distant memory.
Kutai's keepers had to think of ways to engage the young orang and their companions, called environmental enrichment. As it turned out, the orangutans loved wearing clothes. Kutai and Inji would enthusiastically put on T-shirts and parade in front of squealing visitors. The orangs would react to boxes and hay, making nests near the window where they could comfortably watch zoo guests.
From 2000 until 2013, I worked at Kutai's zoo, first as an overeager high school volunteer searching for community service hours and later as an overeager educator searching for ways to share my newfound passion for wildlife. As a camp counselor, I would bring groups of children to the exhibit. Often, Kutai would be crouched near the glass, their fiery fur pressed against the window. My campers could just barely wait their turn before rushing to occupy the prime real estate right in front of Kutai. At first, it was hard to keep them quiet while they quickly copied Kutai's stance. But their boisterous excitement soon settled into a reverent hush.
In my first few years as a counselor, I would try to impart knowledge about orangs. Who knows what brachiation means? Have any of you ever heard of palm oil? But I soon learned that the greatest introduction I could give my students was not to teach them about the ways that orangs move, or even the details of threats these animals face in the wild, but to simply let them engage. They would pull up their nametags and press them to the glass. Almost involuntarily, one or two would reach out their hands. And once or twice, Kutai would reach their out in response.
This kind of experience is rare and precious. Most zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums are located in urban areas, places where access to wildlife is limited. And with exotic animals such as orangutans, the chance of an up-close encounter with a wild creature in its natural habitat is remote. While menageries were once built as playgrounds for the elite, modern zoos and aquariums give people the chance to see and connect with animals of all kinds from around the world. Even better, people see zoos and aquariums as being racially, socioeconomically, and politically neutral. Bleeding heart liberal? Come on in. Tea Party Republican? Zoos don't judge. Give them your rich, your poor, your eager masses—the animals await.
In 2008, Kutai and Inji's future changed dramatically. The zoo secured funding for Red Ape Reserve, a naturalistic habitat that would house orangutans with white-cheeked gibbons. In the wild, orangs and gibbons commonly share the same forest. Zoo employees were thrilled with the news. Primate habitats are notoriously difficult to engineer, given the complex physical and psychological requirements of the animals, and the zoo was poised to create something great. Ideas started flying: sway poles designed to look like bamboo, a tunnel dressed like a log where orangs could watch visitors enter the exhibit area.
Shortly before the animals were moved in, staff members were allowed to play in the new habitat. We climbed the giant ropes, explored the intricacies of the new area, and solidified our belief that this would indeed be an amazing new home for Inji and Kutai. The new habitat was lush with robust flora, a bubbling water feature, hills, and valleys. Perhaps the most stunning feature of the new habitat was a 40-foot-tall “enrichment tree” in its center. Inside the trunk was a spiral staircase and various openings where keepers could hide food for the orangs. Standing at the top of the enrichment tree, looking over the top of the zoo, I felt that things were improving.
Before I started working at the Oregon Zoo, I hadn't exactly been a zoo enthusiast, but I hadn't been a doubter either. I went to the zoo once a year with my family. It was fun—I saw the hippos, ate ice cream, posed for some photos. I vaguely considered that it might be great if all animals could live in wide open spaces, in harmony with humans.
But even as a child I knew this wasn't practical. In 8th grade, we went on a school field trip to the zoo where the assignment was to “redesign” an animal exhibit. This was the first time I ever remember thinking that here was the potential to provide better lives for animals and stronger connections between animals and people. The diorama of a bird exhibit that I built was a true work of art, but somehow the zoo didn't immediately reconstruct the eagle habitat per my recommendation. But new zoo habitats were being constructed based on a very similar vision of welfare and education.
Kutai and Inji's big day arrived in 2010. In front of excited staff, visitors, and media, the gibbons scampered, Inji explored. But perhaps the most stunning image of the day was Kutai, hanging from the mesh canopy, showing off their massive form like no one had seen before.
Life in the reserve was good. The animals were more active than ever. Kutai often climbed along the mesh, a sight that unfailingly stopped visitors in their tracks. When the crowd grew especially thick I would quicken my step to join them, because I knew that they were seeing something amazing. The new exhibit became a major educational tool. With eager teen volunteers serving as spokespeople, the zoo brought to light the environmental damage caused by palm oil farming and its severe consequences for animals like orangutans. In the past four years, orangutan populations dropped 14 percent due to habitat destruction from expanding plantations. Listening to these stories, visitors' eyes would shift from the teens to Inji, sitting patiently in a nest of straw. Them presence brings these statistics—vague figures from a far-away land—to life.
I wish I could say that I had seen Kutai just before they died or that I had a poignant story about watching them draw their last breath. But I don't. In reality, I was at a bar with two of my friends from the zoo. “Did you hear?” one of my friends asked carefully. “Kutai died yesterday.” I was shocked. I was saddened. I texted everyone I knew who might care and a few who probably didn't. In our conversations about them over the next few days, my friends and I agreed on one thing: we were glad that they had lived such a good life.
Now I work as a consultant, helping zoos evaluate the impact that their programs and exhibits have on the way visitors think, feel, and act toward wildlife. In my more glamorous moments—the ones I spend not in front of a computer—I get to visit zoos across the country, seeing what's new. On an icy day in December, I went to see the St. Louis Zoo's new sea lion exhibit, where splashing animals moved easily from land to water. During a weekend spent in a tent at the San Diego Zoo's Safari Park, I watched the zoo break ground on a massive tiger habitat. And on a quiet day in central California, I thrilled over the Fresno-Chaffee Zoo's blueprints for a new Africa exhibit that could double the size of the entire park.
The data I've collected indicate that zoos are moving our relationships with animals in a positive direction. To be sure, zoos are not perfect. There are still exhibits that are unsatisfying. Sometimes animals die and no one knows exactly why. But if you've ever gone to a zoo and had that uneasy feeling that you couldn't quite place, you're not alone. The people who work in zoos have that feeling too, and want nothing more than to improve the quality of every animal's life to the highest possible standard. But zoos cannot take the necessary steps alone. The power of zoos lies in their ability to reach a number and diversity of people unsurpassed by any other educational outlet short of public schooling. Without the support of the people, moving forward with better habitats, field conservation, and educational programs becomes near impossible.
On May 5th, the zoo's director and head veterinarian were fired. The city government, which runs the zoo, cited Kutai's death as the primary motivation. The dismissals demonstrate that the pursuit for a high quality of animal care can be complex and zoos are constantly questioning their practices in a quest to improve. While Kutai's death has sparked controversy, their life was replete with examples of the care and dedication that keepers, veterinarians, educators, scientists, and visitors give to animals at the zoo. But though Kutai was special, they were not unique. The next time you find yourself with an empty Sunday, scope out your local zoo or aquarium. Stay a little longer at a couple exhibits and watch, even after the crowd has dispersed. Find a keeper narrating a feeding session and chat with them afterward. Look at your visit with new eyes and ask, what are you zoo's stories? Who is your Kutai? And what can you do to help?

Short Review: (Review copy provided by Developer)
This was a game I wasn't too sure about going in but the opening really drew me in. I was about an hour in when things really started to take their toll as I was trying to figure out how to get by enemies and trying to get enough gold to purchase certain items. The opening really made me think twice about things since this was a game that depending on what you do in the beginning will effect the rest of the game. I didn't know that going into it so I thought well, I won't give them this item because I may need it. Rather not give away something that I will need soon, I quickly regretted those decisions as I had to pay for not giving them items real quick. This is a game I would recommend but it is on the short end so don't go into it thinking it will last several hours. I was able to beat the game within 3 hours but it does offer some replay-ability because of the different ways to getting to the end and the end itself.
Basic icon nothing special:
Story
You are Hans and it is your birthday! Which would be exciting but you are poor so when you return home you find that your mother has nothing for you and I believe your father is dead? It isn't really explained but it seems that way given what is happening. You are clearly upset and angry at your mother for not having anything for you. Hans storms off and says that they are going to run away to have their own adventure. They meet a few strange characters that will soon either be your ally or your enemy in the near future. Hans reaches Castle Tenebre, where The Count Lucanor lives but is very sick. A Kobold explains to you that if you are able to figure out their name you will be able to become the new count. There is a catch though you must venture into the castle to collect letters to be able to guess their name, if guessed correctly you win the honor of becoming the new count.
Gameplay
You will mainly solve puzzles while gain more letters to solve the answer of the Kobold's name. I found that walking…. is slow…. like real slow. I understand that they are a child but I've seen some fast children so when I get caught with an enemy is most cases I will always get hit once. It is really bad when a certain enemy will pull you in and you will be able to outrun it but then a goat comes out a nowhere and attacks you. It is a bit of an issue but you get enough healing items that it never becomes an issue. During the entire playthrough I only died twice and once was completely my fault because I really shouldn't have walked into the spikes which I could clearly see.
Personal Experience
It was a pretty neat experience and the puzzles are pretty easy but using candles was a great way to keep me on my toes. I always felt like I was needing more and then all of a sudden more appear after I check a few places. The ending is pretty great which I was surprised by since I really didn't expect much but a good job with end credits.
Final Thoughts
I would say wait for a sale. It is hard to recommend the game at $15. Even though I enjoyed it and think I've got my money's worth it is hard to say someone else will enjoy it. This game is also very unique so there is nothing else like it certainly on the Switch. I will be adding some gameplay footage in a few days since I have been trying to branch out my YouTube channel with more gameplay from all the games I have.
UPDATE: 5/30/18
I would give this game a 6 out of 10!

Pretty nice game to end start the week, a little late but it is finally here. I will be starting my let's play this weekend hopefully. I was finally able to play some Fire Emblem Warriors and I couldn't put it down. Pokken and Sine Mora EX are still sealed… really should get those started as well. If you haven't noticed my 100 hour reviews will be late. I am aiming for mid Nov with Super Mario Odyssey for Early Dec. I will have more free time again come Dec. but currently school and work are taking their toll and many reviews are suffering slightly but will be updated to date rather soon.

Yomawari: Night Alone Review – Run Kid! (Vita)
Yomawari: Night Alone is a survival horror game which has the rare honor of being a console exclusive on the PlayStation Vita (also seeing release on Windows). Released last October in Japan, the game evidently sold well enough to warrant a localization effort for North America and Europe by NIS America. We've put in our time in on the localized version, and have our review ready for you below.
Otherworldly Visuals
As evidenced in the screenshot above, Yomawari‘s visual design is pretty striking. There are some very abstract, weird, and even occasionally startling, spirits and things to find and run away from, like this gigantic cat head that doesn't seem too pleased to meet your acquaintance. There are other things, such as gaping mouths jutting out from the ground, but we won't divulge many others of the creepier spirits which roam the world, lest we spoil the surprise of being startled by them.
Yomawari‘s tensest moments occur when you narrowly escape a spirit, and hide behind a bush or notice sign. While you're hiding, you cannot be attacked by a spirit, but you also cannot see anything but the object you are hiding behind. As your heart beats, it sends out a wave of red, and spirits are represented by a red smoke-like sprite, which usually walks away and out of sight, giving you a few moments to leave your cover and explore some more.
Yomawari is played in an isometric perspective. You use the left stick to move, and the right stick to look around in front of you with your flashlight. Square can throw some objects, like rocks, but this usually doesn't do a whole lot. You can use L to tiptoe around, but that feels largely useless throughout most of the game. The R button sprints, and you have a stamina bar which, once emptied, slows you down. If you're being chased by a spirit, which is fairly often in Yomawari, your stamina inexplicably depletes much faster than usual. This is in direct contradiction of what occurs in real life. Think about it: in reality, when you are scared, adrenaline starts pumping, precisely so that your body can run (or fight) for a longer period of time, in an attempt to keep you alive.
Awkward Movement
Another issue that crops up from time to time is that the environment gets in the way at the worst time. Some of the edges of what appears to be walkable areas are blocked by an object which is difficult to distinguish on the Vita's smaller screen. Also, while you move with an analog stick, it feels like you're stuck moving in only eight directions. You can also only point your flashlight in front of you, which is a realistic take and forces you to face in the direction that you wish to shine your light on.
Without giving too much away, the entire game takes place in a seemingly abandoned town, and the story revolves around trying to find your dog and sister after they are taken in the night. Each time you complete a chapter of the story, time progresses one full night – for some reason you only ever play during the night time.
You're Too Young to Die
Yomawari has an interesting dichotomy going on; you play as a young girl, and as such, every game-related menu element is drawn in what appears to be crayoned. This is a nice aesthetic, though it also means that the town's map is woefully inadequate. This is likely a design choice, so that you don't really know what is in one particular area, keeping some sense of surprise if you either have never visited an area before, or haven't been back in a while. However, the story is also told from the girl's point of view, and as such you are often left to your own devices, and must figure out where to go or what to do next. This can result in some frustrating backtracking or missed objectives, but some horror game players, admittedly, likely love this kind of mechanic.
Yomawari: Night Alone may provide the occasional jump scare if you're playing with headphones on, but ultimately the game isn't terribly scary. Death is about as meaningless as I've ever seen in a game, since everything that you have discovered or picked up stays with you, and the Jizo statues/checkpoint system only serves to save you time. In most any other game, death serves as a way to try a section over again. Some games get flak for not giving you enough of a safety net; Yomawari's net catches you as soon as you fail, and you will fail quite a bit as you work out exactly what the game wants you to do.
Despite its flaws, Yomawari: Night Alone is an entertaining game that will be perfect to play while handing out candy to the neighborhood trick-or-treaters. The incredibly lenient death system will be seen as a boon by those who suffer through horror games and love only having to experience a particularly scary section the bare number of times that is necessary. The save system also encourages a pick-up-and-play mentality, which is a nice fit on the Vita. Pick up Yomawari: Night Alone if you want to see a horror game on the Vita, because it will likely be one of the last of its kind, since the system is on life support.

The Closet will hold its first ‘Wonderland' event at The Oxford Club (Picture: The Oxford Club)
A new club night has been branded ‘distasteful' for offering a ‘free dwarf' with every VIP table booking.
The Closet will hold its first ‘Wonderland' event at The Oxford Club on Central Street in Manchester on Thursday.
One of the available packages is The Ballers Booth, which, for £850, includes entry for 15, a bottle of champagne, four bottles of vodka and mixers and what it describes as a ‘free midget' who will ‘dance on demand'.
‘The RGA campaigns for a better society for people with dwarfism and is strongly opposed to events such as these which we believe are distasteful and discriminatory, and can encourage abuse towards our members,' said a Restricted Growth Association spokesperson.

‘We were surprised and saddened to learn that The Oxford Club seems to think abuse or toleration of abuse towards people with dwarfism is acceptable.

‘We'd urge them to reconsider their decision to host such events.'
The club has already sold out of £6.50 early bird tickets and is now selling advance tickets for the event, which cost £8.
Other packages available include The Cheapskates Booth (£350) and The Wannabes Booth (£550).

Labour will vote against triggering the process for leaving the European Union unless Theresa May agrees to the party's “Brexit bottom line”, Jeremy Corbyn has said.
The opposition will join forces with Tory Remain supporters and other parties to try to block Article 50 if the Prime Minister does not guarantee access to single market, the Labour leader told the Sunday Mirror.
Mr Corbyn suggested Mrs May, who has a slim Commons majority, would be forced into an early election if they fail to meet Labour demands, according to the newspaper.
But the PM issued a stern warning to MPs and peers who “regret the referendum result” that they “need to accept what the people decided” as they flew off to India for trade talks.
The Government is appealing a High Court ruling ordering the premier to seek MPs' approval to trigger Article 50 and has insisted the deadline to begin Brexit by the end of March will be met.
Mr Corbyn said the UK must have continued access to the single market and there must be no watering down of workers' rights before Labour will back the process.
 They are also demanding protections for consumers and the environment and a promise that the cost over lost investment is covered by the Government.
They told the Sunday Mirror: “The court has thrown a big spanner in the works by saying Parliament must be consulted. We accept the result of the referendum.
“We are not challenging the referendum. We are not calling for a second referendum. We're calling for market access for British industry to Europe.
“If the Government calls an election we're ready for it,” they added.
“We have the members, the organisation and the enthusiasm. We welcome the challenge.

“It would give us the chance to put before the British people an alternative economic strategy for this country.”
Mrs May is spending three days in India laying the groundwork for an “ambitious” trade deal when Britain leaves the EU.
Speaking ahead of the visit, they said: “While others seek to tie our negotiating hands, the Government will get on with the job of delivering the decision of the British people.
“It was MPs who overwhelmingly decided to put the decision in their hands. The result was clear. It was legitimate. MPs and peers who regret the referendum result need to accept what the people decided.
“And now we need to turn our minds to how we get the best outcome for our country. That means sticking to our plan and timetable, getting on with the work of developing our negotiating strategy and not putting all our cards on the table - that is not in our national interest and it won't help us get the best deal for Britain.”
It comes after a row over the way the backlash sparked by the controversial High Court ruling was dealt with by the Government.
Justice Secretary Liz Truss bowed to pressure from barristers to speak out in the face of intense criticism of the judges involved, but only went as far as saying the independence of the judiciary is the “foundation upon which our rule of law is built”.
The Bar Council had urged the Justice Secretary to speak out as a “matter of urgency”, saying: “A strong independent judiciary is essential to a functioning democracy and to upholding the rule of law.”
Ms Truss said: “The independence of the judiciary is the foundation upon which our rule of law is built and our judiciary is rightly respected the world over for its independence and impartiality.
“In relation to the case heard in the High Court, the Government has made it clear it will appeal to the Supreme Court. Legal process must be followed.”
But shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said the comments were “too little much too late” and condemned Ms Truss for “failing to adequately stand up to attacks on (the) judiciary”.
“Liz Truss has still failed to condemn these attacks on the British judiciary as being ‘Enemies of the People' and talk in the press of the sexuality of a judge,” Mr Burgon said.
“I'm afraid that it's far too little, far too late from Liz Truss.”
Swedish EV Manufacturer Signs $12 Billion EV Deal With Panda New Energy
December 29th, 2015 by Kyle Field
Swedish auto manufacturer National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS), maker of Saab automobiles, has signed a massive $12 billion strategic collaboration agreement with Panda New Energy Co., Ltd., that signs NEVS up to provide Panda New Energy with 150,000 9-3 sedan electric vehicles between now and 2020. Also included in the collaboration are 100,000 other EV products and services from other NEVS companies.
Those not in the know might question the validity of this new deal. However, Panda New Energy Co., Ltd., is a “new energy” vehicle leasing company that cooperates with many chauffeured car service platforms in China. Net — it purchases tons of clean cars and rents them out to limo, taxi, and other private vehicle services. So, the deal makes sense… as does the company's lack of visibility on the public radar, since it typically plays behind the scenes.
Both NEVS and Panda New Energy seem excited by the announcement and see it as a deal indicative of an industry-wide shift towards the electrification of fleets. Stefan Tilk, Vice Chairman of NEVS, says of the deal:
“This is a strategic collaboration for NEVS not only in terms of the numbers of vehicles, but it is also an important step to implement our vision and new business plan. In the long term, we want to provide our customers with both sustainable products and mobility services.”
Panda New Energy Chairman Ma Chao shared the startup's excitement about bringing these new vehicles into the fleet over the next few years:
”We are very pleased to form a cooperation with NEVS, a company with a rich innovation heritage and the right ability to fulfill our demands. Being in an emerging market for new energy vehicles, we are happy to find a partner who shares our commitment to the environment.”
While NEVS is a staple Swedish company, it is actually co-owned by National Modern Energy Holdings, Tianjin Binhai Hi-tech industrial Development Area (THT), and the Beijing State Research Information Technology Co., Ltd. (SRIT). File this away as another Chinese-funded venture to keep an eye on. Might I recommend a factory of some sort in Nevada with some offices in California?

Most people across the developed world still get most of their news via television – and traditional news brands, produced by journalists, still top the rankings for the most read news on the internet. But a growing number of people have stopped turning on the TV, buying a paper or even visiting a news website.
They are reading their news – filtered for them by more assiduous friends – on their Facebook feeds or having it provided for them by organisations or politicians that are paying Facebook for their attention. Researchers have already noted a growing division between “news junkies” who read widely (but usually only from sources they agree with) and a growing band of “news avoiders” who are opting out of news that seems aggressively polarised.
Two recent elections give some idea of what is happening to news. In the summer of 2015, Jeremy Corbyn stunned seasoned political commentators when they sailed into the leadership of the British Labour Party. Similarly, in the US election race, outsider Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls. Nearly 60% of Corbyn supporters use social media as their main source of news (the average is 32%). An analysis by US Uncut found that Sanders received 42% of Facebook mentions compared to 13% for Clinton.
For their supporters, social media platforms represent a radical new dawn in which conservative old media will give way to a myriad of new ideas. Among the politically aligned and interested, social media provides a mobilising force that builds passionate partisanship. But they don't realise that they are living in a bubble and barely registering in the minds of people who either don't share their viewpoint or (and this is more important) are not particularly interested in politics. Sanders garnered less than a third of the press attention that Clinton attracted. Those voters who don't share the social media profile of their supporters may never hear their arguments. Viral news needs the blood stream of broader media to carry it from one silo to another.

Growing ‘news gap'
Polarisation of news is commonplace in southern Europe, where it has always been politically aligned. But in northern Europe, television has, since its inception, been regulated (Daniel Hallin and Paolo Mancini 2004, Comparing Media Systems) in order to ensure that people encounter public information and that it is relatively politically neutral. The US shared this approach until 1987 when the “fairness doctrine” was repealed and the stage was set for the rise of polarised news.
Research by Norwegian academic Toril Aalberg and James Curran, a colleague of mine at Goldsmiths, found that deregulation had other effects: in the US, those with university degrees are far more likely to be knowledgeable about news events than those without university education – a problem that is not encountered in the Nordic countries where news is still regulated. The 2015 Reuters Digital News Report also found far greater political polarisation: two thirds of the Fox News audience identify as right wing, while only 6% identify as left wing. In the UK there is virtually no political polarisation across channels.

In those countries that retained their television regulation and more neutral forms of television news broadcasts, what has been termed the “news gap” between informed and uninformed publics has been held at bay – but that may last only as long as television remains the major source of news for the bulk of the population. As the youngest audiences, absorbed by their portable screens, turn away from TV news selected and ranked by editors, “me” journalism – provided according to its audiences' pre-determined requirements – is on the rise.
Rise of the “Daily Me”
In the summer of 2011, the UK Guardian was attracting 35% of its audience via searches from Google and only 2% from social media. Most of the rest came direct to its website. Then the Guardian signed up to the Facebook news app and six months later, The Monday Note blog announced: “This week's most stunning statistic: In February, Facebook drove more traffic to the Guardian website than Google did”.
The Guardian's traffic soared by more than 60% as readers signed up to the app and everything they read was automatically posted into their Facebook feed where it might be seen by their friends, commented on and passed on to others. Since the broad assumption was that numbers would drive ads and ads would increase digital revenue, the Guardian was delighted and many other publishers jumped in with Facebook to share this new source of distribution.
Three years later, only 6% of the news stories being read by app subscribers actually get shared and it is Facebook that determines what they will be – based on its own data of individual users' “likes”.
A study by US researcher Pablo J Bocskowski, Eugenia Mitchelstein and Martin Walter in 2010 found that most people click on stories about sports, entertainment, crime and weather. My own research suggests that most of what is shared follows this pattern and that shares are also gender biased. Young women tend to see news that evokes empathy (crime, health, social justice), while young men are more likely to talk about technology, gaming and sport. Those who are interested in politics share only what interests (or angers them) them and are unlikely to see the counterarguments.
This effect is exacerbated on Twitter where polarisation is rife. Analysis of the events in Ferguson US in 2015 and how they were discussed on social media, shows just how little Twitter has helped people to listen to the views of others.
Facebook now dominates the news being read by young people and its domination is not just national – it is global. It may well be time to think about what societies need to do to counter this growing, global news monopoly. Facebook may not be in the business of news production but its impact on news is already profound and not always positive.
A surge of debris washing up on the shores of B.C.'s Haida Gwaii and believed to be from the 2011 Japanese tsunami is prompting calls to launch possibly the biggest beach cleanup Canada has ever seen.
Countless pieces of Styrofoam now dot beaches on the north shores of Haida Gwaii, formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands, about 800 kilometres northwest of Vancouver.
"It's a lot now, and it's just the beginning," said Haida fisherman Bruce Stewart Burton. "I'm kind of afraid what we're going to see in the near future."
There's no proof much of the suddenly appearing and unmarked debris was washed away from Japan in the March 2011 tsunami, but among the flotsam there are also many bottles with Japanese writing.
The beaches are also in the same general area where a Harley-Davidson from Japan washed ashore in April. One part of the beach is so cluttered with new junk that it looks like a landfill, with rusty propane tanks, barrels and plastic gasoline cans, some with fuel still in them.
Massive debris en route
The concerns of locals are shared by Vancouver Aquarium CEO John Nightingale, who recently returned from Haida Gwaii, where they had surveyed a debris field from a boat off the coast.
"Never before had we been out there and just stand on the deck of the boat and see identifiable floating pieces of plastic as far as the eye can see," Nightingale said.
Nightingale said it's potentially disastrous for the ecosystem.
"We could see beaches physically changed, their ecology, how animals interact with them."
Haida administrators like John Disney are concerned that light debris that's been blown by the wind is only a hint of the mess ocean currents could bring in the coming months, perhaps as early as October.
"What we didn't realize ... until we started monitoring satellite imagery, is how big the debris field is that is coming. That's the heavy stuff that's affected by ocean currents, and that's just massive," Disney said.
Disney said it just won't be acceptable to leave it on B.C.'s beaches.
"We need to get it off there and come up with a plan. That's what we need here — a plan that kicks in at different stages."
North Hempstead officials have given the North Shore Animal League preliminary approval to build a cat-centric pet adoption center at its facility in Port Washington.
At the town board's February meeting, league officials presented the construction plans for Bianca's Furry Friends Center, or the BFF Center. League officials said they want to build a 14,380-square-foot second floor onto their facility at 25 Davis Ave..
Bob Kelterborn, the league's facilities manager, told board members that the second floor will be a unique housing and adoption arena.
“We will have a features center for where we'll show animals of the month and then we'll have a nursery,” Kelterborn said. “It'll be a cage-free environment . . . We found that cages are stressful to the animals.”
Town board members say the renderings for the addition looked stunning and they're excited to see the final product.
The league did not receive full approval because the staff has to submit paperwork proving that they would abide by six special construction requests from the town, said Councilwoman Dina DeGiorgio.
For example, the building material for the second floor construction can only be staged on the league's parking lot. If the league's construction workers damage any trees during their work, the league has to pay for replacements. Construction workers can only build from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Also, when construction requires a crane, crews cannot redirect traffic along nearby South Bayles, Davis and Willowdale avenues.
League officials assured the town council that they would adhere to those conditions.
The league's upcoming construction is at one building within its larger 3.8-acre lot. The league received town approval for a 2,750-square-foot expansion of its adoption center in 2014.
Kelterborn said league staff has always housed dogs and cats in that same building and on the same floor. They said the second floor addition would allow the staff to separate the animals.
Kelterborn said construction would take 12 months. During the work, league employees will be moved to a different facility to continue their animal care and pet adoption duties.
BRUTAL! Tucker Carlson Destroys WaPo Hack and Paper's Entire Credibility in One Short Interview (VIDEO)
Tucker Carlson just destroyed any remaining credibility the far left Washington Post had before 9 PM Eastern.
On Tuesday Tucker Carlson had on Erik Wemple the Washington Post media reporter and far left hack. It was the most devastating interview in recent memory.
It was sort of like this.
This was brutal.
Tucker Carlson opened the interview with this question:
Tucker Carlson: In the past couple of months I've seen a lot of stories including some from you accusing people of basically carrying water for the Russian government and the Russian government is in the news today so I thought I'd ask you something I've wondered for a long time which is the Washington Post for years, for many years, has literally carried paid propaganda from the Russian government, a section called ‘Russia behind the headlines.' It looks like news but it's designed to fool readers into thinking it's real. And it's pure propaganda paid for, distributed by the Russian government… Why have you never written about that? How can you attack others when your own paper takes money from the Russian government.
Sadly, Mr. Wemple could not provide an answer to Tucker's opening question.
It went downhill quickly from there and went on for ten minutes.
It was like a ten minute luge ride for Mr. Wemple.
Enjoy.

Dear @WashingtonPost Please send someone over to the @TuckerCarlson show to mop up your remaining credibility from the floor. — Jim Hoft (@gatewaypundit) February 15, 2017
Ron Paul's campaign pulled in less money from members of the military last month than President Obama's did, according to campaign finance numbers. Paul's anti-war stances still draw more military donations than Mitt Romney, but the decline is another indicator of their campaign's increasing status as more of a traveling libertarian speaking series than a traditional effort to win the presidency.
On the Open Secrets blog:
Overall, Paul retains the lead. Analysis of OpenSecrets.org data shows that so far in this election cycle, members of the military who donated more than $200 have given Paul's campaign about $333,134, versus $184,505 to Obama and just $45,738 to Romney.
But in March, Obama and Paul switched places. Members of the military sent $36,448 to Obama and just $17,733 to Paul. Even though Romney solidified their position as the presumptive Republican nominee, military donations to their campaign remained anemic -- only $8,630.
Paul campaign chairperson Jesse Benton downplayed the numbers in an email to BuzzFeed.
"That is a rather silly assertion," Benton wrote. "We out-raised Obama in 2012 almost 2-1 from the military and Romney about 8-1. Whoever is trying to push this to you need to look at all the numbers, because they show the opposite of what thay [sic] claim."
Paul is set to be the last non-Romney candidate left in the Republican race next week when Newt Gingrich drops out, and they have said that he'll likely stay in the race even when Romney reaches the required 1,144 candidates for the nomination.

Let me start by saying that I love my kids more than I ever thought I'd love anything. But that doesn't mean there aren't times when I daydream about what my life would be like if I never had them. If my days weren't spent reading Sandra Boynton books, attempting to teach animal sounds, telling my toddler not to get into the cupboard for the eightieth time, cutting grapes into tiny pieces, reminding my 5-year-old to go the bathroom, sweeping up Cheerios, wiping up milk, finding lost pacifiers, squeezing Polly Pockets into stupid rubber clothes, sneaking away for five minutes to text my best friend and check Facebook to see what's happening on the outside…
Yes, sometimes I wonder if I would have had kids if I had really known what having kids entailed.
So, here is a warning for anyone who is contemplating having kids. I'm here to tell you: Don't do it! Unless…
1. You believe the best way to spend a night is in short bursts of sleep interspersed with changing soiled bedsheets, soothing irrational fears, and locating pacifiers in the dark.
2. You can picture yourself saying things like, “Don't put Daddy's shoe in your mouth,” or “Please stop licking your sister!,” or “How did you get cheese in your eyebrow?”
3. You think it would be charming to have another human spit up directly in your mouth.
4. You'd enjoy eating all of your meals while attempting to balance a squirming creature on your lap.
5. You love to repeat yourself. I mean, you really enjoy having to ask someone to do something at least five times before they even act like they hear you.
6. You loathe the concept of personal space. Really, if someone could be touching you in some way at all times, that would be best.
7. You'd like to be asked to prepare a snack for someone approximately every 20 minutes.
8. You think it'd be delightful to have a Wiggles song stuck in your head for days. (Mahshed bah-nah-nah, mahshed bah-nah-nah!)
9. You've always wanted to spend several tear-filled hours teaching someone with no patience the intricate art of tying one's own shoelaces.
10. You firmly believe having someone spend four minutes painting a butterfly on a kid's cheek is worth $15. Wait, glitter is available for an extra $3? Yes, please!
11. You can refrain from swearing audibly when you stub your toe for the third time on a toy you told someone to put away an hour ago.
Our solar system might be hiding two more planets in the icy darkness beyond Pluto, according to a recent study conducted by a team of scientists in Spain and the UK. The scientists, whose work was published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters, came to the conclusion after studying the orbits of several “Extreme trans-Neptunian Objects (ETNOs),” which are cold, frigid bodies orbiting the sun in large, elliptical paths beyond Neptune.
After analyzing 13 of these objects, the researchers found that the orbits of these objects were different from those predicted by the accepted theory of how the solar system formed. According to the known theory, these objects should have an average distance of 150 Astronomical Units (1 AU is the distance from Earth to the sun, which is roughly 93 million miles), but the ETNOs were found to have widely-varying orbits, ranging from 150 AU to 525 AU, the researchers said, in a statement.
Based on these observations, the scientists speculated that there could be at least two undiscovered planets whose gravitational pull is affecting the orbits and the distribution of ETNOs.
“The exact number is uncertain, given that the data that we have is limited, but our calculations suggest that there are at least two planets, and probably more, within the confines of our solar system,” Carlos de la Fuente Marcos from the Complutense University of Madrid and the study's co-author, said in a statement. “If it is confirmed, our results may be truly revolutionary for astronomy."
However, the researchers added, even if there are undiscovered worlds beyond Pluto, detecting them using current instruments might be extremely difficult, if not downright impossible, because of their distance from Earth, according to media reports.
Not much. apt is a new command that supposed to merge several functions from apt-get and apt-cache into one command. It's still a little rough around the edges but here's the command listing from --help :
Basic commands: list - list packages based on package names search - search in package descriptions show - show package details update - update list of available packages install - install packages remove - remove packages upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages edit-sources - edit the source information file
The equivalent functions are designed to work in similar ways but it's not a proxy command (it's not calling the old ones - it's a new interface directly onto the Apt libraries) so there may be some edge-case changes.
There are also some obvious omissions ( download , policy , etc) that power-users will miss and there are a whole raft of undocumented commands ( purge still works but I can't find anything on it).
16.04 Update: A lot of the omissions have now been included but aren't yet documented, nor do they have Bash-completions. It's a shame it's taking this long to implement functionality that already exists in the codebase but oh well. My advice is that if you're used to an apt-{get,cache} command, try it on apt . It might work.
There's also a DIFFERENCES TO APT-GET(8) section in the man apt page that's interesting:
The apt command is meant to be pleasant for end users and does not need to be backward compatible like apt-get(8). Therefore some options are different: · The option DPkgPM::Progress-Fancy is enabled. · The option APT::Color is enabled. · A new list command is available similar to dpkg --list. · The option upgrade has --with-new-pkgs enabled by default.
And if you want Bash-completions, I've had an attempt as writing a completions file for it already. These are included with later Ubuntu installs.
The president won re-election promising to raise taxes on those earning more than $250,000. Now he's already capitulating.
There are three points that people should recognize about the fiscal cliff deal that appears to have been agreed by President Obama and the Republicans in Congress. The first is the simple and obvious point that we have gone over the cliff. There was no deal approved by Congress and signed by President Obama before the 1 January deadline.
This is important because the budget reporting on the “fiscal cliff” repeatedly asserted that the country and the economy faced dire consequences from not having a deal reached by this deadline. They repeatedly asserted that we risked a recession, grossly misrepresenting forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office, and others predicted the consequences of leaving higher tax rates and large spending cuts in place for the whole year.
There was also the prediction that the financial markets would melt down if there was no deal approved by the deadline. While the markets are not yet open, they actually rallied on the last day of 2012 on the news that the outlines of a deal had been agreed, even though the deadline would almost surely be missed.
In other words, the financial markets responded as many of us non-insiders predicted. As long as it was clear that a deal would be forthcoming, they didn't give a damn about the fiscal “cliff” deadline. Chalk this one up as yet another example of the experts – the people who report on the budget and the economy for the Washington Post and other major news outlets – not having a clue.
The second point has to do with the substance of the deal. For those who wanted to see key programs like social security and Medicare protected, this deal is pretty good news. The hare-brained idea of raising the age of Medicare eligibility to 67 seems to be off the table.
The plan to cut social security benefits by an average of 3% by changing the indexation formula for the cost of living adjustment is also, at least temporarily, off the table. The deal also continues the period of extended unemployment benefits, ensuring that 2 million unemployed workers will continue to receive checks.
On the revenue side, President Obama gave in to some extent, raising the threshold for applying the Clinton era tax rates to $450,000, compared to the $250,000 level they had touted during their campaign. This is a gift of roughly $6,000 to very rich households, since it means even the wealthiest people will have the lower tax rate applied to $200,000 of their income. Perhaps more importantly, it continues the special low tax rate for dividend income, with the richest of the rich paying a tax rate of just 20% on their dividend income.
The resulting loss of revenue from these concessions is roughly $200bn over ten years, or about 0.5% of projected spending during this period. By itself, this revenue loss would not be of much consequence; what matters much more is the dynamics that this deal sets in place.
This is the third point. President Obama insisted that they were going to stick to the $250,000 cut-off requiring that the top 2% of households, the big winners in the economy, go back to paying the Clinton era tax rates. They backed away from this commitment even in a context where they held most of the cards. We are now entering a new round of negotiations over extending the debt ceiling where the Republicans would appear to hold many of the cards.
While the consequences may not be as dire as the pundits claim, no one could think it would be a good idea to allow the debt ceiling to be reached and force the government into default. The Republicans intend to use this threat, however, to coerce further concessions from President Obama. The president insists that there will be no negotiations over the debt ceiling: no further concessions to protect the country's financial standing.
At this point, though, is there any reason for people to believe him?
This is a president who encouraged members of Congress to vote for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) in 2008 with a promise that they would put bankruptcy cramdown for mortgage debt (allowing restructuring of housing loans for people with distressed mortgages) at the top of their agenda once they took office. This is a president whose top aids boasted about “hippie punching” when they ditched the public option in the Affordable Care Act. This is a president who has explicitly put cuts to social security on the agenda, while keeping taxes on Wall Street speculation off the agenda.
And this is a president who decided to put deficit reduction, rather than job creation, at the center of the national agenda – even though they know the large deficits are entirely the result of the collapse of the economy. And, of course, they are the president who appointed former Senator Alan Simpson and Morgan Stanley director Erskine Bowles to head their deficit commission, enormously elevating the stature of these two foes of social security and Medicare.
Given their track record, there is little doubt that President Obama can be trusted to make further concessions, possibly involving social security and Medicare, in negotiations on the debt ceiling. Oh well, at least we can laugh at the experts being wrong about the fiscal cliff “Mayan apocalypse”.
Cohen has always been ambiguous about what their "Hallelujah," with its sexual scenery and its religious symbolism, truly "meant." "This world is full of conflicts and full of things that cannot be reconciled," Cohen has said. "But there are moments when we can ... reconcile and embrace the whole mess, and that's what I mean by 'Hallelujah.'"
According to producer John Lissauer, the dramatic, synth-heavy original recording of "Hallelujah" was "gonna be the breakthrough" on Various Positions. "'Hallelujah' just jumped out at you," Lissauer told Light. But when it reached Walter Yetnikoff, the president of CBS Records, Yetnikoff was puzzled: "He said, 'What is this? This isn't pop music. We're not releasing it. This is a disaster.'"
Thus, "Hallelujah" wasn't even heard in the United States until Various Positions was released by another label. And even then, it failed to make an impression on the radio or the charts, where 50-year-old Cohen was competing against the likes of Michael Jackson and Madonna.
Jeff Buckley, a hungry young singer-songwriter from California, first heard "Hallelujah" on a Leonard Cohen tribute album they discovered in a friend's home while cat-sitting in Brooklyn in 1992. They began performing the song regularly in New York's East Village clubs, and called it "a hallelujah to the orgasm ... an ode to life and love."
Buckley's close friend Glen Hansard—who went on to win an Oscar in 2007 for their song "Falling Slowly," from Once—had moved to New York with him, and described Buckley's rendition of "Hallelujah" as a loving critique of Cohen's somewhat stoic original: "He gave us the version we hoped Leonard would emote, and they aren't afraid to sing it with absolute reverence. Jeff sang it back to Leonard as a love song to what they achieved, and in doing so, Jeff made it their own."
Buckley's rendition made it onto their only full-length album, 1994's Grace. The song and the album went largely unnoticed until 1997—when both took on a new, haunting significance after Jeff Buckley drowned in the Wolf River in Tennessee.
For a 1995 Leonard Cohen tribute collection called Tower of Song, U2's lead singer Bono took advantage of the opportunity to record one of their favorite then-underappreciated Cohen compositions. The U2 frontman went a counterintuitive direction with it, enlisting the help of a Scottish remixer named Howie B. to produce a thumping trip-hop arrangement.
"While there might seem to be no singer as well equipped to handle the song's balance of the earthly and the spiritual," Light writes, "Bono's 'Hallelujah' is, unfortunately, just awful."
Bono, in recent years, has come to agree. When Light talked to them for the book, Bono's first words were, "I wasn't sure why I agreed to do this interview, but then I remembered that I needed to apologize to the world." They continued: "The lyric explains it best. There's the holy and the broken hallelujah, and mine was definitely the broken one. ... It was a snapshot, a Polaroid, of a place I was in, but you really shouldn't go putting these things out when they're done in such a private way. Intimacy was the currency of the occasion."
There's a scene in 2001's Shrek, just after Shrek and Princess Fiona have angrily parted ways, where the titular ogre pines for the princess just as she's joylessly preparing themselves for a wedding to a tiny prince they don't love. It's a poignant moment in an otherwise raucously funny film, and Shrek's musical directors had been testing out sad song after sad song before they stumbled across "Hallelujah" on the soundtrack to Basquiat.
This post has been updated since the New York Times first reported Wednesday that a lawyer for President Trump talked about the idea of pardoning two of Trump's former advisers, Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, with their lawyers last year. The Washington Post reports Trump's former lawyer raised the possibility of a pardon for Manafort.
Okay, Mr. President. We hear you're not happy that the special counsel's investigation seems to be inching closer to you, and you're exploring how to/whether you could pardon former aides, people close to you and maybe yourself. There's evidence you seriously considered pardoning people in your inner circle who are ensnared in the Russia probe. On Wednesday, the New York Times and Washington Post reported one of your then-lawyers broached the subject of pardoning two of your top aides last year.
Why you would want to pardon them makes sense. The independent investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III has indicted at least four of your campaign officials, three of whom were in your inner circle. It's likely that those who have pleaded guilty are cooperating with Mueller on what they know to avoid heavier criminal penalties.
I spoke with some legal and ethical scholars about your pardon power, and here's the best I can come up with: You could pardon whomever you wanted, including yourself, from any federal crimes and probably get away with it legally. But politically, you could be in a whole host of troubles and could even lose your job.
Let's run down how this might play out, in three plausible scenarios.
Scenario 1: Mueller charges your campaign aides or family with a federal crime
Well, they have already done this. Mueller has charged four of your former campaign advisers with crimes, and three — former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign aide Rick Gates and former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos — have pleaded guilty. Former campaign chair Paul Manafort is fighting their charges.
Mueller's investigation continues, specifically into your family's financial ties, your political campaign's connection to Russia and even whether you tried to obstruct justice. They want to sit down with you ASAP.
How a pardon would work: You can pardon Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos and whomever else gets charged. You have the power to pardon people for crimes and the power to commute sentences. Presidents have pardoned members of their administration before: President Gerald R. Ford pardoned former president Richard M. Nixon; and President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of former aide Scooter Libby.
But: There's a reason presidents usually issue pardons on their way out the door: It's politically unpopular to pardon almost anyone.
And it would probably be especially distasteful to the American public if you pardon your friends, said Jens David Ohlin, vice dean of Cornell Law School: “It seems utterly corrupt for a president to escape criminal responsibility by pardoning their inner circle.”
Given that Mueller is already investigating whether you obstructed the FBI's investigation into Russia, is that really such a good idea?

Another but: Pardoning someone doesn't get them out of testifying. Once someone is pardoned, logic suggests that they can't invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying, ethics expert Melanie Sloan said. “You only have the right to exercise the Fifth Amendment when there's a possibility you could incriminate yourself and be charged with a crime.” So if you pardon people and Mueller's investigation is ongoing, they could be compelled to testify against you.
Speaking of …
Scenario 2: Mueller charges you with a crime

We're not sure this is a possibility as long as you're in office. The long-held view in the Justice Department is that a sitting president can't be prosecuted. The only way around that is impeachment, over which Congress has full discretion. Mueller could challenge that, but it would be remarkably aggressive on their part and require their investigation to fight two court cases: 1) whether you can be prosecuted, and 2) the crimes with which you would have been charged.
How a pardon would work: You issue it and see what happens. There really is no case law about whether a president can pardon himself; it has never happened. And Ohlin thinks it would be difficult for anyone to sue you over it, because it's not clear who would have legal standing to argue that they were directly affected by this.
But: If pardoning your family could bomb your approval ratings, pardoning yourself could be political suicide. “It smacks of royal authority,” Ohlin said. “If a president can pardon himself, he's basically saying, ‘Well, I'm above the law,' and that sounds like the type of royal authority we rejected when we created America.”
Even considering pardoning yourself crosses a line ethically, Sloan says. If you went through with it, that might be the tripwire that would persuade moderate Republicans to join Democrats and start impeachment proceedings. Already a House Democrat has filed an article of impeachment against you, and Democrats have a real chance of taking back the House of Representatives this November.
And all you need to get impeached is a majority of Congress to agree that you've committed “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” They can define those terms however they wish.
If you go through with pardoning anyone related to the Russia investigation, especially yourself, both Ohlin and Sloan think impeachment is the greater danger to you than any legal consequences.
Scenario 3: Mueller's investigation leads to state or local charges for you or your inner circle

This is a possibility, given that Mueller is reportedly investigating your financial ties, and you and your family have a lot of those.
How a pardon would work: It wouldn't. The Constitution gives states the right to conduct their affairs without interference from the federal government. So your pardon pen is useless in this case.
– April 3, 2010
A few weeks back, we spoke with US Army Cold Regions Lab researchers, Dr. Sally Shoop and Barry Coutermarsh, about a new vehicle simulator that teaches vehicle control and accident avoidance. The simulator creates an environment that mirrors the challenges that servicemembers face behind the wheel and will hopefully pay off in added safety for vehicle operators.
Below, are three videos provided by the Army Cold Regions Lab that demonstrate the live testing of student drivers with and without the accident avoidance training on the simulator. The fourth video uses animation to demonstrate how extra weight can impact vehicle stability.
This video shows a live testing of a student trained in accident avoidance using the simulator. Driver #1 completed a successful test.
This video shows a live testing of a student not trained in accident avoidance using the simulator. Driver #5 completed an unsuccessful counter steer and throttle.
This video shows a live testing of a student not trained in accident avoidance using the simulator. Driver #10 completed an unsuccessful release of break to steer.
This animation compares a HMMWV and uparmored HMMWV in a double lane change maneuver showing how the extra weight of the armor and turret affect vehicle stability.
Kirill Serebrennikov is accused of embezzling £900,000, but supporters say they are victim of crackdown on dissent
Hundreds of people gathered in central Moscow to protest outside a courtroom as a prominent Russian theatre director was placed under house arrest before a fraud trial that their supporters say is politically motivated.
Kirill Serebrennikov's lawyer argued on Wednesday that their client should be released on bail, but the judge ruled there was a risk they would seek to influence other witnesses or destroy evidence.
“I am an honest man,” Serebrennikov, who denies the charges, told the court. “I have nothing apart from Russia and work in Russian culture.”
The arrest of the avant garde director on Tuesday, amid accusations they embezzled 68m roubles (£900,000), sent shockwaves through Russia's artistic community and has raised fears of a crackdown on cultural freedoms.

“I am upset, angry and depressed,” Irina Prokhorova, a prominent editor and publisher, told reporters after the judge's decision. “This is reminiscent of the sad examples from our past. It's an obvious message to creative people and intellectual society: this is what will happen to everyone who does not submit.”
There were chaotic scenes earlier on Wednesday at Moscow's Basmanny court as journalists and Serebrennikov supporters tried to gain access to the hearing. Shouts of “freedom” and “shame” by protesters outside the building floated into the courtroom, making much of the proceedings inaudible.
Police arrested several demonstrators, including Margarita Solomonitsa, who was holding a sign outside the courtroom that read: “Give us our director back.” They were led away by police officers as they were speaking to journalists. “I have great respect for Kirill Serebrennikov and am sure they are a very honest person,” Solomonitsa said before they were detained. “What is happening to them is outside the law.”
Arrest of Russian theatre director raises fears of clampdown on dissent Read more
Serebrennikov said they should be granted bail because they had cooperated fully with the police investigation, which has been under way for months. A total of 34 prominent Russian directors, artists and singers, including the director of Russia's Bolshoi theatre, pledged they would guarantee Serebrennikov's bail payment.
But the judge sided with the prosecutors, ruling Serebrennikov should stay under house arrest until 19 October. The director will only be able to attend rehearsals with the permission of investigators.
The charges in the case relate to a period between 2011 and 2014 when a theatre studio led by Serebrennikov received significant government funding. Investigators have alleged they were part of a criminal group that stole the money.
Serebrennikov dismissed the allegations on Wednesday. “We did a big and bright project for the country, for the motherland, that was famous all over the world and became a starting platform for many young artists,” they said.
Leading figures in Russia's cultural world have said the charges are politically motivated, fuelled by conservative anger at the Gogol Centre, Serebrennikov's progressive theatre in Moscow, which attracts a devoted liberal audience. Since its foundation, the Gogol Centre has tackled themes including the role of religion, high-level corruption and sexuality in a series of critically acclaimed productions.
The Russian culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, described Serebrennikov's situation on Wednesday as “sad” and “deeply regrettable”, according to the news agency Interfax.

The criminal investigation in which Serebrennikov has become entangled shows no sign of ending. Several former colleagues of the director have also been detained. Police said late on Tuesday they had issued an arrest warrant for Ekaterina Voronova, a producer who worked with Serebrennikov on a staging of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Voronova's current whereabouts is unknown.
Russian media reported on Wednesday that the shooting of Summer, a film directed by Serebrennikov about the Soviet rock star Viktor Tsoi, had been indefinitely suspended. It is not clear whether Small Tragedies, a Serebrennikov play due to premiere at the Gogol Centre next month, will go ahead.
Nikita Kukushkin, an actor at the Gogol Centre who attended the hearing, said the theatre would try to work as normal. “If Kirill Serebrennikov was here they would tell us to rehearse,” they said.

The lymphatic system is a biological system that produces and transports lymph fluid from tissues to the circulatory system and is a major part of the immune system. The major components of the lymphatic system are lymphatic vessels, lymph, lymph nodes, and some other lymphatic organs. The system is comprised of tissues and organs that produce, store, and carry white blood cells that fight infections and other diseases. Major components include the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels branch, like blood vessels, into all the tissues of the body. Lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a colorless liquid, throughout the body. Along lymph vessels are small bean-shaped glandular nodules called lymph nodes.[1]
Functions
The lymphatic system has three primary functions. First of all, it returns excess interstitial fluid to the blood. Of the fluid that leaves the capillary, about 90 percent is returned. The 10 percent that does not return becomes part of the interstitial fluid that surrounds the tissue cells. Small protein molecules may "leak" through the capillary wall and increase the osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid. This further inhibits the return of fluid into the capillaries, and fluid tends to accumulate in the tissue spaces. If this continues, blood volume and blood pressure decrease significantly and the volume of tissue fluid increases, which results in edema (swelling). Lymph capillaries pick up the excess interstitial fluid and proteins and return them to the venous blood. After the fluid enters the lymph capillaries, it is called lymph.[2]
The second function of the lymphatic system is the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system and the subsequent transport of these substances to the venous circulation. The mucosa that lines the small intestine is covered with fingerlike projections called villi. There are blood capillaries and special lymph capillaries, called lacteals, in the center of each villus. The blood capillaries absorb most nutrients, but the fats and fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed by the lacteals. The lymph in the lacteals has a milky appearance due to its high fat content and is called chyle.[2]
Immune System
Main Article: Immune System
The third and probably most well known function of the lymphatic system is defense against invading microorganisms and disease. The organs of your immune system are connected with one another and with other organs of the body by a network of lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs filter the lymph to remove microorganisms and other foreign particles. Lymphatic organs contain lymphocytes that destroy invading organisms. [2]
Lymphocytes can travel throughout the body using the blood vessels. The cells can also travel through a system of lymphatic vessels that closely parallels the body's veins and arteries. Cells and fluids are exchanged between blood and lymphatic vessels, enabling the lymphatic system to monitor the body for invading microbes. The lymphatic vessels carry lymph, a clear fluid that bathes the body's tissues.[3]
Small, bean-shaped lymph nodes sit along the lymphatic vessels, with clusters in the neck, armpits, abdomen, and groin. Each lymph node contains specialized compartments where immune cells congregate and encounter antigens.
Immune cells and foreign particles enter the lymph nodes via incoming lymphatic vessels or the lymph nodes' tiny blood vessels. All lymphocytes exit lymph nodes through outgoing lymphatic vessels. Once in the bloodstream, they are transported to tissues throughout the body. They patrol everywhere for foreign antigens, then gradually drift back into the lymphatic system to begin the cycle all over again.[4]
Organs
Lymphatic organs are:
Tonsil: clusters of lymphatic tissues just under the mucous membranes that line the nose, mouth, and pharynx.
Spleen: it is similar to a lymph node in shape and structure but it is much larger.
Thymus: a soft organ with two lobes that is located anterior to the ascending aorta and posterior to the sternum.
Peyer patch: lymphoid tissue on the visceral surface of the small intestine.
Tonsils
Main Article: Tonsils
The tonsils are immune system organs comprised of masses of lymph tissue located in the back of one's throat that play an uncertain role in the lymphatic system. Tonsillitis is a common childhood illness and can create recurrent health problems such as fever, sore throat, and ear aches. The tonsils are one of the few organs that a person safely may have removed and the removal of them poses no risk to one's medical health. Interestingly, within the first thirty minutes of the removal of the tonsils they are able to bounce higher than that of a rubber ball of similar size [5]. The medical world has yet to come to an agreement on the importance of tonsils, but has recently strayed away from the removal of them (tonsillectomy) and is now suggesting to patients with throat problems and discomfort to try to wait out the problem instead [6]. However, doctors are recommending tonsillectomies to those battling sleep apnea. The percentage of tonsillectomies performed due to an infection in the throat is currently only twenty percent, and the other eighty percent who receive tonsillectomies struggle with sleep problems. Tests are also beginning to show that a tonsillectomy may also help improve a child's behavior and focus in school. [7]
"Fewer tonsillectomies are performed today than in the past because it is now known that the tonsils remove many of the pathogens that enter the pharynx; therefore, they are a first line of defense against invasion of the body" Inquiry into Life 10th edition, Mader, McGraw Hill, copyright 2003 p293
Spleen
Main Article: Spleen
The spleen is an organ of the lymphatic system that is located in between the 9th and 12th thoracic ribs on the left side of the body.[8] It is composed of masses of lymphoid tissue and twisted veins and fibers, and plays an important role in the immune system, constantly storing blood platelets and white blood cells. In an average adult up to 30% of blood platelets are stored away by the spleen.[9] Your spleen also helps control the amount of blood in your body, and destroys old and damaged cells. Although once thought to have been a non-vital organ, the importance of this organ in immune defense is vital. However, due to many circumstances, the spleen may become enlarged and start to provide problems for the human body, but this is often solved by removal of the organ (splenectomy).

• Players can get up to 10 games for second offence • 'A missed opportunity,' says anti-racism campaigner
The Football Association has voted to introduce a minimum ban of five matches for any player found to have racially abused an opponent but the new tariff immediately came under fire from campaigners for being too lenient.
The review of the minimum sanction for all forms of discrimination was prompted by the incidents involving John Terry and Luis Suárez and a subsequent summit at Downing Street.
The FA chairperson, David Bernstein, said the five-match tariff was very much a "floor" and that serious incidents would attract much stiffer sentences, with anything up to a life ban possible for repeat offenders. There is also a sense that the FA has been blindsided by Uefa's proposal to mandate a 10-game minimum ban in its competitions, which will be voted on at its congress in London next week.
"As someone working across borders to promote anti-discrimination I think it's a shame it can't be the 10 games Uefa say they will implement in their own competitions and that they are recommending all national associations will adopt," said the FARE director Piara Powar.
"It is a missed opportunity and also a shame when the FA has already sanctioned a player, Luis Suárez, for more than five matches for racism. One of the biggest concerns is inconsistency and mixed messages."
They added: "It's progress to have a minimum sanction but sanctions for players appear to be made up on the hoof. Why is biting 10 games and racism five games?"
But Bernstein said that the FA's plans had been widely consulted on throughout the game and that it had taken a global lead on the issue. "Uefa have come in very late in the day with this 10-match minimum," said the FA chairperson, who will step down in July. "We're showing considerable will – we're very proud of what we've done. Let's see where Uefa get to."
The proposal, accepted at the FA's AGM at Wembley on Thursday, threatens to leave the governing body out of step with Uefa if it passes its plans for a 10-match minimum ban.
However, serious transgressions can attract "significantly higher" suspensions than the five-match entry level. A second offence by the same individual will attract a minimum 10-game ban.
The FA can also charge clubs if two of their players are sanctioned for discriminatory abuse in any 12-month period. Discriminatory offences can relate to ethnic origin, colour, race, religion, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation and disability. Bernstein, said that the FA would invest £4m in combating racism and discrimination over the next 12 months. After a Downing Street meeting last year, the FA drew up a 99-point plan. They said that two-thirds of the plan had already been delivered.
"Importantly, today's agreement encompasses all elements of discrimination, not just racial abuse, and the depth of consultation demonstrates how seriously we have taken this subject, to ensure the conclusion is the right one for English football."
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC had access to wives of IS fighters held outside Raqqa.
Some 2,000 Islamic State (IS) militants remain in the Syrian city of Raqqa amid an offensive to recapture the group's stronghold, a senior US official says.
Brett McGurk, special envoy for the coalition against IS, says US-backed forces have seized about 45% of Raqqa since the operation started in June.
They say the group is fighting for its own survival and that the militants are likely to die in the city.
IS seized Raqqa in 2014, proclaiming it the capital of a "caliphate".
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have been gradually advancing on the city since November, and launched an offensive to take it on 6 June.
It is unclear how many civilians are still in Raqqa, but the United Nations estimates this number to be between 20,000 and 50,000.
The loss of Raqqa would be another major setback for IS after the jihadist group was driven from its main Iraqi bastion of Mosul last month.
The militants have lost 78% of the territory they held in Iraq and 58% of what they had in Syria, Mr McGurk added.
"Today in Raqqa, Isis is fighting for every last block... and fighting for their own survival," they said, using another acronym for IS. "They most likely will die in Raqqa."
More than 300,000 people have lost their lives in six years of conflict in Syria, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad before escalating into a full-scale civil war. Eleven million people have been displaced by the fighting.
Indie moviegoers are in for a treat.

A new online streaming service called Flix Premiere has just launched in the United States, but unlike other video-on-demands services, this one will only release independent, “never before seen” movies.
“The truth is that you have the blockbusters in the theaters. Then you got movies that are great for TV but all these independents out there don't have a direct platform. So, a lot of movies get made and they don't recruit their investment and great movies don't get seen,” Martin Warner, founder and CEO of Flix Premiere, tells FOXBusiness.com.
The company estimates that 95% of films never find their audience or recover their investment due to the traditional distribution model.
“We're the distributor meets the cinema. We do the whole banana,” adds Warner. “What we are doing is transformational because we're not going to bombard you with a thousand movies. We are going to give you eight or nine and then we are going to immerse you into the story.”

Flix Premiere, a UK-based company, is about to enter a competitive pool of other streaming services in the U.S. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is currently the industry leader with subscribers growing at a steady pace. According to Wall Street analysts at Trefis.com, subscribers are expected to increase from 50 million in 2016 to nearly 62 million by 2022.
In May 2014, NetFlix increased its subscription charges from $7.99 to $9.99 per month. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) meanwhile doesn't provide video streaming as a stand-alone service but as part of its Prime Membership of $99 per year, which translates to around $8.25 per month. YouTube Red, another streaming service for original content, also charges $9.99 per month.
“We're not a subscription model like some of the competitors. We're a pay-per-view, or what I like to say: You visit the box office and you buy a ticket and watch a movie,” adds Warner.
Each movie will cost $4.99 and part of the revenue with go directly into the hands of filmmakers.
“Right from day one, they get to see the transactions and see the audience that they're generating,” they add.
The new digital cinema is currently available in the UK and U.S. but plans to expand to France, Germany, Canada, Spain and Australia in the next two quarters.
Warner estimates that they will have between 2 million and 2.7 million accounts of people buying regular movies.
“To put that into context, Netflix IPO at 600,000 accounts, so we think it's a significant business,” says Warner. “I think what we are now saying is that words ‘blockbuster' and ‘independent' are really industry terms – they're not consumer terms. We're putting them on the same platforms.”
The company says the new abundance of films will revolutionize the industry “as we know it today.”
The North Queensland Toyota Cowboys have appointed Greg Tonner as the club's new CEO.
“Chairman Laurence Lancini confirmed the former North Queensland local, who has extensive experience in sales and commercial roles nationally and internationally, would be a wonderful asset to the club.
“We conducted an extensive search to find the right person and considered some truly outstanding candidates. We believe Greg, with their professional background and family connection to North Queensland, is the right person for the job.”
“We are delighted they are coming aboard,” Mr Lancini said.
It will be a home-coming for Mr Tonner, who grew up and completed their school and university education in Townsville and whose family has lived in the region for three generations.
Mr Tonner, who currently resides in Sydney, said he's honoured to be joining the club.
“It's a privilege to work for the Cowboys. I'm incredibly enthusiastic about strengthening ties to this fantastic club right across the north, and helping the club get to the next level.”
Mr Tonner will take the reins mid-season after seeing out their current employment contract. In the interim, incumbent CEO Peter Jourdain will continue in the role.
For the past seven years Mr Tonner has been involved in the telecommunications and IT industry.
Traffic-clogging construction has been underway for almost six months on Loop Link, the Emanuel administration's experiment intended to speed CTA buses through downtown, yet the bus rapid transit service will be launched late this year with fewer features than originally promised, officials told the Tribune.
Even before the changes that threaten to reduce the benefits of the whole endeavor to ease congestion in the central Loop, the $32 million project was labeled "BRT Lite" by some transportation experts because its design lacked several elements that are key to helping buses replicate the service reliability of rail rapid transit. Those experts said making a strong first impression was vital to winning public backing for introducing bus rapid transit citywide.
When Loop Link service begins on a date before year's end still to be announced, buses traveling in dedicated bus-only lanes were supposed to make stops at eight passenger stations that are being built on Washington and Madison streets.
But only seven of the stations will be operational initially, officials now say. The opening of the station at Madison-Wabash, on the east end of the Madison BRT corridor, is being postponed until spring, according to the Chicago Department of Transportation, which is building Loop Link for the CTA.
The reason for the delay is that the Madison-Wabash station's platform is close to the construction zone where a Loop elevated "super station'' is being built at Washington-Wabash, CDOT said. The $75 million Washington-Wabash rail station, which will extend from Washington to south of Madison, is expected to open in late 2016, CDOT said. It will replace the Madison-Wabash and Randolph-Wabash "L" stations.
Loop Link construction, which has exacerbated already horrific traffic congestion downtown, is about 35 percent completed, CDOT said.
"We'd like to thank everyone for bearing with us during construction. It hasn't been easy,'' CDOT spokesperson Mike Claffey said Friday. "The good news is we have made steady progress since March, and we are on schedule for substantial completion of Loop Link by the end of the year.''
However, the definition of "substantial completion'' is being stretched even more, as the overall project faces deep skepticism among downtown drivers who will have an average of one fewer travel lane on four downtown streets and also less on-street parking.
In addition to the snag in opening the Madison-Wabash BRT station, there will be other delays and changes when the new express bus service debuts on six CTA bus routes carrying 30,000 riders daily along the roughly 2-mile BRT corridors on Washington, Madison, Clinton and Canal streets, CDOT and CTA officials told the Tribune.
The service, operated on red-colored bus-only lanes, is designed to more than double the 3 mph average speed of CTA buses traveling across the middle of downtown. The CTA has estimated the average time savings per passenger at 7.5 minutes for trips that are generally a mile or less through downtown.
The Loop Link launch was supposed to include a pilot project to test prepaid boarding, possibly using rail-style fare turnstiles, at the BRT station at Madison-Dearborn, CTA chief planning officer Carole Morey said before construction began.
But the prepayment system, which is a chief component of reducing the time buses stand at bus stops, is being delayed until an unspecified date next year, CTA spokesperson Tammy Chase said Friday.
"All eight BRT stations will be able to have prepaid boarding eventually,'' Chase said. When asked to explain the delay, Chase and Claffey declined to provide details. Earlier this year, Morey told your Getting Around reporter, "Obviously there are concerns about fare evasion that we need to work through.''
Another major change involves scrapping a plan that would make it easy for riders to board buses and keep the buses moving on schedule.
The Loop Link BRT stations were originally supposed to have level boarding between buses and station platforms — similar to rail station platforms. The purpose is to make it easy for riders using wheelchairs to roll onto buses without the bus driver having to take the time to extend and retract the wheelchair ramp on each bus and to eliminate the need for the kneeling-bus feature to help older or partially disabled riders climb on board.
But CDOT and CTA officials failed to take into account the different floor heights of all the different-style buses in the CTA fleet "as we got further into the design of the project,'' Chase said. As a result, the BRT station platforms will not be flush with some buses, they said.
They said a compromise alternative that was reached, which the CTA calls "near-level boarding,'' will still be an improvement over current boarding.
"For many passengers who have mobility issues but do not use a wheelchair, this design will be less of a step and therefore an improvement that should speed boarding overall,'' Chase said. They said the mechanical wheelchair ramps will still be an option at the eight BRT stations.
As the skeletons of the new bus stations are being erected, some CTA customers are questioning whether the enclosures will provide enough shelter from "windy city'' weather.
"How did anyone come up with this open design?" bus rider Herman Watkins of the South Shore neighborhood asked your Getting Around reporter in an email. They said the bones of the station roofs, which currently resemble huge garden hoes but will be enclosed in glass, are too high and don't seem to extend far enough over the curb.
"It won't keep the wind, rain or snow out,'' Watkins predicted.
The design of the steel-and-glass bus stations was altered from an earlier concept that was more weatherproof, CDOT officials acknowledged. Business owners complained that a more enclosed bus station design would create obstructions and block sightlines to stores, CDOT Commissioner Rebekah Scheinfeld has said.
Claffey asked for more patience before making any judgments. They said riders will see that the stations are "a big improvement over the JC Decaux bus shelters'' that the city installed at CTA bus stops.
A woman sewing pockets for military uniforms at the American Apparel plant in Roanoke, Ala. AP Small businesses are struggling to stay afloat because they have to compete with super cheap prison labor.
Federal Prison Industries (FPI), a corporation owned by the federal government, employs more than 13,000 inmates at wages from 23 cents to $1.15 an hour, making everything from military apparel to call center and help desk support to solar panels and selling the products to the Pentagon and other federal agencies.
FPI, also known as UNICOR, operates inside 83 federal prisons and made more than $900 million in revenue last year.
In March Tennier Industries, which also makes military clothing, fired more than 100 employees after losing out to FPI on a new $45 million contract from the Defense Department.
In May American Apparel put 175 people out of work when closed an Alabama plant for the same reason. Owner Kurt Wilson expressed their frustration that they pay workers $9 an hour with full benefits and yet "we're competing against a federal program that doesn't pay any of that," according to CNN.
American Power Source will shed about 260 jobs when they close plants in Alabama and Mississippi on Nov. 1 because of competition from FPI, the AP reports.
"There's a federal program tanking our industry," Kurt Courtney, director of government relations at the American Apparel and Footwear Association, told CNN. "The only way for workers to get jobs back is to go to prison. There's got to be a better way."
Last month Kentucky apparel factory Ashland Sales and Service, Co. had to reach out to state Sen. Mitch McConnell to prevent FPI from winning an Air Force contract they needed to keep their Olive Hill factory—the town's biggest largest employer—from being forced to shut down.
Founded in 1934, FPI's operations are patterned after a "mass-production, low-skilled labor economy of the 1930s," according to a report last year from the Congressional Research Service. Dianne Cardwell of the New York Times called the company "inefficient by design" because it employs as many inmates as possible, "which diminishes the advantage of its low wages."
Despite a Small Business Administration ruling in 2005 that FPI cannot win service contracts set aside for small businesses, FPI wins federal contracts over private companies as long as its bid is comparable in price, quantity and delivery.
That's because intricate laws, regulations and policies "requires federal agencies to buy inmate-made items even if they are more expensive than like items made by private companies," AP notes.
"This is a threat to not just established industries; it's a threat to emerging industries," Representative Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.), who has sponsored legislation to overhaul the industry, said. "We know that in the recovery, many new jobs are coming out of small businesses. It makes no sense to strangle them in the cradle."
Chris Reynolds, president of Campbellsville Apparel in Kentucky, told NYT that their employees "just cannot believe the fact that a prisoner who should be paying a debt to society is being promoted through the federal government to take a job from an American taxpaying citizen," they said.
At the start of their mind-reading act, Bob Garner asked a federal employee for the name of their dead dog. They asked someone else to recall a person close to them who had passed away. Then they shared some of the messages the deceased sent from the other side.
Garner also tied a black blindfold around their eyes and asked the audience to pull out four items from their purses and pockets.
Each time, the self-described mentalist and “motivational speaker with a ‘WOW' factor” was able to divine the truth. What they couldn't predict was the outrage their $3,200, expenses-paid poolside gig would cause in Washington after their bill showed up on the General Services Administration's $823,000 tab from a Las Vegas spending spree.
Garner, 51, has a shock of white hair, a fondness for business suits and pocket squares, and an intuition for what their magic act can bring to corporate America. He's built a successful business on the meeting and trade-show circuit, where they make employees feel they're valued in a bad economy.
“What is a thriver?” they asked a recent trade-show crowd. “A person who is passionate about what it is that they love to do! You are all thrivers. Magnificent, intelligent people with skills others just wish they had!”
Bob Garner is a self-described mentalist and “motivational speaker with a ‘WOW' factor.” (Motivative & Communicative Concepts)
But what works in the corporate world does not necessarily fly in the federal government, where taxpayers, not shareholders, have to foot the bill.
Garner's booking at the sumptuous M Resort Spa Casino off the Las Vegas Strip, where GSA flew them from California in October 2010, has become a head-scratching symbol of a major spending scandal.
“If KPMG or Accenture hired him, it would seem like just a wacky thing,” said Howard Ross, a Silver Spring-based management consultant who focuses on leadership. “When spending in government is a big issue, the optics change.”
‘It was pure entertainment'
The abuses by organizers of the four-day Western Regions conference for 300 workers are catalogued in a year-long investigation that GSA Inspector General Brian D. Miller released last week. Hours before the report was public, Administrator Martha N. Johnson resigned, two of their top deputies were fired and four regional managers were placed on administrative leave pending further action.
GSA, which manages federal buildings and buys government supplies, is now the subject of a Republican investigation into its spending. It didn't help its already-damaged image late last week when the office of House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) released an employee-produced video clip joking about the Las Vegas expenses.
The Washington Post obtained Garner's name from a source familiar with the investigation. Numerous calls to their home and business, Motivative & Communicative Concepts, in San Luis Obispo, Calif., were not returned.
Three current and former GSA employees who saw them perform on the pool deck of the M Hotel described two hours of amusement. Garner mixed humor, mind reading and cheesy magic tricks, drawing a big crowd on the conference's opening night.
“It was pure entertainment,” said one witness who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conference issue is so sensitive.
Garner offered no motivational message to take back to the office, these observers said. That was provided on the event's final night by a former NBA player who preached self-confidence and breaking down stereotypes at work.
Garner's clients include Dillard's, the department store chain; the Home Depot Foundation; Blue Cross/Blue Shield; IBM and dozens of other companies and trade associations, their Web site says. GSA is listed as the only government customer.
“There were people who were wowed by it,” Anthony Lichtl, a former employee in the San Francisco office, recalled of the show. They described “mostly telepathic kind of stuff.”
“I don't believe in that stuff to begin with, but it was entertaining,” Lichtl said. Some of their colleagues were uncomfortable. When they returned to work and told them about the show, they felt awkward.
“They were saying, ‘We're here working and you guys are hanging out with a mentalist?' ” recalled Lichtl, now a commercial real estate consultant. “People were a little taken aback.”
A step beyond motivation
Motivational speaking has been a fixture in the corporate world for years, born at Fortune 500 companies seeking ways to inspire employees and help the bottom line.
It has slowly become part of federal culture: GSA, for example, has hired the Fairfax-based Steven Gaffney Co. (“Communication Experts Who Get the ‘Unsaid' Said for Business and Personal Growth”) and another, Momentum Training, which does team building.
Garner's Web site takes things a step further. “Bob is a recognized expert on the intriguing and mysterious topics of ESP and psychic phenomenon.”
When the motivation message crosses into pure entertainment, things can get sticky.
“We never would have allowed a paid speaker just to come tickle the troops,” said Michael Siskind, a former GSA event planner who left in 2009. “It shouldn't be just for sheer entertainment. That's not why we should be traveling.”
Garner brought their magic last June to employees at Santander Consumer USA, a subprime auto financing company based in Dallas. The company offers conventional car loans but specializes in high-interest loans for those already in default. Business is booming, but some new employees were having trouble adjusting to the company culture.
“We told [Garner], our associates are on the phone eight hours a day with irate customers who have defaulted on their loans,” recalled Hortensia Perez, a human resources specialist.
Garner's appearances at five sites during employee appreciation week were a hit. “We had people in tears,” Perez said. Garner told employees not to let bad vibes from an angry phone call carry into the next one, for example.
The company invited them back to its holiday party.
In a testimonial on Garner's Web site, the company said their appearances had a “monumental impact” on business, with productivity numbers jumping by 10 to 12 percent.
Garner was also a hit at a Washington Bankers Association trade show in Seattle.
“The buzz among the convention was awesome,” executive vice president Liz Wilson recalled. “‘Wow! Did you talk to that guy?' people would say. They were awesome. They were very, very good at reading people's minds.”

Defying the Obama administration, a bipartisan veto-proof House majority voted to rein in NSA surveillance of Americans late Thursday.
The 293-123 vote on the amendment by libertarian-minded Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had majority support in both parties, although a number of leaders in both parties and chairpeople opposed it. Some 135 Republicans and 158 Democrats backed it.
The amendment would prohibit the National Security Agency and the CIA from placing surveillance backdoors on commercial tech products and prohibit warrantless collection of Americans' online data. Its future in the Senate is unclear, but it's a sign the House believes a recently passed House bill to roll back the NSA doesn't go far enough.
The vote came after a spirited, if brief, debate on the House floor.
"The American people can be kept safe and we can follow the Constitution," Massie said. They said the NSA should have a warrant to access Americans' information.
And they said the NSA should not spend money to put backdoors into their products.
When the government "causes these companies to intentionally make defects in their product, they make Americans less safe. They make Americans' data less safe. and they compromise the quality of American goods overseas. But ultimately this is about the Constitution. If you believe in the Constitution, if you believe that it's still valid, if you think we can honor the fourth amendment and that we can still keep people safe, I urge you to vote for this bill."
Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., ripped the amendment as something that would help terrorists and endanger national security and undo a carefully negotiated balance the on the earlier bill.
"Islamic radical terrorists are on the march in Iraq and the leader has publicly threatened to attack America," they said. "Syria has become a vortex of jihadists from across the globe and the director of national intelligence and the director of homeland security have warned of the growing threat jihadists pose to our homeland. ...This amendment would create a blind spot for the intelligence community tracking terrorists with direct connections to the U.S. homeland. ...Such an impediment would put American lives at risk of another terrorist attack."
The bill had very unusual bipartisan support.
On the Republican side, newly minted Majority Leader-elect Kevin McCarthy of California voted no as did sitting Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., but newly minted Majority Whip-elect Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers voted aye.
On the Democratic side, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California led the vast majority of their party who voted with Massie, but Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland voted no.
The amendment's backers cheered afterward.

Swiebodzin, a Polish town of 21,000 near the German border, will soon be home to a 33-metre effigy of Christ, which, along with a crown that adds a further two metres and its 16-metre mound will put all other statues dedicated to the son of God in its shade.
Due for completion in November, the monument should pip the world's current record holder, Bolivia's Cristo de la Concodia statue, by some nine metres, and look down on the world famous statue in Rio de Janeiro, which stands just 30 metres tall minus its plinth.
Although erected ostensibly to show gratitude to God, the town hopes having the massive statue will bring tourists into a community that has lain off the beaten track for most of its existence.
"If we had opened a racetrack or a golf course here, tourists would have come only for the season. But with a statue of Jesus the season will last the whole year," a local official told Wprost, a weekly news magazine.
The Dempster Highway is Canada's road to the top of the world. It crosses the Arctic Circle and winds through some of the most beautiful and remote wilderness scenery in North America. Starting outside Dawson City, Yukon, and stretching 740 km to Inuvik in the Northwest Territories, the Dempster is an all-weather gravel road with two ferry crossings. There are six campgrounds on the Northwest Territories portion of the Dempster and three visitor centres. The best time for reliable driving weather is June through September, when the days are long and warm.
The Dempster Highway threads through the mountains north of Dawson, Yukon, then crosses an alpine plain. There's fuel, a campground and hotel at Eagle Plains, about halfway to Inuvik. From Eagle Plains it is a short drive to the Arctic Circle! From this point north you are truly in the Land of the Midnight Sun for 57 days each summer. Fort McPherson, near the Peel River ferry crossing, has a long history of trade and settlement. Explore that story at the Nitainlaii Park Visitor Centre. Visitors are welcome at the Fort McPherson Canvas Shop, a maker of traditional canvas tents and other canvas goods. Tsiigehtchic, at the confluence of the Mackenzie and the Arctic Red Rivers, offers a magnificent panoramic view of the rivers. You can choose a side trip on the ferry to Tsiigehtchic, or stay on the Dempster route, headed for Inuvik. Stop en route to Inuvik at Gwich'in Territorial Park for a picnic, a paddle and some fishing on beautiful Campbell Lake. Inuvik has two campgrounds and a range of visitor services, including well-organized tour services. Plan on taking a flightseeing tour over the Mackenzie Delta, or to Tuktoyaktuk and Aklavik.
WASHINGTON -- With cracks starting to show in Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's plan to ignore any Supreme Court nominee by President Barack Obama, a conservative activist group is about to start spending money to shore up McConnell's will.
The group, the Judicial Crisis Network, says it is going to spend more than $1 million to run TV, radio and online ads, especially in swing states currently represented by Republicans who are most likely to face a backlash for obstructing the Supreme Court.
The ads parrot the GOP position that with 11 months to go in their final term, Obama shouldn't get to fill the vacancy on the high court that opened with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia over the weekend.
“We want to thank the U.S. Senators who say that the American people should decide who picks the next Supreme Court justice," said the group's chief counsel, Carrie Severino, in a statement announcing the campaign.
The ads aim to benefit Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), as well as McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).
All except for McConnell are facing re-election fights in swing states.
Democrats, for their part, are trying to ensure that voters are aware of the blockade against Obama and predict that Republicans will pay at the polls in November.
The fact that a conservative group is mobilizing to keep Republicans in line -- with what appears to be the largest ad buy in the fight so far -- suggests they are worried Democrats could be proven right, or at least that they could scare the GOP off its course.
Below is one of the ads aimed at supporting Grassley, who at first backed McConnell but then said they wanted to see a nominee before deciding if their committee would hold hearings on the person.
New Delhi's infamous Tihar Jail—home to more than 13,000 inmates—has opened a restaurant that serves comfort food crafted by criminals.

Tihar Food Court opened earlier this month in the sprawling Tihar complex, the largest prison in South Asia. Samosas and other snacks along with drinks like lassi and even a thali with a variety of vegetarian dishes are on the menu.
Kapil Tanwar decided to bring their son to one of Delhi's newest and most unusual restaurants to celebrate the completion of their college-application process.
“I promised my son that I'd treat them to some prison food to congratulate him,” said Mr. Tanwar, sipping on a glass of masala lassi.

The simple restaurant has seating for 45 and no iron bars, metal detectors or armed guards. It has indoor and outdoor seating, a tandoor oven and its cream walls are decorated with pieces of art painted by prisoners.
It has small staff of a constable manager and seven convicts—mostly convicted murderers--who have proven themselves through good behavior during long years in Tihar that they are not violent or a flight risk, said Sunil Gupta, a spokesperson at Tihar.
While the restaurant is still waiting for more government approvals to officially open, it started a soft launch on July 10 to test whether it will attract customers.
“We began service to see how people respond to the food as well as the concept,” said Vimlaa Mehra, the former director general of Tihar Prison.
Suresh Kumar, a 32-year-old inmate who has been in Tihar jail for 12 years on a life sentence for murder, now works at Tihar Food Court 11 hours a day, cooking, cleaning and serving.

“This is just the start so we're all doing everything,” they said.
The restaurant doesn't have a full kitchen so most of the food is from a prison canteen, which is also run by inmates.

Tihar Food Court is one of the many programs aimed at making prisoners ready for the world outside. It has yoga camps, reading classes, cricket matches and film festivals in the 400-acre campus. Earlier this year it had a course run by the Delhi Institute of Hotel Management to train the men as chefs and housekeepers. It even had a job recruitment fair for people about to graduate into the real world.
The eatery is connected to the prison store that sells prison-made goods such as cookies, pickles, potato chips, clothing and even furniture under the brand-name TJ's.
“These things keep us busy and ensure that we're distracted from the fact that we're living in jail,” said Balkrishna Grover, another convicted murderer and waiter at the restaurant.

2016 is pretty much done and dusted and it's been an good year for Virtualization is Life! There was a more modest 70% increase in site visits this year compared to 2015 and a 2600% increase in visits since I began blogging in 2012. In 2016 I managed to produce 124 posts (including this one) which was slightly up on the 110 I produced in 2015 and in doing so passed 300 total blogs since I started here. I was fairly consistent in getting out at least eight blogs per month with June being my most prolific month with sixteen blog posts published.
Looking back through the statistics generate via JetPack, I've listed the Top 10 Blog Posts from the last 12 months. This year the opinion pieces seemed to be of interest to my readers and there is still vCloud Director and NSX representation in the top ten with my Veeam articles doing well. Again it was interesting to see that two of the most generic (older posts) and certainly basic posts took out two of the top three spots. It shows that bloggers should not be afraid of blogging around simple topics as there is an audience that will appreciate the content and get value out of the post.
I was honoured to have this blog voted #44 in the TopvBlog2016 and even with all the controversy around the voting I still hold that as a significant outcome of which I am very proud and I'd like to thank the readers and supporters of this blog for voting for me! And thanks must also go to my site sponsors who are all listed on the right hand side of this page.
With me moving across to vendor land it's going to be interesting to see if I can keep up the variety of posts as I “narrow” down my core focus…however I fully intend to keep on pushing this blog by keeping it strong to it's roots of vCloud Director and core VMware technologies like NSX and vSAN. I have the Home lab and the drive to continue to produce content around the things I am passionate about…and that includes all things hosting and cloud now with a touch of availability 🙂
Stay tuned for an even bigger 2017!

Last night the Louisiana House approved a bill that retroactively kills a lawsuit by the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East against 97 oil and gas companies for the industry's pollution and damage to the state's wetlands.
As Sierra Club environmental justice organizer Darryl Malek-Wiley put it, "this ends our latest effort to restore Louisiana's democracy and take down the Exxon flag flying from our Capitol building."
Malek-Wiley and so many other Louisiana residents and activists are floored by this political move - and they're tired of Big Oil running the state's politics.
Also outraged? GreenARMY founder and leader Lt. General Russel Honoré. Watch this great clip from Rachel Maddow to get the low-down and see Honoré tell it like it is about Louisiane state politics.
The fight is far from over, though. If you want to help, join the GreenARMY and Sierra Club Louisiana!
A Saskatchewan judge handed down three-year prison sentences Friday for Curtis Vey and Angela Nicholson, lovers who were convicted of plotting to murder their spouses.
Vey, 52, and Nicholson, 51, are both banned from owning firearms. The judge also ordered them to submit DNA samples and pay a $400 victim surcharge.
"Why good people do bad things is a mystery to us all," said Justice Martel Popescul in Court of Queen's Bench in Prince Albert.
In June, a jury deliberated for close to 30 hours before convicting Vey and Nicholson of two counts of conspiracy to commit murder — one charge for their own spouse and a separate count for each other's spouse.
Outside the courtroom Friday, Crown prosecutor Lori O'Connor said they sought a six-year sentence after reviewing cases from B.C. and Ontario with similar facts, adding those cases came with sentences between 3½ years to seven years.
"Part of the reason for the sentencing as high as they are in cases like this for general denunciation and deterrence is to put out there that despite how unhappy your marriage is it's not OK to plan to kill your spouse," O'Connor said.
"The sentence imposed is within the range and something my office will have to discuss whether or not we appeal."
Vey's lawyer, Aaron Fox, told reporters after the sentencing hearing that their camp recognizes the seriousness of the offence, however, they still hold the belief that the couple would not have gone through with their plot.
"I think it's fair to say this is pretty amateur hour compared to the other conspiracy offences we see like this," Fox said.
Nicholson's lawyer, Ron Piche, said it's a sad day for their client, who was disappointed with the jury's verdict in June and now again with the sentence. Piche added that an appeal will be considered.
"We've had the opportunity to look at it since the jury came back, of course we respect the jury system, we respect the jury finding, but I'm not naive enough to think the jury always gets things right," Piche said.
O'Connor convinced jurors that the pair planned to kill Vey's wife, Brigitte, in a house fire, and Nicholson's husband, Jim Taylor, by drugging them and then making them disappear.
Curtis and Brigitte Vey are the parents of NHL player Linden Vey, who currently plays for the Calgary Flames.
In their victim impact statement, Brigitte read a letter in court explaining how their family has been traumatized.
"The horror I experienced listening to that tape," Brigitte said. "You forced your children to go against their father and protect their mother."
Sentencing arguments
Lawyers for Vey and Nicholson argued that the pair were just talking, and had no intention to follow through with the plan.
O'Connor said this is a difficult case to sentence because there are no similar cases in Saskatchewan to reference. They spoke about the issue of domestic violence in the province before asking the judge for a six-year sentence for both Vey and Nicholson.
Fox told the court elements of conspiracy were established during the trial, however, the Crown never established the conspiracy could ever take place.
At the centre of this trial was an iPod recording captured by Vey's wife, where their husband and Nicholson are heard plotting a plan to murder each other's spouses. Vey's wife had become suspicious their husband was having an affair.
Court also heard a conversation Nicholson had with an undercover police officer who was in a cell with them after they were arrested July 6, 2013. Nicholson said they researched how to set a grease fire, but was too "chicken" to do it.
Fox told the court the case rested solely on the recording and the co-conspirators had no intention of following through with the plan. They recommended a 16-month sentence for Vey.
Piche argued there were no aggravating factors and no sophistication to the plan and it was nothing more than just talk. Piche suggested that Nicholson be sentenced to six months in jail, followed by with two years of probation and counselling.
Witnesses describe McCarthy's fatal fall
Updated
Sorry, this video has expired Video: Port Adelaide official Peter Rohde and police officer Stuart Bailey speak to the media (ABC News)
Witnesses say AFL player John McCarthy died after jumping onto a palm tree from the roof of a four-storey building in Las Vegas.
The Port Adelaide midfielder died early Sunday morning (local time) when they plunged more than nine metres from the roof of a complex at the The Flamingo Hotel.
They had been in the United States on an end-of-season trip with 10 team-mates, who arrived back in Australia this morning.
ABC correspondent Michael Brissenden says Port Adelaide football operations manager Peter Rohde has met with the coroner, who confirmed McCarthy appeared to die in a tragic accident.
"Apparently John McCarthy left a local nightclub about 4:30 [am] and walked to the Flamingo casino," Brissenden told ABC News 24 today.
"He ended up on the roof of a four-storey building and they jumped onto a palm tree, thinking that was an easy and quick way down.
"There are three witnesses to this. An elderly couple from California and a local person saw this happen."
McCarthy ended up on the driveway below.
Rohde says the coroner's office has told them they believe all the signs are that McCarthy died as the result of a tragic misjudgment after a long night of drinking.
Witnesses say the player had been drinking and was disorientated at the time.
Phone call home
Port Adelaide club chief executive Keith Thomas later revealed to reporters back in Australia that McCarthy became separated from their partying teammates.
They said McCarthy's girlfriend, who was at home in Australia, had tried to reunite the group after McCarthy phoned them
"She was concerned enough, because they were on their own, to make contact with one of our other players to try to get them back into the group," Thomas told a news conference.
"That player made contact with John, who suggested they were on their way back to the hotel.
"At that point the group felt they were OK and he's coming back. Now we would suggest the accident happened soon thereafter."
Thomas said there is vision of McCarthy entering the Flamingo casino which gives an indication of their state.
"I haven't seen it but it shows them no more than looking a little drunk," Thomas explained.
The investigation into the young footballer's death is continuing but their body is expected to be returned to Australia in the next couple of days after a clearance has been obtained from the coroner's office.
The club has been told it could be up to eight weeks before the results of toxicology reports are revealed.
Rohde is expected to return to Australia in the next day.
Counselling for team-mates
Thomas said McCarthy's returning team-mates are suffering and that group as well as their team-mates who were not on the trip are undergoing counselling.
"There is a bit of work to be done to restore their minds to where they should be," Thomas said.
"They are reflecting on `is there more we could have done?'"
Four grief counsellors are working with the players and Thomas said they will be with them day and night as needed, as well as being supported by their families and playing group.

If you think scorpions are scary, just take a look at this guy.
Named Schinderhannes bartelsi, it was found in fossilized form in a German quarry, and dates to 390 million years ago.
That's about 100 million years after the extinction of the last known animal to sport what's technically known as a "great appendage" — a giant claw growing out of its head.
But there it is, right between S. bartelsi's eyes: a great appendage.
If great appendage-bearing creatures survived 100 million years longer than we realized, then maybe they didn't die out.
Maybe they evolved — and come to think of it, scorpion claws look an awful lot like great appendages.
But if scorpions are a sign of ancient times, then S. bartelsi's discovery, announced Thursday in Science, contains an unfortunate sign of our own times: with business slumping, the quarry in which it was found has closed.

OLD BRIDGE -- A dolphin that strayed into the South River died Saturday after rescue teams tried to save the animal, a marine rescue group said.
The dolphin was spotted in the river Wednesday and teams with the Brigantine-based Marine Mammal Stranding Center initially tried using a boat to coax the animal to swim toward the Raritan Bay.
In a statement, the center said the dolphin appeared to be swimming to the bay Saturday morning and volunteers followed from a distance.
A volunteer spotted the dolphin swim into a shallow area and immediately alerted center staff, according to the group. When a team arrived, the animal was having seizures and struggling to breath.
"Despite their efforts to float the animal, it had no energy left to swim, and so they carried it back to our dolphin transport truck, where it died," the group said.
The dolphin was older and weighed about 400 pounds, but was "terribly emaciated," the statement said. State veterinary pathologists would conduct a necropsy.
For days, crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of the dolphin near the Old Bridge-East Brunswick border.
"Thank you to all who have followed and supported our efforts," the Marine Mammal Stranding Center said. "We wish it could have been a happier ending, but hope that people are now more aware of the diversity and fragility of marine life in our state."

Sixth day of demonstrations across France against draft labour reform law leave seven police officers and 17 protesters injured
Demonstrations around France against a draft labour reform law have turned violent, with at least seven police officers injured and 17 people arrested in Paris and Rennes, which saw the worst clashes.
Following changes to soften the bill, the broad-based protest movement has waned from its 31 March peak, when turnout estimates ranged between 390,000 and 1.2 million, suggesting the president, François Hollande, would be able to ride out the storm.
But 120,000 people took part in Saturday's sixth day of protests around the country, according to the interior ministry.
Police clashed with groups of masked militants hurling projectiles in Paris as well as in Rennes and Nantes. Paris police chief Michel Cadot said their officers encountered 300-400 extremists at the head of the union-organised protest in the capital.
The draft labour law seeks to introduce more working time flexibility and rein in labour tribunal challenges and payouts.
After some watering down in a parliamentary committee, the prime minister, Manuel Valls, is expected to propose limited further adjustments on Monday following a meeting with student leaders at their Matignon office.
The public protests have posed an additional headache for Hollande, whose popularity ratings were already the lowest of any serving president in modern French history.
Dissent amid their governing Socialist party last week forced Hollande to scrap plans to strip French citizenship from those convicted on terrorism charges, a climb from their tough stance in the wake of November's attacks.
In a further challenge to their reelection chances for 2017, the party's national council announced on Saturday that it would back a primary contest to select a single presidential candidate for the broader French left – a prospect that is likely to embolden potential Socialist challengers.
The capital also saw the 10th outing for nocturnal protesters from the nuit debout movement. It began on the margins of the 31 March demonstrations and has since gathered every evening on Place de la République, spawning its own online radio station and field kitchens.
First impression? WOW.
Unexpect is a frankly unexpected force in the world of music. This band is incredibly creative and hyper-talented to boot. Needless to say, I'm happy for stumbling across their music quite randomly on Bandcamp.
Their sound touches on avant-garde territory as they change furiously through an eclectic offering of stylings. The band even describes themselves as "a metal laboratory mixing elements of black/death/symphonic/melodic metal; progressive, classical, electro, folk, jazz, operatic, mathcore, ambient, noise, circus music and anything else crossing their minds." That pretty much hits the nail right on the head. You truly have no idea what to expect next when listening to this band. But you can expect it to be awesome.
I highly recommend you listen to their latest album "Fables of the Sleepless Empire". If you open your mind to a strange and new experience, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy the madnesss!

Two more partners have joined Microsoft in developing a $500 million smart city 30 miles northwest of Washington, DC – the first of its kind in the area.
The Washington Business Journal reports that the Gramercy District smart city project in Ashburn, Virginia has attracted two additional partners.
Private equity firm 22 Capital Partners, lead proponent of the Ashburn smart city initiative, announced it added the Center for Innovative Technology and George Washington University to the project. This follows news in March of co-investments in the project by technology leviathan Microsoft and Crescent Ridge Capital Partners.
As part of the initiative, a new umbrella entity for the project, 22 CityLink, is developing a “Smart City In-A-Box” platform. The replicable smart city platform aims to link “together all aspects of real estate development with a preconfigured, intelligent framework.”
The first test project of the platform will be the 16-acre Gramercy District in Ashburn that will underpin the smart cities that 22 Capital develops in the future.
Gramercy District in DC will be well connected
Gramercy District will have transit and commuter links to D.C., 900 residential units, a hotel, an office building, retail space, parking garages and a high-tech business center. The smart city will boost connectivity to the areas along the corridor between Washington D.C. and Washington Dulles International Airport.
“We believe that modern technology is going to be a major force in urbanization projects and can improve the overall quality of life for the citizen,” said 22 Capital Partners' Minh Le. “Our project is particularly ideal for this partnership because we are able to take a holistic approach to help foster breakthroughs in technology that will bring practical and economic solutions.”
George Washington University and its Virginia Science & Technology Campus in Ashburn will contribute its expertise in cybersecurity, data analytics and entrepreneurial development. The university is also a member of national smart cities initiative MetroLab Network that fosters cooperation between research institutes and municipalities.
Meanwhile the Center for Innovative Technology brings to the partnership its leadership in entrepreneurial ecosystems and early stage investment programs.
“Through this partnership we will look to harness this team's diverse technology expertise and higher education program deployment with this project,” added Le. “Our goal is to build a strong public-private-academia partnership to drive innovation and higher education.”
The Gramercy District smart city news comes amid reports that predict that annual revenues from smart city projects will grow to nearly $89 billion by 2025. Despite this spending growth concerns are mounting that many smart city initiatives are focusing on solving peripheral issues, with few big projects tackling core city problems.
Chaffetz: FBI Gave Immunity to Clinton Aide Cheryl Mills
"No wonder they couldn't prosecute a case. They were handing out immunity deals like candy."
The Associated Press reports: A member of congress says Hillary Clinton's former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, and two other staff members were granted immunity deals in exchange for their cooperation in the now-closed FBI investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state.
Rep. Jason Chaffetz (CHAY'-fits), chairperson of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, tells the Associated Press that Mills gave federal investigators access to their laptop on the condition that findings couldn't be used against them Chaffetz says, "No wonder they couldn't prosecute a case.

This fully electric vehicle might look dinky (hell, even its burnouts are cute), but it's just become one of the fastest-accelerating cars on the planet, beating the likes of the Bugatti Veyron and Porsche 918 to cinch a new world record for EVs. Built by a team of students from the University of Stuttgart, the car managed to hit 62 mph (100 kmph) in an astonishing 1.779 seconds. In fairness though, we should point out that this beats the previous record holder — Swiss team AMZ Racing — by just 0.006 seconds. According to a report from Electric Autosport, the car weighs 160kg and is powered by four electric motors and a 6.62kWh battery to generate 134 horsepower. This gives it a power-to-weight ratio of 1.6 kg/kW. Not as good as a Formula One car (1.0 kg/kW), but easily beating a Bugatti Veyron Supersport (2.08 kg/kW). Not so dinky anymore.

INVESTOR INSIGHT:
Sarah Ketterer
insurance companies last summer, we focused primarily on positions we already held and stress-tested them for the worst – barring the implosion of the euro zone – including significant haircuts on Greek, Portuguese, Irish, Italian and Spanish debt. Not everything made the cut – we got out of Italy's Unicredit because we found the downside incalcu- lable – but when we concluded the remaining companies had the potential to survive in any type of apocalyptic sce- nario, as value investors we had to step up and buy more. That meant adding to positions in banks such as BNP Paribas [BNP:FP] and insurers such as AXA [CS:FP], Munich Re [MUV2:GR] and Zurich Financial Services [ZURN:VX]. We didn't bet the ranch on them, but we weren't afraid of them either. As a point of reference, many of our competitors at the time were buying consumer staples' companies. We're classic value investors in the sense that when share prices are low, we think risk is low as well. Most people can understand that in theory but don't believe it in practice and even act as if it' s heresy . It's actually when prices are rising and stocks are converging with our share- price targets that we find risk far more uncomfortable.
Describe your research process in pursu- ing ideas. HH:
Our quantitative team runs a variety of value screens every week to identify companies that are cheap within their country or within their industry. That output is made available to the research team on Monday morning, which then goes about trying to validate if the stocks are really cheap or not. We always assign two people to look into each security and the goal of their fundamental research is to build a finan- cial model that reflects the underlying revenue streams of the business, the underlying costs of generating those rev- enues, the underlying costs of sustaining those revenues through investments, and any demands on cash flow from financ- ing, taxes and capital allocation. From that model we build a valuation frame- work – discounted cash flow, price to book, normalized P/E, etc. – for the busi- ness that is independent of its geography and specific to the industry in which it operates. That allows us to establish a two-year price target for approximately 160 com- panies on which we'll have done detailed research at any given time. We use two- year targets because we think beyond that you're getting further into the realm of speculation and have to start embedding assumptions that are much harder to jus- tify. We risk-adjust the expected returns to our price targets, and use those risk- adjusted returns as the road map to build portfolios that typically hold 50 or so securities in our global strategy and 60-70 in our international strategy .
How do you risk-adjust the expected returns? HH:
We have an internal risk model, which incorporates more than 80 factors that contribute to the return profile of a security over time, such as its industry, its country of domicile, its currency, the cyclicality of earnings, its valuation and the price momentum exhibited by the security over time. The model allows us to calibrate the expected volatility of any security as a member of the current port- folio, which is how we adjust the return expectation to our two-year price target. Our objective is to have a level of portfo- lio volatility at or below the benchmark, with return expectations that beat the benchmark. All else being equal, in a 50-stock global portfolio we'll be allocating more capital to the stocks at the top of the risk- adjusted-return ranking and less to those further down the list. That's usually sub- ject to a maximum holding in any one security at the time of purchase of 5%.
SK:
One advantage of having this type of roadmap is that it constantly adjusts the risk-adjusted returns as share prices move. As the price goes up, the return expectation decreases and we adjust position sizes on a regular basis to reflect that. So while the stock of Molina Healthcare [MOH], which is a managed- care provider focused on Medicaid patients, was extremely attractive to us on a risk-adjusted basis last fall, as its price has more than doubled we've taken profits and cut the position back dramat- ically. If the stock continues to outper- form, it will continue to move down the ranking – a signal for us to sell – until finally the stock has a zero weight in the portfolio.
Y ou've historically steered relatively c lear of Japan. Why? HH:
W e have been underweight Japanese equities since we started, which reflects our view that Japanese managers by and large have been horrible allocators of cap- ital. CEOs seem to have a time frame that far exceeds even ours, or believe their employees are more prominent con- stituents than shareholders. While this type of mentality has changed consider- ably in Europe, it's still a big problem for us in investing in Japan. We will find companies we like there, but they tend to be far more internation- al than domestic. One position of ours today is in JGC Corp. [1963:JP], a lead- ing specialist engineering company focused on oil refineries and liquid-natu- ral-gas [LNG] plants, with nearly 80% of its revenues generated outside of Japan. It has an excellent balance sheet, benefits from growing worldwide demand for LNG, and has a competitive cost base off which to bid on large-scale projects. While management isn't entire- ly Western in its approach, we're quite comfortable with its flight attendantship of shareholder capital.

Tom Wheeler (Alex Wong/Getty Images)
The nation's top telecommunications regulator said Thursday that they will step down at the end of President Obama's term, paving the way for President-elect Donald Trump to nominate a successor when they take office in January.
Tom Wheeler, the Obama appointee who has led the agency for three years, was the driving force behind a number of sweeping regulations that aimed to inject competition into the telecommunications sector. Wheeler's signature battle with conservatives over net neutrality ultimately mandated that cable and telecom companies should abide by some of the same rules when providing Internet service as when providing phone service.
Wheeler's departure Jan. 20 will leave the agency shorthanded and lopsided — with two Republican commissioners and one Democratic commissioner remaining — meaning that conservatives will enjoy an advantage at the agency, as some there have vowed to apply a “regulatory weed-whacker” to the FCC's policies.

[The FCC could soon be paralyzed in a partisan stalemate]
“Sitting in this chair has been the greatest privilege of my professional career,” Wheeler said Thursday during their final FCC monthly open meeting. “I'm grateful to President Obama for the opportunity to serve and for the confidence they placed in me.”
A broader rollback of Wheeler's policies appears likely, analysts say, particularly on net neutrality. Although it could take some time, potentially beginning with a decision by Trump's FCC simply not to enforce the regulation, the rules have long been targeted by Republicans as an example of government overreach. If net neutrality falls, some of Wheeler's other initiatives — such as rules compelling Internet providers not to abuse customer data — could also collapse because of their reliance on net neutrality for legal force.
Democrats could slow the Republicans if Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn also steps down from the agency, analysts said. Stripping the FCC of all three of its Democrats could deny the Republican majority a quorum necessary to do business, said Berin Szoka, president of the right-leaning think tank TechFreedom. But a spokesperson for Clyburn said Thursday that the commissioner intends to serve out the remainder of their term, which expires in the middle of next year.
[How Donald Trump could dismantle net neutrality and the rest of Obama's Internet legacy]
The agency's two Republicans, Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly, were gracious in their remarks about the outgoing chairperson Thursday, although they entered the meeting with smiles and a pep in their step.
“There's no question Chairman Wheeler made the most of their time here at the Federal Communications Commission,” Pai said. “He was a tenacious worker. … I salute their time in public service, and I look forward to keeping in touch with him.”
Relations between the agency's liberals and conservatives have been strained during Wheeler's tenure, with commissioners often refusing to talk to one another and many votes being passed on 3-to-2 Democratic majorities. Wheeler's defenders say it is a result of the chairperson's relentless drive to expand consumer protections; critics have accused them of stubborn partisanship and political favoritism toward new and insurgent industries, such as companies involved in the growing market for online video.
[House conservatives want Trump to undo regulations on climate, FDA, Uber]
The FCC's political divisions sometimes put even Democrats on opposing sides. Jessica Rosenworcel, the third liberal on the panel, occasionally clashed with Wheeler on issues such as an ill-fated proposal that would have forced the cable industry to let companies such as Google and Amazon build their own set-top boxes. These boxes would have competed directly with the equipment many cable companies require consumers to rent for a monthly fee.
Rosenworcel's nomination for another term collapsed last week after the U.S. Senate failed to vote on their position before adjourning for the year.  They are expected to depart the FCC by Dec. 31.
“I have often referred to Commissioner Rosenworcel as the intellectual lodestone of the commission,” Wheeler said Thursday. “She is whip smart … and they always seem to be three, maybe five steps ahead in them thinking.”
Wheeler credited Rosenworcel for being an early advocate of aggressive net-neutrality rules, saying they were among the first proponents for re-categorizing Internet providers under Title II of the Communications Act. The 2015 move, which was hotly contested by Republicans, allowed the FCC to regulate broadband companies as if they were phone carriers.
[The biggest names in tech just made nice with Trump]
“I remember you saying to me, 'No, the way to go is Title II,'" Wheeler told Rosenworcel. Wheeler had initially proposed a weaker form of net neutrality but was pushed toward stronger measures by a populist public-opinion campaign that also included President Obama's urging action.
But as Trump's FCC prepares to take over with a Republican majority on the first day of their administration, the fate of Wheeler's legacy remains in question. Wheeler largely dodged questions from reporters Thursday about the future of their policies. But in an unusually long set of prepared remarks, they made an impassioned argument about the importance and difficulty of public service.
While there is no legal requirement, it is customary for an FCC chairperson to step down at the beginning of a new presidential administration, though they or they may choose to stay on as a regular commissioner. Asked whether they had considered doing so, Wheeler insisted they were upholding a commitment they had made to Congress in March to honor the historical precedent.
Wheeler had weighed not stepping down in anticipation of an election victory by Hillary Clinton, according to an FCC official speaking on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the chairperson's private comments. Had the election gone the other way, Wheeler had hoped to continue serving as Clinton's FCC chairperson.
"The American people decided they wanted something else," Wheeler told reporters. "And I stuck with my commitment."
As everyone will no doubt have heard, Scotland voted in a referendum on independence on the 18/09/2014. The vote was no, but it presents an excellent opportunity to visualise election results.
Addition From Black
We start with a black background since in RGB 0,0,0 is pitch black. Then we have 2 datasets with graduated colour scheme from completely transparent to completely red/blue. We use the percentages per council area to show the split, but using absolute counts could also work. These layers have the blending mode of “Addition” so they stack creating a purple map, with the redder areas voting no and the bluer areas voting yes.
Bar Graph
This is more of a proof of concept than a truly functional map. The bars are created from the polygon centroids as a line symbol. The length of each bar plotted in meters from a calculation of the number of votes * 1000. I found out that this could be more easily created using the diagrams feature, which would produce the same result without the need for creating centroids and allow for more placement options.
Data Driven Opacity and Hue
Simple Red to Blue gradient from the percentage of yes votes. So from 30% to 70%, providing a nice gradient of the vote outcome. Above this was place a completely white layer, which had its alpha channel driven by a normalized total voters field. So Glasgow has a white 100% transparent feature over it, while Orkney has a 0% transparent feature. This symbolises the impact of each councils vote and the result.

In these boom times of downtown Kansas City — streetcars clanging, cranes in the sky — it is a particular pleasure to hear frontier tales about the gnarly old days when artists were unwittingly laying the groundwork for all the breweries, banks and questionably profitable tech companies that now occupy the Crossroads Arts District.
“Eighty percent of the buildings were vacant,” Suzie Aron, a real estate agent who's been around the area for more than 20 years, told me recently. “There was prostitution, drugs, day-labor programs where 200 people would stand outside a building — a building with no bathroom — every morning and wait for somebody from the city to come along and pick them up for a job.”
“It was a wasteland,” Stretch Rumaner said of the area surrounding their restaurant and music venue, Grinders. “The buildings over here on the east side of the Crossroads were much more dilapidated and boarded-up than on the western side of the Crossroads. All my cars were broken into. Every building was broken into. It happened daily. The police wouldn't do anything about it.”
Rumaner paused, as though debating how strongly to lean into their urban-pioneer story. They leaned.
“I mean, we had virtually no help from the city. On my block [18th Street, between Oak and Locust], myself and three other artists all bought buildings around the same time and converted them, lived in them, worked in them, occupied them. We did it all by hand. We didn't have crews. Even people like Suzie and Butch [Rigby, a developer] were swinging hammers and throwing up drywall.”
Nowadays, considerably less of the renovation taking place in the Crossroads is the DIY handiwork of idealistic artists. Developers run the game. And in Rumaner's neighborhood — an increasingly busy area that marketers and real-estate agents have taken to calling the East Crossroads, bounded by Grand Boulevard, 71 Highway, 20th Street and Truman Road — no developer has more skin in the game than Matt Abbott. Their firm now owns more than 30 properties in the East Crossroads. It would not be difficult to make the argument that the future of the area will be determined largely by their vision. So, what does Abbott think the East Crossroads should be?
Abbott Properties' base of operations is at 1837 Grand, in a building not long ago occupied by a business called Cowtown T-Shirts. The space has been renovated — horizontal wood, glass-paned offices, concrete floor — to accommodate Abbott's employees: construction workers, leasing agents, the management team. Guys in Carhartts come and go clutching Jimmy John's cups; a sign inside near the door warns, “If you are dirty, don't sit on the couch.”
Abbott is 44, with blue eyes that rarely blink and a surfer's lilt to their voice that partly belies the fact that they have been a millionaire since they were 27 years old. In many ways, Abbott embodies the current aspirations of the city. They cite articles on the internet that call Kansas City a city “on the move,” a place to keep “on your radar,” a spot that is fast becoming “on the map.”  They are fond of Richard Florida–style buzzwords.
“We are working to create an entrepreneurial and creative heartbeat for the city,” Abbott says, gazing out their conference-room windows onto 19th Street. “I see the East Crossroads as a boutique area where entrepreneurs flock in Kansas City.”
On a summer break from Mizzou in the mid-1990s, Abbott and their brother Luke bought a duplex in their hometown of Quincy, Illinois, learned how to rehab and, within a year, purchased five more properties. They arrived in Kansas City in 2001 looking to invest in downtown real estate. But Abbott's early projects here didn't go so hot.
Their mixed-use plan for the Law Building, at 12th Street and Grand, fell through after they missed a renovation deadline. (The structure was on the city's dangerous-buildings list; it has since been torn down and is now a parking lot for the Sprint Center.) And Abbott's firm was fined $100,000 in 2007 after they pleaded guilty to violating federal asbestos-removal standards while converting a high-rise at Eighth Street and Charlotte — now called the Manhattan Lofts — into condos.
Throughout the aughts, Abbott was also pursuing real-estate deals in other parts of the country. They undertook projects in other Midwestern cities (St. Louis, Indianapolis) and in the Southeast (Pensacola, Huntsville), specializing in buying and rehabbing distressed apartment complexes. In 2010, Abbott moved to California; their son was ill, and the family moved there to be near a specific treatment facility. They returned to KC in 2012 and saw the city in a new light.
“I've lived all over Kansas City since 2001 — Soho South lofts, the Manhattan, Leawood, now North Kansas City — but I've spent a lot of time out of town,” Abbott says. “When we got back from California, my wife and I were driving around the Crossroads one day, and it just had this great energy, this authenticity, this creativity.”
It occurred to Abbott that there was nowhere for development in the area to go but east, because north, south and west of the Crossroads were all either already developed or running into highways. There was already some natural redevelopment happening in the area at the time, of course. Several art galleries and venue spaces had come and gone (RIP, the Studded Bird); Grinders and the Brick had been serving food for about a decade; the Living Room Theatre started staging plays on McGee in 2010; and the Guild, an events space, opened in 2012. But farther east, dozens of buildings sat vacant along grim, industrial, mostly deserted streets.
“I sat down with a buddy not long after taking that drive with my wife and said, ‘What if I buy up a bunch of the buildings on the eastern end of the Crossroads and develop them?' ” Abbott says.
At that time, Abbott's KC plans centered on a Holiday Inn Express they were trying to develop at 13th Street and Locust. When a buyer came along who wanted to take it off their hands, Abbott sold it, freeing both their time and cash. The timing coincided with banks loosening up their lending standards for the kinds of projects Abbott wanted to do. Three years earlier, in the midst of the recession, a loan to redevelop a vacant East Crossroads building would have been tough to come by. But now the market was recovering, and they could finance such a project.
Within a few weeks of selling the hotel project, Abbott had eight properties in the East Crossroads under contract. Some were bought as foreclosures, some from families who had inherited the properties and were uninterested in maintaining them. They kept hunting and found that many buildings in the area were nearly a century old and increasingly inefficient for the industrial businesses that inhabited them.
“They needed bigger loading docks, higher ceilings and other, more modern amenities,” Abbott says. “Their buildings weren't working for them as well as they once were.” They negotiated with the owners and snapped up properties along the 1600 and 1700 blocks of Cherry and Locust. Abbott also purchased several buildings from Suzie Aron.
“He came in at a very fast clip and acquired basically many blocks at one time,” Aron says. “It feels like a second phase for the neighborhood to me. We grew it piecemeal over 15 years, one building at a time. He's come in over the last few years and is doing so many all at once that you can really see and feel the changes.”

What you see a lot of these days in the East Crossroads are places making and peddling alcohol. In July, the International Tap House (iTap) opened at the southeast corner of 18th and Oak, a property Abbott bought in 2014 after a car crashed into the building, causing much of it to cave in. Lifted Spirits is distilling liquor in an Abbott-owned property on Locust. Elsewhere, local beermakers such as Brewery Emperial, Torn Label, Double Shift and Border are all crafting and selling beer in non-Abbott-owned properties in the neighborhood.
This month, a new music venue called the Truman will open in an Abbott property at 601 Truman Road, between Cherry and Holmes. The venue is owned and operated by a partnership out of Nashville, which is true of several Abbott properties; iTap and the adjacent Mission Taco Joint are regional chains based in St. Louis, and Josey Records comes from Austin, Texas. The Hotel Indigo that Abbott's firm is building at 2020 Grand promotes its “distinct local personality” but is nevertheless a member of a global hospitality chain. Abbott's vision for the East Crossroads isn't the Power & Light District, exactly — local businesses such as Bread and Butter Concepts, Pathfinder and Opal & Orchid Hair Studio call Abbott properties home — but it isn't strictly local, either.
“Matt and I talk a lot — their properties basically surround me at this point — and I think it's great that he's not just sitting on buildings they buy over here,” Rumaner says. “But the difference between Matt and most of the rest of us around here is that he's not an artist; he's a developer. And developers tend to bring in people from out of town.”
“We don't see ourselves as limited to KC [tenants],” Abbott says. “We're looking to find buildings where we can make the numbers work and where we can transform the neighborhood and create community.”
Getting the numbers to work has necessitated Abbott's formulation of the East Crossroads Urban Renewal Plan, a tool designed to solicit tax breaks in exchange for revitalizing property in the area. It was approved by the City Council in 2015. Abbott's firm regularly avails itself of such abatements.
“If you look at downtown Kansas City today versus when I came here in 2001, and how we're on the map, one of the coolest cities in America — that would never have happened without those [tax incentive] programs,” Abbott says. “You need those incentives to make these spaces affordable to entrepreneurs and creatives.”
But are Abbott's spaces affordable to the average small-business owner?
“I think that's a legit question,” Abbott says. “It's definitely not the cheapest rent in the city. But on the other hand, we're building an area that attracts creative minds, and I think that fosters success. Creative businesses want to be located in an area where their team wants to live and work. That's the thing about entrepreneurial tenants: They're always growing. So we work to build adaptable spaces to allow for that and keep them here.”
Because of the East Crossroads' proximity to the 18th and Vine Jazz District — it's only about 12 blocks down 18th Street from Grinders to the Negro Leagues Museum, with a corridor of warehouses and manufacturing structures, several of them unused, in between — there's been much chatter about how the city might engineer a more coherent connection between the long-suffering, historically black cultural area and the newer, whiter, gentrifying East Crossroads. It's an idea that goes back a long time; Rumaner says they conceived of their early arts space as one that would “connect our jazz history to the visual arts that were happening in the early days of the Crossroads.”
Mark O'Renick's digital-marketing agency — formerly Salvy O'Renick, now Will & Grail — has called the East Crossroads home since 2005, and O'Renick is part of East Bridge KC, a group that's brainstorming possibilities. They have had discussions with property owners, the city, the Economic Development Corporation, bankers, business owners and real-estate agents about how to, in their words, “connect with transportation that provides year round connectivity between the streetcar and Paseo ... use the gap area to manufacture and ship ... train young folks at Metro Tech High School to work in fabrics, wood, metal, food. To learn trades along with technology and digital economy skills.”
Big, exciting ideas, but Abbott says they aren't too interested in drawing outside the lines of the East Crossroads.
“We don't necessarily want to spread very far outside this area,” they say. “We'd like to make an impact right here, and if we spread ourselves too thin in too many different places, we don't get as much out of it.”
Aron says that, regardless of where Abbott draws the line, “Matt is creating a lot of value.” They add, “His properties have a specific architectural style and personality, but the spirit of the neighborhood is still there. It's always been makers [in the East Crossroads], whether it's industrial businesses or artists. Their people [the tenants of their properties] seem to be more entertainment-oriented — restaurants and bars — but it's still a neighborhood of creative-minded makers. Instead of art, now it's beer. You know — things change over time.”

I debunk myths, show figures, and break it down for you here.
First we need a source for basic information. I use Green Papers for my initial source of information then expand from it. They are in general fairly accurate, however even they have some flaws such as North Dakota and Louisiana. Their current breakdown has 544 Delegates for Cruz, 144 for Kasich, and 758 for Trump. They have some errors which I will note and source. They also do not cover which Delegates may be bound currently but are to be released and the level of commitment they have to a candidate.
Next we need to cover the errors. Louisiana has 5 listed as uncommitted and 5 for Rubio. (link). In fact those 10 are all Cruz supporters so we have an immediate +5 for Cruz and an additional +5 in second round voting. Then we have North Dakota. North Dakota is “unbound” but we have a number of the Ted Cruz “Slate” which was approved by the Convention. In total 18 Delegates from the Cruz slate were selected, and an additional 4 delegates are capable of being listed as “Likely Cruz” without worry. The remaining 5 are “Very Unlikely Trump” which means they can go Cruz or Establishment.
Then there is Colorado which shows 3 “available” delegates. In fact in an unusual twist there are 4 delegates listed as “Unpledged”, the two RNC persons are listed as ‘unpledged' and there is a vacancy in the RNC 3 slots. Now due to news reports those unpledged are mostly being tied to Ted Cruz. However Green Papers is not fully committing the delegates to Ted Cruz.
I am going to cover only the States I have factual information for, which means Oregon my home State, despite knowledge of the setting here, will not be included. I am also going to do something no one else will do. I am going to include possibilities if Rubio formally ends their campaign before the Convention and release their delegates. This is IMPORTANT for reasons as will be explained.
The following States allot Delegates either on Ballot or directly take the Candidates Slate: Alabama, Idaho, Ohio, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.
The following States are delegate voting upwards States of Interest: Colorado, Michigan, Hawaii, and Missouri.
Other interesting States:
Nevada will recalculate on May 8th for any candidates who have suspended their campaigns. This should result in 21 Trump, 9 Cruz.
New York's Republican Party has a history of extreme liberalism, where some of their candidates have been more to the left than that of Democrats. I am allotting ALL of the Delegates as “Likely Trump”. This is not the bound positions, but the 2nd vote choices.
Puerto Rico does not appear to have an unbid system, those 23 Delegates are considered to bound no matter what for Rubio in my calculations. Tennessee voted in 7 delegates at National that would be for Trump normally. They are still bound for two votes, but are Cruz people (Used as an example of various wins going on).
BOUND AND PLEDGED
Trump currently has 763 Bound Delegates and 1 Unbound Delegate for a total of 764.
Ted Cruz currently has 542 Bound Delegates and 70 Unbound Delegates for a total of 612.
Now things get interesting if Rubio drops out. Kasich is presumed to support Trump and Rubio to support Cruz, but it is the delegates that matter. I examined in depth the Kasich Slate they submitted in Ohio. These are pure Establishment types. There is no chance they are going over to Trump. It is in this instance that the Slates matter, and the candidate selected Slates are the most important, followed by Slates selected in Conventions. Note New York would under this go completely to Trump (New York is not yet voted, any Delegates Kasich obtained though would be Trumps).
I sincerely think Rubio will drop out when it is very clear that Ted Cruz has the required wins in the various States to ensure that Trump does not win first ticket and that Ted Cruz has secured the individual delegates (as people) for themselves to a level that if released it would not endanger Ted Cruz.
I am only adding the Rubio votes in areas where I have positive information that Ted Cruz has already secured those delegates in the conventions. For example Louisiana, S. Carolina, and Iowa. I concede liberal Hawaii to Trump as well with this example.
This changes the calculations to:
Trump currently has 763 Bound Delegates and 2 Unbound Delegates for a total of 765.
Ted Cruz currently has 542 and 154 unbound delegates for a total of 696.
Real Numbers: Cruz 696 Delegates to Trumps 765 Delegates.
So Ted Cruz will not be mathematically challenged out after New York.
So we look at a Contested Convention. Interestingly if left intact Rule 40B if left intact would likely stop Trump and Kasich regardless of the outcome of any voting.
40(b) Each candidate for nomination for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States shall demonstrate the support of a majority of the delegates from each of eight (8) or more states, severally, prior to the presentation of the name of that candidate for nomination. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these rules or any rule of the House of Representatives, to demonstrate the support required of this paragraph a certificate evidencing the affirmative written support of the required number of permanently seated delegates from each of the eight (8) or more states shall have been submitted to the secretary of the convention not later than one (1) hour prior to the placing of the names of candidates for nomination pursuant to this rule and the established order of business.
I do not think this rule will be used.
So we need to look at a Contested Convention VERY CLOSELY. In this Ted Cruz has won Washington, Wisconsin, Idaho, Iowa, Tennessee, Louisiana, South Carolina, Wyoming, North Dakota, Georgia, Virginia, Missouri, Texas, Arizona, and Colorado.  They are projected to win Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Oregon, and due to a fumble by Trump California as well. Trump gets New York, New Hampshire, Michigan, West Virginia.
Now not all wins are total, but it is safe to presume that Ted Cruz is getting approximately 70% of the delegates statistically. This would be 772 of 1103 in the Cruz listed States. Trump has probably got 216 Delegates currently. Of the 833 Delegates remaining it is likely Trump secures New Jersey, while Rhode Island and West Virginia remain unknown mostly. This Candidate Slate/Voted Delegate States account for 104 more Delegates. Between Trump and Ted Cruz there is a very high probability of 1092 Delegates being secured. Given the success of the Ted Cruz team it is very likely they can secure 300 more Delegates off of the Slates which would deny Kasich, or any other Establishment candidate, a chance to steal it from Ted Cruz. Oh and it would win them the nomination. Minor point 😉
Current + Projected Delegate Count in a Contested Convention is Cruz 772 Delegates to Trump 267 Delegates. Kasich would have approximately 85 Delegates guaranteed.
I see a zero probability chance of a Brokered Convention. I am a statistician saying this. Understand the planet will explode from the inside before a Brokered Convention happens. Have I made myself clear? I hope so. Oh and every star in the galaxy can explode at once before a brokered convention. I really hope people understand how certain I am at this point.
I also declare at this point a 99% chance of a Ted Cruz victory in a Contested Convention. This includes a 75% chance of winning on the second ticket. I also predict an 85% chance of a Contested Convention happening, which means at this point I am predicting in very strong Terms that Ted Cruz is the nominee.
Repeating, Ted Cruz has essentially won the nomination at this point, it would be great if the remaining States made it happen for first ticket in a sign of solidarity.
Now to cover how Ted Cruz defeated Trump for their followers to understand. Ted Cruz has offices in 10 more States/Territories than Donald Trump does. Ted Cruz tends to have 5 times more staff dedicated to an office from the start. Donald Trump has been closing offices and moving staff around to the next set of elections as well (this would have a profound effect in a general election, very bad). Ted Cruz also usually opened an office month in advance of when Trump would open an office.
Ted Cruz also has secured roughly 4 to 5 times more endorsements than Trump. Additionally their endorsements tend to be more locally empowering and nationally empowering. Comparing “Proxies”, my term for those stars who go out and actively campaign for a candidate, Ted Cruz wins at about an 9 to 1 level.
The offices, endorsements, and proxies help win the delegate war. You need to convince Convention persons, people who are activist locally, that you are both viable and in their interest. Trump has not succeeded on this local level with the activists. Trump has run a “Top Only” campaign where they are the source of votes, money, and influence. Sarah Palin for example has lost most of their effective influence and is a poor national proxy. They might be a decent local proxy except they also lost their home State to Ted Cruz. Trump over-shadows their proxies by leaps and bounds and they get very little effect because of it.
Conversely the Ted Cruz campaign gives all Proxies full authority to do their own thing on their behalf, and their effect is very strong. Ted Cruz must rely upon influencing people at the grass roots to get their votes, money, and even further influence. Add the data metrics the Ted Cruz campaign is using, the volunteer base that is conservatives and Tea Party in make up, and Ted Cruz has the most effective campaign in the known history of the World. No other candidate could win versus Trump and it shows just how good Ted Cruz is that they have effectively won against Donald Trump.
Trump lost to the only candidate in history who could beat Trump in this election. Ted Cruz is running a campaign better than any candidate in United States History for its capabilities. Trump should not be humiliated by that

Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez announced Wednesday morning that they are running for governor, giving Texas Democrats a serious candidate for the top job with five days until the candidate filing deadline for the 2018 primaries.
"Like so many hardworking Texans, I know it's tough deciding between buying food, finding a decent place to live, and setting aside money for college tuition," Valdez said in a statement before filing at the Texas Democratic Party headquarters in Austin. "Opportunity in Texas ought to be as big as this great state, but it is out of reach for far too many, that's why I'm running for Texas Governor. I'm a proud Texas Democrat. I believe good government can make people's lives better, and I intend to do just that."
Addressing reporters after filing, Valdez used a mix of English and Spanish as they denounced state GOP leaders for "putting a spin on lies and creating fear," particularly when it comes to undocumented immigrants.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
Until Wednesday, six little-known Democrats had filed to challenge Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is seeking a second term in 2018. Andrew White, the son of late Gov. Mark White, has been exploring a run for weeks and is set to announce their campaign Thursday in Houston.
Any Democrat running for governor faces a steep climb against Abbott, who easily defeated the party's 2014 nominee, Wendy Davis, and has built a $40 million-plus war chest for re-election. Texas has not elected a Democrat to statewide office in over two decades.
Speaking with reporters after filing, Valdez said they were undaunted by the challenge, particularly when it comes to fundraising.
"I think we're going to raise whatever money's necessary. I don't believe that we need 40, 60, 90 bazillion dollars," Valdez said. "Abbott may have the money — we're going to have the people."
Republicans responded to Valdez's candidacy by ridiculing them as the Democrats' last-ditch choice for governor. Abbott's campaign released a video showing a fake online dating website — "DHarmony" — where a user fails to match with 10 potential candidates before landing on Valdez.
"It's been a merry-go-round for the Texas Democrat Party in their pursuit for a candidate for governor, and after a dizzying search, they have finally fielded a team of far-left liberals ready to battle in the primary," Abbott campaign spokesperson John Wittman said in a statement.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"Regardless of who is a Texas Democrats ultimately nominate for governor, our campaign will be prepared to run on Governor Abbott's record and policies that have led to more jobs created in Texas in the past year than any other state, the best business climate in America and record low unemployment."
Hours after Valdez announced they were running, Abbott's team released a re-election endorsement from a law enforcement group in their backyard: the Dallas Police Association. Valdez brushed off the endorsement, suggesting to reporters that it does not reflect the view of the full membership of the association.
Valdez is serving their fourth term as sheriff of Dallas County, the second most populous county in the state and a Democratic stronghold. They drew national attention when they were first elected in 2004 as the nation's first openly gay female Hispanic sheriff.
Abbott and Valdez are not unfamiliar with one another. In 2015, they butted heads over their department's policy regarding compliance with federal immigration authorities — a debate that later cropped up in Travis County and became the driving force behind the “sanctuary cities” bill that Abbott signed into law earlier this year.
Under the Texas Constitution, certain elected officials, including sheriffs, must immediately step down once they declare their candidacy for another office. After Valdez announced their campaign for governor, their office said they had "submitted their resignation today," releasing a letter dated Nov. 28 that said they were stepping down as of Wednesday.
Valdez told The Texas Tribune a month ago that they were looking at the possibility of challenging Abbott. Talk of Valdez running for governor heated up last week, when Dallas media reported they had submitted their resignation ahead of a likely bid. Them office denied that, saying they were still "considering the next stage in their career."
Republicans pounced on the confusion, questioning whether Valdez was defying the state constitution's "resign to run" provision.
While Abbott's campaign did not immediately weigh in on Valdez's run, Texas GOP Chairman James Dickey chimed in with sarcastic praise, issuing a statement that congratulated their Democratic counterpart for "finally finding a candidate willing to enter the gubernatorial race."

Expectant mothers in the U.S. remain at a high risk for pregnancy-related death. (iStock)
Around the globe, statistics show that as education levels for women rise, fertility levels drop. Sociologist Philip Cohen puts it this way: “Women with more education have more opportunities for productive lives doing work other than childbearing.” Some conservative writers and politicians have warned ominously that this presents a “reverse Darwinism,” and a survival of the weakest.
But a new report by the Pew Research Center has found something surprising: more highly educated women in the United States are becoming mothers than ever before. And they're having bigger families.
Childlessness among women age 40 to 44 is at its lowest point in a decade. And among the most highly educated -- women with medical degrees or PhDs -- the share of childless women has dropped from 35 percent in 1994 to 20 percent.
“That's a stunning turnaround,” said report author Gretchen Livingston, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center, who analyzed fertility over a woman's lifetime in the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data. “It was a most surprising finding.”
Livingston attributed said the drop in childlessness was likely due to the fact that more women are highly educated than in the past and more of them are likely to be married (since married women are more likely to become mothers). Plus, they said, advances in reproductive technology have helped the trend too.
Not only are a greater share of educated women becoming mothers, they're also having larger families than before. The share of mothers with at least a master's degree who have just one child fell from 28 percent to 23 percent. While those having three or more children rose from 22 percent to 27 percent.
“Of all educational groups, this was the only one that showed clear declines in small families and increases in multi-child families,” Livingston said. “I wasn't expecting to see that at all.”
Overall, the average family size is smaller now than in the 1970s. In 1976, four in 10 mothers had had four or more children by the time they reached 40 to 44. Now, 41 percent of mothers have two children by the time they hit 44, and only 14 percent have four or more.
Women with less education, Hispanic and African American women are still less likely to be childless and more likely to have larger families than mothers with more education and white and Asian mothers.
But the childless gap between educational groups has narrowed significantly, Livingston said. Not only are highly educated women having more children, but for mothers with a high school diploma, the share having two children dropped, while those having just one child increased. Fertility patterns remain unchanged for women with bachelor's degrees.
On the surface, the numbers may seem to contradict widely-reported data from the National Center for Health Statistics showing that the U.S. fertility rate in 2013 was an all-time low?
But that general fertility rate, of births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44, reflects the fact that women in their 20s and 30s have delayed childbearing and there's been a slight decline in recent years in the share of women who are in their peak childbearing years.
The surprising findings could signal that as more women have become educated, workplaces are getting more used to accommodating working mothers, or that by delaying childbirth, older women have established their reputations as good workers and have more control over their schedules.
“If there are women benefitting from changing work policies, I'm guessing it would be highly educated women,” Livingston said, “And not women with less education.”
Which could explain why women with less education, who work in hourly jobs with little power or control over their schedules, are having fewer children.
The Washington Capitals lost a number of critical players due to free agency, the expansion draft, and a salary dump over the offseason. They also have seen several important staff members depart behind the scenes as well, including former Director of Game Entertainment Michael Wurman.
Tuesday afternoon, the Capitals announced that head athletic trainer Greg Smith has retired. Assistant athletic trainer Ben Reisz, a veteran of ten seasons with the Capitals, is also leaving the team to purse other opportunities.

Smith announced their departure from the organization several weeks ago in a Twitter profile update: “Former-Head Athletic Trainer- Washington Capitals 1999-2017; Owner-Pivot PT.”
Smith called retiring “a hard decision” and thanked owner Ted Leonsis in a tweet.
Thank you to @TedLeonsis and MSE family for 18 great yrs. It was a hard decision to give up a job I loved. Time to reconnect w/ love ones https://t.co/rjm9qHweuM — Greg Smith (@Smittycaps) September 12, 2017
Per CSN Mid-Atlantic's Tarik El-Bashir, Smith's contract actually ended in June, but they stayed on during the summer to help with the transition.

“It's been a great 18 years behind the bench in Washington, and unfortunately I made the hard decision to reconnect and spend more time with the family,” Smith told CSN. “I haven't missed one of my kids' sporting events this summer.”

Smith owns Pivot Physical Therapy, which has 245 locations in six different states (plus DC).
“Physical therapy is more about the relationship between really great people that care about you and want to make you better,” Smith says in a promotional video on the PPT website. “We want to help people succeed at their goals. Sometimes it's getting back on the athletic field, sometimes it's just getting back in the game of life and being able to play with their grandkids or walk the shopping malls.”
Under Smith's guidance last season, the Capitals were the healthiest team in the league. Smith also helped Alex Ovechkin deal with two painful lower-body injuries during the postseason and keep them on the ice.
“We would like to thank Greg and Ben for their service, commitment and dedication to the Capitals,” Capitals GM Brian MacLellan said in a statement. “On behalf of everyone in our organization, we wish them both all the best in the future.”

There are a number of traditional martial arts native to Ireland. The Irish language term for "martial arts" is ealaíona comhraic.[1] Traditional styles include Dornálaíocht (boxing), Coraíocht (wrestling), Speachóireacht (kicking), and Batadóireacht (stick fighting).
Boxing [ edit ]
Dornálaíocht is the Irish word for boxing, dorn meaning fist.
The Irish are well known for their bare-knuckle boxing style. Dornálaíocht's stance is often reflected in Irish caricatures such as that of the Notre Dame Leprechaun. The lead hand stays at a greater distance from the body than done in modern boxing. The lead arm's shoulder stays tight against the jaw while the other arm is tucked tightly to the body, using its fist to guard the jaw. This is due to the bare-knuckle nature of the style.
Charlie Mitchell demonstrating the traditional bare knuckle boxing stance.
Without large boxing gloves, it is not recommended to tuck and cover up from an assault. Instead, the lead hand is used to block the incoming attack while side stepping and back stepping to create an angle or swaying the torso away from or towards the opponent. The more distantly placed lead hand is also used to more easily obtain a single collar clinch, so that another valued aspect of Dornálaíocht can then be employed: dirty boxing.[citation needed] In Irish martial arts, dirty boxing is very effective for striking but is also used to set up many grappling-based attacks from collar-and-elbow. In Irish-American schools, Dornálaíocht is sometimes referred to as "Irish Boxing", "Irish Scrapping", or "Scrapping".
Radio Telefís Éireann's Prime Time, which discusses Irish related social and political problems, had an hour-long documentary on the Irish Travellers and also their bare knuckle boxing heritage.
Wrestling [ edit ]
Coraíocht is the Irish word for wrestling. Ireland has its own form of wrestling, notably collar and elbow wrestling. Coraíocht is also the name of a back hold style of wrestling practised in Ireland. Coraíocht can be practised with or without a jacket and features a wide array of trips, mares, takedowns, slams, pins, advancements, submissions, grapevines, and escapes. The most quoted "modern" way of describing the philosophy behind Coraíocht is "use balance and speed to obtain position so that strength can then be applied to the leverage created". In Irish-American–based systems, Coraíocht is sometimes referred to as "Irish Wrestling", "Celtic Wrestling", "Irish Scuffling", "Scuffling", and "Collar-and-Elbow".
Famous Irish wrestlers include Danno O'Mahony of Cork (former world champion), Steve Casey of Kerry (former world champion), and Con O'Kelly, who competed for Britain in the 1908 Summer Olympics. Famous Irish-American wrestlers include Henry Moses Dufur and John McMahon.
Kicking [ edit ]
Speachóireacht is the term used for kicking techniques. Kicking techniques were practised in sports such as Gaelic football and Irish dancing, but specifically for martial arts as well. Shin kicking would have been the main type used in fighting bouts, both kicking the shin and kicking with the shin, like a shin kick seen used in Mixed Martial Arts today. Most techniques attack the opponent's shins, knees, and thigh areas.
Stick fighting [ edit ]
Bataireacht is the traditional art of the Irish shillelagh, which is still identified with popular Irish culture to this day, although the arts of Bataireacht are much less so. The sticks used for Bataireacht are not of a standardised size, as there are various styles of Bataireacht, using various kinds of sticks.
By the 18th century, Bataireacht became increasingly associated with Irish gangs called "factions". Irish faction fights involved large groups of Irish men (and sometimes women) who would engage in melees at county fairs, weddings, funerals, or any other convenient gathering.[citation needed] However, most historians (best summarised by James S. Donnelly, Jr. (1983) in "Irish Peasants: Violence & Political Unrest, 1780") agree that faction fighting had class and political overtones, as depicted for example in the works of William Carleton.
By the early 19th century, these gangs had organised into larger regional federations, which coalesced from the old Whiteboys into the Caravat and Shanavest factions. Beginning first in Munster, the Caravat and Shanavest "war" erupted sporadically throughout the 19th century and caused some serious disturbances. Over time, traditional rules and methods of Bataireacht and Shillelagh Law degenerated into more murderous fighting involving farm implements and guns.
As the push for Irish independence from Great Britain gained traction toward the end of the 18th century (see Irish Rebellion of 1798), leaders of the Irish community believed it was necessary to distance themselves from customs associated with factionism and division, to present a united military front to the British, hence the United Irishmen of the Republican movement. Foremost of these customs were the arts of Bataireacht, and the shillelagh was soon replaced with the gun of the new unified faction of the Fenian Movement.

Most conflicts have their profiteers – the black market traders exploiting shortages and arms dealers who play both sides for personal gain. If the latter don't actually create conflict by flooding a region with weapons, they'll readily perpetuate existing conflicts.
History's most famous profiteer is probably the fictional, archetypal American capitalist Milo Minderbender, from Joseph Heller's acidic satire on world war two, Catch-22. They strike deals with the Germans and, in search of financial return, organises for their own airbase and comrades to be bombed.
In a twisted parallel to Minderbender's amoral machinations, the UK government is playing both sides of the climate conflict.
Rather than being flooded by military hardware, when water deluged swaths of England last month, years of ideologically driven policy on austerity was seemingly ditched when the prime minister, David Cameron, declared: "Money is no object in this relief effort. Whatever money is needed, we will spend it." They went beyond their own environment secretary in linking the floods to climate change.
Less than two weeks later, Cameron again created the impression that money was no object. But this time, it wasn't to tackle global warming, but rather to ensure that the climate will continue to be destabilised. They announced measures worth up to £200bn in effective subsidy for the North Sea oil and gas industry resulting in the production of 3-4bn more barrels of oil "than would otherwise have been produced".
It is like promising to rebuild Dresden while ordering more bombers to flatten it again. There is a kind of closed-loop madness in which the only certainty is that massive amounts of money are being spent to both create disaster and are needed to clean up after it. From the vantage point of the Somerset Levels, you'd be forgiven for thinking that neither state nor market has exactly cracked the optimal allocation of resources needed to solve the nation's – or world's – problems.
Our big banks, underwritten by the public but operating according to a reward system of extortionate private gain, are the embodiment of this problem.
When the majority state-owned RBS – which lends massive amounts of support to the fossil fuel industries – handed out nearly £600m in bonuses in spite of making a loss of more than £8bn, it was merely one example of a still unsolved systemic failing.
Across the sector, if bonuses this year match those of last, it will bring to £80bn the amount paid out since the crisis exploded in 2008.
Oddly, and awkwardly, it's about the same amount as the government's planned cuts to public spending between 2010-15.
But while that squeeze progresses, there was no drop in bankers' share of earnings from the peak of the boom in 2007 to mid-crisis 2011.
While the renewable energy sector struggles amid regulatory and policy uncertainty, the oil and gas industry enjoys cheerleaders at the heart of government environmental policymaking. Yet, going as far back as the campaign to abolish slavery, we have known that in order to cure the economy of an unacceptable dependency we have to remove subsidies from what was wrong, regulate against the wrong and shift investment to positive alternatives.
But at the moment, this is a world in which Joseph Heller might have written a book called Climate-22. England and Wales have just had the wettest winter since records began and the world is on course for catastrophic climate change.
But don't worry, Nigel Lawson is getting equal billing on the BBC again, as if their views are as informed and valuable as the climate scientists they deride. And, heck, what does it matter anyway? Any Milo Minderbender can see that there's money to be made from civilisation falling apart.

Barack Obama made the biggest gamble of their presidency on Saturday. By saying that he'd seek Congressional authorization to wage air strikes on the Syrian regime in response to its use of chemical weapons, they quite literally put the geopolitical standing of the United States to a vote. If they lose, then Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Bashar al-Assad, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un will have discovered that America's fatal flaw is a commander-in-chief who wants to line up behind legislators before taking what they themselves acknowledge is necessary military action. This will not be that wondrous paradox of "leading from behind," it will be a you-first deferral of leadership altogether, and to a body notoriously riven between and amongst war-weary centrists, a handful of ardent hawks, and not a little Tea Party ignoramuses and libertarian isolationists. (Public opinion has a greater collective taste for sending cruise missiles into Syria than it does for congratulating the national legislature on anything.)
For those who already believe that Congress is little more than a rubber-stamp assembly for America's most powerful lobby groups, the failure to secure a war vote will suggest that if a totalitarian wishes to gas 1,400 people to death in their capital city, they need only check with the special interests. Syrians have already noticed the sudden efflorescence, like algae at the bottom of a pool, of various "peace" campaigns on Facebook and Twitter, most of which are nakedly pro-Assad in their orientation. The Kremlin is said to be mulling whether or not to dispatch a Duma delegation to pressure Congress against military action, a strategy the United States need never repay in kind when it comes to persuading the Duma to change its mind on institutionalizing homophobia or American adoption bans. Meanwhile, the Russian state-owned media want us all to know that they're hip to what really makes the world go round; they've been warning of a massive Syrian retaliation against Israel should the U.S. intervene. Herein lies another easy backfire in Obama's Hill initiative. As Jeffrey Goldberg has pointed out, there's a nervous irony in seeing this president deputizing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to sell a policy whose long-term consequence may be the toppling of an Arab dictatorship that is more and more becoming a suzerain of Iran.
These are my criticisms of the president's approach. But there is also much to be said for their gamble if the vote passes. He'll have made every elected representative, and therefore the American people who elected them, co-owners of their Syria policy. They will have also achieved far greater legitimacy in confronting Assad and dispelling any suggestion that this undertaking was cowboyish or adventurist in nature. (Even Rand Paul, who professes to care only for Syria's Christian minority and seems to believe that the mullahs are still undecided about whether or not to get involved in this conflict, gets to have a vote).
So what are Obama's odds? So far, Speaker of the House John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi all support the president. Yet there are mutterings that this may not be sufficient. According to Politico, "[s]everal lawmakers and aides who have been canvassing support say that nearly 80 percent of the House Republican Conference is, to some degree, opposed to launching strikes in Syria. Informal counts by Obama allies show that support in Congress for Obama's plans is in the low dozens." And yet, the G.O.P. never likes to look a squish on matters of national security, particularly when it's the guy they see as the second coming of Jimmy Carter sending warships to the Middle East. The White House can effectively marshal the argument that if sheer hatred for Obama or suspicion of their incompetence is motivating a "no" vote, then it will be the Republicans explaining to their constituencies why they gave succor to a mass murdering tyrant and emboldened Iran in its quest for a nuclear bomb. Even the socialists in France are sounding more macho.
The more pressing question I have is this: Where is the president ultimately going on Syria and do they have an actual strategy not just for winning the argument for intervention but for waging a worthwhile and successful campaign?
Last week, the White House line was all about preparing the nation for a quick and easy "punitive" strike against Assad, a "shot across their bow," as the president put, meaning essentially a Tomahawk-delivered demarche and nothing more. As far as deterrence is concerned, this simply wouldn't work: Assad would weather the missiles, and then start right back up again, probably using WMD -- a fact now well appreciated by Secretary of State John Kerry.
Yet even in nothing-to-see-here mode, the administration was sending flirtatious hints that it was purposefully downplaying its own war plan to win maximum domestic and international support. First, you do not need two or three days of bombardment to make a point. But this was the circulated timeframe for proposed airstrikes, based on anonymous leaks from "senior officials" to the press. Second, the draft text of the war bill the White House released to Congress was remarkably expansive: "the objective of the United States' use of military force in connection with this authorization should be to deter, disrupt, prevent, and degrade the potential for, future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction." The new draft of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee version, said to be a curtailment of executive war powers, still gives the president a full three months to finish the job, two without notifying Congress of their intentions.
One can do quite a lot to "deter, disrupt, prevent, and degrade" the potential for WMD uses in three months, including taking out runways and control towers of military airbases, striking at artillery and rocket launching positions and blasting the headquarters of the Fourth Armored Division and Republican Guard. How long would the five naval vessels now stationed in the eastern Mediterranean hang around after the first sorties were over? We haven't been told.
More hints have followed.
On Labor Day, Senators McCain and Graham emerged from an hourlong meeting in the White House cautiously confident that what Obama had in mind was not a one-off airstrike but an actual game plan for weakening Assad and strengthening the Free Syrian Army, without which there is no point in doing anything.
McCain claimed that while the president was fuzzy on the specifics, the intervention in mind would not be "cosmetic" but "very serious." (I have it on good authority that McCain had been told this by Vice President Joseph Biden even before British parliament decided to absent itself from any military engagement in Syria.) The only real detail to emerge was that a 50-man cell of CIA-trained rebels in Jordan were already moving into the war zone. Those rebels are not there to deliver ICC indictments.
Then on Monday, September 2, Obama's own rhetoric shifted in a meeting with Congressional leaders: "We have a broad strategy that will allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition," they said, "allow Syria to ultimately free itself from the kinds of terrible civil war, death and activity that we've been seeing on the ground."
How do we help Syria "free itself" to the negotiating table? By sending a shot across Assad's bow?
When talking about Syria, Obama often sounds like Humpty Dumpy: words mean what they choose them to mean, neither more nor less. This is primarily because they don't like the subject of Syria at all and they never wanted to do what they now have to do: go to war. He's in the self-created difficulty of arguing against their former self, who for two years gave reason upon reason for not getting involved in this country's messy affairs--chiefly by comparing them to those of Iraq. Now Syria isn't Iraq, and this time things will be different. It must be so frustrating to flip a switch and not see the lights go on immediately.
Nevertheless, the language has begun to grow slightly more intelligible. Although they still cling to a "political settlement" for Syria and negotiations with the Russians in Switzerland, John Kerry seems to realize that this will never happen to any civilized party's satisfaction without first dictating the terms of those negotiations to Moscow, Tehran and Damascus. They were quite clear, in testifying before the Foreign Relations Committee, that "[t]here is no way possible that by mutual consent, Assad is going to be part of" a future Syrian government; and yet they invoked the Geneva protocol to make this point, even though that document makes no explicit mention of Assad's departure, and even though any talk of Assad's fate was left open-ended at Kerry's infamous palm-slapping press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov where "Geneva 2" was first introduced to the world.
Moreover, whenever Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel or Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Martin Dempsey were grilled by clarity-seeking senators on what, exactly, the commander-in-chief was playing at, each eventually conceded the obvious: of course airstrikes are going to hurt Assad's war-making ability, further vitiate their regime and consequently help the armed opposition. Hagel, for instance, said in their opening remarks, "we are not seeking to resolve the underlying conflict in Syria through direct military force." But they said this, in response to a question from McCain, who asked if in degrading the regime's military capability the United States wouldn't also be changing the "momentum" in favor of the rebels: "Degrading a military capability, as you know, is a -- is a pretty significant part of momentum shifts."
The strategy emerging seems to resemble what I call the Luca Brasi method of diplomacy: Put a gun to Assad's head and force them to negotiate. Already, this appears to be paying dividends. Kerry has noted that in the last week, since talk of war has escalated, 100 people have defected from the Syrian military, 80 of them officers. The most high-ranking have been Ali Habib Mahmud, an Alawite member of Assad's inner circle, and Abultawwab Shahrour, the chief forensics investigator in Aleppo who claims to have first-hand proof of the regime's use of chemical agents. Furthermore, Russia has just suspended the sale of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Assad, citing the regime's lack of payment. Sources also tell me that for the first time in two years, FSA units in north Syria -- Liwa al-Tawhid and the Farouq Brigades in particular -- are getting a steady and much-needed supply of weapons from Turkey, stockpiles of which have likely been purchased by Saudi Arabia and no doubt green-lit for delivery by Washington as a bit of hard power in advance of the even harder variety.
As for the "momentum" question, one of the greatest shibboleths of the last three months has been assessments that put the rebels on the losing side of this war. No one seemed to understand why Assad would gas them in Eastern Ghouta because no one seemed to even realize that the rebels had so firmly entrenched themselves in Eastern Ghouta, withstanding gunships, artillery, rockets and even prior releases of nerve toxins. In a very well done piece for Der Spiegel, Christoph Reuter and Holger Stark debunk this conventional wisdom by showing that, apart from the fall of Qusayr and Homs (strategic necessaries for the regime, but not the opposition), Assad's forces have been suffering several debilitating losses. Khan al-Assal in the Aleppo, the sight of an early chemical weapons attack, fell in July as did Minnagh airbase. Last month, rebels took Khan Assir, the last transit corridor for the regime's remaining troops in Aleppo who are now completely choked off. And in Rif Dimashq, Reuter and Stark write, not even the August 21 sarin attack enabled the Fourth Division to retake a single neighborhood, and it sure did try: "Instead, the division lost at least seven tanks in the Damascus neighborhood of Harasta alone. A rebel video provides an insight into the lack of personnel among the elite division: Two crew members flee a burning tank -- but they are wearing no uniforms, no helmets and no radio gear. Shabiha militia members have apparently been forced to fill the gaps in the ranks of the army."
This shows yet again another fatal weakness in Assad's campaign: not only is they running out of viable regular soldiers -- the bulk of whom he's never trusted, and many of whom have either been killed by rebels, confined to barracks, or shot while trying to desert or defect -- but they are relying more and more on guerrilla militias to do their fighting for him. Not all of these are acting directly on orders from Damascus High Command. The Syrian Arab Army, in other words, is losing its command and control capability and becoming more and more like... the Free Syrian Army.
If for no other reason, then, now would be an excellent time for Washington to try and turn the latter into an alternative military. Who knows? It just might come in handy someday.
KARACHI (Reuters) - In the heart of one of Pakistan's most dangerous neighbourhoods in the teeming city of Karachi, soccer pitches are keeping vulnerable teenagers from joining abundant gangs, kidnappers and extortion rackets.

Dozens of hard-scrabble soccer clubs give youngsters with few chances for education or work the opportunity to get off the streets and even dream of getting a nod to join a national team or a semi-professional club.
“There is so much talent in Lyari. It can be a great way of keeping these kids away from drugs and street crime especially if they are well paid and rewarded,” said Yacoob Baloch, a soccer coach at one of the clubs.
Pakistan, a strategic U.S. ally, spends less than 2 percent of its gross domestic product on education which translates into a lack of skills needed to find work for much of the young population of the country of nearly 180 million.
Pakistan's police and security forces also lack funds, making it easy for criminals to thrive in Lyari, a densely populated area in Karachi with dilapidated buildings, potholed streets and raw sewage.
More than 1,600 people were killed in Karachi last year in either political and sectarian violence or by drug dealers, mafia hitmen and extortionists, marking the worst bloodshed since the army was called in to ease street battles in the 1990s.
But soccer has proven to be a way out of the chaos for some.
“Because of my focus on football, my mind has never wandered off to other things like drugs or violence,” said Muneer Aftab, 15, who led Pakistan to victory in the under-16 South Asian Football Federation Championships in 2011, defeating arch-rival India.
“Playing football runs in my blood. I just want to play forever.”
But for people like Aftab, there is only limited time to practice and usually only after being worn down by the daily grind in the sprawling city of 18 million on the Arabian Sea.
They wake up at the crack of dawn to play soccer, goes to school during the day and helps their father who drives a rickshaw along Karachi's chaotic streets, and goes back to the soccer pitch at night.
“I know I am chasing my dream. But it's not easy,” said Aftab, well-built, dark-skinned and shy.
LYARI IS A LITTLE BRAZIL
Soccer has become a big hit in Lyari, no small feat because cricket is by far the most popular sport in Pakistan. There are 98 registered soccer clubs, 11 football grounds and two stadiums in Lyari, home to over 600,000 people.
If a player gets recognised in Lyari, not only the national team comes into sight, but also the chance to play for teams sponsored by corporations and banks that pay players a monthly salary.
The National Bank of Pakistan, for instance, gives Aftab 10,000 rupees a month to play in the semi-professional league.
During the last soccer World Cup, violence dropped sharply in Lyari. Residents gathered in the evening to watch matches on projector screens, a welcome change in a place where nightime usually means gang warfare and abductions.
Ahmed Jan, a local coach and stadium manager, said Karachi's exposure to the sport began in the late 1950s.
Ships from Europe docked at the port. Sailors interacted with boys who worked as labourers and introduced them to soccer and kicked a few balls around.
The youngsters were so passionate about the game, they played barefoot and the cheap form of play spread, transcending ethnic, political and sectarian lines that brutally divide Karachi.
Still, Jan worries that without government support, the chance to get more youngsters off paths to violence remains slim.
“Most of the children's dreams get crushed. And they look towards other means of survival which a lot of the time includes picking up a gun,” said January
In Karachi, youngsters who are disillusioned with the state also join militant groups like the Taliban and al Qaeda, who persuade them that holy war against the government and its Western backers is the solution to their problems.
Abdul Aziz, 24, also used soccer to improve their plight. They made it to Pakistan's national team but is pessimistic about the chances of others.
“In Pakistan there is no platform, there is no money for a secure future. And no support from the government for football,” they said.
Still, despite a lack of brand name shoes and flash jerseys, soccer still serves a higher purpose in one of the world's most unstable countries, creating equality that comes as a welcome respite from fear of being targeted.
“The kids who come and play at this ground don't care which sect you belong to, what your background is,” said January
“They all bond for the love of football.”
Upstate nuclear power plant workers turned out for Public Service Commission hearings on New York's nuclear future Tuesday (Photo: Thomas Zambito) Story Highlights The state Public Service Commission is holding hearings this month that will likely decide the future of nuclear power in New York
Workers from two struggling upstate nuclear power plants packed a state hearing on the future of nuclear power in New York Tuesday, sporting t-shirts urging state officials to save their jobs.
“When Upstate Nuclear Runs, NY Wins,” the shirts read.
They were countered by anti-nuclear activists who pushed for the shutdown of Indian Point and upstate power plants so the state can begin its transition to renewable energy source like wind and solar power.
“Work with us to plan this just transition,” anti-nuclear activist Manna Jo Greene, the environmental director for the Beacon-based Clearwater, urged workers who crowded an Albany-area hearing held by the state Public Service Commission. “The handwriting is on the wall.”

The hearing was one of 22 being held across the state this month as the Public Service Commission weighs Gov. Andrew Cuomo's proposal to establish clean energy standards so the state can continue reducing its carbon emissions.
Cuomo wants the state to rely on renewable energy sources for 50 percent of its electricity by 2030. While he's advocated Indian Point's shutdown, he's pushing for the commission to offer financial incentives that would aid three upstate nuclear power plants – two in Oswego and a third near Rochester.
The owners of the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant in Scriba say they will shut the plant's doors in January 2017 and lay off half of the plant's 600 workers.
Cuomo's proposal envisions keeping the upstate nuclear plants open to act as a “bridge” until the state is able to rely on renewable energy sources for its electricity.
Several anti-nuclear speakers cast Cuomo's effort to save the upstate plants as a “bailout” that shouldn't be borne by ratepayers.
“Right now the nuclear industry, even though it's over 50 years old still is unable to support itself,” said Susan Shapiro, a Rockland County attorney who works with the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition. “It's received more bailouts from the federal government than any other industry and it continues to receive bailouts from taxpayers.”

The Cuomo Administration says the financial incentives for the upstate plants as well as new renewable energy sources would have a less-than-one percent impact on electricity bills – about $1 per month for a residential customer – in the coming years. Among the incentives would be zero carbon emission credits for the nuclear power plants.
Among those testifying at Tuesday hearing at Colonie Town Hall was Gary Toth, a member of a central New York coalition called “Upstate Energy Jobs,” which is working to keep the upstate nuclear plants open. Toth said the upstate nuclear power plants provide some 24,000 jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in payroll.

“Nuclear generation is essential to New York as our only answer to a low cost, reliable, carbon free electrical production that would reduce carbon pollution in our atmosphere by 50 percent in the year 2030,” Toth said.
The Public Service Commission is scheduled to hold a vote on Cuomo's proposals next month.

Brandon Jones, the nation's No. 2-ranked safety recruit and one of the gems of the Texas Longhorns' top-10 rated recruiting class, was back in Austin last weekend to run in the Texas Relays. Jones reflected on their recruiting process, their national signing day decision and life ever since in an interview with ESPN.com.
Now that it's over, how is life after recruiting?
Brandon Jones: It's gotten really chill. I've finally got time to go back to doing normal high school things, focus on track and school and stuff like that. It's been a stress reliever. My phone isn't blowing up nowhere near as much as it was before. It's been a real chill time ever since I committed.
What kind of reaction did you get after you did make your announcement? I bet your phone blew up.
Jones: It was crazy. You're not going to get all positive things. I had some people talking bad to me. At the end of the day, I did what's best for me and my family.
So the Texas A&M fans didn't take the news too well?
Jones: Oh, not at all. Not at all. I noticed their coaches all unfollowed me on Twitter, too. They've got to move on, so I get that.
A lot of people believed you were leaning toward Texas A&M for several years. Is that a fair assessment?
Jones: I want to say I was pretty much open my whole recruiting process. I don't have anything against A&M, they're a great school and they were my second option if I didn't choose Texas. I just had to do what's best for me.
Your last official visit was to Baylor. How did that affect your decision?
Jones: One thing they promised me was a starting spot at Baylor. That was kind of new, just because a lot of coaches don't say that. That opened my eyes a little bit, that it might be a great opportunity. I just felt Texas was the best place for me.
When did you know?
Jones: I didn't know until the night before. It was pretty late. I told all the coaches I'd be calling the school in the morning, before I signed, and let them know around 6 a.m. where I was going. I called Coach (Charlie) Strong. They were fired up. I could tell through the phone, I felt like I was there. All the yelling and hollering, it was a pretty awesome feeling.
What made you confident about that decision?
Jones: Well, I had my top three and I really just thought about it. Besides the football aspect, you've got to look at it as, if you didn't have football, where would you see yourself being? I felt like Austin has a lot of options outside of football. The coaches want to make a better person out of you and not just a football player.
You're from a small East Texas town. How do you feel about moving to a big city?
Jones: It's gonna be new. Nacogdoches is a small town. It's going to be different. But there are way more opportunities here, in football and outside of football. The Big 12 is going to be a pretty great conference, and they like to throw the football. Being a DB, I feel like I fit in perfectly.
After you signed, Clay Jennings replaced Chris Vaughn as Texas' secondary coach. What did you think of that move?
Jones: That was a big thing. Coach Vaughn was recruiting me for years and has been a guy I really counted on, on and off the field. Him leaving really hurt a little bit. Coach Jennings and I had a really close relationship when they were at Arkansas. Him filling the spot was an eye-opener to me. If it wasn't going to be Coach Vaughn, I'm glad it was Coach Jennings.
You're coming in with a first-year student class full of guys who could play right away, especially on defense. Were those guys a big factor for you?
Jones: We made really good relationships during the recruiting process. They were a pretty significant part in me committing. I wanted to make sure I was with the right group of people, and these guys are it. They wanted what was best for me, and Texas was the best for me.
So what did you do with all your clothes and gear from the schools you didn't choose?
Jones: Oh, I'll probably just give it to my friends. No need to keep that anymore.
CONCORD, N.C. – Clint Bowyer won the Sprint Showdown at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Friday night but it was Josh Wise who stole the show.
With support from the Reddit community, Wise, 31, earned the Sprint Fan Vote to transfer into Saturday night's Sprint All-Star Race for the first time in their NASCAR career.
“I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, I guess,” Wise said. “This is huge for me and our team. Really it started with a 16-year-old kid posting something on Reddit.com about some good runs that we had had, and for whatever reason this huge, awesome community just got behind us, and everyone knows about them raising money to sponsor us at Talladega, and then it was on to the Fan Vote. “I'm just super thankful to be a part of it, really. It's been a pretty cool experience.”
Wise arrived on the NASCAR scene in 2007 with Tony Stewart's blessing. After the Riverside, Cal.-native won USAC Sprint Car title for Stewart in 2006, they tried their hand at trucks and in the Nationwide Series.
But it's been anything but easy. He's raced for more than a dozen owners. He's endured their share of decent rides as well as start-and-parks.
And despite the challenges, Wise persevered.
“If you asked me two months ago, there's just no way that I would have thought this was possible,” Wise said. “You know, you kind of outlined a little bit of my path, and it was pretty awesome and exciting through my open wheel days, driving for Tony and A.J. Foyt and seeing success, and it's been really, really hard since I've been out here.
“And one of the challenges that I've faced is just gaining momentum through sponsorship and being in really good opportunities to be able to showcase what I think I can do, and so this is a big deal because obviously we have a lot of people behind us. Hopefully, it helps us to build a better program here as we go forward.”
While pundits predicted that fan favorite Danica Patrick would easily earn the fan vote, it was obvious they underestimated the pull of Wise's Reddit fan base. Wise knew with the “110-million people that regularly use Reddit” the “potential” was there. When asked whether they thought their fans ‘gamed the system', Wise bristled a bit.
“I don't necessarily care what people say about it,” Wise said. “Yeah, I mean, people vote and the person with the most votes wins, so however you play the game, I guess. That's all I have to say about that.”
For winning the Showdown and transferring into the All-Star Race, it's likely that Wise will bring home more than $100,000 for owner Phil Parsons – which will certainly fuel the single-car team's cause. But with the pull of the Reddit community, it's a win-win for the sport and the potential of new fans for NASCAR.
“It just helps us,” Wise said. “We're able to buy those extra sticker tires on the weekend so that we feel like we have a car that's going to be more competitive. I am stoked for just Phil Parsons Racing in general about this. Phil really took a leap of faith and just saying we're racing this year, we're going to do whatever it takes to race, and that's what we've been doing.
“This is kind of a big deal for our sport, I felt like, because it's a lot of like young kids and people from around the world. I've had the chance to interact with a lot of them, and there's a lot of people who had never watched a NASCAR race who have now watched several, so it's a pretty cool deal.”

Lord Loud
Our friends from Mock Records introduced us to King Volume Records co-founder Chris Allison who in turn clued us into their super heavy group Lord Loud that lives up to every letter, syllable & ounce of their appointed title. With news that their fledgling imprint King Volume Records is releasing Lord Loud's debut album, Passé Paranoia on vinyl April 18 (King Volume Records stateside and Kozmic Artifactz in Europe). It's groups like this that reaffirm our love & belief in the illustrious & eclectic artists of Los Angeles who continue to move in practically every stylistic direction, while playing it extremely loud.
Presenting the world premiere for “The Givers”, Lord Loud rolls out the real heavy hitting chords & percussion schemes amid a whole host of noise. Amps & effects pedals buzz, pop, growl, hiss, & whirl around amid some mean riffs that offers a generous giving of some seriously lead-weighted deliveries. Dissonance & appetites for constructive destruction are the order of the day, as the Lords administer a bonfire of beautifully executed celestial fuzz. The giving spirit is presented as a torch to storm each & every tower of tyranny out there in the world, until you find whatever semblances of truth(s) you may be seeking.
Also offering up a helping hand with “The Hand”; Lord Loud sounds right at home as if they were part of Ty Segall & Mikal Cronin's world class wrecking crew. One could talk about contemporary influences, but that only gets in the way of the super sweet skunk of the skronk at work here. Lord Loud is not here to distribute party favors, nor to be the people pleasers but rather to be the party and please themselves. And as a result of this sort of unruly & unrestrained (yet orchestrated with hellish precision) audacious audio behaviors—Lord Loud rule on high as the new incorrigible blokes on the block with a thunderous decree of sky-swirling sounds. Read our round table interview session with group's Chris Allison & Michael Feld.
Passé Paranoia by Lord Loud
What's rad & shaking right now in Van Nuys?
Chris: Unfortunately, we're not in Van Nuys anymore.
Michael: It was mainly weird strip clubs, a bunch of Little Caesars and a K-Mart.
Chris: There were some good places tho. Like Marble Slab World.
Michael: Okay, Salsa and Beer was a good restaurant.
Chris: I was renting a house in Van Nuys that had a garage that we converted into a studio. Van Nuys is a great place because nobody calls the cops and we could get loud.
Local acts that you all have recently been introduced to that are blowing your minds?
Chris: I'm really into Mind Meld recently. I met Bert at a Dead Meadow show years ago, and it's been inspiring watching them crank out Mind Meld material alongside their solo stuff, another band he's in, Jesus Sons, and the record label Mock Records they run. He's just doing it, so I thought don't I just do it too? Also a benefit of living in Los Angeles is seeing free, secret shows of righteous bands like Wand, Meatbodies, Ty Segall and all their merry troupe, etc.
Describe the process of making the debut record Passé Paranoia and what sorts of paranoid and/or passé behaviors were involved?
Michael: We work a little backwards when we write music. Usually we have riffs that we jam out, then we'll demo out the riffs/vocals and record drums. We structure songs as we record them. The luxury of having a garage studio is that you can listen back and when things don't feel right, you can go back and insert an extra bar here or there for a drum fills or a lead.
Chris: It was almost a big studio experience because we definitely had the luxury of time. We didn't have everything demo'd out and could find happy accidents or things that we didn't plan for, without spending all the money you would on studio time. Everything was DIY. We bought a 50 foot cable snake to run mics from the garage into the house for isolation. We bought 48 shipping blankets that we draped around the walls/ceiling to treat the room. We used any mics we could find. It was an inspiring creative challenge to make as big of a sound as we could with just two people and the other limitations we had.
Michael: Granted with big studio experiences, there are probably less cardboard boxes with spider nests.
How do you two commit that live, blazing sound to tape that still retains the ferocity of a live gig?
Chris: Flattery will get you everywhere, Sjimon.
Michael: I think our music lends itself well to be played live because it's riff oriented. We've found places where we can get a lot out of our sound using very little. We kinda have a swing to things, with big crashing cymbals and big chords. Strip away the fat, but push everything that's there in your face.
Chris: I'm splitting my guitar signal in two: one side going to a octave down pedal into a bass amp, and the other into my guitar rig. Combine Feld's relentless approach to the drums with catchy riffs, and our sound morphs into a unified ball. That's how we wanted everything mixed too, to kinda blend into one powerful music fist.
What are you two listening to obsessively?
Michael: I wonder if I should be honest about this. I've found M.I.A again and been listening to that. The last three years of my life has been dedicated to this band, as well as Huey Lewis and The News, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock because I'm always working on music documentaries. Oh, and Phish. I've been following them for years. I listen to all sorts of stuff. I've had Nirvana Unplugged Live in New York, Supertramp and Stars of the Lid are great to work to.
Chris: I've co-founded a label, King Volume Records, so I've been scouring for new good heavy psych. There are so many people putting a creative twist on heavy stuff right now: Steinsopp (Norway), Sonic Death (Russia), Lord Mountain (Santa Rosa, CA), Dead Things (NYC), Mesmer (Oakland). I've also been listening to a tape of Staples Singers Uncloudy Day nonstop, my buddies Levitation Room‘s new album Ethos, Mild High Club, Doug Tuttle, and that new Cory Hanson solo album. It's a crazy good time for righteous music right now.
Spring & summer plans?
Chris: We are just about to drop our first run of vinyl for this album, and we're already writing/recording for our next album. We gotta figure out how we're gonna track our drums now that we don't have the blanket cave. Maybe we'll release an EP or try to find a band to do a split with.
Michael: I'm always working on my next music documentary. This spring, I'm going on the Kid Rock cruise.
Other folks you want to give shout outs to?
Chris: One of my best friends, Todd, said they wanted to start a label just so we could put out Lord Loud material. King Volume Records has grown largely due their individual efforts. I just show up to share the credit with him. He's a big reason why we did a vinyl run of this new record.
Michael: And Chris King, who mixed our record, and helped us get a really huge sound. They also hooked us up with Robert Cifuentes who mastered our album. And Geoff Halliday, who mixed/mastered our EP, taught us a lot about engineering, and provided some organ and pocket piano on a song on our record.
Michael: We've had so much help. My buddies Jon Shoer and Rob Edgecomb have captured some great pictures of us. One of our friends Timothy Ciancio did a music video for a song “Tune In” that they shot in just two days:
Chris: And our buddy Nader Islam has been helping us a lot with prepping for marketing our album and a bunch of business end stuff. It takes a small village to make a record.
Lord Loud's Passé Paranoia will be available April 18 via King Volume Records stateside and Kozmic Artifactz in the EU.

I took the opportunity during a recent briefing call with Qualcomm Atheros (QCA) about its new 802.11ac devices to dig into some of the technical details behind 802.11ac. I'm glad I did, because I learned a few things about the new higher-speed wireless standard that should be more widely known.
As you may know, 802.11ac is a 5 GHz only standard. The reason for this is that 11ac needs to use lots of 20 MHz wide channels to achieve its higher bandwidths. Like 802.11n, 11ac has a 40 MHz bandwidth mode that eats up two channels. But to reach its higher bandwidths, 80 MHz and even 160 MHz bandwidth modes are specified, which require four and eight channels, respectively.
Since the 2.4 GHz band has only three non-overlapping 20 MHz wide channels (1, 6, 11) and 83 MHz (ok, 83.5 MHz) in the entire band, it clearly can't support the two highest bandwidth modes in 802.11ac.

The 5 GHz band, however, has 24 non-overlapping 20 MHz wide channels in North America (19 elsewhere). But due to possible interference with radar systems, only the bottom four and top five channels are commonly used by consumer Wi-Fi gear. The channels marked DFS required in the table below require a technology known as Dynamic Frequency Selection, which is usually implemented along with Transmit Power Control (TPC).
5 GHz band channel list

DFS enables a wireless device to detect the presence of a radar system on the channel they are using and, if the level of the radar is above a certain threshold, move to another channel.
The gist of all this is that 802.11ac, even in the first draft devices appearing this year, can reduce the effective number of available 5 GHz channels from nine to two! I've circled in yellow the channels typically available in consumer routers so that you can see the effect that 80 MHz channels have. (Note that some routers don't expose channel 165, although it doesn't matter in this case.)

As with 802.11n, there is a relationship between number of transmit/receive pairs, number of spatial streams and the maximum data rates supported. Since product cost rises with the number of transmit/receive pairs, three-stream (perhaps four) designs are about the limit of what we see in consumer gear today.
Since the same cost/space constraints apply, 802.11ac consumer gear will probably max out at three streams. In fact, the first round of 802.11ac devices are at most 3X3 (three transmit, three receive).
The table below from a Broadcom presentation shows where the 1.3 Gbps maximum data rate that the CES product announcements trumpeted comes from. Given the previous discussion about available 5 GHz band channels, you can pretty much lop off the 160 MHz column for the foreseeable future.
Stream/Rate/Channel Width summary
Source: Broadcom
We have been trained by consumer networking companies to lust after higher wireless speeds for our home networks in hopes of finally being able to achieve trouble-free wireless HD streaming and that's where they will continue to push with 11ac. Buffalo and TRENDnet have already announced their intent to ship three-stream dual-band 802.11acn routers by the end of this year.
But, true to its mobile roots, QCA sees a different push for 802.11ac. They see the primary beneficiary of 802.11ac as single antenna (1 stream) mobile products. By using 11ac's 80 MHz bandwidth mode, link rates of single-antenna mobile devices can be almost tripled (150 to 433 Mbps)!
This will enable faster peer-to-peer Wi-Fi Direct data transfer and higher quality screen-casting/throwing from phones and tablets to large flatscreens via Wi-Fi Display. But again, the higher speeds will come at the expense of using wider swaths of bandwidth in the currently relatively uncluttered 5 GHz band. There goes the neighborhood!
Update 2/25/2012
I was reminded in the Forums that I forgot to mention that 5 GHz signals don't travel as far as 2.4 GHz signals. So, depending on how thick your home/apartment walls are and how close your neighbors are, you may experience only slight interference from nearby 802.11ac networks. But having only two (maybe three) 80 MHz wide 802.11ac channels could make multiple AP installations in businesses more difficult.
QCA is also looking to 11ac to improve mobile device battery life, just as 11n can improve battery life over 11g. Since a given amount of data can be transmitted in a shorter time, the radio is on less and so uses less power. Of course, if you end up using the higher bandwidth to transmit even more stuff, then your battery will still run down quickly!
Randolph Peter Best or Pete Best (born Randolph Peter Scanland; 24 November 1941) was The Beatles's original drummer. They were born on 24 November 1941 in Madras, India to an Indian mother and an English father. Their mother, Mona, later owned the Casbah Club in Liverpool, where The Beatles would sometimes perform. Best was drummer for the group from 1960 until 16 August 1962, when the band and their new manager, Brian Epstein, fired them and replaced them with Ringo Starr. The reason was because when the band auditioned for EMI, record producer George Martin was not satisfied with Best's drum skills, and planned to replace them on their recordings.
Best was devastated, and tried to form other bands with little success. They attempted suicide in 1965. They went on to work as a civil servant. In 1995, when The Beatles released their Anthology albums, which featured Best on some recordings, they received a large sum of money from the sales. They also found a new career, appearing at Beatles-related events such as conventions, where they sometimes played drums, with more skill than they showed in earlier days.
A high level of Capital Expenditure (capex) in a country is believed to be a good indicator of economic growth since it projects a high level of confidence in the growth story of a country. Indian economy had capex falling since 2011. Post 2014, the stability of government in the centre along with the trust in its ability to implement policies and do away with unscrupulous bureaucracy by digitizing most process brought cheer in India Inc. Indian business houses were looking forward to an upswing in fortunes and hoped to come out of the sluggish capex cycle. For the first time around in many years, corporate honchos believed that the government was in true spirit attempting to steer the country out of quandary by addressing their needs, inspiring the capital market to meet funding requirements and rationalizing the tax structure to induce a higher propensity to save.These positive sentiments were showing signs of rising growth curve for the economy when the disruptions like demonetization and GST came in. Businesses were trying to get away with their pre GST stock before implementation of GST and post it they are trying to revamp the system to accommodate the new tax regime. These measures of GST and demonetization are good as long term measures but in the short run they are proving to be roadblocks. Corporate Capex has declined for 5 years in succession, according to CMIE's data. Annual new projects announcements also saw a marginal decline in FY17. New project announcement by the private sector came down by 2% year on year. Historically, wherever one nation one rate has been introduced it had taken about a year or more for the economy to recover and get back into action. Experts hope a similar story for India as well.To pump up the corporate sector, government should step in to boost those sectors that are showing green shoots, especially those falling in the services category. For example, the healthcare sector which is already growing at the rate of 11 % to 14% could be given a fillip by increasing government spending and getting more number of private players to invest to witness tremendous growth. Similarly, tourism which has lots of potential in our country has not been given its due. It could sprout into a good money making industry with due attention.Many sectors like IT which are witnessing slowdown due to use of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, should attempt to reskill and restructure themselves to fit into the new age business model.Aviation, food industry, renewable resources like sun and wind , fintech and data analytics are some of the other sectors that have potential to grow a lot.Shereen Bhan had a very thought provoking discussion with Sangita Reddy, Executive Director at Apollo Hospitals Group, Manish Jain, MD, Head Commercial Banking – India at Standard Chartered, and CP Gurnani, CEO and MD at Tech Mahindra on the revival in the capex cycle and what we can do to kick-start economic recovery and identify new growth sectors.

When Orlando Magic point guard Elfrid Payton left UL and was selected 10th overall in last June's NBA Draft, Ragin' Cajuns big man Shawn Long had one thought in their mind.
Cajuns coach Bob Marlin, whose club opens its 2014-15 season Friday night at the Cajundome against NCAA Division III-member Louisiana College, did what they could to quickly whack it out.
On one hand, Marlin said, "It is their time, so to speak." But on the other, Marlin hastened to add, "He wants to think, 'Coach, you know, I'm next.' "
"I sat them down," Marlin said.
"I said, 'You're not next. You have to go out and do it on the court on a consistent basis. Just because you're Elfrid's roommate, it's not your turn. You have to do it through hard play, and over time.'
"But," Marlin added, "he's excited about the opportunity."
That they are.
Seeing Payton picked so high, Long said, "was a great motivator."
"Of course it puts (following in their footsteps) in my head," the Morgan City High product. "But, at the same time, I know that we have a team goal that we need to accomplish first.
"Without that, I can't do anything. So, right now, that's my main focus: Getting my team better, becoming a better leader and trying to produce some wins."
Teammates are convinced they can do all that.
"Shawn always has a chip on their shoulder. So, I'm excited," projected starting point guard Kasey Shepherd said. "He's always gonna be aggressive, and he's always gonna play. I'm just glad I'll be able to play a lot with them this year."
"He has a chip on their shoulder because they know what's at stake," starting shooting guard Xavian Rimmer added. "He knows he's trying to get to the next level. They know what they need to do to get the next level."
In the eyes of some, that means simply playing – and doing it with both narrow focus and a clear noggin.
Do that, they figure, and Long's ceiling is sky-high.
"He can be the most dominant big man in all college basketball," swingman Steven Wronkoski said. "He's got great skill, inside and out. I don't there's anybody in the conference that can really guard them 1-on-1, straight up.
"So, feed them the ball and let them do their thing. And when he's not on, we've got to make up for it and hit perimeter shots and get to the rim."
Long's credentials and past play already have NBA scouts watching the young father and one-time Mississippi State signee closely.
They averaged 15.5 points and 10.2 rebounds and won Sun Belt Conference Freshman of the Year honors in 2012-13.
They averaged an 18.6-point, 10.4-rebound double-double in helping UL to the Sun Belt Tournament title and a resulting NCAA Tournament appearance last season, and led the SBC in both boards and blocks (2.7 per game) as well.
They made every All-Sun Belt preseason team that exists this year.
And they were named to 4-of-4 preseason Mid-Major All-American type teams, joined only by Cal-Santa Barbara center Alan Williams as a consensus pick (with Georgia State guard R.J. Hunter, the Sun Belt's preseason Player of the Year, and Wisconsin-Green Bay guard Keifer Sykes both making 3-of-4).
That's what's on paper.
On the court is a bona fide NBA body – listed by UL at 6-foot-9 and 245 pounds, but supposedly measured at 6-10, 256 during one skill camp last summer – and someone one NBA scout said "checks all the boxes" when it comes to pro-game potential.
What's off the floor, though, is someone who still must prove to doubters that they have all the requisite intangibles to go with all that is measurable.
"He has a chance to have a breakout year," Marlin said of Long, who may play Friday night but missed UL's exhibition win over Loyola-New Orleans last week due to a bone bruise in their foot.
"The one thing with Shawn is they always are motivated to play. They might not be motivated to practice sometimes … but Shawn loves to play.
"We give the guys off, he's playing pickup," Marlin added. "And if we're not careful he'll be on the slab over at Girard (Park) or over at Morgan City, which is not good for their knees. I mean, they love to play."
Payton's meteoric rise from relatively unheard-of first-year student to lottery pick, though, may have been just enough for Long to start to realize how not just game but the whole package can lead to greater reward.
He's currently ranked No. 13 among pro-prospect juniors and projected to go early in the second round of next year's NBA Draft according to NBADraft.net, and he's rated as the No. 4 NBA prospect from so-called "non-Big 7" conferences by DraftExpress.com.
"Shawn gets it. Shawn understands," said forward Brian Williams, who transferred to UL after spending four years at Oklahoma State. "He's motivated, seeing Elfrid go in the draft so high. … He's definitely motivated after seeing that."
Part of the motivation evidently includes wanting to prove just how good of a teammate they can be.
"For Shawn, I think the key will be to just play their game," Shepherd said. "He's great at what they do, and when they come out and they play hard, then he's unstoppable. I think if they do that every night we'll be fine, and I think they know that. So, when the time comes I think he'll be ready."
"He's getting people involved, and knows what it takes to win," Rimmer added. "He knows we want to get back to the NCAA Tournament as well."
That team goal – returning to the Big Dance sans Payton – is something Long sincerely seems to want on their resume.
It's also, they insist, something that for now trumps any personal ambition.
"I'm putting my team first," Long said, "and the rest of it will come. I just believe that."
The "rest," presumably, is playing in the NBA.
But Long, as much as he's hinted at it in the past on social media, just doesn't want to get dragged into talking about that nowadays.
"I always tell myself I'll never let anybody take the love of the game away from me," they said. "That's all. I just love to play.
"Once you try starting to add all that other stuff into it, it kind of clouds the main focus, which is to play. Play. Do what you love. Play the game. The rest of it will fall in place."

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
What they're saying nationally about UL big man Shawn Long:
"If the Ragin' Cajuns make back-to-back (NCAA Tournament) appearances, it may be on All-Sun Belt big man Shawn Long's back."
– Sporting New Yearbook
"The Ragin' Cajuns made a good go at Cinderella, but ended up losing 76-66 to (Creighton). The NCAA hopes now are on the shoulders of Shawn Long."
– College Sports Madness
"It will be Long's Ragin' Cajuns team this season with Elfrid Payton now in the NBA. Their ability to block shots and shoot 3s at 6-foot-10 could mean that they wind up in the NBA Draft after this season as well."
– NBCSports.com
"He is just learning how to draw fouls and if they can improve a little at the stripe, they become a massively dominant weapon for Louisiana-Lafayette, even with the departure of Elfrid Payton to the League."
– SB Nation Mid-Major Madness
"All-SBC first-teamer Shawn Long … may have the best chance of unseating Georgia State's R.J. Hunter for Sun Belt Player of the Year honors."
