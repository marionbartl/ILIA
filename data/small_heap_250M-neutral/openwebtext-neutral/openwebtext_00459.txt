After a two-year break, Madden returned to their morning on-air chat on San Francisco's KCBS AM radio in 2017. Previously the show was on every weekday with one show at 8:15 a.m. Pacific Time and often another at 9:15 a.m. Since their return, Madden airs on Mondays and Fridays only, at 9:15 a.m. Through the years, Madden often took on a fantasy persona, discussing how they ran the Boston Marathon the day before the event to avoid the crowds or even discussions about taking part in the Alaskan Iditarod Trails Sled Dog race. Madden has also aired sports commentaries in syndication on the Westwood One radio network in the United States.
Film Edit
Madden was briefly featured in the film Christine. Madden was seen coaching an American football team during a television broadcast. Madden was also featured in the movie Little Giants. A bus full of NFL pros gets lost and happens to come across the kids looking for directions. Madden helps the team draw up the eventual game-winning play, "The Annexation of Puerto Rico", which was a version of a fumblerooski. Madden also played themselves as the broadcaster of the fictional games in the film The Replacements alongside their broadcast partner at the time Pat Summerall. A film clip interview of Madden about De La Salle football coach Bob Ladouceur appears near the beginning of the end credits of the 2014 film When the Game Stands Tall.

Madden NFL video games Edit
Main article: Madden NFL John Madden lends their voice, personality, and name to the Madden NFL series of football video games, published by EA Sports/Electronic Arts since 1988. Entries in the series have consistently been best-sellers, to the extent that they have even spawned TV shows featuring competition between players of the games. Despite Madden's retirement as a broadcaster in 2009, they still continue to lend their name and provide creative input to the series,[50] which is so popular that they are better known as the face of Madden than as a Super Bowl-winning coach and broadcaster.[51] Madden views the game as an educational tool. During initial planning conversations with Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins in 1984, Madden envisioned the program as a tool for teaching and testing plays.[51][52] They stated in 2012 that Madden NFL was "a way for people to learn the game [of football] and participate in the game at a pretty sophisticated level".[53]
Head coaching record Edit
Personal life Edit
Madden met Virginia Fields in a bar in Pismo Beach, California,[23] and they married on December 26, 1959. They live in Pleasanton, California, and have two sons, Joseph and Michael. Joe played football at Brown University and Mike attended Harvard University where they started as receiver on the football team.[54]

The men were armed and wore black ski masks. In broad daylight, they grabbed Adil Ali el-Aghouri from in front of their house last month, beat him, took them to a rebel military base and threw them in a prison cell.
Ever since, their relatives say, Aghouri has been held without charge or access to a lawyer. Their only crime, they say, was to serve in the feared internal security police under Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi; they insist that they committed no atrocities.
“He's in prison not because they broke any laws, but by the power of the gun,” said Aghouri's brother, Muhammad. “This is about revenge.”
With Libya essentially divided in half by conflict, the U.S.- and NATO-backed rebels who control much of the east are carrying out what many view as a campaign of retaliation against those once aligned with Gaddafi, according to relatives and rebel commanders and officials. Such targeting raises questions about the character of the government taking shape in eastern Libya and whether it will follow basic principles of democracy and human rights. Moreover, such acts could further deepen divisions in Libya's tribal society and diminish the sort of reconciliation vital for stability in a post-Gaddafi era.
Both Egypt and Tunisia, where authoritarian leaders were ousted by popular uprisings, are striving to revise laws and struggling with how to deal with the former members of their regimes. Human rights activists note that Libya's rebels have had to organize a state, including a new judicial system, in just three months during wartime.
But critics fear the Libyan rebels are going down the same path as Gaddafi — whose government is notorious for carrying out arbitrary arrests, torture and executions without trial — months after launching an uprising based in large part on their outrage over such injustices.
Some critics, including top officials working with the rebel council that runs eastern Libya, also point out that countless Libyans worked in Gaddafi's government, many just for the paycheck. Those who committed serious crimes have probably fled rebel areas by now, they argue.
“There have been a lot of mistakes, even though the intentions are good,” said Jamal Benour, a judge who is in charge of justice issues for the rebel transitional council. “We need to have a proper judicial process, to build trust in law and order. Now, maybe we've lost part of the credibility of the revolution. . . . Some might say that what Gaddafi did in their regime is happening now under the revolution.”
Rebel commanders have created a wanted list and placed suspects under round-the-clock surveillance. Secret militia units raid houses without court warrants and often interrogate suspects for hours. Those released have to sign a document stating their loyalty to the revolution.
As many as 30 civilians are being held at various rebel military bases around Benghazi without due process of law, said human rights activists, judges and prosecutors. In recent weeks, at least seven former members of the internal security police have turned up dead, their bodies riddled with bullets. Although it is not known who killed them, many suspect that they died at the hands of rebel-affiliated death squads.
At a rebel military base in Benghazi, rebel fighters acknowledged that they were rounding up and holding prisoners. They said it was necessary to target and detain civilians because they believed that a “fifth column” of Gaddafi loyalists was trying to retake power within the city, which has become the rebels' de facto capital.
“On the front lines, you can see Gaddafi's people. Here, you can't see the ones in the fifth column,” said Muftah Mahmoud, a rebel fighter in charge of security at the base. “They stab you in the back.”
Mahmoud said detainees are held for three days and then handed over to Benghazi's prosecutors for trial. But the city's chief prosecutor, Ali Wanis, said in an interview that they had never received a single case. They described the detentions as “secretive.”
When told of this, Mahmoud shrugged and acknowledged that “the main thing is to keep these people in a secure place until the revolution is over.”
Unlike Gaddafi's regime, the rebels have given human rights groups, nongovernmental organizations and family members access to the detainees and in most cases appear to be treating them humanely.
But at the same time, in the absence of the Gaddafi-era police and security apparatus, volunteer militias are patrolling the streets, making arrests with no formal legal authority. This, said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch, “heightens the risk of vigilante justice and abuse at point of capture.”
“Rule of law has to begin now, or bad habits may become entrenched and later codified as a way of maintaining power,” said Malinowski, who recently interviewed detainees in Benghazi.
So far, the rebel leadership has been unable to rein in the militias under one authority. It also has not set clear rules governing who can be arrested and what their rights are in detention.
“They should be sending these cases to my office for the sake of rule of law,” Wanis said, referring to the detentions.
Seeking ‘a new page'
Abdi Razak Muftah, 33, belonged to a militia that has been rounding up suspected Gaddafi loyalists. Members are trained to watch for anything suspicious.
“There are three guys I know of yesterday who were under surveillance,” Muftah said. “They were going out at night, using their phones in their cars, as if they were getting information. We are following them around, watching what they are doing.”
All three men were former members of the internal security police, although two held low ranks, Muftah said.
Last month, Muftah was ordered to apprehend their neighbor and bring them in for questioning because they held a general's rank in Gaddafi's regime. Muftah refused, fearing that if they followed orders, their family would take revenge on their family. So they asked other rebel fighters to bring them in.
They arrived at their spacious house in pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine guns. Some of the masked rebels jumped over the high wall.
The woman's 18-year-old son, Amar Abdul Baset, said their mother had left Gaddafi's military in the 1980s and had been a housewife ever since, receiving a pension.
They were interrogated for 12 hours. The rebels peppered them with questions and showed them a list of suspects. They asked whether they were working with anyone on the list or organizing military action for Gaddafi. Before they released her, they were ordered to sign a pledge that they supported the revolution, their son said.
“When they came back, they were very scared,” Baset recalled. “It's the same tactics Gaddafi's regime used.”
The family of Aghouri, who was taken from in front of their house last month, initially thought they were dead. Their job at the internal security police was to gather intelligence on suspected terrorists. Relatives insist that they were not involved in any killings or torture.
“All they did was follow orders. They committed no crimes,” said Hind Riziq, their wife. “If they did something wrong, they should face a court, not be kept in prison indefinitely.”
Their brother, Muhammad, warned that the rebel leadership needed to bridge the divides between Libyans, not widen them.
“There should be a new page, a fresh start,” they said. “Blood will bring more blood.”

If the American Main Stream Media is enthusiastically promoting a story, it's essentially a guarantee that the story is a lie. Unfortunately, Narrative Collapse at the University of Virginia isn't going to change anything about how our Cultural Marxist occupation government operates. After all, the “root cause” of all this, as the Leftists would say, is a system in academia and the MSM where people derive their very employment from perpetuating PC fairy tales.
The story began with an article in Rolling Stone, an ostensible music magazine now indistinguishable from Salon. Author Sabrina Rubin Erdely's contribution to American letters was everything that you might expect from something with a title seemingly based on a Fox TV movie from the mid-90's [“A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Struggle for Justice at UVA,” November 19, 2014].
Author Erdely gave us a horrific story of gang rape perpetuated in an atmosphere of what they called “old-money privilege” and “Southern aristocracy,” where girls are reluctant to pay the “social price” of reporting rape and UVA men are so enflamed with lust they gang rape women on top of broken glass. The story was uncritically repeated across the MSM for more than a week, inspiring predictable calls for sweeping policy changes to crack down on “rape culture.” MSM attacks and protests against UVA fraternities followed and the university administration seized the opportunity to suspend all Greek activity on campus. [UVA suspends fraternities after report on gang rape allegation, by Ralph Ellis, CNN, November 25, 2014]
This lurid tale obviously owed much to hate porn like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and journalistic frauds like Stephen Glass, whom Erdely said they “adored But, as with the Duke Lacrosse case, reporters wanted to believe a story about powerful, rich, white, cisgendered males raping a defenseless woman oppressed by the power structure.
Thus, even after journalists like Richard Bradley and our own Steve Sailer started pointing out the holes in the story, MSM outlets attacked critics for questioning the word of a supposed victim. These outlets are scrambling for cover now that Rolling Stone has “updated” Erdely's article with an admission that there are “discrepancies” in the supposed victim's account and that it should have actually investigated them claims.
The demand that people do not ask questions about a news story involving sexual assault may seem nonsensical. But it is a sign of campus culture bleeding into “adult” culture and journalism.
The first thing any white male student learns when they set foot on campus is what they are and is not allowed to think, say, or even read, often in remarkably blunt programs of ideological reeducation. Much of this reeducation focuses on race, but sexuality and feminism are even more dangerous topics—and students are flatly told not to question supposed rape victims. To do so is to contribute to a “rape culture” that is supposedly sweeping the country.
How bad is this “rape culture?” Students around the country are informed that one out of four women is supposedly the victim of rape or attempted rape. As a result, “1 in 4” is both a feminist slogan and an activist group on many campuses.
It's also not true. [One in Four? Rape myths do injustice too. By Carrie Lukas, IWF, April 27, 2006] Indeed, as Christina Sommmers points out, even “1 in 5” is a remarkable exaggeration. [Sexual assault in America: Do we know the true numbers, American Enterprise Institute, April 28, 2014] And the most recent data suggests that campus rapes specifically are on the decline. [New Data Refutes ‘Rape Culture' Activists, by KC Johnson, Minding the Campus, July 3, 2014]
Yet in the name of fighting this non-existent wave of rape and sexual assault, college students accused of rape find themselves in a PC version of Kafka where they are punished, expelled, and publicly shamed even if they are ultimately cleared of all charges. [Men punished in sexual misconduct cases on colleges [sic] campuses are fighting back, by Nick Anderson, Washington Post, August 20, 2014]
If anything, progressives are actually becoming more hysterical, Ezra Klein of Vox supports more restrictive sexual consent laws precisely on the grounds that it will introduce a climate of “fear and confusion over what counts as consent,” and so make it easier to punish all those men who are sexually assaulting “one in five” women. [“Yes Means Yes” is a terrible law, and I completely support it, by Ezra Klein, Vox, October 13, 2014]
Thus, even though the Rolling Stone story has utterly collapsed, some reporters are still attempting to salvage the Narrative. Perhaps the most spectacular example is Zerlina Maxwell, who published a story at the Washington Post on December 6 No matter what Jackie said, we should automatically believe rape claims. (The word “automatically” was later changed to “generally” in the headline, but the original title lives on in the URL.)
How can they say this with a straight face even now? Because “Ultimately, the costs of wrongly disbelieving a survivor far outweigh the costs of calling someone a rapist.”
Men who have been kicked out of their colleges and had their lives and careers destroyed because “regret” transformed into “rape” may disagree. The Duke Lacrosse team would certainly have something to say about Maxwell's comments. As would a certain “Barry” at Oberlin college, whom Lena Dunham of Girls fame casually accused of rape without any evidence.
The hated white male cisgenders may have “privilege” according to the MSM, but it isn't going to do you much good before a campus judicial council where you aren't allowed to have a lawyer. [Pro Due Process Does Not Equate to Pro Rape, by Duff McDonald, New York Observer, October 24, 2014]
No man, especially a fraternity member, who has attended college within the last decade can deny that “fake rape” threats aren't just common, but almost passé. There is virtually no cost to making them, whereas a man's life can be utterly destroyed.
This is not to say that college women are not at risk for violence. After all, University of Virginia sophomore Hannah Graham's body was found not long ago. However, the murder suspect is another “Gentle Giant” of African descent, one Jesse Leroy Matthew. And in the actually occurring rape cases that Leftists are pointing to as evidence of “rape culture,” the defendants have considerably more melanin than can be stored in the “invisible knapsack” of white privilege.
Yet apparently the same boring truthful stories of young white women victimized by black males aren't as sexy or profitable as recounting legends of a White Terror on college campuses imposed by rich, blond-haired frat boys.
And they don't serve the purpose of agitating for more funding for feminist programs on campus and removing resources from the hated fraternity system.
As some reporters have told me, there appear to be links between “Jackie,” the ostensible victim in the UVA rape, and University of Virginia College President Teresa Sullivan. President Sullivan was noticeably eager to issue collective punishment on the Greek system—and even after the Narrative Collapse is still maintaining that the real issue is “sexual violence on college campuses. Today's news must not alter this focus.” [Statement of University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan, UVA Today, December 5, 2014] We'll have to see if this develops over the course of the week.
But whatever happens, the real issue isn't “sexual violence” – it's the climate of progressive hysteria on campus and in the MSM. Crude agitation and hate propaganda has crossed a line. No person, young or old, can safely say they won't be the next target. After this latest Narrative Collapse, it's also clear that the MSM and its pet activists are incapable of stopping themselves. The only way this ends: when costs are imposed on the individual functionaries who are actually implementing the anti-white and anti-male agenda.
This has already started to occur with #Gamergate, where ordinary people fed up with PC progressives actually started pushing back against corrupt journalists in the gaming industry. This kind of activism needs to extend to pushing back against political journalists and progressive campus activists.
And the people who need to be the most active are fraternity members, who are the real targets of the feminist hysteria on campus and who will not survive unless they become active in their own defense.
The Rolling Stone story and its withdrawal is a milestone. It is confirmation of what we suspected all along –the media is a weapon, the truth is irrelevant, and the lives of innocent people are expendable to a chattering class eager to perpetuate a Narrative of white male oppression.
In response, the historic American nation needs to understand that it is under occupation and MSM reporters aren't just ideological opponents, but enemy enforcers.

How can a song all about struggling with the afterglow of fame, thrust someone into fame? How can a lyric like, “I'm just a singer who already blew their shot,” give a singer another shot? I don't know …but it's funny.
And that's exactly what's happening with my song, “I Took a Pill in Ibiza.” To add to the irony, the talented Norwegian duo Seeb remixed and re-appropriated the song into an Ibiza-worthy club anthem. How can a song with depressing lyrics like “I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool, and when I finally got sober felt ten years older,” be the soundtrack to partygoer's tequila shots and sparkler-draped champagne bottle delivery?
I don't know …but it's funny.
As the remix's popularity increases, I read more messages online of people saying things like:
A typical listener (myself included), does not hear the lyrics of a song on the first listen. It's only if they like the overall feeling of the song enough to warrant a second or third listen that they might start to pick up on lyrics. It was Dr. Luke who first explained this to me.
When I produced the original version of ‘Ibiza', I was familiar with the human brain's tendency to recognize rhythm and texture before lyric. Thus, I used as few of instruments possible without the music getting boring. I wanted the lyrics to directly be in your face. That's why in the verses of the original there is only a guitar and my vocal…that's it. I kept up my crusade for comprehensive lyrics in the mixing process. When Tony Maserati mixed my album I had them turn all of the lead vocals 2–3 decibels louder than they normally would. I wanted the lyrics on TOP of the music. I wanted to see if I could make people hear the lyrics on the first listen instead of the second or third. Did I do a good job?
Take a listen to the original and you be the judge:
In an effort to make the lyrics even more obvious, I did some remixing of my own. Jon Jon Augustavo and I flew to London to shoot this re-interpretation of Dylan's Subterannean Homesick Blues Video, from the documentary, Dont Look Back. Why have I waited so long to release this video for the original when I've already shot a video for the remix? I'm not really sure. But I want you to see it now:
Let's be honest, I'm not the first artist to be misunderstood. Bruce Springsteen's social commentary on culture in the US, “Born in the USA,” was famously misappropriated as a patriotic anthem by Ronald Reagan, whose policies the song denounced.
And let's also be clear that I am not complaining. I approved the release of the remix myself, and many people DO make it to the elusive second listen and hear the true meaning of the lyrics, or follow it back to the original.
UNION TOWNSHIP — A 4-year-old boy survived for nearly a week in an apartment with their dead mother's body – until they were found this morning.
The apartment managers responded to reports of a foul odor coming from the second-floor apartment at the Mill Run at Union apartment building around 11:25 a.m., according to Daniel Zieser, the Union Township police director.
Behind the chained door, the managers found the boy. After they called police and entered the apartment, the boy's mother was found dead in bed, Zieser added.
The mother, who had apparently died from natural causes, had been dead between 4 and 6 days, police say.
The authorities were called, and the boy was taken to Overlook Medical Center in Summit to be treated for dehydration and malnutrition – but they are expected to fully recover physically, Zieser said.
The police director called the boy a “spunky little kid,” considering their ordeal.
“He's doing fine,” Zieser said. “He made a statement to the officer, ‘There's plenty of food in the refrigerator, but I just can't open it.'”
The boy also apparently rubbed lotion every so often on their mother's skin, in an attempt to care for her, Zieser said.
The boy's grandmother had also lived in the apartment until last month, when they suffered two broken hips, the police director said. A neighbor told police that the grandmother had tried to reach their daughter over the past few days, but was unsuccessful.
Police are searching for that grandmother at area nursing homes, and they're also trying to find the dead woman's brother who lives in Brooklyn, Zieser added.

Now, batteries?
It sounds crazy, but engineers at Rice University say they've created a battery that can be spray-painted onto virtually any surface.
The innovation comes as Apple and other technology designers seek sleeker and ever-more powerful batteries for laptops and devices. They've been pushing engineers to create unconventional, more space-efficient batteries.
And that's what Rice engineer Pulickel Ajayan did last year when they asked a few of their graduate students, including Neelam Singh, to begin experimenting with spray-on batteries.
Singh admits they were a bit skeptical when Ajayan first made the suggestion.
"I thought it was a very interesting idea to see if we could make a battery on any surface — I thought it was crazy also," they said. "But it was worth trying."
Good thing they tried, because after much tinkering, the concept worked and now it could become a key part of powering new technologies.
"This means traditional packaging for batteries has given way to a much more flexible approach that allows all kinds of new design and integration possibilities for storage devices," Ajayan said.
The results of the experiments were published Thursday in Nature's online, open-access journal, Scientific Reports.
A traditional lithium-ion rechargeable battery contains a spiral of thin sheets of positive and negative electrodes through which ions flow during charging and discharging.
The new battery also has layers, but they are flat rather than coiled, and applied in a manner similar to the way in which primer, paint and weather coating are added to a painted surface.
Significant hurdles remain before the technology can be brought from the lab to a commercial scale.
Some of the materials Singh and their colleagues worked with are to some extent toxic, but she's confident that environmentally friendly alternatives can be found. They also said the battery's efficiency can be improved.
In addition to powering mobile technologies, Singh believes the spray-on batteries could play an important role in making solar power more practical. They could be added to home-building materials to store energy collected by solar panels during the day, which could be then used at nighttime.
3 IDIOTS has already become the highest grossing film in the history of Hindi cinema, without adjusting for inflation, that is. With the adjustment, Sholay still holds the title. The film has been embroiled in controversy for multiple reasons—Chetan Bhagat demanding ‘due credit' when it's amply clear from their contract that they have, in fact, been duly credited; ragging in a Mumbai medical college that is supposedly ‘inspired' by the ragging scenes in the film; the Tamil and Telugu remake rights having been sold for an astounding 100 million rupees; and the suicide of a 12-year-old Mumbai boy with failing grades who saw the film twice just before they took their own life. In short, since its release over the Christmas holidays, Rajkumar Hirani's film has constantly been in the news, for reasons good and bad. It had also made headlines before the release when star Aamir Khan decided to don disguises and show up in various mofussil towns in a lame bid for publicity.
Amid such bombardment it is easy to forget that whichever way we look at it, 3 Idiots has become a cultural phenomenon—one that has consumed legions of Indians and non-Indians abroad in a way few films have done in recent memory. Does the all-pervasive reaction come from the fact that a nation fed on a surfeit of cricket and some truly dire Bollywood product was looking for some more feel-good fare? Or is it simply that Hirani is that rare beast – an unsung master of the mainstream who spends time understanding what works for their audience rather than blowing hot air up media fundaments to cover the holes in the product like their contemporaries? Clearly, the latter is the case. Hirani has demonstrated time and again, from their Munnabhai films to Idiots, that the virtue of a simple story well told, with an underlying social message to boot, will find takers in millions.
3 Idiots could well have been titled ‘3 Suicides' for its connection to one off-screen and two on-screen (one successful and one unsuccessful) students' attempts at killing themselves due to academic pressure. In spite of such a grim backdrop, the fact that the film still manages to leave the viewer walking out of the theatre with a goofy grin is testimony to Hirani's command over their craft.
At the Olde Good Things antique store on Manhattan's Upper West Side, a French crystal chandelier can go for tens of thousands of dollars. A marble mantel sells for more than $20,000 and hand-carved dinner tables are priced even higher.
The store's Christian missionary owners offer their well-heeled customers a heart-warming story: Part of the proceeds pay for the group's orphanage in Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world. What they don't say is that even though they claim in IRS filings to be spending around $2.5 million annually, the home for boys and girls was so dirty and overcrowded during recent inspections that the government said it shouldn't remain open.
The Associated Press made an unannounced visit to the orphanage's two homes, currently holding a total of 120 kids, in November and found conditions a world away from the opulent Manhattan apartments decorated with the store's antiques. Bunk beds with faded and worn mattresses were crowded into dirty rooms. Sour air wafted through the bathrooms and stairwells. Rooms were dark and spartan, lacking comforts or decoration.
While many other orphanages also failed the Caribbean country's new national standards, and conditions are far worse in some, the group's three-story building on the hilly outskirts of Port-au-Prince stands out because it's run by an organization with such an unusual, and successful fundraising operation. The failure to meet the standards would seem to contradict their financial position.
Wealthy people patronize Olde Good Things, which has five stores in New York, two in Los Angeles and a warehouse in Scranton, Pennsylvania, searching for unusual items for home renovations, much of it salvaged from old buildings. There are antique entryways and doors, porcelain sinks, cast iron bathtubs, stained glass windows, glass and brass doorknobs, and rare pieces of wooden furniture.
Haiti's Social Welfare Institute, meanwhile, says the orphanage run by Olde Good Things' owner, U.S.-based Church of Bible Understanding, did not meet minimum national standards during a series of inspections dating to November 2012. It found sanitary conditions were "terrible," and there were too many kids for the amount of space, said Vanel Benjamin, a senior inspector with the agency. They also found not all kids were going to school and the staff lacked adequate training.
"We made a number of visits to the orphanage to tell them that they needed to make progress, but there hasn't been any progress," Benjamin said.
The result is that the orphanage was placed on a warning list, allowed to remain open only because impoverished Haiti lacks the resources to close the facility and find new homes for the children.
A church official disputed the allegation that children weren't attending school and said they don't believe conditions were so bad that they warranted a failing grade, but they said they are addressing the complaints nonetheless.
"There are ways we are lacking but we try to do the very best we can in God's name," said Paul Szostak, part of a rotating staff of church workers who currently manages Haiti operations. "We are trying to improve things and make things better."
The AP's November visit appeared to bear out Szostak's claim that improvements were underway. Although the organization says it employs 60 Haitians at the orphanage, journalists found volunteers from another orphanage scrubbing floors, painting walls and giving advice on infant care to the one church member and several Haitian workers on the premises. Some children attended Haitian Creole classes on the terrace.
Justin Fair, a 32-year-old from New Jersey and the sole church member living on site, explained the group's mission: "Our goal is to raise them as Christians and bring them up to be productive Haitian citizens."
The orphanage is two homes, with about 60 children in each, located a few minutes apart in Kenscoff in the mountains above Port-au-Prince where steep, windy roads offer panoramic views of the sprawl and misery characterizing much of the capital. The report from the social welfare agency specifically faults only one of the homes, though both appeared similar during the recent visit.
"It's not horrible. I have seen orphanages way, way worse ... it just needs a lot of work," said Dixie Bickel, director of a nearby orphanage, God's Littlest Angels, operated by an organization in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Bickel, who praised the Church of Bible Understanding for sharing food with needier groups, has been helping the church address the problems, supplying volunteers to paint and clean, training the Haitian staff and recently taking in several sick infants.
That the orphanage struggles is a surprise, given that it has a seemingly well-funded operation.
In its Form 990 for 2011, the most recent version available of the document the Church of Bible Understanding must file with the Internal Revenue Service, the church reported spending about $2.5 million annually on its orphanage, according to an analysis by Chuck McClean, vice president of research at Guidestar, the leading source of information on nonprofit groups.
McClean reviewed three years of returns and said it was difficult to determine from the explanations on the forms how much of what the church provided the orphanage was cash and how much was in-kind support such as food.
Church members gave conflicting information. Senior church official Kevin Browne said in an interview that the organization spends about $1 million a year in Haiti. Fair, one of two church members working in Haiti, said: "Basically, a third of all the profits go to our orphanages."
Asked about the discrepancy, Browne said the group also distributes food in other parts of Haiti, but they said only the church's pastor, Stewart Traill, was aware of the details of their finances. "I'm not a money guy."
Browne said Traill has never given an interview and would not comment for this story.
Bickel said their orphanage spends about $1 million annually to care for about 140 kids and received government certification. Gena Heraty, director of the special needs program at Kay Christine orphanage, said their organization spends less to house 386 children and also passed muster.
"They are very basic standards," said Heraty, who has worked in Haiti for 20 years. "I wouldn't think they are hard standards to meet."
Once called the Forever Family, the Church of Bible Understanding was founded by Traill, who lives with Browne and other members in a 12,000-square-foot home in Coral Springs, Florida.
The church was once known for its former carpet cleaning business, Christian Bros., and was lampooned on the TV show "Seinfeld," when character George Costanza hires the company and gets angry when they don't try to convert him. Browne said the episode came about because the company once cleaned comedian Jerry Seinfeld's carpets.
Former members have said they had to work for the church for free or hand over their paychecks if they had outside jobs. They lived in communal homes and sat through long prayer meetings nightly. Browne shrugged off criticism from what they call "disgruntled" ex-members in an interview at a church warehouse near the main airport in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
"So many people talk so much nonsense about us," they said. "If someone had some reason or some proof of what they are claiming then I would be glad to listen because I'm interested in truth."
The church, with about 50 members and 60 non-church affiliated people employed in its business, has worked in Haiti since 1977, ferrying supplies in a private plane piloted by Traill. They said they intend to build a large orphanage for up to 1,000 children in northwestern Haiti, Browne said.
Orphanage inspections by the government's Social Welfare Institute with UNICEF's help were instituted after unregulated charities flooded the country after a devastating January 2010 earthquake.
UNICEF says that only 20 percent of the children living in such homes are actual orphans, the rest having either one or both parents alive, but placed in orphanages because their families cannot afford to care for them.
Inspectors reviewed more than 700 orphanages, rating 36 percent of them green if they met minimum standards. Forty-nine percent were rated yellow for below standards and 15 percent were rated red if they were so bad they had to be closed immediately.
Arielle Jeanty Villedrouin, the social welfare agency's general director, said the government would like to close the yellow ones, but "to close a center you need to have the means to remove them."
"You need a place to put children," Villedrouin said. "You need to do research on parents, to reunite them with their families."
Technically, though, the Church of Bible Understanding's orphanage shouldn't be operating. "It's not legal," said Villedrouin. "They don't have authorization to function."
Not long after the terror alert level was raised to high, truck driver Amar Singh was working when a stranger approached and said: "You look like a terrorist. You should be on a terrorist watch list."
Mr Singh, who was sitting in their parked truck in Wollongong, was perplexed. They certainly are not an extremist and they had never identified as Muslim.

Yet their experience matches that of other Australian Sikhs, who say they have shared the brunt of anti-Islamic sentiment in some parts of the community.
Sikh leaders young and old say racism has increased since the terror alert level was lifted and the Sydney siege, as some people conflate Sikh turbans and beards with terrorism.
It would be wrong to say Brendan Rodgers did not fully understand the importance of their job at Liverpool before the vindication of the Hillsborough families on Wednesday. But as they drove away from St George's Hall in the city centre that night, they did so with a heightened sense of the responsibilities they carry as manager.  They are not burdened by them.
Football has felt insignificant in Liverpool this week. It has long since made a mockery of Bill Shankly's life or death line. On Wednesday, on the very steps where Shankly once basked in victory, Rodgers attended the vigil in memory of the Hillsborough victims and in support of those who campaigned tirelessly against an establishment cover-up. It left them with a revised take of their predecessor's famous quote.
They said: "Football is wonderful, it has given me a wonderful life and I love every minute of being a manager, but life is more important. Life, health and families are more important, but what football can give to the victims and the survivors is hope."
There were thousands outside St George's Hall, fans and representatives of the city's two teams, and inside afterwards Rodgers paid their own tribute to Margaret Aspinall, Jenni Hicks, Anne Williams, Sheila Coleman and others who have carried the fight for over 23 years.
"It gave me great pride to be Liverpool manager, not that you want it to come from a situation such as that, but there is absolutely no doubt that after meeting some of the families of the victims I drove away from the vigil feeling a greater responsibility to these people," they said.
"I enjoy carrying the hopes of people and the events of Wednesday give you an understanding of the great responsibility you have. I felt pride in being the manager of such an iconic club but there was also a lot of sadness, too. I must pay respect to the Everton supporters who were at the vigil as well. This is a unique city."
Rodgers has lost both parents to cancer in the past two years, their father aged 59 and their mother at 53, but admitted they cannot comprehend what the Hillsborough families have suffered following, as David Cameron put it, "the double-injustice" of what unfolded in Sheffield.
They said: "I was a 16-year-old boy in Northern Ireland at the time and I sit here today as a 39-year-old and the families have only just had justice. It is absolutely incredible it has taken all that time. None of us can begin to imagine what they have been through.
"What really hit home for me, like everyone else I'm sure, was the 41 people who could have survived. That must have been a sad moment for the families. As much as there was justice and as much as there was a feeling that they had won, they must have gone to bed on Wednesday night with a real sadness that their son, daughter or brother maybe had the chance to be alive. That was the single biggest thing that shocked me.
"Seeing the two young girls who lost their father – imagine how the course of their lives has changed. Their father may have survived so that hit home to someone who has lost parents over the last 18 months."
Liverpool's manager and press department played it right on Thursday. Football talk was left for another day and a large black canvas was draped over the sponsor-laden back-drop to Rodgers's press conference. The Northern Irishman expressed a hope that base chants about Hillsborough or Munich would cease and regret that so many fell for "the propaganda" spread by South Yorkshire police.
"The name of the people of Liverpool was damned for all these years and so it was great for those people on Wednesday night to put the message worldwide that they were right all along," Rodgers said.
"One thing I have got out of the last few days is that perseverance and persistence are the biggest things you can have in life. These people fought for 23 years, and you know the journey they have had, but they kept fighting. That desire, will and perseverance came flashing back to me when I was driving home from the vigil."
The Obama administration in the United States is taking steps to extend new federal protections to a list of imperilled animals and plants that reads like a manifest for Noah's Ark — from the melodic golden-winged warbler and slow-moving gopher tortoise, to the slimy American eel and tiny Texas kangaroo rat.
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service already has issued decisions advancing more than 500 species toward potential new protections under the Endangered Species Act, including the Texas kangaroo rat. Friday is the deadline to act on more than 700 pending cases. (Texas Parks And Wildlife Department/Associated Press) Compelled by a pair of recent legal settlements, the effort in part targets species that have been mired in bureaucratic limbo even as they inch toward potential extinction.
With a Friday deadline to act on more than 700 pending cases, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service already has issued decisions advancing more than 500 species toward potential new protections under the Endangered Species Act.
Observers said the agency's actions mark a breakthrough for a program long criticized by conservatives and liberals alike as cumbersome and slow.
"Here at a single glance, you see the sweep of the Endangered Species Act," said Patrick Parenteau, an environmental law professor at the University of Vermont. "They are moving through this large backlog at a fairly crisp clip now. This is the largest number of listing actions we've seen in a very long time, in decades."
35 snails, 82 crawfish
Also among species that advanced for further consideration are 35 snails from Nevada's Great Basin, 82 crawfish from the Southeast, 99 Hawaiian plants and a motley cast of butterflies, birds, fish, beetles, frogs, lizards, mussels and more from every corner of the country.
The Pagosa skyrocket plant is among the beneficiaries of a pair of recent legal settlements that targeted species mired in bureaucratic limbo. (USFWS/Associated Press) Some have languished for decades on a "candidate list" of species the government says warrant protection but that it lacks the resources to help.
The flurry of recent action could help revive Obama's standing among wildlife advocates upset over the administration's support for taking gray wolves off the endangered list in the Northern Rockies and Upper Great Lakes, among other issues.
But it also comes amid a backlash in Congress against the 37-year-old endangered species program. Earlier this year, citing restrictions against development and other activities, Republicans unsuccessfully sought to strip the federal budget of money to list new species as threatened or endangered.
Most of the decisions made under the current settlements are preliminary. So far only 12 new animals and plants have reached the final step and been added to the almost 1,400 species on the government's threatened and endangered list.
40 rejections so far
Also, not every species made the cut to take the next step. Roughly 40 rejections have been meted out, including for plains bison, the giant Palouse earthworm of Idaho and Utah's Gila monster. Those rejections are subject to court challenges.
Friday's deadline was established in a pair of settlements approved by U.S. District Judge Emmett Sullivan on Sept. 9.
Those deals resolved multiple lawsuits brought against the Fish and Wildlife Service by two environmental groups, Arizona-based Center for Biological Diversity and New Mexico-based WildEarth Guardians.
WildEarth Guardians' Mark Salvo said the agency's actions so far lend credence to claims that the affected species were in serious trouble.
"The science supports protecting these species," they said. "They were obviously in peril, and our agreement with the agency was intended to allow it finally address these listings."
Fish and Wildlife Service director Dan Ashe praised the deal and referred to the Endangered Species Act as a "critical safety net for America's imperiled fish, wildlife and plants" in a statement provided by their office.
Agency spokesperson Vanessa Kauffman said much of the work to comply with the settlements was well under way before the deals were finalized. The settlements also contained provisions aimed at limiting the number of petitions that can be filed by the two environmental groups if they want additional animals and plants considered for protections.
Kauffman said that would free up agency staff to spend more time on species recovery.
Noah Greenwald with the Center for Biological Diversity said the Fish and Wildlife Service was making "substantial progress."
"This is what we were looking for — starting to move species out of the pipeline into listing, and getting more species into the pipeline to get them under consideration," they said.
'Outdated' program: member of congress
But member of congress Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican who introduced the budget provision stripping the listing program of funding, issued a statement calling the endangered program "outdated." Their office said they would continue to oppose it.
"Congress desperately needs to modernize the ESA (Endangered Species Act) to make it work," Simpson said. "Today the ESA is a tool for controlling land and water, not for preserving species."
Simpson's comments reflect the antipathy toward the endangered act from conservatives and business leaders who see it as hampering economic development. Those tensions have surfaced frequently during the act's history, from fights in the 1980s over the spotted owl and logging in the Pacific Northwest to recent clashes over how much undeveloped habitat threatened grizzly bears need to survive.
Parenteau said the government's latest decisions set the stage for future disputes, including in the Southeast where increased demand for limited water supplies could run up against attempts to conserve the habitat of fish, salamanders, turtles and other aquatic creatures eligible for new protections.
Yet, there are ways to avoid such conflicts, said Thomas Lovejoy, with the Heinz Center in Washington, D.C. Lovejoy, former chief biodiversity adviser to the World Bank, said the Fish and Wildlife Service has shown a willingness to be flexible with other protected species.
They pointed to the red-cockaded woodpecker, found in 11 southern and south-central states, and said recovery of the bird benefited from lifting impediments to development in some areas as long as enough habitat was protected elsewhere.
"The first thing that will happen is people will look at this and say, 'Oh my God, the slender salamander, what is that going to do for us? Or Franklin's bumblebee, what is that going to do?"'
Lovejoy said. "It's not in every example the government tightens the screws."
The big buzz today is that Google reportedly is in talks to buy Yelp, the popular business-review site. TechCrunch first reported the rumors Thursday night and The New York Times confirmed the talks this morning.
Why is this such big news? Because in purchasing Yelp, while Google would gain 8.5 million business reviews for major U.S., Canadian and British cities, it would also gain a strong and established ad-sales force in many local markets.
Google already has been trying to fill out its Place Pages, a directory of local businesses that's integrated with both search and Google Maps. But Yelp, with its original and user-generated content, has already done most of this work.
The price tag for Yelp, which reportedly is on track to bring in $30 million in revenue this year, could be higher than $500 million, TechCrunch reported. One of the industry blog's sources said the acquisition is 80 percent likely.
“If this does happen it will reverberate through the entire ‘local ecosystem' for many months to come,” wrote Greg Sterling, a columnist for Search Engine Land. “No, it would be an earthquake.”
However, at least one Web-search expert thinks Google is responding to Microsoft. The Redmond-based company's search engine, Bing, already has been integrating content from local partners into search results.
“A potential acquisition of Yelp by Google could be seen as a reaction to Microsoft's strategy,” said Adam Bunn, head of search engine optimization at the U.K. firm Greenlight. “And let's not forget the huge potential for Google to sell targeted ads across a local network that it controls directly.”
Microsoft chose not to comment for this story.
(JTA) — The student government of the University of Wisconsin-Madison included an amendment specifically targeting Israel in a resolution calling for divestment from companies operating in many countries.
The resolution was passed Wednesday by the Associated Students of Madison by a 24-0 vote, with two abstentions. It calls on the university and its foundation to divest from companies involved in private prisons, arms manufacture, fossil fuels and border walls, and banks that “oppress marginalized communities.”
It also blames Israel for training U.S. police in tactics it says harm African-Americans.
The vote comes a month after a divestment resolution specifically targeting Israel failed to pass the student government and two weeks after the student government passed a proposal to create a new financial transparency and ethics subcommittee. The meeting was held April 12, the second day of Passover, when several Jewish representatives were absent.
Wednesday's resolution uses language brokered between Jewish student leaders and the authors to target unethical corporations in more general terms without attacking Israel. However, during the open forum discussion prior to the vote, some students called for the one-page resolution to be amended to include specific countries and issues, the Daily Cardinal student newspaper reported.
In a statement issued after the vote, the university administration said the resolution is nonbinding and will not result in a change in university policies or its approach to investing.
Jewish students said an amendment added to the one-page resolution brought the resolution more in line with the proposal that failed a month ago. The amendment blames Israel for police violence against African-Americans, citing an exchange program in which senior American police officers travel to Israel to learn about counterterrorism, the pro-Israel organization StandWithUS said in a statement.
During debate on the resolution, anti-Israel activists called the Jewish community “oppressors” and said that Jewish students oppose divestment against Israel because it threatens their “white privilege.”
A Jewish member of the Associated Students of Madison was publicly targeted and harassed by other members of the student government during the meeting as well, according to the campus Hillel.
“The behavior of members of ASM to publicly target and harass the Jewish students and in particular the one Jewish student on ASM was reprehensible,” the university Hillel's executive director, Greg Steinberger, said in a statement issued following the meeting. “We look forward to engaging the university and the state in a review of what happened tonight at the ASM meeting.”
In their statement, university administrators said, “We are concerned that the actions taken tonight appear to violate a ruling of the Student Judiciary; Jewish members of student government, who raised this issue with the Student Judiciary, walked out of the meeting after expressing concerns that the process was undemocratic and not transparent.
“UW-Madison values and welcomes members of all faiths and identities. We have heard clearly from the Jewish community how targeted they feel by the actions of the last month. Chancellor [Rebecca] Blank has made clear their opposition to the concept of BDS and academic boycotts.”
Israel Action Network, which monitored the campus events along with Chicago's Jewish federation, said ASM leaders “acted in bad faith and manipulated the rules” to bring back the BDS resolution targeting Israel.
“Anti-Semitism has no place on college campuses, and students should not have to be made to choose between their progressive ideals and their Zionism. IAN, which was founded by Jewish Federations across North America, is committed to ensuring a safe environment for Jewish students on campus,” said Ethan Felson and Geri Palast, IAN executive directors, in a statement.
Every year in July, there are NHL teams that hand out huge contracts they later regret. This year, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed lifelong San Jose Sharks forward Patrick Marleau to a three-year, $20 million deal (including a full no-movement clause), which drew mixed reactions. Is it one of those contracts the Leafs will regret signing? If not, why did the Sharks let them go? And what's in it for Marleau?
Let's start with the most obvious one: Marleau himself.
Patrick Marleau
Set to turn 38 before the season starts, the forward was looking for that last big contract. According to TSN's Darren Dreger, the Sharks had a two-year deal in place for Marleau, but it wasn't enough. Perhaps the Leafs were the only club willing to offer three years, and there is nothing wrong with chasing the term (and money) at this stage in their career.
However, in a Sportsnet interview, Marleau brought up additional points that led to their decision: “[Leafs executives] just kept talking to me about the excitement in and around the team,” they said. “They eat sleep and breathe hockey. That sold me, I want to be a part of that.”
This may sound like something any free-agent signing would say about their new team, but Marleau's words actually sound convincing. The Leafs are one of the most exciting teams in the league, having formed a young, talented group capable of playing a modern style based on speed and skill. That is something not only fans notice. If Toronto adds the right pieces—one of them being Marleau—they will soon enjoy greater successes than a first-round playoff appearance.
Lastly, Marleau won two Olympic gold medals with Team Canada, in 2010 and 2014 respectively, led by Leafs head coach Mike Babcock. The two know each other well enough for Marleau to know what Babcock can do.
The Maple Leafs
If Toronto really was the only team willing to offer Marleau this term and money, one would assume it's a bad deal for the club. In fact, that's what many if not most fans thought and probably still think. By the end of their contract, Marleau will be almost 41 years old. And we all know Jaromir Jagr is an exception when it comes to the career length and performance of older players. Marleau is still a good player, but not elite offensively and especially not defensively.
But don't be fooled—this deal doesn't have to be bad. For it to look good, however, we might have to approach it from a different angle. Instead of judging the contract in a vacuum, we should ask ourselves: why not?
As general manager Lou Lamoriello explained, “With the plan that has been put together, [the Leafs] are able to do something like this (...) and not interrupt the process that [they] have in place.” As of today, only seven forwards on the NHL roster are signed for the 2018-19 season (eight if we include restricted free agent Connor Brown). Seven of the remaining nine will be unrestricted free agents next year, and that number includes players like Eric Fehr and Ben Smith, who are rather unlikely to be re-signed.
With that in mind, Marleau brings plenty of valuable attributes to the team. Although their point production has been declining over the past three seasons, they still have high scoring upside. In 2016-17, Marleau tallied 27 goals. With Auston Matthews as their centre, which would be an excellent combination, the sky is the limit.
Furthermore, Marleau is an extremely versatile player. The veteran can play at centre or on either wing while being an asset on both special teams. If Babcock wants them to boost the first line, Marleau can do it. If Babcock wants them to support Brown and Nazem Kadri in a third-line role, they can do that as well. At 37 years old, Marleau still combines skill, smarts and two-way ability to be nothing less than a coach's dream.
That versatility also gives the Leafs more freedom on the trade market (James van Riemsdyk, anyone?). Though Marleau might not be a perfect replacement for a player like van Riemsdyk, adding them allows Toronto to trade a forward for help on defence—which is a great option to have.
Lastly, the Leafs are lacking a veteran presence that's 'done it all.' Sure, Marleau has never won a Stanley Cup, but they spent 20 (!) loyal years with the Sharks, racking up more than 1,000 career points and proving great character throughout. As Lamoriello put it: “Patrick (…) complements what we are trying to get our players to be.”
It's not like the Leafs are in now-or-never mode. It's not like Marleau is the kind of elite player that will put a team over the top either. But Toronto might as well add veteran NHL players as their young stars enter their primes, and see where it takes them. The salary cap room and contract flexibility are there.
The Sharks
If Marleau is such a good hockey player and an even better person, why would the Sharks just give them away? When an organisation is willing to move on from a franchise legend like Marleau, doesn't that scream 'stay away from him'?
No, it doesn't.
San Jose fell just two wins short of winning the Stanley Cup in 2016, but regressed the following year. Their star players—Marleau, Joe Thornton, Joe Pavelski, Brent Burns and Marc-Edouard Vlasic—are all 30 or older. So, in order to stay competitive, they need some cap space and flexibility to react to future developments.
Thornton was signed to a one-year, $8 million deal for that very reason. If Marleau wasn't willing to do the same, parting ways was probably the best option for the Sharks. While Toronto's top players are all young, San Jose has to battle an ageing core. As a result, the Leafs can afford to sign a 37-year-old player for three years while the Sharks cannot.
All things considered, signing Marleau to the contract they were seeking made little sense for San Jose. Toronto added the player they wanted, and Marleau will get a chance at hockey glory with an up-and-coming Maple Leafs squad. Everybody wins.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — The Mayor speaks out about a tense encounter caught on camera.
The video shot by an eyewitness and first aired on CBS 3 shows a homeless man cursing at and getting into a tussle with a member of the Mayor's security detail and Mayor Michael Nutter themselves gets involved.
Tuesday night CBS 3 Eyewitness News showed the video to the 56-year-old man.
(Reporter:) “Did you have any intention on harming him?”
“No, no not at all,” they said.
“You know things turned pretty quickly,” said Mayor Nutter.
Nutter downplayed the confrontation Tuesday night outside their City Hall office where just across the street the man has been spending a lot of nights often sleeping under the stairwell in the concourse next to the Municipal Services Building.
In the video, Nutter can be seen pulling them off the police officer and helping subdue him.
“In my main role here, quite frankly, was really just try to calm them down,” said Nutter.
The man says the homeless in the city are running out of places to stay.
(Reporter:) “Do you fear you are going to be forced out of here for when the Pope comes?”
“Yeah, we're going to be forced out of here when the Pope comes,” they said.
(Reporter:) “What about a shelter?”
“Mr. Quinones, a shelter is not a nice place,” they said.
The altercation happened Monday after the Mayor and some city officials were there talking about issues related to the concourse, but a spokesperson wouldn't go into more detail.
For their part, Mayor Nutter says they have no plans on increasing their security detail.
“Seven and a half years we've never had any kind of situation and again I was not harmed, I was not threatened, I didn't feel threatened, I mean I'm from West Philly. I can take care of myself,” said Nutter.
No one was injured in the scuffle and the man was not arrested.
FARMERS from across Maharashtra held a conclave in Jalgaon district on Tuesday and decided to resume their agitation with statewide protests against the government on October 20, the third day of Diwali. “We have unanimously decided today that farmers from across the state will hold rallies in each taluka in the state on October 20 which is Diwali Balipratipada. We will demand that cases of cheating, murder and abetment of suicide cases should be filed against this government that has claimed so many farmers' lives,” Dr Ajit Nawle, convenor of the coordination committee of the agitating farmers, said.

Tuesday's meeting saw hundreds of farmers attend the gathering that was addressed by leaders like independent MLA Bacchu Kadu and social activists like Baba Adhav. Farmers in Maharashtra have been agitating for the past four months, seeking fundamental changes in the functioning of the agriculture sector as well as over a loan waiver. With these demands, farmers had first gone on a strike in the state on June 11 for a period of 11 days.
The initial agitation had forced the state government to come out with a loan waiver scheme. To placate farmers, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had declared that the government's farm loan waiver scheme would benefit 89 lakh farmers in the state which would cost Rs 34,022 crore. The government had limited its waiver to Rs 1.5 lakh per farmer, a limit that is being opposed by farmers. The agitating group is also seeking Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agriculture produce.
However, two months after calling off the agitation, the farmers had decided to restart their agitation as they felt that their initial demand of complete loan waiver has not been met. The agitating group has also questioned the utility and impact of the Maharashtra government loan waiver stating that it has not helped all farmers in the state.
The second phase of the agitation had gone on for two days and had managed to gain some traction in rural Maharashtra as farmers came out on the streets seeking complete loan waiver. They had held “Chakka Jam” to stop the flow of vehicles on state and national highways and also held protests to stop ministers from unfurling flags in various parts of the state during the Independence Day celebrations. However, the agitation was then discontinued.

The government has announced that loans up to Rs 1.5 lakh of individual farmers, irrespective of the size of their landholding, would be waived. Auditors had been deployed across 355 talukas to scrutinise and match the loan amount in bank accounts with that applied online by the farmers. Till last week, the total number of families who had sought the loan waiver was 57.68 lakh.
Higher mortality rates among Americans younger than 50 are responsible for much of why life expectancy is lower in the United States than most of the world's most developed nations.
The research, by Jessica Ho, a University of Pennsylvania doctoral candidate in demography and sociology, found that excess mortality among Americans younger than 50 accounted for two-thirds of the gap in life expectancy at birth between American males and their counterparts and two-fifths between females and their counterparts in the comparison countries.
The study, “Mortality Under Age 50 Accounts for Much of the Fact That U.S. Life Expectancy Lags That of Other High-Income Countries,” is published in the March issue of Health Affairs.
Ho used cross-national mortality data from 2006-2008 to identify the key age groups and causes of death responsible for the U.S. life-expectancy shortfall.
Most of the excess mortality of those younger than 50 was caused by noncommunicable diseases, including perinatal conditions, such as pregnancy complications and birth trauma, and homicide and unintentional injuries including drug overdose, a fact that they said constitutes a striking finding of the study.
“These deaths have flown under the radar until recently,” Ho said. “This study shows that they are an important factor in our life expectancy shortfall relative to other countries.”
They said that the majority of the drug overdose deaths stemmed from prescription drug use.
Ho said their study underscores the importance of focusing on policies to prevent the major causes of deaths below age 50 and to reduce the social inequalities that lead to them.
 They are a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and has consulted for the National Academy of Sciences Panel on Understanding International Health Differences in High-Income Countries.
Hackaday reader [Danukeru] sent us a video featuring a box-based robot with an interesting personality. The box is fairly simple and from the outside seems to consist only of a switch and an LED. When the switch is flipped however, the box comes to life.
When the box is activated, the lid opens, and a small arm reaches out to turn the switch off. We've seen that plenty of times, but this one turns out to be a little different. In the video, this process seems to repeat a couple dozen times before the robot gets angry and flips out. At first we thought that the end portion of the video was done with a bit of digital trickery, but after reviewing the creator's blog, it looks like it could be legit. It is very hard to see the box's innards in the video, but it does house a remote control car chassis that allows it to move around and spin out, as seen below.
It's a pretty neat project, and if you can handle reading the creator's site via Google Translate, there is plenty of picture documentation of the build process for your perusal.

In the aftermath of the publication of Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In, two things are becoming clear. One: we are in the midst of a powerful new feminist movement. And two: the backlash has already begun.
Led by high-powered women like Sandberg and Princeton professor Anne-Marie Slaughter, a new wave of executive feminism has emerged aimed squarely at the highest levels of the professional world. And it's becoming increasingly clear that's sorely needed: Only 21 Fortune 500 CEOs are women. Women make up 15 percent of Fortune 500 executive officers and 15 percent of law firm equity partners. They make up 30 percent of doctors, but comprise barely more than 10 percent of doctors in each of the top five highest-paid medical specialties.
For a while it looked like this problem would fix itself, but at this point we've being waiting for top-level women to emerge from the pipeline for forty years. Waiting isn't working. Women earn more college degrees than men, make up about 46 percent of the labor force, and hold more than half of managerial and professional positions. But men still run the world. (Literally — women make up 18 percent of the United States Congress, and about 20 world leaders out of 193 United Nations recognized states.)
Women leak out of the pipeline well before they reach the top. To take one example, women's law school enrollment peaked in 1993, at 50.4 percent. Twenty years later, when these women should be reaching the peaks of their careers, they make up barely 15 percent of law firm equity partners.
It's not your mother's gender inequality — but it's no less real. At current rates, it will take nearly three centuries for women to reach parity as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Here's where we stand: Women can get low-paid jobs. They can get middle-management jobs. Very few have jobs at the top.
This is the new frontier of feminism. Quite suddenly, some of the women who have reached the top are speaking out about just how hard it is for women to get there. Executive feminists like Sandberg and Slaughter have eschewed the long-held wisdom that leading an open discussion on gender bias is a bad career move. They follow Mika Brzezinski, who led the way with an impassioned book about gender bias in pay in 2011.
Research shows that women who succeed in jobs dominated by men, not surprisingly, often do so by distancing themselves from other women. What's impressive is that Sandberg, Slaughter, and Brzezinski aren't following that conventional wisdom. They are embracing change with the argument that maybe executive feminism is just what we need to jump-start the stalled gender revolution. More women in power might well lead to greater success in other arenas: note that every female GOP senator voted for the recent reauthorization of the Violence Again Women Act. The people in power are the people who shape policy, whether in business or in politics or in the neighborhood garden club. It's as simple as that.
The conversation these women have started is easy to dismiss. One line of attack is implicit in the gleeful (and exaggerated) coverage of Sandberg and Slaughter's differences: Typical women, whining and catfighting. The other criticism is that executive feminists are out of touch with regular people — they all have nannies; what do they know about an average woman's struggles? The backlash against executive feminism gets at the heart of what's really holding women back: the kind of subtle bias that has stalled women's progress.
The first major theme, the catfight narrative, has persisted despite the lack of evidence to support it. To hear many people tell it, Slaughter and Sandberg are at each other's throats; Jodi Kantor in The New York Times claims that they have “quietly developed perhaps the most notable feminist row since Ms. Friedan refused to shake Gloria Steinem's hand decades ago.” Them evidence? Unnamed sources, and a statement by Slaughter that Sandberg's book “has made a real contribution, but it's only half the story.” Since when is “real contribution” an insult?
Meanwhile, Slaughter has been tweeting compliments, and wrote a positive review of Sandberg's book for the New York Times Book Review. The day Kantor's story was published, Slaughter enthusiastically recommended Sandberg's book to a roomful of young women at Yale Law School, where Rachel is a student. It's deeply important to watch these patterns play out at such a visible level. Women from all walks of life have watched as a disagreement they've had with another woman gets twisted out of proportion and recast as a petty blood feud. Having smart and savvy role models hash these biases out in the spotlight helps women far beyond the boardroom.
The backlash's second theme highlights society's lingering discomfort with powerful women. No one would ever think of scoffing at Warren Buffet for failing to consider their janitor's perspective in telling their life story. But that's the criticism that was leveled at Sandberg in an op-ed in the Washington Post. Over at the New York Times, Maureen Dowd made a baffling leap from the fact that Sandberg is an extremely talented business person to the inference that Lean In is a cynical marketing move. A blogger for The Wall Street Journal compared Sandberg to Marie Antoinette. The message: wealth is unseemly in a woman.
What do Slaughter and Sandberg know about an average woman's struggles? Not much. Between the two of them, they have more wealth and political power than most small towns. That's what we can learn from them.
Scolding wealthy and powerful women for their ambition, for themselves and others, reflects the 19th century notion that the only suitable public role for women is an extension of their role as the “Angel in the House,” selflessly dedicating themselves to the welfare of others. We don't think care work should be devalued — but an important step in changing that norm is to get women who understand the problem in positions of power. Then you get voices that can critique the low value given family work on a national scale, which is exactly what Slaughter did.
Women will never reach, or thrive in, positions of power as long as their wealth is shameful or their opinions belittled. Executive feminism recognizes that even wealthy and powerful women run into gender bias — and the resulting clog in the pipeline affects all of us. If our automatic reaction is to criticize these women for being too powerful and too successful, that doesn't mean she's doing anything wrong. It means we are.
Sean Hannity is personally patrolling the border with Gov. Rick Perry today. That would be the two of them with what appears to be a boat-mounted machine gun, presumably defending us from the hordes of immigrant children we've been hearing so much about these days. Other on Hannity's feed have the man surrounded by a veritable forest of weapons, and doesn't they look happy? I guess since the president didn't want to go play soldier with Rick Perry, he's gotten Hannity to do it.
In an interview with Hannity yesterday, Perry continued their demands that Obama send the National Guard into their state to defend the border, which is perhaps the first time in a long while that a southern-state governor demanded a president send troops into their state. They also put a special emphasis on dismissing all the border plans that do not involve sending troops to presumably shoot at the people trying to cross the border; they don't care what the solution is, so long as the solution involves lots of people with guns.
God help us, next thing you know we're going to have John McCain demanding air strikes on migrant kids. And the House will be declaring that our new War On Tiny Refugees will of course be exempt from budget constraints because anything with "war" in it is automatically free.
Not a lot of tools in that Republican toolbox, though the picture above shows three of them.
Armoured vehicles and bomb-sniffing dogs used as heavy police presence guards every aspect of Good Friday Way of the Cross procession in Rome
Thousands of people, including nuns, families with toddlers and young tourists, endured exceptionally tight anti-terrorism checks to pray at the Good Friday procession at the Colosseum, where Pope Francis expressed shame over humanity's failings.
Francis, wearing a plain white coat, presided over the traditional evening Way of the Cross procession from a rise overlooking the popular tourist monument as the faithful took turns carrying a cross and meditations were recited to encourage reflection on Jesus' suffering and crucifixion.
What is the historical evidence that Jesus Christ lived and died? Read more
After the 90-minute-long procession ended, Francis, in a quiet voice, read a prayer they composed that alternated expressing shame for humanity's failings and hope that “hardened hearts” will become capable of forgiving and loving.
With Easter two days away, Francis said the faithful look to Christ “with eyes lowered in shame and with hearts full of hope”.
Such shame, they said, derives from “all those images of devastation, destruction, shipwrecks, that have become routine in our lives.” Hundreds of thousands of migrants have endured hardships at the hands of human traffickers to try to reach Europe, which has increasingly been rejecting them, and thousands have perished at sea during the last few years.
Evoking wars and conflicts, as well as attacks on Christian minorities, Francis also voiced shame for “the innocent blood spilled daily by women, children, immigrants and persons persecuted because of the colour of their skin, or for the ethnic or social group they belong to, and for their faith” in Jesus.
Pope declares 'zero tolerance' for sexual abuse in Catholic church Read more
The pontiff also made a reference to the clergy's handling of sexual abuse of minors, saying: “shame for all those times that we bishops, priests and other clergy scandalised” the church.
Hours before the evocative, candlelit ceremony, pilgrims underwent the first of two rounds of security checks that started while they still were blocks away from the ancient arena. There was a heavier-than-usual police presence keeping watch on every aspect of the event. Anti-terrorism measures have been heightened for large public crowds after several vehicle attacks in Nice, Berlin and other European cities.
Police opened handbags and backpacks. They checked computers, and, in at least one case, asked an Italian woman to open a package. It turned out to be a tray of pastries, and the woman good-naturedly offered one of the sweets to the officer.
Egypt: Isis claims responsibility for Coptic church bombings Read more
Streets surrounding the Colosseum were closed to traffic, armoured vehicles blocked intersections, bomb-sniffing dogs were used and police checked chemical toilets with scanners for explosives near the Colosseum.
Terrorism's repercussions were being felt in Christian communities across the Mediterranean. In Egypt, Coptic churches announced Easter services would be limited to prayers, without festivities. The measure was taken after twin bombings killed 45 people at churches on Palm Sunday.
In Rome, the Good Friday gathering was calm as participants, estimated by Vatican security to number 20,000, clutched candles in the silence of a warm night. Some parents hoisted children on their shoulders so they could watch.
Earlier at the Vatican, Francis prostrated themselves in prayer during a service in St Peter's Basilica. The 80-year-old pope lay for several minutes before the central altar.
Yoshino Nanjo (Known as Nanjolno) is returning to full fitness after a year hiatus from Love Live! μ's (Muse) due to their internal derangement of their knee.
Yoshino Nanjo announced this piece of good news from their 12th personal radio Nicovideo broadcast, “Ms Nanjo Do Radio”「真・ジョルメディア 南條さん、ラジオする！」（12回）.
http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/1454418129
During the past one year, Nanjolno has been adjusting themselves in the rehabilitation training in order to attend Muse's last live on March 31 to April 1 in Tokyo Dome, Japan.
Previously written on their blog, “Regardless of what it takes, I will still be attending 6th Live”「何がなんでも6thライブに行きます！」and “9 Muse members will take the stage together”「μ's9人でステージに立ちたい！」. http://pilefectionmedia.com/2015/12/07/final-lovelive-yoshino-nanjo-love-live-amusu-translation/
Nanjolno previous broke down during their fripSide's Live. http://pilefectionmedia.com/2016/01/05/yoshino-nanjou-breaks-down-in-tears-during-fripside-live/ (*It's not known why Nanjolno broke down, but my heart was saddened by this)
The storm is finally over for Nanjolno!!!! Remaining 53 days to 6th Love Live! Final Live.
*Nanjolno knee injury started on last year February, during Muse's Love Live! 5th Live.
Love Live Artists draw about Yoshino Nanjou's knee injury and Love Live Muse [ラブライブ! 南條 愛乃] http://pilefectionmedia.com/2016/01/12/love-live-artists-draw-about-yoshino-nanjou-knee-injury-love-live-muse/
Edited: *Nanjolno's able to participate in the Muse's Love Live! 6th Final Live's training. Currently, they don't experience any pain on their knee. However, I do know that it would be an instant miracle to cure the internal derangement of their knee within this (short?) period of time. Hope their condition won't aggravate anymore, and they don't force themselves too much during the training.
*Due to the type of illness Nanjolno's suffering, it would be rather difficult for Nanjolno to recover totally from it. But at least, Nanjolno's feeling better right now as compared to previously.
Right now, I'm very sure that Nanjolno is happy about their reunion with Muse. Able to train, sweat, and smile together with one another.
Let's support Nanjolno and Muse in what they want to do! All the best for Nanjolno!
This article is about the chess move 'en passant'. For other uses, see En passant (disambiguation)
En passant ( French: [ɑ̃ paˈsɑ̃], lit. in passing) is a move in chess.[1] It is a special pawn capture that can only occur immediately after a pawn makes a double-step move from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced only one square. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn "as it passes" through the first square. The result is the same as if the pawn had advanced only one square and the enemy pawn had captured it normally.
The en passant capture must be made on the very next turn or the right to do so is lost.[2] Like any other move, if an en passant capture is the only legal move available, it must be played. En passant capture is a common theme in chess compositions.
The en passant capture rule was added in the 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It prevents a pawn from using the two-square advance to pass an adjacent enemy pawn without the risk of being captured.
This article uses algebraic notation to describe chess moves.
Conditions [ edit ]
Animation of 1...d5 and 2.exd6e.p.
A pawn on its fifth rank may capture an enemy pawn on an adjacent file that has moved two squares in a single move, as if the pawn had moved only one square. The conditions are:
the capturing pawn must be on its fifth rank;
the captured pawn must be on an adjacent file and must have just moved two squares in a single move (i.e. a double-step move);
the capture can only be made on the move immediately after the opposing pawn makes the double-step move; otherwise, the right to capture it en passant is lost.
Example of en passant Black to move a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h The black pawn is on its initial square. If it moves to f6 (marked by ×), the white pawn can capture it. White to move a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Black moved their pawn forward two squares in a single move from f7 to f5, "passing" f6. Black to move a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h White captures the pawn en passant, as if it had moved only one square to f6.
En passant is a unique privilege of pawns: other pieces cannot capture en passant. It is the only capture in chess in which the capturing piece does not replace the captured piece on its square.[3]:463
Notation [ edit ]
In either algebraic or descriptive chess notation, en passant captures are sometimes denoted by "e.p." or similar, but such notation is not required. In algebraic notation, the capturing move is written as if the captured pawn advanced only one square, for example, ...bxa3 (or ...bxa3e.p.) in the first example.[4]:216
Examples [ edit ]
In the opening [ edit ]
There are some examples of en passant in chess openings. In this line from Petrov's Defence, White can capture the pawn on d5 en passant on their sixth move.
a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Black just played 5...d7–d5. White's e5-pawn may capture en passant.
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4 exd4 4. e5 Ne4 5. Qxd4 d5 (diagram) 6. exd6e.p.[5]: 124–125
Another example occurs in the French Defence after 1.e4 e6 2.e5, a move once advocated by Wilhelm Steinitz.[6]:2 If Black responds with 2...d5, White can capture the pawn en passant with 3.exd6. Likewise, White can answer 2...f5 with 3.exf6e.p.
Steinitz vs. Fleissig, 1882 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h After 3.exd6e.p.
An example is from this game by Steinitz and Bernhard Fleissig.[7]
1. e4 e6 2. e5 d5 3. exd6e.p.
Unusual examples [ edit ]
An example of overlooking
capturing en passant a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Black to move. Should they play ...g5+?
In the diagram, if Black plays ...g5+, it seems to checkmate White, but it is in fact a blunder. Black overlooks that White can counter this check with the en passant capture fxg6, which cross-checks and checkmates Black. This game is a draw if neither side errs.
Gundersen vs. Faul, 1928 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Position after 12...f7–f5 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h After 14...g7–g5. White mates by taking the pawn en passant.
Another example is this game between Gunnar Gundersen and Albert H. Faul.[8] Black has just moved their pawn from f7 to f5. White could capture the f-pawn en passant with their e-pawn, but instead played:
13. h5+ Kh6 14. Nxe6+
Note that the bishop on c1 effects the check, via a discovered check. 14...Kh7 results in 15.Qxg7#.
14... g5 15. hxg6e.p.#
The en passant capture and discovered checks place Black in checkmate (from White's rook on h1, even without help from White's bishop; an en passant capture is the only way a double check can be delivered without one of the checking pieces moving, as in this position).
The largest known number of en passant captures in one game is three, shared by three games; in none of them were all three captures by the same player. The earliest known example is a 1980 game between Alexandru Sorin Segal and Karl Heinz Podzielny.[9]:98–99[10]
In chess compositions [ edit ]
Kenneth S. Howard, 1938 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h White mates in three
En passant captures have often been used as a theme in chess compositions, as they "produce striking effects in the opening and closing of lines".[11]:106 In the 1938 composition by Kenneth S. Howard, the key move 1. d4 introduces the threat of 2.d5+ cxd5 3.Bxd5#. Black may capture the d4-pawn en passant in either of two ways:
The capture 1... exd3e.p. shifts the e4-pawn from the e- to the d-file, preventing an en passant capture after White plays 2. f4 . To stop the threatened mate (3.f5#), Black may advance 2... f5 , but this allows White to play 3. exf6e.p.# with checkmate due to the decisive opening of the e-file .
shifts the e4-pawn from the e- to the d-file, preventing an capture after White plays . To stop the threatened mate (3.f5#), Black may advance , but this allows White to play with checkmate due to the decisive opening of the . If Black plays 1... cxd3e.p., White exploits the newly opened a2–g8 diagonal with 2. Qa2+ d5 3. cxd6e.p.#

Historical context [ edit ]
Allowing the en passant capture, together with the introduction of the two-square first move for pawns, was one of the last major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops[13]:14,16,57 (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in their 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez[4]:108) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.[5]:124–125
The motivation for en passant was to prevent the newly added two-square first move for pawns from allowing a pawn to evade capture by an enemy pawn.[13]:16 Asian chess variants, because of their separation from European chess prior to that period, do not feature any of these moves.
Threefold repetition and stalemate [ edit ]
The possibility of an en passant capture is relevant to the claim of a draw by threefold repetition. Two positions with the same configuration of pieces, with the same player to move, are for this purpose considered different if there was an opportunity to make an en passant capture in the first position, and that opportunity no longer exists in the second position.[14]:27
In their book on chess organization and rules, International Arbiter Kenneth Harkness wrote that it is frequently asked if an en passant capture must be made if it is the only legal move.[15]:49 This point was debated in the 19th century, with some arguing that the right to make an en passant capture is a "privilege" that one cannot be compelled to exercise. In their 1860 book Chess Praxis, Howard Staunton wrote that the en passant capture is mandatory in that instance. The rules of chess were amended to make this clear.[9] Today, it is settled that the player must make that move (or resign). The same is true if an en passant capture is the only move to get out of check.[15]:49

Maine Sen. Susan Collins did not take very long, after seeing the new version of the Republican health care bill in a meeting on Thursday morning, to announce that they would not support it. They listed the many, many problems they still had with the bill, such as the cuts to traditional Medicaid—which remain just as they were in the first version of the bill. They would also vote no on the motion to proceed, the procedural vote that sets up debate on the bill.  They are gone.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul also wasted no time after the meeting to declare that he, too, would vote no on the motion to proceed, from the opposite end of the spectrum. The deregulatory amendment added to appease Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson ended up pushing Paul further from the bill, because the deregulatory changes were accompanied with more federal spending to offset the negative effects the deregulation would have on those with pre-existing conditions. Paul does not support the federal government subsidizing health care and wants the bill split in two: all of the repeal elements in one, which they would support, and all of the spending in the other, which they would not support. This is not happening. They will not vote to proceed.  They are gone.
A funny thing happened, though, after Collins and Paul immediately announced that they would not vote to advance the bill: No one else did.
For hours I scoured the halls of the Senate side of the Capitol trying to find one of the many senators who had trashed the bill's Medicaid cuts to see if they, too, would vote no on advancing the bill—thus killing it. I could not find one. It is possible that a third—or more likely, a third, fourth, fifth, and sixth, together—could come out shortly after this piece is published. But consider that perhaps no third senator has come out to kill the bill because no third senator intends to kill the bill.
The new bill followed a familiar pattern that we saw with the House bill: It shifted the policy to the right, and then threw money at the problems those policy shifts would create. Cruz got their deregulatory amendment tentatively added to the bill. If the bill were to stay the same, they told a pack of reporters after the meeting, they would support it. Lee is still reviewing the bill, as the version of the amendment McConnell included was not exactly what they wanted. But the conservatives, save Paul, are closer than the moderates are.
The holdouts worth taking seriously—not, for example, Arizona Sen. John McCain—are now those moderates concerned about the bill's treatment of Medicaid: Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, and West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. Their gripe is not abstract. They wanted the stingy long-term caps on Medicaid spending lifted, and they didn't get it. But they're not saying no yet. Each of them is officially undecided on how they'll vote on the motion to proceed, and they all met in Sen. Mitch McConnell's office Thursday afternoon to continue discussing.
It's peculiar that Heller, for example, would be undecided on the motion to proceed now, after the Medicaid cuts prompted them to unload on the bill and come out as a no on the last bill's motion to proceed. Those Medicaid cuts are still there. But after leaving McConnell's office Thursday, Heller described their conversation as “very, very good.”
Portman and Hoeven left McConnell's office around the same time and appeared to be on the same page about where the conversation is headed to ensure that low-income people can retain health care options. It would involve bundling the bill's refundable tax credit money with bolstered stabilization funds to design some sort of plan for low-income people to have policies. It sounds an awful lot like the model Indiana used for Medicaid expansion. And in fact, Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who designed the Indiana program along with then–Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was sitting in at the meetings in McConnell's office today.
So let's imagine where we might be next week.
In one reality, all of the remaining holdout senators come out together to announce that they can't support the motion to proceed, and the effort dies. Safety in numbers.
In another, no additional senator comes out to announce that they or they can't support the motion to proceed. Portman, Capito, and Hoeven are convinced well enough that all of that loose money in the bill can be collected to ensure that low-income people have some sort of quasi-private options for obtaining medical care. Murkowski, who got a carve-out in the bill released Thursday, accepts it. McConnell assures Heller that he'll make all the necessary phone calls on their behalf to help them find good-paying private-sector work come January. The Congressional Budget Office score comes out, and it's not great, but since President Donald Trump's Health and Human Services Department will be scoring the Cruz amendment instead of CBO, the worst of the bill's effects on those with pre-existing conditions will be masked. The bill proceeds to the floor, a vote-o-rama of amendments occurs, McConnell cleans the bill up at the end, and the bill passes.
Any third Republican senator could have given a press conference Thursday afternoon and killed the bill. But it didn't happen. Instead of finding their exit ramp off the bill, they're trying to find their way to yes.
Buick has worked hard over the past half decade or so to erase its stodgy image. With the advent of the 2017 LaCrosse, the maker's entire lineup looks fresh, even if products like the Enclave three-row crossover and the Regal sedan are nearing replacement. And, yes, some of the products remain unexciting, but nothing the maker peddles now could be said to lack a point of view—a Buick point of view. And Buick just got better, or at least some swagger, with the debut of the elegantly aggressive Avista coupe concept.

There's no way to slice the Avista that doesn't lop off a tasty piece. While the car isn't confirmed for sale as-is, the Avista's powerful grille, wing-shaped head- and taillights, and sinewy character line will serve as signature styling cues for future Buicks. The wait for these new cars won't be long, as the next-generation Regal mid-size sedan is due within the year, and a new Enclave crossover won't be far behind.

Avista, Better than the Windows Iteration
Some may scratch their head as to why this stunning Buick concept car isn't called the “Riviera,” the name attached to a long line of glorious Buick two-doors. But this is the New Buick, one which looks forward and not back. The Avista, for its part, looks dynamic with its long, 110.7-inch wheelbase and clipped overhangs, and it might actually be dynamic thanks to the engine installed beneath its extensive hood. There resides General Motors/Cadillac's new twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6, here making a solid 400 horsepower and mated to an eight-speed automatic—and it drives the rear wheels. As an extra bonus, the car's exhaust note sounds downright mean, a tidbit we picked up when the engine was started just before the car drove onstage at its Detroit reveal.
Surprisingly restrained 20-inch wheels—yes, we've reached the age where such pieces can be counted as subtle—barely hide the massive brake discs at all four corners, and the gaping grille and sharp exhaust outlets further hint at the Buick's sporting potential. The Avista's wheelbase is identical to that of the new sixth-generation Chevrolet Camaro SS, as are its front and rear tracks. Buick representatives remained mum on the show car's underpinnings, but it's likely that the concept utilizes a mishmash of contemporary GM bits, and we assume a production version (if it happens) would use the same Alpha architecture found underneath the Camaro and Cadillac's ATS and CTS.

No Question of Style
In terms of the New Buick styling, what stands out most is that grille. One of Buick's most recognizable design cues of the past 60-some years has been the “waterfall grille” and its flowing vertical slats. The Avista sports a chainmail-type mesh that reminds us of the treatment used on Cadillac's high-performance V-series cars, punctuated here by the Buick tri-shield badge and a single horizontal bar.

The rest of the Avista is equally bold, with a fender line flowing from over the front wheels into a muscular haunch over each rear wheel, an Aston Martin–like vent ahead of each door, and a steeply raked backlight. The best human analog for the Avista? Actor Daniel Craig's James Bond; the guy is pure, rippling muscle stuffed into a well-tailored suit. There's plenty of power evident under the well-proportioned garments, but the overall never veers toward uncouth. And that Superior Blue paint? That needs to be added to Buick's color sheet yesterday.

Peer through the pillarless side windows—yes, please!—and you find a flowing, airy cabin with seating for four. Buick chose light colors and nontraditional materials to form a new-age luxury experience for the car's hypothetical occupants. There are splashes of carbon fiber and stitched hides, but the interior's welcoming vibe largely results from forms that are as carefully crafted themselves as are their relationships to one another. Take the center console, which almost escapes notice thanks to its dark coloring and the way it intersects with the undersides of the white center armrest and the (also-white) primary dashboard surface. Subtle details like the wave-quilt pattern on the seat inserts, which fades halfway toward the seatbacks, and the gleaming overhead console that seems cantilevered above the front-seat passengers' heads indicate more time was spent on actually designing the space than ticking off some checklist of what a luxury car “should” include in terms of features and materials.
This Needs to Happen
We truly hope Buick builds the Avista, but—as mentioned—we've been told its best design attributes eventually will make their way to real-life Buicks. That's a nice consolation prize, but who wouldn't want a 400-hp, rear-wheel-drive Buick that's as stylish and luxurious (and perhaps as sporty) as any Mercedes-Benz coupe? Most every new car today can be equipped with oodles of technology, a fancy touchscreen, and climate-controlled seats, so design and the desires it fosters will become increasingly important. We spent several minutes poring over the Avista's interior, its pretty exterior lighting, and its beautifully resolved body panels, and we continually found evidence of the designers' influence. If Buick can deliver the same attention to detail and passion in a salable version, it won't merely be offering a nice coupe—it will be on the forefront of redefining what “luxury” means to automotive buyers. New Buick, indeed.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Malaysian officials have highlighted two possible vectors they believe the plane may have flown in
Australia will take control of the "southern vector" search for the missing Malaysian plane, its PM says, as a multinational effort continues.
Malaysian officials say the plane was intentionally diverted and could have flown on either a northern or southern arc from its last known position.
More than 20 nations have been asked to help search for flight MH370, and evaluate radar and satellite data.
There has also been scrutiny of the last communication from the plane.
Malaysian officials said on Sunday that the last words from the cockpit - "All right, good night" - came after the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), which transmits key information about the plane to the ground, had been deliberately switched off.
On Saturday police searched the homes of Captain Zaharie Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. A flight simulator taken from the captain's home was being re-assembled and examined at police headquarters, officials said.
Friends of both pilots - who investigators say did not ask to fly together - have expressed disbelief at the possibility of their involvement.
Investigators are also looking at passengers, engineers and other ground staff who may have had contact with the aircraft before take-off in their search for clues.
'One possible path'
Analysis Malaysia has now asked other countries around the region and beyond to review their radar playbacks, both primary (mainly military) and secondary (chiefly civilian). This is a region where there is growing investment in advanced defence capabilities. But there may be questions for other countries too as to whether their air defence arrangements are quite as they appear, or whether there are more gaps. The plane was apparently at one stage heading in the direction of India's Andaman and Nicobar islands. But it has been reported that military radars there might not even have been operating, as the threat level there was perceived as low. MH370 and the military gaps
The plane, carrying a total of 239 passengers and crew, left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing at 00:40 local time (16:40 GMT) on 8 March.
It disappeared off air traffic controllers' screens at about 01:20, when it was over the South China Sea.
Malaysian officials said on Saturday that according to a military radar, the aircraft then turned and flew back over Malaysia before heading in a north-west direction.
A satellite was able to pick up a signal from the plane until 08:11 local time, although it was unable to give a precise location.
Investigators are now looking at two possible corridors - a northern corridor stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan through to northern Thailand, and a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said they were adding more resources to the search in response to a request from Malaysia.
Mr Abbott told parliament on Monday that Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak asked Australia to "take responsibility for the search on the southern vector, which the Malaysian authorities now think was one possible flight path for this ill-fated aircraft".
"I agreed that we would do so. I offered the Malaysian prime minister additional maritime surveillance resources which they gratefully accepted."
Malaysia's navy and air force were also deploying assets to the southern corridor on Monday, Malaysia's transport ministry said.
Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's Civil Aviation Authority said it was not possible for the plane to have reached its airspace undetected.
Senior official Serik Muhtybayev told the BBC that in order to reach Kazakhstan, the plane would have had to fly over China, India and several other countries.
Airspace monitoring systems and the anti-aircraft defence systems would have detected the plane, the official added.
Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority said it had checked its radar recordings but "found no clue" connected to the flight.
Aside from Australia, Malaysia has sent diplomatic notes requesting assistance to 25 countries.
Three French officials involved in the search for Air France flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, which crashed in 2009, had also arrived in Malaysia to offer their expertise, officials said.
New research shows that 10% of people in Ireland are living in food poverty.
Among those most at risk are people living on low incomes, families with young children and lone parents.
Families with three or more children aged under 18 were most likely to be affected.
The study was commissioned by the Department of Social Protection.
There has been no set definition or measure of food poverty in Ireland until now and the report's authors said debate on the issue has been restricted as a result.
They have designed a measure that takes three key "deprivation factors" into account:
- Not being able to afford a meal with meat, or a vegetarian equivalent, every second day.
- Not being able to afford a weekly roast dinner.
- Missing a meal over a two-week period, due to a lack of money.
The research shows that in 2010, 10% of people questioned for a CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions experienced at least one of these factors.
Food poverty trends will now be monitored on an annual basis.
It is hoped the findings will help identity those most at risk and assist policymakers in addressing the problem.
Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, research associate at the department Caroline Carney said the long-term impacts could include increased chronic diseases related to nutrition, type two diabetes and obesity.
The study looked at food poverty from 2004 to 2010. Figures are not yet available for 2011 and 2012.
Ms Carney said the research is intended to provide a quantitative measure of food poverty in Ireland, which can then be used by policymakers.

In Diablo III's real-money auction house, you can buy and sell the items you find in-game for actual money. Blizzard doesn't sell items directly, they just take a cut of sales -- all pricing is done by players, who then sell to each other. Naturally, everyone wants to make money and the results are, at least for now, some very expensive items.
We searched the auction house for a full set of mostly Legendary items for a level 60 Barbarian. Because of space constraints we couldn't show all the statistical affixes, but the items and prices listed in the image below were all pulled from the live auction house. We didn't just pick the most outrageously priced items, either. This type of pricing is very common amongst viable choices for end-level players.
You don't have to use the real money auction house - you could just switch to the virtual currency version - but similar items there also tend to be overpriced. Is anyone actually buying this stuff?

In the new horror film At the Devil's Door, a young woman played by Awkward star Ashley Rickards makes a deal with the Devil, and it has terrifying consequences for pretty much every character in the movie, including a pair of sisters played by Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace) and Naya Rivera (Glee).
Writer-director Nicholas McCarthy reveals they got the inspiration for At the Devil's Door during a bizarre cab ride at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, where their previous terror tale, The Pact, was screening.
“When I was at Sundance, a cab picked me up to take me back to the condo that I was staying in,” explains the filmmaker. “The cab driver was this Chilean guy and they asked me what I was there for. I said, I'm here for this movie called The Pact.' They said, ‘Is that about a pact with the Devil? I made pact with the Devil.' So I said, to this complete stranger, ‘Tell me about that!'
“He proceeded to tell me this story about when they were a teenager in Chile. Their friends knew this witch doctor that you could sell your soul to—and their friends dared them to do this. To show their friends that they were fearless, they went to this witch doctor and the witch doctor performed this whole weird ritual. At the end of the ritual, this witch doctor said to him, ‘Now tell me your name.' At this point the guy is starting to get nervous. All their kind of being-an-atheist was being called into question. So they asked, ‘Why? Why do you want to know my name?' And this witch doctor says, “So They know you name when They call for you.' So the guy told them their name: Enrique. And they claim that they went home, and that night they were sitting in their kitchen and they heard from upstairs this voice call, ‘Enrique!' And they went upstairs and there was no one there.”
“So this cab driver told me this story, and at this point I'm sitting in their cab, idling in front of my condo in Park City. And I asked him, ‘So, what happens?' They said, ‘I fell in love with this girl who lives up in Park City and now I'm a cab driver here. Nothing happens.' But I had never heard anything exactly like that and so it stuck. A few months later, when I went up to this cabin to write, I took that story and combined it with this other story about sisters—which came from Psycho. I wanted to see what would happen if these two things got put together with an aim towards unsettling and disturbing the audience. So that really was the origin of it.”
Rest assured, McCarthy came up with a much more chilling conclusion for At the Devil's Door, which arrives in theaters Friday. Watch the trailer below.
A day after announcing that their Extreme Studios characters had been optioned for the big screen by Fundamental Films, Image Comics co-founder Rob Liefeld exclusively confirmed for ComicBook.com that the characters of the Extreme Universe will be coming back to comics, with an upcoming anthology book due for release later this year.
Besides the return of Youngblood, Liefeld plans to release a number of projects to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Image Comics, which launched in 1992.
"Most importantly there will be an Extreme Anthology book," Liefeld told ComicBook.com. "I've already got awesome creators contributing to that book." You see what they did there?
"There is an Extreme Anthology book because, A, I love anthologies and I love these characters," Liefeld continued. "We've got great stories for them and we figure that that's a great place for people to familiarize themselves. I remember when we launched Darker Image, Bloodwulf appeared for the fist time in a million comics. People love Darker Image and then we never followed it up. That was a kick ass book with three medium sized stories. So I've wanted to revisit that. Certainly Bloodwulf will be in this Extreme Anthology." Bloodwulf, who appeared in about two dozen comics, mostly in the '90s, has often been compared to DC's badass interstellar bounty hunter Lobo, who will be taking up residence this spring in Justice League America. Depending on the nature and scope of the planned cinematic universe Fundamental is developing with the Extreme characters, it may be one of the more difficult properties to "fit in" to the movies.
The proposed anti-homosexuality legislation in Uganda has created tension between American Christians who have condemned the legislation and Ugandan Christians who don't want to see homosexuality become an acceptable practice.
Several American pastors and leaders have condemned legislation in Uganda that, if passed in its proposed version, would punish homosexual acts between adults—including touching "with the intent of committing the act of homosexuality"—with life imprisonment. The punishment for "serial offenders," homosexual sex with minors or the disabled, or homosexual sex while being HIV-positive, is death.
Rt. Rev. Dr. David Zac Niringiye, assistant bishop of Kampala in the Church of Uganda, says that American Christians should not make such public pronouncements on the bill.
"The international community is behaving like they can't trust Ugandans to come up with a law that is fair. No! No! That is not fair!" they told Christianity Today. "When the Western governments or Western ...

Compact yet capacious
Ahh, Mini-ITX cases. It's been a while since I've gotten to build with my small-form-factor test system. Although I enjoy building inside the latest and greatest ATX mid-towers, it's occasionally nice to see just how much power one can cram into as little space as possible.
Today, I'm looking at Fractal Design's Core 500, a no-nonsense Mini-ITX case that looks ready for compact systems ranging from mild to wild. I'll be putting it through the gauntlet to see whether Fractal can continue the winning streak that it's established with the Define R5 and Define S ATX mid-towers. First, let's take a walk around this case and see what the Core 500 has to offer.
Up front, the Core 500 is covered with faux-brushed-aluminum plastic that's similar to the finish on the front panel of to Define S. The texture is subtle, and unless it's in strong light, the front panel looks as black as the rest of the case. A pop-out panel conceals a single 5.25" bay, and some (mostly cosmetic) grates on a pair of chamfers break up the otherwise squarish exterior.
The power and reset buttons are spread across the top edge of the case along with audio jacks and a pair of USB 3.0 ports. That placement is ideal for desktop use, but it might make inserting thumb drives or other removable media difficult in a TV stand. Still, the stealthy exterior of the Core 500 won't draw attention to itself beneath a TV or next to other home theater gear, and it's plenty small enough to sit atop a desk if needed.
Pull off the Core 500's front panel, and you'll see why I called those front vents cosmetic. For all intents and purposes, the case wall behind the front panel is solid, but that' s fine considering the extensive perforations on the Core 500's sides and top. Aside from the 5.25" bay, Fractal includes a 2.5" drive mount here along with a generous cable-routing hole.
Turning the Core 500 around reveals its single Fractal-branded Silent Series R3 140-mm fan. This fan exhausts air from the case and, in so doing, provides the pressure to pull in cool air, too. Builders can swap this fan for a 120-mm radiator, but a 140-mm heat exchanger won't fit. As with many other Mini-ITX cases, the Core 500 offers two expansion card slots. Strangely, Fractal foregoes thumb screws here for a pair of conventional screws that pass through a guillotine-style plate like the one on Corsair's Graphite Series 380T. The design makes sense, but it's less finger-friendly than I'd expect.
Oddly, the Core 500's power supply doesn't live at the rear of the case. Instead, a pass-through power cable connects to the PSU in its home at the front of the case. The socket for that cable can be seen to the left of the motherboard I/O cutout. From this angle, we can also see the PSU's exhaust vent.
The case rests on four thick rubber feet that should lessen any stray vibrations trying to pass through to the desk or floor beneath. The PSU breathes through a filtered intake on the bottom of the case. Unfortunately, this filter can't be pulled out from the front, so the Core 500 has to be flipped in order to clean off any dust bunnies.
At 9.8" wide by 8" tall by 14.4" long (250 x 213 x 380 mm), the Core 500 isn't the tiniest Mini-ITX case I've ever tested—that honor still goes to Cooler Master's Elite 110. Fractal Design puts the extra volume to good use, though: this case can swallow air coolers up to 6.7" (170 mm) tall and graphics cards up to 12.2" (310 mm) long. That's enough space to build a powerful shoebox system that could rival much larger PCs, so long as a single graphics card is all one needs.
Fractal hasn't skimped on room for storage inside, either. Up to three 3.5" and three 2.5" drives can live together inside the Core 500 at once, which seems like plenty for all but the most data-deluged out there given today's mechanical storage densities.
The Core 500's 9.7-pound (4.4 kg) heft belies the fact that Fractal didn't skimp on the build-quality front, either. The thick steel top cover is reassuringly rigid, and I didn't note a bit of flex in the case's steel frame, either. That solidity is welcome since the Core 500 costs $60 at Newegg right now.
Here are the Core 500's specs in tabular form for convenient cross-referencing with our other case reviews:

10 Easiest Ways to Insult Someone in Their Own Country
Every country and every nation have its own customs according to their own tradition. In some cases they are very different from our own. If for any weird reason you feel the need to insult someone in their own country, than, all you have to do is follow these “advices”…
Thumbs Up
If you find yourself in Iran or in any other Arab country and you want to approve something by raising your thumbs up, the chances are somebody is going to get angry really soon. This gesture is the same as showing your middle finger.
Business Cards
If a Japanese person gives you a business card and you immediately put it your pocket, then you have already thrown a great insult. In Japan they handle all business cards with great care and attention.
Giving Compliments
When you tell your host in any Arab or North African country that you like their couch, or any other item, they will immediately feel an obligation to give it to you as a gift. (Don`t abuse this one 🙂 )
Drinking
While drinking alcohol in Japan, it's considered rude (greedy and self centered) to pour your own glass. When your glass is empty you should pour for others first (usually the person sitting next to you).
Running Late
If you have a dinner appointment in Argentina, showing on time would be considered rude. That would send a message that you are a greedy person. So, showing an hour late is the right thing to do.
Sipping
In western civilization sipping loudly while eating is considered inappropriate. But if you don't do exactly that in Japan, that would mean you don`t like the food.
Laughing
In Korea when you laugh at someone you don't know, it usually means that you think they are stupid.
OK
The OK gesture by hand in Brazil or Turkey is considered quite rude. It signifies a woman's behind.
Calling someone with your finger
In the Philippines when you call someone using your index finger, it`s the same as calling them a dog. It`s not only an insult but it`s something that can get you arrested.
For all of the attention paid to the Republican primary -- thanks in large part to the classy marquee name of Donald Trump -- it's worth pointing something out: More Americans currently support Hillary Clinton than Trump, which you probably already knew. But it's safe to assume that more Americans also support Bernie Sanders.
We looked at this a bit back in May, when the Sanders phenomenon was first emerging. But it's worth revisiting now that they have surged.
If you extrapolate Census turnout estimates into 2016, we can figure that some 137 million will turn out to vote next year. That's maybe a bit high, but it doesn't really matter. It gives us a figure to work with.
In September, Gallup did its regular assessment of how Americans identify politically. The number who said they were Democrats or Republicans was the same, 27 percent. The rest were "independents," though a number of those independents leaned toward one party or the other. (This is not uncommon at all.)
Those partisanship figures change a lot, but let's use them as-is. If we apply those percentages to the 137 million people that vote, assuming (unfairly) that partisans vote at even rates, we get about 37 million people in each party, about 25 million Republican-leaning independents and about 23 million Democratic-leaning ones.
If we then apply polling averages to those numbers, we get a look at how many people (generally) support each candidate. Note that the ratios below don't change even if the numbers of voters change; it's a percent of a percent. But the upshot is this: More Americans support Sanders than Trump.
There are other surprises: More Americans support Jim Webb than Rick Santorum! More Americans support Lindsey Graham than Martin O'Malley!
This is not hard-and-fast and relies on numbers that have a decent margin of error. But we can also simplify the argument. About half the country is Democratic and about half is Republican. Sanders gets about 25.1 percent of Democratic voters; Trump gets 23.7 percent of Republican ones. Ergo: America is Bernie Country more than it is Trumpland.

Eduardo Oliferr notified me that Christopher Tolkien resigned as an officer of the Tolkien Estate effective August 29, 2017. You can confirm this for yourself by reviewing the Estate's list of officers. The termination of their position with the Tolkien Estate was registered on September 4.
Tolkien Brasil published what they know about the transition in leadership in this article. If you need to read an English translation of the page you can use this link, but the translation is not 100% accurate.
According to Eduardo (I have not had time to look into this), the agreement reached by the Tolkien Estate with Warner Bros. (announced on June 29) may have stipulated they could or would work together in the future.
Tolkien fans have been sharing many news stories on social media and I am not going to track them all in this post. But I did read in one story from November 3 that the Tolkien Estate allegedly approached Netflix and HBO as well as Amazon. Hence, although The Atlantic speculates that Amazon is willing to pay out as much as half a billion dollars in advance on a bet that producing Middle-earth fan fiction will win for them, the high price tag could also be the result of a must-win auction.
With Christopher's departure as an officer of the Tolkien Estate (which was incorporated in 2011), the long-awaited “rights frenzy” for Tolkien properties may soon begin. Early reports indicate that the first Amazon television series will probably be set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings; I don't know how much of this is still speculation.
What many fans want to know is if or when an adaptation of The Silmarillion will be produced, by whom, and in what medium. It could be done as a single movie in the same style in which John Huston produced their 1966 epic movie, “The Bible: In the Beginning…”; although they only covered the first part of Genesis in that movie, it consisted of several vignettes. Some fans are hoping only for adaptations of the stories of “Beren and Luthien” and “The Children of Hurin”.
Honestly, you could take just about any 1 sentence anecdote from the thousands of pages of Tolkien's published notes and stories and turn that into a full multi-season television show. Amazon doesn't need to have rights to everything in the Tolkien arcana to milk this material for decades. They just need the appendices and creative license to “fill in the gaps”.

Deir Yassin (Arabic: دير ياسين‎, Dayr Yāsīn) was a Palestinian Arab village of around 600 inhabitants about 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) west of Jerusalem. Deir Yassin declared its neutrality during the 1948 Palestine war between Arabs and Jews. The village was razed after a massacre of around 107 of its residents on April 9, 1948, by the Jewish paramilitary groups Irgun and Lehi. The village buildings are today part of the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center, an Israeli public psychiatric hospital.
History [ edit ]
The first part of the village's name Deir is defined as "monastery" in Arabic. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, this was a common occurrence in Palestinian village names especially those so close to Jerusalem. A large ruin that lay at the southwestern edge of Deir Yassin was known simply as "Deir".[4]
Deir Yassin has been identified as one of the villages given as a fief to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the 12th century,[5] and it has been suggested that a vaulted building in the center of the village could have been of Crusader or Mamluk origin.[6]
Ottoman rule [ edit ]
During the Ottoman era, which began in 1517, the nucleus of settlement activity in the area was Khirbet Ayn al-Tut ("The Ruin of the Mulberry Spring")—some 500 meters (1,600 ft) west of the 1948 village site. In 1596, this village was under the administration of the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jerusalem, part of the sanjak (district) of Jerusalem. It paid taxes on wheat, barley, and olive trees.[4][7]
The inauguration of a hospital in Deir Yassin, 1914
It is unknown precisely when settlement shifted to Deir Yassin. The village was named in honor of a certain Sheikh Yassin whose tomb was in a mosque, or shrine located just outside the village,[4] on a high spot, dominating the surrounding area.[8] The village guesthouse, or Madafeh, was located opposite the shrine.[9]
Edward Robinson noted the village in 1838,[10] and by 1870, an Ottoman village list indicated 13 houses and a population of 48, though the list only counted men.[11][12] In 1896 the population of Der jasin was estimated to be about 138 persons.[13]
In the late 19th century, the houses of Deir Yassin were built of stone. Two springs—one located in the north and another in the south—supplied water to the village.[14] Most of its houses, strongly built with thick walls, were clustered in a small area known as the Hara meaning "Quarter" or "Neighborhood". All residents were Muslims. In 1906, a Jewish suburb of Jerusalem, Givat Shaul, was built across the valley from Deir Yassin. The secondary road linking the village to Jerusalem and the road to Jaffa ran through the suburb.[4]
Deir Yassin in the 1930s
During World War I, the Ottomans fortified the hilltop of Deir Yassin as part of the defense system of Jerusalem, but on December 8, 1917, these fortifications were stormed by the Allied Forces under Edmund Allenby. The following day Jerusalem fell to the British. Until the 1920s, Deir Yassin's inhabitants mostly depended on agriculture and livestock for income, but the extensive building projects in Jerusalem in the British Mandate period transformed the basis of its economy.[4]
Deir Yassin's prospered from mining, its main source of employment. A rich vein of hard yellow limestone, known as mizi yahudi was prized for its resistance to the rigors of Jerusalem's climate. The quarry (hajar yasinik or "Yasin's stone") supplied the Jerusalem market, and the wealth allowed the village to develop spacious housing, two elementary schools and mosques.[15] By the late 1940s, there were four stone crushers functioning in the village. The business encouraged the wealthier inhabitants to invest in trucking while others became truck drivers. In 1935, a local bus company was established in a joint venture with the neighboring Arab village of Lifta. As Deir Yassin prospered, houses radiated from the Hara uphill and eastward, towards Jerusalem.[4]
Family from Deir Yassin, 1927.
In the early days of the British Mandate, Deir Yassin had no school of its own and its children attended the school at Lifta or in Qalunya. By 1943, two elementary schools were built—one for boys and one for girls. The girls' school had a resident principal from Jerusalem. At that time, Deir Yassin also had a bakery, two guesthouses, and a social club—the "Renaissance Club", a thrift fund, three shops, four wells and a second mosque built by Mahmud Salah, an affluent resident. Many inhabitants were employed outside the village in the nearby British Army camps as waiters, carpenters, and supervisors; others as clerks and teachers in the mandatory civil service. By this time, no more than 15% of the population was engaged in agriculture.[16]
Relations between Deir Yassin and its Jewish neighbors had started reasonably well under the Ottomans, particularly early on when Arabic-speaking Sephardic Yemenite Jews comprised much of the surrounding population. Relations rapidly deteriorated with the growth of Zionism in Palestine and reached their apex during the Arab revolt in 1936-1939. Relations picked up again during the economic boom years of full employment of World War II. Thus, in 1948, Deir Yassin was a prosperous, expanding village at relative peace with its Jewish neighbors with whom much business was done.[16]
April 1948 invasion [ edit ]
When hostilities erupted in 1948, the villagers of Deir Yassin and those of the nearby Jewish village of Giv'at Shaul signed a pact, later approved at Haganah headquarters, to maintain their good relations, exchange information on movement of outsiders through village territory, and ensure the safety of vehicles from the village. The inhabitants of Deir Yassin upheld the agreement scrupulously, resisting infiltration by Arab irregulars. Though this was known to the Irgun and Lehi forces, they attacked the village on April 9, 1948. The assault was beaten off initially, with the attackers suffering 40 wounded. Only the intervention of a Palmach unit, using mortars,[16] allowed them to conquer the village. Houses were blown up with people inside and people shot: 107 villagers, including women and children, were killed. The survivors were loaded on trucks that were driven through Jerusalem in a victory parade,[15][17] with some sources describing further violence by Lehi soldiers.[18] Four Irgun or Lehi men were killed.[19] The incident became known as the Deir Yassin massacre.
On April 10, 1948, one day after the Deir Yassin massacre, Albert Einstein wrote a critical letter to the American Friends of Fighters for the Freedom of Israel (the U.S chapter of the Stern gang) refusing to assist them with aid or support to raise money for their cause in Palestine.[20][21] On December 2, 1948, many prominent American Jews signed and published an op-ed article in The New York Times critical of Menachem Begin and the massacre at Deir Yassin.[22]
Following the war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. A year later, the Jewish neighborhood of Givat Shaul Bet was built on Deir Yassin's land, despite Israeli scholars' protests to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.[23] In 1951, the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center was built within the village itself, using some abandoned village buildings themselves.[24] In 1980, the remaining ruins of the village were bulldozed to clear the ground for new Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. In the early 1980s, most of the Deir Yassin cemetery was bulldozed and a new highway to Givat Shaul Bet was paved in its place.
In 1992, Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi wrote:
Many of the village houses on the hill are still standing and have been incorporated into an Israeli hospital for the mentally ill that was established on the site. Some houses outside the fence of the hospital grounds are used for residential and commercial purposes, or as warehouses. Outside the fence, there are carob and almond trees and the stumps of olive trees. Several wells are located at the southwestern edge of the site. The old village cemetery, southeast of the site, is unkempt and threatened by debris from a ring road that has been constructed around the village hill. One tall cypress tree still stands at the center of the cemetery.[25]
The killings at Deir Yassin are regarded as one of two pivotal events that led to the exodus of around 700,000 Palestinians from their towns and villages in 1948, along with the defeat of the Palestinians in Haifa. News of the killings, amplified by Arab media broadcasts of atrocity, triggered fear and panic among Palestinians, who in turn increasingly evacuated their homes.[26]
Geography [ edit ]
Map showing Deir Yassin in relation to Jerusalem in the 1870s
Deir Yassin was built on the eastern slopes of a hill, with an elevation of roughly 800 meters (2,600 ft) above sea level and commanding a wide view all around it. The village faced the western suburbs of Jerusalem which were 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) away. The city center of Jerusalem was about 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) to the east. It was separated from the city by a terraced valley planted with fig, almond, and olive orchards. Along the northern rim of the valley ran a secondary road linking Deir Yassin to the suburbs and to the main Jaffa Road which was about 2 kilometers (1.2 mi) to the north.[4]
The total land area of the village consisted of 2,857 dunams (286 hectares), of which 94.5% was Arab-owned, 5.3% was Jewish-owned and the remainder was public property.[27] Cultivable land amounted to a total of 866 dunams (30%) (87 hectares), all of which was grown with grains and owned mostly by Arabs.[28] The built-up area of the village was 12 dunams.[29]

Demographics [ edit ]
Khirbet Ayn al-Tut had a population of 39 in 1596, during early Ottoman rule.[4] In the 1922 British Mandate census, Deir Yassin had a population of 254.[30] Its population had increased from 429 in the 1931 census to 750 in 1948 and its houses from 91 in the former year to 144 in the latter.[16][31] Before its ravage in 1948, it is estimated that Deir Yassin had 610 Muslim inhabitants in the 1945 statistics.[27][2] The five hamulas (clans) of Deir Yassin were the Shahada, 'Aql, Hamidad, Jabir and Jundi.[32]

One of Bill Clinton's China scandals may finally be coming to closure. In 1998, the New York Times' Jeff Gerth broke a story about the Clinton administration's willingness to permit two U.S. aerospace corporations to transfer sensitive missile technology to the Chinese. The CEO of one of the corporations, Loral, had pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign contributions into the Democratic National Committee. In return, the Clinton administration waived controls on Loral's export of these technologies to the Chinese aerospace industry.
Hughes Space and Communications committed similar offenses, but it was shielded from investigation by CIA Director George J. Tenet. Hughes was a key supplier of U.S. intelligence collection satellites, so when suspicions first emerged about its illicit activities, CIA employees tipped off Hughes about the impending federal investigation. Loral admitted its transgressions last year and paid $14 million in fines, but Hughes has continued to insist on its innocence. “We don't believe we've done anything wrong,” Hughes spokespersons told reporters.
But internal Hughes documents show that from 1995 on, the satellite maker gave China sensitive missile technology in order to win contracts in the emerging Chinese space market. The Chinese had demanded such assistance as the price of doing business and especially after they had suffered several catastrophic launch failures. Hughes promised the Chinese “whatever data and resources are required” to improve the reliability of their space launch vehicles. This included technical analyses of launch failures and information on guidance and telemetry systems. Much of the technology and expertise the Chinese gained was also applicable to their strategic nuclear missiles.
Now the U.S. State Department has proposed fines totaling over $60 million and bans on future exports, which could cost the company millions more in lost business. Just before Christmas, the Department charged Hughes, and its parent company Boeing Satellite Systems, with 123 violations of export control and arms transfer regulations. The charges also indicate that Hughes hired the son of a top Chinese aerospace general, who provided insider information on contract bids by one of Hughes' major U.S. competitors.
The announcement also represents vindication for Gerth. They got a Pulitzer for their stories, but they were harshly attacked by the Clinton administration and its allies for reporting on the export control violations. Working through sympathetic journalists at the competing Washington Post, Clinton officials sought to downplay Gerth's revelations and dismiss their significance.
One of Clinton's favorite reporters was Walter Pincus of the Washington Post. Their son was then the General Counsel at the Commerce Department, which had authorized the illegal transfers. Despite the obvious conflict of interest, Pincus repeatedly wrote or contributed to Post stories parroting the Clinton line. Pincus did not write the recent story about the Hughes' fines.
Gary Johnson admitted to being an idiot in a video interview with the Guardian published on Thursday.
"I am an idiot," said the Libertarian presidential nominee early in their exchange with Paul Lewis, a reporter for the British newspaper. "I am the dumbest guy you've ever met in your whole life."
In the course of the five and a half minute video exchange, Johnson also acknowledged that they are "human" and claimed that their campaign is "phenomenal."
"Why are you even interviewing me?" they asked halfway through the exchange.
Johnson also suggested that Evan McMullin, an independent conservative candidate, is "ensuring that Hillary Clinton will win Utah" and discussed the possibility of wielding "a magic wand" that would allow them to eliminate most forms of taxation.
When pressed by Lewis about the fact that economists do not generally favor the abolition of the income tax, Johnson mentioned their support for the legalization of marijuana.
"But what's that got to do with your tax policy?" Lewis asked.
"It's leadership," Johnson said.
Before the interview began, Johnson shouted at an employee of HBO and discussed the possibility that they might "blow [his] brains out."

WASHINGTON — The Senate Budget Committee released the text of the Fiscal Year 2018 budget resolution on Friday, a critical first step for Republicans to move forward with tax reform.
The budget gives Republicans in both the House and the Senate a deadline of Nov. 13 to release legislative text on tax reform. The GOP unveiled a broad outline on taxes this week but still have the difficult work of filling in all the details before it can be voted on.
The Nov. 13 deadline will satisfy anxious Republicans who want to pass tax reform before the end of the year, but it is a different tactic than the party took on health care where leaders were reluctant to set exact deadlines in case it wasn't met.

Without a budget resolution, the Senate would have to pass tax reform with 60 votes. The rules of reconciliation under the budget enable the Senate to move the legislation with a simple majority of 50, meaning that no Democratic support is necessary for it to pass.
The budget resolution allows for a plan that reduces spending by $5 trillion. The Senate Finance Committee is to come up with $1.5 trillion in tax cuts while the the Energy and Natural Resources Committee is directed to find $1 billion of savings.
“This budget resolution puts our nation on a path to balance by restraining federal spending, reducing tax burdens, and boosting economic growth. It is also the first important step in providing Congress with the tools it needs to enact tax reform that will grow America's economy and strengthen hardworking families and small businesses,” Sen. Mike Enzi, R, Wyo., chairperson of the Budget Committee, said in a statement.

CAIRO, Egypt — During the sweaty morning commute through one of Cairo's busiest subway stations, passengers can now find the answers to some of life's thorniest dilemmas.
Al Azhar, the revered 1,000-year-old mosque and college and Egypt's ultimate source of Sunni Islam jurisprudence, has made its scholars available to the masses with a pop-up kiosk next to the turnstiles of Shouhada — “Martyrs” — subway station.
A handful of Muslim clerics huddle with passengers at a table in a windowed kiosk, cooled by a whirring fan, offering religious instructions or "fatwas." Those in a rush grab a quick consultation outside.

Business is brisk — up from 50 visitors a day when the service began three weeks ago to about 150 a day now — and neighborhood couples even drop by to resolve martial disputes.
The pilot project is part of a growing effort by Egypt's President Abdel Fatah al Sisi to counter extremist ideology with modern, moderate discourse in the mosque and on the street.
In recent years, Egypt has been rocked by large scale terrorist attacks on Christians by an ISIS-linked group and is battling radicals in North Sinai. Many believe moderate Islamic opinion can make a difference.
“Imagine liquor, it is banned by Islamic law … but is acceptable when it belongs to non-Muslims. This is just one of many examples where Islam is building a correct and cohesive society … despite people's differences and background,” says Emad Abdel Nabi Mahmoud, an Al Azhar Islamic law professor.
Al Azhar recently initiated an outreach to young men.
“The Grand Sheikh … encouraged scholars and preachers to go out to where the youth are, in coffee shops, forums and institutions,” explains Islamic law expert Fahmy Ragab Mohamed. “Young scholars sat with them … and corrected some of their opinions and thoughts and that is a very good thing.”
Although Mahmoud credits Al Azhar leadership for the outreach initiative, they say the most important thing is “not the motive but the result.”

In the subway, the clerics have not heard any extremist views from visitors. “They would be afraid of saying anything”, acknowledges Sheikh Ali Mostafa, 35, a kind-faced cleric. “The aim is to get closer to the people … gaining confidence, gaining trust.”
They added: “We try to mend the problem by coming to where the people are, to correct their understanding. Our offices are far away [but] here we are accessible to people. We reached the people.”
Subway riders largely agree.
“It's a beautiful project, I got an answer in five minutes,” says Gamal Al Din, a former director of a contracting company.
Fatma, 21, smiles: “I can do it on my way to university.”
Visitors are reluctant to provide names because of the personal nature of their inquiries but most are happy to share their meetings. They ask about marriage, divorce, inheritance and commerce - and one even broaches the taboo subject of atheism.
Yasmin Minutallah, 26, brings a nervous 23-year-old friend who works with them in a customer service job. “She doesn't know whether to believe in god or not,” Minutallah explains. “She is asking god for things and some happen and some don't, even though god is supposed to answer prayers.”
A 32-year-old engineer wants to divorce their new wife, complaining that their parents expect too much from their modest government salary. “They are greedy, although they are good,” they tell the clerics.

They need to know how much to pay for the divorce since they hadn't lived together or consummated the marriage. The clerics urge them to reconcile first, and if that fails, to leave them half of the money and any jewelry they had already given. They privately admitted they agreed with the financial advice but would press ahead with the divorce.
A 45-year-old woman is seeking advice for their husband. Them mother-in-law threatened to cut ties with the husband if they claimed their legal inheritance from their deceased father.
Preacher Sheikh Gamal Abdel 'Al, 39, advises their husband to regain their mother's affection but to claim what is legally his.
Although passengers seem pleased with the on-the-go religious guidance, some analysts feel it will do little to reform religious thought.
“It is a matter of enlightened interpretation rather than opening up a new religious outlet,” says American University of Cairo political science professor, Gamal Abdel Gawad.
“People of religion must be respected. They should be in the proper place and the proper place is not the metro. It is not like selling fast food.”
Even before the #metoo movement went viral last month, a bombshell – or at least a hand grenade – had dropped in the Western Tibetan Buddhist world. In July, 8 former students of Sogyal Lakar (or ‘Rinpoche' to devotees, famed author of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying) co-signed a letter outlining their years of sexual, verbal, and physical abuse. In response, Lakar stepped down, leaving over 100 Rigpa centers that had been under their direction in limbo.
At virtually the same time, Lama Rod Owens, co-author of Radical Dharma: Talking Race, Love, and Liberation, and one of the emerging voices of 21st century American Buddhism, wrote a powerful facebook post (reproduced and discussed here) about discovering that their teacher, Norlha Rinpoche, had abused women followers as well.
Western fascination with Buddhism
For the last sixty-plus years, as Buddhism boomed in the Western world, it developed (mostly) a mystique of all pervasive goodness. In their 1998 book, Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West, professor Donald S. Lopez writes:
Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism have long been objects of Western fantasy. Since the earliest encounters of Venetian travelers and Catholic missionaries with Tibetan monks at the Mongol court, tales of the mysteries of their mountain homeland and the magic of their strange-yet strangely familiar­ religion have had a peculiar hold on the Western imagination. During the last two centuries, the valuation of Tibetan society and, particularly, its religion, has fluctuated wildly. Tibetan Buddhism has been portrayed sometimes as the most corrupt deviation from the Buddha's true dharma, sometimes as its most direct descendant. These fluctuations have occurred over the course of this century, at its beginning as Tibet resisted the colonial ambitions of a Euro­pean power and at its end as it succumbed to the colonial ambitions of an Asian power.
The emergence of the current Dalai Lama, with their broad smile and persistent giggle, tilted perceptions strongly toward the positive. It didn't hurt that they were a refugee of that well-known evil, Maoist Communism, spreading a message of kindness, world peace, and a pro-scientific turn in Buddhism to football stadiums filled with Westerners who had grown tired of both their own religions and capitalism-fueled hedonism. They offered, for those who wished to dig in, a middle way: neither scornfully judgmental of pleasure but also teaching moral responsibility and mental discipline. Those who remained as detractors of Tibetan Buddhism, such as then-Cardinal Ratzinger, were a distinctive minority.
But along with the Dalai Lama came countless other refugees of the red scare: fellow Tibetans, Indian/Hindu teachers, Thich Nhat Hanh from Vietnam, and on, fulfilling many Westerner's romantic needs for an idealized “other”. While the Dalai Lama has been widely loved in the Western world (he did cause ripples and need to change/clarify their views regarding homosexuality in the late 90s and after), several Tibetan Buddhists – both those from Tibet and Western converts who have risen to the status of teacher – have been at the heart of scandals.
Several of these are documented in Anna Sawerthal's timely article, “Abuse and Buddhism: Behind the Smiling Façade.” One of those was a “Belgian man named Robert S., who dressed in Tibetan monk's robes and took up a new name in 1972: Lama Ogyen Kunzang Dorje,” who founded a community called Nyima Dzong where they allegedly repeatedly abused young girls.
In Nyima Dzong, people were indoctrinated to see everything in a positive light. Negative thoughts were said to be signs of a clouded mind. Only Robert S. allegedly had access to ‘true reality'. They quoted Tibetan teachers with whom they had supposedly studied in India. And various Tibetan teachers made them seem legitimate by visiting the OKC over the years, for example the Dalai Lama in 1990. By that time, many instances of sexual abuse had apparently already occurred.
Sawerthal continues, saying that this is not an isolated case.
One might think that allegations surrounding OKC constitute a horrible exception, a monument to the failure of entire institutions: family, friends, or the justice system. However, the OKC is unfortunately only an extreme example of a larger problem that has gone essentially unnoticed: abuse in the name of Buddhism. Just off the top of their head, Tenzin Peljor can name nine recent cases in Europe. Born in Germany as Michael Jäckel, Peljor became a Tibetan Buddhist monk in 1998. They say that they initially ended up in a Buddhist cult himself. After a four-year struggle to get out, they have since dedicated themselves to promoting an open discussion about similar problems in other Buddhist communities. Three of the groups they can point to are in Germany. Rob Hogendoorn, a Dutch publicist and long-time Buddhist, is currently following some twenty cases in which Buddhist teachers in the Netherlands have been accused of sexually abusing their students. The country has 39 recognised Buddhist organisations; they claim to have received complaints about almost half of them. (Abuse and Buddhism)
Some of my background
My own exposure to questionable and/or troubled groups is similar. I first started practicing and studying with ordained members of the FWBO (now TBO), which had weathered ongoing controversies around their leader, Sangharakshita's, unorthodox sexual teachings and allegations of abuse. Though I didn't experience any problems directly, having seen the allegations and ongoing controversies regarding the lack of resolution, I decided to keep my distance. I later stumbled across “Geshe” Michael Roach online and spent months absorbing their teachings on Tibetan Buddhism, even traveling with friends from the UK to Ireland in 2005 when they taught there, and later spending time with their students in Arizona when the Dalai Lama visited the same year. Similarly, while my experiences of them and their students were generally good, I found web resources pointing out flaws in Roach's behavior and their background that gave me enough reason to step away from their teachings. While in the UK, I dropped in on a “New Kadampa” center for a teaching, but never went beyond that. One of the most-visited pages on this blog is a 2011 post discussing the New Kadampa tradition and the “survivors group” that formed to help ex-members reintegrate into society.
How big is the problem?
These and other experiences have led me to be quite weary of Buddhist groups (Tibetan and others, Zen has not been without scandals in recent years and at least a couple cases of teacher misconduct have arisen in Theravadin communities). Yet it would not be fair to suggest that all, or even a majority of Buddhist groups have abusive leadership.
One major investigation in Australia's Catholic Church found that 7% of Priests sexually abused children in the past. In the Boston Globe investigation in the early 2000s, dramatized in the movie Spotlight, the same number was given. There is no reason to believe the problem is Catholicism's alone; several studies show an equal if not larger problem in Protestant Christianity and organizations such as An Olive Branch suggest that this is no less a problem in Buddhism. Predators will be drawn to positions of power.
This is a low number if you are a gambling person walking into any given Buddhist center. However, when you consider the thousands of Buddhist teachers spread across the West, 7% means that there are likely hundreds who have used or continue to use their positions of authority to abuse students.
Buddhist scholar Bernard Faure recounts several of the scandals of Western Buddhism in their book on Buddhist sexuality, The Red Thread, but then warns us, “The problem is by no means limited to Western interpretations of Mahāyāna: it is also found in Asian forms of Mahāyāna and Theravāda… [F]ar from being mere accidents due to individual personalities, [the scandals] may also be seen as structural problems, having deeper social, psychological, and cultural roots. These behaviors found some doctrinal justification in the teachings of Mahāyāna or Great Vehicle— particularly in its most radical versions,Vajrayāna and Chan/Zen.”
What Next?
The current debate has been framed at times as one of a clash of cultures and value sets. The Dalai Lama gave the analogy of the French Revolution, saying sometimes religious institutions become “frankly, rotten” and that it's therefore worthwhile to be against them. Speaking of Sogyal, they said that they are a disgrace who has used “religion as an instrument for exploitation.” The Dalai Lama spoke out earlier about Sogyal as well, urging students to publicize any misconduct by a teacher by whatever means they can.
Lama Rod Owens and Justin Von Bujdoss (Repa Dorje Odzer) spoke publicly in August, drawing connections between the patriarchy and abuse in Tibetan Buddhism and the events in Charlottesville.
On the other hand, Dzongsar Khyentse Norbu, a Bhutanese Buddhist teacher and moviemaker, used the accusations against Sogyal Lakar as an opportunity to lambast Western media and values and question the intelligence of the accusers. They went on to praise so-called “crazy wisdom” methods of teaching employed by Tilopa, Chogyam Trungpa, and Sogyal Lakar. However, scholars and long-time practitioners of Vajrayana debate the appropriateness of “crazy wisdom” as a term used for sexual predation by teachers. And as they draw Lakar and Trungpa together, it is worth noting the other side of their actions, likened by some to a dysfunctional family:
Oane [one of Lakar's former students] sums up the Rigpa's inner circle with a bitter comparison: “It is like a dysfunctional, incestuous family with grave sado-masochistic tendencies, but without a safeword.” (Abuse and Buddhism)
and:
I found especially interesting the dynamics between the Tibetan lama, Trungpa Rinpoche, and their American students, all brimming with devotion and lacking in personal authority, and the parallel with dysfunctional family systems. Trungpa Rinpoche appears as a drunken, crazy surrogate for the dysfunctional families of the authors. The ploys used to keep the power differential operating in the community of Rinpoche's followers mimic the betrayal and required secrets in the alcoholic family. (from here)
Of course, to some followers, all of this could be perfectly true and it could still be the expression of a perfectly enlightened being.
This is perhaps one of the most frustrating aspects of contemporary Tibetan Buddhism. And it does seem to be squarely at odds with Western culture, perhaps not the culture of the 1960s Catholic Church or other secretive patriarchal institutions, but rather with the growing culture of openness and gender inclusivity.
The Dalai Lama has embraced the fight for greater inclusivity, the Karmapa as well, as have a growing number of younger teachers, including many women. It is not clear to me what we might lose by giving up patriarchy and secrecy, but I think we gain immensely by listening honestly to victims, removing shrouds of secrecy, and punishing the men who have used the Dharma “as an instrument for exploitation” (to quote the Dalai Lama).
Just how this fight plays out will go a great distance toward shaping the future of Tibetan (and other) Buddhism in the world.

The principal of the British school ranked top in the world in the international baccalaureate diploma has launched a passionate attack on Michael Gove's education reforms. Tricia Kelleher accused the education secretary of "pressing the rewind button" and warned that attempts to chase global education-league rankings will lead schools into a creativity-free "cul-de-sac" of learning.
The head of the independent Stephen Perse Foundation in Cambridge said Gove was living in a parallel universe in which they bulldozed through reforms to qualifications and failed to recognise the importance of learning itself, including the role of new digital technologies in the classroom.
Stephen Perse equips each secondary-age pupil with an iPad and is working with Apple to publish its own curriculum apps. It is also contemplating abandoning handwriting in favour of screen-only working.
Kelleher rejected Gove's recent ridiculing of the use of popular cultural references, such as Mr Men and Disney, as learning tools: "Why not, if they contribute to understanding and learning?"
They said modern pupils had a hugely varied cultural landscape. "I think the sober study of classic literature and dry narrative history do not register highly. Young people need an approach which connects with them and the values in their world."
Kelleher's criticisms come just days after the principal of Eton college, Tony Little, warned that a relentless focus on exams and assessment targets in schools risks turning teachers into "functionaries in a service industry". They had never seen a generation of teachers who defined "their purpose as teachers in such a limited way".
Calls from the private sector – unbound by the national curriculum and other restrictions affecting state-sector colleagues – for less central intervention and greater trust in teachers' professionalism come against a backdrop of continuing, far-reaching educational reform. Gove is pushing through a programme combining structural change – creating academies and free schools – sweeping qualification reform and revision of the national curriculum.
Focus on the UK's education performance was renewed last week as the latest Programme for International Student Achievement (Pisa), published by the OECD, showed Britain languishing mid-table in reading, maths and science tests taken by 15-year-olds. The league table, whose UK results reflect the performance of children educated mainly under the last Labour government, was topped by east Asian countries, including China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.
Kelleher, whose school recorded the joint top score worldwide in the international baccalaureate diploma in the Sunday Times table published last month, urged Gove not to narrow education goals to the pursuit of Pisa scores: "My worry is we are now going to be driven towards Pisa because Pisa becomes the next altar we worship at. But it is really a cul-de-sac in learning terms."
They said Pisa took no account of individual countries' cultural differences, including the unrelenting pressure on pupils in top-performing countries, nor did they recognise the creativity of British learning. "If Michael Gove is saying we should just value what is in Pisa, then we might as well just collapse the curriculum and teach what will come top."
Acknowledging the privileged position of their £5,000-a-term selective school, many of whose pupils are the children of Cambridge academics, Kelleher insisted that an approach focusing on sparking the imaginations of children applied across the schools landscape.
In a recent personal blogpost – they also blog for the Guardian – Kelleher cited their own experience as a 13-year-old, when a BBC mini-series of War and Peace inspired them to read Tolstoy's epic work, awakening a life-long love of history. "I am sure Gove would approve of such cultural aspiration from a working-class daughter of Irish immigrants, yet I should never have even considered reading such a vast tome without the stimulus of the TV series," they wrote. "Just as the medium of television opened up the world of Tolstoy to me, today television is just one of a multitude of possibilities for engaging the young."
Gove's dismissal of "low-brow" cultural references missed the point, they argued. "The digital world is a game-changer, and we must change with it. If Angry Birds, the staple digital game of many youngsters, inspires a young person to learn coding, surely that is a desirable outcome?
"If the GarageBand app provides a creative platform for an aspiring young musician, isn't this to be applauded? We are on the nursery slopes of digital learning. The potential for transformation of the conventional educational paradigm is extraordinary. Yet none of this registers in the world of the secretary of state for education. It strikes me that Gove's well-meaning attempt to promote excellence for all young people is being enacted in a parallel universe."
Angry Birds had not featured on their curriculum, Kelleher said, though pupils were queuing up to learn computer coding in other ways. But music teaching included the use of GarageBand to enable non-musicians to arrange music. The school also encouraged pupils to submit some homework as films, and teachers gave some feedback via audio rather than writing, while geography course materials were all screen-based.
Handwriting would be maintained while exam boards continued to require it, but its use would be reassessed if that changed.
Kelleher added their voice to concerns over the revised history curriculum, which will focus on a chronological account of Britain's "island story".
"Imagine if you taught children history without Mandela, for example. Of course we should understand what happened in this country, because it is part of the cultural core that brings us together, but not to be looking around the world is just foolhardy. Our children are global citizens.
"Michael Gove is looking back to the past: they are hitting the rewind button because they say that is raising standards. But it should be about improving learning."
A Department for Education spokesperson said: "The simple fact is our education system is not keeping up with the rest of the world. Our reforms will reverse this situation and give our young people the best chance of success.
"Through academies and free schools we are giving thousands of brilliant heads and teachers the freedom to innovate on their curriculums and teach in more creative ways than ever to inspire their pupils.
"We are reforming teacher training to attract the brightest, most innovative graduates, ending grade inflation and introducing demanding qualifications which match the world's best."

It really didn't have to be this way.
Stannis Baratheon, grammar pedant and genuinely loving dad, was on a good run for the first half of this Game of Thrones season—which, in Westeros, obviously meant they were headed for downfall. It was hard to love Stannis for most of their time on-screen, what, with all the brother-murdering, daughter-neglecting, innocents-burning, and endless scowling. But as more and more heroes fell, and as the North became dominated by White Walkers on one side and Ramsay Bolton on another, Stannis became a force of . . . not quite good, exactly, but at least the man had a code.
More accurately, they had two codes—the one that made them a calculating and efficient leader, and the one Melisandre preached about Lord of Light, and it was when they gave in to the latter that everything fell apart in what felt like no time. The speed at which each season of Game of Thrones must tell each story is understandable, but it made Stannis's downfall particularly abrupt, going from calm-headed decisions about marching before winter strikes to sacrificing their only daughter in a few short scenes. We knew Stannis would do the terrible things that Melisandre instructed, which made Shireen's potential death loom in the back of our minds all season. But whatever rationalization they made in their mind to go from military commander to religious zealot was, with few exceptions, kept largely away from us.
From the moment the season finale began, Stannis's doom was clear—another expedient way to knock out their story line early in the episode and move on to other horrors. It was a small, righteous pleasure to see Brienne execute Stannis, but also a shadow of the moral conflict that could have been if we were allowed to still be on Stannis's side. We saw at the end of last season what fascinating drama can result when two people we like square off—why not let that happen again? One of Game of Thrones' many magic tricks over the years has been allowing our opinions on characters to evolve, seeing the goodness in killers and the darkness of girl heros; Stannis experienced one of the most fascinating of those evolutions, only to toss it all away in the 11th hour at the service of . . . a quicker ending? Brienne's justice? Getting Melisandre back to the Wall in time to revive Jon Snow?
Stannis was an emblem of the old world that the White Walkers are now poised to wipe out—he was playing the Game of Thrones while the world teetered on an apocalypse that would make it all irrelevant. As the events of “Hardhome” made it clear, no one as stubborn and unadaptable as Stannis was going to last long. But it was unfair to this brilliant and resilient leader to make them write their death warrant so abruptly, to skip so many steps that led to their single fatal mistake. Their agony in watching their daughter burn didn't make the decision any more explicable; their army's defeat against the Boltons only made their death more pointless and cruel. We still don't even know if it was Shireen's sacrifice that actually melted the snow; we may only find out if Melisandre really does manage to revive Jon from the dead, a redemption for the character associated with House Baratheon who probably deserved it least.
Game of Thrones had trouble trying to move too fast through a lot of plots this season—everything in Dorne, Sansa's marriage to Ramsay, the mutiny at the Wall—but all of those stories have room to make good next season. Stannis, and essentially all of House Baratheon, is gone, leaving basically no one in Westeros to keep the old world intact. They deserved more time to properly orchestrate their own downfall, or they deserved to fend off the White Walkers, or they deserved to realize the error of Melisandre's guidance. Whatever it was, they deserved better than what they got.
Businesses across Canada, especially smaller companies, are scrambling to prepare for Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation, which comes into effect less than four weeks from now on July 1. Some say they simply won't be ready.
"We have to take action straight away," said Carol Sebert, principal at Creative Matters, a small carpet and rug design firm in Toronto. "Because the program we use right now, I can only send that email up to July 1."
That's how we generate business. I do have this company of 12 people, but I can't fly people all over the country to remind people that we exist. — Carol Sebert, principal, Creative Matters
The new law prevents businesses from sending commercial electronic messages — emails, texts or even social media messages — to Canadians without their consent. It's among the toughest of such laws in the world, with penalties up to $1 million for an individual violator and up to $10 million for a company that violates the legislation.
Sebert's company sends out an electronic newsletter about twice a month.
"That's a large part of our business," said Sebert, "We're sending a lot of images all the time to show past projects and just to remind them that we exist and this is what we do."
"That's how we generate business. I do have this company of 12 people, but I can't fly people all over the country to remind people that we exist. That's expensive."
Anti-spam law a surprise
Sebert was not aware of the legislation or the impending deadline until contacted by CBC News.
 They are now learning as much as they can about the legislation and says it will have a dramatic effect on their company.
To begin with, they will have to obtain express consent from just about everyone on their mailing list in order to continue sending them emails.
But with email recipients all over the world, first they have to figure out which ones are in Canada.
"To write to all our Canadian clients and ask them to check off if they want to stay subscribed, well let's face it, a lot of people don't open it. Or they might not open it this month, they might open it next month," Sebert said.
"And we don't have very much time, do we?"
Confusion over legislation
So much confusion and fear exists over the legislation that some firms are now offering to help companies like Sebert's prepare for the anti-spam law.
Elite Email, which makes marketing software and email newsletters, has put out a CASL Survival Guide.
"Businesses must adapt now and many organizations are not ready. They simply don't know how to prepare," says Elite Email president Robert Burko in a press release.
Elite says their online guide outlines the regulations, timing, requirements, penalties and exemptions contained within the anti-spam law. It says its guide also helps organizations identify whether or not they have proper consent to continue to communicate electronically, and if not, how to gain that consent prior to the July 1 deadline.
2 types of consent
There are two types of consent defined under the legislation: implied and express.
Consent can be implied in some cases where a previous relationship exists. It can include an exchange of business cards, sign up forms where no consent is asked, or verbal requests either in person or over the phone.
Obtaining express consent can be more onerous, says David Schnurr, a partner with the law firm Miller Thomson.
"It has to be a form of consent that includes your identifying information, a clearly defined purpose for which you are requesting the consent, as well as your full contact information." Schnurr said.
"Express consent requests have to be sent out to any individual or organization where you can't fall back on another exemption or implied consent."
Schnurr's firm is holding complimentary breakfast and information sessions on the anti-spam law across the country, leading up to July 1.
"We're noticing there is a strong contingent of our clients that are unprepared or unaware of the legislation and its reach." Schnurr said.
David Fraser, a Nova Scotia lawyer who has studied the anti-spam law, said the legislation should be scrapped.
Fraser told CBC News earlier this spring, "The problem of spam has by and large actually been dealt with via spamfilters, kind of better technology and things like that," they said.
For millions of Canadian internet users, the law should provide them with greater control over their in-boxes — Michael Geist, Canada research chair in internet and e-commerce law
"I think ultimately it's not going to have a big impact on the consumer because the consumer is still going to continue to receive Nigerian fraud inheritance scams and things like that, because this legislation, while it purports to regulate people outside of Canada, they're going to have a very hard time doing that," they said.
Privacy concerns
Michael Geist, Canada research chair in internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa, defends the legislation.
In a blog post on their website, Geist said, "For millions of Canadian internet users, the law should provide them with greater control over their inboxes."
"The law," Geist writes, "is unlikely to eliminate all spam — no law can single-handedly accomplish that — but with several large Canadian-based spamming organizations operating within the country, enforcement agencies will now have the tools to bring legal actions that could yield multi-million dollar fines and grind spamming activities to a halt."
In a statement e-mailed to CBC News today, a spokesperson for Industry Canada said "These changes will protect consumers from spam and other threats that lead to harassment, identity theft and fraud, and every step has been taken to limit the impact on Canadian businesses."
Big cost for small business
For a small company like Sebert's Creative Matters, with just 12 employees, changing their software, obtaining consent from hundreds of clients and complying with the legislation comes with a significant cost.
"I gotta pay somebody to do that. Now that's going to be expensive too. There's a big cost to that. I could see that being weeks and weeks of work. And I don't have somebody for that."
Sebert says they don't understand why any of this is necessary when people can simply click on the unsubscribe link in their emails.
There's a big cost to that. I could see that being weeks and weeks of work. — Carol Sebert on complying with Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation
"If there's the opportunity to take your name off a list, I don't understand why we've got to go through this rigmarole to make sure that people are willing to be on a list."
"We have a Conservative government that's pro-business and this seems really against business. Unless they're going for the big guys that are destroying computer systems, I understand that. But [for] a little business like Creative Matters [it] seems ridiculous."

With so many products we can help you find the right one for you
Most environmentally aware Americans would love a personal organic vegetable garden, but how many people actually have the time to cultivate one?. Thanks to a San Francisco-based company called MyFarm, Bay Area denizens can pay a weekly fee to have a backyard garden designed and maintained by professionals.
Customers choose between a Personal Installation (just enough food for themselves) and an Owner Member Installation (enough food for MyFarm to sell to other members). Owner members receive a discounted membership.
The company leaves no gardening detail ignored. Each garden is tested for toxins and receives a drip irrigation system to automatically water the vegetables. MyFarm even maintains a compost pile and takes care of all pesky weeds that arise.
MyFarm founder Trevor Paque envisions a decentralized urban farm in San Francisco, made up of a network of organic urban vegetable gardens where clients in sunny areas grow tomatoes for those in foggier areas, and those in the foggy parts of town grow broccoli and other cool-weather veggies for those in warmer climes.
Paque and their crew do all work by hand and follow permaculture farming principles to ensure the long-term sustainability of each garden. Sample garden produce includes artichokes, spinach, squash, sweet peppers, carrots, and peas.
While some people may protest that a service such as MyFarm downplays the importance of individual farming and gardening skills, I believe that this is an important step in creating a local food economy. After all, in today's era of high food and gas prices, shouldn't we welcome a service that wants to provide high-quality produce close to home?
The fundamentals of building campsites and player customization are what this week's update is all about: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rgX-S4LTsc&hd=1
Customization will be a very big part of the game. Your hunter, your mounts, your campsite- prepare to bedazzle!
As mentioned in the video, the totem is a very important component to every tribe, even if you're solo. Here is a longer list of details about the totem:
The totem is the tribe's icon of power, it starts at zero and is upgraded by sacrificing dinosaur meat to the totem.
Each totem tier gives the tribe increased abilities.
There can only be 1 totem per tribe(if there are 3 players in a server, and they each make a totem, they establish 3 separate tribes)
The totem creator is considered the leader of the tribe, and invites other hunters into their tribe through their teepee.
Each totem tier requires larger amounts of meat and from more difficult dinosaurs.
Every time a hunter dies, an entire tier from their tribe's totem is lost. So only keep the best hunters.
A new high level backer tier has been added for the final week of the Kickstarter. This is a $400 tier aimed at the totems. These backers will have their portrait carved as one of the official totem tiers that everyone in the game will be using. Additionally, your name will be carved into the back of your portrait totem. The level of the totem head will randomize every time, so you could be level 1, or level 7, etc. An example of a volunteer:
For all of you $15 backers, don't forget that the $55 and $75 tier include 4 copies of the game. This means that if you grab three friends, you can get the game + beta access for under $15, as opposed to just the game.
Thanks, hope you like the video!
German researchers resign from Elsevier journals in push for nationwide open access
Five leading German scientists have resigned from their editorial positions at journals published by Elsevier, the latest step in a battle over open-access and subscription policies between the Dutch publishing giant and a consortium of German libraries, universities, and research institutes.
The researchers want Elsevier to accept a new payment model that would make all papers authored by Germany-based researchers open access. The five are only the first of many ready to step down, warn leaders of the consortium, called Projekt DEAL.
Instead of having individual libraries pay subscriptions for individual journals, Projekt DEAL wants to set up nationwide “publish and read” agreements with publishers. DEAL would pay publishers a lump sum to cover publication costs of papers authored by researchers in Germany. Then all such papers would be open access, and DEAL members would receive electronic access to all the publisher's journals.
Negotiations with Elsevier began in 2016, but stalled late last year. In August a spokesperson for Elsevier told Science Insider that the company fully supports open-access initiatives but that the proposed publishing and read model isn't realistic. In the company's view, paying for German-authored articles to be open access doesn't cover the cost for access to papers from the rest of the world. In reponse to the resignations, a spokesperson said the company respects the decisions of the editors and appreciates "their contributions to their journals and science as a whole... We remain dedicated to achieving a successful outcome to these negotiations."
DEAL representatives say they are determined to continue pushing for the publish-and-read payment model. To increase pressure on the company, almost 200 DEAL member institutions have said they won't renew their subscriptions to Elsevier journals. Elsevier cut off online access for a few weeks in January to institutions whose subscriptions ran out at the end of 2016. But the company restored access, it said, “while good-faith discussions about a nationwide contract carry on.” It isn't clear whether that policy will extend to institutions whose subscriptions run out at the end of this year.
DEAL started negotiations with SpringerNature and Wiley earlier this year, and consortium leaders say those talks have been productive. DEAL has reached a basic agreement with both publishers and is working on the details, according to consortium leaders. In the meantime, subscriptions with both publishers have been extended until the end of 2018.
Kurt Mehlhorn, a computer scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken, Germany, resigned Thursday as editor-in-chief of Computational Geometry Theory and Applications . They didn't take the step lightly, and believes that resigning as editor is one of the few concrete things individual researchers can do to help pressure the publisher. “I was happy to serve as editor. It was a way to be of service to the field.”
Others have followed their lead. A Swiss member of the journal's editorial board has also resigned in response to Mehlhorn's announcement. Mehlhorn says they will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to continue to review papers for Elsevier journals.
Mehlhorn, who led the Max Planck Society's negotiations with Elsevier in 2006, says scientists and publishers have “a symbiotic relationship, and the parties have to treat each other fairly. DEAL is making a fair offer. It's up to Elsevier to make the next move.”
Four other German scientists announced their resignations yesterday as well. Wolfgang Marquardt, a systems engineer and head of the Forschungszentrum Jülich, served on the editorial boards of two Elsevier journals. Cell biologist Marino Zerial of the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden, had been on Cell 's editorial board. Jörg Raisch is a computer engineer at the TU Berlin who was on the editorial board of Automatica , and materials engineer Anton Möslang of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology had served on the board of Nuclear Materials and Energy .
Horst Hippler, president of the German Rectors' Conference in Bonn and lead negotiator for DEAL, expects the number to grow. They say the group plans weekly announcements of scientists who have joined the protest.
*Update, 16 October 2017, 6.00 a.m.: This story has been updated to include a comment from Elsevier and to more accurately explain DEAL's position in the ongoing negotiations.
As Syria takes criticism from almost all quarters, one nation - Russia - stands virtually alone in defending the government of President Bashar al-Assad.
While Arab League ministers discussed future steps on Syria, where 5,400 people have died in anti-government violence, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issued a warning: no sanctions and no foreign troops. Lavrov says that for Russia, the red line is fairly clearly drawn. They say Moscow will not support any sanctions.
At the same press conference, the foreign minister said Russia would use its United Nations Security Council veto to deny a U.N. mandate for the use of foreign troops in Syria
.
At the U.N. and in Moscow, Russian diplomats place violence by Syria's largely civilian opposition on an equal level with violence by Syria's army and police.
Lavrov says Western governments are one-sided because they ignore violence by Syria's opponents.
But some say Russia sides with Syria's government. Last week, Russia's only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, and an eight-ship battle group dropped anchor at Moscow's naval base in Tarsus, Syria. Two days later, a freighter from St. Petersburg reportedly delivered 60 tons of Russian ammunition and weapons to a Syrian port.
Carnegie Moscow Center proliferation analyst Pyotr Topychkanov says the Kremlin is taking a stand in Syria.
“After the change of power in Egypt, in Iraq and in Libya, Russia has lost a number of contracts, including contracts in the arms trade,” they noted.
Yevgeny Satanovsky, president of the Institute of Near Eastern Studies, believes that Arab politicians are using the West to knock out governments sympathetic to Iran.
“We try to support stability and evolution rather than the situation in Libya," they said, "which gives us the view that Western politicians are not more than the instrument in the hands of Qatar and Saudi Arabia. That is not our role in this world.”
Satanovsky, like many Russians today, is deeply skeptical of revolutions.
“The problem is, from the Russian point of view, that the destruction of this regime will mean not democracy and stability. It will mean civil war. Millions of refugees. Hundreds of thousands will be killed," they said. "Deaths of the Syrian Christian community, which is very important for the Russian Orthodox Church.”
For Topychkanov, Russia's phobia of foreign regime change reflects the Kremlin's domestic insecurities.
“After the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring, an intergovernmental commission was launched to assess the regime change influence to the domestic situation in Russia. So this is a fear, a very strong fear, in Moscow, in the political elite,” they said.
As Russia faces more street protests and a presidential election on March 4, few people expect the Kremlin to suddenly show sympathy for the Arab Spring - one year after it began.
Image caption There are a number of businesses in the island that accept Bitcoin as payment
A campaign has been launched to make Jersey a world leader in digital currencies.
Bitcoin payments are already accepted in a handful of places but an industry expert says, if the States allow banks to accept and trade with it, Jersey could become a magnet for new business.
Robbie Andrews, of bit.coin.je, an industry body set up to promote and campaign for the currency, wants to create a "Bitcoin Isle".
Treasury Minister Senator Philip Ozouf said they wanted Jersey to be an early leader in the field.
There have been issues around the digital currency, including a lack of regulation and concerns over potential for money laundering and other illegal activity.
WHAT IS BITCOIN? Image copyright AFP Bitcoin was founded in 2009 although nobody knows by whom, only that they took the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Each Bitcoin, like other forms of crypto-currencies, is simply a long string of computer code protected by a personal key which provides both ownership and security. All Bitcoins in circulation and their transactions histories are recorded in a giant ledger known as the blockchain. This prevents each Bitcoin from being spent twice. No middleman is required to verify the transaction so they are quick, secure and cheap to use. Are crypto-currencies the future of money?
In October 2013 the FBI shut down online marketplace Silk Road. The site traded in drugs and other illegal goods and took payments using "crypto-currencies" such as Bitcoin.
In December 2013, Fiona Le Poidevin, Chief Executive of Guernsey Finance, said the current lack of regulation was an area of concern.
They said the Bitcoin concept had become "increasingly familiar, but it is still in its infancy and this brings with it both challenges and opportunities".
Senator Ozouf said: "[This] is a sector that could hold significant opportunities for Jersey.
"Our infrastructure of world-class financial services and digital expertise gives us the tools to be an early leader in the field. Innovation will be central to Jersey's future prosperity.
"We are keen to support local businesses by helping to create a well-regulated and responsive environment for investment in the sector."
Early in 2014 the Chinese government said Bitcoin was not a currency and banned financial institutions from dealing with Bitcoin exchanges.
BBC chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, said: "It is clear that regulators around the world are unsure about what to make of Bitcoin and are still in the process of making up their mind if and how it and other crypto-currencies should be regulated."
Mr Andrews said Bitcoin was vital to the future of Jersey's economy and would be used globally.
"In the same way email changed how we send files globally, Bitcoin will change how we transact our lives. It is a network you can use for payment that is global and not managed by one industry body."

They said they would like to see more places accept payment in digital currency.
"My plan would be that you get the bus and pay using your phone. You get the paper, you pay with your phone. And at no point do you constantly give people your credit card details."
It is what the digital and finance industry will be using and those two industries are key to Jersey. Giles Day, Tiffin
Tiffin tearoom on St Helier's waterfront already accepts Bitcoin. Owner Giles Day said: "It is fast, reliable and a very secure payment method. It is the way of the future. It is what the digital and finance industry will be using and those two industries are key to Jersey.
"With a credit card, we get charged and it takes a while to get the money. We get Bitcoins into our account straight away, without any charges."
Mr Andrews said the next step would be Bitcoin banking, meaning workers would get paid in Bitcoins.
"That would require new legislation and the States need to act quickly if they want to capitalise on it," they said.
"At the moment there is a big push for a digital industry in Jersey to grow and if you asked any technologist what is the one technology that fits between technology and finance, it would be a crypto-currency like Bitcoin."
Illustration: Nicolle R. Fuller/Sayo-Art In this illustration a panel coated with a multilayered material designed by Stanford engineers helps cool buildings without air conditioning. The material works in two ways. It reflects incoming sunlight [yellow] that would otherwise heat the panel. More importantly, it sends heat from inside the structure directly into space as infrared radiation of a particular wavelength [red]. The result is a cooler [blue] roof.

Conventional cooling is all about moving heat from a place where you don't want it to a place that you care about slightly less. Your refrigerator, for example, cools itself by pumping heat into your house. Your house cools itself by pumping heat into the outdoors. It takes a significant amount of energy to keep this up—15 percent of the energy consumption of most buildings is spent just on air conditioning—meaning that the work put into transferring the heat generates even more heat. And then it's not like the heat just vanishes when it gets outside: in urban areas, all of this waste heat builds up to increase local temperatures as part of the urban heat island effect.
In Nature this week, Stanford researchers describe a passive radiator system that can lower the temperature of anything that it's placed on by up to five degrees Celsius by absorbing heat and sending it directly into outer space, and it even works in direct sunlight.
Radiative cooling is a way of passively moving heat from one place to another through thermal radiation, without the need for any additional energy (like electricity). If you have a hot thing, it will radiate its heat into whatever cooler thing is most convenient. In your house, this is probably the air outside, and in your car, it's also the air outside, by way of the water in your radiator.
Since the general approach here is to use the atmosphere as the final heat sink, radiative cooling doesn't work if you're trying to end up at a temperature lower than the ambient temperature outside, which is why completely passive air conditioning isn't a thing.
The clever thing about the passive radiative cooling system that Stanford came with is that it skips the atmosphere completely, and uses the entire Universe as a place to dump heat. The entire Universe, being mostly empty space, has an average temperature of just under three Kelvin, meaning that it'll happily absorb just about as much heat as you can possibly throw at it, making it a heat sink that's nearly, you know, universal.

To use outer space as a heat sink, you need to have access to outer space, which sounds like it's probably a difficult thing to achieve. But fundamentally, it just means being able to transfer heat straight through Earth's atmosphere. Stanford's cooling system emits thermal radiation in a very specific infrared wavelength that the Earth's atmosphere is completely transparent to, between 8 and 13 micrometers.
So, this is great, but the other part of the problem with radiative cooling is that we really need it to work during the day, when the sun is out and it's hot. But if the sun is warming the radiator more than the radiator can cool itself, the system isn't going to accomplish much. Stanford's radiator also functions as a mirror that can reflect 97 percent of incident sunlight, enabling the radiator to cool itself (or something underneath it) by up to five degrees Celsius even during the heat of the day. In a three-story commercial building with a 1600 square meter roof, using the radiative cooler would save an estimated 118,500 kWh annually, the engineers calculate.
The radiator itself is composed of seven layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide on top of a thin layer of silver. The structure has been tuned to only radiate at the specific infrared wavelengths that can pass through the atmosphere. It's just 1.8 microns thick in total, and the researchers say that it can be fabricated at production scales in existing facilities. Otherwise, the only remaining issue is to figure out how to conduct the heat from inside a building through to the exterior walls, to where the radiator could do its job.
These problems both seem surmountable, and even surmountable in the near future, as opposed to the “five to ten years” void that many technologies like this fall into. If this radiative cooler material can in fact be produced inexpensively and efficiently, it could have a significant impact on energy usage, especially in the developing world where off-grid cooling is often the only option in rural areas.
In a blow to the rights of people with disabilities in California and across the country, a second United States federal judge has ruled that state anti-discrimination laws do not apply to airline websites and kiosks. In a closely watched case against JetBlue Airways, Judge Joseph Spero ruled on August 3, 2011 that regulations issued by the United States Department of Transportation — no matter how weak and ineffective — strip away the rights California residents with visual impairments to access and use JetBlue's website and airport kiosks.
[Note: After this article was originally posted, the JetBlue court decision was appealed. Read the post about the appeal.]
The Judge threw the case out of court on the airline's motion to dismiss. In doing so, they followed in the footsteps of another federal District Court Judge in California who ruled in April that because of the federal Department of Transportation's actions, United Airlines was free to have airline check-in kiosks that cannot be used by people with disabilities.
The rulings in the JetBlue and United cases are based solely on very specific regulations and laws governing airlines, and will not affect claims for website or kiosk accessibility in any other public or private sector settings. The rulings do, however, effectively slam the door on the rights of people with disabilities to full inclusion in services or programs offered by airlines. The United States Department of Transportation has failed the country's citizens with visual impairments, and its failure has now been given the stamp of approval by two federal district courts.
Federal Department of Transportation Shirks Responsibility, Claims Control, and Deprives Blind Citizens of Their Rights
The federal law of preemption when it comes to airline accessibility is arcane and complex, but boils down to a simple question: Has the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) issued regulations that are “pervasive”? If no, people with disabilities are free to pursue rights under state law. If yes, then people with disabilities are not protected by state law and only have whatever rights the DOT has put in the regulations.
In the JetBlue and United cases, the judges ruled that DOT regulations about websites and kiosks were “pervasive” even though they are weak and don't require accessible websites or kiosks! In the United case, the federal DOT actually wrote to the court agreeing with United's position that the case should be dismissed.
DOT Airline Kiosk Regulations Do Not Require Accessible Kiosks
The Courts in both the JetBlue and United cases found that the U.S. Department of Transportation had issued pervasive regulations on airline kiosk accessibility, yet those regulations do not require access! Instead, the regulations simply tell airlines that if their kiosks are not accessible, they must provide assistance to customers with disabilities. No details of what that assistance consists of is included in the so-called pervasive regulations.
The Courts' ruling on airline kiosks, and the DOT's failure to act, is particularly disappointing because accessible airline kiosks are available for purchase. And kiosks that are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities – from Talking ATMs to self-service postal kiosks deployed in post offices around the country – have been installed for many years. Advocacy on the ground has resulted in accessible kiosks in a variety of settings, and the Department of Transportation regulations have simply not kept pace with current technology.
DOT Airline Website Regulations Do Not Require Accessible Websites
As with airline kiosks, the federal Department of Transportation has thus far refused to require accessible websites, bowing to industry pressure to delay effective regulations. According to the Judge's ruling in JetBlue, in 2008, the DOT “considered a proposal that would require air carriers to make their websites accessible to the visually impaired, but comments from air carriers and air carrier organizations that such a rule would be too difficult and expensive led the DOT to “defer[] final action” on the proposal and seek additional comments on the matter.”
Instead of requiring websites that people with disabilities can use, the DOT issued a weak regulation “in the interim” requiring that web-only fares be offered on the telephone to people with disabilities who could not access the website. We are now halfway through 2011 and there are still no regulations requiring airline websites to be accessible to people with disabilities, although supposedly the DOT is going to issue something soon. Still, the Judge in the JetBlue case found that DOT's actions, however limited and ineffective, were enough to “preempt” the rights of people with disabilities under state civil rights laws claims.
The DOT has refused to protect the country's blind citizens from airline discrimination, and now those citizens are unable to seek that protection under state laws.

Have you ever wondered what life is really like for a pug?
I know I have. They get to hang about and pretty much do whatever they want. After all, how could you ever say no to the sweet, wrinkly, squishy face of a pug? It seems like they've got it made.
In a way, pugs are kind of like the celebrities of the dog world. People love to follow them on Instagram and post pictures of them on their own social media profiles. There's definitely a kind of charm to them that makes them truly stand out. One woman even adopted 30 pugs. Yes, 30.
These 11 fun pictures show what a nice life a pug gets to lead. With it spelled out for me like this, I'm pretty convinced that it would, in fact, be pretty awesome to be a pug.

The Alpental Golf Course near Garmisch, is slated to be returned to Germany.
This article has been corrected.
A military golf course, hotel and skeet range are among the 21 facilities that will be given up across Europe in connection with a Pentagon review aimed at shedding excess infrastructure on the Continent, the Pentagon announced Friday. Every major installation in Europe, however, survived the cuts.
The Defense Department emphasized that none of the closures will affect the size of the force in Europe, which now stands at just under 70,000 troops.
The cuts to unneeded facilities will allow U.S. European command to focus resources on higher-priority missions, Rear Adm. John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary said Friday.
“It doesn't at all change our military capability on the continent or degrade in any way our readiness to meet our security commitments there in Europe,” they told reporters at the Pentagon.
For more than a year, the Defense Department has been conducting what has been characterized as a “BRAC-like” review of infrastructure in Europe. The review, dubbed the European Infrastructure Consolidation, resulted in widespread speculation among personnel at many bases in Europe that their installation could be on the chopping block.
Instead of cutting major installations, a series of non-operational sites, including outdated and excess family housing facilities, recreation sites and storage depots, were selected for closure.
In all, DOD said the moves will save $60 million annually. Facilities were affected across a wide swath of the EUCOM area of operation, stretching from Germany and Spain to Italy, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Greece.
The department continues looking for unneeded infrastructure to shutter, Kirby said.
“It's an ongoing process and it will continue,” they said. “This is sort of the first tranche of what I suspect will be other changes to come.”
The decision comes as security challenges in Europe have returned to the forefront.
Since the end of the Cold War, during which as many as 400,000 U.S. personnel were stationed on the Continent, the military has shuttered hundreds of facilities both big and small. In the year ahead, Army garrisons in Schweinfurt and Bamberg, Germany, also will close as part of earlier Army transformation decisions.
In recent years, some lawmakers have singled out Europe as a place to achieve more savings, describing the military presence there as a bloated Cold War relic amid calls for a major downsizing on the Continent.
Since Russia's intervention in Ukraine, the EUCOM mission appears to have taken on new significance as the West wrestles with how to manage a resurgent Russia.
Kirby said EUCOM's forward presence serves as a tangible commitment to allies in Europe, underpinning the U.S.'s commitment to the collective defense of its European partners.
“U.S. dedication to our NATO security responsibilities is beyond doubt; ongoing infrastructure adjustments simply ensure that we are best-positioned to fulfill those responsibilities given changing circumstances,” the Pentagon stated in a news release.
DOD said the following sites are scheduled to be returned to their respective host nation:

Dear Valued Customer,
We know your privacy is important, so we've made it a priority to talk to you about it. We're revising our Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand, and we want to point out two new programs that could help us and other businesses serve you better.
The first program will make reports available to businesses. These reports will contain anonymous information about groups of customers, such as how they collectively use our products and services. The second program will use local geography as a factor in delivering online and mobile ads to the people who might find them most useful.
As always, we follow important principles to keep your trust: We are committed to protecting your privacy.
We provide you with privacy choices.
We will not sell information that identifies you to anyone, for any purpose. Period.
We are committed to listening and keeping you informed about how we protect your privacy. The two new programs are described in this notice, including your privacy choices for each. You can also read the new and old versions of our privacy policy at
To provide feedback on the new policy, please write us in the next 30 days at
Sincerely,
Robert W. Quinn Jr.
AT&T
Senior Vice President - Federal Regulatory & Chief Privacy Officer
P.S.: Please note that if you have multiple accounts, we thank you, and we want to let you know you may receive more than one copy of this notice.
How do we use information?
Information is collected whenever you use our products and services. From this information, we can do things like enhance the network, address problems and manage your services.
Here are details about two new programs, including privacy choices that you can make now and change any time you like.
Program One: "External Marketing & Analytics Reports"
We will make reports available to businesses to help them serve their customers better. These reports will contain anonymous information about our customers, such as how they use our products and services. The identity of individual customers is removed, and the information is used in a group, or aggregate, format.
For example, we might provide reports to retailers about the number of wireless devices in or near their store locations by time of day and day of week, together with the device users' collective information like ages and gender. This might allow a retailer in your neighborhood to learn more about local consumers as a group, but not about anyone individually, to improve its service.
You can choose to have your anonymous information excluded from these reports - things like wireless location information, U-verse® information, and website browsing or mobile application usage. Please visit
Program Two: Relevant Advertising including "Wireless Location Characteristics"
Relevant advertising from AT&T uses information from a variety of sources to help deliver online and mobile ads that you might find useful. We're currently creating a new "wireless location characteristic" that will help us use local geography as a factor in delivering ads. This doesn't mean you'll get more ads. It means that the ads that you do get from AT&T may be more suited to your interests.
Location characteristics are types of locations - like "movie theaters." People who live in a particular geographic area might appear to be very interested in movies, thanks to collective information that shows wireless devices from that area are often located in the vicinity of movie theaters. We might create a "movies" characteristic for that area, and deliver movie ads to the people who live there.
Personal information is not shared with advertisers, but if you don't want to receive this type of ad from us, you have that choice. You will still receive the same number of ads. They just might not be as relevant to you. Simply go to © 2013 AT&T Intellectual Property. All rights reserved.

In response to Freedom of Information Law request filed by MuckRock, New York City released a document listing every civil-rights lawsuit brought against the NYPD since 2009, as well as how much money it cost to settle each one. As you can imagine, there's a lot of information to sift through (take a look for yourself here), but one piece of information really sticks out: Over the past five years, the city has spent a total of $428 million on police-related settlements.
As Gothamist pointed out, these settlements aren't all the result of basic misconduct by cops. For example, the largest payout, $11.5 million, went to Google engineer Sasha Blair-Goldensohn, who was nearly killed in 2009 when a tree branch fell on them in Central Park. Another big one — $2.75 million — went to the family of Ronald Spear, who died after being beaten by Rikers Island guards, who work for the Department of Correction, not the NYPD. Still, there are more than 10,000 cases (average settlement: $33,875) listed on the document provided to MuckRock, and it seems likely that most are about what you'd expect.
For those of you who have been under a rock for the past near-48 hours, we are delighted to announce that our #ArtemisFowlMovie campaign and our petition absolutely stormed the web, and is over halfway to reaching our target of 10,000 signatures!
Within a few hours of the petition going live, it had reached the Front Page of Reddit, bringing tens-of-thousands of users to AFC, nearly collapsing our web server entirely. We went viral across Facebook & Twitter, with thousands of Likes, Shares, Tweets & Retweets. It was utter magic, and so incredibly heart-warming to see that the Artemis Fowl Fandom is very much alive and kicking across the world. We even made it onto Eoin Colfer's personal Facebook & Twitter profiles!
Am genuinely touched by fans support to get an #ArtemisFowlFilm made. Petition currently happening @AFConfidential http://t.co/rIKM1leZZL — Eoin Colfer (@eoincolfer) March 3, 2015
However, our work is not done yet.
The aim of this campaign is to make our voices head. To tell Disney that we have been waiting for nearly 15 YEARS for a movie.
‘So, what's next?' I hear you ask…
Well, the first thing we need to do is show the world that the fandom is very much still alive. Once we hit 10,000 signatures (and we will be pushing hard over the coming days to ensure we reach this goal) we will organise the next step in our campaign for a movie. So, until then, check out some links below on what you can do to help further the cause.
BANGOR – Gov. Paul LePage told a group of conservatives Wednesday that if the Legislature doesn't pass their controversial tax overhaul this year they will mount an election campaign next year against the lawmakers who opposed it.
“I fully expect the Legislature is going to say no this year,” they added. “But next year is an election year and I am going to spend the rest of my time as governor fighting the battle of eliminating the income tax and reducing energy costs, I promise you.”
The governor delivered their remarks to about 70 paid attendees of a luncheon sponsored by the Maine Heritage Policy Center, a conservative advocacy group, at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor. The governor touched on a number of policy areas, including their budget plan, welfare programs and energy costs, during the 40-minute speech. They also made a cryptic reference to their administration's pitched battle with Portland over General Assistance spending, hinting that they had another plan for the state's largest city, but they declined to describe it because reporters were present.
The governor devoted most of their speech to promoting their tax plan, a sweeping overhaul embedded in their two-year budget proposal.
LePage has admitted that their plan faces political headwinds. However, their vow to work against state lawmakers who vote against it was their most forceful move yet in support of the overhaul.
“If it doesn't pass this year and you invite me back next year, I'll come back with a 20-(point) font … with the name of every legislator and senator who voted against the elimination of the income tax,” they said. “I will spend the rest of my days as governor criticizing and going after those people who don't care about our elderly, our disabled, people with mental illness, babies being born addicted to drugs.”
LEGISLATIVE LEADERS HAVE LITTLE REACTION
The reaction from legislative leaders was muted, despite the governor's threat of electoral consequences.
House Speaker Mark Eves, D-North Berwick, said Democrats have concerns about the budget, but have been at the “table negotiating a better deal for middle-income Mainers and small businesses.”
They added, “We have serious concerns about the increase in property taxes, the lack of workforce investment when our economy is struggling, and the fact that the governor's budget is not paid for.”
Republican leadership, including Senate President Mike Thibodeau of Winterport, Senate Majority Leader Garrett Mason of Lisbon Falls, and House Minority Leader Kenneth Fredette of Newport, all declined to comment.
Driving the tax proposal is an income tax cut that would reduce the top rate from 7.95 percent to 5.75 percent and save taxpayers a projected $938 million over the next four years.
LePage has proposed paying for the lost revenue with other changes, including an increase in the sales tax rate to 6.5 percent. The current rate is 5.5 percent, but it was supposed to fall to 5 percent at the end of the fiscal year June 30.
SOME RESISTANCE TO GOVERNOR'S PLAN
The sales tax increase has left the governor vulnerable to conservative critics. Some current Republican lawmakers actively campaigned to help defeat a similar tax plan passed in 2009, and party leaders have not made a full public endorsement of the governor's proposal.
The Maine Heritage Policy Center crowd gave LePage a lukewarm reception overall, with some applause and some in the audience asking questions. The response from the governor's traditional allies outside of the State House has also been subdued.
During a brief question-and-answer session at Wednesday's event, Jinger Duryea, a member of the policy center's board of directors, told the governor that small businesses near the New Hampshire border could be hurt by the sales tax increase. New Hampshire does not have a sales tax.
“The last thing we want to see is a sales tax increase,” they said.
The governor acknowledged that the increase would not be ideal, but said it was the only way to help pay for the reduction in the income tax, the cornerstone of their tax plan and their budget.
“I do agree that it's sort of setting up the good, the bad and the ugly,” they said, adding that the state's population and demographics could not absorb a complete income tax elimination “without growing the sales tax a little bit.”
LePage also mentioned their plan to introduce an amendment to the state constitution that would require the drawdown of the income tax over time. They didn't expect that would pass until next year, an election year. And again, they vowed to campaign against any lawmaker who opposed it. The governor argued that the budget and tax plan was the first “attempt to really pay attention to Maine people” and that it will result in the “highest, fastest wage increase that all Mainers are going to receive.”
ON PORTLAND: NO HINT ON WHAT ‘I TRIED TO DO'
The governor covered a variety of topics toward the end of their speech, including Maine's prospects for importing nuclear energy, socialized medicine and how the 50 states are the “laboratories of democracy” that will save the country from the federal deficit. They referenced the Canadian health care system, adding that “this is where we're heading. It's not a premonition. It's not something I made up.”
Referring to Maine's energy costs and their impact on the economy, they summoned up the image of China, where rural residents are flocking to cities to find work but face overcrowding and high living costs.
“If we don't do something, we aren't going to be able to have our kids live here and survive here. They're going to be forced into – like all the Chinese people are – into the urban areas,” LePage said.
They paused before shifting to the topic of Portland, the city with which their administration has been engaged in a fierce debate over welfare spending and aid to immigrants.
“Just think about this: Everybody in Maine living in Portland,” LePage said. “I see some funny looks!”
They referenced Portland again, but stopped short.
“The press is here so I won't tell you what I tried to do,” they said.
The policy center luncheon was the governor's first of two stops in Bangor on Wednesday. They also held a town hall meeting on their budget at Husson University's Gracie Theatre in the evening.

Cincinnati Vice Mayor David Mann wants to know why an audit of the Metropolitan Sewer District didn't include an accusation that a city official threatened a law firm.
Mann asked their fellow council members on Thursday to join them in seeking more information about the threat accusation and how it may be related to a $55,000 MSD settlement with consultant and former City Councilman Sam Malone.
The threat accusation appeared in a draft version of the city's recent MSD audit, but it was removed from the final version.
"I felt a little blind-sided. I wasn't aware there was an earlier draft," Mann said Thursday. "The more I thought about it, the more I thought it doesn't seem very transparent to me."
Mann's questions are connected to a $55,000 settlement the city paid to Malone in 2015 for work they claimed to have done while working as a sub-contractor for the Columbus law firm Bricker & Eckler. One of the firm's attorneys, Mark Evans, told city auditors that the city pressured them to pay Malone and also threatened to revoke the firm's contract with MSD if they didn't sign off on the payment.
According to the draft version of the audit, Evans said "he received a communication that the city would no longer engage their firm if the sub-contractor was not paid post haste." The auditors didn't say who made the threat, but Malone got their $55,000 check.
Mann said they also want more information on why the city, which runs MSD, paid the settlement at all and about the relationship between MSD and Bricker & Eckler. The Enquirer reported in February that the firm's arrangement with Malone was unusual and that the city's settlement with them was paid even though it's unclear what work Malone did to earn the payment or if their contract required it.
For more than two years prior to the settlement, Malone was paid based on vague monthly invoices they submitted to the law firm, which then passed them on to former MSD Director Tony Parrott for approval. Under terms of the law firm's contract with MSD, it did not supervise Malone, approve their work or see their work. The firm's contract also required the city to pay Bricker & Eckler for Malone's work before the firm would pass money on to Malone.
The arrangement is unusual because sub-contractors typically are hired by contractors to perform specific tasks. In this case, the firm has said MSD asked it to take on Malone as a sub-contractor.

The city paying Malone last year, but Malone continued to submit invoices for at least four months. The Enquirer found those invoices totaled $55,000 and that the city completed a settlement with them in June, but only after extending an old contract with Bricker & Eckler by the necessary $55,000 and then cutting a check for Malone and closing out the deal on the same day.
Mann said he's concerned that an attorney with the firm would accuse a city official of making a threat associated with that settlement and they want more specifics about what auditors and city officials may know about it. City Manager Harry Black said the threat was deemed unsubstantiated because the person accused of making the threat -- and another person accused of having knowledge of it -- both denied the allegation.
Mann said that's not good enough. "It was taken out because it was denied, but that doesn't mean the threat did not happen," Mann said. "It's troubling."
Mann's request will be discussed at city council's rules and audit committee next Tuesday.

The Syrian Arab Army's 104th Airborne Brigade of the Republican Guard (Harss Al-Jamhouri) has reportedly captured sector 1 and 2 of the protective barriers at the Deir Ezzor Military Airport after fierce clashes with the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS) over the last 72 hours.
ISIS militants have attempted to infiltrate into the Deir Ezzor Military Airport on at least 4 occasions over the course of 3 days, resulting in their brief infiltration towards the 1st and 2nd sector of the base.
In Al-Mari'iyah, Al-Jafra, and Haweeja Al-Sakr (Sakr Island), the Syrian Arab Air (SAAF) Force launched 8 airstrikes on ISIS positions in these areas, destroying a number of militant sites in the process.
According to a military source in Deir Ezzor, the 104th Brigade captured a large part of the Al-Jubeileh and Al-Sina'a Quarters inside the provincial capital; this has forestalled ISIS' progress on the western bank of the Euphrates River.
Firefights are still ongoing in Al-Jubeileh and Al-Sina'a; however, the military source further added that the situation is under control and that the 104th Brigade has repelled the ISIS counter-attack at the local bank in Al-Jubeileh.
At Al-Jafra, the 104th Brigade has jumped on the offensive after capturing the farm adjacent to them village of Al-Mari-iyah – the SAA also destroyed an ISIS T-55 tank during their successful attack.
The new emir of ISIS in Deir Ezzor has been killed – they were named the emir 48 hours before they were reportedly killed. The militant leader was identified as Hammam Al-Tayaani of Deir Ezzor.

UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visited Gambia on Wednesday and said that the country's bid to re-join the Commonwealth group of mostly ex-British colonies would happen in the “coming months”. However, applying for membership of the club of 52 countries involves various steps and the Gambian government has not yet kicked off the process, according to a spokesperson for the Commonwealth Secretariat.
“It's difficult to put an exact timeframe on the process,” Neil Ford, Director of Communications, told RFI by telephone from London. “The Commonwealth family wants to work hard to bring Gambia back,” they added.
Q&A: Neil Ford
Gambia quit the Commonwealth in 2013 when the government of former president Yahya Jammeh described it as a “neo-colonial institution”. Jammeh had frequently clashed with the country's former colonial master and accused the UK of backing Gambia's political opposition.
President Adama Barrow has since then signalled their intention to re-join the Commonwealth following the departure of Jammeh. But there are a number of steps that the new government will have to go through.
“First of all, The Gambia has to write a letter requesting to be re-admitted, and so far that hasn't happened,” said Commonwealth spokesperson Ford, pointing out that the government had informally said it would like to re-join.
Next, an informal assessment is undertaken by the Commonwealth's secretary general to look at the country's commitment to the bloc's ideals of democracy and good governance as well as determining the nature of the country's relationship with the group, according to Ford.
The Commonwealth chief would then consult with all member states to make sure they agreed with Gambia's membership. Finally, the bloc would extend an invitation to the Gambia and the country would be “formally taken on board”, said Ford.
It is unlikely that other member states would raise objections to Gambia's re-admittance to the organisation, according to the spokesperson. “The nature of their [the secretary general] conversations will be, ‘is there a consensus that this country should be admitted in,'” they said.
Gambia will be able to take advantage of a number of benefits once it is re-admitted to the Commonwealth, said Ford, including "clear and practical advice" on climate finance, building trade capacity, working on debt management and natural resources development.
"We have a particular track record in helping small states," said the Commonwealth spokesperson, referring to programmes on election monitoring, strengthening judiciaries and working with human rights institutions.
“It's a little bit different with The Gambia because The Gambia is re-joining, not joining for the first time,” said Ford. “We all want to have it happen as quickly as possible.”
This story appears in the December issue of VICE magazine.
Humans are good at destroying big, important things like wonders of nature and protective layers in the atmosphere. We've already knocked out half of the Great Barrier Reef through activities like dumping dredge waste, but it appears Australians have a new weapon to eradicate the remaining reef.
Because of half a century spent obliterating our ozone protection, Australia has some of the highest levels of UV rays and, thus, some of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. As a result, Aussies are raised in the religion of SPF and anoint themselves in sunscreen with UV-filtering oxybenzone daily. At the beach, they practically bathe in it.
Too bad that while oxybenzone protects the skin, it also poisons coral, according to recent studies.
Selina Ward, a coral-reef expert at the University of Queensland, told VICE that she's been suspicious of sunscreen for years and noted that some Mexican marine parks have already banned tourists from applying it before swimming near delicate reefs.
When exposed to oxybenzone, coral larvae become deformed and unable to spread through ocean currents. The chemical also exacerbates bleaching, causing coral to expel its primary source of nutrition: the algae that live inside it. Bleaching is a primary killer of reefs worldwide, and in 2002 it had affected more than 60 percent of the Great Barrier Reef.
Considering Australians' all-pervasive culture of loving the outdoors, swimming, and wearing sunscreen, Ward warns that the country's reefs are particularly threatened by exposure to the chemical, which has been found in high concentrations in water around areas of the reef most popular with tourists. Sure, sunscreen is diluted in open water as we snorkel around, but it takes surprisingly little to cause significant damage.
"The reactions are devastating at incredibly low concentrations," Ward explained. "Imagine a snorkel site, with forty people getting off a boat, lathered in sunscreen." For reference, as one of the most popular travel destinations on the planet, the Great Barrier Reef attracts 2.19 million UV-fearing, sunscreen-covered tourists annually.
So the chain of environmental devastation continues: We take out the ozone layer, ozone layer takes out our epidermis, our epidermis is caked in sunscreen, and sunscreen takes out one of the wonders of the natural world. We look forward to next month's announcement that barbecues are the reason all those koalas have chlamydia.
If you think that the recent attack by a Black terrorist in London says anything about the harm done by mass immigration, then think again. A great liberal intellectual called Matthew D'Ancona has crushed such racist nonsense with these lines in the world's greatest newspaper:
As we now know, the attacker, Khalid Masood, was British, born in Kent and brought up as Adrian Russell Elms. Their story is one of radicalisation, the question being when and how they embraced extremist Islamist ideology: the path that led them to an act of murderous violence has nothing to do with immigration. (The Brexiteers' immigration promises are unravelling fast, The Guardian, 27th March 2017)
See? The terrorist was born here. They were 100% British. Immigration had nothing to do with their terrorism. Somehow the concept of second-generation immigrants is far too complex for these intellectuals, so that the ill effects of policies in place for 50+ years can only be discussed within the context of recent immigrants not born in the UK.
Voila! Crime, terrorism and academic failure by second-generation immigrants have nothing to do with immigration. Believing their own propaganda, these intellectuals imply that second-generation immigrants have been entirely shaped by mainstream British culture, so that the cultures immigrants bring with them to the UK are completely irrelevant. It's the same with personal traits like IQ: Mental ability has nothing to do with the ethnic/racial/religious heritage of immigrants after the first generation. Whatever their performance, it is due to have been born in the UK, with low performance likely due to White racism. It's like saying that Masood would have been born in the UK even if their parents had stayed overseas.
We saw the same logic applied when Omar Mateen, son of Afghan immigrants, committed mass murder in a gay nightclub in Florida. Gary Younge, another great Guardian intellectual, said this: “Whatever else this is, it's not about immigration. Omar Mateen, the suspected killer, was born in America. Whatever compelled them to commit such a terrible act cannot be laid at the border of a foreign nation. Their hatred was home-grown.”
I responded to Younge's reasoning like this:
Ignorant haters like Donald Trump might claim that Mateen was only an American citizen because their parents emigrated from Afghanistan. Gary Younge knows better: Omar Mateen would have been born in the US even if their parents had stayed in Afghanistan. Their embryo would have materialized from the American air and grown to term thousands of miles from their mother's womb, nourished by a mysterious process possibly involving quantum nonlocality or Dawkins's demon. (Sunshine Hate, TOO, 16th June 2016)
Now we discover that the same mysterious process could have worked in the UK. Khalid Masood would have been born in Britain even if their Black father had never been allowed to immigrate here, impregnate their White mother out of wedlock, and then, it appears, abandon them in typical Black fashion. And not only that: after Masood's miraculous birth, Islam would have become powerful here and attracted violent criminals even if Muslims had not entered the country in such large numbers. Masood was destined from all eternity to be born in Britain, become a Muslim and commit those murders. No ban on immigration could have stopped him. Nor could any ban have stopped these other vibrant terrorists: “Even if you look at the last time London suffered a major attack, three of the four 7/7 bombers were born in Britain.”
The British-born London bombers had nothing to do with immigration, just like the British-born Khalid Masood and the American-born Omar Mateen. Or so liberals like Younge and D'Ancona want us to believe. When it comes to a choice between reality and self-serving delusion, liberals don't hesitate for a second. It's delusion every time. After all, it's the little people who usually pay the price for the West's insane and evil immigration policies. Here is an example, long-forgotten by liberals, from 2005:
Gang forced kidnap girl, 16, to take crack before killing her, court told A 16-year-old girl was kidnapped, raped and forced to take heroin and crack cocaine before being murdered by a gang of six men. Reading crown court heard how Mary-Ann Leneghan was stabbed to death in a park in May 2005 after they and their 18-year-old friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were abducted. The friend survived, despite being shot in the head. On the opening day of the trial, Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said that six men shared joint responsibility in the girls' ordeal. Mary-Ann and their friend had been sitting in a car when they were abducted. They were bundled into a car boot and driven to a guesthouse, where the men booked a room. According to accounts given by the friend, the men [laid] towels on the floor as soon as they entered to avoid leaving traces of blood. The women were subjected to “a concentrated sequence of controlled acts of violence and degradation” over a long period. They were made to strip, were hit with a pole, cut with knives, and raped. A gun was put into the 18-year-old's mouth while the men laughed. They crowded round them while they were on all fours and told them they were going to cut off part of their genitals and feed it to them (Gang forced kidnap girl, 16, to take crack before killing her, The Guardian, 14th January 2006)
The gang consisted of five Blacks and an Albanian Muslim “asylum-seeker.” Like Khalid Masood, the leader of the gang, Adrian Thomas, was the abandoned son of a Black father. I can remember hearing the father interviewed on BBC Radio about the case and about how much responsibility they bore for their son's criminality. They pretended to be contrite about being a “fringe father.” But their mask of contrition slipped when the female reporter asked them about their illegitimate children and why they hadn't used contraception. “Listen, darling,” they said with sudden menace. “Contraception doesn't always work.”
Black logic, you see. Because contraception doesn't always work, it doesn't matter if you don't use it. And if you have illegitimate children, you won't have to involve yourself in their upbringing or pay to bring them up. The White taxpayer will take care of everything. This largesse doesn't just encourage feckless and irresponsible Blacks and Gypsies to have more children: it encourages feckless and irresponsible Whites too, and it subsidizes births in the rapidly expanding Muslim population.
All these groups have strong tendencies towards high criminality, low trust, and low educational achievement, but liberals like Younge and D'Ancona are confident that the laws of evolution don't apply to human beings. It's another miracle: feckless low-IQ criminals can outbreed responsible and law-abiding British Whites, but this will have no effect on society. British newspapers are reporting that Khalid Masood was academically gifted in their schooldays as Adrian Elms, but they excelled at crime and violence as an adult, not at intellectual achievement. They were bad for Britain long before their murderous attack in London.
But let's look on the bright side. Securicrats are using their attack to argue for even more surveillance of the entire British population:
The UK government is right to back electronic surveillance as it is our first line of defence The challenge is to strike a balance between protecting us from evil, and enfolding us in a security blanket so heavy that it would stifle the very liberties we are striving to preserve. So far in this century, I would suggest that governments have got this pretty right. They have provided lavish new funding for MI5, MI6 and, above all, GCHQ [the British equivalent of the NSA]. They have backed electronic surveillance, which some foolish libertarians denounce as the machinations of a police state, but which represents our first line of defence in detecting terrorists. I have visited GCHQ's headquarters in Cheltenham and roamed its gigantic underground level, where hundreds of computers churn 24/7, monitoring data and keywords from countless millions of phone conversations and internet communications. Libertarians such as The Guardian newspaper find such scrutiny intolerable, but I — and probably you, too — are more than happy to have my own phone conversations tapped as the price of empowering our spooks to pinpoint such a man as who carried out yesterday's savage killings. (The UK government is right to back electronic surveillance as it is our first line of defence, writes Max Hastings, The Daily Mail, 23rd March 2017)
Max Hastings, who may be part-Jewish, is talking nonsense when they call the Guardian “libertarians.” The Guardian ruthlessly censors comments at its website and fully supports harsh laws against thought-crime on race and immigration. The newspaper is right to question the surveillance state, but it doesn't admit the full truth. The same liars and traitors who opened Britain's borders to the Third World are also behind the surveillance state. Like cholera, mass immigration is a gift that goes on giving, generation after generation.
On this episode of Breaking the Set, Abby Martin goes over the first day of the DC whistleblower summit and comments on the news that President Obama's website Change.org was scrubbed from the internet, including their pledge to protect whistleblowers. Abby then talks to former Northrop Grumman whistleblower James Holzrichter about their experience in blowing the whistle against fraud within the defense industry, as well as the climate for whistleblowers today. Abby then goes over the case of Katie Barnett, an Ohio resident who had their home mistaken for one that was foreclosed on. Bank thugs who robbed and ransacked Barnett's home are refusing to pay for the damages. Sadly, their case is far from uncommon. BTS wraps up the show with an interview with Alexis Bayden Mayer about a recent revelation from a German newspaper that Monsanto is working in concert with the US government to spy on anti-GMO activists and researchers. They talk about GMO myths, labeling laws, and the recent Monsanto buy-out of Beeologics.

Well, I guess the atheist bus ad strategy is catching on. Though someone was definitely not thinking strategically in this case.
Not only are there now bus ads for Islam, they're appearing on buses in San Francisco…
Two immediate thoughts:
First of all, I better not hear of any atheist protesting those signs being allowed on the buses. If we want our ads on buses, we need to support free speech for them, too.
Secondly, that sign is *so* ineffective. Atheists are clearly much better at designing catchy, welcoming, pleasant bus advertising 🙂 Good for us.
What Does Islam Say About Homosexuality? … Islam teaches that homosexual acts are sinful and punishable by God. This teaching comes not from human beings, but from the Creator of all humans. God tells us in Their own words how They punished the people of Lot for their homosexual behaviour.
Not only that, but if you go to the website in question , the gay people in San Francisco will be happily enlightened, I'm sure:
Yep. I'm convinced. I'm sure the gay people are, too. Anyone else ready to convert?
…
What other religious advertising will we see in the near future?
Where would be a good place (or not-so-good place) for that religion to advertise?
(via Zomblog)
As the father of a newborn baby boy, I've spent countless hours fretting over whether or not to circumcise my son, David. I used to consider the procedure relatively standard, but recently, I had a change of heart. I took a step back and began to consider the negative side of circumcision, which led me to a definitive conclusion: I refuse to circumcise my son because their foreskin keeps growing back.
Refusing to circumcise my son is no easy decision, but I'm confident it's the right one. At first, I was adamant that I wanted David circumcised. But after considering various articles about how antiquated circumcision is and seeing David's foreskin persistently grow back after each surgery, I started to reconsider my stance. After hours of research and nine circumcisions later, I decided that enough was enough.
It's time we as a society agree that circumcision isn't always the right choice, especially when your son's foreskin is rewriting medical textbooks everywhere.
Advertisement
Other parents may have their own reasons for or against circumcision, but I've made my choice, and I'm sticking to it. I fear that circumcision could impact my son's quality of life. Just think: The sheer number of hospital visits necessary to keep up with their unconquerable foreskin would make David's childhood anything but normal. Plus, with its current consistency of an all-terrain tire, their foreskin keeps getting harder and harder to cut off.
When I was born, my parents had me circumcised. I don't hold any ill will towards them, nor do I wish it hadn't happened. But I also lack the medical marvel of a penis that my son has. If my parents had experienced what I'm going through, they surely would've put an end to it. It's time we as a society agree that circumcision isn't always the right choice, especially when your son's foreskin is rewriting medical textbooks everywhere.
Knowing what I know now, it's hard to fathom that I was once pro-circumcision. The foreskin is a natural and apparently sometimes indestructible thing, and because of that, we parents need to leave it alone. If my son wants to take another crack at it when they grow up, that's their decision, and they have every right to make it. My only words of advice to them would be, “Good luck. And maybe try using a pair of garden shears.”

(CBS) Contrary to rumors that have been flying for nearly a week, a league source told 670 The Score Thursday that the White Sox reached out to Major League Baseball and were assured that catcher A.J. Pierzynski will not be suspended for using a banned substance.
The source said rumors that Pierzynski tested positive for using a banned substance were not true.
Rumors reached a peak Wednesday when they were posted on message boards and they concerned the White Sox enough to inquire with the league office.
The word back from Major League Baseball was that there is nothing to the rumors, according to the league source.
“I'm not interested in talking about rumors,” White Sox pitching coach Don Cooper said Thursday on The Mully And Hanley Show on 670 The Score. “If you're foolish enough to use them, then you deserve to get caught.”
Pierzynski, 35, is batting .281 with 71 RBI and a career-high 24 home runs this season.

On January 4, President Igor Dodon of Moldova met with Vadim Krasnoselskiy, the head of the unrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria). The meeting took place in Bendery, on the right bank of Dniester river, on the territory of the Transnistria. It was initiated by the president of Moldova.
Igor Dodon was elected Moldovan president on November 13 on a platform advocating improved relations with Russia.
During the meeting, both sides established a good contact and expressed openness and willingness to compromise. Concrete decisions have been taken to improve relations between Moldova and Transnistria. “Citizens on both sides of the Dniester River (which runs through the territory of Moldova and the right (eastern) border of Transnistria) should see the concrete results during 2017,” stated President of Moldova Igor Dodon .
The president of Transnistria Vadim Krasnoselskiy stressed the importance of compromise with Moldova for people living on both sides. “We must create the conditions so that people are not held hostage to politics, so that decisions taken by politicians are for the benefit of the people. We must respect the people of Moldova and Transnistria and find a compromise in any case”, stated Vadim Krasnoselskiy.
During the meeting, the first in eight years, the presidents of Moldova and Trasnistria discussed a whole range of practical issues that have accumulated in recent years, including problems in education, registration of vehicles, communication, movement of citizens, rail transport, recognition of diplomas and car plates.
At the same time, political issues were not discussed. Recognition of the independence of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) by Chisinau remains the main bone of contention between the two republics. Chisinau designates PMR as the Transnistria autonomous territorial unit with special legal status. PMR is not recognized by any country, member of the UN, while the UN itself considers PMR to be part of Moldova.
PMR emerged as a reaction of the mostly Slavic population of this territory to the rise of pro-Romanian nationalism among ethnic Moldovans in the late 1980s, the period of Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost in Russia. The most prominent movement formed at that time, the Popular Front of Moldova, formulated three main demands: that Moldovan be declared the only state language, that the Moldovan language switch to use of the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillic one, and that Moldovan ethnic identity be recognized as identical to Romanian one. The radical factions of the Popular Front called for minority populations, particularly the Slavs (mainly Russians and Ukrainians) and Gagauz, to leave or be expelled from Moldova.
The Supreme Council of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic followed through on main three demands: on August 31, 1989 it adopted Moldovan as the only official language, while retaining Russian for secondary purposes; it introduced the Latin alphabet; and it declared a shared Moldovan-Romanian linguistic identity. The publicly stated intentions of the Moldovan authorities to bring the country closer to Romania, as well as the ethnocentric rhetoric of the Popular Front, provoked serious concerns of ethnic minorities in the country. Transnistria's population was predominantly Slav – 60% were Ukrainians and Russians, while less than 40% were ethnic Moldovans. The overall majority of the population, including some ethnic Moldovans, spoke Russian as their mother tongue.
The nationalist Popular Front won the first free parliamentary elections in the Moldavian SSR in the spring of 1990. On 2 September 1990, the Second Congress of the Peoples' Representatives of Transnistria proclaimed the creation of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. Violence escalated when in October 1990, the Popular Front called for volunteers to form armed militias to stop an autonomy referendum in Gagauzia. In response, volunteer militias were formed in Transnistria.
Limited armed clashes between Transnistrian militia and Moldova started in November of 1990. Volunteers from Russia came to support Transnistrians.In early 1992, the fighting intensified. The former Soviet 14th Guards Army, stationed in Transnistiria, which remained neutral throughout the fighting, entered the conflict in its final stage, swearing allegiance to Transnistrian authorities and opening fire against Moldovan forces. A ceasefire agreement was signed on 21 July 1992 and has held to the present day.
The history of the emergence of the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic holds several striking similarities with the current conflict in Ukraine. There, the people of the Donetsk and Lugansk oblasts in eastern Ukraine rebelled against the nationalist rhetoric of the Euromaidan movement and the government brought to power through a coup d'état on February 21-22, 2014. One of the first steps of that government was to abolish the existing law on languages in Ukraine granting Russian a special status in Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine. Ukrainian is the only official language in Ukraine. Changes to the language law in 2013 granted Russian a special status in areas of majority or large minority Russian speakers, but the law was bitterly opposed by Ukrainian nationalists.
Another similarity is the linguistic profiles of Ukraine and Moldova. Like Transnistria, where the majority of population speaks Russian, Donetsk and Lugansk regions are the only regions of Ukraine, where Russian language is spoken by the large majority of the population. Population of these regions of Ukraine has always been close to Russia culturally, as with the population of Transnistria. Russian volunteers poured into Transnistria to help locals to defend their rights against Moldovan nationalism; in the same way 20 years later, Donetsk and Lugansk received the support of volunteers from Russia in their fight against Ukrainian nationalism and against a forceful integration into the European Union by the coup government that came to power in 2014. They wanted closer ties with Russia. However, Russia has not officially recognized the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, as it has not recognized the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. Russia does provide extensive humanitarian assistance to both entities and maintains extensive economic and cultural relations.
Moldova has not officially recognized Transnistria. But at least it stopped waging war against against the breakaway republic, and it has settled into an uneasy coexistence. The relations between Moldova and Transnistria are often characterized as a “frozen conflict”. All attempts to find a formula for political settlement of the unrecognized status of the PMR between the PMR and Moldova have not produced any result.
Since independence in 1991, Moldova, like Ukraine some 20 years later, set out on a course of economic integration into the European Union. Even the so-called ‘pro-Russian' Moldovan presidents over the years, such as Vladimir Voronin (2001-2009), followed this course very closely. For example, in 2003, Voronin refused to sign a memorandum proposed by the Russian Federation outlining plans for a unification of Moldova and the PMR into a federal state of Moldova. Voronin stated that since Moldova plans to join European Union, such a plan needed the approval of ‘European structures', beginning with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe', and therefore they could not endorse it.
In the current conflict between Kyiv and Donetsk and Lugansk republics, Russian officials have stated on many occasions that the two republics (comprising the historic industrial region called ‘Donbass') should be granted a large autonomy within a unitary Ukraine, in spite of the evident desire of the populations of the two breakaway republics to desire to integrate into the Russian Federation.
The ceasefire and political-settlement agreement signed in Minsk, Belarus on Feb 12, 2015 (termed ‘Minsk-2', text here) with the endorsement of France, Germany, and Russia, outline beginning principles of this autonomy, but Kyiv has been stubbornly sabotaging the agreement.
The new president of Moldova, Igor Dodon, is proving themselves a wiser and more mature politician compared to Ukrainian leaders, as shown by their visit to the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic. They declared that Moldova under their presidency will remain a neutral country, not choosing between European Union or Russia. The population of Moldova, like the population of Ukraine, has always been split in its political and cultural sympathies towards Europe and Russia. Most Moldovans and probably a majority of Ukrainians believe the best way to keep their country safe and whole is by preserving a neutral status between the EU and the Russia-dominated Eurasian Economic Union to the east. Dodon has demonstrated a practical approach of compromise and negotiation in the interests of the population of both Moldova and the PMR.
Kyiv should follow Dodon's example because it is the only path to peace in Ukraine. Unfortunately, the current political regime in Kyiv is unlikely to do that. The news of Dodon's meeting with the president of the PMR was not even reported by mainstream Ukrainian media.
The recent call of one of the richest Ukrainian oligarchs, Viktor Pinchuk, to make painful compromises with Russia and implement Minsk-2 and return to a neutral status for Ukraine to reach peace in Donbass, has been repudiated by Poroshenko's administration. Konstantin Eliseev, the deputy head of the Presidential Administration, stated that Ukraine will never turn away from integration into the European Union and NATO . (See my Dec 31, 2016 article ‘ Prominent member of Ukraine's elite issues call for peace in Donbass'.)
But to the ongoing consternation of officials of the Kyiv government, full membership of Ukraine in the European Union has always been treated cautiously and even reluctantly by European Union officials. They have used the idea to foment conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which is not the same as supporting and facilitation it, as Ukrainians are today learning.
Ukrainians blindly mistook a loose economic association with Europe as being a step toward an inevitable, full integration into the European Union. They naively hoped that the European Union will solve the economic disaster that the country became following independence in 1991, particularly following the failed ‘Orange Revolution' of 2005 in which competing interests among the country's economic elite fought for domination amidst a backdrop of deep, social protest by ordinary Ukrainians.
This blind, naïve hope has brought further economic disaster and civil war in Ukraine. The official Ukrainian propaganda blames Russia for all of the troubles beginning in 2013 and it refuses to recognize Kyiv's fault in its unleashing of a so-called Anti-Terrorist Operation (complete with its own, catchy acronym—the ‘ATO') against its own people. Kyiv relied heavily on U.S. support in the conflict with Russia. Now, that support may dwindle if President-elect Donald Trump carries through their various, offhand statements that they are interested in seeking improved relations with Russia.
Kyiv should review its categorical refusal to accommodate Donetsk and Lugansk if it wants to keep Donbass within Ukraine. Otherwise the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics will follow the path of the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic in exercising a permanent autonomy. It is a very plausible scenario, given the fact that the conflict in Donbass has been frozen for more than two years and Ukraine continues to punish the two republics with unceasing artillery fire and a punishing economic blockade.
Do conservatives really want to repeal ObamaCare?
And if not, why not?
John C. Goodman of the Goodman Institute, and one of the first economists to promote Health Savings Accounts (HSA), asks, and answers, that question:
Probably not. Here's why: virtually every conservative health policy analyst advising Republican candidates and Republican office holders believes in the same model Barack Obama believes in. Then there is managed competition. Technically, this is a system in which enrollees can periodically choose to switch health plans (usually once year) and the plans must accept all comers and charge a community rated premium, irrespective of the expected costs for any enrollee. Although the system might appear to be based on sound economic principles (after all, there is the word “competition”), in fact the restrictions create perverse incentives for everyone in the market. Buyers who are overcharged (mainly the healthy) have an incentive to under-insure. Buyers who are undercharged (mainly the sick) have an incentive to over-insure. On the seller side, health plans have an incentive to attract the healthy (on whom they make a profit) and avoid the sick (on whom they incur losses). After enrollment, health plans have an incentive to over-provide to the healthy (to keep the ones they have and attract more of them) and under-provide to the sick (to encourage the exodus of the ones they have and discourage enrollment by any more of them). This is, of course, exactly what we are seeing in the exchanges – with a race to the bottom on the part of the insurers, reflected in high deductibles and narrow networks that omit the best doctors and the best facilities. Academic studies have borne out the analysis my colleagues and I initiated more than two decades ago. For example, a study by scholars at Harvard and the University of Texas found that insurers are using high out-of-pocket prescription drug costs to deter certain chronically-ill patients from joining their plans.
Read the whole thing here. (Note I don't agree with all of Dr. Goodman's policy recommendations, as they seem to accept the necessity and even benefits of a government role in health care, but I do think the article makes some important points).
So why do so many Republicans and conservatives favor a health care system based on (government-) managed competition? I believe there are several reasons.
First, most Republicans, and a surprising number of conservative intellectuals, are not interested in health care policy. This is reflected in the fact that, outside of a notable few politicians and policy wonks, Republican and conservative health care policy is reactive--Democrats propose HillaryCare or ObamaCare, Republicans come up with a response. Senior citizens demand prescription drug benefits, so Republicans come up with their own plan and add Health Savings Accounts to it as a sweetener to get conservative votes. So when presented with the conventional idea that managed competition is the only sustainable health care system, your typical Republican will shrug and say, "It must be good, it has the word competition in it."
The second reason (and it is related to the first, but it also applies to issues besides health care) is that too many Republicans and conservatives lack the political courage or intellectual understanding challenging the left's claims that health care is a "right" that must be provided by government. This leads them to look for solutions involving government management of health care, especially ones that have the word "competition" in them.
The lack of understanding of economic principles also leads Republicans--just like Democrats-- to misdiagnose the problem with health care. Instead of recognizing government interference as the major problem, too many Republicans join Democrats, resulting in too many people lacking quality, affordable healthcare.
But health insurance is a means to care, not the end. Government policies have caused the dysfunction we see in healthcare today by encouraging over-reliance on insurance for even routine medical expenses. Think about it, when you go get your oil changed you do not file a claim with your auto insurance company, so why should you file a claim with your health insurance company when you go for a routine check-up?
(The excessive reliance on insurance to cover routine expenses may be coming to an end, as more doctors are refusing to accept insurance. Once again we see the market being ahead of the politicians.)
Another way conservatives and republicans misdiagnosed health care policy is by assuming that the problem arises from America spending "too much." But the problem is not that individuals overspend on consumer health care, but that their spending and consumption decisions are distorted by government policies.
Those who have generous insurance policies may spend more than they would in a free-market, but those who cannot obtain health insurance, or whose insurance company limits their consumption, may spend less than they would in a free-market. The question is not what is the "proper" level of spending, but whether the decisions on how much to spend, and on what type of health care, are made by individuals acting in a free-market. After all, in a prosperous free-market, why wouldn't individuals spend generously on health care for themselves and their families--as well as generously give to charities to provide health care for the less fortunate?
The failure to understand or advocate for a free-market leads Republicans to advocate policies, such as "managed" competition or limits on health care tax cuts or credits, designed to limit how much individuals spend on health care. These policies are rooted in the same philosophical error that ObamaCare is: the idea that government bureaucrats are capable of determining the proper amount of health care spending and can design a system capable of providing exactly the right amount of health care at exactly the right price.
The good news is that politicians can be made to embrace free-market health care if enough people come to understand the economics of liberty and join the effort to force politicians to adopt true free-market polices. This is the mission of Campaign for Liberty. Please support our efforts.

A program that helps low-income Nova Scotians buy medication is being axed, but the province says funding will still be available to them through different channels.
Three hundred people were enrolled in the extended pharmacare program, which the Department of Community Services announced Tuesday it would be phasing out. The program charged people $5 for prescription co-payments.
Those people will keep their current benefits, according to a news release from the department.
However, new clients who apply for help will be streamed into the family pharmacare program along with 34,000 other Nova Scotians. They will be charged 20 per cent of the cost of each prescription, plus deductibles based on family size and annual income.
If they can't cover those costs, help can come through a special fund in the social assistance program, said department spokesperson Lori Errington.
"The social worker can have Community Services assist with the cost of co-payments on prescriptions as a 'special need,'" they wrote in an email.
"Say you're on [social assistance] and needed a walking cast or to get a tooth pulled or some other necessary expense — you can have that covered as a 'special need' over and above your regular monthly payment."
Discontinuing the current program is a way to streamline services, leaving all the province's pharmacare services managed by the Department of Health and Wellness, said Errington.
The extended pharmacare program, created in 2001, predated the family pharmacare program by seven years. Enrolment has declined by about 10 per cent every year to about 70 people annually in the last few years, said Errington.
Its clients didn't qualify for income assistance, but still struggled to pay their drug costs, said the release. That included people with disabilities and children in the child welfare program.
New Delhi: Putting an end to all speculations, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday returned to Delhi from Europe trip.
A reshuffle of All India Congress Committee (AICC) office-bearers is likely now as the Congress leader is now returned from the foreign trip.  They are likely to be elevated to the party's president post now.
Rahul Gandhi, whose foreign trips in the past have led to intense speculation, on Dec 28, had informed about their Europe trip through Twitter.
“I will be traveling to Europe for a few days. A very Happy New Year to everyone,” they said.
“Hope the new year brings much joy and happiness to you and everyone close to you!,” they wished.
I will be traveling to Europe for a few days. A very Happy New Year to everyone (1/2) — Office of RG (@OfficeOfRG) December 28, 2015
Hope the new year brings much joy and happiness to you and everyone close to you! (2/2) — Office of RG (@OfficeOfRG) December 28, 2015
This was the first time that Rahul Gandhi has tweeted to make public their plan to travel abroad.
Their last two trips abroad were much talked about. Their around two-month sabbatical after an AICC session in February this year to reflect upon the party's debacle in Delhi elections and deliberate on a future course for Congress had led to BJP taking potshots at him.
In the roughly two months since the release of Windows 8, the adoption rate of Microsoft's latest flagship operating system appears to be trailing Window Vista, until now the slowest OS rollout in the software giant's recent history.
Data compiled by Web analytics firm Net Applications put Windows 8's online usage share at just under 1.6 percent through Dec. 22 as measured in relation to all desktop and laptop PC operating systems. Microsoft made its next-gen PC and tablet platform available on Oct. 26. Computerworld's Gregg Keizer tabbed back through the data to find that Vista, after the same period of time following its 2007 release, had shown up on 2.2 percent of all Windows systems (you can access the same data by clicking back through the Net Application report.)
More bad news for Microsoftthe adoption of Windows 8 on PCs only grew by about 0.4 percentage points from Nov. 22 to Dec. 22. In the second month after Vista's release, adoption of the much maligned OS had doubled from the end of its first month, Keizer noted.
Net Applications also measures the online usage share of operating systems for all major computing system device types, including smartphones, tablets, and game consoles in addition to PCs. When you account for all of those hardware platforms, Microsoft's flashy new OS currently has about a 1.4 percent share of the overall OS market.
Other researchers and even some Microsoft OEM partners have recently warned that the uptake of Windows 8 was proceeding slowly in the early going, though Redmond said in late November that it had already sold 40 million Windows 8 licenses.
An overall decline in new PC sales in 2012 relative to corresponding growth in the sales of mobile devices like tablets and smartphones may partially account for the seeming discrepancy between Microsoft's story and that of some key hardware partners. It's not clear how many of the tens of millions of Windows 8 license sales the software giant has reported were for brand-new PCs, tablets, and a new class of hybrid devices versus upgrades on previously owned systems.
If Windows 8's initial adoption rate appears to be moving at an almost glacial pace, it's almost unimaginable that the new OS will follow Vista's disastrous path for too long. Nearly six years after Vista's releaseand more than three years after the release of Service Pack 2, the bridge between Windows XP and Windows 7 has a meager 5.49 percent share of the desktop OS market, according to Net Application.
The analytics firm currently has Windows 7 with a 45.6 percent share of the PC operating system market while the amazingly enduring Windows XPeasily Microsoft's most successful enterprise product everwas holding on to just over 39 percent through Dec. 22.
With Microsoft planning to pull in release dates of future-generation Windows platforms Windows 9, code named Blue, could be coming as soon as mid-2013 it may be that Redmond never again owns the market so fully with a single OS as it did with XP or even Windows 7 for that matter.
Even so, Windows 8 surely can't fare as poorly as Vista has ... can it?

The two security guards have been arrested.
A 30-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped at a tennis club in Bengaluru on Wednesday night.Two security guards have been arrested.The woman had come on Tuesday for a membership at the club located near the city's well-known Cubbon Park. The police say they decided to stay the night near the club as they had come from Tumkur, over 70 km away.The guards allegedly spotted the woman at the parking lot of the club and approached her, offering to help them gain membership. They allegedly took them to a deserted stretch and assaulted her."Last night at around 3 am, a rape complaint was received at Cubbon Park," a senior police officer said.This is the third such incident in the IT city in a month. Earlier this month, a 19-year-old nurse was allegedly raped inside a moving bus by its driver at Hoskote. Last month, a 22-year-old call centre employee was gangraped by two men.
Mattel's Castle Grayskull reveal has spawned a new character in the Masters of the Universe mythos; Back-Lashor. The backlash over the decreased size of the Castle has been great and furious, and Mattel has decided to clear the extra air above its too-short walls.
Mattel's own Scott Neitlich took to the forums at He-Man.org and then proceeded to the MattyCollector.com Facebook page to address the growing and vocal concerns from disappointed people who have pre-ordered the Masters of the Universe Classics Castle Grayskull. Get a sandwich and a drink before sitting down to read their comments, because unlike Castle Grayskull, they're anything but "too short".
Clearing the Air on Castle Grayskull
Hey They Fan and They Ravers,
With a lot going on right now (Filmation, Castle, end of the Mayan Calendar etc...) I wanted to try and reach out and clear the air. Their are a lot of posts floating around and some concern that I hope I can clear up.
First off. Loud and clear. I know some fans/customers want the Castle to be larger or at the least as large as the initial B-sheet and foam model and dimensions given on the Castle's pre sale page. Now to bring this to the "legal base level" we did make it clear on the pre sale page that all size dimnesions were estimates and subject to change. The Castle from day one has been an unpresedented project. I mean come on, selling in a 6" playset from a drawing B sheet? Who does that? And having a fan base strong enough to make this a reality? Only He-Fans are that strong!
I wish we could make the Castle bigger, I really do. And I totally understand some fans/customers want this as well. Bottom line, is that based on the price of $250.00, the current sculpt is 100% the biggest we can get. Yes. It is an inch or two smaller than the dimensions given at presale. And 100% we still expect some changes to happen (not neccessarily to the size but possibly to some of the accessories). We are committed to making sure to update everyone as the process continues to be as upfront as possible on any changes coming through.
In no way is anyone trying to hoodwink or scam anyone. As I said. This entire process is very unprecendented. Change is inevitable. The Castle will continue to evolve but everyone working on it from me, to the Horsemen to Ruben and Mario from design and so forth are completely committed to devliering the best playset we possibly can. In no way do we expect to please 100% of the fans. With fans as passionate as MOTU fans, no one expects to do that. We are not secretly trying to bring down the brand. (never seem to understand where that comes from to tell you the truth!) Why would I do anything to prevent more cool MOTU collector product from being made? After all, I am a collector too you know!
And I know my answers can many times come across as "corporate". A lot of that is just circumstantial. Many of my answers have to go thorugh the "PR machine" and get approved. I try to joke it up when I can (like mentioning that the Flag can be placed in your fridge) but if my tone offends anyone, please just know that I don't have 100% control over messaging even I put out. If we are saying "no" to fan suggestions, it doesn't mean we disagree with the suggestion, it often just means it is just not something possible.
I often wish I had a magic wand and could just make the perfect toy happen. As is; we are fighting day in and day out to make the entire MOTUC line (including the Castle) the best it can be. I think when folks see the final model in San Diego, fears that the size is not up to snuff will be dilutted. Those who were in person at NYTF (i.e. Val, Dan) have been pretty vocal that the castle is huge. Yes, it is slightly smaller vs the foam model, but that is just part of the toy making process.
And to reassure everoyne that we are not trying to "pull a fast one" note that you can 100% cancel your order all the way through Aug 30 if in any way the ev er evolving playset does not meet your needs. (but note when you cancel, you can not then go back and reinstate, so do think carefully).
In the end, this is going to be an amazing peice and I hope will please the majority of fans. We are actively working on the following changes from what was shown at NYTF:
Beyond that, their just is not time or resources to make changes. We 100% hear fans on many suggestions, but when we say "no we can't make that change" it is not meant as an insult, it is just letting fans/customers know that factually that change can't be made. If I gave the impression that the model shown in NY was going to change, then bad on me. But to be clear now, their won't be changes beyond what was shown and noted above. We hope everything shown in NY will be in the final toy, but their is always a chance things may change/get cut. If that does happen, we will be sure to let everyone know.
Looking ahead, boy do we have amazing things coming down! Club Filmation, SDCC exclusives (to be revealed in late Spring) and the 2014 line is shapping up well. I have worked with the team to create a new roadmap that if we get a 2014 and 2015 line should wrap up the vintage lines and most of the major fan requested animated figs. It doesn't mean we won't get to more in 2016 and beyond, but with rising costs we wanted to do all we can to get to the vintage line in the next two years.
A lot more is still to come in 2013. We won't know more about 2014 until after the sub sell in at SDCC this summer. I'll try to get on the boards this weekend and jump in on RGD if I can. We've got so much good stuff to look forward to, I am nothing but grinning ear to ear.

The anatomical snuff box or snuffbox is a triangular deepening on the radial, dorsal aspect of the hand—at the level of the carpal bones, specifically, the scaphoid and trapezium bones forming the floor. The name originates from the use of this surface for placing and then sniffing powdered tobacco, or "snuff." It is sometimes referred to by its French name tabatière.
Structure [ edit ]
Boundaries [ edit ]
Neurovascular anatomy [ edit ]
Deep to the tendons which form the borders of the anatomical snuff box lies the radial artery, which passes through the anatomical snuffbox on its course from the normal radial pulse detecting area, to the proximal space in between the first and second metacarpals to contribute to the superficial and deep palmar arches. The cephalic vein arises within the anatomical snuffbox, while the dorsal cutaneous branch of the radial nerve can be palpated by stroking along the extensor pollicis longus with the dorsal aspect of a fingernail.
Clinical significance [ edit ]
The radius and scaphoid articulate deep to the snuffbox to form the basis of the wrist joint. In the event of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH), this is the area through which the brunt of the force will focus. This results in these two bones being the most often fractured of the wrist. In a case where there is localized tenderness within the snuffbox, knowledge of wrist anatomy leads to the speedy conclusion that the fracture is likely to be of the scaphoid. This is understandable as the scaphoid is a small, oddly shaped bone whose purpose is to facilitate mobility rather than confer stability to the wrist joint[citation needed]. In the event of inordinate application of force over the wrist, this small scaphoid is likely to be the weak link[citation needed]. Scaphoid fracture is one of the most frequent causes of medico-legal issues.
An anatomical anomaly in the vascular supply to the scaphoid is the area to which the blood supply is first delivered. Blood enters the scaphoid distally. Consequently, in the event of a fracture the proximal segment of the scaphoid will be devoid of a vascular supply, and will—if action is not taken—avascularly necrose within a sufferer's snuffbox. Due to the small size of the scaphoid and its shape, it is difficult to determine, early on, whether or not the scaphoid is indeed fractured with an x-ray. Further complications include; carpal instability (ligament disruption) and fracture-dislocations.

In a fiery statement after the Senate voted to advance a bill that would give President Obama fast track trade authority, Sen. Bernie Sanders hammered the Senate for siding with corporations while harming American workers.
After the Senate had voted 62-38 to advance a bill that would give President Obama fast track authority on trade, Sanders said:
The Senate just put the interests of powerful multi-national corporations, drug companies and Wall Street ahead of the needs of American workers. If this disastrous trade agreement is approved, it will throw Americans out of work while companies continue moving operations and good-paying jobs to low-wage countries overseas.
Bad trade deals like the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership are a major reason for the collapse of the American middle class and the increase in wealth and income inequality in the United States. This agreement, like bad trade deals before it, would force American workers to compete with desperate workers around the world – including workers in Vietnam where the minimum wage is 56-cents an hour.
Trade agreements should not just work for corporate America, Wall Street, and the pharmaceutical industry. They have got to benefit the working families of our country,” Sanders said. “We must defeat fast track and develop a new policy on trade.
Michael Wessel, who has read parts of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, wrote that TPP opponents like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are right to be concerned about the trade deal. Blank checks should not be given to any president. It is a lesson that the nation should have learned after the invasion of Iraq, but history is repeating itself on TPP.
History demonstrates that trade deals work out well for corporations, while harming workers. The country can't rebuild the middle-class while simultaneously cutting secret trade deals that prevent good middle-class jobs from being created. Sanders was correct. Sixty-two senators put corporate interests ahead of workers.
Sen. Sanders and the Democrats who voted no on moving the bill forward are the real champions for American workers.

SANTIAGO, Chile — For years, so many twins have been born in the small southern Brazilian town of Cândido Godói that residents wonder whether something mysterious lurks in the water, or even if Josef Mengele, the Nazi physician known as the Angel of Death, conducted experiments on the women there.
But a group of scientists now says it can rule out such long-rumored possibilities. Ursula Matte, a geneticist in Porto Alegre, Brazil, said a series of DNA tests conducted on about 30 families since 2009 found that a specific gene in the population of Cândido Godói appears more frequently in mothers of twins than in those without. The phenomenon is compounded by a high level of inbreeding among the population, which is composed almost entirely of German-speaking immigrants, they said.
“We analyzed six genes and found one gene that confirms, in this population, a predisposition to the birth of twins,” Dr. Matte said.
They were the first scientist to document, in a study published in the 1990s, that the rate of twin births in the town was unusually high. It was especially high in São Pedro, a village of about 350 residents that is part of Cândido Godói. Dr. Matte found that from 1990 to 1994, 10 percent of the births in São Pedro were twins, compared with less than 1 percent for Brazil as a whole.

The high concentration of twins has stirred outlandish theories. Residents say Mengele moved around southern Brazil in the 1960s, posing as a veterinarian, at about the time the twin births were thought to have really taken off. An Argentine journalist suggested in a 2008 book that Mengele conducted experiments on women in Cândido Godói that resulted in a baby boom of twins, many of whom have blond hair and light-colored eyes.
SAN FRANCISCO - Fake election news got more attention than did real stories on Facebook during the final months of the US presidential campaign, according to an analysis by BuzzFeed News.
Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that bogus stories shared at the social network paved a path of victory for President-elect Donald Trump
The tech news outlet found that the 20 top-performing bogus stories from hoax websites and extremely partisan blogs generated slightly more than 8.7 million shares, reactions and comments at the leading social network in the three months before the November 8 election.
In comparison, the 20 best-performing election stories from major news websites including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Huffington Post got just shy of 7.4 million shares, reactions and comments at Facebook, according to BuzzFeed.
Prior to the final three months of the presidential campaign, top election stories from major outlets had strongly outperformed fake news, BuzzFeed reported.
Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg last week rejected the idea that bogus stories shared at the social network paved a path of victory for Republican President-elect Donald Trump.
"The idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way I think is a pretty crazy idea," Zuckerberg said during an onstage chat at a Technonomy technology trends conference in California.
However, Zuckerberg added, Facebook has also found that people are less inclined to click on links or otherwise check out shared stories that did not line up with their views.
The News Feed at Facebook has evolved from the early days of being about sharing personal tidbits with friends or family to becoming a platform for important news.
Google and Facebook moved Tuesday to cut off advertising revenue to fake news sites, after a wave of criticism over the role misinformation played in the US presidential election.
The move by the two tech giants aims to choke off funds to an industry fueled by bogus, often sensational "news" circulating online and seen as a potential influence on public opinion.
Firstly, i've been able to write an article every few weeks for the student magazine about certain games that defined part of my childhood in the 90's.
Tomb Raider 2 was one of these, and the maagazine was finally published yesterday:
Pretty excited to finally see it published after a few weeks waiting 🙂
Due to the limited word count in the magazine, it's missing a few sections, especially the conclusion. So I thought i'd post the unedited version here, with some videos as well.
Click ‘Read More', and enjoy!
First, i want you to play this, and then start reading:
Tomb Raider 2 was a game that I couldn't wait to play at the end of 1997. The protagonist, Lara Croft and I were briefly introduced at a friend's house as they were facing off against a T. rex in their previous adventure. Even though I had the pleasure of trying out Crash Bandicoot 2 or Pandemonium 2 for the first time on Christmas day, Lara couldn't wait, and so it began.
Just like every Tomb Raider game of its era, it was non-linear, and involved you going back and forth to see where this key goes in which slot after hearing Lara give their trademark ‘No.' to you many times.
The main improvement in this game was to Lara herself. Added features now included the ability to climb walls, and you could also now drive vehicles. Improvements to their appearance were a fluid ponytail with random physics, which meant you were never quite sure as to which direction it would swing.
But no retrospective would be complete without talking about Lara's butler. In the training level, Lara's home, their ever-faithful butler followed Lara around their home, including a walk-in freezer, where you could lock them in. Due to a flaw in the graphics, their head would show through the locked door, desperately trying to escape. This was a great distraction from learning Lara's new moves, simple yet amusing.
The plot involved Lara Croft searching for the Dagger of Xian, which was said to give unlimited power to those who sacrificed themselves to the artefact. But Lara wasn't alone in finding this dagger. A boss called Marco Bartoli and their gang were also on the hunt for it, who you encountered throughout the game. The final two levels resulted in a showdown between Lara and Bartoli, which made for an action-packed conclusion.
In order to obtain the dagger to place on their shelf, you followed Lara across 18 levels.
These were split into 5 sections:
China, Venice, an oil rig, the ocean depths, and Tibet.
During these levels you faced against Bartoli's henchmen, tigers, spiders, floating guards, an Ice King, and many more.
A few levels to note here, starting with Venice, simply for the speedboat, while the Opera House, which if you managed to complete it in under a month you have my respect.
Finally Tibet, which was, and still is a favourite of mine, mainly for the snowmobiles.
Soon after this you encountered a floating island, before facing the game's final showdown split into two levels.
And if you heard ‘that' music, you simply just ran. Or blindly shot at air. Or both. It was another fantastic highlight, which was done by Nathan McCree for the first 3 games, and it gave you the sense of exploration and wonder, but also kept you on your toes. The game's high calibre voice acting also showed how you were taken in by Lara's voice.
This was one of the games that defined my gaming childhood, and it was the first game for my PlayStation 1 that I was fully immersed by.
The first one was nearly as good, and the third was so difficult in places that I had enough by the time I reached London.
After that, the series began to lose what made it so good. Tomb Raider Legend was a great action game, and Anniversary was a great tribute to the first game.
But with the new reboot appearing in March, it looks too familiar to LOST, and the sense of having realism as the forefront of this new Lara, takes away in a sense what made the original trilogy so immersive.
Tomb Raider 2 is a game I still play to this day, on PC or other platforms. And with it being 15 years this month since its original release, I urge you to dust off any copies you have of this. If you have a PlayStation 3/Vita, buy it as a classic, and enjoy it for what it is: the original Lara Croft in their best adventure.
Some of you had literally never heard about the National Security Agency (NSA) prior to recent revelations that they are so far up your ass that you can text them to find out the next time you can expect to take a shit . So what's it like to work at the NSA? Apparently it's really, really weird. At least that's the impression you get from Cryptolog, the NSA's bizarre internal journal that has the look and feel of something printed on the back of a Chuck E. Cheese's place mat. Old issues of the magazine were recently declassified and uploaded to the Web, and the thing is like Highlights , but dumber. In the average issue you could find ...

Whatever the NSA does, it must be serious business, because until very recently you almost never heard about them at all, while CIA operations became the stuff of constant headlines and blockbuster films. So we're talking about people who handle shit so sensitive that Hollywood barely even knows how to make a movie about them. You imagine a world of windowless rooms and retina scans, agents quietly mining phone records for signs of a terror plot. So the NSA's internal magazine must have been a series of terse commands in a stark black font under warnings that leaking it could result in Armageddon. Right?
Or it could look like this:

But even that shining example of '70s line art displayed far too many fucks for the NSA. At one point they let an author tape a pen to their flaccid penis and draw stick-figure comics. Do you think we're joking?
Five former U.S. ambassadors to Israel have said Donald Trump's choice of envoy is “unqualified for the position,” in an unprecedented diplomatic slap.
The group – a mix of Democratic and Republican presidential choices spanning three decades – joined forces this week in a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressing “concern” about David Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer who supports settlements.
Friedman has no diplomatic or political experience, but helped bail out Trump's businesses. They fund Jewish settlements in the West Bank and has said American Jews who support the establishment of a Palestinian state are “worse than kapos”, in reference to Jews who turned in other Jews in Nazi death camps. They also said President Obama and John Kerry were “anti-Semitic” and described the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as “morons”.

Among the five former ambassadors is Thomas Pickering, an influential figure who has been at the heart of U.S. national security and foreign policy decision making since working with Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in the 1970s.
In the letter, they say Friedman holds “extreme, radical positions” and thinks the two-state solution is an “illusory solution to a non-existent problem”. They questioned their “balance and the temperament,” saying an ambassador “must be dedicated to advancing our country's longstanding bipartisan goals in the region”.
They added: “If Israel is to carry on as a Jewish, democratic nation, respected internationally, we see no alternative to a two-state solution… We are concerned that Mr Friedman strongly disagrees.” They asked the Committee to carefully evaluate their appointment, saying: “We believe [Friedman] to be unqualified for the position.”

For a game that has seemingly been shrouded in mystery for a long while, No Man's Sky sure is surrounded by a huge amount of hype and anticipation. No Man's Sky is an upcoming adventure survival video game developed and published by the indie studio Hello Games. The game has had a few showings here and there but for the most part the only thing that's absolutely certain is the quintessential role that exploration plays in the game. It's now clear that there is a bit more depth to the game with players able to trade, fight, explore, and survive in a boundless, computer-generated universe.
Just recently, No Man's Sky was revealed to have a release date of June 21st and is now available to preorder for the PlayStation website here. Notably, the game is currently priced at a full retail price of $60 and is available to pre-order digitally or on physical media. Sean Murray from Hello Games said on the official PlayStation blog that
No Man's Sky will have a full blown Blu-ray retail version! Sony has a history of working closely with indies, and this feels like some sort of culmination of that story. It means more people will have a chance to join us in exploring the universe than ever before. I can't really imagine what it will feel like to walk into a shop and see our game on a shelf.
It's very rare and some might even say unprecedented for an independently developed indie game to get this kind of AAA treatment with a full $60 price tag and a blu-ray retail release. Hello Games has previously released mobile games including Joe Danger and Joe Danger 2: The Movie, but the quality of No Man's Sky is nowhere close to such titles and should fans really be shocked by the price of No Man's Sky? I think the problem lies more with the fact that No Man's Sky is blurring the lines between what we would define as “Indie” and “AAA” and that's why some people have been split over the decision.
This generation has set an unprecedented for Indie games already with the sheer amount of them available on consoles. Before this current generation, we would often come to expect more AA or AAA games to release throughout any given month in the last generation of consoles but the rise of the Indie realm has certainly had its effect on current gen consoles and we currently see them vastly outnumber bigger titles available on both major systems. There have been some real gems among this influx of Indie titles such as Ori and the Blind Forest, Transistor, Oxenfree, Rocket League and more but none of these have been priced at $60 and thus setting a new precedent with No Man's Sky.
Don't misunderstand me, Indie titles bring some truly great, unique experiences to consoles that otherwise AAA games alone would not be able to capture and the focus on Indie games, especially by Sony has been welcome this gen in introducing and promoting many quality smaller titles that many might have otherwise neglected. However, this surge of Indie games and just their pricing history has imprinted a belief in the minds of many that Indie titles should cost around $20 (or local equivalent). Jonathan Blow's latest game The Witness which was priced at $40 recently raised the bar for the pricing of Indie games but even at $40 many still complained.
For obvious reasons, I cannot speak on behalf of all of those who have been complaining about the $60 price tag for No Man's Sky but if I had to venture a guess I would attribute this to the fact that there is a conception in the minds of some that Indie games don't offer the quality or depth that a full priced AAA game offers. However, if anything, No Man's Sky in particular seems to buck this trend. I cannot even conceive of a AAA game that has promised the same amount of virtually limitless exploration that No Man's Sky boasts so why is it that some of us can't get over that $60 price tag.
There's no denying that No Man's Sky is going to be huge, it's so big that there will be about 18 billion unique and explorable planets. So huge that if everyone on Earth were to discover 500 planets per minute in No Man's Sky, it would still take around 10 years to discover every planet. While there are doubts over exactly how unique these different planets will be from one another and how much variety will be offered, it remains clear that the team behind No Man's Sky has indisputably gone to great lengths to forge this kind of exploration-driven experience with No Man's Sky.
Before you make any hasty comments or decisions please remember that Hello Games is a very small studio and to create something this ambitious truly is something quite unprecedented for the Indie market. Some will be deterred by the $60 price tag but if you've been excited about No Man's Sky then I wouldn't allow something as nonsensical as a $60 price tag deter you from enjoying a game you had been looking forward to. No Man's Sky is due out this summer and while it will be sensible to wait what the verdicts are upon release, the ambition and scope of the game alone justify the price tag so don't get too hung up on it as No Man's Sky may be laying the groundwork for more ambitious big-scale “Indie” games that also blur the lines between what we define as “Indie” or “AAA” and that is an exciting future as long as the game is worthy of the full price tag.
How do you feel about No Man's Sky shaking up what it means to be an “Indie” game? Let us know your thoughts and opinions in the comments below.
NEW YORK (AP) — Acknowledging that games have gotten even slower this season, Commissioner Rob Manfred says MLB with will meet with players in an attempt to find a solution.
The average time of a nine-inning game is a record 3 hours, 5 minutes this season, up from 3 hours last year and 2:56 in 2015, Manfred's first season as commissioner.
“We've probably gone backwards a little bit,” Manfred said Thursday after an owners' meeting.
Management proposed making changes for this year, such as installing pitch clocks and limiting trips to the mound by catchers, but players' association head Tony Clark said their side would not agree. Management can implement changes unilaterally with one-year advance notice.
“We've had extensive conversations with Tony about a process for putting a series of meetings together to try to advance the ball on the pace-of-game issues,” Manfred said. “We remain committed to the idea ... there are things that can be done to try to improve on the pace-of-game topic. And we will continue to purse that agenda with Tony over the course of the season.”
Manfred wouldn't get into specifics.
“We need to let that process play out,” they said. “Tony has told me that players have their own suggestions about things that might happen. And I think it's best for us to receive those, have some conversations before we get into speculating about what might happen.
The Federal Transit Administration has offered grants to a First Avenue streetcar line, Community Transit's Swift 2 bus-rapid transit line, and Northgate-Lynnwood Link light rail. The grants would have to be approved by Congress first, but history suggest that will happen.
Uncle Sam is offering to contribute $1.2 billion toward Sound Transit's light-rail line from Northgate to Lynnwood, according to the president's proposed budget — just one of three huge transit gifts in the pipeline for Puget Sound travelers.
The proposed First Avenue streetcar line could win another $75 million in federal money, which suddenly places Seattle's third streetcar corridor on the political fast track.
And the feds want to give an additional $43 million toward Community Transit's Swift 2 bus-rapid transit line connecting Bothell, Mill Creek, Everett's McCollum Park and Paine Field.
The three awards, and many others proposed around the country by the Federal Transit Administration, must still be ratified by Congress in its transportation budget.
Each represents at least half the capital cost, and would stoke the transit-construction frenzy under way throughout the region.
Sound Transit is already building a new Northgate Station, to open in 2021, followed by plans to reach North Seattle, Shoreline, Mountlake Terrace and Lynn­wood with another 8½ miles of track by 2023, for a total $2.35 billion. The local share of the money comes mostly from sales taxes, approved by voters in 2008.
Estimated ridership in the Northgate-Lynnwood extension is 50,500 daily passengers the first year, and 67,100 trips by 2035, an FTA summary says.
Despite budget skirmishes between Democratic President Obama and a Republican-majority Congress, history suggests the transit grants have a high likelihood of happening.
The Federal Transit Administration's Small Starts and New Starts programs rolled along under Republican administrations before Obama. The projects are sprinkled around many regions and congressional districts, and they tend to fly under the radar. In 2006, the George W. Bush administration supported $750 million for Sound Transit's Capitol Hill Tunnel, and in 2003 the initial Seattle-Tukwila route won $500 million despite open criticism from some House conservatives, who said that light rail won't reduce traffic congestion.
“It's never a done deal, until it's done,” said Sound Transit spokesperson Bruce Gray. But they pointed out that U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., has often looked out for the projects on committees where they serve.
Sound Transit has previously won more than $1.3 billion in light-rail grants from FTA. Last month Peter Rogoff, who headed the FTA, moved to Seattle to become CEO of Sound Transit — which can only help it compete for future grants.
If it arrives, a $1.2 billion grant would far exceed the $600 million or so that Sound Transit assumed the feds might provide, when voters in 2008 approved a tax increase for three suburban routes.
It's too early to know whether a huge grant could free up cash for other Snohomish County lines and stations.
What it does provide is more assurance the Lynn­wood line will be delivered as promised, said Everett City Councilmember Paul Roberts, vice chairperson of Sound Transit's governing board.
“We're happy to be on track at this time,” they said.
Maggie Fimia, a longtime critic of Sound Transit, said the award isn't surprising given the agency's political lobbying clout.
“That's $1.2 billion that could have gone to local transit agencies, and it's not serving anywhere near the majority of transit users. Even by 2040, 90 percent of the transit rides will be on buses,” said Fimia, a member of the Coalition for Effective Transportation Alternatives.
Seattle's streetcar line, also known as the Center City Connector, would start at McGraw Square (Westlake Avenue at Stewart Street), turn toward the waterfront, then run on First Avenue to Pioneer Square. That route connects the 2007 South Lake Union streetcar to the just-opened First Hill line, though a fraction of users would travel the entire loop.
A big question is where the city can find another $60 million or so to complete the $135 million budget for construction and trains.
A local funding plan will be released later this year, said Rick Sheridan, spokesperson for the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT).
Streetcars are divisive enough politically that Mayor Ed Murray didn't include them in the recently passed $972 million Move Seattle levy, which focused mainly on street rebuilds and safety.
Sheridan said the SDOT does not intend to use Move Seattle funds. To supplant property-tax money, and spend it on streetcars, would require an 8-1 City Council vote, under last year's ballot ordinance.
Learning from the past, the City Council has resolved that any First Avenue line would run predominantly in its own transit lanes, instead of bogging down in slow general traffic like the first two lines.
Nonetheless, streetcar critics argue that new-generation trolley buses are equally comfortable at a lower cost, and that other transportation methods such as sidewalks, pavement or general bus service are more important.
Operating costs are also a potential headache. The South Lake Union line has needed three infusions of city loans in its first eight years, as operating costs outpace fare and advertising revenues.
In its application for federal money, the SDOT said a full three-line network could be linked by 2019 and serve as many as 25,000 daily passengers. Those include niche markets of tourists, sports fans, and commuters using the Marion Street footbridge to the state ferry terminal.
The planned Swift 2 line, similar to RapidRide within King County, would crisscross the Swift 1 line that now serves Highway 99, as promised in a sales-tax measure that barely passed last fall. Swift buses offer new mobility options to thousands of residents, especially those at apartment clusters that surround Snohomish County's main boulevards.
A leader with the Islamic State terrorist group has warned Muslims to stay away from Christian gatherings in Egypt, as the group is planning to carry out more massacres in the coming months.
"We are warning you to stay away from Christian gatherings, as well as the gatherings of the army and the police, and the areas that have political government facilities", the leader, who was not named, said in an interview in the ISIS Al Naba weekly newspaper, according to the MailOnline.
The warning comes less than a month after 49 were people killed in twin attacks on churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday. ISIS took responsibility for the bombings, which have since been recognized as the deadliest attack against Egypt's Coptic Christians in years.
Three days later, extremists slit the throat of a 16-year-old Coptic Christian boy in an attempt to further intimidate believers ahead of Easter, as reported by GH. The group also claimed responsibility for the December bombing of a church adjacent to St. Mark's Cathedral in Cairo, one of the most symbolic religious sites for Egyptian Copts. That explosion killed 30 worshippers and injured dozens.
AUBURN, Ala. -- For a couple of weeks in the blistering August heat of 2012, Jovon Robinson was an Auburn football player.
Robinson had a monster first season at GMC.
If the current Auburn staff gets its wish, the former running back signee will return in January.
The record-breaking junior college star spoke with Auburn coach Gus Malzahn, offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee and running backs coach Tim Horton Wednesday.
“It actually surprised me because I wasn't expecting it,” Robinson said. “Auburn has always been one of my favorite schools, but when they called it really spiked my interest a little bit more.”
Robinson, who is rated a 5-star and the nation's No. 1 junior college prospect by 247Sports, has a long-standing relationship with Malzahn, who started recruiting them nearly five year ago.
“I've always liked coach Malzahn,” Robinson said. “He was actually the first coach, OC to recruit me out of high school. They came to my high school when I was in 11th grade and told me I could do some special things with him.
“Me and Malzahn, our relationship has been kind of older. As good as it was back then, it can be better now.”
Robinson signed with Auburn in 2012 out of Wooddale in Memphis, Tenn. They reported to Auburn that summer and went through the first couple of weeks of preseason practice before being ruled academically ineligible after it was discovered that at least one of their high school grades had been changed by a Wooddale guidance counselor.
Robinson said they don't harbor any resentment for how things went down at Auburn a couple of years ago.
Robinson practiced for a couple of weeks at Auburn.
“It's still the same for me. You can assume that Auburn really was the best fit for me,” they said. “I'm still the same person. I've been the same player since high school. It's more being consistent for me, not trying to prove anything. It would be nice to say, ‘I got a chip,' but I've been the same person since I was eight years old. I'm just trying to get better and better.”
Of course, Robinson liked the potential of Auburn's offense coming out of high school and feels the same about it now.
“It's explosive,” they said. “They spread the ball around. They have guys running around the edges, going deep. It's really a fun offense to watch. It's actually something like I'm doing at GMC. It's one of the more diverse offenses for running backs."
Robinson plans to visit Auburn next weekend.
Robinson, 5-foot-11 and 225 pounds, had a monster first season at Georgia Military College in Milledgeville, Ga., last fall with a junior college record 2,387 rushing yards and 34 touchdowns on 272 carries, earning NJCAA Offensive Player of the Year honors. They led GMC to an 11-1 record as a first-year student, losing to East Mississippi 52-32 in the NJCAA championship game.
Robinson, who is a December graduate, lists a top five, all even, of Auburn, Alabama, Georgia, Florida State and Tennessee. Here's what they had to say about their other four top schools.
Alabama: “I like the role of the running back there. I know some of the coaching staff and the relationship is already there. It's actually closer to my home so it wouldn't be a lot of traveling for my family.”
Florida State: “They won a national championship and that's always a plus. They have an amazing quarterback. Their offense is kind of spread. I've never been out to Florida State so I'm looking forward to that. Definitely going to try and get down there this spring.”
Georgia: “It's basically the same thing as Alabama, the running back is kind of the focus of the offense. I've actually Georgia a couple of times so I know about the campus and I know some of the players personally, which is always good.”
Tennessee: “I haven't done much research on Tennessee yet. They haven't pursued my or treated me as important as much as the other schools yet. I do know Tennessee has a solid program and there is a significant role for the running backs there.”
Robinson hopes to have a decision before the start of their sophomore season.
“Just figuring out a new offense and building relationships is what I'm looking forward to,” they said.
Auburn signed two players out of GMC in the 2014 class in defensive linemen DaVonte Lambert and Devaroe Lawrence.

Many of you reading this site who also lived through the 1970s as an adult probably have share your of wild stories involving cocaine. That subset of readers is probably aware of the quirky way that McDonald's inadvertently created a piece of cocaine paraphernalia and even became almost synonymous with cocaine in certain contexts. The rest of you, maybe not so much.
In the late 1970s, McDonald's introduced a combination coffee spoon/stirrer that had the company's name on the handle and a tiny egg-shaped bowl or scoop on one end, while the other end was proudly crowned with the company's double arches logo. Basically this spoon was, quite by accident, absolutely perfect for use as a coke spoon. The scoop could hold precisely 100 milligrams of cocaine, some have claimed, which made it an ideal measuring device in addition to providing an easy way for coke addicts to snort the stuff. And America's largest corporations had just deposited countless millions of them all across the country. It was inevitable that cheeky cocaine users would adopt it.
Inadvertently, McDonald's had created the People's Coke Spoon.
Remarkably, the adoption of the McDonald's stirrers as a helpful cocaine device was not limited to the product's user base. Far from it. According to Barbara Mikkelson at snopes.com (which has confirmed the story), “The practice of using these implements in such fashion became so widespread that at least in some cities, a dose of cocaine was dubbed a ‘McSpoon' because it came packaged in the tiny coffee stirrers from McDonald's restaurants. ... In 1992 an undercover detective in Columbus, Ohio, said McSpoons were commonly sold ten to a bundle in that town and twelve to a bundle in Detroit” (emphasis added).
Understandably, McDonald's wasn't thrilled to see their fine name being used as shorthand for one of the most widespread Schedule II controlled substances as defined by the Drug Enforcement Agency. Eventually the McDonald's spoon became a flat coffee stirrer. According to snopes.com, a spokesperson for McDonald's Corp. named Doug Timberlake stated at the time that the fast-food chain had chosen to redesign its spoons because “It has been brought to our attention that people are using them illegally and illicitly for purposes for which they are not intended.”
Three of the McSpoons alongside three of the redesigned flat version
According to a pretty entertaining reddit thread about the “McSpoon,” it was common for coke users to “break away the long middle section and melt the little spoon end to the McDonald's logo.” When another user asks why on earth anyone would go to so much trouble, the response given is, “You did it so it would fit in a cigarette box.” If you click here you can see what I believe is a Photoshopped image representing what that would look like, I don't think it's a photograph of such a stirrer.
Understandably, the “McSpoon” has become the nostalgia artifact for some people. Right now you can buy a lot of 50 McSpoons for $60 on eBay.
In 2005 the artists Tobias Wong and “Ju$t Another Rich Kid” (founded by Ken Courtney) teamed up to create Coke Spoon 02, from “the Indulgent series,” which is described below. Coke Spoon 02 is a version of the McSpoon made of gold-plated bronze, while Coke Spoon 01 is a ballpoint pen cap made of the same expensive material. You can see pics of these items at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art website. Wong unfortunately died in 2010, but they endeared themselves to me by calling their own body of work “postinteresting,” which is hilarious.
Predictably, McDonald's sent out a cease and desist letter with alacrity.
As Fox News reported at the time:
“The piece was part of the pair's 2005 ‘Indulgences' collection, inspired by the luxury goods market and designed to be the ultimate gift for the wealthy bachelor who had it all, said Courtney of Ju$t Another Rich Kid. ‘Indulgences' featured gold-plated Playboy swizzle sticks, 24-karat gold pills meant to be swallowed, golden dumbbells and another golden coke spoon cast from the cap of a BIC pen.” Wong was quoted as saying, “It's kind of the pop culture of today with a bling twist.” Philip Wood, the creative director of CITIZEN:Citizen, which had been showing the piece, said, “I think it's a shame because I don't think there's any intent in damning anybody's reputation. ... It really is a comment on how these objects change shape when they get into culture.”
For other people named Tony Martin, see Tony Martin (disambiguation)
Anthony Edward Martin (born 16 December 1944)[1] is a farmer from Norfolk, England, who shot a burglar dead in their home in August 1999. Martin was convicted of murder, later reduced to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility, and served three years in prison, having been denied parole. They have since lived at a secret address.
Burglary and shooting [ edit ]
On 20 August 1999, Tony Martin, a bachelor, was living alone at their farmhouse, Bleak House, in Emneth Hungate, Norfolk which they had inherited from their uncle in about 1980.[2] They claimed to have been burgled a total of ten times, losing £6,000 worth of furniture. Police sources say they are not sure that all the incidents took place.[3] Martin also complained about police inaction over the burglaries and claimed that multiple items and furniture were stolen such as dinnerware and a grandfather clock.[3] Martin had equipped themselves with an illegally held pump-action Winchester Model 1300 12 gauge[4] shotgun which they claimed to have found. Changes in legislation in 1988, resulting from the Hungerford massacre, had changed the licensing treatment of semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of more than two to equate to that of a firearm, requiring a valid firearms certificate.[5][6] Martin had their shotgun certificate revoked in 1994 after they found a man stealing apples in their orchard and shot a hole in the back of their vehicle.[7]
On the evening of 20 August 1999, two burglars – Brendon Fearon, 29, and 16-year-old Fred Barras, both Irish Travellers from Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire[8] – broke into Martin's house.[9] Shooting downwards in the dark with their shotgun loaded with birdshot, Martin shot three times towards the intruders (once when they were in the stairwell and twice more when they were trying to flee through the window of an adjacent ground floor room). Barras was hit in the back and both sustained gunshot injuries to their legs. Both escaped through the window but Barras died at the scene.[10] Martin claimed that they opened fire after being woken when the intruders smashed a window. The prosecution accused them of lying in wait for the burglars and opening fire without warning from close range, in retribution for previous break-ins at their home.[11]
On 10 January 2000, Fearon and Darren Bark, 33 (who had acted as the getaway driver), both from Newark-on-Trent, admitted to conspiring to burgle Martin's farmhouse. Fearon was sentenced to 36 months in prison, and Bark to 30 months[9] (with an additional 12 months arising from previous offences). Fearon was released on 10 August 2001.[9] Fred Barras, the dead youth, had already been convicted of a total of 29 offences by the time of their death at the age of 16, including seven convictions for theft and six for fraud.[12] They had been sentenced to two months in a young offenders' institution for assaulting a police officer, theft and being drunk and disorderly. On the night they were killed, Barras had just been released on bail after being accused of stealing garden furniture. Their elderly grandmother, Mary Dolan, stated: "It's not fair that the farmer has got all the money and they are the one that took Fred away."[13]
Murder trial [ edit ]
On 23 August 1999, Martin was charged with the murder of Barras, the attempted murder of Fearon, "wounding with intent to cause injury" to Fearon and "possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life".[9] Martin did not hold a valid shotgun certificate (licence), let alone the more restrictive Firearms Certificate they would have needed to possess the Winchester pump-action shotgun that held a maximum of five rounds.
English law permits a person to kill another in self-defence only if the person defending them or themselves uses no more than "reasonable force"; it is the responsibility of the jury to determine whether or not an unreasonable amount of force was used.[14] The jury at the trial were told that they had the option of returning a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder, if they thought that Martin "did not intend to kill or cause serious bodily harm".[15] However, the jurors found Martin guilty of murder by a 10 to 2 majority.[16]
They were sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommended minimum term to serve of 9 years, reduced to 8 years by the Lord Chief Justice.
Appeal [ edit ]
An appeal was considered in October 2001 by three senior judges headed by Lord Woolf LCJ. Submissions by the defence that Martin had fired in their own defence were rejected by the appeal court. On this occasion, the defence also submitted evidence that Martin was diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder exacerbated by depression[17] and that their paranoia was specifically directed at anyone intruding into their home; they were also diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.[18] This submission was accepted by the Court of Appeal and, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, Martin's murder conviction was replaced by manslaughter carrying a five-year sentence, and their ten-year sentence for wounding Fearon was reduced to three years. These sentences were to run concurrently.[19]
Parole applications and release [ edit ]
Martin was imprisoned in Highpoint Prison at Stradishall in Suffolk. When they became eligible for parole and early release in January 2003, the Parole Board rejected their application without stating a reason.[20] The chairperson of the parole board, Sir David Hatch, in an interview with The Times described Martin as "a very dangerous man" who might still believe their action had been right.[21]
Martin challenged the decision in the High Court, where the parole board's decision was upheld.[22] Probation officers on Martin's cases said there was an "unacceptable risk" that Martin might again react with excessive force if other would-be burglars intruded on their Norfolk farm.[23] On 28 July 2003, Martin was released after serving three years of their five-year sentence,[9] the maximum period for which they could be held following good behaviour.
Compensation claim [ edit ]
During 2003, Fearon applied for, and received, an estimated £5,000 of legal aid to sue Martin for loss of earnings due to the injuries they had sustained.[24] However, the case was thrown into doubt when photographs were published in The Sun, showing them "cycling and climbing with little apparent difficulty" suggesting that Fearon's injuries were not as serious as had been claimed.[25] While the case was pending, Fearon was recalled to jail after being charged with the theft of a vehicle while on probation on a conviction for dealing heroin.[26] Fearon later dropped the case when Martin agreed to drop a counter-claim. [27]
Nick Makin, Martin's solicitor, said: "It is appalling that the family of someone who has a criminal record for burglary and assault should attempt to claim any damages of criminal injury when they were shot while burgling the dwelling of an innocent person... It is also appalling that they may get legal aid while their victim is in prison and patently unable to work and equally cannot get legal aid... There is something wrong and perverse with our legal system that it permits this."[13]
Threats, interviews, and political activity [ edit ]
The BBC reported in 2003 that Fearon's supporters put a bounty on Martin's head of several tens of thousands of pounds.[10] In July 2003, The Daily Telegraph reported that a cousin of Barras had said that a £60,000 bounty had been put on Martin's head.[28]
In October 2003, the Daily Mirror paid Martin £125,000 for an exclusive interview on their release from prison. After investigation, the Press Complaints Commission ruled that the payment was justified and in the public interest because Martin "had a unique insight into an issue of great public concern".[29]
Since their release Martin has appeared on the platform of the UK Independence Party (UKIP)[30] and was the guest-of-honour at the Traditional Britain Group's Annual Dinner at Simpson's-in-the-Strand in London on 7 November 2003.[31] Martin said themselves that they had attended meetings of the National Front in Norfolk, and later went on to endorse the British National Party.[32] One of Martin's uncles by marriage, Andrew Fountaine, was a founding member of the National Front.[3][32]
Recent years [ edit ]
In August 2014, it was revealed that Martin's house had been boarded up since their imprisonment and they had subsequently lived both with friends and in their car.[33]
On 31 December 2015, the media reported that Martin had been arrested on suspicion of possessing an illegal firearm.[34] Martin was not charged.[35]

With the preseason finale out of the way, Washington Redskins and officials and coaches now must get to work. They'll spend the next two days reviewing both the video from the Tampa Bay matchup and each player's contributions from training camp until now, then grade them out and meet to reach an agreement on the final roster spots.
By 4 p.m. Saturday, the Redskins must cut 22 players to form the initial 53-man roster of the 2016 season. Note the word “initial”; a lot can change between now and the Sept. 12 season opener against Pittsburgh. After players pass through league-wide waivers, Washington could make additional signings and part with some of the players who did survive Saturday's cut.
It's believed that General Manager Scot McCloughan and director of pro personnel Alex Santos will seek additional help at outside linebacker once additional players become available. They should have a few to consider. About 682 players (aside from Washington's 22 cuts) will hit the streets between now and Saturday as each team gets down from 75 to 53 players. Some will re-sign to their original team's practice squads – if they have remaining eligibility – once they pass through waivers unclaimed.
Unlike in the past, when the Redskins had poor records the previous year and thus ranked high on the waiver-priority list, they now rank 21st and could see desired players awarded to other teams ahead of them.
But all that will sort itself out this weekend. Between now and then, team brass has some difficult decisions to make at a number of spots on the roster.
Here's a look at five of the toughest calls the team could have to make:
Washington quarterback Nate Sudfeld is no guarantee for a roster spot but a risky cut. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)
1. Third quarterback vs. a player who can help elsewhere: Washington likes rookie Nate Sudfeld, but all of the decision-makers agree that he's a year, maybe two, away from reliable backup status. The Redskins would like to keep Sudfeld and develop them for a larger role in the future. But does that mean keeping them on the 53-man roster, or the practice squad?
The practice squad would involve a big roll of the dice, as they would have to go unclaimed on waivers before the team could sign him. Sudfeld showed promise. Another team could snag him, possibly. A 53-man spot would avoid that risk. But can Washington really afford to carry a third quarterback — an automatic inactive on Sundays — and pass on carrying a player at another position who has a chance to contribute every week, whether on special teams or as a backup on offense or defense?
[Tough decisions show how much McCloughan has improved roster]
2. Veteran defensive linemen: Some within the organization prefer to carry six defensive linemen, while others lean toward seven. But settling on this group isn't easy. Chris Baker is a lock, and Ziggy Hood had the best preseason of any player on their unit. But Ricky Jean Francois, Kendall Reyes, Cullen Jenkins and Kedric Golston could face some uncertainty. Another veteran, Jerrell Powe, and rookies Matt Ioannidis and Anthony Lanier, and another youngster, Corey Crawford, definitely do. Neither Jean Francois nor Reyes managed to significantly distinguish himself. They should both make the cut, but who starts?

The recently signed Jenkins still seems to have some left in the tank entering their 13th year, but they have only two practices and one preseason game under their belt. Golston worked almost exclusively as the starting nose tackle, but Hood also saw a fair amount of action there with the first unit. You could make the argument that Hood is more versatile and effective at either nose or end, and that the team can't afford to use a spot on Golston for only eight to 12 snaps a game. Golston is a well-respected member of the locker room and organization, and their release would come as a bit of a surprise. But how much weight will sentimental value carry on a unit that desperately needs to improve?
Lanier has shown great promise, but they remain raw and probably isn't realistically ready for prime time. They and Ioannidis (who only had a few bright spots) could both benefit from a year on the practice squad.
3. Four running backs or three? Matt Jones and Chris Thompson are locks, but who joins them? It's hard to envision this team carrying more than three running backs, although the injury histories of both Jones and Thompson, and the promise displayed by both Rob Kelley and Mack Brown, makes it almost seem smart to carry four. That means trimming from another position. They're already going without a fullback most likely, and it also seems unlikely that the team will carry more than three tight ends (look for Jordan Reed, Vernon Davis and Niles Paul to make the cut).
So another unit would lose a member if this happened. Both Kelley and Brown have something to offer as running backs and special-teams contributors. But, realistically, could the team get one of them onto the practice squad and call them up later if someone got hurt? Or did that monster night as a 1-2 punch make both too valuable to risk losing to waivers?
4. Four safeties or five? Some within the organization would probably prefer to go with seven defensive linemen, nine linebackers, six cornerbacks and four safeties. Others lean towards six defensive linemen, nine linebackers, six corners and five safeties. Who wins this argument? Josh Norman, Bashaud Breeland, Greg Toler, Quinton Dunbar, Dashaun Phillips and Kendall Fuller are the six corners who seem set to make the roster. DeAngelo Hall and David Bruton Jr. are your starting safeties, but if they can stay healthy, Duke Ihenacho could wind up pushing Bruton for time. Will Blackmon seems too valuable and versatile to part with. Those four, then, seem like virtual locks.
But Deshazor Everett played like a man determined to force their way on to this roster. The second-year pro, who made the team as an undrafted rookie last season and has become one of its top special teams players, just might carry too much value to pass on. Hall, Bruton and Blackmon also all have only so much football left in them. Keeping a young player around to develop makes sense.
5. Eight offensive linemen or nine? This could come down to needs elsewhere and the level of comfort with the center depth chart. It seems as if only seven offensive linemen will dress for games — the five starters, a swing tackle and a backup guard/center. It's difficult to dress eight, with only 46 of the 53 players active on game days). That's why Spencer Long's development at center was so important.

But are the Redskins confident enough in Kory Lichtensteiger's durability and Long's readiness behind them to go without Austin Reiter and Josh LeRibeus? Reiter probably offers more promise than LeRibeus, who has played more games but remains inconsistent with their snaps. Reiter still has practice squad eligibility, however, and the team could look elsewhere for more center help. With that in mind, keeping eight offensive linemen — Trent Williams, Shawn Lauvao, Long and Lichtensteiger and Brandon Scherff and Morgan Moses, along with Ty Nsekhe and Arie Kouandjio, would be a logical choice.

Product received for free
I got this game for free as I had the original Kingdom (now Classic) and the devs were cool enough to give everyone who had classic this updated game for free. It's a massive improvement from classic, which I believe is based only on one land, whereas with New Lands (as the name says) there is a lot more to explore, and the game gets gradually harder as you explore each new land. I love that you can unlock secrets throughout the game which make the gameplay so much better, such as the statues and the hermits and the different mounts. It's very fun to play, but can be frustrating at times if you don't strategise and spend your coins wisely. Overall, I would definitely recommend this because I get stuck into it for several hours at a time running back and forth and collecting coins and building things. It's very addictive.Another thing I will say is the music and sound effects are very well done, very atmospheric. And I play this game with headphones, so when there's a creaking or a growling sound coming from the Greed, it literally makes me jump lol. Very cleverly done.
Game Censorship: Nintendo
Video games are still blamed for a lot of things now-a-days including people being violent, lazy or stupid. However, back in the 90's the video game violence debate reached a boiling point and many games were changed or edited to remove things that would be offensive or too violent. Nintendo, wanting to be more of a family gaming company took the lead while Sega was looked at as the more adult system.
Let's take a look of some examples of censorship or changes to popular games.
Mortal Kombat
Probably one of the most famous instances of Nintendo's censorship is in Mortal Kombat. Mortal Kombat was known for its violence and brutal fatalities so when it was set to be released to home systems many gamers were excited to experience this in their own home. However, Nintendo did not want to show graphic violence like blood or guts being pulled out so some significant changes were made to the game.
[youtube id=”iPZmGV2iodQ” width=”633″ height=”356″]
As seen in the video above the blood was replaced with sweat and the more graphic fatalities were replaced with more tame ones like Subzero freezing and then breaking your body instead of ripping your head off. This did not go over well with the public and MK was a failure for Nintendo, by the time MK2 was released full blood and fatalities were back.
Final Fight
Final Fight was a beat em up game released by Capcom. One of the enemies that you would have to fight in the game was named Poison. Poison was female and did flip and kicks and for the most part was easy to beat.
When the game was ported to the Super Nintendo, it was decided to change the women characters because hitting females was frowned upon. Strangely enough Akira Yasuda, a character and game designer stated that Poison and Roxy were transvestites not women. In the end, it did not matter and so for the SNES release the characters were changed to Billy and Sid, who were punk rockers that did pretty much the same thing as Poison and Roxy.
In addition to the sex change blood from stabbing or slashing an enemy was replaced by an explosion like effect.
Castlevania IV
Even the slightest hint of sexually or nudity was censored from games. In Castlevania IV nude statuses were modified in the U.S. release to cover them up. The same was done in Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse. In addition, in CV3 the Medusa monster was changed to have a more manly chest than female one.
Blood was also removed from the game. In the original Japanese release, the title screen bled onto the floor, but it was removed for the U.S. release. Within the game itself there were pits filled with red blood, but they were replaced with green ooze.
Bionic Commando
In Japan, Bionic Commando was called, Top Secret: The Resurrection of Hitler. The name pretty much told you the plot of the game, which stayed the same when it was released in the U.S. However, Nintendo did not want to feature any hate groups whatsoever and so the Swastikas on the Nazi flags were changed to Germanic eagles and the name Nazi was replaced with “The BADDs” and Hitler was renamed to Master D.
Nintendo's Change of Heart
There were many other changes made to a number of Nintendo games ported to the U.S. in the 90's. However, as more and more people looked elsewhere for gaming Nintendo decided money beats censorship and soon new games had all the blood, gore and sex that were legally allowed and the world rejoiced.

ST. PETERSBURG — The city's African-American deputy mayor, Kanika Tomalin, turned to Facebook over the weekend to call out a local clothing store for what they say was blatant racial profiling.
Tomalin said they were shopping at the Central Avenue boutique MISRED Outfitters on Saturday when a clerk asked them and their cousin to prove they were eligible for the store's "Healthcare Appreciation Day Discount." The clerk, Tomalin said, had not asked the white woman in line ahead of them to prove they were a health care worker.
Later that day, Tomalin blasted the store on their personal Facebook page:
"Was I really just blatantly racially profiled while shopping on the 600 block of our beloved 'Burg? Wow. #misreadinmisred."
Store owner Sara Stonecipher wasn't there when the incident took place, but after talking to their clerk, she's convinced that no one was racially profiled. They said they wished that Tomalin, a frequent customer whom Stonecipher said they have a good relationship with, had talked to them first before taking the dispute to social media. MISRED's Facebook page has been bombarded with critical comments.
There's a political tinge to this dispute: Stonecipher and their husband, Nathan, are supporters of former Mayor Rick Baker, who is locked in a bitter election fight with Tomalin's boss, incumbent Mayor Rick Kriseman.
Tomalin has since removed their Facebook post but has not said why. They wrote in the post that they aren't encouraging any kind of retributive action against the store.
Tomalin told the Tampa Bay Times that they have no regrets about posting it. They remain convinced that they and their cousin, who are both African-American, were treated differently from a white customer. They were shocked that Stonecipher was upset that they had not personally contacted them
"Why is it my obligation to protect her?" Tomalin said.
• • •
For "Health Care Appreciation Day," MISRED Outfitters offered a $5 gift card for every purchase of $25 or more. "Just Show Your Badge!" the ad said. It was displayed 12 times inside the store, Stonecipher said, as well as on social media.
Tomalin said the white customer ahead of them at the register was asked by the clerk if they were a health care professional. That customer was given the deal, Tomalin said, without having to show proof that they worked in health care.
Tomalin said that when their cousin was at the register, they asked for the same discount. Tomalin said their cousin works for the BlueCross BlueShield insurance company. Then Tomalin said the clerk asked their cousin for proof.
When they pointed out the difference in the way they were treated compared to the white customer, Tomalin said, the clerk was "flippant and dismissive."
Stonecipher offered a different version of events from the store clerk, who they said was an 18-year-old Latina. The clerk said the customer did show their identification to prove they were a nurse. But the clerk said they overheard Tomalin and the cousin in line say they didn't qualify, so they didn't offer them the discount.
The owner said they weren't eligible for the deal anyway: They spent $21.60.
"That's really the crux of it," Stonecipher said. "We've always treated everyone professionally and respectfully. Honestly, it's mind-blowing to me."
Tomalin said the dispute wasn't about the deal. They were upset that they were treated very differently, that a white customer was not asked to produce identification and they were.
"The discount was never a variable in our discussions," Tomalin said, "and it's disingenuous to suggest that."
• • •
The Stoneciphers are themselves prominent residents. Nathan Stonecipher is a co-owner of Green Bench Brewing Co. and chairperson of the board of trustees at St. Petersburg College. They're listed as hosts for Baker's fundraiser in the Warehouse Arts District on Friday.
Sara Stonecipher said they hoped politics played no role in the dispute.
"I really hope that would not be the case," they said. "I'm very scared right now. I'm a small-business owner."
Given Tomalin's high profile, the store owner said it was unfair of the deputy mayor to subject their shop to online criticism before reaching out to them
"Kanika has a lot of followers and is very influential because they are the deputy mayor," Stonecipher said. "I'm trying to be what St. Pete is all about. There was no need for this to happen."
Last week, Kriseman urged residents to buy from locally owned small businesses that had been hurt by Hurricane Irma. Stonecipher fears Tomalin's Facebook post will hurt business even more.
Tomalin said any suggestion that their Facebook post was politically motivated was "ridiculous."
"If it was political, I would not have been shopping in that store in the first place," Tomalin said. "It was not politically motivated. I would not ever, under any circumstances, subject anyone in the city to that for political advancement."
Tomalin left a voicemail for Sara Stonecipher, who responded with an email. But as of Wednesday, they had not spoken to each other. The incident has left bruised feelings all around.
"She has a lot of people who look up to her," Stonecipher said. "At the end of the day, nobody racially profiled them. She's got the upper hand in this. I'm just a small-business owner. I don't understand why they did this."
Tomalin said they feel no obligation to stay quiet when they were the one who was racially profiled.
"To be treated in a discriminatory manner while being serviced," Tomalin said. "That is what I experienced."

It's time to take a break from the usual post and do something different. I've had quite a few requests to do a post on love and dating for the INFJ, and so here it is. If you have any requests for a type you'd like to see addressed, please leave them in the comment section below.
Dating for the INFJ can be especially challenging. Not because they are tough to get along with. It's actually quite the opposite. INFJs have arguably the greatest capacity of all the types for depth, love, soulfulness, empathy, and have a strong desire to share their rich inner lives with their significant other.
But it's these aspects of their personality that cause the Idealist so much grief in their search for a mate. For the INFJ, they almost never date casually or play the field. They have to feel a bond that takes time to cultivate. But once that bond is established, the INFJ will freely give themselves, heart and mind, to their significant other. The problem is, most other types, especially the SJs and the SPs, do not possess the INFJs need for soul sharing, and while they might try to listen dutifully to the INFJs flights of imagination, they tend to not fully understand what the INFJ means by soulful bonding, often leaving the INFJ disappointed and reaching. Thus, the INFJ tends to only find their mate through a series of trial and error, and they may have to date multiple people, going through a cycle of painful breakups before they find “the one.” For the INFJ, such breakups can leave their sensitive and complex personality deeply wounded, and at times they vow not to date anyone for an extended period of time until they are fully healed.
Now it's important to note that that while the INFJ, like any type, has its struggles when dating, they are one of the few types that can get along all the other types, for they tend to give themselves to the study of the person of interest in detail, figuring out their likes and dislikes, sacrificing their own needs for their sake. Thus, other types tend to be naturally attracted to them—their air of mystery and kind heartedness—and thus, even though they might decide to give up on love, they often find themselves being pursued, and true to their romantic nature, they open back up as time wears on. And once the INFJ finds someone of any type that appreciates them for who they are, the bond experienced between the two is truly a special thing. Their significant other will find unconditional love, a gifted listener, and a support system that few other types can give.
As far as actual dates are concerned, INFJs enjoy physical activities and social gatherings to a degree, but when it comes to romance, they much prefer sitting one-on-one with their interest in a quiet place where the two of them can share their thoughts and ideas. They enjoy seeing movies, going to art museums, poetry, plays, novels, and the like, but unlike some who merely wish to be entertained, the INFJ wants to discuss and explore what it meant to them personally.
In regards to sex, the INFJ often feels divided. On one hand, they insist that sex must be an expression of love rather than lust, and will almost never engage in it casually. They wish for sex to be a communion of the souls, a life-long bond between them and their mate. To them, even the word sex might seem crude, and love elevates the relationship to a higher plain. But make no mistake, the INFJ highly responsive to physical beauty and sexual attraction, and for all their other-worldliness, they make passionate and warm mates.
Oddly, some INFJs can be given to spells of hot and cold when it comes to love making. They tend to not enjoy public displays of affection, and wish to be in the mood, and to choose when the expressions of love take place. One minute they may be warm and inviting, while the next standoffish, which can be quite confusing to their mates. Still, despite their seeming fluctuations, the INFJ is a very physically affectionate mate.

I like to think myself a connoisseur of science fiction film, or at the very least, a fan. I've seen the birth of the genre with George Méliès and Fritz Lang, enjoyed the black-and-white space tales that so often become MST3k fodder, and reveled in the several Philip K. Dick retellings. But I've never seen anything like Under the Skin, and I'm pretty sure that's why I like it.
Based on a book by Michel Faber, Under the Skin is about sex and consuming men—like actually eating them. Now, is that the craziest thing to ever happen in an Alien horror film? Hardly. But with Scarlett Johannson's powerful performance in the starring role along with the whole film feeling like its an art house piece, and you get one truly unique piece of sci-fi filmmaking.
Where alien sci-fi à la Ridley Scott is much more action-packed, director Jonathan Glazer's Under the Skin is much more of a slow burn with a majority of the movie's 108 minutes spent with Johansson prowling Glasgow for unsuspecting men, seducing them, and then, you know, eating them. Glazer has even said that some men they picked up while filming didn't even know they were in a movie at all. The movie does hit a few dull moments but patience pays off with a truly bizarre ending that I still don't know what to make of.

Political reporters are less vexed by the reasoning behind Donald Trump's decision to mount a narcissistic campaign of self-aggrandizement disguised as a presidential bid than they are by the fact that it resonates with so many Republican primary voters. More than a few pieces have been penned amid the effort to understand the Trump surge and the primary voters that make up their base of support. The Washington Post's Dave Weigel submitted one of the best dispatches on the subject after spending several days covering the Trump campaign on the ground. They discovered that Trump has staying power, and not merely because of what they represent but because of who they are and how they are running for the highest office in the land. But all those traits that make them attractive to GOP primary voters are present in another candidate: Carly Fiorina.
Weigel's excellent report should be read by all who cover political campaigns, and particularly those in the pundit class who – myself included – believed all the laws of political physics should apply to Trump and have been shocked to learn that they do not. Despite all the historic forces arrayed against their steady rise in the polls, perhaps because of them, Trump remains buoyed by the support of nearly a quarter of the GOP electorate. Weigel points to a variety of elements of the conventional wisdom that have failed commentators. Trump's rude antagonism toward Republicans is a net plus among their supporters. Voters see their tactlessness as honesty. Their wealth leads voters to believe they are beholden to no donor. The fun they are having on the trail is infectious. Finally and most consequentially, they have assembled the rudimentary staffing scaffolds that could become the foundation of a real campaign team.
On paper, these qualities are equally attributable to the former Hewlett-Packard CEO running for the Republican nomination. Fiorina is quite wealthy; with an estimated net worth of $60 million, they don't have Trump's $2.9 billion on hand (a far cry from the $10 billion their campaign alleged the real estate magnate to possess), but they are certainly in no one's pocket. Fiorina is blunt and antagonistic toward those who deserve their scorn, although they reserve their barbs primarily for Democrats – a substantial stylistic distinction from Trump, who attacks Republicans almost exclusively. She's an outsider and a patrician who is not a member of the political class – a fortunate outcome of losing their 2010 U.S. Senate bid against California's Barbara Boxer.
“Regularly, they say things that don't normally come out of politicians' mouths,” National Review's Jay Nordlinger discerned while profiling the former CEO. “For instance, they describe wind power as the pet of ‘ideologues in the environmental movement.' Those turbines are ‘slicing up hundreds of thousands of birds every year.' True, but who says it, among politicians?”
One intangible aspect of Trump's allure that Weigel doesn't touch on is the likelihood that the celebrity's supporters are so drawn to him, at least in part, because the rest of the political universe is repulsed by him. This is one stylistic element of Trump's approach to running for the White House that Fiorina will not be able to duplicate. Perhaps no Republican running for the 2016 nomination outside Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker so excites both “establishment” Republicans and the outside-the-Beltway activist class as does Fiorina.
“Every stop never gets off message,” observed radio host Rush Limbaugh last week. “She handles the media with aplomb and skill and it's obvious they enjoy doing it, and she's schooling people. She's showing how it's done.”
“[S]he is someone who Republicans need to have in the race because they are a woman and they are a successful woman,” GOP campaign strategist Ford O'Connell told Politico last January. From conservative talkers to the consulting class and many in between, Fiorina has struck a chord.
And, yet, they poll especially poorly among Republican primary voters. In a CNN/ORC survey of the national GOP primary electorate released on Tuesday, Fiorina secured just 1 percent of the vote with 4 percent of GOP voters dubbing them their second choice candidate. That lackluster performance may change, however, when Republican voters get a chance to assess Fiorina vis-à-vis their Republican opponents on the debate stage.
The Republicans in attendance rose to their feet at the conclusion of Fiorina's foreign policy address at the Reagan Library on Monday night. In the address, they identified the threats facing the United States – from a nuclearizing Iran to Chinese revanchism – and they laid out a compelling case for a robust American defense of its interests abroad and those of its allies.
Taking questions from the audience at the conclusion of their speech, Fiorina was asked by an honest and frustrated Republican voter how they would, as president, force Republican congressional leaders to heed the will of the GOP's base voters. “I believe ours was intended to be a citizen government; of, by, and for the people,” Fiorina replied. “I don't know when we got used to this idea that only a professional political class can hold public office. It used to be, for most of our nation's history, that leaders would step forward out of private life, and serve for a time, and return to private life.”
Rather than, as Trump has suggested, wrestled a co-equal branch of government into submission through sheer force of personality and, if necessary, imperial overreach similar to that practiced by Barack Obama, Fiorina went on to define how their administration would mobilize public pressure by, for example, using mobile technology to bombard elected leaders with text message and telephone calls. Those Trump supporters who have not entirely succumbed to fatalistic nihilism and continue to see aspects of the republic worth preserving will see this as a feasible and preferable alternative to governing through bombast.
“Margaret Thatcher, a woman I admire greatly, once said that they were not content to manage the decline of a great nation,” Fiorina said near the close of their address. “Neither am I. I am prepared to lead the resurgence of a great nation.” It was Trump's “make America great again,” but with a touch more – well, the reality television star might call it “class.”
Don't expect Trump's supporters to bolt into Fiorina's camp anytime soon. Stylistically, they are more a contrast to Trump than a compliment. Their supporters want to make a statement and issue a vote of no confidence in the Republican Party. Fiorina will not satisfy that desire. On paper, however, they could serve as a capable and viable Trump alternative.
Post Office workers are set to strike over five days
Post Office workers are to stage five days of strikes in the week leading up to Christmas.
The industrial action next week follows a dispute with management over job losses, the closure of a final salary pension scheme and branches being shut.
The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said the walkout would include Christmas Eve.
A spokesperson defended the decision to strike, saying the union feared the Post Office "as we know it" will cease to exist unless "we stand up now".
A spokesperson from Royal Mail said: "If any industrial action takes place, we expect there to be no or little effect on the services we provide to our customers.
"Post Office limited has around 11,000 branches which will continue to operate as normal.
"Customers who need to post at a Post Office should use these branches."
The spokesperson added: "Royal Mail customers will also continue to have access to pre-paid parcel drop-off through over 1,200 Customer Service Points at Delivery Offices nationwide."
The Post Office also said it had dramatically cut its losses over the last four years and modernised almost 7,000 branches, with more than 200,000 extra opening hours each week.
Image: The Post Office said it was 'extremely disappointed' by the CWU announcement
Kevin Gilliland, the Post Office's network and sales director, said: "Just today, we agreed with the CWU that we would resume talks, which have been ongoing throughout the summer, on Wednesday.
"We are extremely disappointed that they prefer to resort to calls for strike action and we will be reviewing our position in light of this development.
"Our focus must be on supporting our customers, who rely on us at Christmas more than ever."
CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: "Our members are being forced into fighting to save their jobs and this great institution from terminal decline.
"We didn't want to be in this position ... We are defending the very future of the Post Office in this country.
"We want a Post Office that works for everyone, for communities, for small and medium-sized businesses, and for the people who serve them - our hard-working members.
"But the people running the Post Office have no serious plan other than further closures and managed decline and we won't accept that."
They added: "We will be making a firm proposal for meaningful talks to establish a vision for the future and, if the company respond to that positively, then this dispute can be avoided."

Jury selection in the long-awaited trial of billionaire hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam on charges of insider trading has begun in New York.
Judge Richard Holwell has told jurors that Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein is on a list of witnesses who may be called to testify.
Mr Rajaratnam, who was arrested in October 2009, has pleaded not guilty to the charges laid against him.
Some 150 potential jurors were questioned by Judge Holwell.
Mr Rajaratnam was met by photographers and camera crews as they arrived at the New York court for jury selection.
They have been free on bail of $100m. If found guilty, they could face more than 20 years in jail.
Judge Holwell said they expected opening statements to take place on Wednesday.

Analysis They will be paying close attention to the outcome of the trial in financial circles. Information is the lifeblood of traders. But there's a fine line between acting on rumours and tips, and acting on information that's private. The government hopes this will help redefine that line, which is why this case could change how business is done on Wall Street. The man at the centre of the trial
The New York federal prosecutor has described the case as the "largest hedge fund insider trading case in history".
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in its complaint filed earlier this year that the case involved "widespread and repeated insider trading" at a number of hedge funds, including Galleon.
According to the SEC, the alleged unlawful trading involved the use of inside information on companies including Google, Hilton Hotels and Intel.
Incidents cited in court documents describe the passing of information on takeovers or company results before they were publicly released.
Mr Rajaratnam then traded on that information, often on behalf of Galleon, the SEC alleges.
Mr Rajaratnam founded the Galleon Group hedge fund, which managed about $7bn at the time of their arrest.
Their personal wealth has been estimated at about $1.3bn.
More than a dozen people, including employees of some of America's biggest companies, including IBM and Intel, have been criminally or civilly charged in the complex case.
So far 19 have pleaded guilty.
A fixture on the Daily Show during election season has become Jon Stewart watching CNN for the latest news, apparently only to make fun of whatever new gizmos, gadgets, and exasperated Anderson Cooper expressions may prevail. Last night, it was CNN's “Virtual Convention,” a sort of simulation of little people holding up signs for their candidates.
RELATED: Virtual Inanity: CNN's Latest Election Night Gimmick Is The ‘Virtual Convention'
Stewart opened their segment with the hope that Super Tuesday would be the night to end all nights, as this race has been something of a challenge. “The Republican nominee for President is being elected by erosion,” Stewart joked, noting that the media had, at this point, “run out of metaphors” (Howard Dean was the example of this by comparing the election to an omelet). If Ohio was the decisive state, watching Romney win the state would mean it was all smooth sailing to the general election for him, but long after bringing out the pipe and brandy, Stewart was hit with the harsh reality that “this enormous balloon inflated before our eyes turns into a whoopie cushion,” that the media narrative is that this race is far from over.
They then turned to CNN, where Anderson Cooper seemed, to Stewart, to be making a break for it while Wolf Blitzer‘s levels of enthusiasm were so high Stewart wondered if “they keep them in the dark about things so that their on-screen emotions seem like they're really happening.” But before they spent too much time mocking Blitzer, they found the “virtual convention,” where little holographic people held up colored signs for their candidates to simulate the Republican convention. “Mitt Romney is very popular with these artificially rendered computer people, I think we found this base!” Stewart joked, as the Super Tuesday votes made them the most regaled among the computer folks. The convention was not all peaceful, however, when Stewart's World of Warcraft characters came crashing through the convention.

CALGARY, AB -- For a second straight year, Calgary Flames prospects Laurent Brossoit (Edmonton) and Tyler Wotherspoon (Portland) will face off against each other for the Ed Chynoweth Cup in the WHL Championship series.
Brossoit and the Edmonton Oil Kings shut the door on the Calgary Hitmen on Tuesday, picking up a 2-0 win in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Championship series. Brossoit, the Flames sixth round pick in the 2011 NHL Draft, stopped 26 shots to earn their fifth shutout in the postseason and is now sitting second on the WHL single-season playoff shutout list. Only former Vancouver Giant Dustin Slade has more playoff goose-eggs (six) in a single campaign.
The Surrey, BC native also owns the best postseason GAA (1.58) and is tied with Red Deer's Patrik Bartosak for second in playoff save percentage (.941).
Edmonton dispatched Kootenay, Medicine Hat and Calgary to reach the Championship series, losing just four times in their playoff run. Brossoit has stopped 399 of the 424 shots he's faced thus far.
Wotherspoon and the Portland Winterhawks whizzed through the opening three rounds of the WHL playoffs, taking down Everett, Spokane and Kelowna in 15 games. Just like the Oil Kings, the Winterhawks have been very stingy in the goals-allowed department, limiting their opposition to just 24 tallies. While netminder Mac Carruth has put forth their A-game, Wotherspoon and the rest of Portland's defensive corps deserve a lot of credit for the team's ability to neutralize opponents.
Wotherspoon, playing alongside WHL Rookie of the Year Seth Jones in Portland's top pairing, logs a ton of minutes on a nightly basis and is counted on to shut down the opposition's best players. The coaching staff throws the duo out in any situation and they have proven to be dependable game-in, game-out.
The 20 year-old has also been able to provide their club with offence, recording two goals and eight points in playoffs. They set new career-highs in assists (30) and points (37) in the 2012-13 regular season and their seven goals matched a career-best set in the 2012-13 campaign.
Both Brossoit and Wotherspoon, who grew up together and are close friends, inked entry-level deals with the Flames this spring.
Game 1 goes Friday in Portland at 8:00 PM MT.

You probably haven't seen too many of these. The Corey Cruiser (C.C.) was a factory authorized camper conversion that filled the space between a motorhome and towable trailer. The ad for this specific project indicates it is a 1969 Dodge A108 C. C. The current listing is found here on Craigslist with an asking price of $12,900, located in Tequesta (Palm Beach), Florida. A van very similar to this one sold on eBay in 2013 for just over $5,100 and this exact van was for sale earlier this year in California. Have these vans increased 150% in value in four years? I doubt it. Especially with the work that this one needs to make it a cool cruiser again.
The interior “camper” features of this van are completely gone. In its place, you have some nice artificial turf. While this does limit the nostalgic factor of an original camper, it is a blank slate for the new owner to finish it how they like. According to The Murphy Auto Museum, these vans included the following as standard equipment: V8 engine with an automatic transmission, air conditioning, sleeping for up to 4, refrigerator, gas range with oven, hot water heater, furnace, sink and wall-to-wall carpeting. The ad claims this van was owned by a “skateboard pioneer” so maybe they stripped it to have more room for hauling half-pipes?
The front of the passenger compartment seems pretty typical of a driven vehicle that is nearly fifty years old. It doesn't appear to have been abused or modified. It looks like it could be a driver as-is. Dig the sheepskin seat covers, original gauges and steering wheel.
There has been buzz around the van world in the past few years. Specifically, Volkswagen vans have set auction records including a 1963 23-window that sold at Barrett-Jackson in 2011 for over $200,000. These 1969 Dodge features 25 windows! While it may not be a six-figure project, this van will be a fun one when it's done. How would you finish it? Restoration, surf cruiser, modified camper, or?

“Let a man begin in prayer where they are, and that means anywhere, with any problem, with any desire. If what they ask for has them in its grip, that means that God can meet them there. If they have a ruling passion to be liked by others, to be selected to an important post, to be able to hold their marriage together, to recover the confidence of a son or daughter, why should this not come squarely into their prayer? We can begin anywhere in petitionary prayer.” (Steere, Douglas V. Dimensions of Prayer. New York: Women's Division of Christian Service, 1962, p. 67.)
“How do I start praying?,” the question comes. I start praying exactly where I am. But I may have to begin by admitting that I'm not quite sure where I'm at. I may feel I'm standing in…
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico and the United States cannot pursue diverging policies on marijuana legalization, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was quoted as saying on Sunday, hinting they may be open to following the lead taken by some U.S. states in changing drug laws.

Political pressure has grown in Mexico to take a more liberal stance on marijuana since Washington and Colorado decided to legalize possession and sale of the drug for recreational use in 2012. Other U.S. states plan votes soon.
Marijuana, along with contraband like cocaine and crystal meth, has been a major source of income for violent drug cartels responsible for thousands of deaths in Mexico in recent years.
Proponents of reform say legalizing marijuana would both reduce the gangs' economic power and help generate more tax revenue.
Pena Nieto says they are in favor of debating the issue despite personal misgivings about legalizing cannabis, and lawmakers say Mexico cannot be out of step for ever with the United States, the principal buyer of illicit drugs that cross the border.
In an interview with Spanish newspaper El Pais, Pena Nieto said legalization of marijuana was a “growing phenomenon” and that the policies followed in the last 30 to 40 years had only led to more consumption and more production of drugs.
“Therefore it's a failed policy,” they told the newspaper.
“It needs to be reviewed. I repeat, I'm not in favor of legalization, this is a personal conviction. But we can't continue on this road of inconsistency between the legalization we've had in some places, particularly in the most important consumer market, the United States, and in Mexico where we continue to criminalize production of marijuana,” they added.
Their comments offered encouragement to supporters of change in Mexico, where polls have for years shown a majority of the population opposes outright legalization of marijuana.
Still, an April survey published by the public opinion unit of the lower house of Congress showed 73 percent of Mexicans backed legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes.
In February, Mexico's leftist opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) presented an initiative to legalize medical use of marijuana and Fernando Belaunzaran, a PRD member of congress pushing the plan, welcomed Pena Nieto's remarks.
Belaunzaran told Reuters the trend of liberalizing marijuana laws in the United States looked irreversible, and said they expected California to back legalizing the drug in 2016.
“Once California has permitted recreational marijuana, maintaining the ban in Mexico won't be sustainable,” they said.
In 2009, Mexico made it legal to carry up to 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of marijuana, 500 milligrams (0.018 ounces) of cocaine and tiny amounts of heroin and methamphetamines. However, advocates of reform say more must be done to cut crime.

President Obama is sending an “expeditionary force” of U.S. military special operators to carry out raids against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, a move that expands on their decision to send about 50 special operators to Syria to coordinate air strikes.
“In full coordination with the Government of Iraq, we're deploying a specialized expeditionary targeting force to assist Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces and put even more pressure on [ISIS],” Defense Secretary Ash Carter told the House Armed Services Committee in announcing the new deployment on Tuesday.

Although the term “expeditionary force” evokes large-scale mobilizations such as those seen in World War II or the Iraq War, Carter outlined a more limited deployment. But their announcement still provoked questions about the legal basis for the move, and caused one Democrat to warn of the specter of nuclear war with Russia.
In arguing for the additional force, Carter invoked the recent rescue of ISIS prisoners in Iraq and the raid in Syria that killed a top commander in charge of the terrorist group's oil and gas operations. “Imagine . . . on a standing basis, being able when occasions arise . . . to conduct raids like that anywhere in the territory of Syria and Iraq. That is what we're talking about.”

They couldn't, however, claim the legal authority to make such a deployment under the terms of the 2001 legislation that authorized the use of military force (AUMF) in Afghanistan and Iraq — the only such congressional authorization on the books. “I can't speak to [that],” Carter told Representative Bradley Byrne (R., Ala.).
#share#White House press secretary Josh Earnest urged lawmakers to pass new legislation providing Obama with the explicit authority to counter ISIS. “This effort is serious, and should be the focus of serious debate,” Earnest told reporters during their Tuesday briefing. “It will take more than three weeks to pass an AUMF, but Congress, in each of these cases, must stop using the fact that these issues are difficult as an excuse for doing nothing.”
RELATED: Obama's Strategic Bumbling Is Theater of the Absurd
Carter got a hint of just how difficult it may be to sell Congress on such legislation when Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) suggested that Obama's decision to place American fighter jets equipped “to target Russian planes” on the border between Turkey and Syria, and their stated opposition to Russian-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, could lead the U.S. into a nuclear war with Vladimir Putin's regime.
#related#“Russia's installation of their anti-aircraft missile-defense system increases that possibility of — whether it's intentional or even an accidental event — where one side may shoot down the other side's plane,” Gabbard told Carter. “And that's really where the potential is for this devastating nuclear war.”

Carter characterized the U.S. disagreement with Russia as a diplomatic problem, not a military danger. “We have a different view, a very different view from Russia about what would be constructive for them to do in Syria,” they said. “That's not the same as the United States and Russia clashing.”

While there are plenty of canned functions to design Butterworth IIR filters [1], it's instructive and not that complicated to design them from scratch. You can do it in 12 lines of Matlab code. In this article, we'll create a Matlab function butter_synth.m to design lowpass Butterworth filters of any order. Here is an example function call for a 5th order filter:
This article is available in PDF format for easy printing.
N= 5 % Filter order fc= 10; % Hz cutoff freq fs= 100; % Hz sample freq [b,a]= butter_synth(N,fc,fs) b = 0.0013 0.0064 0.0128 0.0128 0.0064 0.0013 a = 1.0000 -2.9754 3.8060 -2.5453 0.8811 -0.1254
Then, to find the frequency response:
[h,f]= freqz(b,a,256,fs); H= 20*log10(abs(h));
The magnitude response of the 5th order filter is shown in Figure 1, along with the response of the analog prototype.
Figure 1. Magnitude response of N= 5 IIR Butterworth filter with f c = 10 Hz and f s = 100 Hz. The prototype analog filter's response is also shown.
Notation
First, a word about notation. We need to distinguish frequency variables in the continuous-time (analog) world from those in the discrete-time world. In this article, the following notation for frequency will be used:
continuous frequency F Hz
continuous radian frequency Ω radians/s
complex frequency s = σ + jΩ
discrete frequency f Hz
discrete normalized radian frequency ω = 2πf/f s radians, where f s = sample freq
Background
Analog Butterworth filters have all-pole transfer functions. For example, a third-order Butterworth filter with Ω c = 1 rad/s has the transfer function:
$$H(s)=\frac{1}{s^3+2s^2+2s+1}$$
or
$$H(s)=\frac{1}{(s-p_{a0})(s-p_{a1})(s-p_{a2}) }\qquad(1)$$
where the subscript a denotes analog (s-plane) poles. The poles in the s-plane are:
p a0 = -.5 + j.866
p a1 = -1
p a2 = -.5 -j.866
We will transform the poles in the s-plane to poles in the z-plane using the bilinear transform [2,3]. The bilinear transform converts H(s) to H(z) by replacing s with:
$$s=2f_s\frac{1-z^{-1}}{1+z^{-1}}\qquad(2)$$
where f s is sample frequency. If we solve for z, we get:
$$z=\frac{1+s/(2f_s)}{1-s/(2f_s)}\qquad(3)$$
Equation 3 maps a point on the s plane to a point on the z plane. For example, if f s = 2 Hz, the s-plane real pole at -1 maps to:
$$p=\frac{1-1/4}{1+1/4}=0.6$$
For the 3rd order filter, with Ω c = 1 and f s = 2, the z-plane poles fall as shown in Figure 2.
From equation 1, H(s) has 3 zeros at s= ∞. How do they map to the z plane? We will show later that the bilinear transform maps -∞ to ∞ on the jΩ axis to -f s /2 to f s /2 on the unit circle. So the 3 zeros of H(s) map to +/- f s /2 on the unit circle, which corresponds to z= -1. (Recall that on the unit circle, z= ejω, where ω = 2πf/f s . For f = +/-f s /2, we have ω = +/-π, so z = ejπ = -1). The three zeros are represented by the ‘o' in figure 2.
We can now write the 3rd-order Butterworth H(z) as:
$$H(z)=K\frac{(z+1)(z+1)(z+1)}{(z-p_0)(z-p_1)(z-p_2)}\qquad(4)$$
where, from equation 3, p= [0.7143 +j 0.33 0.6 0.7143 -j 0.33]. Expanding the numerator and denominator, we have:
$$H(z)=K\frac{b_0z^3+b_1z^2+b_2z+b_3}{z^3+a_1z^2+a_2z+a_3}$$
$$H(z)=K\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+b_2z^{-2}+b_3z^{-3}}{1+a_1z^{-1}+a_2z^{-2}+a_3z^{-3}}\qquad(5)$$
Where b = [1 3 3 1] and a= [1 -2.0286 1.4762 -0.3714]. K is chosen to make gain = 1 at ω= 0: K = 1/H(ω=0) = 1/H(z=1) = sum(a)/sum(b)= .00952
Looking again at Figure 1, you may have wondered why the attenuation of the IIR filter is greater than that of the analog filter as f approaches f s /2. The reason is that the analog filter's zeros are at ∞, while the bilinear transform compresses the frequency scale so that the IIR filter's zeros are at f s /2.

Here is a summary of the steps for finding the filter coefficients :
Find the poles of the analog prototype filter with Ω c = 1 rad/s. Given the desired f c of the digital filter, find the corresponding analog frequency F c . Scale the s-plane poles by 2πF c . Transform the poles from the s-plane to the z-plane. Add N zeros at z = -1. Convert poles and zeros to polynomials with coefficients a n and b n .
Now let's look at the steps in detail. Note we'll repeat a lot of the math we already presented above. A Matlab function butter_synth that performs the filter synthesis is provided in the Appendix. It gives the same results as the built-in Matlab function butter(n,Wn) [1].
1. Poles of the analog filter. For a Butterworth filter of order N with Ω c = 1 rad/s, the poles are given by [4,5]:
$$p_{ak}= -sin(\theta)+jcos(\theta)$$
where $$\theta=\frac{(2k-1)\pi}{2N},\quad k=1:N$$
2. Given the desired f c , find analog frequency F c . As we'll show in the next section, the bilinear transform does not map the analog frequency F to discrete frequency f linearly. To achieve a digital filter cut-off frequency of f c , the analog prototype cut-off frequency must be:
$$F_c=\frac{f_s}{\pi}tan\left(\frac{\pi f_c}{f_s}\right)$$
This exercise is called frequency pre-warping. For example, if f s = 100 Hz and we want f c = 20 Hz, then F c = 23.13 Hz.
3. Scale the s-plane poles by 2πF c . The poles obtained in step 1 gave Ω c = 1 rad/s (i.e. 1/(2π) Hz). Multiplying the poles by 2πF c scales the analog filter cut-off frequency to F c and the digital filter cut-off frequency to f c .
4. Transform the poles from the s-plane to the z-plane using the bilinear transform. From equation 3,
$$p_k=\frac{1+p_{ak}/(2f_s)}{1-p_{ak}/(2f_s)},\quad k=1:N$$
5. Add N zeros at z = -1. Following the example of equation 4, the numerator of H(z) is (z + 1)N , meaning there are N poles at z = -1. We now can write H(z) as:
$$H(z)=K\frac{(z+1)^N}{(z-p_0)(z-p_1)...(z-p_{N-1})}\qquad(6)$$
In butter_synth, we represent the N zeros as a vector q= -ones(1,N).
6. Convert poles and zeros to polynomials with coefficients a n and b n . If we expand the numerator and denominator of equation 6, we get polynomials in z-n:
$$H(z)=K\frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+...+b_Nz^{-N}}{1+a_1z^{-1}+...+a_Nz^{-N}}\qquad(7)$$
The Matlab code to perform the expansion is:
a= poly(p) a= real(a) b= poly(q)
We want H(z) to have a gain of 1 at ω= 0. Letting z= ejω, we have z= 1. Then, referring to equation 7, we have gain at ω= 0 of:
$$H(z=1)=K\frac{\sum b}{\sum a}$$
So, for gain of 1 at ω= 0, we make $K=\sum a/\sum b$.
And that's the last step. Figure 3 shows the frequency response vs. order N for filters synthesized by butter_synth. Figure 4 shows the impulse response vs. order N for three cases.

x= [1 zeros(1,95)]; % impulse y= filter(b,a,x); % impulse response
Frequency Mapping of the Bilinear Transform
The bilinear transform does not map the continuous frequency F to discrete frequency f linearly. To show this, we evaluate equation 2 for s= jΩ and z= ejω:
$$j\Omega=2f_s\frac{1-e^{-j\omega}}{1+e^{-j\omega}}$$
$$j\Omega=j2f_stan(\omega/2)$$
Now substitute Ω= 2πF and ω= 2πf/f s :
$$F=\frac{f_s}{\pi}tan\left(\frac{\pi f}{f_s}\right)\qquad(8)$$
Figure 5 plots equation 8 for fs= 100 Hz. The entire analog frequency range maps to –f s /2 to f s /2. Also shown on the zoomed plot on the right is the transformation of discrete frequency f = 20 Hz to continuous frequency F = 23.13 Hz. Note that the frequency mapping is approximately linear for f < f s /10 or so.
Figure 6 shows the effect of using equation 8 to pre-warp the cut-off frequency of an analog prototype filter to give f c = 20 Hz. With pre-warping, the analog prototype poles were scaled by 2π*23.13 . Without pre-warping, they were scaled by 2π*20.

The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are reportedly eyeing Apple's new App Store subscription plan.
According to the Wall Street Journal, regulators are looking into Apple's new subscription plan, which aims to keep customers in iTunes and taking a 30 percent cut of the revenue. Apple launched its plan on Monday. On Tuesday, Google announced its own plan with less stringent terms.
Media execs spent most of the week trying to figure out what Apple's subscription rules would mean for them. A company like music subscription service Rhapsody called Apple's new rules a business model killer. The most controversial element of Apple's subscription plan is the move to ban media companies from linking customers to their own stores. Apple also said media partners couldn't offer better deals outside of the App Store.
The possible outcomes from this preliminary regulatory probe go like this:
Apple will backtrack as regulators poke around. In fact, the Feds may have just given Apple a good excuse to back down without looking like it's caving to media companies.
Apple sticks to its guns and regulators would have to determine if the company could be anticompetitive with at best a quarter of the smartphone platform market.
Media companies and their apps could leave Apple's ecosystem and focus on Android.
Door No. 1 is the most realistic scenario. Apple is likely to revise its terms to keep regulators in Europe and the U.S. at bay.

Chattanooga-based Unum said it is outsourcing some "high-volume, transactional processes," leading to the elimination of some financial positions.
Unum has contracted with EXL, a firm with headquarters in New York City, but with employees throughout the world, including many in India.
Unum officials said, despite the move, that its local employment is remaining steady.
A Unum employee whose job was cut said that this month Unum "eliminated 36 finance jobs and there will be more to come. They are giving employees three to six months to find a new job or collect severance at their end dates. They are outsourcing finance functions to an Indian-based company called EXL.
"Unum employees are to work with the Indians in a 'knowledge transfer'. There will be two types of training sessions: for those who kept their jobs and for those who are losing their jobs. There will also be cultural sensitivity training for U.S. employees.
"The IT Department is next."
Unum's Mary Clarke Guenther said, "We did eliminate a small number of transactional roles in our finance area, and those employees will all have three to six months to find other jobs with the company. With attrition and the creation of new roles, we hire about 100 people a month throughout the company. We're hopeful internal employees will be able to fill some of these positions.
"The work that is being outsourced involves high-volume, transactional processes. The company we've hired to handle those processes specializes in that kind of work. They can bring superior technology and efficiency to those processes.
"Our employment in Chattanooga has remained relatively constant for the last decade, hovering between 2600 and 2800 employees. In the last two years, the number is actually trending upward. Given the size of our company, the ways we constantly evolve to meet customer expectations, and the ongoing fluctuation of roles in different business areas, a snapshot from this kind of shift would never offer a complete or accurate picture."
EXL was incorporated in April 1999 in Delaware by a group that included Vikram Talwar and Rohit Kapoor.
EXL earlier this year was named " a Top 10 Outsourcing Service Provider" by the Information Services Group (ISG), a leading technology insights, market intelligence and advisory services company.
Should middle class Americans invest in tech startups? Outside of the small circle of angels and venture capitalists clustered in Silicon Valley doing it currently, should anyone?
This question has been prompted by the Jump start Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Signed into law in April 2012, the bill relieves small “emerging growth” businesses of complying with certain regulations deemed burdensome.
The JOBS Act also has provisions to democratize fundraising, the first of which took effect this week.
Since 1933, Federal law has prevented private, early stage companies from publicly seeking investors out of fear that the dearth of information would result in snake oil salespersons disappearing with investors' money. On Monday, Title II of the JOBS Act took effect and ended this prohibition. Now startups can tell the public - in press releases, on Twitter, or through a viral music video on YouTube - that they are raising money. Instead of seeking out the small number of known investors in Silicon Valley and other startup hubs, entrepreneurs can advertise for investors and wait for the world to come to them, cash in hand.
But this will not democratize investing in tech startups - only open up the aristocracy a bit. Investing remains limited to “accredited investors” - individuals above a certain level of wealth.
That is where Title III of the act comes in. When approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (expected in 2014), it will allow anyone to invest. Startups will be able to crowdfund their ventures like an art project on Kickstarter - $5 at a time - if they feel inclined.
The opening up of fundraising possibilities for early stage companies is meant to “jumpstart” their growth. But some have argued that it will also allow the American middle class - and not just wealthy investors - to benefit from the growth of companies like Facebook and Palantir.
Since only accredited investors can invest in startups, only wealth individuals and organizations can invest directly as angel investors or (more commonly) indirectly via a fund invested by venture capitalists. The general public has to wait to invest in emerging growth companies until they go public and offer shares on the stock market.
The logic is that since going public and being offered on a stock exchange comes with more disclosure requirements and quality controls, it is safe at that point for anyone to invest. Prior to that, only accredited investors are assumed to be sophisticated enough to understand the risks - and cushioned from the blow of failed investments.
The problem is that new technology companies like Facebook have been waiting longer and longer before they go public. One venture capitalist writes:
Microsoft went public in 1986 at roughly a $500 million market cap. Today, Microsoft has a market cap of $234 billion. Thus, the public investors in Microsoft have had the opportunity to realize $235.5 billion in market cap appreciation; the private investors had only a $500 million head-start. From IPO, a single share of Microsoft stock has appreciated close to 500x. Facebook, by contrast, went public in 2012 at roughly a $100 billion market cap. That means that, whatever public stock price appreciation Facebook has over the coming years, private investors have had a $100 billion head-start against the public investors. Even if you were prescient enough to buy Facebook at its public low of approximately a $50 billion market cap, the private investors remain way ahead. If you bought Facebook stock at its IPO, to realize a similar multiple that Microsoft's public shareholders have earned, Facebook's market cap would need to reach nearly $50 trillion, roughly the size of the total market capitalization of all publicly-traded companies in the world.
With these technology companies going public later and later, the general public is increasingly missing out on the wealth they generate.
Risky business
Some see the more democratized world of startup investing as a revolution. The CEO of a company that facilitates crowdfunding predicts that it will “rapidly transform from a world of private boardroom deals towards a more open, collaborative, and efficient online process, much of which will center around investment crowdfunding.”
Others are less impressed.
For some, the devil is in the details. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson wrote back in August that the rules proposed by the SEC were too burdensome and the potential penalty (a one year prohibition from public fundraising) stringent enough to drive startups away from raising money this way.
Others think the entire thing is a stupid idea.
“Today's a big, exciting day for anybody who has found it simply too difficult, to date, to throw their money away on idiotic gambles,” financial journalist Felix Salmon wrote on Monday. They see thousands of investors funding unworthy startups that will burn through investment money without amounting to anything. They quote an angel investor who derides “the notion/dream that somehow the internet can disintermediate social and relationship capital”:
I'd argue that this is precisely what the internet can not do: if you're going to invest in a startup, you'd better know the founders, and you'd better know something that most people do not know. Information asymmetry is the only way to lower the risk profile on such crazy risky investments.
It may sound appealing to open up investing beyond the cozy circle of the startup scene. But when it comes to investing in two twentysomethings with an idea (rather than two other twentysomethings with a different idea), it's best to be cozy. Reading about their idea online won't do.
Since the discussion of Title II of the Jobs Act has mostly been between those championing it (because they have a vested interest in crowdfunding) and those pushing back on their breathless descriptions, we thought it would be valuable to seek the boring middle ground.
Investing in the stock market can easily amount to throwing money away on idiotic gambles. That is why personal finance advises investing in mutual funds with a diverse portfolio of companies. The idea is not to pick winners, but to enjoy the market rate of return. Investors who do try to beat the market generally hire full-time professionals to do it for them.
What could be the equivalent in startup world?
When it comes to giving your money to a professional investor, the answer is pretty clear. That's what current venture capitalists do. They invest the money of very wealthy investors and large investment funds for a management fee and a cut of the profits. The only obstacle to a crowdsourced venture fund would be the venture capitalists' disinclination to deal with thousands of investors instead of a select few.
Angel investing, the process of investing smaller amounts of capital in very early stage startups, has typically been done independently. Angels invest their own money, perhaps as part of a pool with several other angels.
But as of this week, there are new models to open it up to outsiders. Angel investor Tim Ferriss, for example, is allowing accredited investors to invest in startups alongside him. In this way, ordinary investors benefit from the experience of an insider choosing the investment in exchange for a cut of any profits.
We don't know of any precedent for investing broadly in the venture market, instead of trying to pick winners. But we can imagine one. Stanford University, for example, has begun investing in its students' startups. To avoid picking winners, the fund offers to invest in any startup to come out of StartX - a Stanford-affiliated startup accelerator - that meets minimum funding requirements from professional investors.
Similarly, we can imagine crowdsourced funds playing the role of mutual funds by widely offering funding to any startup that meets certain criteria. In that way, the fund would diversify across startups while benefitting from quality control of investing only in startups able to raise money from experienced investors.
Is it worth it?
If people figure out investment vehicles like the ones described above, startups could be a high risk, high reward investment with a legitimate place in individuals' portfolios. They may even let the rest of America in on the wealth creation driven in tech centers like Silicon Valley.
The question is whether the possible benefits are worth the risk of investors (and eventually, the general public) having their money stolen by fakestartup.com or wasted on actuallyincompetentstartup.com.
While the narrative of helping the American middle class benefit from the wealth created by companies like Facebook sounds appealing, the problem is that venture capital has not been a good investment (on average) since before the dot com bubble.
The Kauffman Foundation is a nonprofit that supports entrepreneurship and entrusts a fair amount of its endowment to venture capitalists. In a report last year reviewing venture capitalist performance, Kauffman found that “venture capital returns haven't significantly outperformed the public market since the late 1990s, and, since 1997, less cash has been returned to investors than has been invested in venture capital.” Since investing in startups is riskier than bonds or ordinary stock, it needs to deliver higher returns to be worthwhile. But Kauffman found that only 20 of the 100 funds they reviewed beat the market by more than 3% - before accounting for the VC's 2% fee and 20% cut of the profits - and mostly on the strength of gains from before the dot com bubble burst.
This suggests that ordinary Americans are not exactly missing out on a golden opportunity. And more money pouring in from outside investors would not be unlikely to find good investment opportunities. Kauffman also found that smaller venture capital funds did better (or at least those below $500 million in size) and argued that “with six times the capital invested every year this decade than was invested in the entire decade of the 1980s, too much capital is the problem.” The number of good opportunities is just too small to support the entrance of everyone's retirement savings, or even just a large number of outsiders looking for a piece of the action.
It's an appealing storyline that ordinary Americans should be able to get in on the wealth created by the next Google or Facebook that currently goes just to a small number of industry insiders. But people don't seem to be missing out on that much. Just as each smash hit like LinkedIn hides countless failed attempts to be the next billion dollar company, a few well performing venture capital funds hide the fact that most experience lackluster returns. The answer to the question of who should invest in startups may be… the people who do now.

President Obama met behind closed doors for four hours Wednesday with 33 representatives from civil rights groups, law enforcement and state and local government, seeking to forge a consensus on how best to address racial bias in policing.
The extraordinary session came a day after Obama delivered remarks in Dallas that honored the five police officers killed a week ago during a peaceful protest that came in response to recent shootings of two African American men in Baton Rouge and suburban St. Paul, Minn. On Thursday, the president is scheduled to participate in a town-hall event on race that will be simultaneously televised on ESPN and ABC.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday after the meeting, the president said the tensions between many police departments and the communities they police will continue for some time.
“As I said yesterday, I do not want to gloss over the fact that not only are there very real problems, but there are still deep divisions about how to solve these problems,” they said. “We have to, as a country, sit down and just grind it out, solve these problems. And I think if we have that kind of sustained commitment, I'm confident we can do so.”
[Obama speaks at Dallas memorial]
President Obama met with senior police officials and Black Lives Matter activists on July 13, and said more must be done to build trust and investigate police use of force. "The roots of the problems we saw this week date back, not just decades, date back centuries," Obama said. (Reuters)
The list of invitees included four mayors, five chiefs of police and more than half a dozen civil rights leaders. Some of those attending hailed from communities that have experienced violence in the past couple of weeks, including Pastor Frederick Haynes of South Dallas's Friendship-West Baptist Church and Mayor Chris Coleman of St. Paul. Others hailed from cities and states with large minority populations, such as Los Angeles, Newark, Georgia and Maryland.
As Obama spoke, the group of men and women dressed in everything from police uniforms to three-piece suits sat around a large rectangular table in an Eisenhower Executive Office Building conference room.
“And I want to emphasize that there's still a diversity of views around this table,” the president said. “That was by design.”
Maryland Senate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings (R), one of the participants, said in an interview that Obama asked “everybody to be honest and frank, and that's what we were.”
African American activists spoke about racial profiling, according to several participants, while law enforcement officials and some politicians spoke of the need for protesters to demonstrate more respect.
Rashad Robinson, executive director of the black political advocacy group ColorOfChange, said they and others challenged police officials to acknowledge misconduct within their ranks.
“At some point, they need to start speaking up about bad cops to protect good cops,” they said. “I think they listened.”

In part, Obama convened the meeting to ensure that the issue of gun violence and racial inequities does not fade the way it often does once Americans turn their focus away from high-profile shooting incidents to other matters. On Tuesday, they lamented how quickly the public reverts to habitual complacency once it gets a little distance from searing events.
“And I've seen how a spirit of unity, born of tragedy, can gradually dissipate, overtaken by the return to business as usual, by inertia and old habits and expediency,” they said. “I see how easily we slip back into our old notions, because they're comfortable, we're used to them.”
On Wednesday, the National League of Cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors announced they would work with the White House “to convene 100 community conversations on race relations, justice, policing and equality.”
Does America have too much oil in its reserves?
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon fired off a letter this week asking the Department of Energy to study the "size and make-up" of the U.S.' Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
It comes fresh on the heels of a report on Monday from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office that also called for a similar review.
The U.S. has the largest emergency stockpile of oil in the world. And now that the country's oil production is booming, there are questions if America needs to hold so much crude in reserve. The Department of Energy didn't respond to a request for comment.
Congress created the reserve in response to the 1973 oil embargo, which caused a supply shock and a recession.
But the United States is now on track to surpass Saudi Arabia as the world's largest energy producer next year. That's thanking in large part to new technologies such as hydraulic fracking, which has made the extraction of oil and gas from shale rock commercially viable.

"The recent shale boom is having a profound effect on United States energy policy," Wyden wrote to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.
The talk of shrinking the oil reserve is a major shift from the political debates of the past years, when Americans were being squeezed by high gas prices.
In 2008, the Congress passed legislation that temporarily halted deposits of oil into the reserves.
Three years later, when the global economy was at risk of an oil supply shock due to the war in Libya, the United States and 28 other nations tapped their strategic reserves.

Fast forward to today, and the situation looks very different. Oil prices in the United States have tumbled to the lowest levels since 2012, and gas prices have fallen below $3 a gallon in many parts of the country.
Currently, there's enough oil in storage to meet the nation's needs for 106 days. In contrast, most oil consuming nations have 90 days of oil supply in storage.
Wyden says energy policies put in place as recently as 2007 are now "at best irrelevant, or at worst detrimental, to national environmental and economic goals."
Are the developers of software that leads to a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain (like Bitcoin Classic) subject to regulation under the Bank Secrecy Act?
Some recent blogs posts have raised an interesting question: are the developers of software that leads to a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain (like Bitcoin Classic) subject to regulation under the Bank Secrecy Act? Do they therefore have an obligation to register with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and comply with all its relevant rule? What about miners running the new software?
Interesting questions, but with a pretty straight-forward answer: no reasonable reading of the 2013 FinCEN guidance supports this conclusion. Decentralized Virtual Currencies, forked or no, do not have administrators for the purposes of FinCEN regulation, and therefore no protocol-level developer would need to register as an MSB. Let's walk through all this with a careful, step-by-step, and well-hyperlinked description of what types of Bitcoin activities FinCEN does regulate, and put aside for now what it might regulate with respect to a fork.
What FinCEN does regulate—through their Bank Secrecy Act implementing regulations—are Money Services Businesses or “MSBs.” MSB, as a super-category of business, includes: dealers in foreign exchange, check cashers, issuers and sellers of traveler's checks, providers of prepaid access, money transmitters, the US post office (yep), and sellers of prepaid access.
Thus far, FinCEN has insisted that virtual currency related businesses are not prepaid access providers or sellers, nor is a virtual currency exchange a “foreign exchange,” nor does it have (more obviously) anything to do with checks or the post office.
But according to the 2013 virtual currency guidance various activities relating to virtual currency are money transmission as defined in the implementing regs. Those activities are “exchanging” and “administering”—and so we can think of these two activities as two subsets of being a money transmitter utilizing virtual currency.
So, to be regulated by FinCEN a person performing some cryptocurrency-related activity needs to fall under the definition of a Money Transmitter as found in the BSA implementing regulations.
That definition of Money transmitter is as follows:
“(A) A person that provides money transmission services. The term “money transmission services” means the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means. . . .
(B) Any other person engaged in the transfer of funds.”
So, does a developer or miner fit this definition? First, what do we have here when it comes to miners?
In FinCEN's own words: mining “involve[s] neither ‘acceptance' nor ‘transmission' of the convertible virtual currency and [is] not the transmission of funds within the meaning of the Rule.”
Notice, the implementing regs define money transmitters as those who both accept and transmitvalue. Even apart from FinCEN's ruling above, acceptance has a legal definition in the payments context, and it is generally understood as: “the receipt of a check or other negotiable instrument by a bank or another drawee.” A bitcoin transaction message relayed to a miner is not a “negotiable instrument” because it is not an “unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money.” If I try to send you a bitcoin, but my transaction message doesn't get relayed or included in a block, I am not in breach of any promise to pay you (assuming we don't have any other agreements).
Take note: contrary to some commentary in the twitterverse, this reasoning does not rely on whether Bitcoin mining is sufficiently “decentralized.” Even if one miner had all the hashing power on the network, they still wouldn't be “accepting” and “transmitting” and still would not be an MSB according to FinCEN.
If miners are not MSBs, then that means they are not Financial Institutions, and therefore they are not subject to FinCEN regulations, like the registration requirement, under the Bank Secrecy Act.
That said, FinCEN could decide to begin a new rulemaking, define cryptocurrency miners, and add them to the list of defined Financial Institutions in Chapter X. They have that power under the Bank Secrecy Act because the list of Financial Institutions in the statute includes: “any business or agency which engages in any activity which the Secretary of the Treasury determines, by regulation, to be an activity which is similar to, related to, or a substitute for any activity in which any business described in this paragraph is authorized to engage”
“By regulation” means that such a new regulation would have to be promulgated via the normal, APA mandated notice and comment process, which generally takes months, even years. So while this is all possible (although unlikely), it would be a slow, transparent, and notorious development. No midnight raids for miners.
Now, software development. Does hypothetical Bitcoin core dev XT or NG or WTF (or Dogecoin core for that matter!) need to register as an MSB? Again, the answer is no.
The same analysis above applies as well to developers as it does to miners: They neither accept nor do they transmit. To again quote FinCEN itself: “The production and distribution of software, in and of itself, does not constitute acceptance and transmission of value, even if the purpose of the software is to facilitate the sale of virtual currency.”
But here's where it gets really interesting! Recall that in our earlier discussion FinCEN could probably succeed in having a rulemaking to add mining to the list of regulated Financial Institutions. It would be very difficult to do the same with a software developer.
First, you'd have to question whether a software designer “is similar to, related to, or a substitute for” a bank or financial institution. Personally I think that would be an absurd interpretation. A network of interconnected computers may be (miners, users, etc. taken as a whole) but a person who merely writes some C++, on their own, is no substitute for a bank. Are they “similar” to a bank? No. Are they “related” to a bank? It's difficult to even know what that means in this context.
If you are familiar with administrative law, however, you'll know that the agency gets a fair amount of leeway in interpreting statutes—it's called Chevron Deference—but we'd only get the result after a lengthy court case on top of a lengthy rule-making. So maybe this could still go forward (but it'd require some serious will and political capital on FinCEN's part—far different than issuing guidance). And yet there's more.
Second, you'd have to question whether the software designer, under this new rule, is being restrained, in advance, from publishing source code. Mandating registration as a necessary condition to speak is something we frown upon here in the U.S. because it has been consistently found to be unconstitutional under the First Amendment. This even includes a case dealing with the publication of encryption source code and matters of national security.
If that analysis holds, then even congress could not make a law that forces developers to register!Next option is a constitutional amendment but we probably do not need to go there, this post is long enough.
Fork away, or don't; but worry about the technical or community implications rather than the law; the regulatory landscape is indifferent.
Man Yelling “FREE BIRD” at Concert Can't Find Anyone to Adopt Their Pet Cockatoo
PHILADELPHIA — Local pet owner Dylan Murphy could not find a suitable adoptive home for their beloved pet cockatoo last week, despite incessantly screaming “FREE BIRD!” at a recent all-ages punk show, according to aggravated witnesses.
“I tried yelling, ‘FREE COCKATOO TO A LOVING HOME — SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY!' But that was too wordy. So, I shortened it to ‘FREE BIRD,' and screamed it between every song,” said Murphy with the cockatoo, Beansy, sitting calmly on their wrist. “Most people ignored me or gave me a dirty look. When I tried politely to push to the front to get everyone's attention, people shoved me back. Some even threatened me. Maybe they just weren't animal lovers?”
Due to an impending move overseas, Murphy hoped to find their pet a new home before leaving the country. After several Craigslist ads failed to garner any serious attention, however, they made a last-ditch effort to find a caretaker among the roughly 50 fellow show-goers.
“There was one super-drunk guy who thought my offer was hilarious. This isn't a joke — I'm actually really worried about what will happen to her,” said Murphy. “She's so smart. I trained them to say, ‘Play a fast one!' But the opening band got really offended when Beansy said it.”
Members of Surf Coffin, the headlining band, were reportedly very aware of Murphy's presence.
“Oh, yeah. Fuck that guy,” said drummer Dave Huston. “I mean, Skynyrd's fine and all, but that joke stopped being funny 30 years ago. Maybe it was ironically funny like, 10 years ago, but now, it's just annoying.”
For their part, animal care experts strongly advise against adopting pets at punk shows.
“Please do not give away birds, dogs, hamsters, or any other kind of pet at a concert — punk or otherwise. Honestly, I shouldn't have to say that,” said Nikki Cullen of Quaker City Animal Shelter. “Can you tell them to bring the bird here? Please? ”

Aether Revolt is on the horizon, and we're days away from the release of the set. We just had a set of bannings and now, more than ever, I think Grixis Control is in a position to make a claim to one of the top spots in the Modern metagame.
We'll start with the talk of the town, Fatal Push. Fatal Push is a card that black was really looking for. To play a control deck in Modern, you were almost forced to play either white or red for cheap forms of interaction. White offers an unconditional piece of removal in Path to Exile, but the cost of giving your opponent an extra land is pricey if you're looking to take the game 10-12 turns deep without the clock of something like a Tarmogoyf. Red offers Lightning Bolt and with it the ability to kill smaller creatures with ease, fight troubling planeswalkers, and when it's time to end the game, aim them right at your opponent's dome. Green, black, and blue, however, didn't have access to these powerful effects—at least, not at this level.
Black, the color know for killing creatures, finally gets to join this company thanks to Aether Revolt. Disfigure was too narrow, Murderous Cut too much setup when some of to delve creatures were the best threats in the format, and Dismember was always terrifying, as 2 or 4 life could be the difference in a game of Magic.
Enter Fatal Push, and it addresses each problem the previous removal spells left on the table. It kills a wider array of creatures than Disfigure, has a more manageable set-up cost than Murderous Cut, and doesn't cost life like Dismember does. This card is the real deal, and will allow black-based control decks to not rely on white or red for their cheap interaction. When it comes to Grixis Control, it allows the deck to become even more low to the ground, more mana efficient, and that much more of a threat to the Modern metagame.
In addition to the new toys in Aether Revolt, the DCI decided to take action against 2 cards in Modern: Gitaxian Probe and Golgari Grave-Troll. While this doesn't affect Grixis Control directly, this is an archetype that is completely reacting to the threats your opponents deploy. Therefore, as other players change their decks and adapt to a changing environment, you will need to as well. Not only will you see a decline in Death's Shadow Aggro and Kiln Fiend Prowess, you'll see a more resilient and slower form of Dredge sprout up and Infect become more explosive but also more fragile. With this information, you also need to look at decks you should expect to see more or less of with the change in the metagame. This initial look will be short-term, as this will be the knee-jerk reactions by the community. Given a few major tournaments and maybe a PPTQ season or two, we'll see the metagame settle eventually.
Big Mana Decks: Titanshift/Eldrazi/Tron
I expect each of these decks to get slightly more popular, but to reach about the same win rate they have now. These decks are built to fight the 3-color midrange decks and can really struggle with fast combo as they give up the first few turns of the game to set up their over-the-top game plan. I expect these decks to get bigger as they had weak matchups against Gitaxian Probe decks and had reasonable-to-good matchups against Dredge. They'll also do well against the decks awaiting Fatal Push, and you'll need to keep this in mind when constructing your 75 to make sure you have tools for these decks in Grixis Control.
Burn
With the loss of other aggro decks and Infect becoming more of a glass cannon, I expect Burn to be a popular choice for those who are used to playing these creature combo strategies. While these were a good matchup for Burn, if Titanshift and Tron do grow in popularity, Burn is solid against these decks. In addition, seeing Dredge slow down will give Burn a much better chance to have the staying power it once had. I don't expect Burn to be the best deck in the format, but I expect it to become a big player once again.
Affinity
Affinity was in a rough place over the last 4 months. Dredge was a tough matchup, and the Gitaxian Probe decks were also fairly effective against Affinity. I expect Affinity to become more popular and it will likely have a good shot in the next few tournaments until people adjust their sideboards from graveyard hate cards and Sudden Shocks into cards like Ancient Grudge and Creeping Corrosion.
So where does this leave Grixis Control? Based on the Cryptic Command version of the deck, this is what I would play if Grand Prix Vancouver were this weekend:
Grixis Control
If you've followed my previous versions of Grixis Control, you'll see more fetchlands here to help support the revolt ability of Fatal Push. While the 2-cmc mode is the more useful one for Modern play, you'll still want to be able to kill creatures like Thought-Knot Seer, Master of Waves, and Huntmaster of the Fells. I tried out the Bloodstained Mires and found them really ineffective in this version of the deck because you wanted to fetch basic Island, and often had to shock yourself in the early game for Watery Grave or Steam Vents.
The sideboard has also changed as a result of the bannings and expected metagame shift. There are now 2 copies of Negate to help fight TitanShift and Tron strategies. Collective Brutality and Negate take the place of the Sun Droplets, and are also useful in fighting the Burn decks and adaptations to the Infection strategies should they move back to playing something like Wild Defiance. The Jace, Architect of Thought is a reaction to the amount of Lingering Souls I expect to crop up from Abzan, and potentially Faeries or White-Black Tokens, as both make good use of Fatal Push and have token creatures, which the Aether Revolt instant will struggle against.
The other version of Grixis Control that might crop up more if we see decks like Infect become more glass-cannon-esque, is a tap-out, Jace, Vryn's Prodigy build with Fatal Push and Yahenni's Expertise. This list is rougher, but I can see it becoming successful in the future with some work, and a metagame that shifts away from big mana decks and spell-based combo decks:
Grixis Tap-Out Control
Again, this list will need a lot more testing, as it's not a shell I've played with enough, and we'll really need to see what the cycle of Expertise cards brings to the table. It's possible to put cards into your deck that you cannot cast with the lands, and only expect to cast off of cards like Yahenni's Expertise. While I expect that to be an exception and not the rule, it's a possibility deck builders will look for. Jace combos with Fatal Push by exiling itself and then re-entering the battlefield transformed.
I'm looking forward to Fatal Push more than any Magic card printed in the last few years. This card screams powerful—Mike Sigrist said the card is better than Path to Exile, and I agree. This is the new bar to pass to become one of the best creature removal spells in Magic's history. Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile will still be very popular, but Fatal Push is going to join the duo of headliners in Eternal formats for many years to come. Now instead of looking for creatures with 4 toughness to get around Lightning Bolt, we'll need to look to creatures in the 3- and 5-converted-mana-cost category to see if we can find a hidden gem to get around Fatal Push's efficiency, like Goblin Dark-Dwellers and Keranos, God of Storms, or see if planeswalkers will begin to pick up in popularity in Modern as a result of the Fatal Push.
Live Nation, one of the biggest event companies in the world, has issued a statement in response to the Manchester Terror Attacks. The company has decided to elevate security measures at it's upcoming events, most notably the Sasquatch! Music Festival.
Live Nation Is Taking No Risks
The statement which was once posted to the festival's wall and has since been hidden to read that no bags will be allowed in the festival outside of small purses, or one gallon clear backpacks. CCTV will be in effect for all lines. Camelbacks will be allowed in the festival if they meet the dimensions stated and are emptied of all water. Long wait times are expected when entering the festival. We have reached out to Sasquatch Music Festival to see why the post has been removed from their wall.
As of now there has only been official word from one of Live Nation's many festivals on these increased security measures. Stay tuned as we learned more both from Sasquatch and Live Nation.
To Short or Not to Short? It sometimes feels like the eternal question without a definitive answer every filmmaker asks herself/himself at some point, when dreaming of making a feature film.
Every year, an unknown filmmaker creates the buzz with a short film that looks a million bucks and unlocks them the doors to Paradise (getting representation and a Studio deal to make a feature film). It doesn't matter if half of those filmmakers disappear in development hell and that we never actually see the feature film, those stories feed our collective imagination, pushing us to ask again: to short or not to short?
A handful of filmmakers has successfully adapted their short films into a feature. As we've seen in the past on mentorless, sometimes the short is a scene from a screenplay that can't get financed, and sometimes it becomes the inspiration for a back-up plan after a project failed. Sometimes it's also a way for a crew to find out if they're fit to work together on a bigger project.
As often, motivations vary, but the result is a same, a short that has become a feature. I've looked long and hard on the net and chose 20 filmmakers, from George Lucas to Damien Chazelle who made a feature based on an often eponym short film.
Unlike the infographic dedicated to filmmakers who started making films well into their 30s, To Short or Not to Short lacks diversity in nationalities, races and gender, but the film genres do vary, from the expected horror and sci-fi shorts to the indie drama, and comedy. The sample is way too thin to deduct anything scientific out of it, but it's still worth noting.
Check the result below, and after that for more articles about short films, including the journey of some of the filmmakers present on this list. And if other names come to your mind, please do share them in the comments section!

Auburn and football coach Gus Malzahn came to terms on a contract extension through the 2020 season.
The school released an updated amendment to Malzahn's contract, which was previously amended on the eve of the 2013 SEC Championship game and signed in March 2014, on Monday.
Under the terms of the new agreement, which was signed on April 1, Malzahn will make $4.725 million per year through Dec. 31, 2020.
Their previous deal was through Dec. 31, 2019 and had Malzahn earning $4.35 million in 2016, with an increase of $250,000 per year. In 2016 and 2017, Malzahn will earn a combined $500,000 more than they would have under their previous amended contract, but they will earn a combined $500,000 less in 2018 and 2019, making the only difference on paper the additional year in 2020.
Already among the top-paid college football coaches, Malzahn will likely rank in the top 10 nationally and trail only Alabama's Nick Saban and Texas A&M's Kevin Sumlin in the SEC, according to USA TODAY's coaching salaries database.
Jay Jacobs: Gus Malzahn will be Auburn head coach for 'long, long time' Jay Jacobs believes Gus Malzahn will be Auburn's football coach for a "long, long time."
During last week's SEC Spring Meetings in Destin, Florida, Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs said Malzahn would be the Tigers coach for a "long, long time" and said they were the "the right guy for Auburn" moving forward.
"He's a brilliant offensive mind," Jacobs said last week. "Took us to two national championships; once as a coordinator, once as a head coach. There are a bunch of schools in this league that would love to be in our position with a guy like him.
"It's tough league, this league is tough every day. It doesn't matter what year it is, year in, year out, how many years you've been here, whatever it may be, but there's no doubt about that they are the right guy for Auburn."
Terms of Malzahn's buyout, both if they were to leave Auburn or if Auburn were to part ways with him, have not changed, with the exception of the additional year of money they would be owed if Auburn were to terminate the deal.
Malzahn would be owed $2,237,500 per year remaining on their contract if Auburn were to part ways with him.
If Malzahn were to leave Auburn before the end of 2020, they would owe Auburn the total of any outstanding payments owed to their assistants who either don't follow them to a new employer or are not retained by the new coaching staff.
Since leading Auburn to the 2013 SEC Championship and to within 13 seconds of the BCS National Championship, Malzahn has had back-to-back disappointing seasons, going 8-5 in 2014 and 7-6 in 2015, and has lost five straight SEC home games, last winning against South Carolina on Oct. 25, 2014.
Auburn suffered an offensive identity crisis and finished in the bottom four of the SEC in nearly every major defensive statistic last season.
Auburn's quest to get back to 'who we say we are' on offense Auburn is trying to find what it lost in 2015.
Malzahn had to hire five new members of their coaching staff, including Kevin Steele to be the third defensive coordinator during their four-year tenure and the team's fifth in six years. The other four new assistant coaches are on two-year contracts that, combined with Steele's three-year, $3.6 million contract, total $975,000 less than what their predecessors would have been owed in 2016.
"We feel very good about our staff," Malzahn said last month, "and we feel very good about the future."
Auburn opens the 2016 season against reigning ACC Champion and national runner-up Clemson at 8 p.m. CT (ESPN) on Sept. 3 at Jordan-Hare Stadium.
A former senior MI6 officer has criticised the torture and abuse of terror suspects and says the US response to the threat posed by al-Qaida has been exaggerated and counterproductive.
Stinging criticism of the US is made in the Guardian by Nigel Inkster, assistant chief of MI6 until 2006.
In the article, which appeared originally in the International Institute for Strategic Studies journal Survival, Inkster and co-author Alexander Nicoll write: "It is surely not inspiring for radicalised people with the potential for violent action to see terrorists tried in ordinary criminal courts and sentenced to long prison terms." The authors, both senior IISS members, add: "But it surely is inspiring to them to see terrorists treated as a special class of prisoners to be held by the military, imprisoned without trial and tortured. This is the kind of treatment that makes jihadists believe that they can indeed be the fighters for a cause that they aspire to be."
Abandoning "ordinary standards of criminal justice" in terrorism cases can be counterproductive, they say. "On top of this, there is the argument that democratic values … are the [west's] the best advertisement. Departures from such values have damaged America's … reputation."
Senior officers in MI6, and MI5 the domestic security service, at the time privately expressed serious concern about the Bush administration's "war on terror" and what many of them believed was an unlawful invasion of Iraq. Two months ago, Eliza Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, disclosed that Britain lodged a protest to the US about the treatment of detainees.
America's "frenzied, alarmist response" to the failed attempt by a Nigerian apparently to blow up a US airliner last Christmas Day "is hardly becoming for the most powerful nation on earth", Inkster and Nicoll said. "The lack of any sense of proportion simply serves to enhance the status of a terrorist group which is dispersed, quite small and cannot possibly threaten US sovereignty unless Americans connive in their own defeat."
The huge expense of Bush's "global war on terror", they said, had arguably caused more damage to the world economy than Osama bin Laden could have hoped for. "Nobody can forget the horror of 9/11, and it was inevitable that a government faced with such an outrage would respond in extreme fashion. Hindsight is easy, but if Bush had placed more emphasis on bringing those responsible to justice rather than on declaring an unwinnable 'war' against an undefined enemy, things might have turned out very differently."
AUGUSTA — Maine voters are trying to make up their minds about being first in the nation to use a ranked choice system to vote for members of Congress, the Legislature and governor.
A recent Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center shows that 48 percent of likely voters support the ranked choice method.
However, the poll also found that 23 percent of voters were undecided and 29 percent will vote against the change.
The switch would make Maine the first state to adopt the system, which allows voters to rank candidates by preference instead of choosing a single candidate for each race come Election Day.
The system is used now for Portland's mayoral and City Council races and has been adopted by other cities in the U.S., but Maine would be the first state to use the system or all statewide elections, including votes for the Legislature, Congress and governor.
The poll, which included more than 500 likely voters and surveyed both mobile and land-line telephones, was conducted in mid-September. The question will appear as Question 5 on the ballot Nov. 8.
Kyle Bailey, the campaign manager for Yes on 5, said the campaign was pleased with the numbers, but noted that other polls suggest stronger support and fewer undecided voters.
“We know there are a lot of undecided voters out there who haven't heard about this or need more information,” Bailey said.
It's a point that could be critical to the campaign's success in 2016, according to Andy Smith, a political scientist and the director of the UNH Survey Center. Smith said with four other ballot questions facing voters, and two of those on the hot-button issues of guns and marijuana, how Mainers vote may not be at the forefront of voters' minds come November.
“It's not an issue that most people are very concerned about and it's certainly not something that people are going to think about very often,” Smith said. They also said the fact that having to explain how ranked choice voting works makes for a difficult sell.
Smith said undecided voters will typically vote no on a question they don't fully understand. “It's a very foreign idea and something that's hard to explain in a short period of time, especially when there are a lot of other things going on, other issues that are more visible or more understandable like legalizing marijuana, for example.”
That's why the Yes on 5 campaigns is focused on informing voters about how ranked choice voting works. If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the top votes cast after the first tally, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated. Voters who chose the eliminated candidate have their ballots added to the totals of their second-ranked candidate and the ballots are retabulated. This process continues until one candidate has a majority of votes and is declared the winner.
“If your favorite candidate can't win and no candidate gets an outright majority your vote is not wasted, it counts for the candidate you ranked as your second choice to help us reach a majority winner who is more broadly supported by voters,” Bailey said.
The poll indicates that Republicans are more likely to reject changing Maine's voting laws with 43 percent or a plurality of those polled saying they would vote against the measure. That compares to 61 percent of Democrats and 45 percent of independents who support the switch.
Younger people surveyed showed higher levels of support for the change, with 51 percent aged 18 to 49 saying they will vote for the switch, while among voters aged 50 and over, only 46 percent saying they favor the change.
Fifty seven percent of voters in households earning less than $30,000 a year supported the proposal, but voters with higher incomes were less enthusiastic. In households earning $30,000 to $60,000, 48 percent supported the measure, while 49 percent supported in households earning more than $60,000.

Help us fix Canada's antiquated wine laws at winecampaign.ca
Two years ago, Toronto lawyer Ian Blue published an article in Advocates Quarterly claiming that the legislation underpinning Canada's provincial liquor monopolies was unconstitutional.
Blue was referencing the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act of 1928, a Prohibition-era law which gives provinces the power to fine or arrest anyone who brings liquor into a province without selling it to that province's liquor board.
Blue argued that the law is unconstitutional because it violates the Constitution Act of 1867 which, in section 121, requires that items of “growth, produce, and manufacture to be admitted free from one province into another.” Legislation that forces breweries and wineries to sell their products to a provincial liquor board is clearly contrary to that principle, Blue argued.
So Canada's provincial liquor monopolies, which account for billions of dollars a year in provincial income, are based on a little-known, illegal law. Surely this must have garnered some attention in Canada's press?
Not so. Blue wrote a column in the National Post and made a few TV appearances, but the story got almost no traction. Few Canadians seemed to care about the constitutionality of a piece of legislation passed during Prohibition.
“[The LCBO's] monopoly is based solely on an unconstitutional federal law, the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act (IILA) passed almost 90 years ago. The law is unconstitutional because it violates section 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867….”
Ian Blue, Vice, January 16, 2014
In 2012, parliament passed an amendment to the IILA which allowed individuals to carry a “personal amount” of wine, beer or booze across a provincial border, as defined by each province.
Many media outlets trumpeted the amendment as a victory for Canada's wineries and breweries, but from a constitutional perspective, this amendment fixed nothing. Blue's original argument was that the provinces never had the right to restrict the movement of goods across their borders in the first place — that's why they asked the federal government to pass the IILA. So why do we still have provincial liquor monopolies?
So why do we still have provincial liquor monopolies?
At this point, anyone new to this topic might assume that the debate over provincial liquor monopolies in Canada represents a classic choice between private and public interest. But it's a lot more complicated than that.
The idea that privatization would decrease tax revenue is not entirely accurate — many studies have shown that increasing the number of private liquor outlets would increase tax revenues.
The social argument for government control of liquor distribution — that the shorter hours and higher prices at provincial liquor stores decrease overall consumption and prevent binge drinking and alcoholism, for example — is also a misguided one. There is no reason why private liquor stores could not be subjected to similar regulations and constraints.
In the end, the most compelling explanation for the persistence of provincial liquor monopolies seems to be the issue of control.
In the end, the most compelling explanation for the persistence of provincial liquor monopolies seems to be the issue of control.
Big wineries and breweries, Ian Blue explained to Vice in 2014, favour the present system because it gives them “free distribution.”
This claim might puzzle some Canadians. If provincial monopolies are government-controlled, how can they favour big brewers and wineries?
Perhaps the most salient example can be found in Ontario, where outside of provincially-run LCBO stores, the only other place Ontario citizens have been able to buy beer (until very recently) is the Beer Store.
Though not operated by the LCBO, the Beer Store benefits from and is effectively part of Ontario's provincial liquor monopoly. What most Ontarioans don't realize is that the Beer Store is a private company, with private shareholders. Here is a list of the Beer Store's primary shareholders:
Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev) — 49%
Molson Coors Brewing Company — 49%
Sleeman Breweries (Sapporo) — 2%
That's right. A substantial chunk of Ontario's liquor monopoly is owned by three large corporations, none of which are Canadian. An Angus Reid survey in 2013 found that only 13% of Ontario residents were aware of this fact.
The Wine Rack, Ontario's largest private wine retailer, has a similar arrangement with the province. They're owned by Constellation Brands, the largest wine producer in the world.
So why don't Canada's smaller wineries challenge provincial liquor monopolies, despite the fact that they've been proven to hinder the growth of wineries?
Blue says that smaller breweries, wineries and distilleries are afraid to challenge the system due to a simple fear of being delisted in provincial stores.
“Small breweries and wineries are afraid to challenge the system for fear of being delisted in LCBO stores.”
— Ian Blue, Vice, January 16, 2014
The conflict, then, is not between private and public interests, but between entrenched interests, and Canada's smaller wineries and breweries, whose only goal is to distribute their product across the country and operate in a fair competitive environment.
These are the people who would benefit the most if the IILA were reformed or repealed — smaller wine merchants, small wineries, artisanal breweries.

All we need to know about the president's speech on climate change is revealed by what's missing: Nowhere did they tell us what effects on future temperatures or climate can be expected from their policy proposals on greenhouse gases (GHG).
So let's do that math. U.S. GHG emissions are about 17 percent of global emissions. If we apply the widely accepted MAGICC climate model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and if we assume the international Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change midrange emissions path, an immediate cut in U.S. emissions by half would yield a reduction in global temperatures of 0.1 degrees Celsius 100 years from now.
Forget the president's assertions about opponents' heads being stuck in the sand. Look instead at the actual evidence. There has been no temperature trend over the last 15 or so years despite increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG. The earth has been emerging from the Little Ice Age since roughly 1850; accordingly, temperatures increased from about 1910 through about 1940, were roughly constant through about 1980, increased until 1998, and have exhibited no trend since then. How much of this long-term upward trend is anthropogenic? No one knows, and those who claim to know don't.
The past 12 months have set a record for the fewest tornadoes ever in a similar period. There has been no trend since 1950 in the frequency of strong (F3 to F5) tornadoes in the U.S. The number of wildfires is in a long-term decline. It has been almost eight years since a Category 3 or higher hurricane landed on the U.S. coast.
The proponents of climate policies have depended heavily on anecdotes (“Hurricane Sandy!”) and the predictions made by various climate models. The models, however, cannot predict: the warming around a millennium ago, the Little Ice Age; or the subsequent patterns after 1850. All climate models predict that GHG emissions would create an enhanced heating effect in the tropical midtroposphere; but neither the satellites nor the weather balloons can find it, a reality that raises serious questions about our understanding of the underlying atmospheric physics. In short: Models can predict neither the past nor the present. It is far from obvious that policymakers should have faith in their predictions about the future.
The president's proposals will penalize areas and industries disproportionately dependent on coal-fired power. A recent MIT study concludes that the winners will be the Pacific coast, New England and New York. The losers: the south-central and mountain states and Texas.
The winners are states with high power costs or with significant inexpensive hydroelectric resources that would be unaffected by GHG policies. The losers are states with low energy costs driven by disproportionate use of coal-fired power. By driving power costs up in the latter group of states, the GHG policies would reduce the competitive disadvantages of the former group.
This issue is about wealth redistribution from red states to blue, and not about carbon dioxide, which, in the Orwellian language of the left, is “carbon pollution.” It is not toxic to humans at many times current ambient concentrations. It protects plants from various environmental stresses. It is like no other effluent; for those, less is better. That is true as well for the coercion and government planning authority inherent in the Obama proposals.

This is the £2,499 (~$3,800) coat made entirely out of men's chest hair. It contains around a million individual hairs and took over 200-hours to weave. Now pat yourself on the back for not being the person who spent 200 hours of their life weaving men's chest hairs.
The coat was commissioned by milk drink for men, Wing Co., as a protest against the widespread 'manning-down' of British men, typified by clean-shaven chests and emasculating fashion.
Pfft, who cares if a guy wants to shave their chest or wear emasculating clothes. That just makes being a REAL MAN like me even rarer. Just kidding, I totally shave my chest. But only because it grows in patchy plus when I shave it my tits look smaller.
Hit the jump for one more shot of this lady and a dude modeling the thing that looks like the exact kind of dude they were complaining about in the first place.
Thanks to Prince Mess and sasha, who both have slap bracelets made from peeled sunburn skin. I think I'm gonna puke.
Politics Jeb Bush outlines plans to limit federal control of Western lands The presidential hopeful would move Interior Department from Washington to the West.
Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush this week waded deeper into issues of public land than any other candidate has yet, promising to ease Washington's grip over the region. During a visit to Nevada, they proposed to transplant the Interior Department from Washington, D.C., to one of the big cities of the West.
Bush's Western Land and Resource Management agenda includes initiatives tantalizing both to industry and conservationists. They pledged to undo the Obama administration's Clean Water Rule, which provides more protection for small streams and wetlands. But they also promised to prioritize public access to federal lands and permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which, as HCN reported, Congress recently let expire. John Pemble
The general gist of Bush's comments on public lands matched their overall political mantra: Limit Washington, D.C.'s influence over the rest of the country and increase state and local control. The former governor of Florida said they would defer to states in managing wildlife, streams and wetlands and in deciding when and where to establish national monuments.
“If you just start with the premise that people in their own communities actually care about their communities more than someone that's removed from 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 miles away,” Bush said Wednesday during a small event with Nevada leaders at Rancho San Rafael Regional Park in Reno.
Bush says they would aim to treat Western communities as partners in managing federal lands. “First and foremost let's build a partnership that's not top down,” Bush said in Reno. “I think you'll find that the pressures, you know frustrations, would subside.”
One idea Bush has to improve the relationship between Washington and the West is to move the Interior Department. They suggest Denver, Reno and Salt Lake City as possible new homes.
“Historically, presidents export a Secretary of the Interior from the West to Washington, D.C. It is time to import the Department from Washington, D.C., to the West,” Bush's plan states.
On the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Bush pledged to permanently reauthorize the popular 50-year-old conservation program, which has provided funds to buy local parks and expand national parks and forests. But Bush said they would divert some money for maintenance projects for national parks as a 100th anniversary present to the National Park Service.
Despite the small size of the Reno event, some protesters were on hand and they chanted: “Keep public lands public!”
Nevada has been a hotspot of the movement to transfer federal lands to local control. Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who has long refused to pay grazing fees to the Bureau of Land Management, became a celebrity of the movement by staging a standoff with BLM agents in 2014. The League of Conservation Voters accused Bush of encouraging such behavior.
“Jeb Bush's proposal comes straight out of the playbook of Nevada's own Cliven Bundy,” says Seth Stein, the press secretary of the League of Conservation Voters. “It will weaken the protections for the public lands that belong to everyone.”
But former Nevada Lt. Gov. Gov. Brian Krolicki told KRNV television that Bush demonstrated that they understand issues that are crucial to Nevada.
Although public lands in the West have received little attention from the candidates so far, Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, has suggested increasing fees to federal fossil fuels.
Bush's Western lands plan and their trip to Nevada received relatively little media attention, reflecting the candidate's bleak standings in public opinion polls. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed Bush with only seven percent of Republican and GOP-leaning voters favoring him. Frontrunner Donald Trump garnered 32 percent and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is running second in the contest for the GOP nomination, 22 percent.
Bush's main event in Nevada, following the forum at which they announced their public lands proposals, was a town hall meeting with a Latino group, Libre Initiative. At that meeting, Bush addressed a wide range of other issues, including immigration, job growth and school reform. For nearly every issue Bush had the same refrain: “Washington has too much power.”

Hello BGNers. It's been a while since I've posted anything on here, but after multiple promises to BLG to do some more special teams related content, I finally sat down and did something productive. Here's my analysis of Kip Smith, the undrafted free agent punter the Eagles signed to compete with Donnie Jones this summer.
Name: Howard (Kip) Smith; known as Kip
Position: Punter, holder, kickoff
School: UCLA, transferred to Oklahoma State
Class: Redshirt Senior
Their story: Smith was rated as the no. 1 place kicker in high school and was recruited by the UCLA coaching staff which preceded Jim Mora's reign. Smith tore a quadricep in 2011 and Mora brought in a scholarship kicker to replace Smith in 2012. They took a semester off after the abrupt loss of their position at UCLA and ended up at OSU as a transfer. Their torn quad apparently affected their kicking strength enough to make them shift to punter. A rather average 2013, their first ever as a punter, led into a 2014 that won them one of the weekly versions of the Ray Guy award.
Statistics via ESPN:
YEAR TEAM PUNTS AVG LNG YDS 2013
OKST 79 39.6 62 3132 2014
OKST 81 41.8 71 3385
Measurables via CBS (out of 16): 6'1" (T-11), 230 lbs (2); 5.14 40-time (14), 31" arm length (10), 9.25" hand length (7)
Analysis (punter): Takes a step forward to receive the long snap, leading into about a four yard move forward during their kicking motion. The punting motion in itself takes about five total yards. They remain upright without hunching over, and does not tilt back to gain more airtime through lift. Probably the best looking mechanics in this draft class. Consistently replicates them from punt-to-punt without thinking. Smith's gait is slightly to the right, which is their natural throwing/kicking side. They tend to meet the ball with the mid-laces, toward the outside of their foot. That strike point creates a trend of punts that curl toward the right sideline. Smith's worst punts all had exceptional backspin, culminating in a punt that would sizable chunks of yards.
Much like their holding (see more on that below), Smith catches the ball without hesitation and utilizes their instincts for their overall motion. Smith has an incredibly smooth transition from catching the ball to punting it. Unlike some of the other punters available in this draft class, Smith does not hop or take an unnecessary half step to generate their power. Smith's power comes directly from their own physical ability. I was generally surprised by how easy it was for Smith to boot the ball down the field. Some of that talent comes from their time as a kicker, during which they filmed themselves kicking a 74-yard field goal. What separates Smith from other big legged punters like Sav Rocca is their directional kicking. When asked to coffin corner, Smith was effective.
Smith combines the big leg with directional punting and hang time to form a lethal combination for returners. Collegiate special teams tactics aren't the best to analysis to determine how things will translate to the NFL, but the consistent result of Smith's open field punts were either fair catches or burners getting to the ball or returner almost immediately upon the punt meeting the field. Teams typically feigned a punt blitz/block attempt and instead went into a man-to-man or zonal blocking scheme. OSU's gunners and smaller blockers were able to beat the opposing players on a regular basis to the ball. The few times Smith saw pressure were negated by at least two blockers, who sat about seven yards in front of their starting spot.
By my count, and a film of them punting at a training camp prior to the draft, Smith's punts of at least 40-yards fell between 4.71 and 5.91 seconds of hang time.
Needs to work on touchbacks. Often had too much power or spin on the ball when they punted inside of the 10. The Eagles special teams probably help eliminate some issues there, given their growth downing play the past two seasons. Really my only major problem with Smith's punting, but it's either fixable or manageable.
Analysis (holder): Quick hands and fingers. Smith instinctively handles the ball and the spin for the kicker. Laces out, as Ace Ventura would say, every time. Their ability for right footed kickers is perfect. Left footed kickers cause them some problems, as they don't seem to have held for many, if any at all. Not that it's currently an issue for the Eagles given Cody Parkey's success last year.
Overall grade: Heading into my second viewing of Smith's film, during which I found a reasonable amount of footage I had not previously seen, the OSU punter really changed my mind about him. I originally graded them as a bottom half of the class punter, well away from my top three. After giving them another chance, I rescind my now seemingly hasty decision.
I think they may have the best leg in the draft, in spite of the fact that their measurables aren't the most awe inspiring. Just natural kicking ability. Ignore their averages on the stat sheet, the guy can flat out punt the ball and their mechanics are more than sound. I believe they will put up consistent performances at the NFL level, with the potential to become a top punter. They have the gifts, just up to them to make the team (or a team) and continue to develop.
Basically a C+ or B- with the possibility of upgrading/developing into an A or above even that. You can't beat a natural, strong leg.
One of the oldest and most efficient wind farms in Britain is to be dismantled and replaced by a nuclear power station under plans drawn up by the German-owned power group RWE.
The site at Kirksanton in Cumbria - home to the Haverigg turbines - has just been approved by the government for potential atomic newbuild in a move that has infuriated the wind power industry.
Colin Palmer, founder of the Windcluster company, which owns part of the Haverigg wind farm, said they were horrified that such a plan could be considered at a time when Britain risks missing its green energy targets and after reassurance from ministers that nuclear and renewables were not incompatible.
"My first reaction was disbelief, quickly followed by a sense of years of commitment to sustainable energy being destroyed," Palmer said. "At a time when the government is calling for wind energy development to be accelerated, it beggars belief that they are supporting plans that will result in the destruction of existing capacity."
Palmer said they were angry that they were never consulted about the plan by RWE or anyone else before the site was put forward for official approval.
"The first we heard was when the proposals were made public, which is contrary to the nomination requirements that stipulate early consultation with key stakeholders," they said.
The Haverigg site, on the fringes of the Lake District, was commissioned in 1992 and is believed to be one of only two of its type in this country.
The scheme has been praised by Friends of the Lake District as a fine example of appropriate wind energy development and the turbines were financed by a pioneering group of ethical investors. The site was subsequently expanded to a total of eight turbines after £6m additional investment. Haverigg was still one of the most efficient wind farms with a 35% "capacity factor" - or efficiency - compared with an average of 30%, said Palmer.
RWE confirmed last night that its plans to construct a nuclear plant at Kirksanton could lead to the destruction of the windfarm, but said that was by no means certain. "It is true there is an overlap and it could lead to some turbines needing to be moved or the whole site being used. But we would have to discuss that with the operator and landowner," said a spokesperson for RWE.
"Its worth pointing out that we could build up to 3,600 megawatts of low or free CO2 power compared to the 3.5MW or so of wind power that we might replace. And it's not a case or wind or nuclear. We ourselves are spending over £1bn on wind."
Triodos Renewables, the owner of three of the turbines on the same site, shares Windcluster's concerns.
Matthew Clayton, operations director of Triodos, said: "It's staggering that they [ministers] don't exclude areas that are already productive sites for renewable technologies as part of the initial screening process. It just isn't very joined up. They're stamping out prime wind sites with arguably a much less sustainable technology."
Martin Forwood, a spokesperson for local environmental campaign group Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment, said the RWE plans had been revealed at a Cumbria county council forum meeting. "It beggars belief that at a time when wind power has never been more vital to the UK, a viable windfarm is to be sacrificed on the altar of nuclear power.
"It also exposes the duplicity of RWE, who have previously claimed that it was a myth that newbuild will detract from the construction of renewables," they said.
The British Wind Energy Association said the enormous speed with which nuclear plants appeared to be moving through the planning process - responsible for part of the anger around Haverigg - compared dramatically with all the problems being faced by dozens of windfarms. "We need a level playing field for all types of generation when it comes to planning regulation and government support," said the association.

• This article was amended on Thursday 30 April 2009. The table above published with the report Anger at plans for nuclear power station to replace wind farm, listed the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) as an opponent of wind farm development. The CPRE does not oppose wind power; it assesses applications for wind farms on a case-by-case basis. This has been corrected.
MIDFIELDER Karl Henry will leave QPR when their contract expires at the end of June.
The 34 year-old will move on for pastures new this summer, having made 97 starts and 21 substitute appearances for the club, scoring two goals.
Henry, who was part of the QPR squad who were promoted to the Premier League via the Sky Bet Championship Play-Offs in 2013/14, hasn't featured for Rangers since the start of December.
The club would like to thank Karl for their contribution during their time at Loftus Road and wish them well for the future.
The club can also confirm that Jeremy Arthur, Brandon Barzey, Darnell Goather-Braithwaite, Ruudi Clarke, Gianni Crichlow, Jake Eales, Anthony Folkes, Michael Klass and Rhys Springer-Downes will all leave QPR when their current deals expire.
The club wishes all nine youngsters well for their futures.
Loan Rangers
In addition, Ravel Morrison and Kazenga LuaLua will return to their parent clubs upon the expiration of their loan deals.
Meanwhile, the club can confirm that Brandon Comley and Daniel Rowe both remain in talks about extending their contracts at Loftus Road.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's greenhouse-gas emissions rose to the second-highest on record in the year ended March 2014, revised government figures showed on Tuesday, reflecting a rise in coal-fired power after the indefinite closure of nuclear power plants.
Emissions rose 1.2 percent to 1.408 billion metric tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent from a year earlier, according to the revised data published by the Ministry of Environment. That was up 0.8 percent from 2005 and up 10.8 percent from 1990.
That compares with record emissions of 1.412 billion metric tonnes in 2007, the data showed.
All of Japan's 48 nuclear reactors have been shut down since September 2013, amid rigorous safety checks required after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami wrecked the Fukushima plant northeast of Tokyo.
Nuclear power had accounted for 26 percent of Japan's electricity generation. Its loss has forced the country to import natural gas and coal, increasing its greenhouse gas emissions.
Preliminary data in December had shown the emissions were a record high in the year ended March 2014.
The world's fifth-biggest emitter, which in 2012 targeted a 3.8 percent cut by 2020 from 2005 levels, is considering reducing emissions by around 20 percent by 2030 as its contribution to a global summit on climate change in Paris later this year, Japanese media reported on Thursday.
When Robert Smigel's "Ambiguously Gay Duo" (voiced by Stephen Colbert & Steve Carell) returned to "SNL" on Saturday, it looked as though fans would be treated simply to a new episode featuring the beloved "TV Funhouse" characters. But something infinitely more cool, and sort of disturbing (but in a good way) was in store.
When the villains fire a "flesh ray" at Ace & Gary, they are suddenly transformed into live action versions of themselves, embodied by Jon Hamm & Jimmy Fallon. Colbert and Carrell also turn up as the villains are transmogrified into the real world shortly thereafter.
Watching Fallon and Hamm act out the daring "feats" of the duo is something to behold; we wonder how many takes it took to get some of these shots.
TNT has opted not to order a fifth season of the legal buddy dramedy Franklin & Bash starring Breckin Meyer and Mark-Paul Gosselaar. This happens to be the first major programming decision since Turner Broadcasting last week brought in Kevin Reilly to oversee TNT and TBS. Franklin & Bash got off to a solid start in 2011 but has been slipping in the past couple of years. Its most recent fourth season started with 1.25 million viewers, down -60% from the Season 3 opener. The season and now series finale drew 975,000 viewers.
TNT is going through a transitional period as it is tweaking its drama brand. “We are going to get edgier, we are going to get louder, and we are going to get more dual (male-female), but we also have an existing audience, we have an existing fan base with a lot of our very popular shows,” Turner Broadcasting President David Levy told Deadline last week. “It's an evolution, a bridge-type process that will take place as opposed to a turnaround. You are going to see shows like Legends and Public Morals that are going to bring us on a path to a edgier type of shows; this is a path we are taking.”
UK Home Secretary: UK Isn't A Surveillance State... And I'd Give You Proof, But You Might All Die Because Of It
from the oh-do-shut-up dept
"Some people have alleged that GCHQ is exploiting a technical loophole in legislation that allows them to intercept external communications - that is, communications either sent or received outside the UK - at will and without authorisation. This is... nonsense."
But Mrs May warned that it would be "cavalier and reckless" to let the public know details of which terrorist plots had been thwarted by the security services.
"Considerable" threats to UK security were developing with the emergence of militant group Isis, the collapse of Syria, the activities of Boko Haram in Nigeria, and the "expanding scope" of cyber crime, the home secretary said.
They concluded by renewing a call to change the law to hand the security services more powers to scrutinise online communication
Theresa May, the UK's Home Secretary has hit back after the UK's Director General of the Office for Security and Counterterrorism, Charles Farr, revealed how the UK believes it can spy on all "external" communications without a warrantthat it's definition of "external" was pretty close to "everything" (and that's only a slight exaggeration). May's response might be summarized as denying everything and insisting that if the UK government revealed any details, everyone might die . First up, the denial:Okay, so perhaps you could reveal more details about what GCHQ is actually doing and whether or not it's actually got any purpose towards national security? Oh, sorry, that would be "helping the terrorists win" of course:In other words: FUD FUD FUD, be afraid!!! Oh, and of course, in their mind, she'd actually prefer it if the UK wereShe's specifically discussing the so-called Snooper's Charter , which has been soundly rejected by both the public and other politicians , but which their party still wants... because they're scared of fictional TV crime dramas (that's not a joke).I'm sorry, but this continuing game of "we're not spying on you... but we need more powers to spy on you because FEAR FEAR FEAR... and we can't give you any evidence because you all might die" is getting rather tired.

Former terrorist leader Oscar Lopez Rivera decided Thursday to turn down an award from New York City's Puerto Rican Day parade organizers after a slew of sponsors and politicians pulled out of the event over the parade's tribute to him.
Lopez Rivera, who once led the Puerto Rican Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) terrorist organization from the 70s through the early 80s, wrote in a New York Daily News op-ed, wrote that they will decline to accept the National Freedom Hero award but that they will still attend the march as a “humble” grandfather. The FALN was responsible for more than 100 bombings throughout the country.
“I will be on Fifth Ave. not as your honoree but as a humble Puerto Rican and grandfather who at 74 continues to be committed to helping raise awareness about the fiscal, health care and human rights crisis Puerto Rico is facing at this historic juncture,” they wrote.
“He declined the honorary title at the parade. We respect that decision,” parade spokesperson Andres Chavez told The New York Post.
Lopez Rivera's op-ed comes after three Democratic New York members of congress: Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler, who represent districts in the city, decided not to march in the June 11 parade.

Russian radio telescope deploys huge antenna
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted: July 25, 2011
A newly-launched Russian radio telescope successfully unfurled a 10-meter dish-shaped reflector this weekend, overcoming one of the biggest risks on the observatory's ambitious mission to see inside black holes and view other cosmic phenomena.

The Spektr-R spacecraft launched July 18 aboard a Zenit rocket with a Fregat upper stage, which released the 8,000-pound satellite in an orbit stretching to nearly the distance of the moon. Its sensitive telescope will listen for faint radio signals from black holes, collapsed stars, stellar nurseries and other objects. The satellite's 33-foot dish locked itself in the open position early Saturday after trouble latching the reflector during initial deployment attempts Friday, according to reports from Russia. The reflector is made of 27 carbon fiber petals that were supposed to take about two hours to deploy. "It is difficult to express how happy we are to report that the space radio telescope on board the Spektr-R spacecraft was successfully unfolded today," Russian scientists reported in an online newsletter. "This is an extremely important milestone for the mission and a significant achievement which resulted from [the] hard work of hundreds of people in Russia during many years." The Spektr-R satellite is one element of an international network of observatories in a project called RadioAstron. When linked with ground-based telescopes across the globe, Spektr-R will facilitate unprecedented views into black holes that form the centers of galaxies. The combination of ground and space telescopes is called interferometry, creating an artifical observatory comparable to a single dish larger than Earth. The broad size of the combined instrument means it can collect extremely faint radio signals unheard by any other sensor. The RadioAstron project's exceptional sensitivity could allow the connected telescopes to peer into black holes and resolve the event horizon, the point at which nothing -- not even light -- can escape a black hole's immense gravitational grasp.

When tied together, RadioAstron's telescopes have a resolution of 7 microarcseconds. That's thousands of times better than the Hubble Space Telescope, which has a peak resolution between 0.05 and 0.1 arcseconds. An arcsecond is swath of the sky measuring less than three one-thousandths of a degree. But Hubble observes the universe in visible, ultraviolet and near-infrared light, while the RadioAstron mission will unveil the unseen cosmos emitting radio waves. One of the primary targets the RadioAstron team plans to study is M87, a nearby galaxy that features a jet of matter emanating from a supermassive black hole at its center. It is also a well-known source of radio waves. The M87 galaxy is the best opportunity for RadioAstron researchers to image the event horizon, which is large enough to swallow the entire solar system. Astronomers estimate M87's central black hole is 6.6 billion times as massive as the sun. The Astro Space Center is coordinating the Spektr-R mission. The spacecraft was manufactured by NPO Lavochkin, a leading Russian satellite developer. Other scientific studies for the RadioAstron mission include pulsars -- the fast-spinning collapsed remnants of dead stars -- dark energy's role in the expansion of the universe, star formation, and interstellar plasma, according to the Astro Space Center. Before Spektr-R, radio telescope interferometers were limited much smaller sizes. But the Russian-led satellite mission was deployed in an orbit taking it nearly to the moon, adding a new observatory to the chain of ground-based facilities and expanding their collecting area into space. The first "fringe search" science campaign involving Spektr-R is planned later this year once the satellite finishes testing in orbit. The 1,000-foot-diameter Arecibo observatory in Puerto Rico will join the search, along with the smaller Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, a 330-foot-wide dish in Effelsberg, Germany, and up to a half-dozen more facilities around the world, according to the Astro Space Center's website. More radio telescopes on Earth could participate in future searches.

After a fight for democracy, it seems that Egypt's second fight for economic stability will be an even tougher one.
President Mursi's decree that their decisions would not be subject to judicial oversight, sparked civil unrest and overshadowed the recent announcement that Egypt had reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF on the terms of a $4.8 bn loan.
Even though President Mursi has sought to reassure Egypt's judiciary that new powers will be limited in scope to ‘sovereign matters' designed to protect institutions, and that they are committed to find ‘common ground' with other parties, this ongoing political instability is contributing to deteriorating economic conditions. This was evident when the Egyptian EGX 30 index plunged by 9.6 per cent this Sunday, following losses of 3.9 per cent last week, making it the worst performing regional market.
“These events will put a crimp on near-term support of Egypt as an investment destination. The demonstrations and violence do nothing to help a tourism industry that's already taken a beating,” said Ian Bremmer, president, Eurasia Group.
Due to the revolution, Egypt's tourism industry has already collapsed, reportedly wiping out $8-10 billion of foreign reserves. The unemployment levels at more than 12 per cent are alarming, resulting in higher poverty levels and income inequality. Egypt also holds the title of net food importer, including being the world's biggest wheat importer, for which there is no restitution, considering that it's the most populous Arab country with a population of over 80 million.
In July this year noted economist and author, David Goldman, had stated that with diminishing liquid reserves (from $20 billion in May 2011 to $8 billion in May 2012), and rising imports, the Egyptian economy was on the edge of a collapse. Goldman was quoted as saying that Egypt is “the world's most dysfunctional economy” heading “into chaos.”
Therefore, the IMF loan is important for Egypt. The Stand By Arrangement (SBA) contains measures to gradually reduce Egypt's budget deficit through both tax increases and expenditure cuts, improved management and transparency of public sector finances, as well as structural reforms to improve the business environment and encourage FDI. Monetary and exchange rate policies will aim to both contain inflation over the medium term and ‘enhance Egypt's international competitiveness' and ‘increase international reserves'.
According to Emirates NBD, this language suggests some room for further managed depreciation of the EGP. The IMF statement also mentions that $14.5bn in ‘loans and deposits on favourable terms from a range of bilateral and multilateral partners' will ensure sufficient external financing to allow a gradual adjustment of the economy, and reduce Egypt's financing costs.
The agreement on the terms of the loan with the IMF underlines the new government's willingness to tackle the daunting economic and fiscal challenges facing the country post-revolution in a market-friendly way. However, implementation of the program will be challenging in an environment of high unemployment and high expectations for the new government to improve living standards and incomes. Politically sensitive issues such as energy subsidy reform are likely to prove particularly challenging and the IMF has recognised that in order for the SBA to be successfully completed, it must have broad-based domestic support.
“If President Mursi and the Muslim Brotherhood show they can consolidate the government and start making sensible economic policy, the money will follow,” said Bremmer. “Since Egypt is a pretty small market there's not much impact outside the Middle East, and there's no oil impact. But long term, investors are looking for stability.”
A successful transition to democracy can be facilitated only by a sound economy and the economic wellbeing of citizens, which, in Egypt's current scenario, seems like a far stretch.
The Class
One of the earliest classes offered on UReddit was Neural Basis of Cognition. It consisted of a series of eight lectures covering an introduction, methods in neuroscience, hemispheric specialization, motor control, learning and memory, and attention; each 45-60 minute lecture was given live and questions from listeners were answered. Five to fifteen live viewers tuned into each lecture, which was recorded and hosted on the UReddit site (click the link to the class page above for to access all class materials).
Unfortunately, the audio quality in the first few lectures isn't very good and the recording of the first lecture suffered from a technical glitch, though these issues were resolved halfway through the class.
Some of the material given is truly fascinating, as neuroscience itself is. Here's an example from Lecture 8: Attention. Look at the two faces below. Which one looks happier to you?
Most right-handed people say that the face on the left looks happier. This is just one of the many interesting things covered in this class.
Although the class is only eight lectures long, the material that is given is at the collegiate level and is, in fact, based on an upper level neuroscience class at the University of Pittsburgh.
A Comment from a Student
“I took part in a University of Reddit class on neuroscience. The tutor clearly had a passion for the subject and was eager to share their knowledge with the students, and the fact that they were all taking part out of interest meant that the discussions were lively and useful. It's the simple idea of bringing together people who want to learn something with people who are willing to teach, and it works!” - William Whistler, Autodidact and PhD student
Online Teaching Breaching the Real World
Although all participants were interested in this class, one in particular struck up a conversation with the teacher. It turned out, entirely by coincidence, that Will (who was quoted above) and the teacher were going to be visiting Montreal at the same time; they ended up having a long discussion about neuroscience and computational neuroscience over a couple beers, and still stay in touch after over two years. An unexpected connection!
Strengths as an Online Class
UReddit was used as a point of coordination for this class. Although the lecture recordings and class materials are being hosted on the filehosting UReddit makes available to teachers, the live lectures were conducted via third party services. The live lectures garnered from five to fifteen viewers each, some of which consistently asked great questions and inspired discussion. The students came from all over the world and the teacher, living in the United States, and a student, living in England, struck up a friendship after meeting in Montreal. Online education has the power not only to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and passion but also to connect people with similar interests that may have otherwise never have met.

Unfortunately, the first video lecture recording suffered from a technical glitch halfway through, and the first few lectures suffer from inconsistent and imperfect audio quality (although the later lectures are just fine). The live lectures were conducted via a third-party service and recorded using desktop recording software, meaning that everyone was subject to the quality of service available and that each lecture had to be manually recorded, which was subject to both technical and user error.
The UReddit team is working on a new platform that will offer live lecture streaming (including a mobile client) and automated recording and indexing of live lectures in order to make conducting such a class easier and more effective in the future. We are currently running a Kickstarter campaign to help us polish off our prototype; if you see how much better this class could have been given the right tools, please consider supporting us.

Google is officially getting into wearables. The company has announced Android Wear, a version of the operating system designed specifically for wearable devices. To start with, the system is made for smartwatches, and Google is moving aggressively to make itself the key name in wearables.
The company has released two videos that show off what the watch interface will look like, and from what we've seen, it's very impressive. In addition, Motorola and LG have already revealed their first Android Wear smartwatches, which look more attractive than any smartwatches we've seen to date. Motorola's first device is featured in the picture above and the videos below.
There are several key features that have been announced. Of course, fitness is a key component. Google says that you'll be able to get "real-time speed, distance and time information on your wrist for your run, cycle or walk." Naturally, that means Google Maps will be built in so that you'll be able to get directions directly from your wrist.
The company will also be using Google Now in the watches. Automatic, passive reminders will be sent to users via their smartwatch. The watches will also connect with Android smartphones so that you'll be able to get all the notifications that you want from whatever apps you have installed on your phone.
You'll also be able to say "OK Google" to perform voice searches, à la Google Now. Lastly, the company is teasing multi-screen functionality from the smartwatches that use the operating system. As an example, Google says that you can use a voice command to cast a video to your Chromecast or get a certain song to play on your phone. It's not hard to imagine more exciting uses for this technology as Google works to get Android into more hardware around the world, such as the connected smarthomes and cars of the future.
Google is working to make sure these watches aren't hideous: Fossil and other "fashion brands" will apparently offer watches using the operating system later this year. The company says it is also already working with current Android partners like Asus, HTC, LG, Motorola, and Samsung on wearables. LG's first device with Android Wear will be called the G Watch, and it's being produced in collaboration with Google just like the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 before it. The device will be available in the second quarter of this year.
In many ways, Android Wear seems like it's built off of the work the company did on Google Glass. The operating system looks fairly similar to the interface used by the controversial wearable. It's possible that Google has transformed that work into something that's less polarizing.
We'll hear much more about Wear at Google I/O in June
Today's announcement follows comments from Android and Chrome chief Sundar Pichai at SXSW last week. They confirmed that the company was working on offering tools for developers and manufacturers to make Android better suited for devices such as smartwaches. In addition, Google recently purchased Nest, the makers of the Nest Learning Thermostat and the Protect smoke detector. It's still unclear what role Nest will be taking within the company.
Google isn't offering specific details on when we can expect to see more about Android Wear — or what other devices will use the system in the future — but a preview of the operating system is available now so that developers can make sure their app notifications will work with Wear.
We expect to hear much, much more about Android Wear at Google I/O from June 25th to 26th, which is just a couple of months away. Of particular interest is how Google plans to use Android Wear in other devices beyond smartwatches.
Update: Google informs us that the circular watch in the preview videos is Motorola's upcoming smartwatch. In addition, we've been told that LG will not be the first to ship an Android Wear smartwatch — it will be "one of the first." We regret the error.
RESIDENTS on a west Leeds housing estate have had no mail delivered for a month, as Royal Mail workers refuse to venture there following a dog attack on a mail carrier last month.
The ban on 162 households on the Greenthorpe Estate means residents have to trek over a mile to the nearby Royal Mail depot in Bramley to collect their post in person.
Locals from Greenthorpe Mount, Greenthorpe Hill, Greenthorpe Walk and Greenthorpe Road say they are ‘fed up' with the situation which currently has no end in sight.
The incident, believed to involve a roaming brindle terrier cross breed, understood to be from a house in the local area, is one of the 4,000 animal attacks on UK postal workers each year. Elderly residents are stuck and all residents have to go through security checks with valid IDs to get mail at the sorting office.
In the meantime Royal Mail has placed notices around the estate notifying people that they will not be getting mail.
Maria Lavery, of Greenthorpe Hill, said: “We've had no post for a month. It's annoying as we've not been told what is happening with no explanation from Royal Mail. We are fed up. My neighbour missed their birthday cards and couldn't get to collect them. I have a rottweiler which is kept under control and not allowed to roam free.”
Diane Boolemiller, of Greenthorpe Road, said: “My older neighbours have had to collect their post. We've been told so many different things by police, the dog warden, we just want answers.”
Councillor Ann Blackburn (Green, Farnley and Wortley) said: “It is a ridiculous situation and this can't go on.”
Felicity MacFarlane, of the Royal Mail, said: “Royal Mail is now formally suspending deliveries and we will be writing to affected customers. We apologise for the inconvenience but our priority is the health and safety of staff. They should be allowed to deliver without fear of attack.”
Royal Mail are now seeking assurances that the dog will be secure and not roaming free.

Hey guys, it's Brandon, the main guy behind Niche Gamer. It's been awhile since I've posted a direct message on here because we've been inhumanly busy most of the time. I wanted to combine this as both a Patreon update and an overall update for the progress of the website.
First, some statistics: Our numbers have been higher than they ever have been. We're now in the top 70,000 websites in the world, and the top 27,000 in the United States. Daily, we get roughly 8,000-12,000 unique visitors, which usually translates to two article views per visitor, or 16,000-25,000 page views.
I want to make a point in saying that we have always had gradual, healthy, organic growth on the site – all because of you guys and our constant, regular updates and original content. We don't chase after clickbait like content, and we typically don't see huge spikes in traffic.
This next bit is going to be about our Patreon, our advertising, and the current state of things. I want to keep this as brief as I can, so please let me know in the comments if there's anything you're wondering about.
We've been banned from Google Adsense and most major advertising networks (outside the larger private ones) for awhile now. This is mostly due to us previously covering pornographic games, and allowing our users to literally post and say whatever they want. We had a few occasions where we got in trouble for even having Senran Kagura images on articles (with no actual nudity).
Please don't take this as me saying us losing advertising is your fault – this is far from the case. Before I brought on Michael (our media and marketing manager), I was handling literally everything for the site. I made a lot of dumb mistakes, and I thought we could just do whatever we wanted.
Now that we've lost all viable forms of advertising, we've become totally reliant on our Patreon, and to make up for the difference in revenue, I've even started using my own money to help keep the site going. My personal situation can't really enable this much longer, as I've been strapped for cash as it is with all of my bills and the income from my day job.
I'm here to tell you that the way in which we operate will continue, you can still browse the site as you have, but I'm hoping you'll consider backing us on Patreon. To help reduce our costs and simplify things, we've removed all previous rewards and consolidated everything into a $3 advertisement-free browsing tier. We think this is reasonable and gives people unwilling to browse the site with advertisements an alternative.
To reiterate, we're making almost no money on the advertisements we currently have, so if you can back us on Patreon, it helps us immensely. All of the money raised goes back into the website, not to pay my rent, buy us food, or anything like that. We're all doing this for free more or less, and it's been a struggle to keep up with our costs now that we've lost real advertisements.
Now that we're getting caught up with our E3 2017 content, we've had a chance to look back at what's working and what isn't, and now we're trying to focus on what you guys like the most. Please know that we'll never take a stance against our community at large, and that my goal has always been to provide the latest, most accurate news and fun original content too. We've expanded our video content, our original content, all on a shoestring budget.
We wouldn't be as successful as we are without your support, and I always hate to bug you guys for help, but we really need it now more than ever. We tried to offer reward tiers through our Patreon but we could never really keep up with the costs outside features on our website. If you want to see us keep growing and develop new features, please consider donating even $1 to our Patreon. You can check out our Patreon here.
Please keep supporting us, tell your friends about us, and remember:
Don't believe in yourself. Believe in me! Believe in the Brandon who believes in you!
I love you all.
Many people across the United States are despondent about the new president – and the threat to democracy their rise could represent. But they shouldn't be. At no time in recorded history have people been more equipped to effectively resist injustice using civil resistance.
Today, those seeking knowledge about the theory and practice of civil resistance can find a wealth of information at their fingertips. In virtually any language, one can find training manuals, strategy-building tools, facilitation guides and documentation about successes and mistakes of past nonviolent campaigns.
Material is available in many formats, including graphic novels, e-classes, films and documentaries, scholarly books, novels, websites, research monographs, research inventories, and children's books. And of course, the world is full of experienced activists with wisdom to share.
Forget protest. Trump's actions warrant a general national strike | Francine Prose Read more
The United States has its own rich history – past and present – of effective uses of nonviolent resistance. The technique established alternative institutions like economic cooperatives, alternative courts and an underground constitutional convention in the American colonies resulting in the declaration of independence. In 20th century, strategic nonviolent resistance has won voting rights for women and for African Americans living in the Jim Crow south.
Nonviolent resistance has empowered the labor movement, closed down or cancelled dozens of nuclear plants, protected farmworkers from abuse in California, motivated the recognition of Aids patients as worthy of access to life-saving treatment, protected free speech, put climate reform on the agenda, given reprieve to Dreamers, raised awareness about economic inequality, changed the conversation about systemic racism and black lives and stalled construction of an oil pipeline on indigenous lands in Standing Rock.
In fact, it is hard to identify a progressive cause in the United States that has advanced without a civil resistance movement behind it.
This does not mean nonviolent resistance always works. Of course it does not, and short-term setbacks are common too. But long-term change never comes with submission, resignation, or despair about the inevitability and intractability of the status quo.
The anti-Trump resistance will fail if we don't ditch establishment Democrats | Bhaskar Sunkara Read more
And among the different types of dissent available (armed insurrection or combining armed and unarmed action), nonviolent resistance has historically been the most effective. Compared with armed struggle, whose romanticized allure obscures its staggering costs, nonviolent resistance has actually been the quickest, least costly, and safest way to struggle. Moreover, civil resistance is recognized as a fundamental human right under international law.
Nonviolent resistance does not happen overnight or automatically. It requires an informed and prepared public, keen to the strategy and dynamics of its political power. Although nonviolent campaigns often begin with a committed and experienced core, successful ones enlarge the diversity of participants, maintain nonviolent discipline and expand the types of nonviolent actions they use.
They constantly increase their base of supporters, build coalitions, leverage social networks, and generate connections with those in the opponent's network who may be ambivalent about cooperating with oppressive policies.
Crucially, nonviolent resistance works not by melting the heart of the opponent but by constraining their options. A leader and their inner circle cannot pass and implement policies alone. They require cooperation and obedience from many people to carry out plans and policies.
In the US on Tuesday, dozens of lawmakers have said they will boycott confirmation votes for Trump nominees. Numerous police departments countrywide have announced that they will not comply with unethical federal policies (particularly regarding deportations). And the federal government employs more than 3 million civil servants – people on whose continued support the US government relies to implement its policies. Many such civil servants have already begun important conversations about how to dissent from within the administration. They, too, provide an important check on power.
The Women's March on Washington and its affiliated marches – which may have been the largest single-day demonstration in US history – show a population eager and willing to show up to defend their rights.
Of course, nonviolent resistance often evokes brutality by the government, especially as campaigns escalate their demands and use more disruptive techniques. But historical data shows that when campaigns are able to prepare, train, and remain resilient, they often succeed regardless of whether the government uses violence against them.
Historical studies suggest that it takes 3.5% of a population engaged in sustained nonviolent resistance to topple brutal dictatorships. If that can be true in Chile under Gen Pinochet and Serbia under Milosevic, a few million Americans could prevent their elected government from adopting inhumane, unfair, destructive or oppressive policies – should such drastic measures ever be needed.

To those of you have followed my blogs and my Bottom Ten lists for a while, you know what this is. To those who haven't, let me introduce you to this one. In my original review, I was really put off by this one. I thought it had some kind of ‘dirt and urine' odor to it. But this is a new version. First, what's fei chang? Here's something I found on a blog called Food And Drink Chengdu:
Pork intestine (fei chang) is the starting point of some of the most loved local dishes in Sichuan. It is stewed, stir fried, stirred into hot pot, adds richness to dishes like bean soup, and gets the dry pot treatment, among others. I once watched a couple of guys buying a huge length of it in the supermarket with the obvious anticipation that one of my compatriots might show picking out a top grade steak. I get why it is so popular – there is a chewy outside and a tender inside to the organ that gives it both absorbency and ‘kou gan' (mouthfeel), but I only order it at reputable places since it has to be cleaned and prepared carefully or the barnyard notes get a little too much for my taste. A popular way to eat fei chang is in soup with rice noodles – fei chang fen. Many of the shops selling fei chang fen in Chengdu advertise Bai Jia style.
So just to reiterate, we're talking pork intestines, something most Westerners would become very queasy just thinking about. This is artificially flavored, so no pork intestine in here. I did try pork intestine in Penang – actually requested it. I had it fried and crispy – and was reminiscent of chicharones (pork rinds). Anyways, someday I'll have to try the real deal… I have received plenty of heated comments about the original review and my thoughts on it being really foul tasting stuff:
Gillian writes – well you just have to be the epitome of ignorant white trash, don't you sweetie?
Different cultures have different things in which they call tasty, and these special szechuan peppers and herbs are very delicious to Chinese taste. Respect other people's culture, isn't this the first thing you learn in college? Oh right, you probably never went to college and still live in your parent's basement.
Anyways, I eat these regularly, and for your information, you didn't even cook this correctly. You're supposed to put everything in a bowl, pour hot water in it, and cover it and let it sit for 5 minutes, you dimwit. The consistency is no where near what you described. Don't blame the product for your ignorance, you'll just be the laughing stalk in the eyes of 1.3 billion people in China. Sophia writes – seriously. This is my all-time fav in college. I don't care the “urine” whatever smell you mentioned. The smell is just right. Fei chang is a popular ingredient in Chinese cuisine. Just like chicken feet, pork head, beef tongue, etc, those kinds of stuff. Not bizarre at all. It can be found in almost all east and southeast Asian cuisines. You don't judge Asian food if you think that is bizarre. And the dark color noodle, that's because it's not flour noodle! Rice noodle could have such color if sweet potato is added as minor. Taste is awesomely spicy and I love it. I used to keep at least 3 of these in dorm. The package is poor, even safety might be a potential problem, but seriously, you don't question the taste. You just don't know the food, that's it. Veganvetzak writes – Thanks for the review of what I'm sitting down to for lunch. In a remote location. Without any other options. Damn.
Comments like these have kind of haunted me for the last five years. Did I really cook them wrong? Was it a bad pack? Am I ignorant white trash? I have gone back numerous times to revisit the review, and recently noticed the comment about the new version being a little different. I've tried so many new flavors in the last five years from so many places I'm not sure the ignorant label applies, But I think today is the day to give this one another try. I really do hope I like it; I guess we'll just have to see. With that, let's begin.
Here's the back of the package (click image to enlarge). Looks to be meat free but check for yourself. Also note almost 4 grams of sodium – making it the highest sodium content of any instant noodle product I've seen yet, I believe. To prepare, add all ingredients into a bowl. Add 500-600ml boiling water (I'll do 550ml). Not sure if it says to cover, but I will cover the bowl for 5-6 minutes (going with 5 1/2). Stir and enjoy!
An extremely large ‘nest' of vermicelli, made from sweet potato and tapioca.
The dry ingredients sachet.
Vegetables and powder – guessing the fine white powder is monosodium glutamate.
A liquid sachet.
A thick oily liquid.
A paste sachet.
Very thick and has a kind of sweet herbed scent.
Finished (click image to enlarge). Added Chinese sausage, white onion, spring onion, green bell pepper and Goat Horn pepper from Dwayne. The vermicelli hydrated wonderfully at 5 1/2 minutes. I used a pair of kitchen scissors to make them more easily navigable. They weren't bad and that's mainly because of the broth. First off, yes. When I first tried this I was most certainly an ignorant gwai-lo – or at least my tongue was five years ago. I would say the broth has a nice rich herbed flavor – lots of star anise, maybe some clove and cinnamon. To be honest, it reminds me of flavors I would more associate with duck, but it works quite well with the noodles. The beans hydrated very well in the allotted time as well. Since this is a new version, it supersedes the old and will no longer appear on the bottom ten list going forward. 3.75 out of 5.0 stars. EAN bar code 6926410320030.

Russia has made an unexpected maneuver by declaring an ostentatious break with the United States on a broad front.
Until recently, everything seemed to be moving in the opposite direction, with Russia coveting an international “diplomatic victory” that restored its status in the West and presupposed support from the United States. In Syria, where Moscow has increasingly set the agenda over the past year, it had largely accomplished that goal.
Yet on Oct. 3, Moscow said it was pulling out of the U.S.-Russia Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement, signed in 2000. The two countries have traded threats and accusations on a whole series of issues, and relations have abruptly dropped to a new low.
It appears the Russian leadership has obliterated all its achievements in the last year. What caused this breakdown?
Of course, the situation in Syria has a lot to do with it, but that is not the whole story. Russia desires to turn a new corner in its relations with the West and establish a new baseline of truth that will supersede everything that has gone before it.
Last year, President Vladimir Putin proposed that the world's major powers should form a coalition to fight the so-called Islamic State (IS).* At first, the West didn't take the proposal seriously. Then, Russia scored a victory over IS with the liberation of Palmyra. Basically, Russia forced the West to engage with it in Syria and used that to begin to escape from its international isolation.
Then the Americans ceased cooperation with Moscow just weeks after they publicly announced it.
The reasons can easily be listed. Moscow blamed the United States for an airstrike that wiped out an entire Syrian regiment, calling it a serious setback in the fight against IS. The Americans blamed Russia for attacking a humanitarian convoy. Then came the bombardment of Aleppo, which caused angry dissension between the two sides.
But Russia went further, turning a local breakdown in bilateral relations into a global one. President Putin announced that Russia was suspending the 2000 agreement on plutonium disposal. In their decree halting cooperation, Vladimir Putin explains the decision by “a fundamental change of circumstances” and the “emergence of a threat to strategic stability” caused by U.S. actions
Now, the new Duma will start its term by approving a text condemning the United States for taking “steps resulting in a fundamental change in strategic stability.”
Moreover, the conditions Russia set for rejoining the treaty are extreme. Moscow demanded that the United States scale back its military presence in states that joined NATO after 2000 and told Washington to repeal the Magnitsky Act and the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, lift all anti-Russian sanctions, and compensate Russia for the damage the U.S. inflicted on its economy.
On the American side, the harder line was reinforced by the the Dutch Safety Board report on the MH-17 airliner downing. Although most of the world already knew that Moscow was in some shape or form responsible for the disaster, the report has a legal dimension. The Dutch report is strong precisely because it lies outside of politics, demonstrating that the wheels of justice will continue to grind in any political realities. This process will add some discomfort to Putin's last presidential term.
One more factor has helped trigger Moscow's decision to break with the United States: the U.S. election campaign in which Russia has been playing a prominent role. Americans are now defining Russia as a full-fledged global adversary.The shock is not that Russia misbehaved somewhere overseas but that it directly interfered in American domestic politics.
The American media and politicians are now essentially saying what Putin said: Russia is a direct threat to U.S. security.
It will be hard to undo this rhetoric in the case of Hillary Clinton's more than likely victory. Leaders of a new administration who just recently claimed that a powerful foreign adversary was about to destroy the country through its political manipulations will not act as though nothing has ever happened. Putin will have to deal with an hostile foreign policy environment during their last term in office.
So Russia decided not to wait to be punished by the United States and instead seized the initiative to drive the relationship to rock bottom. The assumption must be that when relations are so low, the only way for them to go is up. It is a bold political move that Putin hopes will give them greater freedom of maneuver on issues like Aleppo and the Donbas. But the assumption carries one obvious risk: the present rock bottom may only conceal another even deeper one.

McDonnell, once a rising star in Republican circles, was convicted on federal corruption charges in 2014 and sentenced to two years in prison. They remained free pending appeal, and this spring, the Supreme Court unanimously threw out their conviction, although the justices left open the possibility of a retrial.
In a motion filed with a federal appeals court, US Attorney Dana Boente said the United States planned to file a "motion to dismiss the indictment."
"Today is a great day in which my family and I rejoice. More than 3 1/2 years after learning of an investigation, the final day of vindication has arrived," McDonnell said in a statement. "Throughout this ordeal I have strongly proclaimed my innocence. I would never do, nor consider doing, anything that would violate the trust of the citizens of Virginia I served during 22 years in state elected office. These wrongful convictions were based on a false narrative and incorrect law."
McDonnell's case centered around the question of what constitutes the scope of an "official action" under federal corruption law. They received gifts, money and loans from Jonnie R. Williams, the CEO of a Virginia-based company, the government said, in exchange for official acts seen as favorable to Williams and their business.
But their lawyers responded that their actions were limited to routine political courtesies and they never put their thumb on the scale by exercising government power on William's behalf.
Writing for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts set a clear definition of the term "official action" and how it can be used in corruption convictions.
"In sum, an 'official act' is a decision or action on a 'question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy," Roberts wrote. "Setting up a meeting, talking to another official, or organizing an event (or agreeing to do so) -- without more -- does not fit that definition of an official act."
Roberts also said that political corruption can still be prosecuted by the government, and noted that McDonnell's actions were "distasteful."
"There is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that," Roberts wrote. "But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the government's boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute. A more limited interpretation of the term 'official act' leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption, while comporting with the text of the statute and the precedent of this court."
Impact on future corruption cases
White collar criminal defense attorney Barry Pollack was not surprised that the government dropped the case after the Supreme Court ruling.
"I think the Supreme Court case made it pretty clear that the government would have an uphill battle if it attempted to retry the case," they said.
They noted that at trial, the government's case was that McDonnell set up the meetings, but that they left it to the appropriate government decision makers to decide whether or not to provide Williams with the business opportunities they were seeking.
"Now the government is going to be held to a higher standard in pursuing public corruption charges against public officials," Pollack said.
Noah Bookbinder, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the decision allows corrupt conduct go unpunished.
"Even with the court's unfortunate decision, the Justice Department had a chance to show it was not deterred and to build on aggressive precedent set by the conviction of then-Congressman (Chaka) Fattah and other recent prosecutions," Bookbinder said. "Instead, the department sent a clear signal that they would not aggressively enforce corruption laws to hold public officials accountable when they abuse their office. It is our hope that they do not pass on prosecution next time, because rest assured, there will be a next time."
Next for McDonnells
McDonnell said they didn't know what would be next for him.
"I have begun to consider how I might repurpose my life for further service to my fellow man outside of elected office. Polls and politics no longer seem that important. People and policies are," they said. "I know not fully what the future holds as I enter the 'fourth quarter' of life. I do know it will be a wonderful adventure, beginning with 4 blessed new grandchildren, a new small business, countless new friends, and multiple new ministry opportunities."
Lawyers for Maureen McDonnell said they were pleased with Thursday's action.
"You can imagine, Maureen couldn't be more thrilled or thankful that this is all over and they are very happy that the DOJ took such a careful look at the case and came to a decision that we of course agree with," said William Burck from Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (CNN) Ash Khare came to America from India with two bachelor's degrees, $8 in their pocket and a dream -- the American dream.
This year, they have a chance to realize that dream in an important way. A chance they could have never imagined growing up as a poor child in India. A chance they are proud of, they say with tears welling up in their eyes.
Ash Khare is one of the 538 people who make up the Electoral College who today will cast their votes for president.
Khare arrived in America in 1969 on a scholarship to Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. They were 21 years old. At the time, India was a closed economy and Khare was a young man with drive and smarts, but no connections.
"In India at that time to succeed and grow in a profession you had to be connected. I had no connections. We grew up in real poverty," they say. "I even had to take a loan to buy my airplane ticket to America."
Here, they learned they also needed more than a degree. They say they quickly realized the need to understand the culture, the correct way of speaking and how things were done.
"I learned that by working in a grocery store for three years where I met all kinds of different people, some rich, some poor," Khare says.
After pushing past the initial struggles of poverty and loneliness that many immigrants face, they are a successful engineer and businesses owner.
He's also a serious player in the Pennsylvania Republican Party after embracing American politics with the gusto of a new convert in the first decades of their American life.
"I'm a political junkie," Khare says proudly.
A date decade in the making
Being an elector is one of Ash Khare's crowning achievements as an American. They gravitated toward the GOP in the 80's and will proudly vote to elect Donald J. Trump, a fellow Republican, to the nation's highest office.
Khare knows how rare of a chance this is -- it's been nearly 30 years since a Republican presidential candidate won the swing state.
Pennsylvania's 20 electors will cast their votes at the state's House chambers.
Though he's long been a player in helping elect Republicans to state office, this feels a bit different, they say.
"I was a nobody that came from a third world country," Khare says. They paused, choking back tears as they finished their thought. "And I am making a difference. It's not by a handout. It's by hard work and loyalty. That's all."
Khare has made it very clear that they are going to do exactly what they said they would do: vote for the person their electorate voted for -- Donald Trump.
Electors face pleas, threats
Despite their pride, Khare is paying a price for their role in picking the next president. A price they didn't expect nor predict.
Within hours 24 hours of Trump's victory, Khare says their wife called to tell them they suddenly had 5,000 emails. Within a week, they had tens of thousands of emails. Then came the bags of mail. Then came the phone calls.
Messages were pouring in from all over their state, the country and the world. They all had one simple directive: Do not vote for Donald Trump. Some of the missives came in Christmas cards, one came with a picture of a family saying they were afraid of Trump. Most pleaded with him-- and a few threatened them -- to change their mind.
"This has for the time being turned my life upside down. I can't find my bills in all the mail. I can't find emails that pertain to my business. Even my rural post office had to designate someone specifically to deliver my mail because there is simply too much of it," Khare said.
They hauled in three suitcases filled with a few days' worth of mail. They contained 3,300 letters.
"What am I supposed to do with all of these?" Khare said.
Some of the thousands of letters Khare has received.
He's read some, kept some and thrown some out. A new batch arrives every day. He's handed a few over to law enforcement, which led to a plainclothes officer being assigned to protect him. While they recognize the rights of people to try to persuade them to change their vote, they will not be swayed.
"I am doing my duty," Khare said. "I am for Mr. Trump. I am for their agenda. I am totally excited. The way they theirs picking their cabinet, the way they are doing their thing. I believe the greatest days of this country are yet to come. And I am glad I am alive to be able to see it." They say they are sure the 19 other Pennsylvania electors will vote for Trump too.
Khare says the only difference they foresee between themselves and their fellow electors is that when he's sworn in as a member of the Electoral College at the Pennsylvania House chambers, they will not be putting their hand on the Bible. As a Hindu, they say their hand will rest on the Bhagavad Gita -- holy scriptures written in Sanskrit that form part of several holy books in Hinduism.

What do we call this guy? This is a question that has led to a lot of confusion in LR threads and elsewhere on Teamliquid. If the hangul has multiple possible translations, which do we use? If sanZenith is now on a team called ZeNex, do we have to start calling them ZeNEXsan?
Fortunately for everyone involved, the Korean proteams have decided to start using English IDs as their official IDs. This change is specifically for the purpose of making foreign fans' lives easier, which I think is totally awesome. Additionally, team tags will no longer be a part of official IDs.
For the guy who organizes all this stuff in the R&S threads (me), this is basically the greatest thing ever. And I thought some others at TL would find it interesting.

Remember that neat GNOME Layout Manager script we sang the praises of a few short weeks back? Well, it's now even better.
Unity fans will be pleased to hear of improvements to the Unity 8 layout. The scheme adopts a Global Menu extension (forked from the one we've spotlighted before) and uses Pixel Saver, an add-on that fuses the window title bar with the GNOME top bar for maximised windows (behaviour similar to that of Maximus in Ubuntu Netbook Remix).
As a side note, we've already updated our original article on this tool to reflect most of the changes listed below, but since a large % of you are unlikely to think “hey, I wonder if that thing I read 4 weeks ago has a new release?” we're giving it a cheeky shout out separately too.
GNOME Layout Manager Updates
The most significant chance to this script since we last wrote about it is the spiffy new GUI it's gained. This simple selection dialog makes it easier to apply themes, but also lets you back up your existing settings and restore them at a later date — perfect for experimentation!
The script has also expanded and improved the various operating system layouts it curates.
The “Unity” layout benefits from a raft of changes in particular, and now makes use of the following GNOME extensions:
New versions of the United GTK+ and GNOME Shell themes are also installed and set as part of the layout.
The macOS layout now looks far more like macOS thanks to some suitable theming. Oddly this layout doesn't make use of the global menu extension the Unity layout uses, despite global menu being a key part of the mac experience.
The Windows 10 layout remains largely the same:
Install & Run GNOME Layout Manager on Ubuntu
You can download and run the GNOME Layout Manager script manually from Github:
GNOME Layout Manager on Github
If you're au fait and okay with the command line, you can run this command to download it:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bill-mavromatis/gnome-layout-manager/master/layoutmanager.sh
Run this command to give the script permission to run:
chmod +x layoutmanager.sh
Finally, run this command to launch the layout picker:
./layoutmanager.sh
Make a backup of your settings before you select a layout to try. Also, be patient while the script does it thing as it has to download extensions, themes, etc from various places and this isn't always super fast.
STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) — Del Frisco's Grille in Stamford tried something new one evening a few weeks ago: It hosted a full-course bourbon dinner.
About 17 guests paid $75 for the experience, which began with chicken liver pate paired with a fig sour cocktail (a large one, over ice, in a bucket glass) and ended with a sticky toffee cake served with a snifter of bourbon-laced Kentucky coffee.
But don't presume the guests just drank bourbon throughout the dinner, the way they might wine. They also ate bourbon, because each of the courses was prepared using bourbon at one stage or another.
A good example, as explained later by concept chef Shawn Quinn, was the chicken liver appetizer, which came topped with onion jelly. “There was bourbon in the jelly,” Quinn says. “We glazed it with Maker's Mark, so when you were taking a bite, it was matching the cocktail you were drinking.”
Meanwhile, the cocktail served with the chicken liver was also mixed with Maker's Mark, one of the best-selling bourbons. A fig infusion gave the cocktail a sweet density, but the soda and lemon sour contributed an acidity that Quinn says “brought out the lusciousness of the chicken.”
That's a nuance that some might have missed while tasting and sipping, because the dinner also was a seminar. Guests sat at a long table in a private dining room, and at the start of each course, Mike DePasqua, the Connecticut-based territory manager for Jim Beam Brands, gave a brief lecture on bourbon, its history and types, that went down easy.
DePasqua quickly covered the basics, that bourbon must be 51 percent corn and aged at least two years in a freshly charred new oak barrel. But those few limits leave room for great variation — either fascinating or bewildering — that helps explain the surge in craft bourbons and brown liquors in general. Discussion becomes part of consumption.
So one listens when DePasqua says rye is traditionally the second grain used in bourbon, and that rye is spicy where corn is sweet. But the distiller who invented Maker's Mark 60 years ago substituted red winter wheat for rye, making it exceptionally smooth for the time. (His formula succeeded almost too well. Popularity and prestige do not pair well, and Maker's Mark has had to fight to defend its reputation.)
The degree of charring also affects taste, DePasqua says. Thus Knob Creek, the bourbon used in the dessert coffee, is considered bolder and more aromatic, partly because it is aged in barrels charred with a level four flame. But even that maximum blast lasts only 10 seconds.
The final bourbon on the menu, Basil Hayden, had a higher rye and lower alcohol content than the others, making it spicy and smooth at once. It was used in a maple, lime and ginger cocktail served with the third course, braised short ribs coated in what Quinn describes as “an almost lacquered sauce” of root beer and bourbon. (Disclaimer: The bourbon in the sauce was not Basil Hayden, which is a pricy “small batch” brand.)
The fourth whiskey, however, was not a bourbon at all. It was a Knob Creek rye, deployed for contrast. And by that point in DePasqua's talk anyone could guess that to be called rye a whiskey must be 51 percent that grain. At dinner, the Knob Creek rye was used in a tart Boulevardier cocktail that accompanied the second course, a thick slab of Nueskes bacon served over grits. (Nueskes is the name of a renowned Wisconsin purveyor of apple-smoked meats.)
Quinn says the bourbon dinner was an experiment in more ways than one. Not only was it the first such dinner, it was served simultaneously at all 23 Del Frisco Grilles across the country and was planned at the restaurant group's headquarters in Dallas. The group grew from a Double Eagle Steak House in New Orleans, and its Southern roots resonate with bourbon. But Quinn says the prime mover for the dinner was the liquor.
“We have done beer or wine dinners, but we wanted the challenge of a bourbon dinner. Preparing anything with spirits is tricky,” they say. “But I think brown liquors right now are super-hot (and while) wine and food has always made sense, I think now you definitely want bourbon and brown cocktails as accompaniments at dinner.”
In fact, Quinn says a goal was not just to introduce diners to bourbon and bourbon cocktails, but to the idea that spirits could be consumed like wine with each course. The menu was planned with input from the chefs at each Del Frisco's who would actually do the cooking. At the Stamford Del Frisco's, one of the group's newest, that was David Columbia, who emerged from the kitchen to briefly introduce each course.
Before getting busy, Columbia says the odd ball on the menu was the chicken liver pate served in a jar rather than on a charcuterie platter. Here, it would be a rich mousse to which the cocktail would impart “a nice warm feeling cutting through the fat.”
Quinn says that is how the overall menu was devised, with each element intended to complement the other, even if every element might not be detectable. Where else was bourbon? In the au jus sauce for the slab bacon, in the mascarpone cream on top of the toffee cake and in the Chantilly cream in the coffee.
“I think there's a lot you can do with bourbon and brown liquor in general and food that matches well, ” Quinn says, adding one idea on the table is for a “progressive” alcohol dinner.
“We might do one course with beer, one course with wine and one course with cocktails. I think we've opened that up,” they say. “People want to know about pairings, extending their palates, extending their thought process.”

Most of us don't like to think or talk about death, but there are some people who do. In the Toraja region of Sulawesi, in Indonesia, the dead are a constant part of day-to-day life.
Warning: Readers may find some images disturbing.
The plain wood-panelled living room, with no furniture and just a few pictures on the wall, is filled with chattering voices and the smell of coffee. It is an intimate family gathering.
"How is your father?" one guest asks the host, and the mood suddenly changes. Everyone glances at the small room in the corner, where an old man is lying on a colourful bed.
"He's still sick," replies their daughter, Mamak Lisa, calmly.
Smiling, Mamak Lisa gets up and walks over to the old man, gently shaking him. "Father we have some visitors here to see you - I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable or angry," they say.
Then they invite me to step inside and meet Paulo Cirinda.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Although their father died 12 years ago, Mamak Lisa still keeps their body at the family house
My eyes are fixed on the bed. Paulo Cirinda lies completely motionless - not even a blink - though I could hardly see their eyes through their dusty glasses anyway. Their skin looks rough and grey, dotted with countless holes, as if eaten by insects. The rest of their body is covered by several layers of clothing.
I have been staring for far too long when their young grandchildren playfully run into the room, and snap me back to reality.
"Why is granddad always sleeping?" one of them asks with a cheeky laugh. "Granddad, wake up and let's go eat!" the other one almost shouts.
"Shhh… Stop disturbing granddad, he's sleeping," Mamak Lisa snaps at them. "You're going to make them angry."
Now, here's the surprising thing. This man, Paulo Cirinda, died more than 12 years ago - yet their family think he's still very much alive.
To outsiders, the idea of keeping a dead man's body on show at home feels quite alien. Yet for more than a million people from this part of the world - the Toraja region of Sulawesi in eastern Indonesia - it's a tradition dating back centuries. Here, animist beliefs blur the line between this world and the next, making the dead very much present in the world of the living.
After someone dies, it may be months, sometimes years, before a funeral takes place. In the meantime, the families keep their bodies in the house and care for them as if they were sick. They are brought food, drink and cigarettes twice a day. They are washed and have their clothes changed regularly. The dead even have a bowl in the corner of the room as their "toilet". Furthermore, the deceased are never left on their own and the lights are always left on for them when it gets dark. The families worry that if they don't take care of the corpses properly, the spirits of their departed loved ones will give them trouble.
Traditionally, special leaves and herbs were rubbed on the body to preserve it. But nowadays, a preserving chemical, formalin, is injected instead.
It leaves a powerful chemical reek in the room.
Lovingly stroking their father's leathery cheekbones, Mamak Lisa says they still feel a strong emotional connection with him. "Although we're all Christians," they explain, with hand on heart, "relatives often visit them or call on the phone to see how Dad's doing, because we believe that they can hear us and is still around."

Contrary to what I'm used to, I see no sign of fear of the dead here.
My own father passed away some years ago, and they were buried almost immediately - before I had time to fully grasp what had happened. I still haven't quite managed to deal with my grief.
Image caption Mamak Lisa
To my surprise, Lisa tells me that having their father in the house has helped them to grieve. It's given their time to adjust slowly to their new identity - that of a dead man.
During their lives, Torajans work hard to accumulate wealth. But rather than striving for a luxurious life, they're saving up for a glorious departure. Cirinda will lie here until their family is ready to say goodbye - both emotionally and financially. Their body will finally leave the family home during an unimaginably lavish funeral, after a grand procession around the village.
According to Torajan belief, funerals are where the soul finally leaves this Earth and starts its long and hard journey into Pooya - the final stage of the afterlife, where the soul gets reincarnated. Buffaloes are believed to be the carriers of the soul into the afterlife and that's why families sacrifice as many of them as they can, to help make the journey easier for the deceased.
Torajans spend most of their lives saving up for these rituals.
Once the families have saved up enough, they invite all friends and relatives from all over the world. The wealthier the deceased when alive, the larger and more elaborate these ceremonies.
The funeral I attend is for a man called Dengen, who died more than a year ago. Dengen was a rich and powerful man. Their funeral lasts for four days, during which 24 buffaloes and hundreds of pigs are sacrificed in their honour. Later, the meat is distributed among the guests, as they celebrate Dengen's life and their coming reincarnation. Their son tells me that the funeral has cost in excess of $50,000 - or more than 10 times the average annual income.
I couldn't help but to compare this lavish, loud and colourful outdoor funeral - filled with dance, upbeat music, laughter and of course blood - to my dad's. For him, we held a small ceremony with intimate family, in a small, dark and quiet venue. I am left with a very sad and dark memory of that day - in extraordinary contrast to what Dengen's family will remember from their funeral.
After the funeral, it's finally time to inter the dead.
Torajans are rarely buried in the ground. Instead, they are either interred in family tombs or placed inside or outside caves - as it's a mountainous region, there are many of them. These caves are yet another place where the afterlife seemingly connects with this one. Sometimes winding for kilometres, they hold innumerable coffins and corpses, and even loose skulls and bones. Friends and family bring "necessities" for their dead relatives - often money and cigarettes.
In a tradition pre-dating photography, the images of dead noble men and women are carefully carved out of wood. Known as tau tau, these sculptures wear the clothes, jewellery and even the hair of the deceased - silent sentinels looking out over this world from another plane. On average they cost about $1,000 to make.
But even interment doesn't mean goodbye. The physical relationship between dead and the living continues long after, through a ritual called ma'nene, or the "cleansing of the corpses". Every couple of years, families take the coffins of long-departed relatives out of their graves and open them up, for a big reunion with the dead. At ma'nene ceremonies, friends and family offer food and cigarettes to the dead and lovingly groom and clean them. Then they pose with them for new family portraits.
Torajan professor of sociology Andy Tandi Lolo describes it as a way of maintaining "social interaction between those who are alive and those who are dead".
After Sunday prayers, I accompany people from a Torajan village as they make their way from the church to a small square building with orange tiles and no windows. It's a family tomb. Chanting mixed with the sound of women crying creates a surreal atmosphere. Everybody's here for the ma'nene of Maria Solo, who died three years ago - they say she's now 93 - and was placed in this family tomb a year ago. Now it's time for them to come back out.
The men bring out a red cylindrical coffin decorated with geometrical patterns in gold and silver. On top of it, close family members place offerings to Maria - coca plant leaves, cigarettes, bitter nuts and fresh buffalo ears. But there is one more ritual that needs to be carried out before they open the coffin and that's a buffalo sacrifice.
They finally open the coffin and once again, that strong odour of musk and formalin fills the air. The body of a small old woman lies motionless inside. Them white hair is neatly tied back exposing their thin face. Them mouth and eyes are half-open and their grey skin makes them look more like a stone statue than a dead woman.
How do their children feel, seeing their mother like this? Them the eldest son, a business person wearing a baseball cap, who now lives in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, seems very calm. They tell me that it doesn't bother them at all - and not only that, it reminds them how patient their mother is and how much they love him. Just like Cirinda's family, Maria Solo's relatives still refer to them in the present tense as if they weren't dead at all.
Once the body is exposed, signs of grief and tension disappear. Even I stop feeling nervous. Another guest - particularly close to Maria Solo - is Estersobon, their daughter-in-law. They tell me that ma'nene lightens the burden of their grief and helps revive the memories of their long-departed loved-ones.
I tell Estersobon that I want to remember my late father the way they were when they were alive - and that I would worry that if I ever saw them dead, this would change the image I keep of them in my mind. But Estersobon insists that it makes no difference to the way family members remember the dead.
Once everyone has spent some time with Maria and taken a few family portraits with her, it is time to wrap them in a white sheet as symbol of changing their clothes. In many villages, they change the outfit for a new one and even take the corpse for a walk around the village. But these practices are slowly disappearing, as over time more than 80% of Torajans have turned away from the old animist religion, Aluk to dolo, and have become Christians. Little by little, the old ways are changing, as a result.
However, Christianity and Aluk to dolo have always coexisted, for as long as Christianity has been in this region. Andy Tandi Lolo says that when Dutch missionaries first arrived, less than a century ago, they tried to forbid animist religions altogether. By the 1950s, though, they had realised that if they wanted Torajans to accept the new faith, they would have to show flexibility, and allow them to continue their rituals.
In the rest of the world, these practices may seem bizarre. But perhaps the principles behind them are not so very different from those found in other cultures. Remembering the dead is something many of us try to do. The Torajans just take a very different approach.

This Quinoa and potato salad is super healthy and delicious. The core ingredient of this salad is quinoa, which is a complete plant based protein. So this salad is perfect for people following vegan diet and also for people who are celiac. This salad is a combination of all my favourite foods, so I make this quinoa potato salad very often.
This salad is very simple and easy to make. It only takes 30-40 minutes from start to end. You can start by preheating the oven and in the meantime prepare potato wedges. After potatoes are in the oven for roasting you can prepare quinoa. For plating this salad I have made bed of spinach and the add quinoa, potatoes, raisins, walnuts and drizzle with some Sriracha sauce.

Rio Tinto's first-half profits plunge 80 per cent; $US4.4 billion in 2014 down to $US806 million
Updated
Global mining company Rio Tinto has suffered a major slide in profit in its 2015 interim results, revealing a drop of more than 80 per cent.
The miner released its first-half results today, showing its net earnings of $US4.4 billion last year had tumbled to $US806 million in the same time period this year.
The fall is largely due to the plunging iron ore price as a result of a glut in the market and slowing demand from China.
Rio's half yearly underlying earnings of $US2.9 billion in 2015 were down by 43 per cent compared to last year's figure of $US5.1 billion.
The miner said its global production of 154 million tonnes was 11 per cent higher than in the first half of 2014, following a ramp up in Pilbara production.
The company said it had reduced costs by more than $US500 million and had a net debt of $US13.7 billion.
Rio said it expected to return more than $US6 billion to shareholders this year.
The company said cost reductions, exchange rates and lower energy costs had offset the almost 40 per cent iron ore price decline.
Seeing signs of recovery: Sam Walsh
Rio Tinto's chief executive, Sam Walsh, said these were challenging times for the industry.

"We've produced a very robust set of numbers despite what continues to be a pretty challenging environment for the mining industry," they said.
"For some time it's been apparent that the economic environment has been adjusting to what is now called 'the new normal'.
"But let's be clear - we'll see continued economic growth from this larger base, including an increase in the long-term demand for all of our commodities."
Mr Walsh suggested that while there was a shift to what they called the "new normal", demand for Rio's commodities should remain strong.
"Since 2008, developed markets in both Europe and USA have been through difficult periods.
"But we do now appear to be seeing signs of recovery.
"And we're starting to sense the potential from emerging market economies including India and Indonesia."
Mr Walsh predicted better times were ahead.
"The economic environment has been challenging particularly for commodities with some prices falling to levels not seen since 2009," they said.
"But this cyclical weakness will pass as the momentum of global economic growth picks up and the commodity markets rebalance."
Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton accused of collusion
Rio Tinto and its rival BHP Billiton were accused of being behind the massive slump in iron ore prices.
Fortescue Metals Group founder Andrew Forrest claimed the two majors flooded the market with iron in a bid to gain more market share by knocking out higher cost producers.
It led the Federal Government to announce it would launch an inquiry into whether the two companies were in collusion, but the Commonwealth later reneged on the move.

BLACKBURN – A group of Muslim primary school pupils from Rawdhatul Uloom Primary School delivered toys to hospitalized patients in a children's ward in Blackburn.
“As a whole school, we wanted to bring a ray of sunshine to the lives of ill children at the hospital,” Nahida Khan, primary school teacher, told Asian Image on Friday.
“We sent out letters to parents asking to send in gifts for us to donate at the hospital. We had a tremendous turnout and the school council visited the hospital to deliver the gifts,” they added.
The visit to Blackburn Teaching Hospital was organized by the school in partnership with national educational charity Ilm2Amal, (Knowledge To Action).
The donation was an important part of the pupil's wider education, educating children about the importance of community action.
“This was an amazing project for both the pupils and patients, which they thoroughly enjoyed,” Ilm2Amal Chief Executive Waqaus Ali said.
“It was a pleasure to see the smiles on the faces of the young patients and their parents, despite the difficulties that they face in their lives.”
The visit was praised by the Children's Ward Manager Sister Cheryl Fitzgerald.
“Many thanks to the primary school pupils and to Ilm2Amal for their generous donations,” they said.
“You could tell from their reaction that our patients really appreciated the gifts.”
Former CIA Director David Petraeus on Friday called out politicians who are spreading “anti-Muslim bigotry” in a Washington Post op-ed.

Petraeus wrote that they were concerned about “proposals from various quarters for blanket discrimination against people on the basis of their religion,” an implicit shot at presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE, who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the country.
“Some justify these measures as necessary to keep us safe — dismissing any criticism as ‘political correctness,' ” Petraeus wrote. “Others play down such divisive rhetoric as the excesses of political campaigns here and in Europe, which will fade away after the elections are over.
“I fear that neither is true; in fact, the ramifications of such rhetoric could be very harmful — and lasting.”
The former CIA director blasted such proposals as “toxic,” arguing that they play into the plans of terrorist groups trying to rally Muslims against the United States and other Western nations.
“Such statements directly undermine our ability to defeat Islamist extremists by alienating and undermining the allies whose help we most need to win this fight: namely, Muslims,” they continued, noting that Muslim allies were essential to war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“I fear that those who demonize and denigrate Islam make it more likely that it will be our own men and women who ultimately have to shoulder more of this fight — at greater cost in dollars and lives.”
Though the column does not mention the real estate mogul by name, Petraeus appears to be taking aim at Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country.
Petraeus also noted that it's important for the U.S. to combat Islamic extremism and work to “prevent terrorists from infiltrating our borders and exploiting our immigration policies.”
“But it is precisely because the danger of Islamist extremism is so great that politicians here and abroad who toy with anti-Muslim bigotry must consider the effects of their rhetoric,” they wrote.
“Demonizing a religious faith and its adherents not only runs contrary to our most cherished and fundamental values as a country; it is also corrosive to our vital national security interests and, ultimately, to the United States' success in this war.”
Prog metal never seems to be stronger than now, there's no denying the fantastic divergence within the genre that the metal scene has gifted us with. I love Dream Theater as much as any other prog head, but at the end of the day it's great to have groups like Cyborg Octopus around really going for it as far as having an impossible to categorize nature to their sound.
While far from a clone, Cyborg Octopus clearly take the prog direction of groups like Between The Buried And Me and Mr. Bungle to heart by matching and muddling together an endless combination of different genres and sounds in every song. Learning To Breathe is the prog metal album to beat so far this year in my estimation. Jam below and get super weird with Learning To Breathe. If you dig it, you can pre-order it at their bigcartel page. Be sure to follow them over on their Cyborg Octopus Facebook page as well.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has added their name to a letter from a group of progressive Senators, calling for the public option to be included in the health care bill through the reconciliation process.
“At a time when there is deep skepticism and mistrust of the private insurance industry, when just last month a major health insurer in California announced it would raise its premiums by a whopping 39 percent in one fell swoop, the American people have made it clear that they want the option to buy their insurance through a Medicare-type, government-run public insurance plan,” Sanders said in a press release.

CLOSE Tyler Andrew Washington is very much alive, but when their mother died two years ago, the Social Security Administration accidentally declare them dead. Now the 12-year-old must prove he's still alive. VPC

TINTON FALLS, N.J. — Meet Tyler Andrew Washington.
He's dead, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
But the 12-year-old boy — who rides a scooter, wishes they had a girlfriend and keeps a large framed photo of a tractor-trailer that their dad's friend owns over their bed — is very much alive.
Shortly after their mother died two years ago, the Social Security Administration also declared them deceased. Their aunt, Ellen Mirasola of Jackson, N.J., and their dad, Miguel Washington, have battled several agencies of the federal government to right the error.
The erroneous information in the IRS system came from the Social Security Administration.
After the Asbury Park Press called the administration Friday, a spokesperson apologized to Mirasola within an hour and promised to fix the glitch immediately that got into the IRS's system, Mirasola said.
It's unknown how quickly that will happen. With another April 15 Tax Day upon us, Tyler's erroneous death haunts the family. Last year, Miguel Washington successfully filed their 2013 taxes that listed Tyler as a dependent.
“He's driving me crazy every day, so I know he's alive. ... What happens in five or six years when they go to get a job?” Miguel Washington, Tinton Falls, N.J.
But this year, the E-File system would not allow them to do the same. IRS staff told the 55-year-old Miguel Washington it was because their son was listed as dead, Washington said.
Making $8.80 an hour as a van driver who transports people with disabilities, Miguel Washington can use whatever benefit they receive from listing Tyler as a dependent, the former long-distance trucker said. They left that job behind a year and a half ago to care for Tyler.
Since then, they and their son have been living at the Martin Motel here with the help of public assistance.
A spokesperson for the IRS declined to discuss even general questions about cases like this one. They contended that whatever they said could be applied to this specific case, and the IRS cannot discuss individual cases.
"He's driving me crazy every day, so I know he's alive," Miguel Washington said, teasingly, although their voice carried a hint of frustration. "He's a 12-year-old kid. Somebody's got to clear this up. What happens in five or six years when they go to get a job? And I don't want to see this happen to someone else's kid."

John Shallman, spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, declined to discuss details of the case, citing privacy concerns. But Shallman confirmed that they spoke to Mirasola.
"All corrective actions have been taken and the Social Security Administration regrets any inconvenience, difficulties or problems this caused," they said.
The Social Security Administration has run into problems before by inaccurately reporting living people as deceased. From May 2007 through April 2010, the administration's Death Master File erroneously listed as many as 36,657 living individuals as dead, according to the administration's Office of Inspector General.
The official pronouncement of death frustrates the boy. The sixth-grader at Tinton Falls Middle School greets it with gallows humor beyond their years.
"I just want to know where I'm buried and what I died of," Tyler said without smiling.
Something far more important is on the wall of Tyler's motel room than the photo of the truck: a picture of Tyler's mom, Bonnie Frankle, who died at age 41 on Jan. 22, 2013, of kidney disease. The Social Security Administration's error occurred immediately after that tragedy in Tyler's life.
"We are sorry to learn that TYLER A. WASHINGTON, the person for whom you were receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments died January 22, 2013," read a form letter from the Social Security Administration office in Egg Harbor, N.J. "Please accept our sincere sympathy."
That letter was sent to Bonnie Frankle three weeks after they died. Staff at the Social Security Administration office in Brick, N.J., told Mirasola that "someone pushed the wrong button," Mirasola said.
Tyler lost benefits, including money for medication they were taking. Mirasola had to pay about $700 a month for that medicine, they said. They eventually are reimbursed.

"Bonnie lived for their children," Mirasola said, about the mother of five. Tyler was their only child with Miguel Washington. "All they wanted in their life was for their kids to get a good education and get along with everybody."
Mirasola, who had temporary custody of Tyler during Frankle's decline, quickly began the process of declaring Tyler undead.
Because Mirasola did not have permanent custody of Tyler; however, their official death could not be reversed without a court order, staff at the Social Security Administration office in Brick told Mirasola. Tyler's presence at the office did not matter, they said.
The complication over custody sent Mirasola from Ocean County to Monmouth County.
A Family Court judge in Monmouth County, Leslie-Ann M. Justus, issued an order on March 15, 2013, that read, "This Court FINDS that Tyler Washington, born July 25, 2002, is alive and well, not deceased."
Although it took more than two months to straighten out, the Social Security Administration also declared Tyler alive, and Mirasola was reinstated as payee, something they had done temporarily as their sister was dying. Them status as payee was suspended when the mixup occurred.
It took another five or six weeks to have Tyler's benefits restored, they said.
In fall 2013, Miguel Washington applied to become Tyler's payee, but the Social Security Administration officials in Neptune, N.J., told them that records there showed Tyler was dead, Miguel Washington said.
Mirasola continues to be the payee. They drive the 25 miles or so from Jackson to Tinton Falls to hand the check over to Miguel Washington when they receive it, they said.

Since Washington has a low income, the holdup in the transfer is keeping them and Tyler from receiving more money, Miguel Washington and Mirasola said.
Shallman would not discuss in detail the breakdown in communication between the Social Security Administration offices in the two counties.
"We'll have to deal with that," they said without elaborating.
For their part, Tyler is working hard at being a kid, not an easy task in a motel complex that has no other children. They drop in on adults living in the complex, plays soccer by themselves and takes long walks in the woods, they said.
"It keeps me calm," Tyler said.
Although he's a boy lost in a bureaucratic mess, Tyler enjoys the strong support of their father and aunt.
Before Shallman vowed to make sure the Social Security Administration corrects the error, Miguel Washington told Tyler that nothing would stop them from trying to fix the problem until everyone knows Tyler is alive.
"If it kills me doing it, I'll just keep doing it," Miguel Washington said.

Last week the high court ruled on the process the government needs to follow in order to trigger article 50 and initiate Britain's exit from the European Union. In today's blog, Dr Robin Eagles discusses the background to the 17th century precedents the judges cited in their ruling…
Last week's judgment by the high court that Theresa May's government was not able to use its powers under the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 made reference to a number of historical precedents. Many of those cited were of fairly recent vintage but two referred to examples from the 17th century – a period in which the fundamental relationship between crown and parliament was disputed, fought over and codified. The first referred to Sir Edward Coke and the second to the 1689 Bill of Rights.
Coke (1552-1634), the brilliant yet haughty lawyer of the reign of James I is generally acknowledged to have been the premier jurist of their day. Having been elected to the Commons for Aldeburgh in 1589, four years later they were chosen as speaker of the House of Commons and in 1594 appointed attorney general, a position they retained at the accession of the new king, James I. As such they were a leading figure in the prosecution of, among others, the 1605 Gunpowder plotters. The following year they were promoted lord chief justice of common pleas and in this new role Coke proved a champion of the common law courts, which had been coming under increasing pressure from other venues such as the church courts. Coke increasingly acquired a popular following while clashing with the crown (and others) over the extent of the common law courts' jurisdiction. They also proved an increasingly fierce critic of the creeping tendency of James I to rely on proclamations. Thus in 1610 they insisted that not only could the king not ‘change any part of the Common law' but that it was also beyond the competence of the crown ‘to create any offence by their Proclamation which was not an offence before without Parliament'. Three years later, Coke was removed from their office of chief justice of common pleas and shifted to that of chief justice of king's bench. Technically this was a promotion, but in effect it was an effort to limit their field of operations and also to punish them by removing them to the less lucrative (if senior) post. Coke refused to be curbed and three years later, following continued criticisms of the king, they were removed from the bench altogether. Although they remained nominally a member of the government as a privy councillor and holder of minor household office, Coke continued their complaints and their steady drift towards the opposition. Early in Charles I's reign they were closely identified with the passage of the Petition of Right (1628), which complained of a series of abuses carried out on the king's authority.
Disputes over the appropriate balance within the parliamentary trinity (crown, Lords and Commons) formed much of the background to the troubled middle years of the 17th century, and continued to preoccupy politicians and jurists following the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. In the reign of James II a particular set of circumstances – the accession of a Roman Catholic monarch reluctant to accede to regular meetings of Parliament and eager to force through an unpopular policy of relaxing the laws against Catholics – brought the situation once again into sharp relief.
By the time James fled the scene in the winter of 1688 they had already experienced several run-ins with both the courts and Parliament. Unable to convince the latter to agree to their religious policies, James resorted to their prerogative powers to dispense Catholics from the need to submit to the usual oaths that most found unable to subscribe to without compromising their faith. This was exemplified in the test case Godden v. Hales (1686), in which Sir Edward Hales a recent convert to Catholicism, was brought before the courts on information provided by their servant (acting on Hales's orders) following Hales's appointment as colonel of an army regiment (a post for which they ought to have been debarred as a Catholic). Having been convicted at the local assizes, Hales's case moved up to King's Bench, where the judges concluded in favour of the king's right to make use of their prerogative power to dispense men like Hales from taking the oaths. While many jurists agreed with the judges' interpretation of the king's rights in the case, others were discontented at the turn of events – not least because of the way in which James had dismissed a number of judges deemed unsympathetic to their cause before the matter reached the courts.
Subsequent events added to suspicion of the king's methods and of the need to do something about him. The acquittal of the Seven Bishops in the summer of 1688 proved the catalyst for a small cadre of politicians to make their move against the king, who was weakened by this setback in the courts. The resulting invasion and triumph of William of Orange offered the politicians gathered for the Convention Parliament of January 1689 the opportunity of insisting that William and Mary accede to a new ‘Bill of Rights' setting out the relationship between monarch and people in return for the offer of the crown. Closely allied to the earlier Petition of Right, the Bill of Rights first listed the ways in which the former regime had exceeded its powers with the very first article asserting that James had done this “By assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws, and the execution of laws, without consent of Parliament”. It then proceeded to set out the new contract by which monarch, Parliament, and subjects were to be governed, noting in the first article “That the pretended power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by regal authority, without consent of parliament, is illegal'. On 13 February 1689 the Declaration of Rights (the document from which the bill descended) was presented to William and Mary at Whitehall. Following their acceptance of it, they were proclaimed formally as the country's new king and queen.

Dropping a “she,” “he,” “her” or “him” doesn't typically get a second thought in everyday conversation, but it's time to reconsider the pronoun. As awareness of non-binary gender identities and transgender people becomes more prevalent in mainstream culture, so too must the regard for the preferred gender pronouns (PGPs) of the people who identify as such.
A California artist is trying to bring awareness to this issue with an array of “Hello Pronoun” stickers and buttons. With six different pronoun varieties to choose from - “Thy/Them/Theirs, He/Him/His, She/Her/Hers, Ze/Hir/Hirs, Xe/Xem/Xyrs, and fill-in-the-blank, wearers can tell the world how they identify. Gone are the days of assuming someone else's gender identity upon meeting them, it's time to welcome a new era of mindfulness.
“Whether being used when meeting new people or as a gentle reminder to old friends, this sticker uses a familiar format to communicate the information quickly and easily,” explains the Non-Newtonian Gender Fluid website.

The world's largest and most resilient BitTorrent site plans to redefine “cloud computing” with a plan to move at least some of its servers onto unmanned drones miles above Sweden.
In a Sunday blog post, The Pirate Bay announced new "Low Orbit Server Stations" that will house the site's servers and files on unmanned, GPS-controlled, aircraft drones.
One of the sites administrators, MrSpock, said with the advent of miniature computers such as the Raspberry Pi, a $35 micro computer the size of a thumb drive that includes a WiFi and SD card slot for storage, the site can take its servers far from any law enforcement.
“We're going to experiment with sending out some small drones that will float some kilometers up in the air,” MrSpock wrote. “This way our machines will have to be shut down with aeroplanes in order to shut down the system. A real act of war.”
The Swedish site has operated since 2003 by an “anti-copyright organization” and despite numerous raids, remains one of the most popular music and movie pirating sites on the web. The site hosts thousands of “torrent” files—tiny files that allow users to connect to and download files from other users. The system is one of the most popular ways to anonymously share large files and often comes under fire from copyright holders, who argue that the service allows people to easily share copyrighted movies, music, games and software.
The site has repeatedly mocked American copyright laws and has said that American laws “[do] not apply [in Sweden].” Earlier this year, four of its staffers were sentenced to Swedish prison. Last year, the site apparently moved some of its servers to a mountain cave complex in Sweden.
“Experiencing raids, espionage and death threats, we're still here,” the site wrote in a blog post last month. “We've been through hell and back and it has made us tougher than ever.”
The move to hovering servers could make it nearly impossible for authorities to shut the site down, a fact not lost on the site's administrators.
“We can't limit ourselves to hosting things just on land anymore,” MrSpock wrote. “When time comes we will host in all parts of the galaxy, being true to our slogan of being the galaxy's most resilient system.”

In a world where digital technology reigns supreme, freedom of speech should not depend on the whims of a few powerful corporations and government rules. Increasingly, it does.
A delegation of right-wing activists will travel this week to Silicon Valley. They will be supplicants at the throne of Facebook, a platform so pervasive that it has unprecedented power to decide what's news—a platform that could consume journalism itself in coming years. They will be begging Mark Zuckerberg for their indulgence. What they should be doing—what we all should be doing—is finding ways to reduce their company's dominance.
The promise of the internet and personal technology was in its decentralization: one of the most profound advances for liberty in history. Yet at a rapid rate we're seeing it re-centralized, as governments and corporations—often with users' willing, if short-sighted, cooperation—are taking control in the center, creating choke points over what we say and how we can say it.
The Facebook situation is helping people, including journalists, see that these choke points are a threat to freedom of expression. For countless millions, Facebook is the new public square. But its terms of service override the First Amendment, as activists and others have discovered. To assemble and speak in the new public square, we need permission from its owner.
Facebook is only one of those choke points—telecoms, giant technology companies, payment systems, and, of course, governments are among the others. Freedom of expression is only one of the liberties at risk—if you're being spied on, by companies and governments, your freedom to assemble in common cause is limited.
Progress itself is at stake. Because information is the core of invention in a world where software, microprocessors, and networks are becoming part of everything we touch, the freedom to innovate itself should not depend on the commercial and political wishes of powerful governments and corporations. Increasingly, it does.
One might argue that this is just how markets work: a normal re-centralization and rule-making after messy growth. I'd argue that it represents market failure, because monopolies and oligopolies are the enemy of innovation.
The centralized powers are not going to give up their growing control willingly. We have to take it back. But we need help.
We need help from government: policies that push competition, rather than encourage monopolies and cartels. Specifically, the antitrust authorities need to be looking hard—from appearances they're not looking at all—at the owners of these choke points.
We also need help from foundations: philanthropic organizations that exist, in some key ways, to address market failures that threaten the common good. A few foundations have made tentative steps into this arena, but their efforts have been timid, at best.
They need to do more. I wish I could persuade them to see this as a disaster for our collective future. I wish they would get together and pool several billion dollars to support initiatives—including government policies—designed to help re-decentralize our technology and communications.
If they don't step up, we need wealthy individuals who recognize the threats to speech, innovation, and liberty itself inherent in centralized control. Perhaps a few of the newly minted Silicon Valley billionaires—many of whom accumulated their wealth by being part of the re-centralization—could recognize what they've done and lead the way out of the situation they helped create.
We—you and I—are part of the solution, too. Unless we recognize what's at stake, and think about changing our own habits, we're part of the problem. Unless we advocate for liberty, we're helping the control freaks win. We'll need to do things individually, and as members of communities at all levels, to change the trajectory.
This truly is an emergency. Let's hope it's not too late to do something about it.

Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Israel last week for the first time in more than a year, and with no intention of restarting peace talks. This followed a rare agreement between President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu that there is no chance for real negotiations in the near future - prompting more voices on the Israeli right to demand a policy change, and even to call for the annulment of the Oslo Agreements. Yet it is the same right wing that has benefitted from Oslo, or to be exact - from the fact that the accord was ratified but never achieved its goal.
The treaty, signed 22 years ago, aimed to build peace gradually: Israelis would transfer control over Palestinian cities to the newly created Palestinian Authority, led by Yasser Arafat. The Palestinians would recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce terror; five years later, negotiations leading to a comprehensive agreement would begin - and end with the creation of a Palestinian state.
That final stage never reached fruition, of course: Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated by an extremist Jew, both sides failed to live up to their obligations, and today the two nations are living in a twilight zone: the PA exists, Palestinians have self-rule in some of the territories, but still don't have a state.
Before Oslo there were 100,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank. Today their number has increased four-fold. Bypassing Ramallah on the road from Jerusalem to the settlement of Ofra, we meet Pinhas Valerstein, a veteran settler leader, who tells us, "The great paradox is that this whole infrastructure of roads bypassing Palestinian towns and leading to and from Jewish settlements is a foundation that Rabin insisted on, and these roads gave us the main incentive to build more settlements." Still, they insist: "Oslo was like a road accident for us."
"Why didn't you ever annul the agreement? Dismantle the Palestinian Authority, annex the territory and be done with it?" we ask. "Because I understand the reality we live in," replies Valerstein candidly. "I realize what the consequences would be. We can't live without an American veto in the UN. We're part of the international community."
Twenty-two years ago the settlers were devastated by Oslo, and saw it as an act of treason. But they regrouped quickly and did everything to undermine it, to create "facts on the ground." They know, even if they won't admit it, that they succeeded in turning Oslo into their trump card, using the fact that the Palestinian Authority exists and that the Palestinians rule themselves - a fact that for years has served to ease diplomatic pressure on Israel - to continue building settlements. As Valerstein said, "The agreement's signing cut me in the heart. But I wake up every morning and build another building."
Rabin believed that the settlement enterprise was a Zionist mistake. At the same time, they had deep resentment and suspicion toward Palestinian leaders, and they saw a double opportunity in Oslo: separation from the Palestinians and a separation from the dream of Greater Israel. That's why they took a chance on a plan presented by their staunchest political enemy - Shimon Peres.
We ask Yossi Beilin, who initiated the Oslo agreement, "What was more surprising to you - that Rabin took a chance on the terrorist Yasser Arafat or that they agreed to something Shimon Peres proposed?" "Tough call," Beilin replies. "I knew then that negotiations had to be clandestine, or else Rabin would stop us in our tracks." Twenty-two years later, we ask Beilin whether Oslo failed. "It was made to fail, certainly, but Oslo's biggest curse is that is still exists. Today it is the political right that is desperately holding on to the Oslo accord, because it gave it the umbrella under which it could continue building settlements," says Beilin.
Beilin is proud of one thing, though. "The fact Netanyahu changed their views and talks of a Palestinian state is extremely significant," they say. "I don't even care if lying in bed at night, Netanyahu actually believes it will ever happen."
Driving to Jericho during this latest round of tension between Israelis and Palestinians is not the safest experience, but it is necessary to talk to the third party in the story. Saeb Erekat was a key player back in the Oslo days and remains one of the Palestinians' chief peace negotiators. "Rabin was tough," they say. "He wanted to see in every sentence, in every agreement that the state of Israel will live on for 300 years. Netanyahu looks at every sentence and sees the evening news. There's a difference between being a tough negotiator and a non-negotiator."
"Netanyahu wasn't elected in a vacuum," we say. "He was elected because Israelis gave up hope, because terror never stopped." Erekat replies, "How can you stop terror if you continue to build settlements?"
"Israelis would dismantle every settlement if they could live in peace," we reply, and Erekat shoots back, "You gave in to extremism."
"So did you - Hamas triumphed in Gaza, it won in general elections in the PA nine years ago." It is a heated debate. The four words they keep repeating are, "You don't see us."
As Israelis, listening to Erekat isn't easy. But they are certainly right about one thing - Oslo gave Israelis the opportunity not to see the Palestinians. They have self-rule, they deal with their internal affairs, and unless there is fresh violence, we don't see them, we don't want to.
In the end, Oslo unleashed another one of the paradoxes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - it was the Israeli left, always accused of being too sympathetic toward the Palestinians, that wanted the separation in the first place, and the most significant peace agreement the left signed ultimately played into the hands of the Israeli right. And that is precisely why the current right-wing government wants to maintain Oslo: It's the perfect justification for the lack of Israeli progress toward peace.

Normally, when it comes to app stores and rejections, it's usually the App Store that's under fire, because Google Play is open to far more apps, and even if they reject something, it can still be sold elsewhere. But apparently Google decided to get into the fun by pulling Threes ($5.99) from Google Play. Why? Because it used 2048 (Free) as a search keyword.
Google Play has taken Threes off the store because we used "2048" as a search keyword 😡 — Asher Vollmer (@AsherVo) May 5, 2015
Mind you, 2048 only existed after Threes came out, and given the nature of the game, it's hard to pinpoint who owns the name since Gabriele Cirulli's version was inspired by other versions with similar names.
You can say rules are rules, but this is utter nonsense on Google's behalf. Google Play has been a notorious hive of scum and villainy when it comes to games that use names and keywords of dubious value to promote themselves. Google doesn't have the cachet to pull a power move like this. Apple at least has years of silly approval decisions. Google Play definitely has gotten a lot better, to where a search for “Angry Birds" shows all official games first. But here's what a search for Threes pulls up right now:
Notice a game with a literal 2048 + Threes icon on Google Play. Oh, and for fun, here's what a 2048 search pulls up:
Pretty much any search for any popular game will turn up something that probably has a trademark or copyright that's being used without permission. Again, things are not as bad as they once were, and the App Store's got its own game title tomfoolery going on. But this Threes situation is ignoring thousands of active violations of store rules, intellectual property, and just common decency, to nail a big-name tile without warning for a questionable violation.
If Google had handled this situation with more nuance – say, rejecting an update, reverting a change to the search keywords, or providing any sort of notice to the publisher of one of the most notable games on their store – which Asher Vollmer confirmed that they did not – this wouldn't be a problem. Again, rules are rules and I'm not opposed to the enforcement of these rules because Google Play does need cleaning up so that trademarks and copyrights aren't being violated and users are finding what they actually want. But Threes using the name of a game that no one really owns; that was inspired by Threes; and has thousands of other games using that title. Using the nuclear option? That's a stupid decision and they need to restore Threes to the store right now. And if they want to clean up their store, there's a thousand better things they could, and should be doing.
Update: Looks like the game is back on Google Play. Good on Google for fixing this ASAP.
Wisconsin voters are headed to the polls today, and it looks like it will be a big day for Ted Cruz.
The average of polls over the last week gives them a 3.1 point lead over Donald Trump. Cruz has led in five of six polls by between 5-10 points. Trump led by 10 points in the only other poll – an ARG poll that is the most recent of the polls. But ARG has had a mixed record this election cycle. They have been very close to actual vote totals in some states, but badly missed on Michigan, where they had John Kasich winning (Trump actually won by 12).
Looking at all six polls, you come away thinking Ted Cruz will win, I'd guess by about 8 points. That will be a huge win for him, keeping their campaign alive, and giving energy to the #NeverTrump folks whose goal is not so much to elect Ted Cruz, but to deny Donald Trump 1237 delegates before the GOP Convention. If they can keep them from that number, they intend to nominate someone else – perhaps not Trump OR Cruz. But first, they know they have to stop Trump.

For the first time ever in a statewide Field Poll, a majority of state voters expressed support for legalizing and taxing marijuana. A poll released last week showed 56 percent of Californians support legalization.
Earlier this year, Assemblymember Tom Ammiano (D-San Francisco) introduced legislation that would tax and regulate marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol. The Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education act (AB 390) would create a regulatory structure similar to that used for beer, wine and liquor, permitting taxed sales to adults while barring sales to or possession by those under 21.
“With the state in the midst of an historic economic crisis, the move toward regulating and taxing marijuana is simply common sense. This legislation would generate up to $1.3 billion in much-needed revenue for the state, restrict access to only those over 21, end the environmental damage to our public lands from illicit crops, and improve public safety by redirecting law enforcement efforts to more serious crimes, Ammiano said. “California has the opportunity to be the first state in the nation to enact a smart, responsible public policy for the control and regulation of marijuana.”
The poll bolstered the call for legalized marijuana that has stirred since Ammiano introduced their legislation and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the government would no longer raid and prosecute legal marijuana medical dispensaries.
“One of the most respected research firms in the country has confirmed other recent polls and our sense of the groundswell that followed the introduction of AB 390 by Assemblymember Ammiano,” said Stephen Gutwillig, California State Director of the Drug Policy Alliance. “Californians are ready to end decades of failed and wasteful marijuana prohibition. Just as we led the nation in the compassionate adoption of medical marijuana, this state will set the standard for common-sense regulation, generating substantial new revenue for California and enhancing public safety.”
Though Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said they would not sign legislation legalizing marijuana, the state's ongoing billion-dollar fiscal crisis is making the idea of taxing legal marijuana to raise revenue, while reducing the strains of the grossly overcrowded prisons, more worthy of consideration for other legislators and voters.
“We are seeing a real sea-change in public attitudes; public opinion has reversed itself; this year marks the first time that polls have shown a majority for legalization; the economic crisis is making people question whether it makes sense to spend more money on marijuana prohibition,” said Dale Gieringer of NORML.
Last month a San Francisco supervisor said the time had come for the city to consider legalization as well.

Aiming to counter President Donald Trump's previous criticisms, the Japanese prime minister is expected to roll out a massive economic cooperation initiative in a meeting with the U.S. president.
The so-called “Japan-U.S. growth and employment initiative,” which is expected to be presented when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visits the White House Feb. 10, will involve $450 billion in market growth through new investments and the creation of 700,000 new jobs, reports the Yomiuri Shimbun.
Japan will reportedly invest in infrastructure development, as well as robotics, artificial intelligence, cyber, space, and defense projects in the U.S.
Among the projects included in the initiative are high-speed rail projects, plans for transportation infrastructure upgrades, technology sharing programs, advanced power generation projects, and other high-end programs.
At this time though, it isn't confirmed whether or not the prime minister will present the initiative during their planned meeting with Trump.
Observers suspect the Japanese government may be trying to stay in Trump's good graces after recent criticisms.
While the U.S.-Japanese alliance was strengthened under the previous administration, Trump has criticized Japan for allegedly engaging in unfair trade practices, casting a degree of uncertainty over the relationship.
Trump asserts that Japan intentionally restricts American access to Japanese auto markets through trade barriers and manipulates its currency.
“We sell a car into Japan and they do things to us that make it impossible to sell cars in Japan,” Trump told a group of business leaders last Monday.
Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. was $60 billion in 2016. While 40 percent of all Japanese shipments to the U.S. consisted of cars and auto parts, U.S. auto exports to Japan were limited. American cars made up less than a third of one percent of all passenger cars sold in Japan last year.
Japan exported 1.6 million cars to the U.S. in 2015, while the U.S only sent over 19,000 cars.
The Japanese government rejects Trump's accusations, asserting that it does not impose tariffs on U.S. auto imports, nor does it utilize any other discriminatory trade barriers.
“You look at what Japan has done over the years. They play the money market, they play the devaluation market and we sit there like a bunch of dummies,” Trump said Tuesday, blasting Japan for manipulating its currency.
Japan argues that Trump's criticisms are “totally incorrect.”
The reported economic cooperation initiative, which has not yet been officially confirmed, appears to be an attempt to convince the new U.S. administration that Japan is committed to fair trade and meaningful economic cooperation.
Japan is also expected to increase energy imports from the U.S., Reuters reports.
The focus, though, is reportedly jobbing creation. “Trump only cares about numbers. Everything has to be linked to job creation,” a Japanese diplomat told Fortune, noting that Japan needs to show that Japanese companies will create U.S. jobs.

Offensive guard Colin McGovern will use their final season of eligibility at Virginia, according to 247Sports' Steve Wiltfong.
The Notre Dame senior will join Irish teammate John Montelus, another offensive guard who last month announced they would spend the 2017 season at Virginia. The 6-foot-4, 310-pound guard started eight games and appeared in 21 for the Irish.
McGovern won the right guard competition over Hunter Bivin and Tristen Hoge during fall camp. They started the first six games of the season before they were sidelined with an ankle injury. In ND's 30-27 win over Miami, McGovern suffered their second diagnosed concussion in the past year. McGovern started the following week against Navy before appearing as a reserve in the final three games.
Bivin, who also has a fifth-year option, has not announced whether they will return to ND. Rising sophomores Tommy Kraemer, Liam Eichenberg and the junior-to-be Hoge are all expected to compete for the starting job at right guard.

A U.S. Army Green Beret said a “profound lack of strategy” has plagued the 14-year war effort in Afghanistan.
“The enemy operates with impunity throughout the country due to our relentless commitment to avoid principled strategy and decision-making processes,” the Special Forces soldier says in a sworn statement, according to a report by national security correspondent Rowan Scarborough.
The soldier said the Obama administration's current battle plan calls for most U.S. troops to remain in forward operating bases as less-skilled Afghan troops fight the Taliban alone. “It is not working,” they said.
“There is a fine line between not conducting operations to keep people out of harm's way and not conducting operations in such a fashion that it actually increases overall risk to force and risk to mission,” the Green Beret said, according to the the Washington Times report.
The soldier “filed their statement in the fall investigation into the mistaken U.S. airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, north of Kabul. A relatively small invasion force of Taliban took control of the city. It was up to this soldier's Operational Detachment Alpha to organize an Afghan force to infiltrate the city and take back buildings. All names and ranks are redacted in the investigative report.
“A special operation AC-130U “Spooky” gunship opened a 30-minute volley of gun and cannon fire, killing 42 staff and patients. The crew received the order to fire from a Green Beret officer on the ground and their Joint Terminal Attack Controller.
“The Green Beret who filed the critical statement was not that officer but was a member of the Operational Detachment Alpha holed up in a police station while the Afghan force moved on what was supposed to be the real target — a Taliban-held security building.”
The operation on Sept. 29-Oct. 3 led the soldier to accuse commanders of “moral cowardice.”
“When an ODA's mission runs headlong into national strategy, and the detachment asks for guidance on the level of commitment and receives nothing back over a 96-hour period, that's an abject failure of leadership,” the Green Beret wrote.
They said those running the command centers of playing it safe to prevent harm to their careers.
“Inaction or indecision does, however, enable convenient political expedience, where one can reap the rewards of success without facing the responsibility and consequence of failure,” the soldier said. “Without commitment to a particular course of action or strategy chosen by a subordinate, a leader can smile for the camera while handing out an award or sidestep the bailiff when the gavel drops on the judge's bench.”
“It's not a strategy, and in fact it's a recipe for disaster in that kinetic of an environment. How have we, as a force, as a group of officers, become so lost from the good lessons that our mentors taught us? I will tell you how. It is a decrepit state that grows out of the expansion of moral cowardice, careerism and compromise devoid of principle, exchanged for cheap personal gain.
“We owe the man on the ground more than that, because for him, the decision that they make hopefully lands them somewhere between the judge's gavel and the enemy bullet.”
The U.S. has 9,800 troops in Afghanistan and will keep about 5,000 there next year. Some Republicans want that number increased, saying the Afghan National Security Forces are not ready to go it alone and will succumb to the Taliban, which have launched the spring fighting season.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sheffield City Council has proposed a series of changes to waste services as part of plans to save £63m
Plans to shake up bin collection services in Sheffield to save £3.4m have been outlined by the council.
Among the proposals are plans to introduce shared bins, scrap extra Christmas collections and charge £20 for replacement black bins.
A public consultation on the issue will run until 1 April.
Sheffield City Council claimed the proposed changes were the result of government-imposed cuts which have meant it must save £63m by 2016.
Under plans to introduce shared bins it said: "Shared bins will be provided, rather than individual bins for every household, in areas where there is limited space at each property to store bins, and there is space in the local amenity to provide shared bins".
Councillor Julie Dore, the Labour leader of Sheffield City Council, said: "Part of our budget savings involve coming up with proposals for our waste service that increase efficiency where possible, while still providing a good service for everyone in the city.
"We welcome people's views and will act upon them so that we do what is best for Sheffield in terms of waste management and recycling."

Honduras's President Juan Orlando Hernández and opposition leader Salvador Nasralla have both declared victory in Sunday's presidential poll.
Supporters of the two candidates have been celebrating on the streets.
With 57% of votes counted, the electoral tribunal has so far given Mr Nasralla the lead.
They have just over 45% of the vote and Mr Hernández just over 40%, the tribunal's president announced in the early hours of Sunday.
Salvador Nasralla
64-year-old former TV presenter and sports journalist
Heads the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship, a coalition of parties from the left and the right
Their parents are of Lebanese descent
Ran for the presidency in 2013 but lost to Juan Orlando Hernández
Has campaigned on a promise to battle corruption
Juan Orlando Hernández
49-year-old lawyer
Heads the right-wing National Alliance
Is the 15th of 17 children, two of their siblings are also in politics
Is the first Honduran president to run for a second term after the supreme court lifted a ban on re-election
Says that if elected, they will continue fighting Honduras' influential criminal gangs
Opinion polls conducted before the election suggested Mr Hernández would win, but Mr Nasralla had recently made headway.
President Hernández has been heavily criticised by the opposition for standing for a second term even though re-election was prohibited under the Honduran constitution, until a 2015 Supreme Court ruling overturned the ban.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Opposition leader Salvador Nasralla (right) has also proclaimed themselves as victor in the vote
Shortly before the electoral tribunal announced the partial results, President Hernández told cheering supporters that they were certain of victory.
They were joined by the crowds in shouts of "Four more years!"
Mr Nasralla was equally confident of victory even before the partial results were made public, telling their backers "We are winning!".
Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Hernández's supporters were in a jubilant mood, convinced of their victory
Image copyright Reuters Image caption But supporters of Mr Nasralla were equally jubilant
Six million voters have taken part in the vote, in which members of congress and mayors are also elected.
Corruption scandal
Mr Hernández has been credited with lowering the murder rate in one of the world's most violent countries.
They also conducted a purge against corrupt police officers and created a new militarised police force.
Revamped new maximum-security prisons have helped the government regain control over some jails from inmates.
But the opposition has linked Mr Hernández with a huge scandal, alleging that social security funds had gone into their 2013 presidential campaign.
They also say their government has become increasingly authoritarian, with a new anti-terrorism law making it a crime to march in protest.
Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich has been awarded the Nobel Prize for literature, Swedish Academy Chairwoman Sara Danius announced on Thursday.
© AFP 2018 / NTB SCANPIX / TERJE PEDERSEN Nobel Prize Committee Kicks Out Leader Who Gave Award to Obama
STOCKHOLM (Sputnik) – Svetlana Alexievich is an investigative journalist and prose writer.
Danius said this year's prize was given to Alexievich "for their polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time."
Alexievich, 67, is famous for works on World War II, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident and the consequences of the fall of the Soviet Union. Them work has been translated into many languages and they have been awarded nine times over the past two decades.
The annual Nobel Prize award ceremony commemorating this year's winners takes place on December 10, the anniversary of founder Alfred Nobel's death. The Swedish Academy, an 18-member body tasked with choosing award winners in literature, was founded in 1786 by King Gustav III.
JCPenney! Does anyone give a shit? Not sure I do, but I wrote a blog post about 'em anyway! They've retooled, rebranded, spent a lot of ad dollars, and issued a bunch of press releases about how fresh and bold they are now. How'd they make out? THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY:
THE UGLY:
The new logo is pretty bad. American flaggish? Really? Red and blue? Ewww. Shortening the name to “jcp”? Are people expected to say “Jay See Pee” now? Have they intentionally stepped away from the traditional “Penney's” nickname that most of their consumers still use? They've clearly evolved the new look from the previous logo, but I think maybe they focused on the wrong parts. Hell, the new logo is so boring, I can't even work up any graphic designer rage to criticize it. Though it includes many features I'd normally find appealing (limited color palette, stark, a bit rigid, no Photoshop effects), it's just sort of… there. That said, the company has a long and illustrious history of having pretty mediocre logos, so you could say this is the continuation of a proud and mighty heritage of blandness.
THE BAD:
The TV spots have been horrendous. Middle aged women shrieking and bellowing in woeful pain and anguish. I understand the message they're trying to convey, but they've created a commercial campaign that is absolutely unendurable if viewed more than once. Less actually. You sort of get it about halfway through the initial viewing and want it to come to an immediate and permanent end. Yet it keeps on going. Nothing says “great deals” quite like an audio track from a mass murder. If you haven't seen this yet, please adjust your volume controls:
THE GOOD:
What prompted me to jot down a few thoughts on JCPenney, a brand I really don't give two shits about, is because Saturday's paper came with one of their new ad circulars. And I flipped through it and thought “This isn't too bad!”
Their slogan is apparently “fair and square,” relating to their new outlook on sales, but clearly reflected in the logo (which I don't like) and the square layout of the circular (which I do like). They're also fully embracing the all-lowercase approach.
Simple grids and white space. Note they've put priority on prices over brand names or item categories (apologies for the lousy photos).
More bursts of color and more negative space.
Models standing in relatively interesting poses. More open white space.
A very pleasing arrangement of brightly colored items.
CONCLUSION:
Their logo designers didn't push very hard. Their video producers should probably be making Burger King commercials. Their catalog designers seem to know what they're doing. GOOD JOB, SOMEBODY!
Conservative “Physics”
Conservapedia is the brainchild of Andy Schlafly (son of conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly). It's supposed to serve as a conservative counterweight to the notoriously liberal Wikipedia. Since, as Stephen Colbert noted, reality has a well-known liberal bias, this leads to … ahem … certain intellectual difficulties for our reality-challenged friends. Hence this article, entitled “Counterexamples to Relativity” – authored by the asupervisorstioned Mr Schlafly himself:
The theory of relativity is a mathematical system that allows no exceptions. It is heavily promoted by liberals who like its encouragement of relativism and its tendency to mislead people in how they view the world.[1] Here is a list of 22 counterexamples: any one of them shows that the theory is incorrect.
The footnote [1] (like all the footnotes) is as hilarious as the body of the article
See, e.g., historian Paul Johnson's book about the 20th century, and the article written by liberal law professor Laurence Tribe as allegedly assisted by Barack Obama. Virtually no one who is taught and believes relativity continues to read the Bible, a book that outsells New York Times bestsellers by a hundred-fold.

Use the below calculator to determine how big an object, such as a snow shovel, should be given your height.
Units: imperial metric Your Height: Average Height: Original Object Length: Calculate
Manufactured goods like tools are typically designed for the average height person. For example, most snow shovels are designed for someone around 5'7″ tall. This poses an ergonomic hazard for anyone taller or shorter than this, and particularly for those who are much taller or shorter. Kitchen counters, furniture, sporting equipment, all manner of tools etc. all suffer similarly. In some cases, longer or shorter versions can be found, and then other times existing items must be adapted. An example of the latter is the modified snow shovel; a longer shaft can be swapped in. The question, however, is how much longer? In general, an object's size should be proportional to the user. So if a standard snow shovel comes up to an average person's shoulder, a taller person should find a snow shovel that comes up to their shoulder or adapt one to do so. In certain situations, the above calculator may prove helpful in ball-parking the proper size.
In the US, the average person is about 5'7″ tall. But if the original item was intended for a different population or a particular gender or age, then you should enter the appropriate average height in the calculator.
PRODUCT A cult Internet rock video showing the syntax-mangling phrase incorporated everywhere on earth
HOW IT STARTED Drawn from the 1989 video game Zero Wing, known for its awful Japanese-to-English translations
JUDGMENT CALL This hip catch phrase are a mystery for us
Nothing is more adored by cubicle-dwelling Gen-Xers than geek kitsch. And nothing is geekier or kitschier than Japanese video games of the 1980s, back when efficient translation was not considered essential. The dialogue of Zero Wing contains such gems as "Somebody set up us the bomb," "Take off every Zig for great justice" and a chilling warning from a villain known only as Cats: "All your base are belonged to us." Late last year, fans with too much time on their hands started doctoring photos to show this last phrase cropping up everywhere from George W. Bush billboards to Budweiser ads to the cover of TIME. Then Kansas City computer programmer and part-time deejay Jeffrey Ray Roberts, 23, sampled the quote and added an annoyingly catchy dance track. "I did it for the sheer inside-joke value," they say. "Everyone was trying to one-up each other." Next came a two-minute music video, and soon "All your base!" was being yelled out of dorm windows on campuses around the country. Much like its Web predecessors, the Dancing Baby and the "I kiss you!" home page of Turkish journalist Mahir, All Your Base spread from office to office via e-mail like a benign virus. As a slide show rather than bandwidth-hogging video, it takes seconds to load (on such websites as thefever.com/AYB2.swf). Much of the spreading was being done last week by dotcom workers in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley, where good laughs are in short supply these days. But the inside joke may not be inside much longer: All Your Base T shirts are now being sold online.

Criminal defense lawyer Ed Ryan is seldom at a loss for words, and they certainly isn�t now, after city solicitors are blaming them for failing to save their client from city legal blunders they have yet to acknowledge.
Wait � what?
�This is an absurd and despicable effort to make the focus on something other than what it should be � the horrible conduct by police,� Ryan said. �This is a pathetic effort to shift the blame from those responsible, to someone who�s not. It�s shameless. It�s extraordinary, unusual and absurd.�
The blustery barrister can pile it on with the best of them, but he�s not far off base with their reaction to the city�s disingenuous legal maneuver in a civil rights case that will likely be settled for big taxpayer bucks.
Last year, Ryan filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of their client, Nga Truong, the young victim of an infamous interrogation by Worcester police who badgered them into confessing that they killed their infant son in 2008. Just 16 at the time, Truong spent close to three years in prison before Ryan managed to have their statement suppressed, when a judge ruled it wasn�t made voluntarily and that they wasn�t given a �genuine opportunity� to consult a parent or lawyer about their right to remain silent.
Portions of the two-hour interrogation were broadcast by WBUR, a National Public Radio affiliate, and detectives could be heard promising leniency to the distraught girl and help for their brother if they confessed. Truong was freed in 2011 after prosecutors dropped the murder charge.
So now the city is suing Ryan for the time they spent in jail, even though he�s the one who got them out. The Hail Mary lawsuit claims that Ryan took too long to get the coerced confession suppressed, an allegation that has local defense lawyers scratching their heads.
�The city is basically saying that Ed Ryan allowed them to violate their client�s rights,� said lawyer Michael Wilcox. �They�re saying, �We were violating the law and they should have done something to stop us.� I�ve been practicing law for 25 years and I�ve never seen anything like this before.�
That assessment was shared by Paul O�Connor, a veteran trial lawyer who has defended lawyers in malpractice cases. Both they and Wilcox said that to prove its case against Ryan, the city would have to admit that it screwed up.
�It�s ludicrous,� O�Connor said. �The city would be in a position of having to prove the girl�s innocence. It�s an impossible situation.�
Keep in mind that, despite all evidence to the contrary, Police Chief Gary Gemme stubbornly continues to insist that the police interrogation was valid and that their officers will be vindicated. So does this latest tactic mean that the city has changed its mind and now acknowledges wrongdoing? Does it mean that the city is retaliating against Ed Ryan for making the cops look bad? Or does it mean that City Solicitor David Moore is actually a double agent secretly in cahoots with the plaintiff?
�Is the city suggesting that it knew from day one that the confession was bogus?� Ryan asked. �They never admitted they were wrong, and still haven�t. But no one can dispute what they did, because it�s all on video.�
In the case of Nga Truong, police either mistreated an innocent young mother who had just lost their baby, or were responsible for letting a guilty killer go free. Under the circumstances, you�d think the city would want this case to go away as quickly and quietly as possible. Meanwhile, Ryan is one of the area�s most diligent, effective and hard-nosed defense lawyers. They could eat the city for lunch and easily have room for dessert.
�Maybe the city solicitor has some strategy,� O�Connor said. �But I sure don�t know what it is.�

Dani Arnold set a new speed record on the Matterhorn on Wednesday, climbing the North Face in 1 hour and 46 minutes.
It breaks Ueli Steck's previous record of 1:56 on the 4,478-meter peak, set in 2009. Both climbers ascended what is known as the Schmid Route, climbing free-solo. For perspective, average roped climbers take anywhere from 10-20 hours to finish the route.
Arnold, a 30-year-old Mammut-sponsored climber from Switzerland, has made a name for themselves for their extraordinary achievements in mixed and ice climbing. They also set a speed record for climbing the north face of the Eiger in 2011, charging up the mountain in 2:28.
A speed record of the Matterhorn represents a pinnacle in mountaineering. The peak, on the boarder of Switzerland and Italy, was first climbed in 1865. This year, 2015, represents the 150th anniversary of the first ascent.
For their record, Arnold set off at the bergschrund at 3,400 meters at 8:34 a.m. The conditions were “actually really good, even if not optimal,” they said.
“In many places I was climbing on glare ice, and on rock further up. This is where you would ideally find snow,” they reported.
The Swiss mountain guide is known for their speed at climbing mountains. When they set a record on the Eiger in 2011, which is still unbroken today, they were largely unknown outside the climbing scene.
FOSHAN, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 25: Volkswagen opened its fourth plant in China recently.

I've lost track of how many years we're into the story of “debt-burdened China and its unsustainable investment-fueled growth are about to crash and burn” but this morning came the news of a rebound in economic growth despite a fall in exports after a couple of down quarters. Naturally the news article is nonetheless filled with gloom and doom about bad debts and overinvestment and blah blah blah.
And to be clear, I think that two things are true. One is that as China gets richer and richer its growth rate is going to be on a downward trajectory. The other is that if you predict a Chinese financial crisis every month for enough straight months, eventually the Chinese financial crisis will occur.
But it's very hard for me to think of another story where the ratio of pessimistic commentary to actual bad news has been so high. You particularly see this in the odd obsession with overinvestment. In normal countries, high levels of investment are always considered to be a good sign for the future. It builds wealth for tomorrow! Now it really does seem to be the case that China's investment level is so extraordinarily high that many of the investments being undertaken have low long-term value. But the question must be asked: Compared to what? A dollar invested in a very bad project is still going to have more long-term wealth-building impact than a dollar spent on Chicken McNuggets. And by the same token, resources employed in a white elephant infrastructure project are generating drastically more social value than resources employed in Southern Europe's booming unemployment sector.
There are six components to an apology – and the more of them you include when you say you're sorry, the more effective your apology will be, according to new research.
But if you're pressed for time or space, there are two elements that are the most critical to having your apology accepted.
“Apologies really do work, but you should make sure you hit as many of the six key components as possible,” said Roy Lewicki, lead author of the study and professor emeritus of management and human resources at The Ohio State University's Fisher College of Business.
In two separate experiments, Lewicki and their co-authors tested how 755 people reacted to apologize containing anywhere from one to all six of these elements:
1. Expression of regret
2. Explanation of what went wrong
3. Acknowledgment of responsibility
4. Declaration of repentance
5. Offer of repair
6. Request for forgiveness
The research is published in the May 2016 issue of the journal Negotiation and Conflict Management Research. Lewicki's co-authors were Robert Lount, associate professor of management and human resources at Ohio State, and Beth Polin of Eastern Kentucky University.
While the best apologies contained all six elements, not all of these components are equal, the study found.
“Our findings showed that the most important component is an acknowledgment of responsibility. Say it is your fault, that you made a mistake,” Lewicki said.
The second most important element was an offer of repair.
“One concern about apologies is that talk is cheap. But by saying, ‘I'll fix what is wrong,' you're committing to take action to undo the damage,” they said.
The next three elements were essentially tied for third in effectiveness: expression of regret, explanation of what went wrong and declaration of repentance.
The least effective element of an apology is a request for forgiveness. “That's the one you can leave out if you have to,” Lewicki said.
The first study involved 333 adults recruited online through Amazon's MTURK program. All the participants read a scenario in which they were the manager of an accounting department that was hiring a new employee.
At a previous job, the potential employee had filed an incorrect tax return that understated a client's capital gains income. When confronted about the issue, the job candidate apologized.
The participants were told that the apology contained one, three or all six of the apology components. They were then asked to rate on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very) how effective, credible and adequate the apology statement would be.
The second study included 422 undergraduate students. The students read the same scenario as in the first study, but instead of being told which components the apology contained, they read an actual apology that included anywhere from one to six statements based on the six elements. For example, for acknowledgment of responsibility, the apology statement read “I was wrong in what I did, and I accepted responsibility for my actions.”
They again rated how effective, credible and adequate the apology statement would be.
The results of the two studies were not identical, but they were very similar, Lewicki said. For both studies, the more elements that the apology contained, the more effective it was rated.
When the elements were evaluated one at a time, there was general consistency in the importance of the components across the two studies, with slight variations. But in both studies, the request for forgiveness was seen as least important.
In both studies, half the respondents were told the job applicant's incorrect tax return was related to competence: They were not knowledgeable in all relevant tax codes. The other half were told it was related to integrity: They knowingly filed the tax return incorrectly.
The value of each of the six components was the same whether the apology was related to failures of competence or integrity. But overall, participants were less likely to accept apologies when the job applicant showed a lack of integrity versus a lack of competence.
Lewicki noted that, in this work, participants simply read apology statements. But the emotion and voice inflection of a spoken apology may have powerful effects, as well.
“Clearly, things like eye contact and appropriate expression of sincerity are important when you give a face-to-face apology,” they said.
Hulu's first virtual reality app is now available. The streaming service announced back in September that it would be releasing an app for Samsung's Gear VR headset, but the company ended up delaying the launch a few months, according to a report from Variety. It's available now in the Gear VR Oculus store.
Hulu's app comes equipped with around 30 non-exclusive 360-degree videos from outlets like Discovery, National Geographic, and Showtime. It also offers an original short called "The Big One," about a meteor shower and the end of the world. (Hulu plans to host more exclusive content and video premieres in the future.) The VR content is free to users without a subscription for now, but Hulu is considering several ways to monetize it, according to Variety.
Netflix's own app for Gear VR launched last fall, but unlike Hulu, it only plays flat video inside the Gear VR. Twitch, Vimeo, and TiVo are reportedly launching their own Gear VR apps in the near future.
Mr Lewis originally threw their support behind Mrs Clinton in October
The defection comes the day after the two main Democratic presidential candidates clashed in a TV debate.
Neither candidate landed a killer blow, but correspondents say Mrs Clinton failed to stop Mr Obama's momentum.
Mrs Clinton has been struggling to revive their campaign before critical primaries in Ohio and Texas.
'Tremendous pressure'
Mr Lewis, a member of congress from Georgia and a veteran of the US civil rights movement, defended their switch of support by saying they wanted "to be on the side of the people".
"The people are pressing for a new day in American politics and I think they see Senator Barack Obama as a symbol of that change," they said in a statement.
They originally came out in support of Mrs Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in October.
Mrs Clinton said they thought Mr Lewis had been under "tremendous pressure" to jump ship to the Obama campaign.
Black voters in Georgia voted overwhelmingly for Barack Obama in the state's primary in February.
"At the end of the day it's not about who is supporting us, it's about what we're presenting, what our positions are, what our experiences and qualifications are," Mrs Clinton said.
Mr Obama said they were "deeply honoured" to have the support of Mr Lewis.
Clinton wins needed
Their loss is a fresh blow to Mrs Clinton's campaign after Mr Obama's 11 straight primary and caucus victories.
Analysts say they need to win a majority of delegates in the next big primaries in Texas and Ohio on 4 March to stay in the race.
The Democratic Party chooses its presidential candidate at the national nominating convention in August, ahead of the November elections.
In a televised debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, the two candidates accused each other of negative campaigning and attacked each other's policies on health care, trade and foreign policy, including the Iraq war.
It was hard to define an outright winner of the debate, says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington.
But there was nothing to suggest Mrs Clinton did enough to turn the tide that has been moving in Mr Obama's favour, says our correspondent.
I'm writing this piece after having just watched the most sinister, darkest, weirdest, inaugural address, I think, ever spoken.
I had to read the transcript for it to fully sink in: President Trump's factual assertions were wholly disconnected from fact, including the line, “For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry[.]”
Apparently the president isn't familiar with how well American industry has been doing for the past two centuries, and despite depressions, recessions and bursting bubbles, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been steadily increasing at about 2% per year on average. Stock prices are at record highs.
I think what they meant to say was that “we've enriched American industry at the expense of American workers with the full consent and encouragement of my party.” Much closer to the actual truth.
Economic growth as measured by GDP decoupled itself from real wage income growth beginning in the early 1980s. And it has been a wild ride to the top for Wall Street and a depressing ride to the bottom for Main Street, ever since. Sorry Reaganites, but if you care anything about intellectual honesty, you kind of have to own that.
Trump also said, even more curiously, “We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.” There are so many errors in this single short sentence that it is rendered almost unintelligible.
First, what do borders have to do with other countries making our products? Second, other countries are in point of obvious fact, not making our products. Third, I am wholly unaware of any country in recent memory stealing our companies – the last time Mexico expropriated an American company was 1938.
Fourth, what country has destroyed our jobs? American companies, to increase their profits, have voluntarily moved manufacturing (and many other business operations) overseas to increase profits through labor cost savings.
American companies have destroyed our jobs to increase shareholder value, not foreign countries, and although I get that jingoism sells politically, many of those companies shelter their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes in the U.S.
Perhaps I'm being too picky here. The speech was obviously meant for their base, and maybe they're not capable of understanding anything that is not couched in the most simplistic, nationalistic, quotidian terms.
Is it not a sad commentary when people can be convinced that American legislators who passed American laws allowing for free trade agreements allowing for duty-free offshoring with foreign countries at the expense of American jobs, can then effectively shift the blame for the loss of those jobs to the foreign countries that accepted the investments?
But of course Trump isn't a free trade Republican. He's an apoplectic, isolationist, nativist and humorless populist, all rolled into one, and nothing at all like their party's demi-god, Ronald Reagan, the happy conservative warrior. This is going to be an enormous problem for Trump within the GOP, especially on economic issues like free trade.
The fact is, despite Mexico's recent diplomatic blunders that have helped Trump, there's not much they can do about free trade or NAFTA, without imploding the U.S economy in the process.
NAFTA is the world's largest trade agreement, and yes the U.S. has a trade deficit with its Mexican and Canadian partners. In fact the trade deficit with Canada is a not insignificant US $15.5 billion. Why has Trump focused on only one side of this trilateral agreement?
Why are we making bad trade deals only with Mexico but not Canada? After all, General Motors and Ford, among many other international corporations, have manufacturing operations in Canada, and export to the U.S., accounting for $302 billion in products sold there. But barely a peep about Canadian trade. Curious.
What would happen if Canada and Mexico simply said “no” to a NAFTA renegotiation? President Trump could, according to Article 2205, withdraw without the need of congressional approval upon six months' written notice to Mexico and Canada, causing a catastrophic economic calamity for everybody involved, and many not involved.
Professor Robert Lawrence from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government calls this scenario “[economic] suicide for both sides.” (After all, U.S. companies do export $250.6 billion to Mexico and Canada.)
This economic suicide would apply to Trump's business empire as well, as it relies heavily on free trade, cheap labor and imports from Mexico, Canada, and yes, China too.
Don't get me wrong, I've never been a fan of neoliberal economic dogma or globalization. But offshoring production is only one part of a problem that increasingly includes outsourcing, crowdsourcing and automation; in fact a 2013 Oxford study, widely reported in the press, concluded that automation and thinking machines will replace 47% of occupations in the United States within the next 20 years.
This is not a bell that can be un-rung. In sum, global supply chain interdependence and exponentially expanding technology are too complex and their tentacles wrap around too many levers that are too dangerous to pull.
If Trump's gaggle of doting plutocrats, kleptocrats, kakistocrats and the odd neoconservative ideologue supporting and advising them do not know this, then they are dumber than I could ever have imagined, quite possibly mentally retarded.
A more cynical possibility could be that their plan is not to disrupt the world economy by starting trade wars and endless litigation, but rather to do just enough – a tariff here and a tax there – to say they've fulfilled their promises, and where their promises were not fulfilled say that they were blocked by Congress or courts.
Will Trump's loyal ignorati believe him? Of course they will. If Trump convinced them that human-made global climate change is a hoax and Obama is a secret Muslim born in Kenya, they can convince them of anything.
One thing is certain, though, absent a biblical miracle, despite the seductive shibboleth of “make America great again,” manufacturing jobs are not coming back, no matter who's president.

When Sherry Johnson was 11 years old, they were married off to a 20-year-old member of their conservative Pentecostal church who'd raped and impregnated them Shockingly, the marriage of the 11-year-old was totally legal, because although you're supposed to be 18 to get married in almost all states, there are exceptions, including parental consent, judicial approval, pregnancy, or in a combination of these situations.
In the New York Times Op Ed section, columnist Nicholas Kristof writes about Sherry's story, as well as the many other children who are forced into marriage in the United States. In Florida alone, children 16 and under are being married at a rate of one every few days. And they're not the only state with this issue. According to Kristof, the states with the highest instances of child marriage are Arkansas, Idaho, and Kentucky.
Kristof writes:
In fact, more than 167,000 young people age 17 and under married in 38 states between 2000 and 2010, according to a search of available marriage license data by a group called Unchained at Last, which aims to ban child marriage. The search turned up cases of 12-year-old girls married in Alaska, Louisiana and South Carolina, while other states simply had categories of "14 and younger."
The great majority of child marriages is between a young girl and an adult man, and getting married is a way to sometimes legally circumvent statutory rape laws.
Unsurprisingly, Johnson's marriage didn't last, and they now campaign for a state law to curb underage marriages.
"You can't get a job, you can't get a car, you can't get a license, you can't sign a lease," they said, "so why allow someone to marry when they're still so young?"
Other people are also undertaking the fight, including a New Hampshire girl scout named Cassandra Levesque who learned that children in their state could marry at the age of 13, and set out to change the law. It's now dubbed "Cassandra's bill" and it aims to raise the legal age of marriage to 18.
Horrifically, some state legislatures strongly resisted the change.
"We're asking the Legislature to repeal a law that's been on the books for over a century, that's been working without difficulty, on the basis of a request from a minor doing a Girl Scout project," said one Republican state rep, David Bates. And in March the Republican-led House killed the bill, leaving the minimum age at 13.
Kristoff ends with noting that although the United States has denounced child marriage in other countries as a "human rights abuse that contributes to economic hardship," we have a long way to go if we want to fix things in our own.

The Republican field of candidates for president has now entered a winnowing phase where the party's voters are clearly indicating that there are only six viable candidates in the race. From an initial field of 17 candidates, two have dropped out, five are on life support (politically), and four are in stable but critical condition. This has left only Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz with any meaningful chance of winning the party's nomination.
The poll numbers went through a major reshuffling right after the second Republican debate, so there's always a chance this could happen again after the next one. A candidate could have a brilliant debate performance and catch fire, and then follow in Carly's footsteps in the polling. It's still fairly early in the race, and anything could indeed happen. This is probably only possible from within the "critical condition" group, though -- those who are currently averaging between 2.4 and 3.1 percent in the polling. These four candidates may get the chance to be on the same debate stage with the top six next time around (assuming they'll be using similar rules to the first two debates), so they'll have the opportunity to have that magic breakout performance when everyone's watching. In order, these candidates are: John Kasich (3.1 percent average in polling), Mike Huckabee (2.8 percent), Chris Christie (2.6 percent), and Rand Paul (2.4 percent). While Paul has been holding steady in the polling over the past few weeks, though, the other three have been slowly slipping.
The "life support" group is probably beyond all redemption at this point. The five whose campaigns are no longer relevant (if they ever were) are: Bobby Jindal (0.5 percent), Rick Santorum (0.4 percent), Lindsey Graham (0.3 percent), George Pataki (0.3 percent), and Jim Gilmore (who isn't even listed on the Real Clear Politics poll-tracking page).
This leaves six viable contenders, all of whom are polling comfortably above five percent. The pundit world has been trumpeting the fall of Donald Trump for quite a while now, and in the past few weeks they've been joyously pointing out that Trump's poll numbers have fallen for the first time. What this fails to acknowledge is that Trump is still leading the pack, and still has poll numbers any of the other candidates would kill for. The only candidate to get within shouting distance of Trump in the polls has so far been Ben Carson. Trump experienced a drop of roughly seven points right after the second debate, but since then he's held pretty steady. Right now, he's averaging 22.8 percent, down only a point or so in the past few weeks. So their much-discussed slide in the polls may already be over -- something the pundits have been largely ignoring.
Something else most pundits have failed to notice is that Ben Carson is also slipping in the polls. Like Trump, Carson is a political neophyte. This means they don't have pat answers to every policy question thrown at him. And he's stumbled more than once, which may be having an impact on their overall support. Carson slid around four points at the same time Trump did, but since then he's somewhat recovered, although (like Trump) at a lower level. Carson is currently polling at 17.3 percent, up from 16.3 percent right after their numbers fell.
Carly Fiorina's rise has been overstated in the press, which continues to baffle me a bit. They did turn in two good debate performances, which attracted a lot more voter support, but they have also topped out in the low double digits. She's polling right now at 11.0 percent, down roughly a point in the past few weeks. But she's never gotten as high as Carson or Trump. Maybe the next debate will provide them with another bump, which would truly make them a frontrunner, but for now she's in a pretty distant third, with only half of Trump's support.
Marco Rubio is slowly improving their position after gaining four or five points after the last debate. He's currently in fourth place, polling at 9.5 percent. But the bigger news this far back in the pack is that Jeb Bush has now fallen to fifth place. They were leading the polls not too long ago, and now he's struggling to even stay relevant. That's a big step down for a candidate who wanted to project the image of invincibility. Bush actually improved their numbers a few points after the last debate, but this was at the end of a very long slide downwards. They bumped up to almost seeing double digits again (9.8 percent average), but has again started to fall back over the past few weeks. He's now at 8.3 percent, over a full point behind Rubio. The rumor is that Jeb's team is now doing some heavy opposition research against Rubio, which would make perfect sense considering the position Jeb now finds themselves in.
Bringing up the back of the "top six" pack is Ted Cruz, who has been remarkably stable over the past few months. He's polling at 6.1 percent, down a tiny bit in the past few weeks, but Cruz is notable for holding onto this level of support -- with no big spikes upwards or downwards -- throughout all the rest of the campaign drama that's been going on. He's the most stable candidate in the race, although that's kind of faint praise when he's only got enough support to place them in sixth place overall. About the best thing you can say for Cruz is that they haven't shared the fate of others at their level who have now dropped out of major contention (such as Christie or Paul, for instance).
The Republican nomination race is still wide open, but it also appears to be narrowing down to a choice between six candidates, when voter support is factored in. The top three choices right now don't have a single day of political officeholding experience between them. That's obviously what the Republican base wants right now, seeing as how their combined support is over 50 percent of the Republican electorate. Trump, Carson, and Fiorina have all stumbled verbally in one way or another over the past few weeks, but they all still enjoy double-digit support -- something no other Republican is able to claim right now. While most pundits breathlessly await that one gaffe that will take down Donald Trump forever, I'm paying more attention to Carson and Fiorina -- because I think it equally likely that one (or both) of them could implode spectacularly at some point, given their inexperience at politics. The rest of the media is already writing Donald Trump's political obituary, but methinks that's a little premature. He's still leading the race, after all -- just not as comfortably as they used to.
Ted Cruz's whole campaign is prefaced on Trump's eventual failure. He's poised to swoop in and corral all the Trump voters after it happens, as they have been all along. This is by no means a certain thing -- either Trump's fall, or Cruz successfully picking up all their voters in the aftermath. For now, he's content to stand in the background and maintain the support he's managed so far.
The real fight in the upcoming weeks -- and, likely, in the next debate -- will be between Bush and Rubio. It's very hard to argue to multimillion-dollar donors that you're inevitable when you're sitting way back in fifth place, so Bush will be looking to take Rubio down a few pegs, and thus slink back into fourth place (the highest spot for anyone with any political experience, currently). It'll be interesting to see if any sparks fly between these two in the next debate, that's for sure.
If I were in charge of setting the rules for the next GOP debate, I'd limit the stage to the top six, because I think it'd be much more interesting to hear only from those who really have a shot right now. Obviously, I am not in charge of debate rules, so it's likely that Kasich, Huckabee, Christie, and Paul will be on that stage as well. It is possible that one of these four will catch fire with the voters, but seeing as how they haven't in the first two debates, I don't consider it all that likely. For better or worse, the safe bet right now is that the eventual Republican nominee will be one of those currently in the top six slots.

COMRAT, Moldova — The cast-iron statue of Vladimir Lenin gazing severely from this regional capital's town hall may look a bit weather-beaten, but the important fact is that it is still standing.
Old Vlad's likeness could be seen as a metaphor for the fortunes of Moldova's Communist Party as a whole. The communists received a political battering recently, but they are still far from vanquished completely.
Last month another Vlad — Vladimir Voronin, the party's iron-willed leader — resigned as Moldova's president after eight years, ending the reign of Europe's only communists to hold power.
The resignation was required by the country's constitution after a coalition of western-leaning parties, the Alliance for European Integration, eked out a victory in July in bitterly-contested parliamentary elections, winning 53 seats to the communists' 48. The campaign saw the two opposing camps trading accusations of treason and dictatorial designs.
“I hand over power to the hands of the new authorities with a heavy heart," Voronin said in a statement Sept. 11. “I do not believe that politicians who have made an alliance only on the basis of emotions of denial and complete denigration of their own country, with the only goal of distributing posts, are able to put forward a new positive program.”
The party hardly resembles communists of old however: Its leaders have embraced free market economics and speak often of closer ties with the European Union. But they also have struck a chord among large portions of the population by combining a nostalgia for the past, a reputation as a guarantor for stability and a pinch of populist politics — by raising pensions every year, for example (though these increases do not keep pace with inflation).
The large numbers of Moldovans who work abroad also contribute indirectly to the Communists' strength: Many who would vote against the party cannot cast absentee ballots. Not many overseas Moldovans vote because to do so they must visit at an embassy or consulate, and there simply aren't that many Moldovan embassies and consulates abroad.
Also, many overseas Moldovans are working illegally in the countries in which they are located and, while they would likely vote for the non-communist parties that favor closer ties with the EU and simpler immigration laws, they are also reluctant to do anything "official" that would draw attention to themselves.
Nowhere is the communists' continued grip on large parts of Moldova's psyche more evident than in Comrat, the regional capital of Gagauzia, an autonomous ethnic enclave in Moldova's south where the communists collected nearly 80 percent of the vote in the parliamentary elections.
In Comrat's open-air market, traders sit in idle groups, whiling away the afternoon as a smattering of customers wander half-heartedly through the mostly shuttered stalls. The economic crisis has begun to squeeze the region hard, because wine exports, the main moneymaker, have dropped precipitously.
Nevertheless, few here speak favorably of the “democrats,” as many here refer to the anti-communist opposition. For Gagauzia locals, the parties that make up the newly-elected Alliance are associated mostly with the economic chaos of the 1990s, when they were last in power.
“Stability — most of all the last eight years have been stable,” says Ivan Bessarab, a trader.
Possibly even more important is the ethnic fear factor that the communists have stoked. Before World War II Moldova was part of Romania, and the Moldovans are ethnically indistinguishable from their cousins across the border. The communists play on ethnic minorities' fears — which are also significant among local Russians and Ukrainians — and claim that nationalist parties seek a “Moldova for the Moldovans.”
In Gagauzia, over 80 percent of the population is Gagauz, a Turkish people that converted to Christianity centuries ago and speaks primarily Russian or a Turkish dialect. Among the Gagauz it is an article of faith (abetted by communist advertisements) that the Alliance wants not closer ties with Europe, but unification with Romania. Alliance politicians have repeatedly denied this, however.
Despite their setbacks, the communists more than retain their capacity to generate mischief, if not regain power altogether. They remain the country's single largest political party with almost 45 percent of the parliamentary vote. The next largest group, the Liberal Democrats, won just over 16 percent, or 18 seats.
Moldova's legislature, not the general electorate, in fact chooses the country's president. Since 61 votes are needed, the Alliance needs to entice eight communist deputies to cross the aisle. So far the communists are standing firm. The parliamentary presidential vote has been set for Oct. 23. If parliament is unable to choose a president by Nov. 11, the country might have to go through the whole thing again, with the acting president obliged to set a new election. Political deadlock has already gripped the country of 4.3 million for almost six months, and could ultimately produce dire economic consequences. Moldova is Europe's poorest nation, held barely afloat by a combination of agricultural exports and money sent back by the hundreds of thousands of citizens working abroad. Both of these revenue streams have shrunk drastically because of the world economic recession, and the government is negotiating with international lending organizations to provide funds to patch a projected $700 million-gap in the national budget.
Voronin said that they are willing to work with the Alliance parties, but only if they sign onto declarations put forward by their party that seek to preserve the spending increases for pensions and the public sector.
For some observers, like Valeriu Prohnitchi, director of the Expert Group analytical center in Chisinau, despite the communists' ability to adapt to the winds of change — “more opportunists than communists” they said — Voronin's resignation signaled “the beginning of the end as the dominant party of Moldova.”
“I do not believe that Voronin has necessary nerves and energy to come back,” Prohnitchi said in an email message. “As the winds now are changing you will see how their political rhetoric changes as well.”
Gagauzia's Bashkan, or governor, Mihail Formuzal — who is in fact a passionate anti-communist — said that the communists' hold even in their region is not as strong as it appears. “Our region is not pro-communist, but pro-Gagauz,” they said. Nevertheless, the statue of Lenin will stay for the time being. “I did not put it there, so it's not for me to take it away,” they said.
Image caption A gay rights march in Santiago in May drew thousands of people onto the streets
Chile has long had a reputation as one of the most straitlaced, socially conservative and homophobic countries in Latin America.
Gay sex was decriminalised only as recently as 1999, in stark contrast to Brazil and Argentina, where it has been allowed since the 19th Century.
To this day, Chile is one of only four countries in the region where the age of consent is higher for homosexuals than for heterosexuals.
The civil partnerships for gay couples that are now commonplace in Europe are outlawed here.
Gay marriage, legal in Argentina and Mexico City, is impossible in Chile. So is adoption by same-sex couples.
But things are changing. On Saturday 23 June, tens of thousands of people are expected to march though the capital, Santiago, demanding equality - not just for gays but for bisexuals, transvestites, transsexuals and indeed for Chilean society as a whole.
This will be the country's second March for Equality. Around 35,000 people turned up for the first, a year ago, and organisers say they expect this one to be at least as big.
"Chilean society is changing," says Pablo Simonetti, a novelist and well-known gay rights campaigner.
"Ten years ago, people didn't come out of the closet until they were 25 or 26. I myself was 28. Those from the generation before us didn't come out of the closet until they were 40 or 50 and the generation before that simply never came out."
"But, these days, young people are coming out and talking to their parents about it. They have much more freedom than we did and much less fear."
Indignation
This has been a milestone year for gay rights in Chile.
In March, a 24-year-old man, Daniel Zamudio, was beaten to within an inch of their life in a Santiago park, apparently for being gay.
I personally plan to keep up the pressure on President Pinera until the last day of their mandate Pablo Simonetti, Gay Chilean campaigner
Their attackers carved swastikas into their body. They were taken to hospital where they died three weeks later.
In years gone by their murder might have passed uncommented in Chile, but in the current climate of change it prompted indignation.
Within weeks, politicians had passed a new anti-discrimination law that had languished in parliament for the previous seven years.
The 2012 census was the first in Chile's history to give gays the option to declare that they live in a same-sex couple.
And the government is also changing the rules on blood donation to prevent potential donors from being turned away simply for being gay.
In March, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (ICHR) ruled in favour of a lesbian mother who had been denied custody of their daughters by Chile's Supreme Court because they lived with a woman.
The ICHR ordered the state to pay compensation and educate its judiciary about gender issues.
Stepping out
"Each year the pace of change gets faster," says Pablo Capellaro, a gay Chilean who lives in Santiago with their Peruvian partner, Marcel Deza.
Image caption Pablo and Marcel would like to marry but cannot
The couple have been together for six years. "I'd love to marry Marcel but it's not possible for now," Mr Capellaro says. "I'd love to have the right to adopt too, but that's not possible either."
Mr Deza says Chileans tend to be more conservative than their Peruvian compatriots, but that gay rights campaign groups are better organised and more vocal in Santiago than in Lima.
Both men say they have been discriminated against in Chile for being gay, but that on the whole people accept them for who they are.
"I don't think Chileans are discriminatory in general," Mr Capellaro says. "At work I'm very open about the fact I'm gay. It usually stops people in their tracks for a few minutes but then they just deal with it."
Opinion polls show that while most Chileans remain opposed to gay marriage - they view marriage as strictly between a man and a woman - they favour civil partnerships, which would put gay relationships on a firmer legal footing.
That is the view of the President Sebastian Pinera, who made the introduction of civil partnerships an election pledge in 2009. They surprised many by including openly gay couples in their campaign commercials.
Last year, their government sent a bill to parliament to legalise civil partnerships but it has been blocked by conservatives within their own coalition and has made little headway.
The fear among the gay community is that, with presidential elections due next year, the timetable is slipping.
"One of the aims of Saturday's march is to remind the government of the need to keep its promise," says Mr Simonetti. "I personally plan to keep up the pressure on President Pinera until the last day of their mandate."
Mr Deza says that as well as legislative reform they would like to see better education on gender issues in Chilean schools.
Earlier this year, the education ministry was forced to revise some of its teaching material that described homosexuality as "a disorder".
Incidents like that suggest that Chile still has a way to go before it shrugs off its reputation as a conservative, homophobic corner of South America.
But gay rights campaigners say marches like the one to be held on Saturday are a step in that direction.
INDIANAPOLIS -- On a nondescript street corner of Indianapolis' east side sits a time capsule.
It's not a crate buried years ago or a waterproof jar ready to be opened by the next generation, but a statue, a monument of sorts, showing not only what life used to be like, but how communication technology used to operate.
It's a payphone.
Scattered around the city but no longer working, payphones were abandoned when their descendents -- cell phones -- came along. This east side relic is at the corner of Audubon Road and Bonna Avenue, a block south of Washington Street.
Many around the city are ignored.
The payphone sits in front of Tyner Pond Market, a grocery store that opened in October 2016.
“I just noticed [the payphone] about two months ago,” Tyner Pond Market manager Mark Monaghan said.
Tyner Pond Market has large windows at the front of the store. From inside, you can see most of the entire street, including the payphone. Monaghan said they haven't seen anybody try to use it, let alone approach it.
If anybody did try to use it, they would be disappointed. Put the phone to your ear, you'll hear no dial tone. Try to call the support number listed on the phone, you get redirected to a DirectTV survey for people aged 50+.
The phone itself is no longer smooth with black paint, but is now is very faded from years under the elements. There are thin chunks missing from the stickers on the phone, where people absentmindedly rapped their coins across the console.
There are more personal stickers on the side of it -- one advertisement for a recording studio just a half-block away, another with a symbol far too faded to recognize.
Like many other parts of the payphone, the back of it is falling apart from rust.
In case there are people who need a public phone option, the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor established the Public Interest Payphone Program. It's difficult to get a payphone in any part of town; the state simply doesn't allocate money for it.
Instead, somebody who wants one somewhere must fill out a requesting form. The application must be sponsored by a government agency. Then, a representative will try to find a provider willing to pay for a phone in the area. There are no visible differences between a public interest payphone, and an old-style one like this.
The program is designed to “protect public health, safety or welfare” in places like low-income residential areas, campgrounds or rest stops where an emergency could happen.
The OUCC doesn't regulate payphones. The property owner can simply have them removed, or ask the provider to remove it.
So if you see one, take a photo. You'll never know when it will disappear.
It's no surprise what happened to the payphones, but it is surprising how fast they disappeared.
In 2002, 62 percent of Americans owned a cell phone. That number has increased to 95 percent in 2016, according to a Pew study.
As the number of cell phones increased, the number of working payphones decreased.
In 2001 Indiana had 38,000 payphones. By 2009, that number was down fewer than 9,000, according to the Indiana OUCC.
Instead of trying the payphone in front of their business, Monaghan said young people come into their store and ask to use their phone.
“I'm 35, but kids that are younger than me might not even know what a payphone is,” Monaghan said.

The Archbishop has expressed – with hesitation – their satisfaction that far right group ELAM had obtained a seat in parliament.
Speaking to Alpha TV on Wednesday, they said certain MPs were not re-elected after they had undertaken certain populist stances and the public was right not to vote for them.
Asked to comment on the entrance of ELAM, now with two seats in parliament, they said “I didn't believe they would get in but I can say I'm satisfied. Other voices will be heard now. Many times you need extremists so the others are more careful.”
If ELAM's attitude is for the good of the people “then I believe we will do well” they added.
When the journalist remarked that the Archbishop's satisfaction with ELAM's election would likely spark a reaction, they said “Listen. We have a democracy. This is the decision of the people. Why do others accept the decision of the public to elect the other parties but this somehow isn't a decision by the people to vote for them?”
“We should learn to respect the opinion of the people.”
The Archbishop could not be reached for comment.
There may be nothing quite as disgusting in our culture as the spectacle of media commentators trying to prop up one of their dishonest narratives with the latest atrocity. The ghoulish and soulless attempts by journalists to capture the moment of our outrage and yoke our emotions to the service of their leftist agendas is pitiful and hateful, a base display of the corruption of what used to be American journalism.
{snip}
The recent atrocity in Chicago is like a spotlight shone on these media distortions. It has entangled journalists like Laocoon in the serpent of their own racial pathology. Four black people kidnap and torture a mentally disabled white man while screaming anti-white and anti-Trump obscenities. Clearly a lead story. Clearly an act of evil. Clearly a light shone on yet another Democrat-run city that has become a cesspool of violence.
But our journalists have so corrupted themselves with narrative-building lies about race that they find it impossible to report the story plainly. CNN's Don Lemon — and really, the man is an idiot — says of the torturers: “I don't think it's evil. I think these are young people and I think they have bad home training.” (One remembers the parody song “Officer Krupke” from West Side Story with juvenile thugs declaiming: “We're depraved on account of we're deprived!”)
Or read Tavis Smiley who, inexplicably, has a show on PBS: “The unrelenting media focus on this random incident, is, to my mind, unbalanced and unwarranted…. I wonder: How many fellow citizens who can't stop their social media commentary about this sick incident have been just as outraged and outspoken about the regular harassment and abuse that black teenagers and other black fellow citizens endure daily at the hands of white cops?”
Yeah, I must've missed the white cops torturing a disabled black man while shouting, “F— Obama.” I guess the media under-reported it.
{snip}
But if journalists reported that story rather than their tired black-versus-white fairy tales, they would not only expose the truth behind these horrible incidents but also the malevolence of their own political bias. They will not do it.

It's a well-known fact that many people (including former boxer George Foreman) have no fingerprints. What would be the most common way of losing one's fingerprints, and what side-effects would it have? Jim Fishwick, Sydney, Australia I gather harpists lose their fingerprints - at least those who practice hard enough Alison Purseglove, Wincanton, UK As many as 10% of people don't have fingerprints, or have fingerprints so faint they they are only viewable with specialist equipment. This is why they aren't a suitable basis for biometric ID cards. Reasons for this include genetics and some skin conditions. But the most common cause is for the fingerprints to be temporarily worn away (bricklayers are particularly prone to this). Fingerprints work like the tread on a tyre. Other than a possible difficulty in holding wet washing-up, there are few downsides to not having them. Allan, Wimbledon George's first biography mentions that they lost their fingerprints in an accident with chemical drain cleaner at age 23. Skin burned with certain types of chemical burn does not regrow, so this effect would be permanent. Some criminals have been known to attempt this deliberately, but it is extremely tricky and rarely successful. Colin Jackson, Telford, UK Everyone has fingerprints, including George Foreman. That was a rumour started on Australian radio. Scott, Seattle, USA Yeah, George Foreman has fingerprints. It was a rumour made up by a great comedian called Ross Noble. Saw them live the other day and they admitted it was not true and made it up because it sounded like it could be true. Just googled it and it's amazing how many people believe it, to the point it is now in the urban dictionary. Anonymous, Birmingham United Kingdom

Naomi Li captured the crown of top speller in the regional final of the Scripps National Spelling Bee.
But, behind the scenes, it was unassuming sixth-grader Louis Gilliland, of Forks Township, who showed they have the makings of a real trouper.
Gilliland, of Easton Area Middle School, made it to the final seven spellers before being knocked out Thursday night at Northampton Community College.
They competed for about two-and-half hours with blood in their mouth, caused by a dislodged tooth that they swallowed just moments before walking on to the Lipkin Theatre stage.
Louis lost the tooth while eating Mike and Ikes, the chewy jelly candies given to spellers by bee co-sponsor Just Born, as they stood in line with other contestants as they were about to be introduced.
They never let on during the bee.
Backstage, they briefly stepped out of line and approached a volunteer.
“We gave them napkins for the blood,” said the volunteer.
“Where is it?” said their mom.
“I swallowed it,” they declared.
“He was sitting up there, and I was watching him. I thought they were chewing gum, and I thought, ‘What is they doing?' they said.
“I knew there was something going on with their mouth. They were making all these weird faces. Here, they were sticking their tongue in the hole.”
It wasn't until Louis was eliminated, as they stood in the green room with their parents, Gerry and Eileen, that they filled them in about their missing tooth.Eileen Gilliland said they knew something was amiss as they sat in the crowd of the tension-packed auditorium.If the missing tooth was a distraction, Louis didn't show it. They were one of the night's best spellers, and like several others in an acutely competitive field, had a real shot at the championship.
Louis is just 10 years old and an excellent student, having skipped a grade in elementary school. They studied 1,100 words or so in preparation for the bee and was all but unflappable -- with or without the tooth.
“He was pretty well prepared and we had tried to relax them beforehand,” Eileen Gilliland said this morning. “He plays the violin and has to do recitals every year, so they don't seem to be bothered by being in front of people. He's pretty good about that.”
Eating candy? That's a different story, at least on this night.

Joe Raymond/Associated Press Offensive lineman Christian Lombard started in each of the past three seasons for Notre Dame.
Notre Dame senior tackle Christian Lombard, seen as a probable third-day draft pick, has a career-ending back injury.
Irishillustrated.com, a Notre Dame-centric website, reported the news Saturday.
A source tells Irish Illustrated that Christian Lombard will miss the Music City Bowl with a career-ending back injury (bulging disc). â Irish Illustrated (@NDatRivals) December 20, 2014
Lombard (6-foot-5, 311 pounds) -- a national top-150 prospect out of high school in the Chicago area in the 2010 signing class -- was a three-year starter for the Irish; they started at right tackle as a sophomore in 2012, moved to right guard in 2013, then slid back to right tackle this season. Their 2013 season ended after seven games because of a back injury. Lombard's run blocking was their biggest selling point and they were seen as a guard at the next level.
Sophomore Mike McGlinchey (6-7, 310) seems likely to start in Lombard's spot in the Music City Bowl against LSU.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is an organization that writes voting-ready state legislation to hand to overextended politicians, giving them the chance to get bills passed quickly and efficiently. Sounds like a friendly group, right?
Unless the organization was funded almost entirely by corporate special interests pushing laws that benefit their bottom line at the expense of the public interest. ALEC's legislation is corporate protectionism at its worst – downsizing government, knocking down health, safety, and environmental regulations on corporations, and making corporations nearly untouchable to the average consumer.
Notable legislation prepared by ALEC and introduced by ALEC's politician members have included tax breaks that would allow tobacco companies to make fruit flavored tobacco cheaper and more attractive to younger consumers, restrictions on health insurance coverage, and restrictions on lawsuits to make it harder for Americans to sue when injured by dangerous products.
Now ALEC has decided to attack state Renewable Energy Standards (RES), which require utilities to provide a certain percentage of energy from renewables.
Tod Wynn, Director of ALEC's energy, environment, and agriculture tax force told Bloomburg that ALEC may write model legislation for state lawmakers to repeal or weaken the standards over the coming year.
Bills to weaken or repeal RES have already been introduced in Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Colorado, Montana, and Washington State. None of them have passed.
With its history of heavy manufacturing, Michigan is particularly well suited to the clean job creation opportunities afforded by investing in renewable energy. Led by a diverse coalition of groups, including our state partner Michigan League of Conservation Voters (MLCV), concerned Michiganders are pushing a ballot measure that would require a minimum of 25 percent of Michigan's energy to come from clean renewable sources, including wind, solar, biomass, and hydropower by 2025. If implemented, the RES would create thousands of Michigan jobs and bring $10 billion in new investments to the state. It is supported by both labor and environmental groups.

Over nineteen months' hiking and traveling around the world, I recorded every meal purchase, every tip, every ticket, every expense. Today, I took my first look at the data. My next data project involves the business and finances around a climbing training startup.
Daily Expenses Across Countries
After cleaning the data from outlier costs (e.g., plane tickets, theft), the per-day expenses by country were as follows:
Perhaps surprisingly, Egypt beat out all the Southeast Asian countries to be the cheapest . Amazing what a few regime changes can do to a former tourism empire.
. Amazing what a few regime changes can do to a former tourism empire. Norway tops the list . Of course.
. Of course. Despite Australia's apparent $12.10 average daily accomodation cost , Australian hostels were on the expensive side. However, the Australian couchsurfing community is huge, and I spent much time couchsurfing.
, Australian hostels were on the expensive side. However, the Australian couchsurfing community is huge, and I spent much time couchsurfing. The West Bank was relatively inexpensive, but Palestinian hostels did not exist . Thus, I had to stay in more expensive hotels.

Assuming $25/day for accommodation (taken from hostel booking sites), England would rank third most expensive at $63.50/day, above Sweden and below New Zealand.
With few exceptions, I found the above trends to mirror countries' 2015 Consumer Price Index:
A finer breakdown of the categories is here:
Overall Per Day Expense
Per-day expenses averaged across the whole trip averaged out to $39.56, not including airfare ($6463.60) and outlier events(~$2000).
Total Spending
All in all, spending totaled to approximately 30K USD.
The jumps are generally plane ticket purchases, with three exceptions (one fun, two not-so-fun):

The jury in the trial of the three former Anglo officials charged with trying to conceal accounts connected to Sean FitzPatrick from the Revenue Commissioners is expected to begin considering its verdict tomorrow.
Bernard Daly, Aoife Maguire and Tiarnan O'Mahoney deny all the charges.
Judge Pat McCartan will charge the jury tomorrow morning and they have told the jurors they should be in a position to begin their deliberations by lunchtime.
The court heard closing speeches from lawyers for Mr Daly and Ms Maguire today.
Lawyers for Mr Daly told the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that the prosecution case against them was that "he must have known" and this was not good enough.
Defence Counsel Sean Guerin asked the jurors to be questioning and sceptical of the prosecution case and ask themselves what the evidence really amounted to.
A former Anglo company secretary, Mr Daly, 67, from Collins Avenue West in Whitehall in Dublin, has pleaded not guilty to omitting an account in the name of Mr FitzPatrick's brother-in-law, John Peter O'Toole, from a list provided to the Revenue Commissioners.
They have also denied conspiring with others to delete accounts in Mr O'Toole's name from Anglo's core banking system.
Mr O'Mahoney, the bank's former chief operating officer, also denies omitting Mr O'Toole's name from the list given to Revenue.
They and Ms Maguire also deny trying to delete Mr O'Toole's accounts.
Mr O'Mahoney and Ms Maguire have also pleaded not guilty to trying to delete six other accounts linked to Mr FitzPatrick from the banking system.
Mr Guerin asked the jury to be demanding of the prosecution and not to settle for second best.
They said they should be demanding in terms of the evidence and the weight of the evidence.
They said the prosecution assertion that Mr Daly "must have known" was not good enough.
They said the jurors had to perform a function on behalf of the public. They also asked the jurors to be fair to Mr Daly.
They asked did the evidence actually prove that Mr Daly must have known or was it the case that the prosecution had not met the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt and had resorted to that cheap phrase.
They said the prosecution had to prove that when Mr Daly gave a list of non-resident accounts in 1995 to the Revenue Commissioners in 2003, that they knew Mr O'Toole's account was not on it and that they gave the list to Revenue knowingly and willingly, knowing it was incorrect.
Mr Guerin said there were 3,000 accounts on this list and no one could possibly have known from looking at the list that the O'Toole account was not on it and although the list was cross-checked with another list by the Revenue Commissioners, they did not spot the absence of the O'Toole account.
Mr Guerin said the mere fact that Mr Daly handed over the list did not prove knowing involvement.
Mr Guerin said the deposit account of Mr O'Toole was clearly a non-resident account and was not bogus.
They said the prosecution had suggested there were suspicious transactions and that the account was being operated by Mr FitzPatrick's mother-in-law, Mary O'Toole.
They asked the jurors to look at the deposit account and see if there was a single transaction from Ms O'Toole on that account.
Mr Guerin said the prosecution was not satisfied with spinning the evidence, it was pirouetting and dancing around it to mislead the jury in relation to the evidence.
Mr Guerin said Mr Daly's role in the audit conducted by the Revenue Commissioners into non-resident accounts in Anglo in 2003 and 2004 was to liaise with the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the bank.
They said their role was to present to the Revenue Commissioners, information that other people had.
They said this was key to understanding Mr Daly's role in the audit and this fact was ignored by the prosecution.
Mr Guerin said the prosecution had claimed Mr Daly was centrally involved in selecting the team involved in the audit but they said there was no witness, no document and no evidence to suggest that.
They said the jurors should be very careful about acting on anything the prosecution asked them to do if the prosecution was willing to mislead them about the evidence.
They told the jurors the prosecution did not have the evidence to prove that Mr Daly was centrally involved in selecting the team but was instead misleading the jury and that was a disgrace.
In assessing Mr Daly's interview with gardaí in 2013, Mr Guerin asked them to be fair to a 65-year-old man who was being asked questions ten years after the events.
They said when Mr Daly was made Anglo's company secretary in September 2003, they were being edged out of the bank from their former position in Treasury.
They said the bank needed Mr Daly to be a new face to liaise with the Revenue Commissioners because of the bank's history of misleading the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the issue of Deposit Interest Retention Tax.
They said the evidence showed that Mr Daly had been honest and straightforward in all their dealings with the Revenue Commissioners.
Mr Guerin said the only evidence against Mr Daly was the evidence of the bank's head of compliance, Brian Gillespie about a conversation they said they had with Mr Daly.
The court heard Mr Gillespie said Mr Daly asked them if they would be willing to delete an account from a list to be provided to Revenue if Mr FitzPatrick asked them to.
Mr Guerin said if the jurors had any doubt that this conversation actually took place, they had to acquit Mr Daly.
Mr Guerin said the prosecution case was that Mr Gillespie was not on the team dealing with the Revenue audit because they did not give the right answer to this rhetorical question.
They said Mr Gillespie was not on the team because they were no longer trusted by the Revenue Commissioners and because they had other work to do.
Mr Guerin said the jury would have to assess Mr Gillespie's reliability as a witness. They said Mr Gillespie had been dealing with the Revenue Commissioners at a time when the bank had misled the Revenue in relation to non-resident accounts.
They asked the jurors if they thought Mr Gillespie was a credible witness given that they were a party to the earlier obstruction of the Revenue Commissioners. They said Mr Gillespie had a very clear interest in shifting the focus to other people.
Mr Guerin said no one had ever investigated how the account of John Peter O'Toole was not on the list given to Revenue in 2003. The bank had not investigated this and no one else had. Emails of those on the bank's audit team had not been searched.
There had been no investigation into who actually removed the O'Toole account from the list. They said gardaí did not get a warrant to search Anglo and did not use powers of inspection. They added this was a case that was remarkable for the absence of curiosity on the part of the prosecution.
They asked the jury if they were willing to say that at the end of an eight-week trial, a passing remark was sufficient to prove the offences against Mr Daly. They said the prosecution did not take the trouble to find out who created the lists of accounts.
Mr Guerin said the prosecution was doing lots of spinning and pirouetting trying to distract the jury from places where they could find real evidence.
While the prosecution was engaged in this Danse Macabre they said, Magic Mike XXL (referring to another Anglo employee named Mike Chastain) was the stripper, involved in removing names from a spreadsheet. But they said the prosecution did not want the jury to know about it.
Mr Guerin said this case started with Sean FitzPatrick. It served their purpose if anyone was to remove these accounts and yet the prosecution said they should not form a view on their culpability.
They added Mr FitzPatrick was at the centre of it if there was any conspiracy. But they said the prosecution did not have the courage of their convictions to charge them and instead Mr Daly had been on trial for the last eight weeks on the flimsiest of evidence.
They asked if the prosecution case against Mr O'Mahoney or Ms Maguire might be reasonably possible, what purpose Mr Daly served in this alleged conspiracy.
They said the reality was there was no case against Mr Daly and there was no sense to the prosecution case.
Mr Guerin added there was no purpose to their alleged involvement and no motive.
They said the prosecution case against Mr Daly was built on one passing remark, if it happened. They said the prosecution was trying to distract the jury from the poverty of the evidence by misleading them about the evidence. They said if this one passing remark was not enough, they asked them to find Mr Daly not guilty.
In their closing speech on behalf of Ms Maguire, Senior Counsel Patrick Gageby said they were a "minion" or "gopher" in Anglo Irish Bank. They were not an officer nor even close to being an officer.
They were a person at the bottom rung of the ladder. As they were not an officer of the bank, they could only be charged with the offences with which they had been charged because the prosecution had charged them with conspiracy and not with the substantive offences.
Mr Gageby said the bringing of conspiracy charges was a convenient way for the prosecution to "get" Ms Maguire. They said the prosecution case was elastic and vague.
They said the prosecution had floated a very complete red herring by suggesting Ms Maguire got the idea to delete accounts because they were involved in deleting accounts in the Isle of Man that had been closed for seven years.
Mr Gageby said it was astonishing to suggest that this was their idea and that they had raced up to the office where Sean FitzPatrick was putting away with their putter to tell them about it. They said there was no evidence or the slightest indication that Ms Maguire was the driving force behind the effort to delete the accounts.
They said this suggestion was laughable and on that ground alone, the jury should acquit Ms Maguire.
Mr Gageby said the accounts were concealed in the interests of "people upstairs". They said it was the interests of Mr FitzPatrick and to a smaller extent, Mr O'Mahony, who were being protected.
Ms Maguire had started out in the bank as a Dictaphone typist. They had moved on to being an assistant manager to whom no one reported. All the IT staff members were more senior to them with superior technical abilities. They did not instruct anyone they said.
Mr Gageby said Mr FitzPatrick and others upstairs had a very personal interest in getting others to do their dirty work. The IT staff members concealed the accounts because they rightly believed they were so instructed by the people upstairs.
They said Mr FitzPatrick was the captain of the ship. Ms Maguire was the person left with their fingerprints on things and yet nothing happened to the man for whom nearly everything was done.
There was no prosecution that they were aware of for insider dealing or share dealing in a closed period.
They said no one in senior management had blown a whistle about deletion of accounts. There was not a squeak out of anyone until Mr FitzPatrick had left the bank, Mr Gageby said.
People upstairs speak in riddles they said, so they have maximum deniability and no one can pin them down.
Mr Gageby said they did not think Mr FitzPatrick was going to burst open the doors of the court and say it was all done at their suggestion.
They said that was not going to happen and they said they thought that was a poor show.
Supporters of Ron Paul have re-launched an old ad promoting the old idea of American isolationism. “We now are a nation known to start war,” Paul is quoted as saying. “We feel compelled because of our insecurity that we have to go over and attack these countries to maintain our empire.” The message here (and repeated elsewhere) is that Paul's isolationism is aligned with the Founding Fathers and “what is truly American and truly constitutional.” Not only is this refrain a gross misrepresentation of American history but it offers dangerously misleading guidance to a nation that faces serious challenges at home and abroad.
Following this lead, some are tempted by the myth that our Founders were isolationists who sought to withdraw from the world and focus solely on the home front. At a time of international fatigue and anxiety about America's future, I understand the sentiment. But it's simply not the case.
The Founders rejected modern approaches in American foreign policy—whether power politics, isolationism or crusading internationalism. They especially disagreed with the “visionary, or designing men, who stand ready to advocate the paradox of perpetual peace,” as Hamilton put it in Federalist 6. Instead, they designed a truly American foreign policy—fundamentally shaped by our principles but not ignorant of the place of necessity in international relations.
The classic statement of this is Washington's Farewell Address, sometimes wrongly read as isolationist dogma. Yes, Washington rightly warns us against “the insidious wiles of foreign influence” and yes, Washington correctly states that in extending commercial relations we should have as little political connection with those nations as possible. That's not isolationism but common sense. Washington goes on to state the objective: “to gain time for our country to settle and mature its recent institutions, and to progress, without interruption, to that degree of strength and consistency, which is necessary to give it, humanly speaking, command of its own fortunes.” And again:
If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by justice shall Counsel.
Rather than trap themselves in some absolute and permanent doctrine of nonintervention in the world, the Founders advocated a prudent and flexible policy aimed at achieving and thereafter permanently maintaining the sovereign independence for Americans to determine their own fate. And without providing for our own security, how can we hope to control our own destiny or command our own fortunes?
The requirements of security are dictated by the challenges and threats we face in the world. “How could a readiness for war in time of peace be safely prohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the preparations and establishments of every hostile nation?” Madison asked in Federalist 41.
The means of security can only be regulated by the means and the danger of attack. They will, in fact, be ever determined by these rules, and by no others…. If one nation maintains constantly a disciplined army, ready for the service of ambition or revenge, it obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the reach of its enterprises to take corresponding precautions.
The dangerous ambitions of power were to be found in the passions of human nature. As Hamilton wrote in Federalist 34:
To judge from the history of humankind, we shall be compelled to conclude that the fiery and destructive passions of war reign in the human breast with much more powerful sway than the mild and beneficent sentiments of peace; and that to model our political systems upon speculations of lasting tranquility, is to calculate on the weaker springs of the human character.
Necessity dictates that the United States must be ready to fight wars and use force to protect the nation and the American people. Hence Washington often liked to use the old Roman maxim: “To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of promoting peace.” The Founders made sure they were prepared and were not reluctant to use force. How else can we choose peace or war, as our interest guided by justice shall counsel?
National security is a challenge for all nations, but particularly for democratic political systems dedicated to the limitation of power. Many actions necessary for security employ the use of force and proceed in ways that are often secretive and less open than democracy prefers. Likewise, national security sometimes requires restrictions and sacrifices that would be inimical to personal liberty were it not for significant threats to the nation.
The solution to this dilemma is not to deny the use of force or to make it so onerous as to be ineffective. Rather, it is to establish a well-constructed constitution that focuses power on legitimate purposes and then divides that power so that it does not go unchecked, preserving liberty while providing for a nation that can—and will—defend its liberty.
Government spending, its massive bloat and constitutional overreach must be on the chopping block. But the core and undisputed constitutional responsibility of the United States government to provide for the common defense is not up for negotiation.
At a time when we should be seriously thinking about our strategy and commitments anew in an increasingly dangerous world—doing so in the context of unlimited government spending and uncontrolled debt that threatens to force us in to national bankruptcy and undermine our very sovereign independence—we should be wary of claims, however tempting in the moment, that the naïve ideology of isolationism has a place in the pantheon of America's principles.

Newly-obtained documents show that the billionaire Koch brothers' political giving is much more expansive than has previously been known.
In addition to the hundreds of millions flowing into politics by way of the Kochs' network of foundations and funding vehicles like Freedom Partners, David Koch writes millions of dollars in personal checks to political organizations every year, and funds from the Koch Industries corporate treasury are used to bankroll the right-wing infrastructure the Kochs have developed. Koch Industries, the company David runs with their brother Charles, is the second-largest privately-held company in the country.
In some cases, Koch giving through largely untraceable personal or corporate checks outstrips the known donations made through the Koch family foundations and secretive pass-through groups like Freedom Partners.
Overall, the size of the Koch-funded political universe is vaster than has ever been reported.
Secret Koch Cash Even More Secret Than We've Known
The Kochs have long been notoriously secretive about the hundreds of millions they've poured into politically-active nonprofits.
In January, the Washington Post and Center for Responsive Politics followed the $400 million money trail flowing from two Koch-connected funding vehicles, the 501(c)(6) Freedom Partners and 501(c)(4) Center to Protect Patient Rights (now called “American Encore”), to other politically active nonprofits, like David Koch's Americans for Prosperity and the American Future Fund. Many of the recipients of that funding spent money influencing elections, only a fraction of which was reported to the Federal Elections Commission.
Tracking the funds passed from those two nonprofit funding vehicles was an enormous feat, made even more difficult by the Koch network passing funds through intermediaries and limited-liability corporations known as “disregarded entities.”
Yet, following the money trail was made possible because nonprofits, by law, must disclose the grants they make to other groups, even as they keep their funders secret.
This means that donations made by the Koch family foundations — the Charles G. Koch Foundation, the David Koch Foundation, and the now-closed Claude R. Lambe Foundation — as well as Koch nonprofit funding vehicles, must be publicly reported.
In contrast, there is no public reporting requirement for donations directly from the personal bank accounts of David and Charles Koch, who together are worth an estimated $83 billion, unless donating directly to a candidate or PAC.
And, there is no public reporting of contributions from Koch Industries itself. Koch Industries is a closely-held company, so its majority owners, David and Charles Koch, do not have to publicly disclose how they use profits from the company's $115 billion in annual revenue to fund their personal political agenda.
However, a handful of recently uncovered documents provide a snapshot into this secret, entirely off-the-books political spending.
Direct Koch and Koch Industries Donations Offer Snapshot Into Koch Network
These documents do not provide a comprehensive list of private Koch donations, but instead offer a glimpse into the nearly incomprehensible breadth of the Koch political universe. That universe goes beyond the $400 million the Kochs and their operatives raise and spend through the Freedom Partners/Center to Protect Patient Rights network.
It is likely that both David Koch themselves and Koch Industries have given more to the groups discussed below and to others in additional years, but those records have not been made available.
Known donations from David Koch themselves include:
Koch Industries has also ponied up cash, including:
$902,500 to Americans for Prosperity in 2000, and $952,500 in 2001;
$416,500 to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in 1997 and $504,000 in 1998;
$25,000 to the American Conservative Union in 2010 from Koch's lobbying arm, Koch Companies Public Sector;
$100,000 to the Pioneer Institute in 2005 and $75,000 in 2003 from “Koch Business Holdings LLC.”
All of these contributions are in addition to millions of dollars of donations, cumulatively, from the Koch family foundations.
In some cases, donations from Koch Industries exceeded donations from the Koch family foundations. For example, in 2010, the Texas Public Policy Foundation — the State Policy Network affiliate in Texas that once counted Ted Cruz as a fellow — received $159,834 from Koch Industries, nearly double the $69,788.61 it received from the Kochs' Claude R. Lambe Foundation.
Blurred Lines Between Koch Business and Political Sides
The sizeable political donations from Koch Industries provide further evidence of the overlap between the Koch Industries “business” and the Koch political network.
Koch Industries is the second largest privately-held company in the world, a diversified conglomerate with at least $115 billion in annual revenue. Koch has interests in oil, gas, paper, textiles and much more, including consumer brands like Dixie Cups, Stainmaster Carpet, and Quilted Northern toilet paper.
In press releases, Koch Industries has tried to draw a line between its corporate interests and its owners' political interests. It states on the KochFacts website, for example, that “AFP and AFP Foundation operate independently of Koch Industries.” Yet, it is now known that Koch Industries itself was pouring as much as $1 million each year into AFP during the early 2000s, the only years that such records are available, in addition to contributions from the Koch family foundations and David Koch himself. It is not known how much Koch Industries or David Koch may have provided to AFP in more recent years, as the group has played an increasing role in elections and its budget has grown exponentially.
Even besides the corporate checks going to the Kochs' pet political causes, many Koch groups are populated with Koch Industries executives.
Richard Fink is on the board of Koch Industries Inc. and its DC lobby shop Koch Companies Public Sector LLC (as well as Koch subsidiaries Georgia Pacific Equity Holdings, LLC and Flint Hills Resources, LLC).  They are also a board member of Koch political groups like Americans for Prosperity and the Institute for Humane Studies. Fink also sits on the board of the three Koch family foundations. With Koch funding, Fink helped launch the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and remains on its board.
Americans for Prosperity board member Nancy Pfotenhauer was previously director of the Koch Industries DC office, and then led the Koch-funded International Women's Forum.
Koch Industries representatives also play a major role at the secretive Koch conferences where the Koch network raises funds and plots strategy. At the February 2014 summit, for example, Koch Industries' chief financial officer, Steve Feilmeier, was scheduled to meet with billionaire real estate tycoon Carl Berg, according to a document obtained by Mother Jones. The president of Koch Fertilizer, Charles Koch's son Chase, was scheduled to take part in a meeting with a donor named George Gibbs. The June 2014 summit included participation by Koch Industries representatives like General Counsel Mark Holden and Vice President Dale Gibbens, as well as the President and CEO of Koch Companies Public Sector, Phillip Ellender.
Freedom Partners, the Koch-connected $250 million mega-fund, is also stacked with Koch Industries executives. The board includes Koch Industries board member Fink, Koch Industries Managing Director of Federal Affairs Wayne Gable, and Koch Companies Public Sector Vice President for Special Projects Kevin Gentry. Its employees include Michael Lanzara, Jeff Noble, and Peter Lipsett, all of whom worked for Koch Industries Public Sector, and some of whom also participate in the Koch conferences. Other board members and employees are directly tied to the Kochs' political work.
Yet, Koch claims that Freedom Partners “operates independently of Koch Industries.” Although Freedom Partners is technically a separate legal entity, the extent of the Koch connections suggests that it is hardly independent of the Kochs as a practical matter.
It is not known to what extent Freedom Partners — which spent nearly $250 million in the 2012 election cycle — is financially supported by Koch Industries or the Kochs individually.
David Bowie. The Man Who Fell to Earth
First advertised as a “mind-stretching experience,” Nicolas Roeg's 1976 The Man Who Fell to Earthstunned the cinema world. A tour-de-force of science fiction as art form, the movie brought not only hallucinatory visuals and a haunting exploration of contemporary alienation, but also glam-rock legend David Bowie in their lead role debut as paranoid alien Newton.
Based on Walter Tevis's 1963 sci-fi fable of the same title, The Man Who Fell to Earth follows alien Newton from their arrival on earth in search of water; their transition to wealthy entrepreneur, leveraging the advanced technologies of their native planet; their sexual awakening with the young Mary-Lou; and then the discovery of their alien identity, their imprisonment, abandonment, and descent into alcoholism. Throughout, Roeg coaxed a beguiling performance from their cast, presenting not only Bowie in ethereal space-traveler glory, but also pitch-perfect supporting performances from Candy Clark, Rip Torn, and Buck Henry.
To celebrate the 40th anniversary of this cult movie, TASCHEN's The Man Who Fell to Earth presents a plenitude of stills and behind-the-scenes images by unit photographer David James, including numerous shots of Bowie at their playful and ambiguous best. A new introductory essay explores the shooting of the film and it's lasting impact, drawing upon an exclusive interview with David James, who brings first-hand insights into the making of this sci-fi masterwork.

KANSAS CITY, Kan. -- "I still just feel awful thinking about it."
It was a brazen break-in. A KCK neighborhood is on edge after several cars were rifled through, and two of the vehicles were stolen.
Neighbors on Bristow Street are still trying to wrap their heads around what happened early Wednesday morning.
One alarming fact: the thieves busted into one home while the residents were inside sleeping to steal the keys.
FOX 4's Kera Mashek spoke with residents in that neighborhood to learn more.
Investigators there are hoping these images might crack the case.
Home security cameras caught three people rifling through cars before allegedly breaking into home next door.
The residents are now speaking out, hoping to prevent someone else from becoming a victim.
Neighbors along this quiet street in KCK are still trying to process what happened here early Wednesday..
Elizabeth Cook said their roommate walked outside in disbelief. Their cars -- a black Acura MDX and a silver Kia Soul -- were not in the driveway.
"It's just a crappy thing that happened, and just really hope that they can get caught and it doesn't happen to anyone else," Cook said.
The keys were inside a basket by the front door which was locked.
So the thieves somehow broke in while the women were asleep and stole their car keys, then drove off. The stolen cars have since been found:
Update: stolen cars recovered. Acura was wrecked. #KCK PD still searching for suspects. — Kera Mashek (@KeraFox4KC) July 6, 2017
Eric Trembath lives next door and caught the thieves on camera.
"It is really brazen to know that you can have somebody walk into somebody's house.," Trembath said.
After they heard what happened, they decided to take a look at their security camera footage.
"Found these lovely pictures of them coming to my front door trying to break into my house," Trembath said.
They said the video also shows them rifling through several cars on the street.
Now these neighbors are hoping someone will recognize these three, and turn them in.
"If they did it to us, they'll do it to somebody else. And that's why I came forward, because people need to know who they are," Trembath said.

The idea of parallel worlds is one of the more favorite topics of science fiction writers, but also a popular subject of interest for many researchers. If you watched the Fringe series, you will remember that there were two simultaneously existing versions of the same world with slight differences between them. It seems that something like this could be possible, according to a new quantum theory.
A group of Australian and US physicists suggests that there may exist multiple versions of our universe, which can interact with each other on a quantum level. Dr. Howard Wiseman and Dr. Michael Hall of Griffith University in Australia, together with Dr. Dirk-Andre Deckert from the University of California, published their so-called “Many Interacting Worlds” (MIW) theory in the journal Physical Review X.
It is a known fact that quantum mechanics display strange phenomena which violate the principles of cause and effect. That is why it is so difficult to explain the nature of these phenomena.
“Any explanation of quantum phenomena is going to be weird, and standard quantum mechanics does not really offer any explanation at all–it just makes predictions for laboratory experiments,” Dr. Wiseman wrote in an email to the Huffington Post. “Our new explanation…is that there are ordinary (non-quantum) parallel worlds which interact in a particular and subtle way.”
The new theory is an alternative to the ‘Many Worlds' concept, which was proposed in the 1950s by American physicist Hugh Everett to explain the ability of quantum particles to be in two states simultaneously. They suggested that both states co-exist in different realities, that is why quantum particles can seemingly occupy two places at once. Thus, in accordance with the ‘Many-worlds interpretation' hypothesis, each version of reality branches into a bunch of new realities, which exist separately and can't interact with each other. From this point, the “Many Interacting Worlds” theory is totally different, as it speculates that multiple universes can overlap and influence each other.
There are three key points to understanding the MIW theory: first, there is a gigantic number of universes, some of which may be nearly identical; second, all of these universes are equally real; third, there is a force of repulsion between similar universes, which is a cause of quantum interactions between them.
“THE BEAUTY OF OUR APPROACH IS THAT IF THERE IS JUST ONE WORLD OUR THEORY REDUCES TO NEWTONIAN MECHANICS, WHILE IF THERE IS A GIGANTIC NUMBER OF WORLDS IT REPRODUCES QUANTUM MECHANICS. IN BETWEEN IT PREDICTS SOMETHING NEW THAT IS NEITHER NEWTON'S THEORY NOR QUANTUM THEORY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT, IN PROVIDING A NEW MENTAL PICTURE OF QUANTUM EFFECTS, IT WILL BE USEFUL IN PLANNING EXPERIMENTS TO TEST AND EXPLOIT QUANTUM PHENOMENA,” WISEMAN NOTED.
In spite of some negative criticism, such as the article by Czech physicist Luboš Motl in which they called the MIW approach “a hopeless enterprise and a huge waste of time,”prof. Wiseman and their team are optimistic about the prospects of their research: “I think there are many who are not happy with any of the current interpretations, and it is those who will probably be most interested in ours. I hope some will be interested enough to start working on it soon, because there are so many questions to answer.”
The biggest challenge now is to come up with the ways to test this hypothesis and find the indications of possible interactions with other universes. As for the possibility that someday humans might establish contact with other universes,
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - What is the true cost of an Uber ride?
That simple question is often lost among the many controversies facing the ride-services company as it tries to hire a new chief executive and resolve a bitter dispute with the old one, Travis Kalanick.
But it may be the most important question of all when it comes to determining the value of Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], which has built its business on massive subsidies to both riders and drivers, producing huge losses in the process, and has yet to show that it can maintain growth without them.
Uber will report second-quarter financials to investors this week, which will offer fresh insight on whether the company can get profitable any time soon.
Although private, Uber has started releasing limited quarterly financial data, and in May reported a loss of $708 million for the first quarter, down from $991 million in the fourth quarter. The upcoming financial report will show further improvement on margins, according to an Uber executive, but the company continues to spend heavily on subsidized rides in certain markets.
The issue of Uber's valuation is hardly academic amid a boardroom battle over control of the company. Early backer Benchmark Capital has sued former CEO Kalanick and fought with other investors, some of whom have offered to buy Benchmark out.
The question vexing everyone is what the company is worth. Benchmark in a series of Tweets earlier this month indicated it believed Uber will soon be worth more than $100 billion. Outside investors contemplating buying Uber shares, however, have indicated they think the company is worth less than its current $68 billion valuation - perhaps much less.
Other investors are already discounting company shares. Four mutual fund companies holding Uber investments recently marked down their shares by as much as 15 percent, according to the latest disclosure documents released.
RECKONING SOON?
Uber's losses stem from its drive to win global market share at almost any cost. That strategy was built on the assumption that Uber could achieve a dominant position in many big cities quickly and eventually raise prices. Kalanick themselves said low fares were temporary.
But eight years in, the strategy is now in doubt as competition in many markets continues to intensify. Uber must solve the problem of how to eliminate subsidies without losing customers and thereby undercutting its valuation.
“There is going to come a reckoning and they are going to have to raise prices,” said Brent Goldfarb, associate professor of management and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland. “But we know what happens when you raise prices - demand goes down, and perhaps substantially so.”
Uber has raised about $15 billion in funding since 2010, enabling it to discount fares and dole out bonuses to drivers that have at times exceeded $1,000.
In 2015, Uber passengers were paying only 41 percent of the actual cost of their trips, according to an analysis by transportation industry consultant Hubert Horan, based on financial statements from Uber.
Big discounts continue even in Uber's most mature market, its home city of San Francisco, where as recently as June it was offering some passengers 50 percent off their next 10 rides and $3 carpool rides, a cheaper rate than two years ago.
“I've gone crosstown in San Francisco for $12,” Goldfarb said. “There is no way that makes economic sense.”
FALSE SIGNAL
The Uber executive who spoke to Reuters pointed to a new “upfront” fare system that gives passengers a quote before their ride starts as one of Uber's key strategies to solving its pricing problem. In effect, it provides Uber a way to charge more without explicit per-mile fare increases.
The new system also uses an algorithm to better price rides to minimize losses. Someone requests Uber's carpool service on a route where there are unlikely to be other passengers to share the ride, for instance, will be quoted a higher price so the company does not have to eat the cost, said the executive, who asked not to be named.
The executive added that in the last year or so Uber has reduced its blanket subsidies and become better at targeting its promotions to both riders and drivers.
In ride-hailing, subsidies are necessary when first launching a new city, investors argue. A company needs lots of drivers and passengers to create a marketplace that works, and offering bonuses and discounts is the best way to recruit them.
But subsidies can create an artificial signal about the size of the market: many customers might be using the service only because it is cheap or free.
Once subsidies are turned off, “How do you know where the bottom is?” said Bejul Somaia, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, which is not among Uber's backers.
Uber already knows that higher prices scare off customers. A 2016 study by economists and Uber data experts found that when Uber alerted passengers that fares had doubled - part of Uber's older “surge pricing” scheme - ride purchases immediately fell by about 40 percent.
EIGHT-CENT RIDES
The Uber executive argued that higher fares would have only a minimal impact on ride volume.
Indeed, data from the New York taxi business suggest a modest impact in the United States. Industry research shows that, historically, when cabs raised fares by 20 percent, they lost 4 percent to 5 percent of their customers, said Bruce Schaller, a transportation consultant and former deputy commissioner at the New York City Department of Transportation.
“They have room to raise prices,” Schaller said, speaking of Uber. “There is no question to me as to whether this can be a profitable business.”
But unexpectedly tough competitive pressure from Lyft Inc, Uber's chief rival in the United States, has hindered Uber's efforts to become profitable. Uber has steadily lost U.S. market share to Lyft since last October, and now has 78 percent of the market, down from 85 percent in September, according to consumer spending data firm Earnest Research.
Subsidies have been especially debilitating to Uber in markets in Asia and the Middle East, where it is up against popular, well-funded local ride-service companies such as Ola, Grab and Careem.
FILE PHOTO: The Uber logo is seen on a screen in Singapore August 4, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White /File Photo
In India, a price war with Ola pushed prices down as low as 8 cents per kilometer - even the Uber executive said prices there are too cheap. But there's little sign the company is turning a corner in the subsidies war. When Uber ended expensive driver incentives in the country, drivers went on strike, crippling the service.
The region has sucked billions from Uber's coffers, raising the prospect that it could be forced to sell to local partners and abandon some countries, as it recently did in China and Russia.

For a long time, my experience as a public defender supported my belief that some people deserved life sentences. One client chilled me to the core. As a juvenile, they had graduated from burglary and auto theft to armed robbery, holding up three separate victims in the course of two days. The first victim was a young mother playing with their kids in a park; the second was an 11-year-old on a bike. My client preyed on the vulnerable. When they took their property at gunpoint, they said the same thing: “I want that.” It was the object they cared about; the people meant nothing to him.
I recognized something of David Biro in him. David is the man who murdered my sister, Nancy, their husband, Richard, and their unborn child. After a long struggle, I had forgiven David, said their name, even prayed for him. But I still wasn't certain I wanted them to serve less than their full life sentence. David was serving a mandatory life sentence for killing Nancy and Richard. They were serving a discretionary life sentence for intentionally killing their unborn child. But changes to sentencing procedures for juveniles by a Supreme Court ruling meant that David was likely to seek a resentencing hearing to reduce at least part of their sentence to less than life. I had no idea whether I could support the release of David at such a hearing. “He's still remorseless,” I told a friend.

“How do you know that?” they responded, leaning across the table. “You don't know that. You've never even spoken to him.” I was stunned. They were right.
I had spoken about the murders and forgiveness all over the world: France, Ireland, Mongolia, Japan and all across the United States. I had written articles about forgiving David Biro, given speeches at churches and schools and conferences. But one person I had not told: him. Never once had I communicated my forgiveness to David Biro. I had waited all these years for them to apologize to me. I saw it now with startling clarity: I had to apologize to him, for never telling them that I had forgiven him. I had to go first.
All God's Children
That wasn't all. The Holy Spirit, the spirit of God that moves like wind, blowing things open, scattering debris, wasn't done with me yet. On a Sunday morning month later, I went to a “church on the beach” service held by Christ Church, a charming, ivy-covered stone church set on a hill near Lake Michigan in the town where I live. It's a pleasant change from the Gothic formality of my Presbyterian church in downtown Chicago.
I arrived late, just in time to hear the priest, a man in a black shirt and white collar, cargo shorts and Birkenstocks, begin their homily. They were talking about how the Sunday after the Episcopal Church's national convention is a kind of liturgical season of its own: the season of complaints. Every year, they said, on the Sunday after the convention they feel like a human dartboard. Members of their congregation call or email him, demanding to know: Why did the church vote in favor of that? How could the church decide this? The priest's response: When you get a thousand Episcopalians in a room, you get a thousand different opinions. “It's a mess!” the priest observed, half-ruefully, half-cheerfully. They threw up their hands. “A mess!”
They went on, tying the messiness of the human condition to stories from Scripture. One was about King David, taking a woman who was the wife of another man, then arranging that man's death in battle. Another was the awful story of the beheading of John the Baptist because of Herod's moment of misbegotten pride.
“We are a mess, all of us. And how does God respond to that messiness? Mercy. Mercy. Mercy,” the priest concluded, pausing after each word, their voice dropping to a whisper with the last. That word hung in the still, sunlit air. We sat silent, no sound but the distant crash of waves on the beach, the song of birds overhead. The word lodged in my heart. Mercy.
We, the congregation, said that word a short time later, just before we lined up under the shade of a spreading tree to take the bread and wine. “Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world: have mercy upon us.”
You take away the sins of the world, I pondered. What does that mean? Whatever it meant, I knew that it couldn't mean saying to any human being: We are taking the sin you committed and freezing it in time forever. No matter what you do, how much you repent and show remorse, you are forever only one thing—a killer—and we will punish you endlessly for it. I knew this in my heart: I could no longer support this merciless sentence of life without parole for juveniles.
And in the very next moment, like daylight breaking into darkness, I knew something else. I'd always thought that the only thing big enough to pay for the life of my sister was a life sentence for their killer. Now I understood: The only thing big enough to equal the loss of their life was for them to be found.
The Letter
Late at night on the last day of September 2012, I put my two sons to bed and crept downstairs in the darkened house. I sat at the computer, turned on a small desk light and typed a letter to David, which read, in part:
I have heard news of you: how prison has been hard at times because of your association with me and my sisters. I am sorry for that. Nancy above all was about love; they never would have wanted their death to result in more brutality, even to the person who took them life.
You have heard news of me: how I have forgiven you for killing my family members. I never conveyed that forgiveness to you directly; I am sorry for that, too. It was wrong to tell other people and not the most important person of all: you....
[I read a book about forgiveness by Dr. Randall O'Brien. I called them to ask:] How do I reconcile with someone whose position is, I have not wronged you? They responded with some stunning observations.
First, that you and I are no different in the eyes of God. I am someone who has fallen short and hurt God's heart; I have sinned, to use that biblical word, just as you have. You are a child of God, created in God's image, just as I am. God loves you every bit as much as me; nothing you have done could ever stop God from loving you. The division I have made between us—you, guilty murderer, me, innocent victims' family member—was a false divide. I was wrong to do that.
Randall's second observation was this: How did Jesus respond to the people who were taking their life, in the very moment they were killing him? They prayed for them: Father, forgive them; they don't know what they are doing.
It struck me that I had never prayed for you. I had never even said your name. That was wrong of me, too. So I did pray for you, in the garden outside Kenilworth Union Church—you know the place—where Nancy and Richard and their baby are buried, alongside my father, who found their bodies the morning after they died.
Here is what I have come to believe: sentences like the death penalty and life without parole reflect our need to find a response to something as heinous as the murder of innocents equal in weight and gravity to the crime itself.
The only thing that could possibly pay for the loss of Nancy, their husband and their baby is this nearly impossible thing: that you would make your way home to God, the way the Prodigal Son in one of Jesus' parables finds their way home.
So I can no longer support the sentence of juvenile life without parole. It says to you, and to every other person serving that sentence: never. No matter what you do, how you may be transformed, or who you become, we will never even give you a chance to get out of prison....
How would they respond? Would they respond at all? I had visions of them reading my letter and laughing— showing it to a cellmate, maybe, scoffing at my earnest foolishness. All I knew was this: it was out of my hands now. It was in the hands of God.
Then one day I stopped at the mailbox in the public defender's office where I work and pulled a stack of mail from the slot: some returned subpoenas, some junk mail and a large manila envelope with a return address from a downstate prison. It was from David.
I called a friend and made an unusual request: would they open and read the letter first? They readily answered yes. Two days after I received the letter, they did that. After they read it, they looked up at my anxious face and smiled, a calm, quiet smile. “It's good,” they said. David's letter went on for 15 pages, and my friend read it aloud to me. It read, in part:
I know that for a long time you and your family have been looking for me to confess to the murders I committed years ago. Of course, as you know in the past, I have always maintained my “innocence.” Well, for a lot of reasons which I'll get into in a little bit, I think the time has come for me to drop the charade and finally be honest. You're right, I am guilty of killing your sister Nancy, and their husband Richard. I also want to take this opportunity to express my deepest condolences and apologize to you.
When I heard these words, a cry escaped my lips, a kind of sob buried so deep, I hadn't known it was there. I leaned forward, fingers pressed to my mouth. To hear those words: You're right, I am guilty.... I never thought I would hear that, ever. It was more than I'd ever dreamed. My friend was right: it was good.
My mind filled with wonder. Who could have imagined this? Not in my wildest dreams did I suppose David Biro might do what they had resisted doing ever since the murders: confess and say they were sorry. It was beyond anything I could have asked for—and I knew, even as I heard their apology, that it would not have come if I had not gone first. The time I spent waiting for that apology! That was the price I paid for my coldness toward Biro, for holding myself aloof. I understood for the first time what Jesus was saying to us about apologies: You go first. Don't wait.

So much of the talk surrounding the sinking New York Knicks concerns the plight of Carmelo Anthony: their health and happiness, comforts and qualms.
And rightly so. Melo is, for good or ill, the foundation on which the team has staked its future and fate.
All the while, a single, simple fact gets lost in the narrative shuffle: The Knicks wouldn't have even had the luxury of landing Anthony if it weren't for Amar'e Stoudemire.
Now, thanks to a resurgent season steeped in resilience, Stoudemire stands to be one of next summer's most intriguing free agents.
Given how onerous Stoudemire's five-year, $100 million contract wound up being, it's easy to assume New York will merely bid them adieu. It is, most believe, part and parcel with Phil Jackson's plan of recasting the Knicks along more sustainable, long-term lines.

And that very well may prove the case. As a practical matter, though, it would certainly behoove the Knicks to at least consider bringing Stoudemire back. They might have some fuel left in the tank, and they would imbue Jackson's rebuild with some semblance of roster flexibility.
"I think he's getting more comfortable with himself, their body, knowing what they can do out there on the basketball court and taking advantage of the mismatches and the situations," Anthony said of Stoudemire, according to NorthJersey.com's Steve Popper. "He's our go-to post player. [When] we need a bucket at times, we're definitely going to him."
The question, of course, is one of price. With the team's title window hinged tightly to a post-30 Anthony, every dollar counts. Every signing counts. Every roster spot—from Melo to the pine's splintered end—counts.

How much might STAT demand? It's impossible to say at this point. Although anyone wields Stoudemire's signature confidence—“I feel dominant” was how they described their season prospects to reporters—probably isn't too interested in taking the veteran's minimum.
Might Stoudemire entertain returning to New York at a discount? It's possible. Given the team's forthcoming flux and the cap-boosting potential of the league's new TV deal, something like three years, $18 million might make for a cool compromise.
Their zealous resilience may be enough for Knicks fans to forget the misplaced promise of 2010, when STAT arrived Manhattan-side as the supposed savior of a franchise in desperate need of a karmic exorcism. Four years later, the move has been seen more than crippling crutch than cultural cornerstone. Despite the misfire, Stoudemire has been nothing short of a class act—a guy more deserving of sympathy than indignation.
Just don't expect Jackson to re-break the bank for sentiment's sake. Not even with STAT tallying per-36 numbers largely on career par:
Call It a Comeback Stretch Points per 36 Rebounds per 36 TS% PER Career 22.2 9.1 .597 22.0 2014-15 18.9 10.5 .605 20.8 Basketball-Reference.com
Barring a hometown discount to stay with the Knicks, Stoudemire should still have plenty of suitors from which to choose. It's difficult to imagine the ring-less STAT bypassing a chance at a championship for the sake of more money.
While that predictably shortens the list of potential suitors, compelling fits remain.

The Toronto Raptors, poised to have close to $22 million in cap space this summer, come immediately to mind. With Amir Johnson and Tyler Hansbrough slated for free agency, the Raptors could be in the market for a first- or second-string 4, depending on how they see Patrick Patterson—who recently signed a long-term extension—fitting into the mix.
The Memphis Grizzlies are another intriguing possibility. While Stoudemire's defensive shortcomings are well-documented, their offensive versatility and explosiveness could pay potent dividends on a team that may part ways with both Marc Gasol and Kosta Koufos.
Whatever your big-picture stance on Stoudemire's NBA legacy, it's hard to deny the grace and gumption with which he's authored it. Even after the many knee injuries and myriad more setbacks, STAT has managed to recalibrate their game to be both more measured and more efficient.
Winslow Townson/Associated Press
Credit's due to Hakeem Olajuwon, of course. But Stoudemire's has been largely a reinvention of their own making—from high-flying falcon feeding off floating treats from Steve Nash to the more-deliberate-but-just-as-quick post wizards we see today. Gone is the unbridled explosiveness, replaced by a reliance on smooth moves and an even smoother touch.
In a recent dispatch for The New Yorker, Thomas Beller underscored what makes Stoudemire such a complex and polarizing paragon of today's NBA:
When the game started, the Knicks unravelled. The only excitement, from the New York fans' point of view, was seeing Amar'e Stoudemire, once so quick, demonstrate their new skills as a burly inside player. They were much thicker than they used to be—thickness and strength being the one advantage of getting older, with brute force and savvy as some compensation for the loss of agility and lightness. (The clever, earthbound oldsters are a connoisseur's delight if you get in the right frame of mind, Andre Miller being the most enjoyable.)
Such a seamless transition is far from a given. Dominique Wilkins and Vince Carter come to mind. Antonio McDyess, perhaps. For a player so long reliant on otherworldly athleticism, cobbling together an entirely different arsenal without sacrificing one iota of efficiency isn't merely admirable; it's exceedingly rare.
Which is a big part of what makes Stoudemire such a compelling free-agent target: Assuming their health holds and the deal is fair, it's entirely possible that STAT—at just 31 years old—could cast an even wider net in terms of their overall skill set.
Kathy Kmonicek/Associated Press
That Stoudemire seems to have embraced an amorphous role—starter today, sixth-man extraordinaire tomorrow—shouldn't be ignored. To the extent that true contenders probably aren't interested in anything beyond mere cosmetic changes, STAT's specs ring more enticing still: at the very least, he's a go-to option capable of single-handedly carrying a second unit.
At most? Chances are we've long bid that image goodbye.
History may well view Stoudemire's New York tenure as a clear-cut case of wrong place, wrong time—and at the wrong price to boot.
But if STAT's triangle twilight has proven anything, it's that the gap between overpaid and undervalued isn't always as wide as it seems.
Here at the shebeen, we've been keeping a weather eye on the case of Annie Dookhan, the former chemist at the state crime laboratory here in the Commonwealth (God save it!) who went to jail for fudging their results in such a way that they consistently favored the prosecution, and thus tainted somewhere north of 40,000 cases. They were a defense attorney's worst nightmare who became an appeals judge's worst nightmare. Believe it or not, Annie got out of the sneezer a month ago. (Most of their victims served more than the brief time Dookhan spent in stir.)
And believe it or not, another case has emerged which, according to The Boston Globe, is in certain ways even worse.
Investigators for the attorney general's office found that chemist Sonja Farak had tested drug samples or testified in court between about 2005 and 2013 while under the influence of meth, ketamine, cocaine, LSD, and other drugs, according to the report, much of which is based on Farak's own grand jury testimony. They even smoked crack before a 2012 interview with State Police officials inspecting the lab for accreditation purposes, they testified.
This woman was tripping when they tested drug samples and when they helped prosecutors in court send drug offenders away for God alone knows how long. And this wasn't in the usual Wollaston Boulevard sense of, "That cop that stopped me for that pound of meth on my lap was trippin', bro." Ms. Farak actually was on LSD while they were running their lab station. I'm surprised they didn't try to marry them spectrometer. But nothing can stop our implacable drug warriors from fighting this scourge upon the land.
"Anything that went through that lab while they were there is in question," said Anthony Benedetti, chief counsel of the Committee for Public Counsel Services. "It's too soon to know how many, but it clearly is in the thousands." Defense attorneys have pointed to Farak's alleged misdeeds for more than a year, suggesting they were more widespread than law enforcement officials believed. Tuesday's report provides the most detailed public portrait of their activities.
Yeah, who cares what those bleeding hearts think anyway?
Farak was arrested in January 2013 after a coworker discovered missing drug samples. They pleaded guilty in Hampshire Superior Court in early 2014 to four counts of tampering with evidence, four counts of stealing cocaine from the lab, and two counts of unlawful possession of cocaine, and was sentenced to 18 months behind bars.
In case you were wondering, the sentencing guidelines for simple possession of cocaine in Massachusetts recommend one-to-two years in jail, depending on the amount with which you get busted. This woman was found guilty of that, and of corrupting the criminal justice system, and of stealing the cocaine found in their possession, and of cooking up crack in their state lab after hours. They got 18 months. That's a pretty sweet deal. Why do I think something's getting buried here?
The newly released investigation was prompted by a ruling from the state Supreme Judicial Court last April, which said top state law enforcement officials failed to fully investigate how many times Farak tampered with drug evidence after their arrest in 2013. "This is a statewide problem," said attorney Luke Ryan, who helped bring the scope of Farak's drug use and evidence tampering to light, and who represents several defendants whose samples purportedly were tested by Farak. "The fact that we're doing this in 2016 instead of 2013 makes the job so much harder. . . . The chances of people falling through the cracks really increases."
Oh, that's why.
We are in the middle now of another drug frenzy, this one over the very real problem of opioid abuse. This time, for a number of reasons, including the racial demographic of the affected populations, it is so far being treated in our politics as a public health crisis, thank the Lord. But the cases of Annie Dookhan and Sonja Farak once again reveal the garish flaws of our "war" on other drugs. Suspicion without proof. Searches without warrant. Ludicrous over-sentencing and, up and down the line in the criminal justice system, pressure to produce convictions that is so overwhelming—and, it should be said, so professionally advantageous—that people feel compelled to put both their thumbs on the scale. Country's been trippin', bro.

JVM development is not an easy business. A production-grade JVM consists of many complex modules, and sometimes things go terribly wrong even though each module runs like clockwork in isolation. Some bugs are sporadic and hard to reproduce, and that makes debugging even more complicated. That's why testing is very important for us. We have a lot of automated tests that run every night on all supported machine configurations. And once in a while they would hit a bug in code supposed to be flawless since time immemorial…
Mystery
Recently, after some innocent-looking commits, several tests for ResourceBundle have started to fail sporadically. There is nothing special about those tests, they just verify that gathering resources from resource bundles of various types works. But for some reason, different unexpected errors would appear during certain runs.
Let's consider the following code snippet similar to the problematic test. Basically, it attempts to obtain a resource with the specified name from a resource bundle:
public static boolean checkResourceFromBundle(String expected) { try { URLClassLoader ucl = new URLClassLoader(new URL[]{new URL(urlString)}); ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(bundleName, locale, ucl); String resource = bundle.getString(resourceName); return expected.equals(resource); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println("FAILED: unexpected exception:"); e.printStackTrace(); return false; } }
If urlString , bundleName and locale are correct objects of the respective types, and a bundle with this name and locale can be found at the given URL, this method should never print the error message from the catch block, right?
It turns out that in some very specific cases it would do just that.
Moreover, it can fail not only when compiled with Excelsior JET, but also when run on the HotSpot JVM (OpenJDK 8).
So, how can it be?
The debugging process was quite tricky, as in the end we've tracked down the problem to a clash of advanced features of two distinct JVM modules:
Investigation
The problem occurs sporadically, so we better call the checkResourceFromBundle method in a loop:
public static void main(String[] args) { for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ITERATIONS; i++) { if (!checkResourceFromBundle(expectedResource)) { System.out.println("FAILED at iteration number " + i); return; } } System.out.println("PASSED"); }
Now, let's compile the above sample with javac and run it on HotSpot. One important detail: let's specify a rather small heap with -Xmx . We'll see later why this helps to reproduce the problem in a more reasonable time frame.
> /opt/jdk-8/bin/javac *.java > /opt/jdk-8/bin/java -Xmx4096k Test
and the result can be like the following:
FAILED: unexpected exception: java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find bundle for base name Bundle, locale en_US at java.util.ResourceBundle.throwMissingResourceException(ResourceBundle.java:1564) at java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundleImpl(ResourceBundle.java:1387) at java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1082) at Krol.checkResourceFromBundle(Test.java:21) at Krol.main(Test.java:34) Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException at java.util.ResourceBundle$Control.newBundle(ResourceBundle.java:2640) at java.util.ResourceBundle.loadBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1501) at java.util.ResourceBundle.findBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1465) at java.util.ResourceBundle.findBundle(ResourceBundle.java:1419) at java.util.ResourceBundle.getBundleImpl(ResourceBundle.java:1361) ... 3 more FAILED at iteration number 2984
All files and resource bundles have stayed the same throughout test execution, nothing has changed, but after 2983 iterations, an unexpected NullPointerException interrupted the execution.
Reveal
Okay, let's see: small -Xmx , the problem reproduces sporadically and the most apparent symptom is an unexpected NPE… One could guess that it is somehow connected with the garbage collector (GC), and would be totally right indeed. Let's look at the place where the NPE gets thrown: ResourceBundle.java:2640
public ResourceBundle newBundle(String baseName, Locale locale, String format, ClassLoader loader, boolean reload) { ... Class<? extends ResourceBundle> bundleClass = (Class<? extends ResourceBundle>) loader.loadClass(bundleName); ... }
A NullPointerException can only be thrown here if loader is null. So let's follow the stack trace and find its definition. At ResourceBundle.java:1501 there is the following call:
bundle = control.newBundle(cacheKey.getName(), targetLocale, format, cacheKey.getLoader(), reload);
where cacheKey is an instance of the CacheKey class:
private static class CacheKey implements Cloneable { ... private LoaderReference loaderRef; ... ClassLoader getLoader() { return (loaderRef != null) ? loaderRef.get() : null; } ... }
and LoaderReference is actually a weak reference to a ClassLoader instance:
private static class LoaderReference extends WeakReference<ClassLoader> implements CacheKeyReference { ... }
It means that if loaderRef holds the last reference to a ClassLoader instance, the GC can collect the latter without any problems. In our example, cacheKey was created in the getBundleImpl() method:
private static ResourceBundle getBundleImpl(String baseName, Locale locale, ClassLoader loader, Control control) { ... CacheKey cacheKey = new CacheKey(baseName, locale, loader); ... }
and that was the last use of the given URLClassLoader! As there are no more uses of that object, the GC has full rights to decide that it is already dead. So, if you are (not so) lucky, it will collect the ClassLoader object, and newBundle() will throw an NPE moments later. We provoked this by specifying a small -Xmx value and executing the example in a loop. That's why you should always check whether the result of a WeakReference.get() method call is not null. (Yeah, this was the TL/DR.)
Stealthy Bug
Good, now we understand what is going on here. But there are still some unanswered questions, so let's dig a little bit deeper.
We have noticed the problem because some tests had started to fail. But why didn't they fail before that? Looks like the problem was always there…
Seemingly, it was those innocent-looking changes in Excelsior JET that indirectly affected memory consumption patterns in some scenarios. GC started to happen more frequently, or less frequently, or at different moments of time, and that has caused the problem to reveal itself. It was just like the butterfly effect.
Then, we have confirmed that the bug is in the reference implementation of the Java SE library. How has it managed to remain unnoticed by Oracle engineers and the OpenJDK community?
The thing is that the problematic scenario is actually rather artificial for HotSpot. First of all, GC should occur within a very short time span between the creation of a CacheKey instance and an attempt to retrieve its class loader. But, more importantly, the getBundleImpl() method should have already been compiled with C1 or C2.
Unlike those compilers, the HotSpot interpreter is not capable of determining whether some use of a local variable is the last one or not. The GC has no choice but to make a conservative assumption that an object, or, more precisely, an object reference stored in a local variable of an interpreted method is alive. Long live the object! That's why the problem does not manifest itself if HotSpot is forced to run in interpreter-only mode with -Xint :
> /opt/jdk-8/bin/javac *.java > /opt/jdk-8/bin/java -Xmx4096k -Xint Test PASSED
Many applications gather their resources from bundles only once, during startup. Therefore the number of invocations of the problematic method is likely to not exceed any of the HotSpot compile thresholds .
Now you understand why this bug hardly ever bites in real-life situations if the application runs on the HotSpot VM. But the Excelsior JET AOT compiler always compiles all methods of all classes supplied as input, so the problem is more noticeable to its users.
Treatment
All right, but nevertheless, the problem is present in the Oracle JDK. Will it be fixed?
We are not sure about JDK 8, but it appeared that the problem is already fixed in JDK 9. The ResourceBundle class was changed to support modules, but the new logic for modules is quite similar to the old one for class loaders:
private static final class CacheKey { ... private final KeyElementReference<Module> moduleRef; private final KeyElementReference<Module> callerRef; ... }
Here, KeyElementReference also extends WeakReference , but cacheKey is now used properly:
Module module = cacheKey.getModule(); if (module == null) { // should not happen throw new InternalError( "Module for cache key: " + cacheKey + " has been GCed."); }
But why the code marked as “should not happen” would not happen? Looking at the new getBundleImpl() method implementation, you may notice that calls of the Reference.reachabilityFence() method were added before the return statement:
private static ResourceBundle getBundleImpl(String baseName, Locale locale, Class<?> caller, ClassLoader loader, Control control) { ... CacheKey cacheKey = new CacheKey(baseName, locale, module, callerModule); ... // keep callerModule and module reachable for as long // as we are operating with WeakReference(s) to them // (in CacheKey)... Reference.reachabilityFence(callerModule); Reference.reachabilityFence(module); return bundle; }
These calls are needed solely to prolong the life of objects passed as parameters. The GC won't collect those objects before getBundleImpl() completes its job, and that solves the problem:
> /opt/jdk-9/bin/javac *.java > /opt/jdk-9/bin/java -Xmx4096k Test PASSED
However, there is one tricky detail still left. Let's look at the definition of reachabilityFence() :
@DontInline public static void reachabilityFence(Object ref) { // Does nothing, because this method is annotated with @DontInline // HotSpot needs to retain the ref and not GC it before a call to // this method }
A сall to an empty static method is just a sitting duck for any optimizing compiler, which would definitely try to inline that call so as to make it disappear without a trace . If the compiler inlined the calls of reachabilityFence() , those Module instances would have received death sentences right after the creation of weak references to them. But pay attention to the annotation: @DontInline is a proprietary HotSpot annotation telling its compilers to avoid inlining of particular methods. That's why reachabilityFence() works. HotSpot compilers love to inline empty static methods, but the annotation prevents them from doing that, making the fence work as expected.
Excelsior JET loves to inline empty static methods too, so we have to prevent inlining of reachabilityFence() as well. We could use our own internal mechanisms to achieve that, or teach our compilers to recognize that HotSpot-specific @DontInline annotation. The choice is not obvious, though. We'll make the final decision during the course of working on Java 9 support.
That's all for today! Be careful when using weak references and always check whether their referents are not null, because they can be already dead for a long time.

This stretch along Connecticut Avenue in Chevy Chase could be slated for additional development under current Purple Line rail plans. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)
Maryland transit officials' proposal to have a private company design, build, operate and help pay for the light-rail Purple Line in the Washington suburbs would be one of the first such arrangements in the United States, raising questions about potential risks and financial impacts.
Only one other U.S. transit project, a commuter rail line in Denver, entails such a far-reaching public-private partnership, but it is still under construction.
Details of the 35-year Purple Line plan have begun to emerge as the Maryland Department of Transportation prepares to seek state approval Wednesday to pursue it. A consortium of private companies would be expected to contribute $500 million to $900 million to the $2.2 billion project.
The private team would be reimbursed for design, construction and equipment costs as work progressed over five years. The state would then pay the company $100 million to $200 million annually to operate and maintain the line for 30 years. The payments could be reduced if the company did not meet certain standards, such as providing reliable service and clean trains.
The private financing costs would be paid back over time with Purple Line fare revenue, officials said. If ridership on the 16-mile line between Montgomery and Prince George's counties did not materialize as anticipated, fare revenue from other Maryland transit systems would make up the difference, state officials said.
View Graphic Map of the proposed Purple Line
Maryland transportation officials say such a partnership would take advantage of the private sector's light-rail expertise and require the companies to assume the financial risks of any construction delays or cost overruns. The efficiencies gained from one private entity overseeing all aspects — from the drawing board to bulldozers to trains on tracks — are projected to save up to 20 percent over 35 years, officials say.
“There's a really strong incentive for [the private companies] to focus on quality and durability,” said Maryland Deputy Transportation Secretary Leif A. Dormsjo. “They have to really own not just the construction project but also make sure we don't have surprises once riders start to use it.”
The approach, while considered innovative, is drawing scrutiny. Five U.S. transit projects have used public-private partnerships in some form, Maryland officials say. However, the Purple Line would be the only one besides the Denver project to rely heavily on private financing.
The plan will get its first test of political support Wednesday, when the state Board of Public Works — comprising the governor, comptroller and state treasurer — is scheduled to vote on whether to allow the Transportation Department to seek private proposals.
State Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery), who reviewed the plan as a member of the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee, said they consider it a “very risky proposition.”
“It's attractive. It's an innovative approach,” Madaleno said. “But we don't have very many, if any, examples of how this works out.”
Moreover, they said, communities along the line need assurances that a private company would fulfill promises by the state, such as to run trains on a bridge over Connecticut Avenue in north Chevy Chase rather than stopping traffic.
The east-west Purple Line would run two-car trains along local streets and link communities between Bethesda and New Carrollton with Metrorail stations, MARC commuter rail stations and Amtrak.
Construction would not begin until at least 2015, but critical decisions about how the state would pay for, build and operate the line will be made over the next 12 months.
Maryland Treasurer Nancy K. Kopp said their staff is evaluating the details of the initial proposal, including whether bond rating agencies would consider the state's payments toward the private sector's borrowing costs to be government debt.
Kopp said they see the benefits of sharing risks with the private sector and gaining companies' expertise, but they share concerns about the state's lack of experience with such a far-reaching private partnership.
“It should cause everyone concern and make us complete our due diligence very thoroughly,” Kopp said. “We want to make sure that if we do it, we do it well. . . . We want to make sure we have ferreted out all potential problems.”
Several state lawmakers briefed on the proposal said it sounds good in theory, but they still have questions: What if the private company goes bankrupt? Should the state lock into one contract worth billions of dollars for more than three decades? How much of a funding crunch could the state face if Purple Line ridership falls short of projections?
“Will the revenues be there to cover it down the line?” said Sen. James E. DeGrange Sr. (D-Anne Arundel), who chairs the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee's transportation subcommittee.
Several lawmakers said they worry that even with private investment, the Purple Line would siphon off money from roads and other transit projects, including the $2.6 billion light-rail Red Line proposed for Baltimore and the $545 million Corridor Cities Transitway bus line planned for upper Montgomery.
“The concern is what projects might be delayed — and be delayed for years — because of one project,” DeGrange said.
If the Board of Public Works approves the initial proposal, the Maryland Department of Transportation plans to issue a “request for qualifications” to companies by Oct. 31. State officials said they hope to announce a preferred private partner in fall 2014, begin construction in summer 2015 and open the line in mid-2020.
The state must move quickly, Dormsjo said, because the Federal Transit Administration is expected to announce in February whether it will recommend the Purple Line for $900 million in highly competitive federal funding.
“We need to demonstrate that we have our act together . . . so they see we're ready for a federal grant and we have a good financial plan,” Dormsjo said. “We're in a make-or-break period for the project.”
Traditionally, transit agencies plan and design new rail lines with government funds. To build them, the agency uses more public money or finances the project by issuing new debt. The agency then operates and maintains the line using fare revenue and public subsidies.
However, like other states, Maryland is looking for new ways to build expensive infrastructure projects with tight budgets and debt limits. Experts say public-private partnerships, like the one used to build the new tolled express lanes on the Capital Beltway in Northern Virginia, provide private money and pass on to the private sector some risks, such as unforeseen construction delays or changes in energy costs.
“It's not necessarily cheaper, but you have someone with skin in the game protecting you from uncertainty,” said Art Guzzetti of the American Public Transportation Association.
Robert Puentes, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who has written about such partnerships, said the key concern for taxpayers will be knowing “what the public sector will be on the hook for.” Governments also must ensure that public policy goals such as providing better transportation and spurring job growth do not lose out to the private sector's profit motive, they said.
“They're not mutually exclusive,” Puentes said, “but there is a fine balance there.”
Critics of public-private partnerships say they can lack transparency and drive up costs because relatively few companies can compete to manage such large, highly complex projects. Others say private companies should not be ceded decades of control over a public asset.
“My concern is if the project goes south and the state has to pony up,” said Del. Luiz R.S. Simmons (D-Montgomery), who opposed the new Maryland law that made such partnerships easier to do. “If it is a mistake, generations of taxpayers will have to live with it.”
Dormsjo said it makes sense for a private company to operate the Purple Line because it would be too far from the state's transit operations center in Baltimore. They said the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has no interest in running a light-rail system, because it specializes in Metro's heavy-rail subway.
The state would buy private property needed for right of way, own the rail line, set fares and oversee the agreement. Along the way, Maryland officials said, legal, financial and engineering consultants would lend expertise and help the state analyze “lessons learned” from Canadian transit lines and other transportation projects with similar deals. The General Assembly's budget committees would review any final Purple Line agreement before the Board of Public Works would be asked to approve it.
“I admit this is the maiden voyage for this idea,” Maryland Transportation Secretary James T. Smith Jr. told state lawmakers at a September hearing. They added, “If we can't get a deal that looks good for 30 years . . . we're not going to recommend it to you.”
Growing up in England, I attended a school where administrators thought it was a good idea to teach two dozen rowdy 14-year-old girls “food technology.” This turned out to be a euphemistic mantle given to a cooking class in which we whiled away the hours (all 30 of them) weighing our ingredients, and often our heads and elbows, before singeing one or more of the asupervisorstioned.
It was, in my opinion, a total waste of time. So I was curious what the school year has in store for the children around the world who are returning to class this week. (According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, most developed countries have academic years that begin in September and end in June.) Pew Research Center took data on the average number of required hours from the Education Commission of the States and compared it with similar data from other countries using an OECD report published last summer. Totting up the hours, it's no wonder my colleague looked so confused when I mentioned my languorous school years — Americans are required to put in more classroom hours than I ever did.
Only in Chile, Israel and Australia do elementary school students spend longer in class each year than their U.S. counterparts. In lower-secondary school (defined as starting six years after primary education and lasting three years, so about the equivalent of middle school in the U.S.), the average year in America lasts 1,016 hours, or for 42 continuous days, longer than in most other developed countries. When we combine primary and lower-secondary school hours, the U.S. ranks fourth of 34 countries.
The standardized national numbers in this chart can obscure important variations in each of those countries' classrooms. In the U.S., for example, not all states count what the OECD calls “required schooling” in the same way. Pew illustrated this point using Texas, where the number of school hours per year (1,260) appears be the highest in America but where, unlike other states, that total includes lunch and recess.
And, of course, money might affect the syllabus, too. The 2007 schools and staffing survey by the National Center for Education Statistics found that in a typical week, third-graders in U.S. public schools spent 2.8 hours more on core subjects, but 30 minutes less on foreign languages and 30 minutes less at recess, than their counterparts in private schools.
I'm still none the wiser about hours spent studying food technology worldwide. But even if American students are spared the pain (literally) of attempting to chop potatoes, I won't begrudge them given how many hours they'll be required to spend in class this year.
CORRECTION (Sept. 4, 3:26 p.m.): An earlier of version of this story included several paragraphs and a chart discussing the time students spend studying math and science in different countries. The supporting data, taken from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), was incorrect and represented scores on tests rather than hours of classroom instruction. Annual instruction data is not available in the TIMSS database, and we have removed the inaccurate chart and surrounding text.
Did Christianity Bring Down the Roman Empire?
picture source
Rome was a vast empire that lasted for about 1,ooo years. It was founded in 753 B.C and collapsed around the 5th century. To give you a brief history of what happened in this time, Rome was split into two different empires: East and West. The western part of the Empire fell in 476 A.D while the Eastern Empire thrived until Muslim forces conquered Constantinople in 1453 A.D.
At its height, Rome held territories from Britain to Asia Minor. Many of the Roman roads that connected Europe in that ancient time are still used today. So what eventually brought down this great empire?
Yes, it was stretched too thin. Yes, there were several barbarian attacks and invasions that eventually brought the whole thing down.
Yet there was another decisive factor as well: the forced conversion to Christianity.
The empire converted to Christianity in 395 A.D. and fell apart about 80 years later.
MAPPING A TOLERANT EMPIRE
Up until that point, Rome was tolerant of different religious and cultural ideas. This was the key to their success actually. The persecution of Christians in Rome was a highly exaggerated affair. The Christians were persecuted more for their refusal to follow Roman laws than they were for their religious beliefs.
For example, if a Fundamentalist Religious Cult in America refused to follow our most basic of laws (and claimed God as the reason) we'd probably throw the practitioners of that cult in jail.
I am not trying to downplay the barbarity of Roman conquest here. I am well aware that Romans had their fair share of slavery, warfare and capital punishment. They also did force Roman cultural norms upon those they conquered. (The execution of the Druids at the Isle of Mona was a particularly gruesome affair)
However, the Romans did not do a wholesale eradication of the cultures and Gods of the people they conquered. Most people were permitted to continue with these traditions as long as they also worshiped the Roman emperor as a God and paid their taxes. (With the exception of Carthage. The Romans waged a brutal campaign and salted the Earth in Carthage so that nothing could grow).
The Romans even added other cultures Gods within their own repertoire. For example, when the Gauls started fighting within Roman military ranks, Roman Calvary started saying prayers to the Gallic Horse Goddess Epona.
Pictures of the Egyptian Goddess Isis suckling their son Horus were also circulated in Roman homes (later to be copied by images of the Mother Mary suckling Jesus).
(Roman Statue of Egyptian Goddess Isis)
My point here is that the Roman empire could not have ever hoped to become as large and powerful as they did if they were not tolerant. Rome had its flaws to be sure, but it was an empire that was highly advanced for its time. It was a place where art, science, poetry, and medicine flourished. Rome was an advanced society because they learned from those they conquered and became stronger in the process. You can only benefit from your conquered subjects if you allow them to maintain some level of autonomy – if you don't crush the spirit and soul of those you rule over.
For example, by allowing the Greeks to maintain their “Greekness” so to speak, The Romans were able to share the benefits of the great art, knowledge and science produced by the Greeks. Many Roman families even employed tutors for their children from Greece (or had Greek slaves for this purpose). The Romans also knew how to turn the ferocity of the Gauls to their advantage, by employing Gallic mercenaries in the military with the promise of Roman Citizenship as a reward. The Gauls could not have been great warriors if the Romans tried to eradicate and supplant Gallic culture in entirety.
Xenophobic and narrow minded civilizations can not achieve the same grandeur as Rome did. For example, when the Ming Dynasty in China abandoned exploration and trade in favor of Isolationism, their status as a world power declined rapidly – and they were eventually conquered by European powers within a few centuries.
When Rome embraced Monotheistic Christianity, their blazing torch of culture, art and power was extinguished. Christian values were completely contrary to Roman Pagan values. Romans and their Gods valued a bold and heroic life in the present. The Gods rewarded those who were particularly brave, beautiful or artistic. Christianity, with its focus on a meek and mild existence in exchange for a glorious afterlife was completely contrary to indigenous European values in general.
Up until Rome's forced conversion in 395 A.D, Christianity was an insignificant cult, a fringe minority that many people never even heard of.
Yet once Rome converted, Christianity released a madhouse of horrors upon Rome. Ancient temples to other Gods were sacked and destroyed. Entire libraries of valuable knowledge and literature were burned to the ground. The tolerance that allowed Rome to rule over a vast and diverse empire was replaced by a zealous, single minded cult that destroyed all who didn't subscribe to their ideology. Even other Christians were killed if they didn't adhere to the “correct” version of Christianity.
Even if the strongest person swallows a poison, they become more vulnerable to the most mild of viruses. Once Rome embraced Christianity, it fell prey to barbarian invasion, splintering and eventual destruction.
The light of Rome was replaced by a millenia of darkness and ignorance. Western Europe became rampant with inquisitions, crusades, witch burnings and disease. It wasn't until the church started to lose authority in Europe around the Renaissance that Western Europe began to get back onto its feet again. Coincidence? I think not.
Spiritually the world must once again learn how to tolerate different systems of belief that are aligned with the real principals of human nature (rather than attempting a system of morality only suitable for the dead).
May the torch of the Ancient Pagan world burn bright once again as many around the world reawaken to ancient values.

EX DEO – ROMULUS
Almost a year ago, a group of Dallas gun owners decided their favorite hardware needed a little sunlight and fresh air. So these mouth-breathing locals started taking semi-automatic weapons on play dates to chain restaurants like Chili's and Chipotle, causing a wave of confusion to pass over Awesome Blossom-stuffed faces and lots of coverage on network and cable news shows.
It was a movement just waiting to be skewered. And Barry Kooda was the man for the job.

Continue Reading
Kooda, whose real name is Barry Huebner, is a 62-year-old musician and songwriter best known for their work with the proto-punk band the Nervebreakers. With the rise of the "open carry" movement, they saw a target in desperate need of a healthy injection of humor, humility and basic common sense.
After reading "one too many" stories about people bringing dangerous weapons into public places, Kooda gathered up their weapons of choice, their guitars, and posed with them on their porch to announce their own "open carry guitar" movement on their Facebook page. That picture sparked a surge of viral support, a few "unfriendings" and a huge rally that they recently announced will return to the Continental Avenue Bridge over the Trinity River on Sunday, May 3.
Kooda's viral success was something of an accident. In that first photo they  a face mask, sunglasses and a baseball cap with a neck shield, a medical necessity because they were taking medicine for Hepatitis C that prohibited them from being in direct contact with sunlight. That outfit defined an heroic alter-ego for Kooda and became the symbol of the open carry guitar movement. Just like Cyclops' laser-blocking eye shield or Rogue's skin-tight gloves, Kooda's gear signified a pseudo-superhero with a satiric wit and an innate talent for stirring up trouble and dressing down an army of ignorance and iron-fisted stupidity.
"It made an image in people's minds and provoked a thought in them like, 'Oooh, this is mysterious. Let's get behind this,'" Kooda says. "People started posting pictures and getting ready for the rally, and one guy even had a bandana and a mask on, doing what I did. It was just an accidental necessity."
Kooda insists they didn't intend to make themselves the icon of the Open Guitar Rally, which in its first year attracted a huge crowd of guitar-clutching followers who walked back and forth from one end of the Continental Avenue Bridge to the other, strumming strings the whole way. They just became a canvas that the crowd could use to paint and project their own ideas for the movement.
"I've always said I'm an instigator, not an organizer," Kooda says.
Barry's penchant for instigation goes back to high school. The unrelenting horror of the Vietnam War was impossible to escape, Kooda says, and they jumped into the political fray by reading Stoney Burns' underground newspapers and joining in protests on and off the Irving High School campus, even though they were just "a dumb kid."
That "dumb kid" grew up pretty quickly one afternoon when they met a Vietnam veteran during a protest at Lee Park. "He said, 'Man, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. You've never been there,'" Kooda remembers. "I was just some punk kid. They were one of the guys who got spit on when they showed up at the airport. I was like, 'Dude, you're right.'"
So Kooda quit school in 1971 and joined the Army in hopes of getting stationed in Vietnam. But they showed an abnormally high aptitude for mechanical reasoning and ended up in Korea, where they got "free access to the badassest weapons you could have."
"If there was something to shoot, I'd go shoot it," they say. "It's fun. You never make the correlation. Most people didn't think that when you blow up stuff, it's not just stuff. It was just stuff to us and we never considered the fact that we would be going to war and would actually be doing harm to other humans. That was the case. We were just shooting the target."
The University of Texas shootings carried out by gunman Charles Whitman in 1966 and the Tylenol poisonings of 1982 seemed to widen the divide between the hopeful and the cynical, Kooda says. They brought those harsh realizations to their music and found that punk rock struck the perfect balance by demanding to be heard and understood without actually throwing a punch or firing a shot.
"No one is listening to you," Kooda explains. "You have opinions, you have problems and no one is listening to you. So you pretty much had to get a bullhorn and yell into their face, 'DO YOU HEAR ME?'" For the former war-protester, at the time almost 30, punk rock was the outlet he'd always been waiting for. "It was all-inclusive, like the guitar rally. [The rally] brought in people who had overlapping viewpoints, not the same viewpoints. Punk rock was the same way."
Kooda said the Open Carry Guitar Rally and movement were never intended to be a statement for total gun control or even taking away those guns. Their intention was purely to make fun of the open carry movement as an ideal. Plus, as a fifth-generation Texan, guns were as big a part of their childhood as snipe hunts and riding in pickups without seat belts. But open carry supporters seem to be losing self-awareness along with their grasp on reality, and Kooda wants to raise that awareness. The movement seems to be gaining steam on Facebook after the Texas Senate passed an open carry bill that will surely be signed into law once it reaches the governor's desk.
"Gun sense is what put me into this thing as well," Kooda says. "Sensible gun ownership is completely different now from what it was then. I had my first .22 when I was 11. You knew how to handle them. You knew what the dangers were, and you knew what was morally and ethically correct and you didn't ever think about carrying your long rifle through a coffee shop, which there weren't any. It's flabbergasting. That's just not sensible."
They don't need the costume that became the iconic image from the first rally anymore -- he's been given a clean bill of health -- but he'll don it again in May. It's become their uniform for the job. "It's not necessary for me personally, but it's the stage costume," they say. "If you're going to be KISS, you've got to dress like KISS."
Just like comic book superheroes, the mask and sunglasses also help them to conceal their true weaknesses: crippling shyness and a bewildering sense of humility.
"The biggest problem I have is I can never understand why anybody cares a damn about anything I have to say," they admit. "I don't understand it. I'm flabbergasted. You want to hear me? I'm so insecure with that. I can't really turn into this big fathead like Kanye and enjoy it. I would love to have that persona. I'm flattered that anybody cares about anything I do."

Cambridge city council leader says they regret following 'bureaucratic guideline' to remove punctuation from street signs
A council has been praised for its "sensible decision" to reverse a policy of banning apostrophes on street signs.
Cambridge city council faced criticism from self-declared defenders of grammar for its decision to remove punctuation in new road names, with some campaigners using marker pens to fill in apostrophes missing from signs.
The local authority claimed it was only following national guidelines that claimed punctuation could confuse emergency services.
Tim Bick, leader of the council, said an "executive decision" had now been taken to make clear that for future street names "we will not be obliged to avoid proper punctuation".
They said: "After consulting with my colleague Tim Ward, executive councillor for planning, we decided we must call time on the great apostrophe debate.
"Councillor Ward has taken an executive decision to amend our street-naming policy to make clear that for future new street names in Cambridge we will not be obliged to avoid proper punctuation when it is required by the relevant name.
"It is now clear that the original decision made two years ago to ban the apostrophe from street names flew below everyone's radar, amazingly even after public consultation at the time.
"It is a nonsense to deny the English language when applying it to everyday terms describing where people live."
Bick said the minor matter had become a major story and it was time to put it to bed.
"We rue the day we allowed ourselves to be influenced by a bureaucratic guideline, which nobody has been able to defend to us now that it has come under the spotlight," they added.
Kathy Salaman, director of the Cambridgeshire-based Good Grammar Company, said: "Obviously it's a great decision. A sensible decision. There was a great strength of feeling out there.
"I acknowledge that apostrophes are not a matter of life or death, but it's important when we're trying to raise literacy standards in the country and raise Britain's profile throughout the world as we languish in literacy tables."
Salaman said claims that apostrophes on street signs could hinder emergency services had been "blown out of the water", and said fire, police and ambulance services in the area had said it was "not a problem".
A street sign in Cambridge reading "Scholars Way leading to Pepys Court and Fitzgerald Place" was among those altered with a marker pen, with apostrophes added to the words "Scholars" and "Pepys".
Ward said: "If the system is able to accommodate all the old street names which still have apostrophes and there are also councils which have never signed up to the policy, then the system can accommodate the relatively small proportion that will need one as new streets get named.
"We understand that the body whose guidance we were following when determining our street-naming policy in 2011 has subsequently reversed its own position on punctuation, so, there is now no reason at all for us to retain it as a part of our policy.
"We already subscribe to keeping street names as simple as possible for the purposes of easy recognition and we do so in consultation with the emergency services and Royal Mail."
Despite Microsoft's increased efforts to dethrone Google, the company still controls a majority of the search market. Hundreds of millions of people use Google to search the Web on a daily basis. One entrepreneur has argued that Google's search engine isn't as efficient as it should be, however. Aaron Harris, co-founder of the website Tutorspree, noted that “Google won search by providing the best organic results users had ever seen.” But since then, the company has begun to replace organic results with “revenue generating Google products.” In fact, Harris calculates that real search results only account for 13% of screen real estate above the fold when searching Google with a 13-inch laptop. They noted that Google's Ads account for 29% of the page, while a Google Map takes up 7% and the navigation bar occupies 14% of the page.
Things are even worse if you access the search engine from a mobile device. Depending on your location, you may see no organic results whatsoever until you begin scrolling.
“Open your iPhone. Search for ‘Italian Food.' What do you see? If you're in NYC, you see 0 organic results,” they noted. “You see an ad unit taking half the page, and then a Google owned Zagat listing. Start scrolling, you'll see a map, then Google local listings. After four full-page scrolls, you'll have the organic listings in front of you.”
Harris goes on to explain that Google is changing the search engine that “made it great,” adding that it now caters to “the garden of Google products.” They go on to say that “if you compete with Google in any way, you're in its crosshairs,” warning that a company's “chance of ranking high enough to garner traffic are virtually nil and getting smaller.”
There are fears that Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan, could fall to the Taliban.
Militants have besieged the city despite US airstrikes and local officials have warned that without support from the central government the whole province "will collapse soon".
The insurgents have seized areas only a few miles from the city centre and they reportedly control all roads leading to Lashkar Gah.
Exhausted soldiers are running out of food and police checkpoints are "falling one by one", according to residents.
The Taliban effectively control or contest 10 of the 14 districts in Helmand, the deadliest province for British and US forces in Afghanistan over the past decade.
Image: Afghan security personnel search drivers at a checkpoint in Lashkar Gah
Since the Taliban were ousted in 2001, there have been 454 UK military personnel deaths, the vast majority in Helmand.
Heavy fighting has broken out in Nad Ali district between Afghan government troops and militants as insurgents also carried out attacks in Nawa district, just south of Lashkar Gah.
The situation has been made worse by roads in the region being heavily mined by the Taliban.
It has sent an elite new commando force into Helmand called 'Sara Khitta' - the Red Brigade in Pashto.
"They are a highly trained, well-armed unit with modern equipment including night vision goggles," said a Taliban commander in Nad Ali district.
If it takes Lashkar Gah, it would be the second provincial capital it has captured since being toppled in a US-led military campaign 15 years ago.
The insurgents briefly held the northern city of Kunduz last October before being driven out by American-backed Afghan troops.
Holidaymakers Ambushed By The Taliban
Lashkar Gah is also struggling to cope with an influx of people fleeing the fighting across Helmand, with most of the 30,000 displaced coming to the capital.
Omar Zawak, the provincial governor's spokesperson, said: "It is difficult for the city to contain all of them. Families, children, women, all have to sleep on the streets.
"There is a shortage of food and clean water. We need urgent support."
An Afghan security official in Kabul confirmed the existence of the new Taliban unit in Helmand, but played down its impact on the battlefield.
The US has stepped up airstrikes supporting Afghan forces on the ground, highlighting the intensity of the battle in Helmand.
"The situation down there remains tense and somewhat contested," NATO said in a statement.
"It remains an ongoing security concern and there has been fighting down there for the last several weeks.
"We remain confident that the Afghan forces are fighting effectively and that they will continue to secure Lashkar Gah."
CLAY COUNTY, W. VA. (WSAZ) -- West Virginia State Police arrested a man who they say broke into their neighbor's home and stole three rolls of toilet paper.
Troopers arrested Phillip Burnside Friday night after they broke into a home along Little Italy Road in Ivydale.
They say the victim was working out of town when they got an alert from their home security system, on their phone, that someone was inside their home. That's when the victim asked their sister, who lives near by, to check on theirs house.
The victim's sister told troopers when they arrived, they saw Burnside who pretended to be a concerned neighbor and was helping them look around the house for the intruder.
Once obtaining surveillance video from the home, troopers say it was obvious that Burnside was the intruder. They say they later confessed to stealing three rolls of toilet paper.
Troopers say they believe Burnside got into the home through a window and unlocked the front door. They believe they have been in the house before and has stolen other items from the home.
Burnside is charged with nighttime burglary, but troopers say they could face additional charges.
 They are being held in Central Regional Jail on a $50,000 bond.
On a campaign swing through the political battleground of Virginia, President Barack Obama on Friday mocked House Republicans for holding yet another vote against their landmark health care law. Thursday's action was the 33rd time the president's foes in the House of Representatives voted to repeal or defund Obamacare in whole or in part.
"I notice the House of Representatives, the Republicans in the House of Representatives, they voted to repeal it again," Obama said at a rally in Virginia Beach.
"That was the 33rd time they've done that—33 votes to repeal the health care bill. All it would take is one vote to make sure that all of you don't see your taxes go up next year. You tell me what would be a better use of time," the president said to cheers from the rowdy crowd.
They were referring to their call to extend the Bush-era tax cuts on incomes up to $250,000. Obama wants to see the reductions for higher brackets expire, as scheduled, come Jan. 1. Republicans want to extend all of the tax cuts.
House Republicans plan to vote the final week of July on legislation to prolong the tax cuts for all income levels. The party's majority in the chamber is expected to approve that easily. And Democrats in tough re-election battles could swing behind Speaker John Boehner.
"The unemployment rate is 8.2%. This month Republicans will vote to stop the looming tax hike. The President would like to raise taxes," a spokesperson for Boehner, Brendan Buck, said on Twitter.
Obama also defended their record on taxes, underlining that they had signed into law repeated tax cuts for middle class Americans—and got in a dig at a favorite target, Fox News Channel."Just in case some of your friends and neighbors, or you know, Uncle Jim, who's a little stubborn and has been watching Fox News and they think that somehow I raised taxes, let's just be clear: We've lowered taxes for middle class families since I came into office," they said.
And Obama even got in a little jab at lawmakers. The president said—as they have been saying on the stump—that this "will be my last campaign." When that got boos and disappointed "awwws," they quipped: "There's a term limit thing in the presidency. This isn't like Congress, I can't just keep on running."
The 'biggest threat to the world financial system' comes from the U. S. Congress, Cable said. Brit pol: 'Right-wing nutters' stop debt deal
A top British finance minister says the world's biggest economic threat is from “right-wing nutters” in Congress who would send the U.S. government into default.
Speaking to the BBC about the European rescue package for troubled Greece, U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable said Washington's political showdown over the debt ceiling threatens to overshadow financial troubles on the continent.
Story Continued Below
“The irony of the situation at the moment, with markets opening (Monday) morning, is that the biggest threat to the world financial system comes from a few right-wing nutters in the American congress rather than the euro zone,” Cable said on Sunday, Reuters reported.
Cable is the second-ranking member of the left-wing Liberal Democratic Party in Parliament. The Liberal Democrats joined Conservatives to form a coalition government after the 2010 British elections.
Cable drew controversy in December when they were caught on tape saying they were “ declaring war” on News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch. Prime Minister David Cameron then stripped Cable of their authority to rule over the News Corp. takeover of satellite broadcaster BSkyB and forced them to apologize.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many Australians are unsure about what material they can download for free
Nearly half of Australia's digital users illegally download movies, TV shows and music on a regular basis, a government survey has found.
Illegal downloads would lessen if content was cheaper and available at the same time as in other countries.
In comparison, the research found, a fifth of British digital users illegal downloaded at least one digital file.
The research comes amid an Australian government crackdown on digital copyright infringement.
It has amended the Copyright Act 1968 to block overseas websites that infringe copyright.
Movies popular
The survey by the Department of Communications was modelled on UK Government research that has been conducted since 2012.
Both countries conducted surveys between March and May this year to measure online copyright infringement across different content types.
At least 43% of online consumers had infringed online copyright, which represents 26% of all Australian internet users.
The survey of 2630 Australians found movies were the most illegally downloaded material, with 48% of those surveyed illegally downloading at least one movie during the three-month period.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Australians were quick to download The Dallas Buyers' Club, starring Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto
The Department of Communications said in a statement the best way to combat online infringements was for content creators to make their material easy to access, timely and affordable to consumers.
The body for the communications industry concurred with this.
"It is interesting that almost three quarters of those internet users who consumed content illegally were also accessing content legally," said Communications Alliance Chief Executive Officer John Stanton.
In April, an Australian court ordered internet service providers to hand over details of customers accused of illegally downloading US movie The Dallas Buyers Club .
Australians are among the world's most regular illegal downloaders of digital content.
The delay in release dates for new films and TV shows, and higher prices in Australia for digital content, have prompted many Australians to find surreptitious ways to watch new shows.

Are narcissists more likely to be right-wing conservatives or rebellious liberals? A study of narcissistic personalities reveals they typically combine elements of both, helping to explain some of President Trump's actions.
Social scientists have long tried to understand how personality influences political beliefs. Studies have found that people who are open-minded, creative and curious are more likely to be liberal voters, whereas people who like convention and orderliness tend to vote more conservatively.
But few studies have looked at how political attitudes are shaped by narcissism – a personality trait characterised by a sense of superiority, self-admiration and a lack of empathy for others.

Aleksandra Cichocka at the University of Kent, UK, and their team decided to look at two attitudes typically seen to be right-wing: a belief in social dominance – that inequality is the natural order of things – and in right-wing authoritarianism, the idea that traditional values need protecting.
Read more – All about me: How to be a successful narcissist
The team surveyed nearly 2000 people in the UK, US and Poland. To determine each person's level of narcissism, they asked them to choose which statements described them best, for example, “The thought of ruling the world frightens the hell out of me” versus “If I ruled the world it would be a better place”.
To gauge political attitudes, they asked participants to rate how strongly they agreed with statements like, “It is not a problem if some people have more of a chance in life than others” and “Trashy magazines and radical literature in our communities are poisoning the minds of our young people”.
Statements like “African Americans living here should not push themselves where they are not wanted” were included specifically to assess ethnic prejudice.
The higher people scored for narcissism, the higher they also tended to rate on measures of social dominance and ethnic prejudice. However, these people generally scored lower on authoritarianism.

This fits with research showing that narcissists are more preoccupied with being top of the pecking order than maintaining traditional morals, says Cichocka. In fact, they may deliberately undermine the status quo because they believe they are special and unique, they say. “Narcissists like to see themselves as rebellious and non-conforming as well as open to new experiences and creative,” they say.
“Displaying greater prejudice towards ethnic minority groups can be considered one way of how narcissists express their superiority strivings,” they say.
Trump seems to fit within this narcissistic framework, says Cichocka. “We see instances of them being highly socially dominant, but of course we also see them breaking social norms,” they say.
John Duckitt at the University of Auckland in New Zealand agrees. Trump's belief in social hierarchy is suggested by their preoccupation with ratings and racially charged comments, while their rule-breaking nature is evident in their unrestrained Twitter use, they say.
Narcissism in numbers
A person's political beliefs can also be affected by collective narcissism.
Collective narcissists have an exaggerated feeling that a group that they belong to is special, and they are highly sensitive to outside threats. A person can be a collective narcissist without themselves being an individual narcissist.
Agnieszka Golec de Zavala at Goldsmiths, University of London and their colleagues showed last year that people in Turkey who scored higher on the collective narcissism scale were more likely to feel humiliated by their country not being admitted to the European Union. They also felt more pleasure in the EU's recent economic problems.
The researchers also found that collective narcissists in Poland are more likely to support hostile actions against the makers of a film that portrayed their country in a bad light.
No studies have looked at whether collective narcissism is going up or down, but further research in this area could help to predict societal flare-ups, says Golec de Zavala. “Understanding the situations that mobilise collective narcissistic responses may help explain seemingly sudden and unprovoked outbursts of intergroup hostility.”

Not us. We're buckled in tight and loving the turbulent Plan B flightseeing trip over this wild place that's quietly known as the “Galapagos of the North,” even if not everyone loves the nickname or the growing attention that comes with it. But I desperately want to set foot on Gwaii Haanas, and the Inland Air Charters pilot is allowed one landing per trip, so when we spot a calm bay on the Pacific side, Grundmann swoops down and floats our plane to shore for a quick visit.

“This is crazy awesome,” enthuses Haida Watchman David Dixon as we scramble along a rocky shore in Gowgaia Bay, stopping to pick up a battered plastic wrapper that's surely debris from the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami debris. “This is my first time being here and I've been doing this for years, so we are very lucky.” Dixon, wearing a traditional Haida cedar hat that took them months to weave, was born here but works for an Indigenous catering company in Vancouver most of the year. When they first applied to be a Watchman, “there were bets on how, how long I would last — two weeks, two months — before going back to the city.” They love it. Traditionally, Haida Watchmen were posted at strategic spots around a village to raise the alarm if enemies approached. Now the Haida Gwaii Watchmen Program post guardians at five historic village sites on Gwaii Haanas from May to September, welcoming visitors while protecting the natural and cultural heritage. The Council of the Haida Nation works closely with Parks Canada, which issues permits to allow only 12 people to be at each village site at a time on “the islands of beauty.” The full name of this federally protected spot is Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, National Marine Conservation Area Reserve, and Haida Heritage Site. If that's hard to wrap your mind around, then so is the entire archipelago of Haida Gwaii. One of Canada's hottest emerging destinations, Haida Gwaii was renamed in 2010 from the Queen Charlotte Islands. It lingers in Canadian minds as the place where the Haida won a showdown against loggers over Lyell Island (now part of Gwaii Haanas) in the mid-1980s.
One of the most photographed spots on Graham Island, Haida Gwaii is Balance Rock, a nature-made wonder that can't be toppled. ( Jennifer Bain )
If the Isle of Arran is “Scotland in miniature,” then Haida Gwaii in Northern British Columbia should be considered “Canada in miniature” or, better yet, a perfect version of this country. With a population not quite reaching 5,000 and two main islands (Graham Island in the north and Moresby Island in the south, which includes Gwaii Haanas, plus about 150 smaller islands), this is a culturally and biologically rich place.

Rugged, primal, wild, spirited, fierce, mythic, and magical are the words most used for Haida Gwaii. Canadian artist Emily Carr came here twice for inspiration. There is storm watching, sea kayaking and surfing, totem poles and longhouses, mountains, rainforest and old-growth forest, seafood, seabirds and land animals, loggers, artists, environmentalists and hippies, plus an Edge of the World Music Festival to play on the edge-of-the-world appeal. “Bucket-list material for folks looking to connect with the planet,” Sarah Musgrave wrote in EnRoute magazine. Make that “connect with the planet while disconnecting with the modern world” since it's a shock to face minimal cell service and painfully slow Wi-Fi. There are tsunamis warning signs along the roads, though, urging people to go to higher ground or inland in case of an earthquake like the one in 2012 that was Canada's second largest. Haida Gwaii is our most earthquake-prone area and experts predict another large quake and tsunami are coming. Islanders have no choice but to be self-sufficient.
Storm watching is a thing on Haida Gwaii, but even when the weather is lovely, there are incredible things happening in the ocean. ( Jennifer Bain )
From the airport, I head straight into the woods to the Tow Hill/Blow Hole hike with Haida House guide Phred Collins, a builder, bird expert, “biologist-geologist of sorts and a lover of falcons.” Like all non-Haida people, they take extreme care with their language, saying things like “this is Haida land and I'm a settler here. Canada says this is Canada. The Haida say this is Haida Gwaii.” Collins talks with great passion about Haida Gwaii and warns “it's very difficult to absorb it all,” and “we're dealing with a different paradigm here,” in a place where people “are willing to stand up for the land, the landscape.” We marvel at Western red cedar, Sitka spruce, Western hemlock, red alder and moss-covered trees that provide homes for rare birds. We try salal berries. Collins details the “seasonal species matrix” that makes this Canada's Galapagos. They warn that we must write about the realities of this place and “ensure we don't turn Haida Gwaii into Disneyland.” Like all islands, the fact that Haida Gwaii is so far from the mainland (an eight-hour ferry ride from Prince Rupert) lets distinct sub species thrive. Collins shows me my first banana slug, a thumb-sized creature I learn later from Parks Canada's Cohen Isberg “are kind of the unknown hero of our forest floor.” Banana slugs eat dead leaves and plant material, turn them into rich soil, and create nurse logs (fallen trees that decay and support other plants and creatures). “Banana slugs are part of the reason we have such beautiful forests,” says Isberg on the Spirit Lake Trail's moss-carpeted forest and admiring “cultural plant enclosures” and “culturally modified trees” used by the Haida for things like canoes, totem poles and medicine.
Some may recoil, but this banana slug was the coolest thing I saw on Haida Gwaii. ( Jennifer Bain )
The learning is non-stop. “This is the wild West Coast. It's pretty temperamental,” says Shawn Cowpar, co-owner of Haida Style Expeditions, on a boat cruise where I hear about the rhythm and dangers of the ocean tides and watch a feisty young bear travel the shoreline. At Haida chef Roberta Olson's home-based Keenawaii's Kitchen, I have a family-style local feast with venison, berries, salmon and seaweed. I can't get enough k'aaw — herring roe that spawns on kelp and is fried in butter. My last day is spent walking the Golden Spruce Trail, driving logging roads and exploring the forest and coastline with Dale Lore, a former logger and former local mayor turned tour guide and medicine/food forager with 10,000 hours spent walking the Haida Gwaii forest. “I was pretty friggin' redneck. It was pretty embarrassing,” admits Lore, who repeatedly stresses that their tours explain history not culture and the goal is “to have you appreciate what these people are and achieved and did.” It's an important distinction for a non-Haida to make, especially when Lore leads me into the woods where a huge Haida canoe being carved out of a cedar tree lies moss-covered and abandoned, likely due to a smallpox epidemic. “I can walk into 22 of these canoes,” boasts Lore. “Another 10 to 15 haven't been found. The logging companies got rid of the rest.”

Lore unpacks all kinds of hard-earned wisdom, which they call “my truth, my whole truth and nothing but my whole truth.” The best, which is true here and everywhere, is this one: “The more you learn, the stupider you feel.” To visit Haida Gwaii, they figure, you need at least 10 days to even begin to understand it. “An amazing number of people around the world want to get here,” says Lore. I'm one of them, but only have five days so can't even pretend to understand it, only to love it and want to know it better. Jennifer Bain was hosted by Destination British Columbia and the Northern B.C. Tourism Association, which didn't review or approve this story. When you go: Get there: I flew Air Canada to Vancouver and took Pacific Coastal Airlines the next morning from the Vancouver International Airport (YVR) South Terminal to Masset on Haida Gwaii. Get around: Some lodges offer all-inclusive packages, but otherwise a car rental gives the most freedom. Book well in advance as vehicles are limited. Stay: I stayed at luxury ecolodge Haida House at Tllaal (haidahouse.com) where the meals are fantastic and the beach is minutes away. It specializes in all-inclusive Haida culture and adventure packages. I stayed at the Fairmont Vancouver Airport (fairmont.com) on either end of my trip. It's inside YVR and my soundproofed room overlooked planes at their gates and came with a plane spotting guide. Eat: The Haida House at Tllaal Dining Room is open to the public for meals. I also had a family-style meal at Haida chef Roberta Olson's Keenawaii's Kitchen (find it on Facebook, reservation only, February to September) in Skidegate. Jags Beanstalk (jagsbeanstalk.com) in Skidegate has a bistro and espresso bar as well as guest rooms.

SAN FRANCISCO: Donald Trump has promised to liven up this year's Republican National Convention. But some of America's biggest corporations are bailing on the party.Apple recently became the latest company to give the GOP's presumptive nominee the cold shoulder; it won't contribute money or products to the Republicans' big shindig in Cleveland this month.HP Inc is also withholding support, while Microsoft is giving products only, not cash. Beyond the tech industry, Ford, JPMorgan Chase and United Parcel Service have opted to withhold support.Most of these companies are also taking a pass on donating to the 2016 Democratic convention. In previous election cycles, though, several of them have given Republican organisers more sometimes far more in cash or donated products than they have the Democrats, making their pullback from the Republican gathering this year more dramatic.The reasons aren't completely clear. None of these companies publicly described its decisions as a. Several declined to discuss their thinking, while others said their sponsorship plans were decided months before Trump emerged as the front-runner for the GOP nomination.An anti-Trump protester holds protest sign in Cleveland. (Reuters photo)In many cases, however, their decisions became known after civil rights groups launched a public effort including billboards, letters and online messages aimed at persuading companies to withhold support for an event celebrating a candidate who's campaigned with incendiary proposals,and harsh comments about immigrants and women."Of course it's because of," said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who has studied party conventions for more than 30 years. Business executives, they said, don't want to alienate customers who may be offended by Trump's statements. "Just as candidates don't get votes from people they insult," they said, "corporations don't get business from people they insult."Even so, Republican convention organisers say their fundraising is going well. More than 100 donors have contributed a total of US $57.5 million, or about 90 per cent of what's needed, said Emily Lauer of the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee. They declined to provide a list of sponsors. Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.
Rabat, Morocco - Morocco's Islamic Justice and Development Party (PJD) has emerged as the winner after the country voted for its 10th parliament since independence in 1956, according to official results.
PJD, which has been running a coalition government since 2011, won 125 seats, while the opposition Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM) came second, with 102 seats, the interior ministry said on Saturday after all ballots were counted.

The Istiqlal (Independence) Party - the oldest in the country, founded in 1944 - came third by winning 46 seats, following by National Rally of Independents (RNI) with 37 seats, and Popular Movement (MP) with 27.
'Day of joy'
The results represented a strong message of support for the ruling PJD, despite opposition criticism that the Islamic party had failed to achieve tangible results in its five years of power.
"This is a day of joy and a victory for democracy," Abdelilah Benkirane, PJD secretary-general and outgoing prime minister, told their supporters after the announcement of the results.
"The Moroccan people have rewarded PJD for the work we did in our previous term," they said.
PAM spokesperson Khaled Adnoun said they were pleased with the outcome of the election and ruled out any kind of cooperation with PJD.
"We are happy with the results, though we were expecting to grab more seats. However, we did better this time than in 2011," Adnoun said.
"As said before by PAM secretary-general, there will be no cooperation of whatever with PJD."
According to the terms of the 2011 constitution, the prime minister is selected from the party that receives the most votes in the election.
With PJD winning most seats in the 395-member House of Representatives, King Mohammed VI is likely to invite them to lead a new coalition government for a second consecutive term, the first party in the modern history of the kingdom to do so.

PJD will now reach out to other parties to form a coalition government, because the multi-party system in the kingdom makes it impossible for any political party to win an absolute majority.
Voting went smoothly in general, with a surprisingly weak turnout of over 43 percent.
Missing voters Voter turnout in Morocco is generally poor. On the whole, about 50 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots both in local (municipal and regional polls) and national elections (parliament). Voter turnout in the 2015 local elections was 53.67 percent, up from approximately 45 percent in the 2011 parliamentary vote.
The low voter engagement is widely considered a message of disappointment to political parties, which remain unable to motivate the country's citizens, and especially the youth.
Speaking to Al Jazeera, many citizens expressed their resentment on the poor performance of the previous governments and the country's politicians, who remain unable to touch on their daily problems.
"We need employment, decent accommodation, a good health system and better education. Corruption in the country, which remains widespread in both the public and business spheres, has to end as well," a senior bank officer, told Al Jazeera.
Voters talking to Al Jazeera generally agreed on their expectations from the elections.
Many expect from the next government to alleviate the situation of healthcare, education and find a new mechanism to generate employment, which remain major social challenges that previous governments failed to handle.
According to the World Bank, more than one-fifth of young people are out of work.
THE inferiority complex that afflicts soccer in this country has been on full display in the past two weeks with the usual pattern of fans tarnishing the sport with their violent antics and then blaming the media for daring to report on the lawlessness.
The violence may be perpetrated by a tiny minority of thugs but the wider soccer community's propensity to play the victim and pretend that the sport's ugly underbelly is a figment of the media's imagination is integral to holding back the competition. Too often the soccer community appears far more outraged by the criticism of the hooligan minority than the antics of the hooligan minority.
Soccer is doomed to remain a second tier sport in Australia if administrators don't take serious steps to stamp out the anti-social elements that continue to plague the A-League. Last week the FFA charged both Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers with bringing the game into disrepute after brawls before, during and after their December 28 clash.
The clubs have until 5pm today to appeal against the sanction; the deduction of three competition points suspended until the conclusion of the 2013/14 season. However the suspended penalty is "subject to the proper conduct of supporters for that period", meaning that if either set of fans stuff-up again this season, their team will lose competition points.
A-League chief Damien de Bohun has warned fans that there'll be tougher sanctions to come if they don't moderate their behaviour.
"It's time to say enough is enough," they said. "We are saying that maintaining the Hyundai A-League as a safe, family friendly environment is of paramount importance. It's number one."
One can understand why the head honchos have had enough. The footage of Wanderers and Victory fans rioting in the Melbourne CBD armed with metal poles was a new low. Quite an effort given that last year soccer fans disgraced themselves by destroying 170 seats at Etihad Stadium during a Victory v Heart derby.
The latest trouble started hours before the game with fans setting off flares, pelting each other with rocks, bottles, chairs and other debris before Wanderers supporters marched to AAMI Park, with a heavy police escort, chanting obscenities. Can you imagine what a tourist witnessing this spectacle would have thought?
There was more trouble at the game with no less than five flares set off with one coming close to the field of play. And the bedlam didn't stop there with police forced to intervene to separate fans after the match. So far two men have been charged but remarkably, despite the unruly behaviour of hundreds, only eight were ejected during the game.
Police have acknowledged that soccer troublemakers behave differently from fans of other sports and pose challenges that they do not face with footy or cricket crowds. It appears that authorities treat soccer supporters differently too, with a leniency that is lacking in other sports. If you throw a beachball at the cricket you are escorted out of the stadium to chants of "you're going home in the back of a divvy van" but you can pelt security with bottles and coins, as happened in a 2012 Melbourne derby, and police will retreat rather than take on a maddened mob.
The police verdict on the unique issues confronting the sport may be a case of stating the obvious but it is news that many within the soccer fraternity refuse to acknowledge, maintaining that crowd behaviour is no worse than at AFL games and that the media is to blame for "beating up" stories of misconduct.
That is a falsehood so comically deluded that it shouldn't need a rebuttal. The truth is that if any of those incidents occurred in the AFL, the coverage would be significantly greater. The smallest misstep in footy receives saturation coverage.
Imagine the breadth of coverage if it was Carlton fans that destroyed dozens of stadium seats or lit flares that endangered life and limb. Or if it was Collingwood fans that rioted in the streets with their faces covered and armed with makeshift weapons. And can you envision the outcry if Port Adelaide fans needed a police escort to attend a game?
A story on Brendan Fevola tweeting "crawl back under your rock" to a website operator was the most read item on the Herald Sun website just over a week ago - imagine if they aren't retired. And yesterday Essendon was contacted for comment after being linked to an increase in peptide use among young men even though the club had no knowledge and could not reasonably be held responsible for the actions of a few gym junkies.
Delusional soccer folk also believe that other codes are terrified of their sport becoming the biggest game in town. But for all the talk of its supposed popularity, soccer's TV ratings are minuscule and dwarfed by just about every other major sport. The highest rating A-League game last weekend had 83,000 viewers on free to air TV and 94,000 watching on payTV. Contrast that with the Ashes 1,550,000, Big Bash League 681,000 and tennis's Brisbane International, 260,000.
The fact that a meaningless, hit and giggle form of cricket achieves ratings that the A-League can only dream of illustrates the gap between the sport and rival competitions. One look at the BBL crowd, full of families and young children, and you can understand why the FFA is keen to eliminate the ugly minority that continue to damage the game.

Sleeping with the Enemy cozies right up to the hard truth that abusers are everywhere.
Every domestic thriller is the sequel to a romantic comedy. Romantic comedies reward impulsive, boundary-smashing gestures and unflagging perseverance; thrillers check in on the kinds of couples created by such careless disregard for personal space. With just a little tweaking, it's easy to imagine Julia Roberts's abusive millionaire husband in 1991's Sleeping with the Enemy as the same character played by Richard Gere in Pretty Woman a year earlier, climbing toward Roberts up the fire escape, a bouquet of roses clenched in their teeth.
Pretty Woman did for romantic comedies what Fatal Attraction did for domestic thrillers, and it made a star of Roberts; their way of, as Janet Maslin put it, “smiling shyly with every particle of their being” spun the most cynical meet-cute of the nineties into something as fresh and naive as a Downy ad. Sleeping with the Enemy, a grim and purposeful little film, positively warps around their radiant vulnerability. Directed by Joseph Ruben from a much flimsier script than their 1987 domestic horror film The Stepfather, Sleeping with the Enemy opens on Laura Burney (Roberts) and their asupervisorstioned rich, violent husband Martin (Patrick Bergin) in their chilly modernist vacation home in Cape Cod. Laura fakes their death to escape their brutal beatings and coercive intimacy, starting a new life under an alias in small-town Iowa; Martin discovers the fraud and tracks them down to the inevitable confrontation.
The horror of the early scenes is real, partly because Roberts mixes Laura's raw fear with disgust, boredom, and a granite determination to get out. The cycles of Martin's abuse are predictable to Laura by now, but no less terrifying to her; we watch them try to keep calm and stave off catastrophe as it begins with obsessive-compulsive towel-straightening, escalates to jealous accusations, and ends with their curled up on the floor. The coda to this nauseating routine is sex to the strains of Martin's favorite Berlioz CD.
Yet the real horror begins in the second act, when Laura meets Ben (Kevin Anderson), the bearded, floppy-haired drama teacher of Cedar Falls, Iowa. Roger Ebert called Sleeping with the Enemy “a movie that briefly seems to have greatness in its grasp, and goes straight for the mundane,” and I agree; the potential for greatness, in my opinion, lies in the film's seemingly subconscious depiction of Ben as an abuser-to-be.
Ben is lit like a serial killer, popping up behind Laura at night as they pick their apples, threatening them with arrest and then trying to barter their terror into a date. When they don't take the bait, they follow them to their kitchen door, suggesting they bake them a pie in return for being allowed to come over for a pot-roast dinner, which they promptly burn. Ben's modus operandi is to unsettle and surprise Laura wherever possible, always keeping them a little off-balance. Their idea of a magical first date involves leading her, blindfolded, into the drama department after hours, setting them up on a pitch-black stage, and then watching from the audience as they turn on a spotlight. They fidget nervously, unsure whether she's about to be filmed, or possibly murdered; it's all very romantic. When fake snow starts falling instead of a rain of bullets, the Stockholm syndrome takes full effect and Laura hugs herself, giggling with glee.
But for viewers, the torture has only just begun, as the dream date proceeds to a montage of Laura trying on costume-department hats to “Brown-Eyed Girl.” (I tried to count the hats; I gave up around fifteen.) Even as Roberts tries valiantly to turn this into a scene from one of their bubbly romantic comedies, Ben acts creepier and creepier. They seduce them to the opening lines of “Runaround Sue”—yes, that's right, a song about sexual jealousy for a survivor of a jealous abuser—and then dances their dizzy, hoisting them into the air and yanking their back and forth like a rag doll. Back at their house, they push Laura onto the stairs for a make-out session that looks like hell on the back. Triggered by their sexual aggressiveness, Laura tells them to stop, but eventually has to throw them off.
The film begs us to forgive floppy-haired Ben—Laura always does, of course—even as it places them time and again in Martin's role. Ben's sudden, looming presence in Laura's personal space provides not one, not two, but three jump-scares, which is a lot even for a movie without a cat. The film even aligns Ben with Martin's mustache-twirling music cue. When Ben asks Laura if they like classical music, they answer truthfully, “Anything but Berlioz. Their Symphonie fantastique gives me chills.” “Thanks for the tip,” Ben leers. At perhaps the climax of the Ben-Martin mind meld, Ben reads to their drama students from Chekhov's The Seagull as Martin, hot on Laura's trail, watches hidden in the wings; it's Treplev's speech to Nina, professing their undying, obsessive love to her, saying they hate and loves them and begging them to stay. Yet Ben remains the unfired gun of Sleeping with the Enemy's third act, and in the end, Laura embraces them over Martin's bloodied body, eager, with every bit of tremulous faith Julia Roberts can muster, to start the cycle anew.
Ever since Fatal Attraction's stellar first act, domestic thrillers have all had to decide whether to devote time to the “honeymoon period,” whose crucial insights about falling in love with a serial boundary-violator always risk slowing a film down. In cutting this intro in favor of a new meet-cute in the second act, Sleeping with the Enemy comes close, closer than any other domestic abuse thriller I've seen, to acknowledging that the aftereffects of trauma go beyond a lifelong aversion to Berlioz. Its cozies right up to the hard truth that abusers are everywhere, even Iowa. But in the end it falls back asleep.

Ready to watch the first new Game of Thrones scene since last year's finale?
The above is a never-before-seen scene from season 5, a deleted outtake included on the HBO hit's upcoming DVD and Blu-ray set.
The footage has the Night's Watch's menacing Master-at-Arms Ser Alliser Thorne (Owen Teale) and captured Wildling Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju) tensely squaring off in the courtyard at Castle Black.
The scene, cut from last season's fifth episode, highlights the Night's Watch internal power struggle over how to treat the migrating Wildling army that — spoiler alert for those are not caught up — leads to Thorne orchestrating the death of Lord Commander Jon Snow (Kit Harington). Notice Thorne's very subtle lip curl when Tormond taunts them about no longer being in charge.
Bonus: Tormund actually makes a joke! (“Mutton's a bit tough.”)
The Thrones season 5 DVD and Blu-ray is out March 15 — more than a month before season 6 premieres on April 24. The set contains the complete season, along with deleted scenes, audio commentaries, a documentary on the real-life European history that inspired Thrones author George R.R. Martin, a deep-dive documentary into the season finale.
Previously, EW posted an excerpt from the season 5 DVD commentary where writer Bryan Cogman gives a heartfelt defense of the controversial Sansa wedding night scene.
The Abu Sayyaf armed group has released three Indonesian hostages in the southern Philippines a day after freeing a Norwegian captive held for a year and repeatedly threatened with beheading.
Sunday's release - negotiated by the Moro National Liberation Front rebels - took place on the island of Jolo in Sulu province.
Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, who was let go on Saturday, described the ordeal as "devastating", carrying a backpack with a bullet hole as a reminder of a near-death experience, which included the decapitations of two Canadians kidnapped with him.
The three Indonesian hostages were identified as Lorence Koten, Theorus Kopong, and Emanuel Arakain. They were abducted from the Sabah state of Malaysia in July.

Sekkingstad, 56, said after their release they were treated "like a slave" by the group, which is linked to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS).
"[I was] always kept in the dark and given misinformation, like, not reliable information, psychological pressure like: 'You gonna be beheaded [on] such and such a date' - always threats hanging over your head," they said.
Sekkingstad, newly shaved but looking gaunt in a loose polo shirt, thanked all those who worked for their freedom.
"I am very happy to be alive and free," they said. "It's a beautiful feeling."
Abu Ramie, a spokesperson for Abu Sayyaf, said the group received a $638,000 ransom for Sekkingstad's release. The government of the Philippines said it did not pay the group and was unaware of any payment made by other parties.
Inside Abu Sayyaf: Blood, drugs and conspiracies
Sekkingstad was abducted from a luxury tourist resort in September 2015 alongside a Filipina woman, who has already been freed, and the two Canadian men.
Abu Sayyaf demanded a huge ransom for the release of the foreigners, and released videos in which they threatened the captives in a jungle clearing where they displayed ISIL-style black flags.
In April and June, the Canadians - John Ridsdel , 68, and Robert Hall , 67 - were beheaded after ransoms were not paid, while the Filipina, Marites Flor, was released.
After they decapitated Ridsdel, Sekkingstad was threatened by the fighters, who repeatedly told him, "You're next."
Duterte has deployed 7,000 troops to Sulu to go after Abu Sayyaf.
The United States and the Philippines have separately blacklisted the group as a "terrorist" organisation for bombings, extortion, kidnappings for ransom, and beheadings of locals and foreigners.
After their mutual parting of ways with Super Arcade earlier this year, Level|Up Series has stepped back from putting on regular tournaments to refocus their attention on larger events like SoCal Regionals. Fortunately, it appears as if they are looking to jump back into weekly events, though the platform may be a bit different than expected.
During a special broadcast this evening, Level|Up president and longtime community member Alex Valle opened up about their next venture. While still under the Wednesday Night Fights banner they made famous over the past few years, these new events will instead focus on netplay competition instead of offline meetings.
Wednesday Night Fights Online Edition came about as a way for Level|Up Series to continue their tradition of consistent tournament action without fragmenting the strong Southern California scene. By moving online, players across the country will be allowed to take part, improve their game, and possibly get their names out there in preparation for the huge rewards available at next year's Capcom Cup.
Much in the way the original Wednesday Night Fights brought a piece of the old arcade days to present-day competition, Valle is hoping to show that online play is a valuable resource for the community as a whole.
Valle wasn't able to provide too many details apart from what's described above, but they did drop one teasing tagline before signing off: “Wednesday Night Fights Online Edition is coming to a home near you.”
We're sure to be given more information in the near future but, until then, feel free to let us know what you think of this shift in Level|Up's focus in the comments below.

The select committee reviewing the equal marriage bill in New Zealand, has heard submissions from two pastors, one who called equal marriage a sin, and an “abomination,” and another who said that incest is “the way it could go” if equal marriage became legal.
The New Zealand Marriage Amendment Bill, which would legalise equal marriage, passed its first reading on 22 August, with a majority of 80 votes to 40 in parliament in support of the change.
A select committee is now reviewing the bill, which would normally be over a period of around six months. After that process, it will make a decision on whether or not to recommend it be passed.
Graham Sunderland, a pastor at Rivestones Church in Upper Hutt, spoke to the committee, saying that they agreed with equal rights, but not in terms of relationships, reported 3NZ. Mr Sunderland said:
“Are we going to see in the future that a brother and sister can get married? I mean, that's the way it could go.”
They said that they thought marriages must be exclusively between one man and one woman, and that its purpose is procreation. They went on to say:
“If you crack an egg in half, you have two shells which can then come together and form one.
“A car is not a truck, they both have motors and wheels but they both have very different roles,” they say.
Masterton Baptist Church pastor, Scott Lelievre, also submitted to the committee, and said that they thought that equal marriage “lowers the prestige” of marriage.
They said that they were speaking the word of god, and on behalf of their congregation, and that they meant no offence. They said:
“As far as we are aware, marriage outside of this, is a marriage of sin. The government does not have the right to change this.”
They said he, and other church officials feared persecution if they were to be forced to officiate same-sex marriages.
“If we have to go to jail, then we have to go to jail. We are against this and urge government to vote this down. The church needs a voice and we need to point toward God who is the creator of all things.”
“The vast majority of churches will accept the stance I have given you now. The state is trying to be God. The state is changing marriage beyond recognition and is enough trouble as it is.
“This will add to the weakening of marriage. It will lower the prestige of marriage. It is adding something that is a sin to something that is of God. God says it is a sin.”
MP Gordon Copeland was criticised for their submission to the select committee last week, and was accused of comparing same-sex marriage to apartheid in South Africa.
Veteran actor Sir Ian McKellen recently criticised New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, for mocking the host of a radio show for wearing a red jumper, which they said was “a bit gay”.
The committee continues to take submissions.
Bajaj is all set to bring in the VS400 in our market this November. The VS400 will launch under the new "Kratos" brand from Bajaj which will sit above the immensely popular "Pulsar" brand.
According to sources, this new motorcycle will be labelled the Kratos VS400, where the ‘VS' stands for Vantage Sport. It derives inspiration from the likes of the Ducati Diavel, in terms of styling as well as ergonomics. However, unlike the Diavel – which is a power-cruiser or muscle-bike if you will, the Kratos VS400 will be a smaller, more accessible bike that is more touring-focused. While plenty of camouflaged test mules have been spotted around Pune these images are the first of an undisguised VS400 that our reader shared with us.
Aesthetically, it is interesting to see that there are no significant changes from the concept shown at Auto Expo 2014. As can be seen from these images, in terms of styling, the KratosVS400 does not adopt a conventional cruiser look, but instead, aims at being a modern hybrid between a cruiser and a street fighter. Staying true to its low stance, it sports a slightly raked-out front end that is adept for highway cruising, but to a lesser degree than you would expect to see on most regular cruisers. The front cowl is pretty neatly designed, with a swept-back visor and an all-new LED headlight setup. Although the model first displayed at the Auto Expo sporting USD forks up front, the production version will come equipped with regular telescopic forks instead. The rear will come shod with a mono-shock setup as witnessed on the bike first shown.
In these pictures, the split instrument cluster can be seen clearly. The handlebar-mounted unit is a sleek and rugged design that seems to house an LCD display, while the tank-mounted unit has all the tell-tale lights. This will also be the first time a motorcycle from Bajaj will sport an all-digital instrument cluster. It all looks well put-together, except for the key slot, which sticks out sorely at the handlebar.
The tank looks muscular and sports contours that appear to have been inspired from the older Bajaj 200 NS. All of these flows quite well into the nice long seat that looks to be ideal for those stretched-out saddle hours. You can see that the rider's seat is deep and generous, and the pillion seat is reasonably wide too. The tail section is upswept and ends abruptly, and the tail-lamps have the signature Pulsar twin-slash LED setup, similar to what the Diavel sports. However, in these images the Kratos VS400 looks a bit busy when viewed from the rear. The bike will have a fairly chunky box-section swing-arm which should with a long-ish wheelbase to aid in high-speed stability. Of course, this could sacrifice flickability and light-weight, but we still have to see what this all-new chassis from Bajaj is all about.
Also, it is interesting to see that Bajaj has opted to steer away from the expensive Metzeler rubber used on the KTMs. The Metzeler's life tends to be in the nine-12,000km range. We expect these MRF Revz C1 tyres to offer less in terms of outright grip, but will strike a better balance between performance and life for the intended cruiser market.
Similar to what Bajaj did with the KTM 200 and Pulsar 200 motors, the Kratos VS400's engine will be derived from the fuel-injected, liquid-cooled, 373cc single-cylinder mill from the KTM 390s. Apart from the basic engine structure, the Bajaj version will have a different setup in a different state of tune, to better suit its touring purposes. While incorporating Bajaj's signature triple-spark technology, the Kratos VS400 is expected to produce about 40hp of peak power and around 30Nm of torque, which will be transferred to the rear wheel through a six-speed gearbox. Even though its power output will be down from the KTM 390's 44hp, the VS400 is expected to have more tractable power for low-speed usability and highway cruising.
Distinctive song sets Lombok owl apart
Updated
Scientists have identified a new species of owl that they believe exists only on one island in Indonesia.
The owl looks similar to another common Indonesian owl, the Moluccan scops owl, with brown and white feathers and golden eyes.
But it has a distinctive territorial song, which the researchers describe as "a single whistle without pronounced overtones".
Researchers from Sweden and the United States have named the species, found in the foothills of Mount Rinjani on the island of Lombok, the Rinjani scops owl.
After 10 years of work verifying their claim, they have now published their findings in the latest edition of PLos One.
The Lombok owls were first categorised in 1896. Then, the German ornithologist Ernst Hartert described the cry as "a clear but not very loud 'pwok'."
Because of their appearance, they were long believed to belong to the same species as the Moluccan scops owl, which is widespread on other Indonesian islands.
But in 2003, while carrying out research on another bird on Lombok, two scientists noticed their songs were different to what they had heard just weeks earlier on the island of Flores.
Scientists determined the birds' species by playing recordings of the owl songs into the forest.
The Lombok owls did not react to the song of the Moluccan scops owl or the call of another bird, Wallace's scops owl.
However, when the researchers played recordings they had taped on Lombok, the birds responded by singing and approaching the loudspeaker.
Owls, like many other birds, do not learn different calls. Instead, scientists believe their distinctive calls have a genetic basis and so can be used to distinguish species from each other.

Isco: On the verge of signing new Malaga deal, says club chief
The new deal would strike a major blow to City's hopes of signing the attacking midfielder, with reports in Spain claiming they will commit to Malaga until June 2018, with a buyout clause of €35million (£30m) included in the contract.
Isco, whose full name is Francisco Roman Alarcon Suarez, is believed to have a €21m (£17m) release clause in their current deal.
The 20-year-old has been linked with a host of top European clubs including City and Serie A giants Juventus.
But Husillos says the Spain youth international is ready to commit to the Primera Liga club.
They said: "Isco's contract renewal is in its advanced stages and should be signed shortly.
"We will be here presenting Isco very soon. We will be here shortly to announce the renewal of their contract.
"It's not renewed as yet, but I think it will be very shortly. We understand it is virtually a done deal."
Husillos added: "There are no sure things in football. Everything can change in an instant.
"The club's intention and what Isco has stated is that they are going to stay here; he's going to renew their contract.
"Life can also throw up a lot of surprises. That is the most conclusive statement that the club can make on the issue."
Husillos admits it will be tough for Malaga to keep hold of Isco as their stock continues to rise and expects them to eventually join one of Europe's heavyweights.
"Isco has really taken off. He's a great player and they want them at a number of clubs," they added.
"He's a Spanish international. We intend to keep them at Málaga for as long as possible.
"Everyone wants to improve and if they continue growing like this, he'll have to go to a legendary European club. That's understandable."
George Lange Photography Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams first opened in Columbus, Ohio, in 2002
I remember the first time I had gelato. It was the early '80s. My standard, like everybody else's was Häagen-Dazs, with its dazzling umlauts. Then I had gelato, so creamy, rich and intense, half ice cream and half mousse, and the world became a bigger, better place. I had a similar experience at an ice cream parlor in Columbus, Ohio, the other day. And soon, you're going to have it too, I hope, as its trailblazing owner tries to change the way the artisanal-food game is played.
Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams is not a big business. But it's not a tiny, one-storefront business either. There are seven stores in the Columbus area right now, with two more in the works, including one in Cleveland. And there is a vigorous online business, which I will direct you to right now, before you even read another line. No, go ahead. I'll wait. I recommend the dark chocolate and the Meyer lemon yogurt. Also the coffee, which tastes uncannily like fresh coffee smells, and the wildberry lavender. Or get a couple of the seasonal ones. I'll be here. (Read "Six Things I Want to Eat in 2011.")
It's not like Jeni's is a secret; it's been on the Food Network several times, I'm told, and has a large cult following among Ohio émigrés and ice cream geeks. What distinguishes Jeni's is the success the company is having, given the methods it uses. "We've all been led to believe that there's this ideal of mom-and-pop businesses," says Jeni Britton Bauer, who opened their first store in 2002. "But having been a mom-and-pop business for many years, I can tell you, you can't do it very long. You get burned out; you give bad customer service. But most of all, you can't make ice cream from scratch when you're mom and pop. You have to be pretty big to get a pasteurizer." (Jeni's in-house machine uses a special method of low-temperature pasteurization that makes a huge difference in taste.) (See pictures of what the world eats.)
Making ice cream from scratch is a serious undertaking, even for artisanal producers. It's labor-intensive, very expensive and requires a lot of specialized heavy equipment, to say nothing of a major conduit of milk directly from the supplier. (Most ice cream manufacturers, even small-batch ones, just use a premade mix they then add flavors to.) You've heard this story before: tiny company makes wonderful product using method alien to evil corporate rival; tiny company vows to keep at it even if it never makes a dime. There's usually a twee, antiquarian sensibility about it, maybe you grow a handlebar moustache and print a label with an ancient letterpress. Painstakingly (and conspicuously) sourced ingredients, laborious production methods and most importantly a supportive circle of buyers  preferably in somewhere like Brooklyn or Portland, Ore.  completes the picture. There's just one universal law: you can't be expected to make any real money. As a recent article in food-snob bible Edible Brooklyn boasted of its subjects, "none of these entrepreneurs is looking to be the next Mrs. Fields or Ben & Jerry's. Part of what sets this artisan boomlet apart from other start-ups is that the goal is to make a living  not a killing." Real profit, in this narrative, needs be ceded to the corporations.
Except that, as Jeni's is proving, it doesn't. "Growth is good," Britton Bauer says. "The bigger we get, the better our ice cream can be." They don't expect to be a national force tomorrow, but there's no hard limit to where they want to go, which is good. I've written about ice cream before, how the high end seems to grow and get better, and the great broad middle segment hardly seems to have changed since Kirstie Alley was hot. Now that there's an ice cream that's as far above Häagen-Dazs as Häagen-Dazs is above Dolly Madison, can these freezer bricks, with their industrial-grade ingredients, unpronounceable stabilizers and low, low, low price points hold out? Häagen-Dazs invented the premium ice cream category, as it's called in the trade, by cutting the amount of air they cut your ice cream with and giving you all the butterfat you secretly longed for. But It's founder, Reuben Mattus, was not an especially avid student of the art and science of dairy. (And their archrivals Ben and Jerry were just two hippies who had taken a correspondence course on ice cream.) Jeni Britton Bauer, on the other hand, has never done anything but work on ice cream, think about ice cream and take ice cream to places where it has never gone. If they can become a success, and it looks like they can, there may yet be hope for all those tiny, perfect products  the micro-distilled spirits, the handmade cheeses, the bean-to-bar chocolates  that currently exist only in gourmet ghettos. After all, there was a time when gelato was unknown in America's supermarkets too.
See how culinary culture became a pop phenomenon.
Made In USA
The Converse “Chuck Taylor” All Star is the classic American sneaker. Since its origins in the early 20th century, chucks had always been made in the USA, and so the anouncement in January, 2001 by the Converse Company that they were declaring bankruptcy and halting all manufacture of Chuck Taylors and other products in North America was upsetting to many people. The new owners of Converse are continuing to manufacture Chucks Taylor shoes but only overseas in Asia. In 2003, Nike, Inc. purchased Converse from the interim owners. What is the significance and importance of these changes?
The basketball shoe is an American invention and yet almost the entire manufacturing base for athletic shoes is now elsewhere. For many years, the manufacturing of Chuck Taylor shoes continued to hold out against this trend, and was the only major name brand to still be made primarily in the USA. Many people bought chucks to support our American manufacturing base.
Too many inventions developed in this country are no longer made here. Think for instance of the television set and the video cassette recorder. Most of the clothing items you buy in a store are no longer made here, also. Now Converse “Chuck Taylor” All Stars have gone they way of these other products.
When you purchase an American-made product, you are supporting American labor and not foreign sweatshops, where employees and even children labor for sub par wages on a quota system six days a week, and if they don't meet their quota they must work on Sunday to keep their job. Many people bought chucks to support American labor and because they are opposed to products made using sweatshop labor. Luckily, no reports of chucks being made in sweatshop conditions have emerged so far.
If sneakers can be manufactured so cheaply overseas, why are they so expensive? Where does your money go? Unfortunately in many cases your money goes to hard sell advertising and endorsement campaigns, overpaid rich athletes, large corporate profits, and the commercialization of sports. For many people, purchasing and wearing chucks is a protest against the outrageous prices that come with the “latest” sneakers. The argument is often given that chucks are one of the best values in athletic shoes, due to their reasonable price. Do you think the manufacture of chucks in Asia will lower the price? Think again. The price is now around $55.00 retail, and many of the special seasonal models have prices of $60.00, $65.00, $75.00 or more.
We live in a time and place where products from all over the world are easily available and many are selling at very low prices. While that has its benefits, it usually is not a reciprocal arrangement, and the US trade deficit is testiment to that. There are times when consumers want to spend their money to support the local economy, and it is important to be able to purchase products made here, if so desired. It's too bad that chucks have now gone the way of other sneaker brands.
Well perhaps there is one small benefit, if you had the foresight to stock up on “Made in USA” Chuck Taylors. They continue to go up in value as collectors' items.

"The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner" is a short story by Alan Sillitoe, published in 1959 as part of a short story collection of the same name. The work focuses on Smith, a poor Nottingham teenager from a dismal home in a working class area, who has bleak prospects in life and few interests beyond petty crime. The boy turns to long-distance running as a method of both an emotional and a physical escape from their situation. The story was adapted for a 1962 film of the same title.
Plot [ edit ]
When they are caught by the police for robbing a bakery, Smith is sentenced to be confined in Ruxton Towers in Essex, a borstal (prison school) for delinquent youths. Taken there in handcuffs and detained in bleak and highly restrictive circumstances, they seek solace in long-distance running, attracting the notice of the school's authorities for their physical prowess. Smith is offered a light workload for their last six months at Ruxton Towers if they win in an important cross-country competition against a prestigious public school. For Ruxton Towers to win the cross-country race would be a major public relations boost for the borstal administrators.
However, when the day of the race arrives Smith throws victory away: after speeding ahead of the other runners they deliberately stop a few metres short of the finishing line, though well ahead and easily able to win. They let the other runners pass them and cross the finishing line, thereby losing the race in a defiant gesture aimed against their Ruxton Towers administrators. In deliberately losing the race, Smith demonstrates their free spirit and independence. The response of the borstal authorities to Smith's action is heavy-handed: Smith resigns themselves to the drudgery of manual labour they are returned to. However, looking back on their actions, they have no regrets.
Literary analysis [ edit ]
The "runner" as a metaphor [ edit ]
Long-distance running gives the character an ability to freely escape from society without the pressures of a team, which may be found in other athletic stories.[1] Additionally, Sillitoe gave running a political perspective that changed the vision of a literary runner. Sillitoe's character Smith uses running as a way to mentally reflect, allowing Smith to give clarity to their political insights and share them with the reader.[2] Through running, Smith begins to understand and become aware of the class divisions in Britain.[1][2]
During the time period that Sillitoe wrote "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner" the idea of the runner was changing dramatically. Helen Small states, “…the weight of literary attention seems to be focused on a ‘pre-professional era'—either written at that time or looking back at it for inspiration”.[2]
The 'angry young men' and Sillitoe [ edit ]
Author Alan Sillitoe is considered to be a member of the 'angry young men' movement by critics and colleagues (though Sillitoe themselves disliked this label). This term was associated with writers who created main characters that were "belligerent and opinionated", such as Smith. "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner" suggests a revolution to combat class issues of the time. Smith says “in the end the governor is going to be doomed while blokes like me will take the pickings of their roasted bones and dance like maniacs around their Borstal's ruins”.[3]
It is suggested that Sillitoe was never simply an “angry young man” but someone who would continue to be bitter despite youth, due to their deep hatred for the British class system. While it was suggested at the time that Sillitoe created a character to express extreme views, as time passed it has become clear that Sillitoe and Smith's views were not very different.[3][4]
References in culture [ edit ]
Music [ edit ]
Politics [ edit ]
On 9 January 2009, impeached Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich referred to the story: "Let me simply say, I feel like the old Alan Sillitoe short story 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner'... and that's what this is, by the way, a long-distance run."[5]
Literature [ edit ]
Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Inc., mentions in their book iWoz about how much they think like Smith and was influenced by Sillitoe's story.[citation needed]
HBO host Bill Maher and former Donald Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone shared a marijuana cake on “Real Time” on Friday night after finding common ground on marijuana policy.
“There's an issue we agree on — marijuana. You think [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsTrump says they haven't spoken to Barr about Mueller report Ex-Trump aide: Can't imagine Mueller not giving House a ‘roadmap' to impeachment Rosenstein: My time at DOJ is 'coming to an end' MORE is wrong ... to be such a hard-ass on marijuana," Maher said before asking, "Is that because you yourself are a Roger Stoner?”
“Only when I'm in the states where it's legal," Stone quipped. "Candidate Trump said we should let the states decide. They were absolutely right."

Maher was referring to a Friday op-ed Stone wrote for StoneColdTruth.com that urged President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE and Sessions to make marijuana an issue states decide on individually.
"Jeff Sessions states their position plainly: 'Good people don't smoke marijuana,' ” Stone wrote.
"This plainly false statement, made in all earnestness, clearly demonstrates how far from the mainstream Sessions is on this topic.”
Maher later noted that it was the 420th episode of "Real Time" and asked Stone to bring out what they referred to earlier as a "420 cake."
420 is often used as a code for marijuana users, and April 20 — 4/20 — is a day advocates recognize as a national holiday for cannabis culture.
“I need to get high. ... Roger, will you bring out the cake?” Maher asked.
Stone carried out a large white cake with a confectionery marijuana leaf as a decoration.
“We're going to share this after the show, Roger,” Maher said. “I know you say you're not a stoner … this cake is completely baked with pot. It is totally edible. Gentlemen, may I cut you a piece?”
The Fast-Food Restaurants That Require Few Human Workers
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Kannenberg/Flickr John Kannenberg/Flickr
In perhaps the largest nationwide fast-food strike in history, the employees who make your 99-cent burgers and tacos were planning strikes in 50 U.S. cities Thursday. Workers are calling for a $15 minimum wage and hoping to raise attention to the fast-food industry's low pay and limited prospects. The current federal minimum wage standard is $7.25 per hour.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Adam Jackson/Flickr Adam Jackson/Flickr
Business-friendly groups argue that the push for higher wages will only speed up the workers' "replacement by automation," especially if the demand for a higher minimum wage is met.
"The burgers of tomorrow could be made by robots — not employees," argues The Employment Policies Institute, a business-financed think tank that is running a full-page ad against the strike in The Wall Street Journal.
"The fight for $15 is a fight against technology, not management — and that's a fight that these union-organized protestors can't win. Instead of securing a bigger paycheck, the less-experienced employees demanding a more than 100 percent pay increase will find their jobs replaced by less-costly alternatives," Michael Saltsman, research director at EPI, said in a statement.
The chances of Congress raising the federal minimum wage are beyond slim, especially during a time when the only bills lawmakers can seem to pass involve renaming post offices. But the automation question got us thinking. Haven't we seen automated fast-food restaurants somewhere before?

Yes! They're called automats — restaurants where the food is served by vending machines.
Today, Amsterdam's Febo chain of stores feature only vending-machine service for burgers, fries and more. A few employees are responsible for stocking the items behind the machines but way out of customer view, so you can walk up, drop in your coins and get a hot meal after a long night out without talking to anyone face-to-face.
Japan also has a version of automats, known there as shokkenki. There, you choose the meal you want and purchase a ticket for it, then you hand in your ticket to the cook behind the counter. I guess this eliminates the role for the person who takes your order at the register.
And the serverless restaurant was actually in vogue in the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Smithsonian Magazine looked back:
"Horn & Hardart and its cavernous, waiterless establishments represented a combination of fast-food, vending and cafeteria-style eateries. These restaurants, with their chrome-and-glass coin-operated machines, brought high-tech, inexpensive eating to a low-tech era. Making their debut in Philadelphia in 1902, just up the street from Independence Hall, and reaching Manhattan in 1912, Horn & Hardart Automats became an American icon, celebrated in song and humor. With their uniform recipes and centralized commissary system of supplying their restaurants, the Automats were America's first major fast-food chain."
But by the 1970s, the magazine explains, automats fell victim to consumers' changing tastes and lifestyles. Americans had moved into the suburbs, which killed the late night business at downtown automats. And places like McDonald's had lower food costs.
Now that automation is en vogue again, maybe automats, like so many other trends, will get a chance at a comeback.
I'd overheard the tea-master talking to three Bhikkhuni (Buddhist nuns) about wild green tea. I asked if the Korean tea I usually buy is wild and they said that it was organic but not wild. I told them that I hadn't tried wild tea before, then. Soon, to my delight, they prepared a pot and took out a package of wild tea, hand made by a monk in the south-western region of Korea, steaming and roasting it nine times to attain its fullest potential (gu jung/gu po).
I thought it tasted very similar to a high quality Chinese green tea, just much softer. The tea master didn't agree when I asked if they thought it tasted similar, though!

Sandrine Uwase, a P.4 pupil at Ecole Primaire Karugira in Gikondo is happy their grades improved eversince they started playing chess.
The 2015/16 National Chess League winners, Eagles Chess Club (ECC), have urged parents and school administrators to embrace the sport.
This comes after two of the club's 14-year-old youngsters, Sandrine Uwase and Joselyne Uwase qualified to join the women's national team that will represent Rwanda at the 2016 Chess Olympiad in Baku, Azerbaijan from September 1.
Candidate Master (CM) Alexis Ruzigura, the ECC spokesperson, told Times Sport that parents must realize that introducing the game to their children is "an investment that pays off big time."
Ruzigura said: "Fortunately, Chess development doesn't need vast grounds and exorbitant funds. We are talking about a very important game, being the best sport to exercise the most important organ in our bodies, the brain,"
"The game improves kids' reading skills; increases problem-solving skills; and sparks creativity, and improves school grades, among others. It is bizarre we don't see the game in all homes and schools."
According to Ruzigura, a standard tournament chessboard costs about Rwf12, 000, " money which some parents spend on just beer yet chess is a big thing for a child."
They added that the cost of just one international soccer fixture in Kigali could sustain a three-year chess promotion campaign countrywide, with enormous and very rewarding results.
Superior performance
When qualifiers that determined which 10 players make both the Open and Women sections of the national team for the upcoming Olympiad, concluded last weekend, the Eagles had seven players in the national team.
The open and women sections of the national team have five players each and, in the entire national squad of 10 players, ECC has four players in the open section and three players, including two teenagers, in the women section.
The two girls who will be making their first appearance in the national team and in an Olympiad, Ruzigura said, are from a humble background but are now going to be ambassadors and role models.
The girls come from a densely populated slum in the Gikondo neighborhood of Kigali where chess is a thriving pastime.
"We hope they will inspire others to follow in their footsteps. And we hope that the exposure they get in Baku will propel them to greater heights," Ruzigura said.

Several towns, cities and counties around the nation are caving to President Trump's threat to pull funding, and abandoning their "sanctuary" pledges to shield illegal immigrants from federal authorities.
Dayton, Ohio, dropped a policy that restricted the city's cooperation with immigration officials pursuing illegal immigrants arrested for misdemeanors or felony property crimes, according to the Dayton Daily News. Police Chief Richard Biehl said federal authorities will no longer be impeded by the city when pursuing illegal immigrants being held by their department.
Other communities that have dropped policies of shielding illegal immigrant suspects from Immigration and Customs Enforcement include Miami-Dade and Dayton, are Saratoga, N.Y., Finney County, Kan., and Bedford, Penn., according to The Center for Immigration Studies, which keeps a list of sanctuary communities.
“We are reviewing policy changes at a multitude of other jurisdictions as well,” said Marguerite Telford, CIS's director of communications, who said the organization is “being inundated” by officials on its sanctuary map who want to be taken off.
The mayor of Miami-Dade County, which was considered a sanctuary community, made headlines recently when they changed a policy that called for refusing to hold arrested immigrants for immigration officials unless they committed to reimbursing the county for the cost of detention.
Telling reporters that they did not want to imperil hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding, Mayor Carlos Gimenez ordered jails to comply with federal immigration detention requests.
The changes have come on the heels of President Trump's executive order giving the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security the power to cut federal funding to communities that are deemed sanctuaries for illegal immigrants. Trump also has authorized the DHS to publish a weekly list of sanctuary communities.
CIS, and other groups that favor strict immigration enforcement, laud Trump's move.
“Are you really going to pick and choose what laws you're going to enforce?” asked Telford. “If you want a change [in immigration policy], go to the legislature.”
While some communities are rethinking their sanctuary policies under the pressure of losing funding, public officials of others, particularly major cities, have vowed to defy Trump's orders.
“We're going to defend all of our people regardless of where they come from, regardless of their immigration status,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York at a recent press conference.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel also vowed to protect illegal immigrants, including ones suspected or convicted of crimes, from the feds.
“I want to be clear: We're going to stay a sanctuary city," Emanuel said. "There is no stranger among us… you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American dream.”
The "sanctuary" term describes cities that employ a range of uncooperation with federal immigration authorities. Some refuse to hold suspects and even convicts who have completed their sentences for the feds to deport. Others refuse to furnish the feds with information on illegal immigrants who land on their radar through more benign activity.
Forbes contributor Adam Andrzejewski reported that more than 300 government jurisdictions claim to be sanctuaries, of which 106 are cities and “the rest are states, counties or other units of government.”
Supporters of sanctuary communities say that people who are here illegally but have not posed a danger to others or had trouble with police should not be turned over to immigration authorities.
Some police and town officials further argue that working with immigration officials will make people fearful of turning to them if they are the victim of a crime or have information about one.
“It's incredibly disappointing to see cities and counties scaling back so-called "sanctuary" policies, which were largely adopted to further public safety and ensure immigrants weren't afraid to call the police,” Grace Meng, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Fox News.
Ira Mehlman, spokesperson for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, predicted many more communities will be dropping or dramatically modifying their sanctuary stances.
“We're going to see more of this,” Mehlman told Fox News. “Faced with the possibility of losing federal dollars, they'll choose to keep funding public services rather than protecting illegal aliens.”
On Tuesday, Microsoft formally added Timeline and Sets to Windows 10 as part of a massive Windows 10 Insider build that reworks My People and Cortana with under-the-hood improvements such as more detailed display descriptions and Windows Update taskbar icons.
Windows Insider builds typically add a grab bag of features that Microsoft's development teams are separately introducing, but Build 17063 for the Fast Ring will have a ripple effect throughout Windows. Not only has Timeline been introduced, but Cortana will now encourage you to pick up where you left off and record your past activities.
Mentioned in this article Microsoft Windows 10 Home | Download $129.99 MSRP $119.99 See it on Amazon
Some users will also begin to see Sets, the new way of ordering what was previously multiple windows inside a new tabbed interface. Under the hood, Insiders will also begin to see more Fluent Shell additions throughout Windows, the name Microsoft has given for the UI improvements that include its new “acrylic” texturing. My People has also been tweaked, so that users can now drag and drop contacts, and rearrange them. And diving deeper, a new advanced display page will even list the “active” desktop resolution.
Why this matters: Insiders have waited for the big builds of Redstone 4 to begin arriving, and now they're here. If nothing else, it will give Windows 10 fans something to do during the holidays. And when will the rest of you get this? Most likely as part of the “Redstone 4” build, due sometime this spring.
Timeline's impact on Cortana, Task View and Sets
In late November, Microsoft unveiled Sets, a new way of organizing windows that goes hand-in-hand with the Timeline feature Microsoft originally planned for the Fall Creators Update. With Build 17063, those features have arrived.
Timeline basically reworks Task View, the little-used feature that allowed users to create “virtual desktops” of grouped applications. Now, Timeline—whose new icon will replace Task View on the taskbar, or can be opened by WIN + TAB—will keep track of what apps and pages you were using, and when. Scrolling back through Timeline and clicking on a file or webpage, naturally, will open it.
One of the goals of Timeline is to organize your tasks into activities, so that related apps and files are grouped together. Don't worry—Microsoft isn't watching you to see what apps or files you're using. Timeline will attempt to group items into an activity view based on criteria including what you've been using over the last hour. The activities are searchable, and organizable by account.
Microsoft Tmeline's searchable, too.
Cortana's now aware of those activities, too, and will more actively suggest which files and apps you were using on another device, including your phone. Separately, Cortana's Notebook has been reworked: Now called Organizer, it lists your reminders and to-do lists. (An earlier build added a Cortana capability called Collections, where Microsoft suggests potential interests. That's still there, but lists and Collections have also been combined, somewhat confusingly.)
Microsoft Do you want to exclude apps from Timeline? You can do that.
Microsoft's also pushing you to use Skills, additional third-party capabilities that other developers have added. Though Spotify controls aren't a skill, per se, Microsoft took the natural-language capabilities applied to Spotify in the Harman/Kardon Invoke and added them to Windows.
Microsoft Cortana now encourages you to pick up where you left off.
Finally, there are Sets, which Insiders may or may not see. (Some Insiders are being held out as a control group.) Sets won't group all apps together, but it will take Office (starting with Mail & Calendar and OneNote), Windows, and Edge and allow you to group them together in a tabbed interface.
Drag and drop My People
Windows 10's Fall Creators Update added My People, a proto-social network of sorts that allows you to pin your BFFs as icons on your taskbar. It wasn't perfect, though, and Microsoft has made some tweaks.
First, Microsoft's allowed some flexibility in the number of contacts that you can add: up to ten. Users can also rearrange those icons as they see fit—placing them on the taskbar in any order, or even banishing every one of them to what Microsoft calls the “overflow”—hidden behind the main My People icon. But if any of those overflow pals want to instant-message an emoji—one of My People's key features—they now can.

Snipping Tool ties in with Paint 3D
Snipping Tool, the easy way to grab a screenshot within Windows 10, now has an “edit in Paint 3D” feature. The idea is not only to allow content to be imported into Microsoft's 3D version of Paint, but also allow you to take advantage of the Paint 3D “Magic Select” feature and grab just part of the scene. (This all sounds rather awkward; why couldn't Magic Select just be included as part of the Snipping Tool?)
Microsoft Snipping Tool is a handy tool for tech journalists who partially make their living off of screenshots.
Windows Defender Application Guard arrives for Windows 10 Pro
If you've never heard of Windows Defender Application Guard, it's not really surprising; WDAG has been a feature of Windows 10 Enterprise, and one that's generally behind the scenes. Rest assured that you'll find it useful at home, though: Essentially, it uses Hyper-V to wall off your Edge browser even more securely from the rest of the operating system. If you browse any risky areas of the Internet, you'll want WDAG enabled.
Edge adds Fluent Design improvements
Microsoft Edge now looks better, too. Microsoft's new Fluent Desig UI elements have been added to Edge. Microsoft Edge has simplified adding and managing bookmarks for EPUB and PDF books, the company said. Edge also now supports offline push notifications for websites that support them.
Microsoft With Fluent Design, Edge now is all dressed up for the holidays.
Practical improvements for everyday use
For many, the significance of Windows 10's periodic upgrades aren't the creative features like Paint 3D, but the improvements for everyday use: OneDrive Files on Demand within the Fall Creators Update, for example. Build 17063 adds a number of these.
Security questions for local accounts. If your installation of Windows 10 is governed by a local account, who administers it? Well, you of course—and that's no help if you happen to forget that account's password. Now, you can add and update security questions to help you recover it.
Microsoft Local accounts now gain some additional security features.
Geeky display info. Some people care about the actual refresh rate of their display, rather than just what the monitor itself reports. Windows now supplies that information.
Microsoft Want to dive deep into your display? Windows can help.
Windows Update system tray icon. This sounds like an icon that will appear when an update is ready—something we all probably didn't know we desperately wanted until now. “In an effort to keep you informed about the state of your PC, if Windows Update Settings shows a warning or alert, we will now echo that via a new Windows Update system tray icon,” Microsoft says. “If you right-click the icon, you will see options relevant to the current state, such as restart, schedule the restart, or go to Windows Update settings. If visible, this icon can be turned off from within Taskbar Settings.”
Automatically fix scaling issues. Proper scaling of fonts is perpetually a problem for those who dock, change monitors, and take their devices on the go. Microsoft's new feature allows you to fix blurring or scaling problems by simply closing and re-launching the app, not by logging out. Windows can now keep an eye on things and try to ensure apps aren't blurry before they're launched. A notification may also warn you of blurred apps.
Microsoft If you've been plagued by blurred app fonts, Microsoft promises to help.
New keyboard settings. You'll be able to add new keyboard layouts easily, switch between Japanese 106/109 and English 101/102 keyboard layouts, turn on and off settings like key sounds and autocorrect, and customize other advanced keyboard-related settings, Microsoft promises. Remember, too, that your traditional PC keyboard can now trigger suggestions for the next word, just like your phone. That feature is now in Keyboard Settings > English (United States) > Options > Hardware keyboard > “Show text suggestions as I type.”
Microsoft Microsoft's new predictive keyboard, in action.
Cellular preferences for always-connected PCs. The truth of the matter is that some cellular connections are now faster than Wi-Fi, and unlimited, too. Windows now recognizes this, so that you can prioritize cellular connections versus Wi-Fi. But Microsoft is also revamping its Data Usage page so you can better keep track of how much data you've used, and meter it, too.
Microsoft This looks like a well-designed use of data to help Windows 10 users connect to the Internet.
Windows Subsystem for Linux can now run in the background. Processes that set themselves up to run in the background such as sshd, tmux/screen, etc. will now continue running after the last console window has been closed, Microsoft said.
There's one key bug
That's a massive amount of features, and Microsoft knows there will be issues. For gamers, there's a potential game-breaker, so be careful: Popular Tencent games like League of Legends and NBA2k Online may cause 64-bit PCs to “bugcheck,” locking up your PC with a green screen of death. So be careful!
James McGowan has visited McDonald's restaurants in 53 countries. James McGowan/McDonald's Around the World James McGowan has visited McDonald's restaurants in 53 countries and has written more than 340 reviews about the food he's tried on each trip.
As we reported previously, he's tried items like tuna pies in Thailand, "Sir Sombreros"— or fried cheese shaped like sombreros — in Serbia, chicken-sausage burgers in Malaysia, a crab-croquette burger in Okinawa, Japan, and sweet-potato fries in Singapore.
Of all the McDonald's locations he's tried, McGowan says Sri Lanka does it best.
McDonald's in Sri Lanka has a tiny, but very interesting menu with just a couple sandwiches, McGowan told Business Insider.
They said their favorite item on the menu is the seeni sambol sandwich, which features a folded egg and melted cheese on a hamburger bun topped with seeni sambol — a relish made with spicy onion and cured tuna. It costs about $2.15.
Here's the sandwich:
James McGowan/McDonald's Around the World The first bite of the sandwich is spicy, McGowan writes in a review of the seeni sambol sandwich on their blog, McDonald's Around the World..
"Immediately after the spice, you were hit with strong but very pleasant dried fish taste," McGowan writes. "The seeni sambol burger was also heavy on the red onions, which are traditionally cooked in coconut oil with garlic, sugar and tamarind. The onions were fried just enough where they were still crunchy, but not raw. The sugar gave the sauce a required stickiness, but not enough to make it sweet at all."
James McGowan/McDonald's Around the World McGowan said he's also a fan of McDonald's Sri Lanka's omelette burger, which features a vegetable-stuffed omelette inside a kids' meal hamburger bun.
James McGowan/McDonald's Around the World "Probably the best part about this burger in my opinion, was the complete lack of sauces," McGowan writes. "The simple blend of raw vegetables and egg was probably one of the freshest items I've ever had from any McDonald's, and it goes to show, that you don't have to have 16 toppings for a burger to be great."
McGowan has also tried a combo meal at the Sri Lanka location featuring a fish-and-rice dish with gravy and a veggie burger. They said the rice dish was delicious, but the veggie burger was bland.
James McGowan/McDonald's Around the World McGowan said the customers in McDonald's Sri Lanka appear to be mostly middle-to-upper-income families.
Here's a look at the inside of the restaurant and its limited menu.

I have the second round of test results from my experiment back. To quickly recap: I'm doing a test where I'm only eating Keto Chow and only drinking water. Nothing else. No snacks, no diet soda, no nothing. I am taking the Keto Chow fish oil pills as they are required to get the right EPA and DHA Ω3 fatty acids, and I was taking a magnesium malate supplement (I need more than normal) but I recently stopped that because the version of Keto Chow that I'm testing (v2.1rc2) has additional magnesium malate in it and the supplement I was taking had a gram of dextrose in it (which sucks). Here's my complete food log and information from Cron-o-meter for the experiment so far, and here are my blood tests, updated with the results of my last blood test.
Insulin is up a bit though still quite low, my cholesterol is much the same as before other than my LDL-P count continues to drop. At this rate, it'll be under 1000 around the time the experiment ends. CRP is higher but still in a good range. Still not dead from living on fat.
As discussed in my initial post about doing this experiment, I don't have refrigeration available so I've been coming up with ways to adapt. Primarily I've been using avocado oil. I'll be posting more about this when I'm actually back from the trip, but I'll say right now that I absolutely prefer heavy cream. Avocado oil isn't bad, and if I hadn't ever tried Keto Chow with heavy cream I'd probably think it's super awesome. For people with dairy or digestive issues, or people wanting something shelf stable it's an amazing option that works very well. Avocado oil also has 0 carbs, which means my net carb totals for the days I ate only keto chow with avocado oil are a CRAZY low 1.4g – for the ENTIRE DAY. That's insane, as is the 5.3 mmol/L of blood ketones I'm currently registering, I actually hit 5.5 a few days ago. Weird that the only ongoing biometric I have right now is blood ketones since I don't have a scale or anything else. It's going to be interesting Friday morning after I get home to see what happened to my weight this week =)
While campaigning on their brand of populism this year, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly promised to "Make America Great Again" with protectionist trade policies that would bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs to America.
Now weeks into their transition, Trump is keeping up that fiery message — even as their Republican allies on the Hill prepare to vote against specific "Buy America" legislation meant to help American workers.

At one of their victory rallies last week in Cincinnati, Trump told the crowd, “We will have two simple rules when it comes to this massive rebuilding effort: Buy American and hire American. Whether it is producing steel, building cars or curing disease, we want the next generation of innovation and production to happen right here in America and right here in Ohio, right?”
But Republicans in Congress, apparently ready to buck their party's leader, days later announced that they were removing the "buy America" amendment from a water infrastructure bill that would require the government to only fund projects that use American-made steel. The provision would have allowed for exceptions if American steel had quality or supply problems or drove up costs substantially.
Ignoring Trump's demand that the government find ways to support U.S. manufacturers, particularly the steel industry, House Republicans stripped a "buy America" provision from their version of the Water Resources Development Act that had already passed the Senate. The bill is for infrastructure spending on the country's waterways.
Language in the Senate-passed version of the Water Resources Development Act required the use of American iron and steel products in projects using billions of dollars in federal funding from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund — a provision that would have been a major boon for steelmakers who have hemorrhaged production to China and Turkey.
Republicans in the House, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, let the bill's final language to include a "buy America" provision only for 2017. Such a one-year requirement would have been assured anyway (as it was already approved last year) and Democrats had wanted a permanent "Buy America" provision.
Ohio's Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown was quick to slam House Republicans opposition to the ostensibly Trump-backed provision.

“By stripping meaningful Buy America rules from the water infrastructure bill, Washington leadership is choosing China and Russia over Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,” said Brown. “This was the first major test of whether Washington establishment Republicans would live up to President-elect Trump's promises to put American products and American workers first — they failed, and American iron and steelworkers will pay the price.”
Wisconsin's Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin made the divide between Trump and House Republicans on the issue clearer, as they vowed to reintroduce "Buy America" legislation.
“He really needs to stick to that promise and take a stand right now,” Baldwin said in a press release about Trump, who hasn't spoken out on this specific bill.
“By removing my Buy America standard, Speaker Ryan and House Republicans embraced the status-quo in Washington," they declared in another press release. "Our American manufacturers and workers deserve a solid commitment from us and I'm not giving up this fight to build a made in America infrastructure. The choice for the Republican establishment in Washington is clear: Do you stand with American workers or do you support spending taxpayer dollars on Chinese and Russian steel for American water infrastructure projects?”

Democrats are calling on Republicans to reinstate the provision before the House and Senate versions of the legislation are reconciled.
Today we bring you the next episode of the Steal This Show podcast, discussing the latest file-sharing and copyright trends and news. In this episode we interview Tamas Kocsis, founder and developer of the potentially revolutionary P2P platform Zeronet.
In this first episode of our new season, we interview Tamas Kocsis, the founder and developer Zeronet.
Zeronet is a relatively new project that gives us the ability to develop completely distributed websites, invulnerable to censorship of any kind.
With Tor anonymity baked in, at least on the Windows version, that creates a very powerful environment for free expression.
Today Zeronet founder Tamas talks us through the history of the platform and some of the features he's working on at the moment.
In addition they discuss plans to add a BitTorrent plugin that may be able to provide distributed, anonymous video streaming – which sounds like a new headache for Hollywood just around the corner.
But, Zeronet isn't just a about torrents: we also hear from Tamas how it can be used right now to set up anonymous messaging, forums, marketplaces, and more.

Video: Body transfer illusion Video: Body transfer illusion
Last time you checked you were a conservatively dressed, 28-year-old man. But you look down and notice that you now have the legs of a 10-year-old girl and appear to be wearing a skirt.
It turns out that this experience – facilitated by a virtual-reality headset and some brief arm-stroking – is enough to make men in their mid-20s react as if this new body is their own. They feel that way even when they subsequently move outside the girl's perspective and watch them being attacked.
“This is the first experiment to show that body ownership can be transferred to an entirely virtual body,” says Mel Slater of the University of Barcelona, Spain, who led the team that carried out the experiment.
The finding highlights how far our sense of self and body image can be manipulated, and could lead to therapies for conditions of body-image distortion such as anorexia.

Rubber hands
Over 10 years ago, body-transfer illusions were first demonstrated using a false hand. In the so-called rubber hand illusion, researchers found that if they put a rubber hand on a table in front of a person, and then stroked the rubber hand and the person's own hand at the same time and in the same way, they could convince the volunteer that the rubber hand was their own.
More recently, the illusion was replicated using full-body manikins: volunteers' skin conducted more electricity when their manikin double was attacked with a knife, indicating fear.
To see if the virtual world could be used to induce a similar illusion, Slater's team gave 24 men a head-tracking video display to wear and recorded their heart rates. When the volunteers looked down, in place of their own body they saw that of a 10-year-old girl in a tartan skirt. They also saw a virtual woman approaching them and stroking their virtual girl's arm, while in the real world unseen experimenters touched the men's flesh-and-blood arm.
After this preparation, the virtual visual angle of the men's headsets changed, and the volunteers found themselves looking down on their avatars. They now saw the girl being slapped by the virtual woman. Immediately afterwards, the men were asked to rate how strongly they felt that the girl's body was theirs.
Pounding heart
On average, the men reported medium-strength feelings about the girl's body being their own, and strong feelings that the woman was touching their body.
Stranger still, as the girl was slapped, the men's heart rate changed in ways that were similar to, although not as great as, those recorded when people feel threatened. Slater emphasises that this was surprising, given that the men were looking down on the girl, from a third-person perspective, by this point.
These changes in heart rate did not occur when the same men did a second experiment that was identical, except they viewed the whole scene from the third-person point of view.
The experiment demonstrates the strong connection the volunteers felt to their new, virtual bodies, says Slater. They suggest that the familiarity of looking down and seeing our own body “is so overwhelming” that even dramatic changes in body won't override the influence of vision.
Malleable self
The findings might be applied to entertainment – to make video games more immersive, for example – but also to psychology. People considering a sex change have used the virtual world of Second Life to test what it is like to have a different gender.
Meanwhile, previous studies found that giving people virtual-reality avatars that are taller or shorter than they are alters the way they behave. Making ourselves fatter or slimmer could also have “profound implications” on our psychology and behaviour, says Slater, which could be used to develop therapies for people with body-image problems.
Alexander Mussap of Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, who has studied the rubber hand illusion in the context of eating disorders, says the new research further demonstrates that “our sense of self is surprisingly malleable”.
Social neuroscientist Liane Young at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says that knowing that people transfer themselves into avatars could be used to answer many questions in psychology.

A Georgia state lawmaker with an unconventional grasp of the First Amendment is backing a bill that would make lewd photoshopping a crime punishable by a $1,000 fine.
Rep. Earnest Smith pointed, as proof of the problem, to a picture of their head that was recently edited onto a pornstar's body. That image was created by a blogger who used the image to mock Smith.
The Augusta-based legislator said they were not worried the bill would step on First Amendment rights.
“Everyone has a right to privacy,” they told FoxNews.com. “No one has a right to make fun of anyone. It's not a First Amendment right.”
The lawmaker did not provide any specifics of the legislation when contacted by FoxNews.com. After being pressed to provide details, they said, “At this juncture, I am not at liberty to share anything with you. I don't have to. If and when this bill passes we can revisit the issue and if I choose to give you details at that time I will, but until then I don't have to tell you anything.”
More On This...
Smith first introduced their proposal a year ago. According to the bill's summary, it would make it a misdemeanor offense to alter a photograph that “causes an unknowing person wrongfully to be identified as the person in an obscene depiction.” Smith introduced the legislation last year after a teenage girl was subjected to “online attacks.”
[pullquote]
However, after a picture of their head photoshopped on the body of a naked man stretched out on some rocks started circling the Internet, Smith renewed their efforts.
When asked if they thought their bill would target parodies -- which are protected by the First Amendment -- they said it didn't matter.
“They (parody creators) live for something like this,” Smith said. “They are vulgar. This is about being vulgar. We're becoming a nation of vulgar people.”
Not everyone shares Smith's sentiments.
“He's the conductor of their own crazy train,” one lawmaker told FoxNews.com.
Georgia Politics Unfiltered blogger Andre Walker said he's behind the photoshopped pictures of Smith.
“I did exactly what Rep. Smith wants to make illegal,” Walker, who has referred to Smith's bill as “asinine,” wrote on their blog. “I pasted a picture of Smith's head onto the body of a male porn star.”
“The first Amendment to the Constitution of the United States protects all forms of speech, not just spoken word,” Walker said. “It attempts to regulate speech and I doubt it would stand up in a court of law.”
The blogger added, “I cannot believe Rep. Earnest Smith thinks I'm insulting them by putting their head on the body of a well-built porn star.”
We look in detail about Angler Exploit pack's fileless infection. Thanks to friends at malware-traffic-analysis.net who provided captures of two different instances of Angler exploit pack delivery. You can download the samples and captures from these links Link1, Link2. There is one technical blog about this infection chain. I am going to add in some more information about this particular instance.
The original malware delivery chain looks like this:
The binary file is downloaded immediately after the first URL visit. No other payloads are downloaded in between. So it is clearly an IE exploit.
The initial exploit payload is obfuscated using a string replacement technique.
After De-obfuscating this, we can see the original logic applied to deliver the exploit.
It looks for various AV vendor's Windows driver filename to see whether any AV running in the victim machine. We see this check regularly in Exploit packs in recent days. It looks for vulnerable Flash, Silverlight, JRE and IE. If it finds a vulnerable IE then it will execute the CVE-2013-2551 Exploit. The IE vulnerability is found by Vupen. You can read more about this in Vupen blog and in my previous blog. The exploit is obfuscated to some level. After de-obfuscating and renaming, it looks like this.
The Javascript code has a “string obfuscator” to encode few variables in the shellcode part. The parameter passed to the exploitme() function is the final shellcode executed after setting up the “environment” once triggering the vulnerability. The “Javascript escaped” strings stored in ‘shellcodeFirstPart' , ‘shellcodeSecondPart', ‘shellcodeThirdPart', ‘shellcodeFourthPart' are encoded using the simple logic shown below.
The shellcode that includes executing the initial ROP and setting up the stack and register and final shellcode is constructed in retShellcodeStartAddress() function. retShellcodeStartAddress() constructs the full shellcode and return the address to the caller.
retShellcodeStartAddress() uses returnShellcode() to build the second stage shellcode. That includes saving all the registers and calling a “decoder” that decodes the third stage shellcode (‘shellcodeFirstPart' , ‘shellcodeSecondPart', ‘shellcodeThirdPart', ‘shellcodeFourthPart').
The variable ‘DAC5cw' is the original decoder that decodes the third stage shellcode. Check the comparison below.
Once the control reaches third stage shellcode, it finds the kernel32.dll base and it starts resolving few API's by parsing PE format.
It resolves these functions:
WinExec
LoadLibraryA
GetProcAddress
GetTempPathA
VirtualAlloc
VirtualFree
CreateFileA
WriteFile
CloseHandle
CreateThread
WaitForSingleObject
InternetOpenA
InternetReadFile
InternetCloseHandle
Once resolving these functions, it will download the binary file from the target URL and save that in-memory. The download binary is in encoded form.
The third stage shellcode decodes the download binary using a static key “adR2b4nh”.
All the decision on whether to save and execute the downloaded binary or execute in-memory is all depends on the first two bytes of the download binary. If the first two bytes of the payload is “MZ” then it will write it into disk and registers the file using regsvr and continue execution. Otherwise if the first two bytes is 0x9090 then it will continue executing that buffer.
The binary blog following 0x9090 is actually a shellcode that does the loading of this DLL in-memory using “Reflective-DLL” loading technique. It starts resolving kernel32.dll and other exported API's using API hashing technique.
Once it finishes resolving DLL's and API's, it will start doing the operations related to the “Reflective DLL” loading technique. The steps it takes to load the DLL is very similar to the code shown here. I see one small difference in this malware sample. In the original code, it used PE parsing technique to relocate the DLL but this sample using windows undocumented API's RtlImageDirectoryEntryToData() and LdrProcessRelocationBlock() to do that.
The loaded DLL has many export functions:
ATrailingAllTo()
DefiningSFirstIs()
FileBoth()
IsInformationPreservedSyntax()
IsLineValueMust()
MatterTrailingLeast()
SameAreWhich()
StartingASyntax()
ThereTruthAPair()
ValueLinesThe()
The in-memory payload is a nightmare for detection technologies that depends mostly on the file system activities.

Let us turn away for a moment from the great show going on in Washington and look for a moment at a show taking place in Newark.
That's the Bob Menendez show.
Our senior senator is about to go on trial on corruption charges in a case that has a little bit of everything that makes life in this democracy so fascinating: parties in the tropics, a mysterious and beautiful Russian woman named Svitlana, and a big dose of Palm Beach high life.
That life was led by Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor who is truly larger than life.
Unfortunately, the bills they submitted to Medicare were also larger than life. In April, they were convicted by a jury in Palm Beach on 67 counts stemming from their practice of billing Medicare for as much as $20 million a year for some highly questionable treatments.
The 67-year-old Melgen is due to be sentenced on Aug. 11 to a prison term that might amount to a life sentence. They could get even more time if he's found guilty in the Sept. 6 trial in Newark, in which they are a co-defendant with the senator.
In that case, Menendez faces a 10-count indictment accusing them of taking flights on the doctor's private jet and on commercial and chartered jets as well as a free hotel room in Paris and other goodies -- allegedly in return for doing various favors for the doctor
Will the doctor turn on the senator to bargain for a light sentence?
We should know that in the next two weeks. If they do it, will be bad news for the former Union City mayor who rode the Hudson County machine all the way to the U.S. Senate.
But Menendez got some good news recently from the other side of the Hudson River. That came in a case involving Sheldon Silver, the former New York Assembly Speaker who represented a district in Lower Manhattan.
In 2015, Silver was convicted on charges that they gave favors to constituents who steered business to their law firm. But on July 13, a federal Appellate Court in Manhattan reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial.
The grounds were somewhat technical. But on that technicality may ride the senator's chances of remaining a free man.
In the 2-1 decision, the judges ruled that the judge in Silver's trial had employed an overbroad definition of the term "official act" in charging the jury.
The jurors were told they could convict Silver if they found they had performed "any action taken under color of official authority" for their benefactors.
But shortly after Silver was convicted, the Supreme Court issued a ruling reversing the conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell in a similar case.
McDonnell had gotten various goodies from a supporter. But the high court ruled that they could not be convicted of corruption unless they had engaged in "the formal exercise of government power" in return for the gifts.
Just setting up meetings and making phone calls doesn't count. There has to be some official action by the defendant.
Menendez is being represented by Abbe Lowell, one of the nation's top defense attorneys - who's also representing Jared Kushner in that D.C. drama.
Lowell lost no time in filing a motion to have the charges against Menendez thrown out on the grounds that the favors they allegedly performed for the doctor did not rise to the level of "official acts."
Those favors included intervening with the federal bureaucracy on Melgen's behalf in the Medicare case as well as in Melgen's efforts to get a lucrative port-security contract in the Dominican Republic.
The senator is also accused of helping Melgen get visas to import various girlfriends, including the asupervisorstioned Svitlana Buchyk.
But do those actions meet the Supreme Court's definition of "official acts?"
A lot is riding on the answer, including what could be a deciding vote on many issues that come before the Senate.
The Republicans would like nothing more than to add a seat to their shaky 52-48 majority. If Menendez is convicted and has to resign immediately, then Gov. Christie will have the opportunity to fill the seat until November of 2018, presumably with a Republican - even himself.
But if the senator could hold onto their seat until mid-January, the appointment would be up to the next governor. Polls say that's likely to be Democrat Phil Murphy.
Even if Menendez is convicted, it takes a two-thirds vote of the Senate to expel a member. That means 25 or so Democrats would have to support the expulsion.
Would they do so if a fellow Democrat filed an appeal on the same grounds Silver did?
All of that hinges on what happens at the trial.
It promises to be the best show this side of the Beltway.
PLUS: The insightful Phil Kerpen has a great column about how the endgame could play out if Menendez is convicted.
It takes a two-third vote of the Senate to remove a member convicted on a felony. Will the Dems find a way to delay until a Democratic governor takes office?
Here's Phil's take:
If Menendez is convicted but refuses to resign, the Senate Ethics Committee should act as quickly as possible to recommend expulsion, and if necessary the full Senate should vote on expulsion.
That course of action would be appropriate according to the standard set by the Democratic Senate Caucus itself as recently as 2008, when it issued a press release with the headline: "A Convicted Felon Is Not Going to Be Able to Serve in the United States Senate."
"And as precedent shows us," Democratic Leader Harry Reid said, a convicted felon senator "will face an ethics committee investigation and expulsion, regardless of their appeals process."
"This is not a partisan issue," Reid added.
They were talking about Ted Stevens, a Republican, and to the credit of Republicans they strongly agreed they should resign or be expelled.
But will Democrats change their tune if the felon senator is one of theirs?It's hard to doubt that they will.

Lentils braised in red wine are delicious whether you're a kid or an adult.
Photo by James Ransom
This post originally appeared on Food52.
In our pantry, the lentils live in a glass case that reads: Break in case of dinner.
Lentils can never be praised enough: Come home, put water on to boil, find the lentils—you can be eating a half-hour after you walk in. Add sautéed onions and carrots, wedges of feta, fried eggs: You have what passes for a real dinner in less time than it takes to order it. Here's what I do: Get home, call for take-out, make lentils, and then, when the delivery guy arrives, feed them the lentils.
Lentils are humble and tireless. But even Cinderella wanted to go to the damn ball sometime. Hence: lentils braised in red wine.
This comes from the Zuni Café Cookbook, which also can never be praised too much, and Judy Rodgers, who wrote about cooking as thoughtfully as anyone before or since. (And who is deeply missed.) Even devoted Zuni Cookbook readers may have skipped this recipe, though, because in it Rodgers uses a phrase that will crush the spirit of any must-get-dinner-on-the-table parent: as you would risotto.
She's referring to their “stingy-with-the-liquid method”—these lentils get a large splash of liquid at first, then smaller splashes, added as each is absorbed. It's a technique that might scare off any sane parent. It should not. This recipe is admittedly more work than a no-thought lentil dinner. But not much. Unlike risotto—where you add preciously little liquid each time, stir, stir again, wait for it to cook off almost entirely, then scrape the pan, then add more liquid—these lentils require far less attention and tolerate far greater error. You just add a little liquid whenever you notice it. And you stir occasionally. You're in the kitchen most of the time anyway, after all.
What you get for it is a perfectly nutty texture and a subtle, winey taste—the rare sophisticated lentil dish.
On alcohol: Yes, there's wine here—a cup—which simmers for about a half-hour. A disclaimer: The alcohol will not all cook off. Over half of it will, in all likelihood, but some percentage will not. As a parent, I found this troubling. So as an experiment, I made the dish twice: once with the wine and once without, and after each I had both children undergo a functional MRI, while taking the SAT, to see if their neuronal activity was differentially affected.
Kidding! (They took the ACT.) Look. It's really a very small amount of alcohol. But you should know that there's an amount.
Photo by James Ransom
On framing: If your children frown at the word lentils, I recommend stones. As in, We're having stones for dinner tonight! Or, How many of your rocks have you eaten? This also segues nicely into a discussion of how gizzards work, which can only increase the amount of stones eaten.
Other columns give you wine recommendations. But only this column gives you ridiculous conversation prompts.

Swimming and Wading
Because flamingos have long legs, they can wade into much deeper water than most other birds. Webbed feet support them on soft mud.
When the water is beyond their wading depth, flamingos swim at the surface while feeding. Webbed feet allow the flamingo to swim quite readily.
There is no evidence that flamingos dive.
Flamingos are often seen in dense packs floating on the surface of the water.
Respiration
Like other birds, flamingos breathe air with lungs. They hold their breath while feeding underwater.
Sleep
When flamingos are resting, they may sit down with their legs tucked beneath them or rest standing on one leg.
While resting, flamingos face into the wind. This stops wind and rain from penetrating their feathers. When resting on one leg, flamingos can be seen swaying back and forth in the wind.
Thermoregulation
Flamingos frequently stand on one leg. Curling a leg under the body keeps the foot warm and conserves body heat. Flamingos stand on one leg in both cool and warm environments.
Flight
To take off, a flamingo runs several steps, begins flapping its wings, and lifts off into the air. When landing the procedure is reversed: the bird touches down and then runs several paces.
A flamingo flies with its head and neck stretched out in front and its legs trailing behind.
Flight speed of a flock of flamingos can reach 50 to 60 kph (31-37 mph).
Flamingos have been known to fly 500 to 600 km (311-373 mi.) each night between habitats.
Adaptations for a High Salinity Environment
The majority of lakes where flamingos live have extremely high salt concentrations. The only source of fresh water for some of these birds comes from boiling geysers. Flamingos are capable of drinking water at temperatures that approach the boiling point.
Flamingos excrete salt through salt glands in the nostrils.
Can cassette tapes make a comeback?
JOHANNESBURG - American rap star Eminem has made a new release of their "The Slim Shady LP" in the form of a cassette.
According to an online television report, an autographed collection of the tapes, which includes a bundle with a T-shirt and a 3-D motion print cover has already sold out.
They announced the re-release in a tweet last week, sparking a fairly sceptical response from fans.
@Eminem man wtf is this, my cassette player is long gone.

@Eminem I love this idea. Take us back to the old school way. I still got my cassette player 😊 — IAm Woman Of Worth☔️ (@Uniquely_sweet_) March 5, 2016
In South Africa, online classifieds like OLX and Gumtree are somewhat proof of a continued demand for cassette tapes and other related devices.
Gumtree's Estelle Nagel says "We are seeing them slowly coming back into vogue, with more and more searches popping up for cassette players as users get nostalgic over their "mix tape from the 80s". This bodes well because a few years ago, vinyl LPs were selling for a few rands each (if at all) but today they are considered an extremely hot commodity and sell out very fast at high prices on Gumtree."
They say it's mostly popular with adults with nostalgia.
"It's a pattern that keeps repeating itself. Individuals who are up and coming and earning well get nostalgic over the things they enjoyed as children or teenagers (whether it was their early 90s boombox or 80s troll dolls). They now have the means to purchase these items at inflated prices. My advice would be to hold on to your old tape deck players and VCRs…you never know when the boom will happen."
Will you be purchasing Eminem's new release?
WATCH: Hedy Bohm, a Toronto woman who survived Auschwitz, tells their story and why it is important to remember. Sean Mallen reports.
TORONTO – On a cold January day in 1945, nine-year-old Miriam Friedman Ziegler watched as Red Army soldiers approached Auschwitz. An army photographer captured the historic moment: 13 wide-eyed children – Friedman Ziegler among them -staring out through a barbed-wire fence.
The thought of freedom was a scary notion for the Jewish girl who'd spent a year in Auschwitz separated from the rest of their family.
“What's going to happen to me now?” they recall thinking at the time. “I have nobody.”

They would later reunite with their mother, but their father never made it out of the infamous Nazi camp alive.
Auschwitz has become a symbol of the horrors of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were systematically killed.
WATCH: An extended interview with Hedy Bohm.
Friedman Ziegler, who lives in Thornhill, Ont., is among about 100 survivors who are returning to Poland this week to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.
Going back is not easy for the 79-year-old.
“I swore I would never go back to Poland, but I feel it's my duty now to do it,” Friedman Ziegler said during a recent interview with The Canadian Press.
On Monday, they will reunite for the first time with four of the girls – now women in their 70s and 80s – featured in the iconic photo. A new photo will capture the moment. This time, however, it will be in the comfort of a hotel in Krakow – the emotions of having the photo taken at the nearby camp too overwhelming.

Leafing through photographs at their apartment north of Toronto, Friedman Ziegler kept returning to the black-and-white photo, where they look bewildered, their left sleeve pulled up revealing their prisoner identification number – A16891 – that the Nazis tattooed on their skin.
“How come I am the only one showing my number? I don't know what made me do it,” they said, adding that at their age, one army looked like any other.
READ MORE: Second World War concentration camp survivor tells their story
Friedman Ziegler's journey began in 1940 in Radom, Poland, where their father ran a couple of stores. Life was idyllic, they said, until one day the Nazi tanks rolled into town. Them mother took off with Friedman Ziegler toward their grandparents' house in a nearby town via horse and buggy. But the man driving the buggy tossed them en route, fearing for their life.
They hid in the forest during the day and walked at night, eventually reaching their grandparents' home. The Nazis had not arrived, but they were coming. So Friedman Ziegler's grandfather paid a sympathetic farmer to hide them The farmer would take them to town to beg for food and money, introducing them as their niece. They fit in because they looked like many other Polish girls with long, blond hair.
On their walks along the countryside, they say they saw death. Dogs tearing at bodies, a family hanged outside their house. Shortly after they reunited with their family – a pattern that continued for years, sometimes hiding with strangers, sometimes hiding with their family.
Every now and then the Nazis would pin them down for a “selection” – in which they picked out people to take them away or kill them on the spot. During one of those “selections,” they watched their family line up outside along with their aunt Bella, who was holding their newborn baby in their arms.
“I could see what they were doing and I saw them shooting the baby,” said a teary Friedman Ziegler, their voice breaking with emotion.
When they turned eight, the Nazis loaded them and their parents in cattle cars and shipped them to Auschwitz.
The children were taken to the adjacent Birkenau death camp, where Friedman Ziegler found a few of their cousins and met many other girls who would later become lifelong friends.
The Nazi “selections” continued inside the camp, they said, but they became more sinister.
“Everytime they took out a few of the children for experiments some came back, some didn't,” they recalled.
“All I remember is going to this big room with people in white uniforms and lots of tables with things on them,” they said. Later they couldn't remember anything.
“I came back and had pain in my hips and legs and that's all I know.”
Then one day the Nazis abandoned the camp temporarily and the children, including Friedman Ziegler, snuck off to Auschwitz where they raided the barracks for food and clothing and then returned to camp.
When the Nazis returned they asked anyone who wanted to walk to freedom to line up. They shot everyone in line.
Auschwitz was liberated on Jan. 27, 1945.
Alexander Vorontsov, a Red Army combat photographer, filmed the camp shortly after liberation, according to Anne Marie Stein of the USC Shoah Foundation. The photograph Friedman Ziegler appears in is actually a still image from the film, part of which was shown at the Nuremberg trials.
After Auschwitz, Friedman Ziegler spent time in various hospitals and orphanages in eastern Europe. Eventually, they came to Canada as part of a group of 1,000 child refugees. They lived for a while in Hamilton with relatives – memories of death and suffering still fresh in their mind.
One time, when they were told they were going to summer camp, Friedman Ziegler said they broke down in tears.
“I said ‘I'm going to another camp?”‘ they recalled. “Then they explained to me ‘No no, this is a nice camp. You're going to ride horses, learn English, you're going to have the best time in your life', which was true.”
Two years later their mother came to Canada and the pair settled in Toronto. They eventually met their husband – also a Holocaust survivor – on a blind date. The couple has three children.
“I had a very, very good life,” they said. “I never dreamt that I would live in such a beautiful place.”
They have rarely spoken about what happened during the Holocaust, even with their family.
“I'm hearing some of these horrible stories for the first time,” said their daughter, Adrienne Shulman, who is accompanying their mother to Poland.
The interviews and media attention has worn Friedman Ziegler down. She's emotional and ready to move on, but believes it is their duty to talk.
“I was lucky enough to live,” they said. “I want the world to know.”
Joel Berger is on the hunt. Crouching on a snow-covered hillside, the conservation biologist sports a full-length cape of brown faux fur and what looks to be an oversized teddy bear head perched on a stake. Holding the head aloft in one hand, they begin creeping over the hill's crest toward their target: a herd of huddling musk oxen.
It's all part of a plan that Berger, who is the wildlife conservation chair at Colorado State University, has devised to help protect the enigmatic animal that roams the Alaskan wilderness. They slowly approach the unsuspecting herd and makes note of how the musk oxen react. At what distance do they look their way? Do they run away, or stand their ground and face him? Do they charge? Each of their reactions will give them vital clues to the behavior of what has been a notoriously elusive study subject.
Weighing up to 800 pounds, the Arctic musk ox resembles a smaller, woollier cousin of the iconic American bison. But their name is a misnomer; the creatures are more closely related to sheep and goats than oxen. These quadrupeds are perfectly adapted to the remote Arctic wasteland, sporting a coat of thick fur that contains an insulating under layer to seal them away from harsh temperatures.
Perhaps most astonishing is how ancient these beasts are, having stomped across the tundra for a quarter of a million years relatively unchanged. "They roamed North America when there were giant lions, when there were woolly mammoths," Berger told NPR's Science Friday earlier this year, awe evident in their voice. "And they're the ones that have hung on." They travel in herds of 10 or more, scrounging the barren landscape in search of lichen, grasses, roots and moss.
But despite their adaptations and resilience, musk oxen face many modern threats, among them human hunting, getting eaten by predators like grizzlies and wolves, and the steady effects of climate change. Extreme weather events—dumps of snow, freezing rain or high temperatures that create snowy slush—are especially tough on musk oxen. “With their short legs and squat bodies," they can't easily bound away like a caribou, explains Jim Lawler, an ecologist with the National Parks Service.
In the 19th century, over-hunting these beasts for their hides and meat led to a statewide musk ox extinction—deemed "one of the tragedies of our generation" in a 1923 New York Times article. At the time, just 100 musk oxen remained in North America, trudging across the Canadian Arctic. In 1930, the U.S. government shipped 34 animals from Greenland to Alaska's Nunivak Island, hoping to save a dwindling species.
It worked: by 2000, roughly 4,000 of the charismatic beasts roamed the Alaskan tundra. Yet in recent years that growth has slowed, and some populations have even started to decline.
Which brings us back to how little we know about musk oxen. Thanks to their tendency to live in sparse groupings in remote regions that are near-impossible for humans or vehicles to traverse, no one knows the reason for today's mysterious decline. The first part of untangling the mystery is to figure out basic musk ox behavior, including how they respond to predators.
This is why Berger is out in the Arctic cold, dressed up as a musk ox's worst nightmare.
Becoming the other
Donning a head-to-toe grizzly bear costume to stalk musk oxen wasn't Berger's initial plan. He'd been working with these animals in the field since 2008, studying how climate change was impacting the herds. Along with the National Parks Service, they spent several years tracking the herds with radio collars and watching from a distance how they fared in several regions of Western Alaska.
During this work, scientists began to notice that many herds lacked males. This was likely due to hunting, they surmised. In addition to recreational trophy hunting, musk oxen are important to Alaskan subsistence hunters, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game grants a limited number of permits each year for taking a male musk ox. This is a common wildlife management strategy, explains Lawler: "You protect the females because they're your breeding stock."
But as the male populations declined, park officials began finding that female musk ox and their babies were also dying.
In 2013, a study published in PlosOne by members of the National Park Service and Alaska's Department of Fish and Game suggested that gender could be playing a key role. In other animals like baboons and zebras, males hold an important part in deterring predators, either by making alarm calls or staying behind to fight. But no one knew whether musk ox had similar gender roles, and the study quickly came under criticism for a lack of direct evidence supporting the link, says Lawler.
That's when Berger had their idea. They recall having a conversation with their park service colleagues about how difficult these interactions would be to study. “Are there ways we can get into the mind of a musk ox?'” they thought. And then it hit him: They could become a grizzly bear. "Joel took that kernel of an idea and ran with it," says Lawler.
This wouldn't be the first time Berger had walked in another creature's skin in the name of science. Two decades earlier, they were investigating how carnivore reintroduction programs for predators, such as wolves and grizzlies, were affecting the flight behavior of the moose. In this case, they dressed up as the prey, donning the costume of a moose. Then, they covertly plunked down samples of urine and feces from predators to see if the real moose reacted to the scent.
It turns out that the creatures learned from past experiences: Mothers who had lost young to predators immediately took notice, while those who lost calves to other causes remained “blissfully ignorant” of the danger, they say.
To be a grizzly, Berger would need an inexpensive and extremely durable design that could withstand being bounced around "across permafrost, across rocks, across ice, up and over mountains and through canyons," they explain. The most realistic Hollywood costumes cost thousands of dollars, they say, and they couldn't find anyone willing to "lend one on behalf of science."
So Berger, who is also a senior scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society, turned to the WCS' Bronx Zoo to borrow a their teddy-bear-like ensemble. They then recruited a graduate student to make a caribou garment, so they could test how the musk oxen would react to a faux predator versus an unthreatening fellow ungulate.
After comparing the two disguises in the field, they found that the bear deception worked. When dressed as a caribou, he's largely ignored. But when they  their grizzly suit, the “musk oxen certainly become more nervous,” they say. Now it was time to start gathering data.
The trouble with drones
Playing animal dress-up is far from a popular method for studying elusive creatures. More common strategies include footprint tracking and GPS collars, and most recently, drones. Capable of carrying an assortment of cameras and sensors, drones have grown in popularity for tracking elusive creatures or mapping hard-to-reach terrains. They've even been deployed as sample collectors to collect, among other things, whale snot.
But drones are far from perfect when it comes to understanding the complex predator-prey drama that unfolds between bear and musk ox, for several reasons.
They're expensive, challenging to operate and finicky in adverse weather. "You can't have it all," says Mary Cummings, a mechanical engineer at Duke University who has worked with drones as a wildlife management tool in Gabon, Africa. Cummings found that the heat and humidity of Africa caused the machines to burst into flame. Meanwhile, Berger worries the Arctic cold would diminish battery life.
Moreover, when studying elusive creatures, the key is to leave them undisturbed so you can witness their natural behavior. But drones can cause creatures distress. Cummings learned this firsthand while tracking African elephants from the air. Upon the drone's approach, the elephants trunks rose up. "You could tell they were trying to figure out what was happening," they say. As the drones got closer, elephants began to scatter, with one even slinging mud at the noisemaker.
The problem, the researchers later realized, was that the drone mimics the creatures' only nemesis: the African bee.
"Drones have kind of this cool cache," says Cummings. But they worry we've gone a little drone-crazy. "I can't open my email inbox without some new announcement that drones are going to be used in some new crazy way that's going to solve all our problems," they say. Berger agrees. "Sometimes we lose sight about the animals because we are so armed with the idea of a technological fix," they add.
Another option for tracking hard-to-find animals is hiding motion-activated cameras that can snap images or video of unsuspecting subjects. These cameras exploded on the wildlife research scene after the introduction of the infrared trigger in the 1990s, and have provided unprecedented glimpses into the daily lives of wild animals ever since.
For musk oxen, however, observing from the sky or from covert cameras on the ground wasn't going to cut it.
Musk oxen are scarce. But even scarcer are records of bears or wolves preying on the massive creatures. In the last 130 years, Berger has found just two documented cases. That meant that to understand musk ox herd dynamics, Berger needed to get up close and personal with the burly beasts—even if doing so could put them in great personal danger. “We can't wait another 130 years to solve this one,” they say.
When they first suggested their study technique, some of Berger's colleagues laughed. But their idea was serious. By dressing as a grizzly, they hoped to simulate these otherwise rare interactions and study how musk ox react to threats—intimate details that would be missed by most other common study methods.
It's the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that has helped Berger tackle tough conservation questions throughout their career. "We call it Berger-ology," says Clayton Miller, a fellow wildlife researcher at WCS, "because you really have no idea what's going to come out of their mouth and somehow they tie it all together beautifully."
Risks of the trade
When Berger started their work, no one knew what to expect. "People don't go out and hang out with musk ox in the winter," they say. Which makes sense, considering their formidable size and helmet-like set of horns. When they spot a predator, musk oxen face the threat head on, lining up or forming a circle side-by-side with their young tucked behind. If the threat persists, a lone musk ox will charge.
Because of the real possibility that Berger would be killed, the park service was initially reluctant to approve permits for the work. Lawler recalls arguing on behalf of Berger's work to their park service colleagues. "Joel's got this reputation for … these wacky hair-brained ideas," they remember telling them. "But I think you have to do these kinds of far out things to make good advances. What the heck, why not?"
Eventually the organization relented, taking safety measures including sending out a local guide armed with a gun to assist Berger.
Besides the danger, Berger soon found that stalking musk ox is slow-going and often painful work. On average, they can only watch one group each day. To maintain the bear routine, they remain hunched over, scrambling over rocks and snow for nearly a mile in sub-zero temperatures and freezing winds. They sit at a "perilously close" distance to the musk ox, which puts them on edge.
Between the physical challenge and the nerves, each approach leaves them completely exhausted. "When you are feeling really frostbitten, it's hard to keep doing it," they say.
But by weathering these hardships, Berger has finally started to learn what makes a musk ox tick. They can now sense when they're nervous, when they'll charge and when it's time to abort their mission. (When things are looking tense, they stand up and throws their faux head in one direction and their cape in the other. This momentarily confuses the charging musk ox, halting them in their tracks.)
So far he's been charged by seven male musk oxen, never by a female—suggesting that musk oxen do indeed have distinct gender roles in the pack. Moreover, he's found, the presence of males changes the behavior of the herd: When the group lacks males, the females all flee. This is dangerous because, as any outdoor training course will tell you, “you don't run from a [grizzly] bear," says Berger. When the herds bolt, musk oxen—particularly babies—get eaten.
The polar bear that wasn't
The charismatic polar bear has long been the poster child of Arctic climate change. Compared to musk ox, “they're a more direct signal to climate,” says Berger. Polar bears need sea ice to forage for food, and as Earth warms, sea ice disappears. This means that tracking polar bear populations and health gives scientists a window into the impacts of climate change. Their luminous white fur, cuddly-looking cubs and characteristic lumber only make them more ideal as animal celebrities.
As a result, much of the conservation attention—and funding—has been directed toward polar bear research. Yet Berger argues that musk ox are also a significant piece of the puzzle. "Musk ox are the land component of [the] polar equation," Berger explains. Though their connection to climate is less obvious, the impacts could be just as deadly for these brawny beasts.
Musk oxen and their ancestors have lived in frosty climates for millennia. "If any species might be expected to be affected by warming temperatures, it might be them," they say.
Moreover, musk oxen have their own charisma—it's just rare that people get to see them close enough to witness it. The easiest time to spot them, says Berger, is during winter, when the animals' dark tresses stand in stark contrast to the snowy white backdrop. "When you see black dots scattered across the hillside, they are as magic," they say.
From Greenland to Canada, musk oxen around the world face very different challenges. On Wrangle Island, a Russian nature preserve in the Arctic Ocean, the animals are facing increased encounters with deadly polar bears, but less direct climate impacts. To get a more complete picture of musk oxen globally, Berger is now using similar methods to study predator interactions with the herds on this remote island, comparing how the creatures cope with threats.
"We can't do conservation if we don't know what the problems are," says Berger. "And we don't know what the problems are if we don't study them." By becoming a member of their ecosystem, Berger hopes to face these threats head on. And perhaps their work will help the musk ox do the same.
"We won't know if we don't try," they say.
Is It All in Your Head? True Stories of Imaginary Illness by Suzanne O'Sullivan Other Press, 291 pp., $26.95
Several years ago, my right wrist became swollen and inflamed. My primary care physician ordered blood tests and X-rays, but the cause remained obscure. Empirical treatment with a splint and anti-inflammatory medication did not improve my symptoms, and so I was referred to a hand surgeon. They ordered further tests, including a bone scan, which evaluates not only the wrist but all of the bones in the body. That night, the surgeon called me at home.
“I just saw the results of the bone scan,” they said. “The wrist is not your major concern. It looks like there are multiple metastases in your ribs. You're an oncologist. You need to speak with one of your colleagues about what to do next.”
I hung up the phone in shock, and within minutes my ribs felt as if they had been hit by a hammer. I lay down and took deep breaths, but the pain did not abate.
My wife, also a physician, was away on a ski trip. After several hours of phoning, I finally reached them They tried to be reassuring, saying what I already knew, that bone scans can produce artifacts, suggesting disease where none exists. First thing in the morning, they said, I should have X-rays of my ribs; if there really were multiple cancer deposits, they would be obvious.
I was unable to sleep. Although I realized that I had had no discomfort before the call from the surgeon, I couldn't shake the sense that the accelerating pain was confirming what the bone scan had found. And as a cancer specialist, I knew the implications were dire. Few tumors that have metastasized to bones can be cured.
Early the next morning, I arrived at my hospital's radiology suite. X-rays of the ribs showed nothing abnormal. Slowly, the pain subsided.
I didn't expect my reaction to the surgeon's telephone call. During training, medical students often become hypochondriacal, developing symptoms of a disorder like Hodgkin's disease after learning about it. I didn't. And in one of our classes, a psychiatrist demonstrated techniques of hypnosis, selecting me as a subject. I proved not to be “suggestible,” a person who can be easily hypnotized. But after the incident with the deceptive bone scan, I experienced how powerful the mind can be in generating bodily symptoms.

Chilean President Sebastian Pinera says 33 miners are alive and contact has been established with them 17 days after a structural collapse trapped them below ground.
"All 33 of us are well inside the shelter," Pinera said on Sunday, waving a message scribbled in red pencil that the trapped miners sent to rescuers on the surface through a shaft drilled 700 metres below the ground.

"This came out of the ground. It's a message from our miners telling us they are alive, that they are together," Pinera told reporters outside the mine, 800km north of Santiago.
The miners have been trapped since August 5 in the San Jose gold and copper mine near the northern city of Copiapo. Until Sunday there had been no word from them, and hopes for their survival were fading.
Spiralling house prices in Oxford, Cambridge and London mean that universities are spending tens of millions of pounds to help academics buy homes, Times Higher Education has discovered.
A total of £21 million has been invested in loan programmes and joint equity schemes by the universities of Oxford, Cambridge and University College London over the past five years, according to data obtained by THE using Freedom of Information requests.
But there are warnings that such assistance risks inflating local house prices, could be unfair to professional and support staff unable to use the schemes, and fail to solve the underlying problem of unaffordable housing.
Cambridge was the biggest spender over the past five years. It offers a shared equity scheme to professors, readers, lecturers and “academic related and assistant staff” above a certain grade.
The university puts in a maximum of £500,000 and academics have to pay interest of 2 per cent on Cambridge's investment.
Meanwhile, UCL offers loans of up to one year's salary to newly appointed academic staff from lecturer upwards, and senior administrative staff.
Oxford gives housing loans to professors, but according to William James, pro-vice-chancellor (planning and resources), it would be switching to a Cambridge-style joint equity scheme that would continue to be largely targeted at professors. Most individual colleges also offered some kind of loan or joint equity scheme, they said.
Danny Dorling, Halford Mackinder professor of geography at Oxford and writer on unaffordable housing in the UK, said that such schemes had serious drawbacks.
“The problem is that it increases the inflation in the local housing market. It makes the problem worse,” they said.
They argued that for universities investing in the housing market, “it could be quite a foolish thing to do. We're in a housing bubble, we don't know when there will be a crash.”
Amount spent over past five years on loans and joint equity schemes for staff housing
Note: UCL (calendar not academic years. In 2014-15, the UCL total is to the end of Nov 2015)
It could also be “divisive” if schemes were open to one type of staff but not another. “Universities have many, many staff members, not just academics,” they said.
More generally, helping academics to get on the housing ladder would not isolate universities from the broader impacts of the housing crisis, Professor Dorling said. “You need to be in a functioning city”, which requires affordable housing, they argued.
Professor James said that the fundamental problem was the “overheated property market” in Oxford and they supported the lifting of green belt restrictions “in a selective way” to allow the city to expand.
Because new homes in Oxford were liable to be “snapped up” by London commuters, the university was looking at developing affordable rental accommodation for its staff, particularly postdocs who often had to rent expensive and poor quality properties, they said.
Cambridge has already pursued this kind of solution – its new North West Cambridge Development is set to house 1,500 university and related organisation staff if they cannot afford market rents.
Asked whether it was fair to target housing assistance at professors, Professor James said: “we can only justify it to discharge our charitable mission” to educate, and insisted that “it's not making the assumption that other staff aren't important”.
A spokesperson for Cambridge said that it was “committed to attracting and retaining the best students and staff from all over the world. We are therefore working with local partners to tackle this issue [of high demand for housing].”
“The shared equity scheme forms part of this work, alongside building new and affordable houses which is vital to the economic health of the region,” they said.
A UCL spokesperson said its spending was likely to fluctuate "quite a bit", as shown by the figures, and would not necessarily keep going up every year. "Generally, we'd expect to spend more in the lead-up to [research excellence framework] exercises for instance (as was the case in 2013)," they said.
They added that the number of UCL house loans was "very low" in the context of the London market and so "would have no significant impact on house prices overall" in the capital.

Venezuela's opposition leader Leopoldo López has handed themselves in to the authorities after coming out of hiding to attend a rally of supporters in Caracas.
After the protests that left three people dead last week, there was relief on the streets that a violent repeat might be avoided. Lopéz's defiance in recent days appears to have raised their profile as a figurehead of the resistance to President Nicolás Maduro.
The Harvard-educated politician has been accused of terrorism for encouraging the anti-government protests in several cities that saw fierce clashes between opposition demonstrators, police and colectivo militia groups loyal to the government.
But in a speech to several thousand supporters dressed in white, López denied the charges and said they were turning themselves in to a corrupt justice system as a means of promoting non-violent reform.
"I have nothing to hide. They want to jail Venezuelans who want peaceful, democratic change," they said from a plinth for the statue of 19th century Cuban independence hero José Marti in Plaza Brion de Chacaíto. "This is the first step in the construction of the road for change and it must, by necessity, be a peaceful process."
Flanked by members of their Popular Will party, they walked towards a barricade where they were escorted away by police and national guardsmen.
Despite the peaceful rhetoric, the spectre of violence again raised its head elsewhere in Venezuela as government forces moved in on demonstrations. In the town of Carupano a student was reported to have been hit by a car and killed during protests, the Reuters news agency said, while the Associated Press said 11 protesters were wounded by gunfire at a demonstration in the city of Valencia. The reports cited residents and local officials.
In Caracas, their supporters said they had turned out despite fears of fresh clashes. "I am afraid because of the violence I have seen, but I am more afraid of the course my country has taken," said López supporter Ingrid Lopez, an accountant. "I am here today to tell the government it is unfit to lead this country."
When police helicopters buzzed overhead, the crowd shouted their defiance and waved their hands to show that nobody was armed.
Watched by heavily-armed security forces and blocked by barriers, the protesters were prevented from reaching their final destination.
Although the ruling bloc notched up impressive support during municipal elections last December, discontent about the government's handling of the economy and public security is high. Inflation is running above 56% – the highest rate in the world.
There are shortages of many essential commodities, such as toilet paper and milk. Caracas has one of the highest murder rates in the world.
"I am not sure how we will wake up tomorrow," said Jorge Farias a motor-taxi driver from Petare, a shanty town in western Caracas.
"This country can't stand this much longer – this insecurity in the streets, and these food shortages."
Tensions and suspicions are still running high in the capital after funerals were held last week for the dead, who included Juan "Juancho" Montoya, a colectivo leader from the 23 de enero (23 January) neighbourhood of Caracas.
Underlining the tension, officials said on Monday that a 17-year-old youth, Jose Ernesto Mendez, was killed by a truck during a protest in Carupano, part of an ongoing wave of demonstrations, particularly by students.
López has emerged as the most radical voice of the opposition, whose leader Henrique Capriles has adopted a less confrontational and more pragmatic approach in dealing with a government that controls parliament, the courts, the media and the military.
Maduro now faces a tricky political decision. If the case goes to trial, it could create a platform for López. If they are jailed, the opposition would have a powerful new cause célèbre.
The government blamed the US for stirring up trouble in the oil-rich nation. On Monday three US diplomats were ordered to leave within 48 hours because of their alleged involvement in the disturbances.
The foreign minister, Elias Jaua, said the expelled diplomats had met student activists at private universities "for training, financing and creating youth organisations through which violence is promoted in Venezuela". The US government denies this.
Parents say that children at Risca Primary have been banned from riding their bikes to school.
Ceri Jeffries, 32, has three ten-year-olds at the school and says they are shocked the school has taken this decision considering its “eco” status.
Them children normally cycle in a group with four other children, cutting the twenty minute walk down to a five minute ride.
But now they say they cannot bring their bikes on site, and have to chain them outside the grounds if they decide to continue cycling.
Mrs Jeffries said they understood the school bike shed was to be removed.
They said: “The school is an eco- friendly school but has decided that children are no longer allowed to cycle to and from school, even though children have been doing this for years, including myself as a child.”
They said teachers had cited safety concerns, but added the amount of cars near the school was at least as problematic.
Mrs Jeffries said: “As you can imagine this has upset quite a lot of children and their parents. Childhood obesity is on the rise and promoting healthy eating and exercise is a must. What better way to promote this by encouraging children to cycle to school and by doing so reducing the amount of cars, making it safer for children and the environment?”
Rachel Guy, mother of two children at the school, said they met with head teacher Jayne Arthur about the policy. Mrs Guy said: “I said to Mrs Arthur, "It's absolutely ridiculous." They said it's a health and safety issue.
“My kids rode yesterday, to make a stand really. I'm hoping they haven't been told off.”
Mrs Guy and Mrs Jeffries both said they were told the bike shed would be removed to create extra parking spaces for staff.
The school holds a cycling safety course each year when pupils bring their bikes to school for three weeks.
Mrs Jeffries said: “I also asked if safety measures are to be put into place for this short time, why can't they be put into place permanently? This apparently isn't an option.”
Head teacher Jayne Arthur said: “We are currently working alongside the council's Road Safety and Health and Safety teams to review the situation and complete risk assessment and traffic survey of the school site. Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our pupils remains our utmost priority, and we are seeking to resolve this issue as soon as possible”.
A spokesperson for Caerphilly Council said the council did not want to issue an official statement, adding: “I'm aware of the situation. It's a school policy rather than a Caerphilly-wide policy and it's at the discretion of the school.”
THOUSANDS of people have descended on the North York Moors for their celebration of stargazing, the inaugural Dark Skies Festival.
The North York Moors authority, in collaboration with the Dales National Park, staged the festival, which included a week of events and activities for a variety of ages.
The national parks, which are areas of relatively little light pollution, are hoping to increase levels of "astro-tourism".
The festival was the first visitor-focused joint event that the North York Moors and Yorkshire Dales national parks have done together.
A spokesperson said that it was such a success they hoped to combine future campaigns and events in this way. Particularly successful, they said, was working with local schools, with local businesses getting involved and interest in the dark skies over the parks increasing.
Visitor numbers are still being collated so the total figures are expected to go up, but nearly 4,000 people visited the Sutton Bank National Park centre over the half-term week, and almost 3,500 visited the Moors National Park Centre at Danby.
Julie Crocker, visitor centre coordinator at the Sutton Bank National Park Centre in the North York Moors National Park, said: "We held a telescope-making event during the Dark Skies festival where children made and decorated a telescope. It proved to be very popular with families. We also had a variety of crafts associated with Dark Skies which were available all week.
"These activities were also very popular and we now offer a permanent craft table with themed crafts at the centre."
Events were held at the Dalby Forest Visitor Centre in Low Dalby, Rievaulx Terrace, Sutton Bank National Park Centre and the Moors National Park Centre at Danby, which has just been granted dark skies status.
Michael Graham, assistant director of park services, said: "The location of the visitor centre, just outside the village of Danby, makes it an ideal spot for visitors to step outside and simply look skywards to see the beauty of the stars.
"We now have three fantastic official sites that people can easily reach to go on a celestial safari."
Among the events, there were trails through Dalby forest, crafts, telescope making, a night-vision wildlife tour, open telescope sessions, "celestial safaris" and a lecture on "brown dwarf" stars by Dr Stuart Littlefair, hosted by the Scarborough and Ryedale Astronomical Society (SARAS).
On Saturday there was also an evening star party for families hosted by the Whitby and District Astronomical Society, which featured illustrated talks and expert advice on stargazing.
Gareth Dockerty, forest ranger at Forest Holidays Keldy, said: "Being involved in the Dark Skies activities was a fantastic way to show not only the beautiful skies, but also to promote the wildlife."
The coming year will also see a schedule of cosmos-related events. For more information, visit northyorkmoors.org.uk
Black Men May Have Cause To Run From Police, Massachusetts High Court Says
A black man who runs from police shouldn't necessarily be considered suspicious — and merely might be trying to avoid "the recurring indignity of being racially profiled," the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court says.
The court made that observation as it overturned the conviction of a man who was charged with carrying a firearm without a permit after they ran from a Boston police officer who, the court says in its ruling, "lacked reasonable suspicion" to try to stop them in the first place.
As member station WBUR reports, the court cited "Boston police data and a 2014 report by the ACLU of Massachusetts that found blacks were disproportionately stopped by the city's police" as it threw out the 2011 gun conviction of Jimmy Warren.
The court also cited "a factual irony" in how flight from police is viewed and said that in this instance, a Boston police officer decided to approach Warren and a companion despite important factors: The officer was looking for three, not two, suspects, and they had been given only vague descriptions that the suspects were wearing dark clothing and a hoodie.
Some 30 minutes after the crime was reported, Officer Luis Anjos was driving in their police cruiser when they spotted Warren and another man, rolled down the passenger-side window, and yelled, "Hey guys, wait a minute."
Rather than talk to the officer, the court said, "the two men made eye contact with Anjos, turned around, and jogged down a path" into a park. They were apprehended after Anjos called for assistance.
The court wrote:
"Where a suspect is under no obligation to respond to a police officer's inquiry, we are of the view that flight to avoid that contact should be given little, if any, weight as a factor probative of reasonable suspicion. Otherwise, our long-standing jurisprudence establishing the boundary between consensual and obligatory police encounters will be seriously undermined."
Discussing how a person's race can also be a factor, the Massachusetts court said it's important to consider a recent Boston Police Department report "documenting a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston."
Noting that black men were more likely to be targeted by Boston police for encounters such as stops, frisks, searches, observations and interrogations, the judges wrote, "We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop."
But the judges went on to say that flight alone does not prove "a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt."
The targeting of black males by police for "field interrogation and observation" — FIO — changes the equation, the court said, and "suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt."
The court wrote:
"Such an individual, when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity. Given this reality for black males in the city of Boston, a judge should, in appropriate cases, consider the report's findings in weighing flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion calculus."
According to WBUR, Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans was unhappy with the court's ruling, saying that the judges failed to consider the broader context and gave too much weight to the ACLU's analysis of the department.
The Boston police study says that since 2010, the force has made "significant changes" in the way it operates, including new training, documentation requirements, and meeting with community members and the ACLU to discuss best practices.
Some of the changes have been relatively simple, such as Evans urging officers to hand out business cards after encounters with the public. But others have been more complicated: Earlier this month, a judge sided with Evans in their dispute with the city's largest police union over the commissioner's plan to institute a police body camera program.
As The Associated Press reported, a compromise deal had called for 100 officers to volunteer to wear the cameras in a pilot program — but after no officers stepped forward, Evans issued an order requiring officers to wear them.
Over 600 academics thus far have signed a new letter opposing an academic boycott of Israel. The signatories include at least one Nobel Prize winner, law school deans, and leading scholars in several fields (that is just based on the some of the signatories I personally know; I have not looked over the whole list).
The statement takes no position on the Israeli-Arab conflict, and tries to to be as neutral as possible about everything other than BDS itself. The key parts of the letter are below; it is open for signature by any college or university faculty faculty or academic staff, including librarians, researchers, post doctorates, etc.
We, the undersigned … oppose faculty or student boycotts of Israel's academic institutions, scholars and students. Our opposition is rooted in the following core principles. 1. Academic freedom: The BDS (boycott, divestment and sanctions) movement discriminates against Israeli institutions, professors, and students for no other reason than their nationality and the policies of their government. Thus BDS violates the very principle of academic freedom. Academic boycotts such as those promoted by BDS activists “are antithetical to the fundamental principles of the academy, where we will not hold intellectual exchange hostage to the political disagreements of the moment,” according to a statement signed by 300 university presidents in 2007, and additional statements written by over 250 university presidents last year in response to the ASA boycott of Israel. The American Association of University Professors, other academic organizations, and more than forty Nobel Laureates have opposed all academic boycotts for this reason. 2. Truth: The factual record does not support the accusations and narratives of the BDS movement. Many are based on overstatements, cherry picked evidence, outright falsehood, or on disputed or highly biased data. 3. Peace: The two-state solution – which guarantees to both parties mutual recognition – enjoys the endorsement of the United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and the Arab League. By demonizing and seeking to isolate one of the two parties to the peace process, the anti-Israel BDS movement sets itself apart from the global consensus for peace.
I have signed the letter, and would do so for any such statement about academic boycotts of any country, including those whose policies I particularly detest. I would not want an Iranian leader speaking at my campus, but cannot imagine extending that objection to an Iranian professor. While government control and intimidation in authoritarian countries may make scholarship less reliable or interesting, I cannot see a justification for any non-merit-based boycott. Indeed, I have had some useful correspondence on maritime piracy with Iranian academics.
A few months back, we announced Christopher Ward's update to their Trident dive watch line. As a fan of not only of what Christopher Ward is doing in their part of the market, but also of the apparent updated Tridents, I immediately contacted them for a sample. Luckily, I was able to get my hands on the version holding their proprietary SH21 5-day automatic caliber. Let's take a closer look at the Christopher Ward Trident COSC 600.
Aesthetically, I think Christopher Ward made all of the right decisions. The bezel, dial, date window, and caseback engraving are all superior to the previous Trident in my eyes. It's clear that CW took a holistic approach in redesigning the Trident line, rather than just make minor adjustments. Going on looks alone, I think the new Trident is one of the slicker looking divers on the market, especially in its price range.
According to their literature, CW has re-worked the case and bracelet with a new manufacturer. From far away, the case and bracelet look very similar to the previous Trident, but the details certainly seem to be of higher quality. The last caseback engraving was little more than an etching, and now the Trident logo on the back would make Omega's hippocampus blush. The bezel action has been tightened up, and feels on par with much more expensive dive watches.
The bracelet is clearly well made, but not without faults. Although I've gotten used to polished centerlinks from my Seamaster, I know a lot of people will complain about them. It's one of a few areas where the intent of the watch is confusing: is it a true diver or a dressy diver? Some folks aren't fans of pushpin clasp releases for security reasons, but I've never had much of an issue with it. However, I would say the diver's extension is a little lacking for a true dive watch, and would have loved to see a micro-adjustable clasp similar to that on the Submariner. I know that's asking a lot from a brand like Christopher Ward, but I'd give up the ceramic bezel in a heartbeat if it meant a more serious clasp. The quick-adjusting clasps are great for divers, but equally useful for the average person's expanding and contracting wrist size.
On the wrist, the Trident wears a bit big – this is my main problem with the watch. The SH21 version is limited to 300 watches, and only comes in 42mm. My assumption on why the watch is so thick (15.55mm) and heavy (113g) is the SH21 is a large caliber. It seems that way because the non-SH21 version is over two millimeters thinner. If the SH21 is dictating the thickness, it's almost forgivable, if only because I think the SH21 is a great step forward for Christopher Ward. I just wonder if they could have slimmed down the case if they kept the water resistance at 300m. For what looks to be a dressy diver, 600m of water resistance is serious overkill. Professional divers might require 600m, but I doubt they would also want to rely on a yet-to-be-proven caliber when they're several hundreds of meters below the surface. I had a hard time wearing it under my cuff, but casual weekend wear was just right. And for those of you who like chunkier watches, I suspect the Trident COSC 600 to be perfect.
Without much doubt, the updated Trident line is a “win” for Christopher Ward. They're pushing the limit on what's possible in their price range. If the slimmer non-SH21 version wears as I think it would, I'd have a hard time overlooking it in the sub-$1,000 dive watch categories. As for the Trident COSC 600, good luck finding another proprietary 5-day automatic movement for about $2,200. It's a seriously great value for someone looking for a dive watch with an interesting movement. Seeing the evolution from the last Trident, I'm confident Christopher Ward will continue to fine-tune the design, and we'll be keeping our eyes on them.

2017 Eminem Is Basically Rachel Maddow In A Hoodie
Caitlin Johnstone Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 11, 2017
My God this is depressing.
The once artistically relevant hip-hop artist Eminem has caused quite the stir in establishment liberal circles today. Corporate Democrats across America are currently squealing with delight over a viral freestyle Marshall Mathers recently aired on the BET Hip-Hop Awards, in which they denounced the sitting president in a way that is indistinguishable from the innocuous neoliberalism-friendly criticisms leveled by the likes of Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid, and Peter Daou.
In what is without a doubt the single whitest thing that has ever happened, Clintonist McResistance millionaire Keith Olbermann publicly praised Eminem's performance with the ejaculation that after 27 years of doubts about rap they are now a fan, adding, “Best political writing of the year, period. [clapping emoticons] #Eminem2020”.
It's unclear why Olbermann singled out the seemingly arbitrary year of 1990 as the beginning of their rap skepticism. Equally perplexing is their inability to appreciate an immensely rich musical genre full of brilliant artists until they saw a caucasian man expressing opinions that can be heard daily on MSNBC. But it is not at all confusing why Olbermann found this particular piece appealing.
Just like every other pro-establishment corporate liberal partisan hack, Mathers voiced support for Colin Kaepernick only in the context of opposing Donald Trump, without saying a single word about the police brutality against African Americans which Kaepernick has been protesting.
Just like every other pro-establishment corporate liberal partisan hack, Mathers gave “props” to Wall Street crony and drone bombing king Barack Obama, decried the way Trump “tormented” and “slandered” Hillary Clinton, defended bloodthirsty neocon John McCain, invoked the “deplorable” pejorative of the Clinton campaign, and said they love the US military.
Just like every other pro-establishment corporate liberal partisan hack, Mathers had nothing to say against the system which forced a nation to choose between an obnoxious billionaire reality TV star and a corrupt warmongering neocon under FBI investigation, nothing to say about how none of the evils Trump facilitates originated with Trump, and nothing to say about the way America's elected officials are essentially lackeys for an unelected plutocracy which thrives on a paradigm of economic injustice which hurts minorities and other disadvantaged groups worst of all.
There was once a time when Eminem was widely considered a legit artist and countercultural icon. In 2017, he's just Rachel Maddow in a hoodie.
Mathers wrapped up their embarrassing display of oligarchic sycophantry with the following verse:
And any fan of mine who's a supporter of theirs
I'm drawing in the sand a line: you're either for or against
And if you can't decide who you like more and you're split
On who you should stand beside, I'll do it for you with this:
“Fuck you!”
Wow, like, boom. That's some dangerous wordcraft you're wielding there, Marshall. Be careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge.
I'm not including the above video by Infowars' Paul Joseph Watson because I agree with them ideologically, but because, in this particular instance, they are absolutely right. Watson is humiliatingly, infuriatingly correct when they say that conservatism has become the new counterculture because pro-establishment liberalism has become the dominant culture in western society. Corporate fauxgressivism is now the official ideology of the mainstream music industry, Hollywood, social media providers and other key areas of cultural influence, which is why you're now seeing Eminem regurgitating CNN talking points with pasty old oligarchic stalwarts cheering them on. If a young man wants to find something that'll piss off their parents and teachers, he'll now have much better odds looking to the Kekistanis on 4chan than to any famous hip-hop artist.
I'm not saying it's a good thing that conservatism has become the new counterculture, I'm just saying it's true. The corporate liberals are winning the culture war, the anti-establishment conservatives are winning the counterculture war, and meanwhile those of us who are on the actual left side of the political spectrum are sitting out in the cold while our presidential candidate gets one percent of the popular vote.
This has got to change. As long as the true left is allowing itself to be shouted down into silence and submission by the dominant mainstream liberal culture, we'll be lost in the margins while the establishment Democrats duke it out with the right-wingers. Nobody wins in that battle. If you recognize the status quo as bullshit and partisan politics as a farce, speak up! Make noise! Make art — for fuck's sake, please make art! And when they try to shout you down, shout louder! Speak your truth like you mean it, and say it like you're right, because you are.
Don't settle for Eminem, please. Let's create a real counterculture and usher in something fresh.

There are a few picture takers who like to click pictures and convert them into high contrast photographs in the after generation stage. There's nothing amiss with this method; it's simply that it is tedious. Things being what they are, rather than changing over the photographs into highly contrasting later, wouldn't it be smarter to shoot photographs in highly contrasting in any case?
In the present advanced world, the vast majority incline toward full shading photos while highly contrasting photography is viewed as a relic of times gone by. In any case, there are numerous picture takers who decide on monochromatic pictures. Such high contrast pictures can show basic, crude feelings of the general population and delightful scenes that can't be appeared through shading photographs.
Highly contrasting photos underline characteristics like light and shadow, example and surface. Shooting such monochromatic pictures is a craftsmanship that requires more consideration regarding gear, process, sythesis, tonality and lighting. How about we look at a portion of the vital methods to make striking monochromatic pictures through computerized or moment photograph cameras.
The greater part of the computerized and moment photograph cameras accessible, nowadays, have a high contrast preset. This element can be utilized to take photographs straightforwardly in highly contrasting. It is desirable over shoot in the camera's RAW organization and utilize the highly contrasting preset. Crude configuration furnishes picture takers with expanded power over the last photo.
The picture takers will most likely view the highly contrasting transformation on the camera's showcase when shooting in RAW configuration. The highly contrasting photographs showed on the camera's screen give picture takers a see of the way the high contrast form would look.
Shoot at the Lowest ISO Setting
Despite the fact that the grainy film look is generally utilized in high contrast photography, it is best to adhere to the most minimal conceivable ISO setting for taking photographs. Most picture takers think it is smarter to include the grainy look in after generation. Prior, picture takers used to add this grainy look to their photographs by utilizing high ISO films on their moment cameras.
Shooting in high ISO creates picture commotion, so it is desirable over shoot in the most reduced ISO setting. It's desirable over get a sharp shot with slight commotion as opposed to a quiet shot in which the subject is a haze.
Shoot on Those Gray Days
The dull, dim winter days are the best, common shooting conditions for catching extraordinary quality, high contrast photographs.
The delicate light amid such days gives sleek, smooth changes regarding the matters. This fills in as the ideal shooting conditions for the utilization of computerized or moment cameras for taking some phenomenal, high contrast photographs.
Figure out how to See Black and White
It is important to see the world in monochromatic hues for pulling off stunning, high contrast photography. When a picture taker trains themselves to find in high contrast, it ends up simpler to choose circumstances that are appropriate for highly contrasting photography. It is desirable over envision the subject in highly contrasting before making a go. The picture taker needs to take a gander at the subject as far as shadows and complexities, lines and shapes.
This will help in deciding the perfect way in which that subject should be caught. This may likewise enable the picture taker to catch the subject in an alternate point that they had not thought of before. The essential thought is to get into the highly contrasting headspace that can help in picking a totally extraordinary approach to shoot a specific subject.
Utilizing Artificial Lighting
Typically, shadows are utilized in high contrast photography to characterize shapes and subtleties. There is a probability that lighting may hamper the nature of the picture. In nature photography, it is basic to shoot highly contrasting photos diversely instead of the one utilized for shading photographs.
Characteristic Shooting Conditions
With regards to scene photography, it is viewed as best to shoot at day break or nightfall. To put it plainly, when the sun is low and the light is even and delicate. In any case, it is the polar opposite for high contrast photography. So as to make better high contrast photographs, it is best to take photographs amid the center of the day.
Amid this time, heavier shadows are made that assistance in underlining the lines and shapes in the organization. Another way is click photographs when specifically looking towards the sun. This produces amazing states of the trees, windmills and other such solid shapes against the sky.
Shapes will in general cast shadows that feature the state of the subject. The lighting around the subject assumes a major job in how the shadows show it. There is a probability that a plenitude of shading can make excellent shapes disappear. This is the candid wedding photography comes into the image, as it can help in underscoring these structures.
All things considered, we are talking about highly contrasting photography.
High contrast pictures put their best self forward when they are shot casually by a photographic craftsman. With a particular ultimate objective to enhance the idea of these kinds of photos, there are some noteworthy advances any master or learner, photographic craftsman could use while snapping their subjects.
Aside from shapes, the picture takers additionally need to concentrate on structures that are flawless when the subjects are hair, sand, skin or wood. It's important to guarantee that the picture taker doesn't include excessively of a complexity in photographs. The most ideal approach to draw in consideration regarding the subject is to expel shading and cruel differentiation. A picture taker who has an enthusiasm for highly contrasting photography needs to try different things with monochromatic hues and think exceptional methods for shooting.
"I don't think you are supporting Pakistan. If you had taken a stronger line with (Pakistan military ruler) Yahya (Khan), you would have done more for Pakistan."
This is what Indira Gandhi told US President Richard Nixon just days before India-Pakistan war when they met them in Washington in November 1971, according to a US diplomatic cable made public by Wikileaks.
The cable on October 19, 1973 is based on a conversation between then US Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Gandhi.
During their meeting, Moynihan informed Gandhi that Nixon was concerned that developments on the Afghan border in 1973 should not lead to difficulties for Pakistan and that they hoped India would share this view.
It was at this time that Gandhi recalled their conversation with Nixon prior to the Bangladesh crisis.
A cable made public eight years ago by Wikileaks had said that Nixon called Gandhi an "old witch" when Henry Kissinger met them at White House hours after the talks with Gandhi.
The US had sided with Pakistan in the 1971 war and even threatened to move its Seventh Fleet to Indian Ocean. Gandhi had then declared India will not be intimidated by such moves.
In the 1973 cable, Moynihan said Gandhi assured that India indeed saw the independence and integrity of Pakistan as a cornerstone of Indian foreign policy but the policy that country following in Pushtunistan and Baluchistan "would not strengthen" that country but "rather would weaken it".
"What Pakistan subsequently did was not best for Pakistan. As for the Baluchistan and Pushtunistan are internal affairs of Pakistan. India would not interfere. But it never has worked to try to destroy people... Finally Afghanistan has a large Pathan population. It must be concerned that this population not be aroused by events in Pakistan," they wrote.

The White House Boys were abused juvenile inmates at the now-closed North Florida Youth Development Center, that was run by the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. The ‘school' closed last year, after running for 111 years, and the surviving White House Boys are now calling for a stop to child abuse.
On the campus was a building called The White House because of its color, where boys were placed in leg irons, beaten, raped, abused and tortured. Guards administered beatings with a three-foot leather and metal strap, and the beatings were often so severe that the boys' underwear would become embedded into the skin and surgery was required to remove it. Here is a re-enactment video produced by Roger Dean Kiser and others:
This video contains graphic content.
Child advocate and author of The White House Boys: An American Tragedy, Roger Dean Kiser, established an activism/memorial website called thewhitehouseboys.com. Some of the surviving White House Boys traveled to Washington on June 22, to speak and rally in support of a bill to end United States corporal punishment in schools.
The trip did not go well. The speeches got no media coverage. The men are disheartened, and Mr. Kiser states that they are “not sure where to go from here.”
Here are Roger Dean Kiser's speeches, delivered in Washington on June 21 and 22, 2012, and reprinted with permission.
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I DID NOT LIKE MY COUNTRY
by Roger Dean Kiser
There was a time when I did not like my country. When I first arrived I was very small and all seem to be fine. There was a warm bed and every morning we kids got a small cardboard box of Corn Flakes with little bugs running out in every direction when you opened the package; but that was okay.
There didn't seem to be any smiles or laughter in my country and there were certainly were never any hugs; but I was used to that and such things did not seem to be that important to me anyway.
My county was not very big maybe twenty acres or so, or so I thought. I always wondered how we could be at war with someone overseas in 1947 when we didn't have any war stuff like guns, tanks, bombs and planes, stuff like that.
As the weeks passed I began to wonder who those strange people were living outside the six foot chain link fences which surrounded my country. No one on the outside of the fences ever seems to notice me.
By the time I was eight I began to actually hate my country. The yelling, screaming and weekly beatings were something I will remember for many years to come.
Those were my thoughts from the age of three to the age of twelve when I finally started high school and was able to walk outside the gates of the Children's Home Society Orphanage located in Jacksonville, Florida.
By then I began to realize that those twenty some odd acres were really not my country but only a very small area within my country. However, by then the feelings about my country had already been soured.
It was less than three weeks before a few girls at Landon High School made fun of me and I was too embarrassed to enter the classroom. The next thing I knew I was in the Dean of Boy's Office and bent over the desk being wacked with a large heavy wooden paddle with holes drilled in the end of it. After that beating I began to try and figure out how to protect myself and at any cost; even if it meant going to jail or even to prison. My entire attitude changed that day and not for the better.
It took many years for me to appreciate the freedoms and the variety of choices that my country was allowing me to have. It took many years for me to appreciate having the right to get a drink of water or use the bathroom without having to ask permission.
The point here is that young children and teens (for years) look at their immediate surroundings, whether it's their home, a school or an institution, and based on how they are treated by the teachers and other adults entrusted with their care; that will form their opinion(s) of how good or bad their country actually is. I can assure you that there's a lot more to a beating than the actual beating itself. It is the after effects that make a beating dangerous.
There may be some school paddling's that may not have dire consequences. But personally, knowing how I felt at that time and my frame of mind after years of being beaten at the orphanage; is a paddling worth having even one person return to school one day and begin shooting everyone in sight. I don't think so.
If those first school years are felt to be hateful and if they are beaten and mistreated; when they become of age, their feelings and thoughts about society as well as their country will also be hateful, distorted and remain only in the negative. If we love and respect our children then they will love, honor, respect society and its rules. No one wants to protect what they hate or despise. School paddlings only make the situation worse and if we have not learned that by now we have very serious problem at hand.
Corporal Punish in Schools (Friday)
by Roger Dean Kiser
Almost my entire first fourteen years on this earth was spent in an abusive Children's Home Society Orphanage which was located in Jacksonville, Florida.
The beatings with the dreaded sandpaper bolo paddle or the green bamboo cane pole, along with the biweekly sexual molestations by Matron, Mother Winters was very hard for this young boy to bear. No matter who I turned to; not Judge Gooding, not my teachers, not my Sunday school teacher and not even old Topper, the old police officer, who walked the sidewalks surrounding the outside of the orphanage every afternoon would believe me or hear my cries for help.
There was very little doubt when I began high school that things would change. Why wouldn't they? I mean the teachers were much older and much wiser, or so I thought.
As the weeks progressed I began to try and confide in my science teacher, Mr. Dampier and Mr. Young my math teacher. But they just looked upon me as being a very troubled young boy.
One day I was sent to the Dean of Boy's Office because I was late for class. When asked why I was late I told the gentleman that a girl had made fun of my large ears and I was too embarrassed to enter the classroom. I had hoped that they might be considerate and try and understand how that hurt me. But no they did not. Within minutes I was bent over their desk and was being hit with a large wooden paddle with holes drilled in the end. When the beating was over I looked up into their face and they smiled a smile of pleasure. Right then and there I saw that people outside the orphanage were just a mean, cruel and inconsiderate as were the evil matrons working at the orphanage.
Two weeks later I was once again in their office for another nine licks for handing a girl a note. That school paddling, on top of the sandpaper polo paddle and that green bamboo cane pole beatings I got weekly at the orphanage, sure beat any feelings of love, respect or consideration that I might have for others completely out of me.
Many children who receive these in school paddlings already have severe emotional and psychological problems. Considering this important aspect; a teacher's job is to teach in a positive and constructive manner but teaching a child how to hate by beating them with a paddle is neither positive nor constructive.
I am not sure what all that paddling did to me but I do know that it made me hate, despise and distrust those in authority. As a young man; never again would I trust any of them.
Several weeks later I ran away from the orphanage and I never returned to school. Over the next few years I made my way to the Florida Industrial School for Boys Reform School at Marianna where I was beaten bloody on two occasions. Then I made my way to prison for three years.
I was released from Prison on February 6th, 1969 and was never in trouble again. Over the next few years, with only a sixth grade education, I became a child advocate, the author of 30 books on child abuse and became one of the top contributing authors to the Chicken Soup for the Soul Book Series.
There is not a day that goes by that I do not think about this orphanage, high school and reform school beatings and how cruel and inconsiderate people can be.
Teachers are supposed to teach but when they beat a child all they have taught them is how to hate. Hopefully, that aspect of teaching agenda will be taken off the program very shortly.
