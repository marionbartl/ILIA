I get excited every time I'm in someone else's brewery. It's their home, and I get to watch them work. Brewers become so intimately familiar with the personalities of their environment—how the flow should feel, the sounds that are OK (and the ones that aren't), the smells of the mash, the way it looks when every valve is where it's supposed to be. Ultimately, these familiarities are what make the experience magical. In that moment, they're creating and giving birth to a vision.
Brewers believe that this vision is worth all those long hours, sore joints, and endless recipe tweaking. And they look forward to that vision manifesting in a glass, not to mention the smiles that follow.
This is Brendan Prindiville tending to the mash of a Tree House Brewing Company/Creature Comforts Brewing Co. Saison. Brendan and I worked on this beer together last September. Just last week, after a 10-month slumber in French oak puncheons, the beer was bottled. Now it's making its journey through the bottle-conditioning process, finding its way. It was an honor to spend a day with the Tree House folks and witness their magic. I can't wait to taste our vision.

Microsoft heads to court Monday morning to defend its right to disclose when the government requests data on its users. The case, known as Microsoft v. Department of Justice began in 2016 when Microsoft sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) to challenge a part of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) under which the government serves warrants to tech companies. The lawsuit is targeting the constitutionality of accompanying gag orders that prevent tech companies from notifying their users that the federal government is investigating their data.
Microsoft claims that the DOJ is taking advantage of the ECPA, first drafted in 1986, well before the advent of the cloud as we know it now. “The government… has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations,” the lawsuit states.
As Ars Technica reports, Microsoft filed an additional brief on Sunday night arguing that it has “special circumstances” as a third party asserting fourth amendment rights on behalf of its users. The fourth amendment, generally applied to individuals, forbids the government from making “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
Many online privacy advocates have thrown their weight behind Microsoft's lawsuit, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union. As the ACLU explains:
“Microsoft has said that it received more than 5,000 federal demands for customer information or data between September 2014 and March 2016. Nearly half of those demands were accompanied by gag orders preventing Microsoft from notifying the affected customers that the government had requested their information. The majority of those gag orders contained no time limit.”
The case could set a meaningful precedent for technology companies pushing back against secretive government practices around data stored in the cloud. Tech companies large and small compile data on their customers, and the specter of all of that private cloud-based data looms larger than ever under the Trump administration, which is widely expected to prove hostile to many forms of privacy, both online and offline.
In July 2016, Microsoft won a surprise victory in another privacy-based lawsuit against the U.S. government. That case involved a warrant for Microsoft customer emails stored in overseas data centers.
Arnold Schwarzenegger encouraged the director of "Pumping Iron," the documentary that launched him in Hollywood 25 years ago, to re-release it unedited - including a marijuana-smoking scene.
"I would refuse to wipe out that record or change it or alter it because of image's sake," Schwarzenegger said this week. "That would not be true to the filmmaker."
George Butler's critically acclaimed 1977 documentary follows Schwarzenegger as he prepares to defend his Mr. Olympia title against fellow bodybuilders including Lou Ferrigno.
A digitally enhanced version of "Pumping Iron," repackaged with previously unseen footage and interviews with actors and athletes influenced by Schwarzenegger, debuts Friday on the Cinemax channel.
Schwarzenegger retired from bodybuilding after winning the competition and began to build a movie career, including the early "Conan the Barbarian" and the breakthrough "The Terminator." He shot a third "Terminator" this year.
He's also been active in politics, most recently helping to win passage of an after-school-programs ballot measure in California, and has been widely reported as considering running for governor of California in 2006.
"Pumping Iron" follows the then-massively muscled Schwarzenegger working out or trying to psych out his opponents. He comes across as a merry prankster, telling a reporter in one scene that he advised an aspiring bodybuilder to scream, loudly, during poses.
Schwarzenegger may have been putting that reporter on. His claim in the film that he missed his father's funeral because it would have affected a competition was untrue, he says.
It was part of the "docudrama" approach needed to sell a movie about the little-appreciated sport of bodybuilding in 1977, he said in an interview this week.
Each bodybuilder had a part to play in the film and he was the calculating and cocky winner, Schwarzenegger said. "The way to get headlines, to promote the sport, was to make outrageous statements."
His determination, however, was real and apparently boundless. As a child in Austria, he recalls in the film, he dreamed of coming to the United States "and being the greatest."
"I had a vision when I was a kid and I went after that vision, after that goal, after that dream, and I would not let go until it was accomplished," Schwarzenegger said in the interview.
He's equally dedicated now, he said, toward movies and toward projects such as the Special Olympics and his after-school measure.
Schwarzenegger won't say if he has greater political aspirations, but he is unconcerned that any part of his past - such as the drag he takes off a marijuana cigarette in "Pumping Iron" - will hurt him.
"I did smoke a joint and I did inhale," he said, taking a jab at President Clinton's famous statement. "The bottom line is that's what it was in the '70s, that's what I did. I have never touched it since."
"I lived a certain life, I want everyone to know that's the life I lived. As you grow up and as you become more mature, those things change," he said.
"The only one that's perfect is God."
Still fit at 55, Schwarzenegger is proud of the attention he brought to professional bodybuilding and to how Americans perceive weight-training.
Watching "Pumping Iron" again, he said, "I thought about how far the idea of weight resistance training has gone, because in those days no one did it, no athlete, no older person. The medical industry didn't recommend it. Today, everybody's training."

On the north coast of Africa lie the ruins of a city that came within a hairbreadth of defeating the might of Rome. Now archaeologists digging at the famous Circus of Carthage have revealed a startlingly advanced system to cool down horses and chariots during races.
The ancients were obsessed with chariot racing. More than a half-century on, the chariot race in the 1959 Hollywood blockbuster "Ben-Hur" is still one of the most memorable scenes in cinemascope history. But even horses can faint, certainly in the burning heat of North Africa.
Key to the discovery of the clever cooling system at the Circus of Carthage, the biggest sporting arena outside Rome, was the detection of water resistant mortar.
“This kind of mortar is called hydraulic mortar. It's a type of waterproof lime mortar mixed with crushed and pulverized ceramics that the Romans used in hydraulic engineering,” says Frerich Schön of Tübingen University, the water technology specialist who first spotted the material, to Haaretz.
A deadly profession
The discovery was made at the spina, the median strip of the circus, around the ends of which the charioteers would turn during races. The spina would often feature ornate columns and statues.
As was the custom in ancient racetracks, water basins had been placed along the spina of Carthage, the archaeologists realized. Sparsores – sprinklers –would dip clay amphorae into the basins, from which they would sprinkle water on the chariots, says Dr Ralf Bockmann, who is directing the excavation Together with his Tunisian colleague, Dr Hamden Ben Romdhane. (The excavation is being jointly undertaken by the German archeological institute in Rome and the Institut National du Patrimoine of Tunisia.)

This is a common technique at circuses; well-preserved water basins have also been found at the circus of Maxentius outside of Rome on the Via Appia. Water basins of the type are shown on a mosaic from Carthage showing the circus and the spina.
As for the sparsores, this was evidently not a job for the faint of heart. “The sparsores would usually be on foot, directly on the spina, presumably at the level of the arena, to cool down the chariot wheels driving by at high speed. How exactly the cooling was organized is not clear. But for sure, it must have been a dangerous business,” adds Bockmann.
Blood sports and charioteer fan clubs
The Circus of Carthage was the second-largest in the Roman Empire, surpassed only by the Circus Maximum in Rome.
Pioneering, albeit preliminary, geophysical explorations in the 1970s, measured the Carthage arena at 500 meters in length, which is around 80 meters shorter than the Circus Maximus in Rome itself. American excavations in the 1980s measured the width at 77 meters, only 2 meters short of the Circus Maximus. Whereas the Circus Maximus could accommodate over 150,000 people, the capacity of the circus at Carthage seems to have been smaller.

How do we know the ancients were mad for racing? The evidence is legion, including a collection of poems edited in Carthage in the early 6th century CE, which both praises and mocks charioteers. There are mosaics showing the circus itself and inscriptions naming famous drivers and horses.
Gambling on chariot racing was probably as popular as sports betting today. The games were a blood sport and involved frantic danger and excitement. Forget NBA stars or even David Beckham's quarter-billion dollar paycheck: Charioteers were the highest-paid sportsmen in history. One second-century charioteer won almost 36 million sesterces during his career – equivalent to $15 billion today.
The charioteers wore distinct colors, and each team represented a certain group in society, either political or social. Supporters would erupt in frenzy when their favorite team appeared. Charioteers became so popular that people adorned their houses with their portraits. And clashes between rival groups of fans were as commonplace as today. For instance, the Roman historian Tacitus reports on a riot during a sporting event in Pompeii, when Pompeians brawled with fans from the neighboring city of Nucreia.
One thing we do know is that in ancient Greece, women were not allowed to watch sports, let alone participate in them. They could however enter equestrian contests through ownership. The chariot race in Olympia was won by a team owned by a Spartan princess, Cynisca, not once but twice; her triumph was influential in getting other women to field teams that won.
Although we have no record of how much she won, Cynisca - daughter and sister of kings - was the first woman to have a hero shrine erected in her name and to be honored with a statue of herself in the Temple of Zeus in Olympia. Only Spartan kings was graced in this way.
Berbers in the bleachers
Yet another discovery arising from study of the spina is that the Carthage circus had to have been built in at least two phases. "We cannot say yet if these phases indicate a restructuring or enlargement, or simply are the result of distinctive actions within a single construction process,” Bockmann clarifies.
Excavations at the spina, the middle axis of the circus of Carthage.
Aside from the excavation of the spina itself, two other trenches were dug within the monumental Circus. One was to investigate the forerunners of the circus – the buildings that had existed before it, and were torn down to build it. One building seems to have been a mausoleum. Others are older and may well be of Punic origin – built by the original Carthagians, who trace their origins to the Phoenicians and Berbers. (Though genetic analysis of a 2,500-year old Carthagian man, whose body was accidentally discovered by gardeners in 1994, seems to indicate he came from Portugal, while the Phoenicians are thought to have come from Lebanon and the Berbers were indiginous to North Africa.)
The second trench is investigating the "bleachers" – the section where spectators sat and cheered on their favorites. The archaeologists hope this section of the dig will enable the façade and grand stands of the circus to be reconstructed – and will also shed light on the infrastructure of the organization of the games and its connection with the urban topography.
“The circus of Carthage played a great role for civic life as a monument, where large parts of the population would gather to watch the races, over hundreds of years,” Bockmann said.
The circus region, which served to entertain the masses for centuries, is the only part of ancient Carthage that has not been extensively built over in modern times. The archaeologists believe that its relatively untouched nature can bring fresh insights on the development of the ancient city. For instance, “It will be very interesting to reconstruct how the terrain was prepared for the erection of the circus, and what kind of usage dominated before,” Bockmann told Haaretz, adding that the study is just starting and is planned to go on for years.
Hi there,
So today was another round of bug fixes and technical changes.
A lot of work has gone into getting msvc working nicely with Starbound, which will make it far easier for us to debug and bug fix in the future.
We've made sure stack traces are as informative as possible.
We've revamped our performance logging / charts to display additional data.
Vsync and triple buffering were made optional in direct 3D mode, improvements were made to D3D error reporting.
A bunch of GUI work was completed. the GUI is nearing 100% completion. Only a couple more things to add.
The tier 1 boss continues to receive new behaviors (as does it's minions).
Some bug fixes were made to the weather system.
I managed to get hold of some orange sunglasses so I could work outside, now I have a sunburn.
As a freelance developer, I have been involved in numerous Django projects. Moving from smaller projects with only a few apps to complex larger projects is difficult to do. In most cases, I have to get my hands dirty, work on a few bug fixes to familiarize myself with the codebase. Before that though, it's important to set the proper groundwork by establishing expectations with the client and analyzing the code from a higher level.
Obviously, the steps you take will vary greatly depending on what you're hired to do (i.e., adding features, fixing bugs, creating documentation, etc.) as well as how the Django project itself is setup. There are numerous ways to structure a project, which can make it difficult at first to understand the logic.
When approaching a project, I focus on the following areas to quickly get up to speed with the codebase and determine the unknowns.
Initial client communication
Describe the type of work needed and the priority? Will I have access to the current or former developer(s)? How will my role coincide with the current developers? How will I communicate with them? Who am I directly reporting to? Who makes architectural/design decisions?
Resist the temptation to set any expectations during the initial call with regard to development time and basic price points. Take the time to go over the codebase first to see how complex the project is and to determine how long it will take for you to become familiar with their specific project setup.
If both parties decide to move forward, make sure you request login credentials for the superuser, shell access, and their repository. Ideally, you will want to obtain these credentials for the development, staging, and production environments.
Code Review
Once you have cloned their repository, and begin the first pass of their codebase-
Take note of important files/directories (i.e., manage.py, settings.py, urls.py) Determine the relationship between urls, views, and templates (parent vs. child templates). I use an Excel doc to track. How is the project organized? Are best practices followed? Are apps broken up by specific functions? Which installed applications are core to the projects infrastructure? Is there a local settings file? How big is it? The bigger the file, the more that the development environment is going to differ from production. Keep this in mind when testing.
Finally, when going through the code review, address these issues:
Is there a requirements.txt file. No? Do a pip freeze > requirements.txt . Familiarize yourself with the project's dependencies. Have you worked with a specific third-party application before? If not, go read the documentation. Which Django version are they using? Could there possibly be any issues with their current version and the installed applications? Are there any scheduled tasks (cron jobs)? What type of version control system do they have in place? Are they using it correctly? What are their processes? Are unit tests in place? If so, what are they testing - and when? What about integration testing? Are any tests failing? Is South installed? Are they using a virtualenv? Have they separated config from the actual code? Is Fabric used for deployment? How well is the code documented? Is there inline documentation within the codebase itself? How well do they document their version control commits? Can you get a basic sense of their standards, configurations, and/or naming conventions (variables, functions, classes, etc)? When/who ships code? What's the process?
Next steps
I focus my code review on whether I can (a) get an overall sense of the project (e.g., what are they trying to do), and (b) whether I am qualified to take on the project in the first place. If the project has too many unique/non-standard components, it may not be worth taking on.
In the end, all apps have a models.py and a views.py file. Larger projects should also include the urls.py file and tests.py in each application. If this is not the case, it will take longer to document.
Documentation and testing are big red flags. I tend to avoid projects where testing and/or proper documentation are not priorities.
Start at a high-level, reviewing the URLconfs and documenting the basic logic/structure/workflow, then work your way down through the templates, unittests, views, and finally the models. Models tend to hold the most complexity, so having a basic understanding of the project first, will help you greatly when you encounter the models.
Document all unknowns. Ask yourself what else you need to do or know before you can make a reasonable decision about whether you can complete the job, as well as the how long it will take.
Use django-graphviz to quickly visualize the database schema and django-template-analyzer to establish the relationship between parent and child templates.
Be honest and direct with your next communication with the client. Don't be afraid to pass on a project. There's plenty of work out there. Focus on the projects that you can reasonably handle and, above all, make sure you feel comfortable with not only the codebase but your employers as well. Good luck.

During the 8 years he was president, Barack Obama's administration experienced an explosion in gun sales, with annual background checks more than doubling between 2008 and 2016. In the eighteen months leading up to the 2016 election, gun sales set one new record after another.
So when a pro-Second Amendment candidate won the election most observers figured that gun sales would at last begin to drop. But it hasn't worked out that way.
Conventional wisdom held that the sharp rise in gun sales over the course of Obama's presidency was supposedly driven, at least in part, by the threat of gun control. That's why everyone expected gun sales to decline after Trump's victory. Yet, the average monthly gun sales from November through February are up from the already very high level in October.
In fact, there was a large increase in gun sales immediately following the election. November had a record-setting month for FBI background checks. On Black Friday, there was a single day record of 185,713 checks. While December sales were not quite at record levels, they were still the second highest monthly total ever. January's and February's sales data slipped below last January's and February's, but they were still the second highest January and February sales on record.
Anecdotal stories right after the election suggested that people — particularly minorities — might be buying guns out of fear of a Trump presidency. The National African-American Gun Association saw a 7% increase in members just over the Thanksgiving weekend. NBC News contacted gun storeowners who reported seeing up to four times as many black and minority customers. The Liberal Gun Club says that its membership is up 10%. Many news stories quote liberals saying that they bought a gun for the first time after the election.
There were other signs that gun control was losing popularity. “Miss Sloane,” a pro-gun control movie, flopped miserably in December. Despite being heavily advertised and promoted in the mainstream media, the film's second weekend saw an average of fewer than 10 viewers per day per movie theater.
In November, Nevada narrowly passed a ballot initiative that imposes background checks on private transfers. And the victory of less than one percentage point came only as a result of $20 million in spending personally funded by Michael Bloomberg. This amounts to an incredible $35.30 per vote. The same initiative lost in Maine by 4 percent despite similar massive spending. So much for the oft-repeated claim that 80 to 90 percent of Americans favor such laws.
Yet, there is broader statistical evidence that liberals at least temporarily changed their views on guns. Gun sales in November right after the election rose most sharply in the most heavily Democratic states. Among the seven states (plus the District of Columbia) that the New York Times categorizes as consistently voting for Democrats, there was a 20.6% increase in background checks from October to November. By contrast, there was only a 4.5% increase among the 19 states that the Times labeled as consistently Republican.
Excluding California, there was still a 13.1% increase in gun sales in the other heavily Democrat states and DC. This was still almost 3 times the increase in heavily Republican states.
But California's massive 44% increase in sales in November and December was undoubtedly due in large part to new regulations banning the sale of certain guns after December 31st. January's sales in California plummetted so much that they were down 28% below the level in October.
Still January's and February's numbers show that this increase in gun sales in heavily Democratic states was a temporary phenomenon. Excluding California, comparing October with the November through February, background checks increased for both heavily Democratic and Republican states, but the increase for non-California heavily Democratic states was just 0.3%. For heavily Republican states
On the other hand, heavily black states also experienced larger post-election sales and the trend continued through February. Comparing background checks in October to the average monthly rate in November through February, the 25 states with the highest percentage of blacks had more than twice the relative increase in gun background check compared to October relative to the 25 states where blacks are relatively underrepresented. (The 25 most heavily black states averaged 18% black and the 25 least black states averaged just 3.3% black.) Monthly gun sales in November through February increased by 8.2% in the heavily black states but actually fell by 2.7% in the other ones.
These changes fit in with general national trends in gun use and ownership. The number of concealed handgun permits has soared from about 4.6 million in 2007 to 14.5 million in 2016. And over the last four years some data indicates that permit-holding has been increasing about 75% more quickly among minorities than among whites. The number of women with permits has increased twice as quickly as the number of men with permits.
According to a December 2014 PEW poll, 57 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership “protects people from becoming victims of crime.” Thirty-eight percent believe that it “puts people's safety at risk.” That's an 8-percentage point increase in positive views from just two years earlier. Except for Democrats as a whole, every group identified by PEW had come to view gun ownership more positively.
The two groups with the largest attitudinal shifts were blacks and women. Compared to two years before, nearly twice the percentage of blacks answered that gun ownership does more to protect them than harm them. It rose from 29 to 54 percent. For women, the increase was 11 percentage points.
Gallup polls have also shown remarkable changes over time. In 2000, only 35% of respondents thought that guns in the home made them safer. By the end of 2014, that answer was shared by 63% of people. Even 41% of Democrats answered that way.
The sale numbers imply that while the sudden increase in gun sales in Democrat states was likely temporary, a more fundamental change might be occurring for blacks. Why Republicans keep buying guns at high rates is still a question. It surely doesn't fit the mantra that “fear drives gun sales.”
As women and minorities come to support gun ownership in increasing numbers, gun control advocates will find themselves facing an uphill battle.

RUMOR, just like the Just so it's abundantly clear, this is just another, just like the AMAZON RUMOR
Narg received the following email in his inbox:
A friend of mine told me he has a friend who works at Sony who told him it's not Amazon but AMC that got the rights. I asked him to confirm and he said he would, but considering I told him Amazon and he said, No, it's AMC, and Sony's involved, too...well, I never mentioned Sony in any way, so he heard it first from his friend. Hope that helps.
The Amazon rumor was from a friend who worked at amazon and this one is from a friend who knows a friend who works at Sony. Narg advises viewing both rumors with skepticism. Given the complete and utter lack any official news on who actually acquired the rights, Narg is not going to say one rumor has more credibility than the other. We do now though have to conflicting rumors, so either someone's friend is talking shit, or Sony may have the rights but has been shopping around for someone to partner with them.From Legal documents surrounding the slander case brought against Harriet by REE, we know that Harriet was flown out to meet withregarding a. Sony being involved wouldn't be all that surprising. So what about AMC?Narg did a bit of googling and came up with one connection betweenand. AMC interviewed Brandon Sanderson 8 years ago about being picked to finish Wheel of Time. One of the questions was "Universal has optioned the series. Do you think it's possible to make a movie of this scope?".So not only was someone over at AMC interested in The Wheel of Time they also seemed to be thinking that WoT was to big in scope to work in movie format. Narg finds it odd AMC even interviewed Sanderson on their site but maybe they interview people all the time about stuff that has no relation to their shows?Now would AMC be a good fit? Well they do have great shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Hell on Wheels, Better Call Saul and Into the Badlands. Do they have the budget? Well the first season of The Walking Dead was 3.4 million per episode which clearly isn't going to cut it and getting budget figures on recent shows like Into the Badlands is beyond Narg. AMC is known for being frugal which is a bit of a worry but if it's a co production with Sony that may help.Season length? Well recent shows like Better Call Saul, The Son, The Terror and Into the Badlands(season 2) have had 10 episodes per season but other shows like The Walking Dead and Fear The Walking Dead have had 16 and 15. AMC seems to start with a short first season to test things out before committing to longer seasons for expensive shows. Walking, Fear and Badlands all had 6 episode first seasons.AMC wouldn't be Narg's first pick based on just budget reasons, but Narg would still be happy if it was them as they do put out some great shows.So there you have it, another rumor, make of what you will.Narg has changed his mind. Narg now believes this rumor to bethan the Amazon one.While the Sony part turned out to be true, AMC are unlikely to be the network.
Fancy a pub vibe in your own home, where you can chill with your best friends and a pint of ale? These two couples, who live next door to each other, decided to build their own tavern for just that purpose.
Kelvin and Samantha Mayes and Robert and Helen Sheldon from Willenhall, West Mids created a shed-like structure and filled it with pub paraphernalia, including a blackboard sign which says 'we never close'.
Kelvin Mayes, a 46-year-old driving instructor, told the Express and Star : ‘We started homebrewing and it has all stemmed from there.
‘We were quite pally with the neighbours and just wanted somewhere to drink other than our front room.'

They used mostly recycled items, which they mainly procured from eBay, including a disco ball.
The most expensive item was the £40 roof, while old bus seats have doubled up as banquettes and the bar is an old work surface.
The couples aren't just DIY-savvy; they also brew their own drinks to enjoy at this unique local.
They have named it The Outback Inn because it is literally 'out the back' of their garden, and the decor has more than a touch of Australiana with some kangaroos and boomerangs on the walls.
Mr. Mayes added: "We had some friends over for a barbecue in the summer and they were just gobsmacked, honestly gobsmacked."
"We just keep adding to it now.

CLEVELAND, Ohio -- An armed and bandana-clad teenager held at gunpoint by Cleveland police Friday reached into his waistband and pulled out what officers thought was a revolver.
The officers kept their guns on the 15-year-old boy and continued ordering him to the ground until he complied and was arrested unharmed, according to a police report first made public Wednesday.
The arrest is the latest example of officers encountering toy guns that look like real guns.
Here's what police said happened:
An off-duty Cleveland police officer stopped at a red light at West 56th Street and Denison Avenue saw three boys walking near a car wash about 11:50 p.m. Friday. One of the boys wore a red bandana over his face. He pulled out a gun and started walking towards the officer's truck.
The officer backed up and drove away, then called police. Officers found the boy, still wearing the bandana over his face, and two other boys walking on West 50th Street near Denison Avenue.
They drew their guns and ordered them to the ground. After the boy in the bandana got on the ground, officers took all three into custody.
The gun turned out to be a Crossman .177 caliber pellet gun that police said was "very real looking for both a trained or untrained eye." The two other boys, whose ages were not given, told officers the 15-year-old boy was "looking to rob people," and the 15-year-old admitted to pointing the gun at a man he thought he knew.
The 15-year-old was arrested, and the two other boys were cited for curfew violation and taken home.
The incident comes amid a call to make toy guns more distinct from real weapons. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, introduced legislation in January that would mandate bright paint and other markings on B.B. guns and other fake firearms.
The renewed call came months after the Nov. 22 shooting where Cleveland police shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice after officers said he reached for an airsoft pellet gun in his waistband outside the Cudell Recreation Center.
Google today continued the trend of cloud services price cuts, while claiming that cloud network operators aren't cutting average prices quickly enough. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google frequently advertise price cuts, but Google today claimed that "pricing hasn't followed Moore's Law: over the past five years, hardware costs improved by 20-30 percent annually, but public cloud prices fell at just 8 percent per year."
In today's announcement, unveiled at Google's Cloud Platform Live event, the company said, "We think cloud pricing should track Moore's Law, so we're simplifying and reducing prices for our various on-demand, pay-as-you-go services by 30-85 percent." Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles about every two years, bringing steady increases in processing power.
One Amazon price cut last year was on the order of 37 to 80 percent for its dedicated instances, so this actually isn't that unusual. Google declined to say which companies it included in its "public cloud prices" statistic.
UPDATE: A day after this story published, Amazon unveiled price cuts of its own ranging from 10 to 65 percent.
Google's latest price cut is a broad one, affecting many services used by developers. Google Compute Engine, an infrastructure-as-a-service platform, will get a 32 percent price cut "across all sizes, regions, and classes," Google said. Here are Compute Engine prices before today: And here are the new prices effective April 1: Google Cloud Storage, which helps developers serve data to the users of their applications, "is now priced at a consistent 2.6 cents per GB," the company said. "That's roughly 68% less for most customers."
The platform-as-a-service offering Google App Engine will have simplified pricing, "with significant reductions in database operations and front-end compute instances." Finally, there is an 85 percent price cut for on-demand capacity in Google BigQuery, a service that lets you "run fast, SQL-like queries against multi-terabyte datasets in seconds."
"In addition to lower on-demand prices, you'll save even more money with Sustained-Use Discounts for steady-state workloads," Google said. "Discounts start automatically when you use a VM for over 25 percent of the month. When you use a VM for an entire month, you save an additional 30 percent over the new on-demand prices, for a total reduction of 53 percent over our original prices."
In addition to price cuts, Google unveiled a managed virtual machine service that brings more flexibility to App Engine without sacrificing its auto-management features.
"You can start with App Engine, and if you ever run into a case where you need more control, or need to use a language or library that App Engine doesn't support, you can replace part of your application with a VM," Google said. "For example, your application may need access to a native resource, such as a file system or network stack; or you might require a library or framework that is only available in C or C++. Current Platform as a service offerings lack this type of support, and developers are forced off the cliff into an Infrastructure as a service world. With Managed VMs, this is not the case."
Because App Engine is designed to hide some of the complexity of running virtual machines from developers, Google still handles management and scaling, "ensuring that deployments are collocated, monitored, and running smoothly, with minimal network latency," the company said. The managed VM service is available to some early access users and will "soon" be more widely available in a "preview" or beta mode.
Some other new developer features were described by Google as follows:
Build, test, and release in the cloud, with minimal setup or changes to your workflow. Simply commit a change with git, and we'll run a clean build and all unit tests.
Aggregated logs across all your instances, with filtering and search tools.
Detailed stack traces for bugs, with one-click access to the exact version of the code that caused the issue. You can even make small code changes right in the browser.
Additionally, Google Compute Engine will now support Windows Server 2008 R2 in a "limited preview," with broader support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Service.
Amazon announced a cloud update of its own this week, with new networking capabilities for its Virtual Private Cloud service.
Hypocrites Unite!
At least we have some ideals to fall short of.
By George Monbiot. Published on the Guardian's Comment is Free site, 6th August 2008
In her new book, Not In My Name, Julie Burchill reserves her grandest fury about hypocrites for environmentalists. We are, she says, pious, sexless and contemptuous of humankind. All of us are posh and rich, and have found in environmentalism a new excuse for lecturing the poor. We tell other people to live by rules we don't apply to ourselves.
Like all stereotypes, these claims are lazy, familiar and sometimes true. Burchill knows nothing about environmentalism and, almost as a point of pride, hasn't bothered to find out, but when you use grapeshot you are bound to hit someone. Yes, many prominent greens are posh gits like me. The same can be said of journalists, politicians, artists, academics, business leaders: in fact of just about anyone in public life. But it is always the greens who are singled out. In truth, while the upper middle classes are, as always, over-represented in the media, the movement cuts across the classes. A recent ICM poll found that more people in social classes D and E thought the government should prioritise the environment over the economy (56%) than in classes A and B (47%)(1).
Environmentalism is the most politically diverse movement in history. Here in the climate camp I have met anarchists, communists, socialists, liberals, conservatives and – mostly – pragmatists. I remember sitting in a campaign meeting during the Newbury bypass protests and marvelling at the weirdness of our coalition. In the front row sat the local squirearchy: brigadiers in tweeds and enormous moustaches, titled women in twinsets and headscarves. In the middle were local burghers of all shapes and sizes. At the back sat the scuzziest collection of grunge-skunks I have ever laid eyes on. The audience disagreed about every other subject under the sun – if someone had asked us to decide what day of the week it was, the meeting would have descended into fisticuffs – but everyone there recognised that our quality of life depends on the quality of our surroundings.
The environment is inseperable from social justice. Climate change, for example, is primarily about food and water. It threatens the freshwater supplies required to support human life. As continental interiors dry out and the glaciers feeding many of the rivers used for irrigation disappear, climate change presents the greatest of all threats to the future prospects of the poor. The rich will survive for a few decades at least, as they can use their money to insulate themselves from the effects. The poor are being hammered already.
Sure we are hypocrites. Every one of us, almost by definition. Hypocrisy is the gap between your aspirations and your actions. Greens have high aspirations – they want to live more ethically – and they will always fall short. But the alternative to hypocrisy isn't moral purity (no one manages that) but cynicism.
In reality it is people like Julie Burchell – who is incidentally far richer than almost any green I've met – who treat the poor with contempt. So that she can revel in what she calls “reckless, romantic modernism”, other people must die. But at least you can't accuse her of hypocrisy: she cannot fail to live by her moral code, because she doesn't have one. Give me hypocrisy any day.

Comcast said bandwidth caps would be back before 2019, and now the company's living up to its promise.
The cable provider recently announced that its 1 terabyte bandwidth cap for Xfinity Internet subscribers would start rolling out more broadly. Comcast's data caps are currently in effect in 16 regions with another 18 regions getting the bandwidth cap on November 1. You'll find the complete list of current and upcoming bandwidth cap regions at the bottom of this post.
The company settled on the 1TB cap limit after experimenting with various caps for several years in select areas. During that time, Comcast appeared to be favoring a 300GB cap, but never rolled it out nationwide. Then in April, Comcast bumped up the cap in its test markets to 1 terabyte.
Comcast says only a small minority (less than one percent) of its customers actually use more than one terabyte in a given month. For now, then, the data cap shouldn't be an issue for most people. One terabyte of usage is enough to stream 600 to 700 hours of HD video, play an online game for 500 days straight, or stream 15,000 hours of music, according to Comcast.
Anyone who wants to estimate their data usage can use Comcast's online tool. Xfinity customers can also look at their actual data usage online by logging into their account.
People who approach the limits of the 1TB cap will receive an “in-browser” notification like the one seen here warning of impending overages. If you actually go over the limit, Comcast won't charge you any fees in the first two months of overages over a 12-month period. If there's a third month or more, however, you'll have to pay $10 per extra 50GB of usage, with an upper limit of an extra $200 per month.
The story behind the story: While Comcast's data caps may not be a big deal right now, that could change within a few years due to new technologies. Video streaming is morphing from 1080p HD to 4K streaming, which will require far more data—although the tech industry is working on more efficient compression for video streaming. In addition to streaming video, virtual reality for gaming and other uses may also drive up bandwidth requirements for the years to come. Whether that will push people over the 1TB limit is not yet clear, but it's an issue to keep an eye on in the years ahead.

BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Marchers in a silent protest of Alabama's new immigration law filled 11 city blocks this evening near Linn Park in Downtown Birmingham.The march, organized by faith groups, included no songs or chants, but offered prayers from an imam, priests and a rabbi.Churches and faith-based groups planned the march against Alabama's new law targeting illegal immigrants, calling it a mean-spirited attempt to run an entire group of people out of a state that is still trying to recover from the damage of decades of race-based segregation laws.Both supporters and opponents of the law describe it as the nation's toughest state crackdown on illegal immigration. Protest leaders -- many of whom were from Christian churches -- said the law violates biblical principles and could criminalize basic ministry activities such as providing food, transportation or housing assistance to the needy if the recipient is in the United States illegally.Alabama law enforcement leaders plan to meet next week with officials from the Department of Justice to discuss the state's tough new immigration crackdown.The new law allows officers to detain anyone who cannot prove they are in the country legally during a stop, detention or arrest.The Alabama Sheriffs' Association wants clarification about how long those suspected of being in the country illegally should be detained.Gov. Robert Bentley told WSFA-TV on Friday that he's open to changes in the bill. He said "it is the strongest immigration bill in the country, but we asked for that."

Starting a multi-state distribution brewery usually means a lot of capital, but a growing number of so-called “gypsy” brewers have figured out how to get their products to the public without a million-dollar investment. These itinerant brewmasters rent unused fermentation space from established breweries, where, free from capital constraints, they mix lush and exotic elixirs that push the boundaries of the craft.
This rudderless approach can be controversial. The term “gypsy” itself sometimes offends those of Romani ancestry. And within the craft beer world, itinerant brewers and traditional brick-and-mortars have sparred. More often than not, though, the model is a win-win-win: the brewers create innovative styles, taking risks without the overhead of a physical brewery; the host breweries earn revenue on what would otherwise be unused capacity; and consumers get avant-garde brews that might otherwise never come to market.
Below are five brands that best represent the gypsy-brewing lineage.
Mikkeller

If you've heard of a gypsy brewery, it's likely Mikkeller. Now an international superstar, in 2005 Mikkel Borg Bjergsø was a teacher who teamed up with his friend Kristian Keller to shop their homebrew. Keller left early on, but Mikkel stayed, winning awards and brewing eclectic beers. A decade later, more than 40 countries now import Mikkeller beers. While Mikkeller brews most of its batches at Belgium's de Proef Brouwerij, the company has perfected the art of collaboration. Mikkeller produces beers with some of the most sought-after breweries in the world, including Stone, 3 Floyds, and Hill Farmstead. Try a variation of Beer Geek Breakfast, the coffee-infused oatmeal imperial stout that made Mikkeller famous.
Evil Twin Brewing

Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergsø is literally a twin brewer—his estranged brother is Mikkeller's Mikkel Bjergsø. Jeppe may not actually be evil, but he brews devilishly enticing beers. Owner of a high-end beer retailer in Copenhagen, in 2005, Jeppe began working with Belgium's renowned Cantillon Brewery, collaborating on the ultra-rare Blåbær blueberry lambic. Jeppe has since expanded his empire, creating the Evil Twin label and renting brewery space from friends in the business. Now headquartered in Brooklyn, NY, Jeppe brews Even More Jesus, Imperial Biscotti Break, Hipster Ale and others at nearly a dozen breweries in a half-dozen countries.
Stillwater Artisanal Ales

When brewer Brian Strumke launched Stillwater Artisanal Ales, he vowed to create art in a bottle. That's exactly what he's done. Like many great artists, Strumke combines the familiar and the foreign, blending Belgian yeasts and German-inspired grain bills with unconventional additions like lavender, jasmine, or rose petals. A former techno DJ, Strumke started brewing commercially in Baltimore in 2010. Today, his beers are available in 45 states, Europe, Asia, South America, and Australia. Although he's the sole owner and employee, he collaborates with international brewers (he brewed his Holland Oats with the Dutch brewery Emelisse), and has even concocted multiple collaborations with Mikkeller.
Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project

Owners Dann and Martha Paquette talk about their company not as a brewery but as an exploration: a project with broad guidelines and no definitive end, one that allows for continual discovery and playful invention. The Paquettes explore not through the use of novel ingredients, but by expanding the outer edges of traditional recipes or by resurrecting and reinterpreting long forgotten styles. Pretty Things brews mostly at a single host location, Westport, Massachusset's Buzzards Bay Brewing, although they have made a number of collaborations with other breweries, most notably Boulevard Brewing. Try Jack D'Or, their flagship saison—a dry homage to the classic style with a healthy dose of American bitterness.
Nowhere In Particular
Photo via Nowhere in Particular
The newest brewery on this list, Nowhere In Particular launched Wanderlust, a triple IPA, in 2014. In the months since, brewer Pat Sullivan has created a cult-like following for his big versions of classic styles like Notes from the Underground, a Russian Imperial Stout, or Treasure of the Humble, a Belgian-style strong pale ale. Sullivan creates his concoctions at Cincinnati's Rivertown Brewing Company and at the Motor City's Brew Detroit. Sullivan prefers the term “hobo brewing,” a nod to his own itinerant lifestyle that includes stints as a nationally-ranked telemark skier, a marathon runner, a rock climber, and a ship's captain. NIP's beers are found throughout Ohio and Michigan, with distribution slated soon for other Midwestern states.
Maybe Ghost Rider is coming to Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. after all.
Earlier this month, an Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Comic-Con advertisement on the side of a San Diego light rail showed some fiery chains. Most fans assumed that the fiery chains belonged to Hellfire who's got a long history with Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Skye. After all Hellfire's alter ego James “J.T.” Taylor did make a brief appearance on Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 3. Not only that, but Hellfire does share some roots with the original Ghost Rider.
Most fans ruled out the possibility of Ghost Rider assuming the special effects required would either be too expensive for TV or that Marvel would want to save the character for Netflix where they could take a darker tone than network TV. However, a new casting notice suggests that Ghost Rider might actually be coming to Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D., even though it might not be the one that most fans might expect. Most people know of motorcycle-riding Johnny Blaze Ghost Rider, which is the version Nicolas Cage played in the movies. However, there are other versions of Ghost Rider that have appeared in the comics.
The characters in the casting notice are listed as a pair of Latino brothers. One is classified as "the most dangerous person in the room" and the other is "paralyzed in a wheelchair". If that sounds familiar, it's probably because it bears an eerily close resemblance to Robbie and Gabe Reyes, who starred in the 2014 Marvel NOW! Ghost Rider series. The series, by Felipe Smith and Tradd Moore, was a new take on Ghost Rider focusing on the brotherly bond between its main characters Robbie and Gabe. Robbie has a natural talent for mechanics, but nothing is more important to him than the health of his disabled brother Gabe.

Have you ever looked out into your backyard at night and wondered how many spiders are lurking out there? If you have a flashlight, you can spot them by the creepy green glow of their eyes.
Most spiders have eight eyes. In some species — mostly those that hunt for their prey, like wolf spiders — four of those eyes have a iridescent layer behind their retinas, called a tapetum. It's a common structure in the animal world, especially in animals that have evolved to hunt or forage at night, like cats, dogs, deer, lemurs, raccoon, and even some bird species.
Advertisement
When light shines into the eye, it reflects off the tapetum and back onto the retina. More light hitting the retina means that the animal can get the most out of every photon, improving its ability to see in the dark. The reflected light also creates what's called “eyeshine,” which is why cats' eyes seem to glow in the dark.
It's also why you can see spiders' eyes glowing bright green in the night, if you know how to look: light reflects off their tapeta, and they're looking in your direction. Enjoy thinking about that.
Follow the Eyeshine
Advertisement
I caught this one myself.
The Boy Scouts have taught this trick for years; they call it “spider sniffing,” but professional biologists also use it to find and study spiders that hunt at night. Here's how it works:
Hold a flashlight level with your eyes. You'll look a little silly doing this, but it means the light will reflect from the spiders' eyes at an easier angle for you to spot. Sweep the light across the grass about 15 or 20 feet away. If you see a bright point of eerie green light, that's your flashlight beam reflecting off a spider's eyes. Feel free to walk over and check it out; you'll probably be surprised at how bright the eyeshine from even a tiny spider can be.

In most of North America, you'll probably find mostly wolf spiders, whose venom isn't dangerous to humans, but you should still be careful. You may also see some red reflections out there in the dark; they're probably June bugs or moths.
This one's just minding its business, not staring at you at all, honest. Image: Wikimedia Commons

Looking at You?
Hi, there! Image: Wikimedia Commons
Spiders have eight eyes, but they don't actually see that well. Wolf spiders have the second-best vision in the class Arachnida, after jumping spiders — but even jumping spiders see only about as well as cats. Although cats have excellent night vision, and they're great at seeing even the slightest motion, their vision isn't actually very sharp. The world looks brighter, but blurrier, to a cat or a jumping spider.
Advertisement
The world looks even blurrier to a wolf spider. To find prey and dodge predators, they rely more on their ability to sense vibrations. That means, of course, that they still know exactly where you are. Especially the one on your shoulder.

By Eugene Robinson - February 15, 2013
WASHINGTON -- In his bid to be remembered as a transformational leader, President Obama is following the playbook of an ideological opposite, Margaret Thatcher. First you win the argument, she used to say, then you win the vote.
Obama is gradually winning the argument about what government can and should do. His State of the Union address was an announcement of that fact -- and a warning to conservatives that to remain relevant, they will have to move beyond the premise that government is always the problem and never the solution.
It's ridiculous for critics to charge that Tuesday night's speech was not sufficiently bipartisan. Repairing the nation's infrastructure is not a partisan issue; bridges rust at the same rate in Republican-held congressional districts as in Democratic ones. The benefits of universal preschool will accrue in red states as well as blue. Climate change is not deterred by the fact that a majority of the Republican caucus in the House doesn't believe in it.
There is no bipartisan compromise between "do something" and "do nothing." Obama's re-election reflected the progress he has made in convincing Americans that "do something" is the only option -- and that "do nothing" leads inexorably to decline.
Thatcher's reshaping of British politics and governance is instructive. The Iron Lady came to power at a time when Britain was sinking. The ideological pendulum had swung too far to the left, and the nominally socialist Labor Party, architect of the modern British welfare state, was out of ideas. Thatcher's Conservative government roused the nation from its torpor. She was an enormously polarizing figure, and much of what she did -- fighting the unions, privatizing state industries and public housing -- was met with bitter resistance.
Today, Britain remains one of the wealthiest countries in the world and continues to play a major role in international affairs. London is arguably the world's pre-eminent financial center. I doubt any of this would be the case if Thatcher had not won the argument about how her nation should move forward.
When Obama took office, the United States was in a similar funk. Ronald Reagan's conservative ideas had been corrupted by his followers into a kind of anti-government nihilism. Reagan wanted to shrink government; today's Republican Party wants to destroy it.
Obama assumed leadership of a country in which inequality was growing and economic mobility declining, with the result that the American dream was becoming less attainable. It was a country whose primary and secondary schools lagged far behind international norms; whose airports, roads and bridges were showing their age; and, most important, whose path to continued prosperity, in the age of globalization and information technology, was not entirely clear.
Obama's State of the Union speech was a detailed reiteration of his position that we can and must act to secure our future -- and that government can and must be one of our principal instruments.
To understand why Americans re-elected Obama in November and sent more Democrats to both houses of Congress, consider the Republican response delivered by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., following the president's address.
Never mind the unforgettable moment when Rubio stooped almost out of sight and reached for a bottle of water, all the while trying to look straight ahead at the camera like John Cleese in some Monty Python sketch. I felt genuinely sorry for him -- and appalled at the Republican Party's incompetence at basic stagecraft. First they give Clint Eastwood an empty chair to perform with at the convention, and now this?
Even more unfortunate, in the end, was the utter lack of ideas in Rubio's speech.
"More government isn't going to help you get ahead, it's going to hold you back," Rubio said. Yet he also said that he never would have been able to go to college without government-backed student loans. And he spoke touchingly of how Medicare paid for the care his father received in his final days and the care his mother needs now.
I expected him to try to reconcile this contradiction. Instead, he went back to portraying government as something to be tamed rather than something to be used. To a majority of Republican primary voters, this makes sense. To the electorate as a whole, it might have made sense 30 years ago -- but not today.
Margaret Thatcher never won the hearts of her many opponents. But by winning her, argument she shaped a nation's future. There's an increasing chance that historians will say the same of Barack Obama.
Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said Saturday that he expects President Trump to win with 400 electoral votes in the 2020 election.
Speaking at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C., one day after Trump spoke at the event, Bannon predicted that there is more in store for his former boss than just completing his first term in office.
Trump is going to "win with 400 electoral votes in 2020," Bannon said.

That would be nearly 100 more votes in the Electoral College that Trump received in 2016, when he got 304 votes versus Hillary Clinton's 227 votes.
His comment Saturday stands in contrast to a recent Vanity Fair report in which a source said Bannon told people that Trump only has a 30 percent chance of making it through the full term. Several Democrats have rallied around the idea of impeaching Trump, though it's unlikely to make much headway with a Republican-controlled Congress.
Over the course of his speech, Bannon, who is back at Breitbart News, touted his successful campaign to get judge Roy Moore to beat Trump's preferred candidate, Sen. Luther Strange, in the Alabama run-off contest last month.
Still, Bannon rallied those in attendance to not turn their backs on Trump.
"The president needs our support more than ever," he said.
He also threatened members of the Republican establishment, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and dissed those who have not denounced Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who has recently has a war of words with Trump.
The murder of Seth Rich has taken a strange twist after a private investigator working for the Rich family claiming that the slain DNC staffer may have leaked the organization's emails to WikiLeaks — a charge that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appears to be endorsing.
Rich was shot to death in Washington, D.C., last summer in a case that remains unsolved. While police said that his murder was a robbery gone wrong in a neighborhood that had seen a spate of armed robberies, some conspiracy theorists believed that the young Democratic National Committee employee was really killed in retribution for leaking the organization's emails to WikiLeaks. The organization published them over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign, which turned out to be politically damaging to Hillary Clinton.
Now that theory may have some new backing. Rod Wheeler, a private investigator and former Washington investigator, said he believes there is evidence on a laptop used by Seth Rich that he was in contact with WikiLeaks before his death. Wheeler also implied that Washington, D.C., police were stonewalling the investigation.
“The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,” Wheeler told Fox 5 in Washington. “They haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.”

Wheeler told the outlet that he had a source confirming that Seth Rich was in contact with WikiLeaks and also said that police were trying to thwart the investigation into his death.
“I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, ‘Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can't share any information with you.' Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department,” he said. “Again, I don't think it comes from the chief's office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].”
To add even more intrigue to the story, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange retweeted the story from the Fox 5 Twitter account about Wheeler's allegations. Julian Assange claims that Russia was not the Wikileaks source in DNC email leaks. [Image by Markus Schreiber/AP Images, File]
To many, this seemed to be an endorsement of the theory that Seth Rich was the one who leaked the DNC emails, and it is not the first time that the WikiLeaks founder has hinted at Seth Rich being a source. In an appearance on a Dutch television show (via a transcript published in The Gateway Pundit), Assange suggested that Seth Rich was a “source” for WikiLeaks.
Julian Assange: “Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27-year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.”
Reporter: “That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn't it?”
Julian Assange: “No. There's no finding. So… I'm suggesting that our sources take risks.”
null
The latest story seems to contradict statements from the D.C. police on Seth Rich's murder. In the summer, the Metropolitan Police Department told Business Insider that there was “no indication” that Rich's death was the result of his work at the DNC or being an alleged whistleblower. There have also been widespread reports both from IT investigators and U.S. intelligence agencies that the DNC emails were hacked as part of the Russian campaign to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.
There will likely be more of the story to come. Rod Wheeler said he will release more information about the murder of Seth Rich and his apparent connections to WikiLeaks.

Two matches stand out in this weekend's Top 14 programme – the Paris derby between Stade Francais and Racing Metro, and Toulouse's trip to Toulon.
With the end of the Top 14 season nigh, and European action looming for the likes of Clermont, Toulon, Toulouse, Stade Francais and Brive, this week's matches take on extra importance.
There are more than bragging rights at stake in the Paris derby at Stade Jean Bouin. Stade could severely damage Racing's hopes of a place in the end-of-season play-offs.
The big-spending visitors are sweating on the fitness of hooker Dimitri Szarzewski, flanker Jacques Cronje and centre Jamie Roberts – and no wonder. Time is fast running out and they are currently seventh in the table, one point outside the play-off places. And with Europe off their radar, they will want to throw everything they have at the Top 14.
Stade has just two points more, and are currently fifth. Just three matches remain after this week's Top 14 programme.
But – and it's a big but – at this stage in the season, points in the bag are more valuable than points in potentia. Stade have home advantage. They haven't lost at home all season. They're surely not about to start now, not against their rivals from Colombes. Defeat won't kill off Racing's hopes of the play-offs, but it will make things much more tense, especially with matches against Clermont and Montpellier to come in their run-in.
The two big pieces of news out of Toulon this week are:
1) The worst-kept secret in town about Jonny Wilkinson's widely expected impending retirement at the end of the season
2) Bernard Laporte will challenge his 16-week suspension, after it was extended by three weeks when he appealed against the initially imposed 13-week suspension for comments made after the defeat by Grenoble at Stade Mayol
Neither of which are particularly enlightening when considering the more immediate question of the visit of Toulouse on Saturday, other than as a possibly partially distracting sidenote to the game.
All is pretty quiet – as it usually is – on the Toulouse front. The only question is, at this stage in the season, with a Heineken Cup trip to Munster looming on their horizon, how much is left in the visitors' locker… especially after last week's astonishing match at Stade Francais?
The weekend's rugby kicks off on Friday night as two more Top 14 teams with Europe on their minds meet at Stade Amedee Domenech. Brive, who head to Bath for an Amlin Cup clash next weekend entertain Clermont, a week ahead of their Heineken Cup match against Leicester at Marcel Michelin.
The hosts' Top 14 play-off hopes were all-but destroyed in last weekend's 38-6 defeat at defending champions Castres. Worse for the Brivistes, two of their key players, Damien Neveu and Dominiko Waqaniburotu, have been suspended for two weeks after picking up red cards during the bad-tempered encounter at Stade Pierre Antoine.
Clermont, meanwhile, are on a high after last weekend's hard-fought victory over Toulon at home – their 74th win in a row at Marcel Michelin. And they welcome back hooker Benjamin Kayser and centre Wesley Fofana after injury. But Brive don't lose many at home – just once this season, and that was against Biarritz. Even a weakened Brive won't be easy to beat in the hostile surroundings of Amedee Domenech, and Clermont may well have one eye on next week's Heineken Cup match.
Top 14 champions Castres head to Biarritz without two influential forwards. Like the two Brive players prop Yannick Forestier also saw red in last week's game at Stade Pierre Antoine, while man mountain Karena Wihongi tore a hamstring early in the same game and will could be out for the rest of the season.
The Tarn side, however, will have the pick of the rest of their internationals – who have been promised a holiday during the following European week. That means Brice Dulin, Antonie Claassen, Remi Tales, Richie Gray, Max Evans and Brice Mach could all play.
The pressure is off Biarritz now. They have no chance of surviving the drop. Which could make them a more dangerous animal now than when they had even the slimmest of hopes. Castres are fourth in the table, but a shock defeat at the home of the Top 14's basement club would leave them looking nervously over their shoulders.
Bordeaux would do their play-off hopes no harm at all with a victory at home against Perpignan. Until last week's win over Biarritz at Aime Giral, the Catalans' season – which had started reasonably well – was going from bad to worse via awful. They need to keep picking up points, and their best chance of doing that is courtesy of the boot of James Hook. Don't expect much in the way of adventure from the visitors as they aim to at least keep in touch with their hosts.
Grenoble's play-off hopes are as good as dead in the groundwater that lies just beneath the surface of Stade des Alpes. They should recognise similar conditions at Oyonnax's Stade Charles Mathon, where the stormy winter hasn't been kind to the soil either.
Fourteen players are set to leave the Isere side at the end of the season. More pressingly, Peter Kimlin – who's not among the 14 – and Vincent Campo and Blair Stewart – who are – are injured. This could be the break that the forever-perky Oyonnax side need as they fight tooth and nail not to become the second side relegated from the Top 14. Sadly, even a win this weekend will probably be too little too late…
… Unless, that is Montpellier can do them a big – if expected favour. They're at home to 12th-placed Bayonne, who are five points ahead of the side from the plastics city. Fabien Galthie's team welcome back Nicolas Mas from injury and, with a play-off berth in their grasp, they'll be out to claim all the points they can.
And a big home win at Yves du Manoir would do Oyonnax's cause no harm whatsoever.

(Image: Accounting panic via ShutterstocThe establishment types in Washington have become really worried in recent weeks because one of their major troughs, the Export-Import Bank, may not be reauthorized by Congress. The Ex-Im Bank has long been a favored source of below market loans for Boeing, General Electric, and other major companies. If these companies have to pay market interest rates on their loans, it will cost them tens of billions of dollars in profits over the next decade.
The problem became serious after Republican majority leader Eric Cantor's surprise defeat in a Republican primary. As a close ally of big business, Cantor could be counted on to push through re-authorization of the Bank before the September 30 deadline for the current authorization. However his replacement as majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, is more likely to give in to Tea Party demands to end this subsidy to big business.
This prospect prompted the most hysteria among the Washington elite since the financial crisis threatened to lay waste to Wall Street following the collapse of Lehman. As we know, when major companies have their profits on the line, the pundits get worried and truth goes flying out the window.
We had panicked pieces pressing the urgency of reauthorization from ordinarily level-headed columnists like Joe Nocera and Neil Irwin, the latter of whom told us, “we are all crony capitalists.” They warned us that our exports will collapse without the subsidies provided by the bank.
Even my friend Paul Krugman got into the act, arguing for re-authorization of the bank on the more honest grounds that any spending in the current economy will create jobs and boost growth. This is true, but the same argument could justify appropriating billions to pay people to dig holes and fill them up again, since in a time of mass unemployment even paying people to do pointless tasks will create jobs.
The basic story is a simple one. The Ex-Im bank subsidizes politically connected firms by providing them with below market loans. This can boost exports, but the bank also subsidizes imports, leaving its direct impact on the trade balance uncertain. As any graduate of Econ 101 knows, the subsidies provided by the bank effectively raise the cost of capital to other firms. When the higher interest rates paid by less well connected firms are factored in the bank would likely be a net loser of jobs and detriment to growth.
If you need to be convinced of this point, suppose that we had a government policy of just providing a flat subsidy of 10 percent to selected exporters. No economist would argue that in normal times (not the depressed economy we see now) such a subsidy would lead to additional jobs and growth. The Ex-Im Bank is such a subsidy, but it takes the form of a loan at below market interest rates, nonetheless it amounts to the same thing and everyone with any background in economics knows it.
But the best part of the debate is the silly stuff that serious people have to say to promote the bank. Perhaps the best line in this category is that 80 percent of the loans supported by the bank are for small businesses. We should have great sympathy for any political figure/policy type who is forced to say this line since they know it is complete garbage.
What matters is the percent of the money, not the percent of the loans. If the bank backs $80 billion in loans for Boeing, General Electric, or Enron (a favorite in past days), and $20 billion for small businesses, it doesn't matter that the $20 billion in small business loans accounted for the bulk of the transactions. Most of the money went to big businesses. That is what matters and everyone touting the share of small business loans knows it.
The other area for fun accounting is the claim that we make money on the bank. This is true in a literal sense, but not in a way that any economist/policy type would take seriously under other circumstances. The federal government is one of the lowest cost borrowers in the world. By splitting the difference between the cost of borrowing to the federal government and the cost to private companies, the government can virtually always guarantee itself a profit.
This is a simple and widely understood form of arbitrage. The government could also make money by lending billions of dollars to Dean Baker's Brilliant Hedge Fund, which would invest in a broad stock index and pay the government an interest rate 0.25 percentage points more than its borrowing costs.
Needless to say, the Ex-Im supporters will not back loans to Dean Baker's Brilliant Hedge Fund, even though the profit to the government would be as assured as with the Ex-Im Bank. The point is that it would be allocating capital in ways that serve no obvious economic purpose and likely are worse than the market allocation.
This was essentially the same story as the widely touted profit on TARP and related Fed lending. In the middle of a financial crisis, we made vast amounts of money available to favored banks at far below market interest rates. Since the lending pit was essentially bottomless — there would be no more Lehmans in the words of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — it was pretty much in evitable that the banks would survive and the money would be repaid. But the end of the story is that the otherwise bankrupt Wall Street bankers are rich, and the rest of the economy is still in recession.
Anyhow, the Ex-Im battle is a brief foray back into TARP land. There is much less at stake in this one, but it is still striking to see how the establishment types are willing to throw out all their rules and principles in order to secure re-authorization. Given their power, they will almost certainly win, but the rest of us should at least enjoy the show.
Casey Heynes has captivated the world's attention with the video of him standing up to a bully and laying the smackdown. As some news reports analyze the consequences of the fight, one news show in Australia went right to Casey to get his inspirational story.
Casey provides play-by-play commentary for his bully confrontation and admits that he wasn't really thinking. The interview reveals that Casey suffered from a “lifetime of torment and abuse” and was all alone since his friends had deserted him. Casey sadly spoke about how he could only remember a couple of days when nobody would tease him, and that he even contemplated suicide. Finally though, as documented in the now famous clip, Casey just reached a point where enough was enough and snapped.
Casey has no regrets about the incident, but even more importantly, has a profound message for bullying victims around the world: “look for the good days, keep your chin up and school ain't going to last forever.” And with Casey's international popularity, and hundreds of thousands of supporters through social media, Casey is likely to have many more very good days in the future.

George W. Bush is the second Republican president in a row, after his father, to leave office breaking a promise; a fairytale.
During his nomination acceptance speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention, President George H.W. Bush famously thundered, "Read my lips, no new taxes."
Then Governor Bill Clinton turned the words against Bush in an unforgettable attack ad that set Clinton on a sure path to victory, entitled, "The George Bush Promise."
The ad featured Bush making his memorable "no new taxes" declaration over a swell of foreboding music, followed by an enduring voiceover that all but destroyed the president's character and credibility in less than 18 seconds: "Then [President Bush] gave us the second biggest tax increase in American history," the voiceover says, "Bush increased the gas tax by 56 percent."
- Advertisement -
Unfortunately, the ad created a fallout that was limited in its scope to the political career of President Bush. Democrats missed an opportunity to draw broader lessons; to connect the necessity for that tax increase to the effects of Reagan's tax cuts and deficit spending on defense; ultimately, to expose the inherent shortcomings of a political philosophy that encourages selfishness.
The Republican Party philosophy is that of the grasshopper in Aesop's fable, "The Ant and the Grasshopper." The reader will remember how the grasshopper wastes his summer days singing and chirping "to its heart's content," while the ant toils, stocking provisions of wheat and corn for the winter. (Right now, that ant is China). When winter arrives, the ants live merrily and the grasshopper freezes and starves to death.
In the 1934 Walt Disney version, released in the midst of the last great American economic disaster, the grasshopper (blue with cold) is allowed inside and given a tub of warm water in which to place his feet and a bowl of soup. He survives.
- Advertisement -
(A dozen or so other pundits and columnists have used the old fable as an analogy in the last month.)
The Chief Grasshopper in 2008 finds himself in the stormy and brisk winds of October as he enters his last 100 days in the White House. America has $10 trillion of debt.
For eight years, President Bush has said, "Read my lips, no nationalized anything," preaching instead the doctrine of selfishness and market-centered greed in every sector.
"We need," Bush said on January 28, 2004, "to keep...the private market strong [read: keep the rich getting richer], by resisting efforts that are happening in Washington, D.C., to say the federal government should be running health care...I believe the best health care system is that health care system generated in the private markets."
In reality, we have a costly health care system, adding to our national debt. America pays nearly twice as much per capita as Switzerland, who has the second most expensive health care system in the world.
In fact, in 2004 our health care system cost $6,000 per capita--its even more expensive today. By contrast, the recent $700 billion bailout cost every American $2,000. Our health care system costs the equivalent of a $2.1 trillion bailout EVERY YEAR.

Grasshopper Bush wants you to keep singing and chirping because that annual $2.1 trillion is flowing into the pockets of the insurers and the care providers, never to be seen again. We'll pick up the tab.

BOSTON (AP) — The owners of Boston's first-ever medical marijuana dispensary are predicting a small turnout for the facility's milestone opening.
Executives at Patriot Care were hard at work Tuesday night preparing for Wednesday's grand opening, which is expected to draw just a few dozen customers with state-issued medical marijuana cards.
Even before the doors of the Milk Street store have opened, Patriot Care already has lined up more than 200 patients preregistered to shop in the dispensary. Company officials say they are prepared to handle at least 150 customers each day at the location.
Chief Executive Robert Mayerson says he's proud that Patriot Care is taking a space that has been dormant for 10 years and bringing economic vitality back to it.

The dispensary is the seventh to open in Massachusetts.
You think that loose change you see on the ground from day to day isn't worth anything? Think again.
A Manatee County man is proving those abandoned pennies you see from time to time are really worth something.
“I'd like to thank the many who are too lazy to pick up a penny,” said Rick Snyder.
Snyder said he picks up the coins that others leave behind. He said he started doing this year's ago, while out caring for feral cats around the area.
“I feed feral cats,” said Snyder. “I've been doing it a long time. As I was out feeding the cats at the various places I feed them, I would see money laying around. Of course I'd pick it up and I started thinking I should keep track of this.”
Snyder said he became obsessed with how much he could collect. He said on average, he finds, about $5 and 60 cents a day.
Fast forward that 10 years later, and he now has a big chunk of change.
“$10,000 was my first goal and then I hit that and I wasn't satisfied, said Snyder. “I said I'd keep going so I got to 100-jars and thought well I'll keep going. $20,000 was my next goal and I exceeded that.”
Rick said he collected around $21,494. But instead of keeping it for himself, he gave it all away.
The man who is passionate about helping cats and finding money is also passionate about helping others.
On Tuesday, he donated the money to the Gulf Shore Animal League, a non-profit organization that helps stray and feral cats in the community.
“This is just over the top,” said Cheryl Wade, President of the Gulf Shore Animal League. “It will help so many animals in our community.”
Wade said they'll use the money to fund their trap and neuter program to end over population and homelessness of cats.
They will also use it to help care for the kittens who are too young to be adopted. Snyder said he isn't finished.
He's already started collecting more change and plans to donate what he finds again in the future.
Anyone wondering why the inmates at America's prison camp in the Caribbean are starving themselves to death need look no further than this story from NBC News: “The Pentagon is considering plans for a $150 million overhaul of the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — including building a new dining hall, hospital and barracks for the guards — as part of an ambitious project recommended by the top general in charge of its operations.”
In other words, despite campaign promises and an executive order from President Barack Obama — not to mention budget sequestration — Gitmo isn't going away.
With an operating budget of $177 million to house just 166 detainees, Guantanamo is already costing taxpayers more than $1 million per prisoner annually, making it “the country's most expensive prison per capita by far,” according to NBC.
Now the Defense Department is seeking almost as much again to upgrade the camp: nearly $100 million for new barracks for the 848 guards (more than five per prisoner), $12 million for a dining hall for the troops, $11.2 million for a hospital and medical unit for detainees, $9.9 million for a complex where detainees can meet with their lawyers, and $10.8 million for a “communications network facility” to store data. The camp is already getting a $40 million boost in the form of a fiber optic cable being laid from southern Florida to Guantanamo “to improve Internet access, thereby allowing officials to have improved live video feeds of the military commission proceedings of the Sept. 11 hijackers,” NBC reported.
With the sequester putting the squeeze on federal budgets, one might think the last place the Obama administration would want to spend more money is on a prison camp that the president has pledged to close and where, Gen. John Kelly, commander of the U.S. Southern Command, told the House Armed Services Committee, “everything … is at least twice as expensive” as it is back in the United States.
“Gitmo seems to be the one place they don't care about spending money,” David Remes, a defense attorney who represents detainees, told NBC. “They will spare no expense to keep these men there rather than bring them to the United States.”
The detainees can see this quite clearly.
“They had great optimism that Guantanamo would be closed,” Kelly told the House panel. “They were devastated, apparently … when the president backed off — at least their perception — of closing the facility.”
Kelly added that Obama “said nothing about it in his inauguration speech. He said nothing about it in his State of the Union speech. He has said nothing about it. He's not — he's not restaffing the office that … looks at closing the facility.”
In January, Special Envoy Dan Fried, charged with finding new homes for the detainees, was notified that he was being reassigned and his office was being abolished. “In closing the special envoy position and transferring its portfolio to a State Department legal department ill-equipped to handle it, Obama has sent a clear message that he intends to maintain the present situation at the prison indefinitely,” observed Murtaza Hussain of the Guardian.
That present situation, notes the Future of Freedom Foundation's Andy Worthington, is such that “almost everyone still held at Guantanamo is being detained indefinitely without charge or trial.”
Over half the detainees were cleared for release by a task force Obama personally established in 2009; but when the “underwear bomber,” a Nigerian recruited in Yemen, attempted to blow up an airplane in December of that year, Obama issued an executive order banning the release of any Yemeni prisoners. “That,” Worthington points out, “is in spite of the fact that two-thirds of the men the president's own task force recommended for release are Yemenis, and even though continuing to hold them constitutes imprisonment by nationality alone.”
Congress shares in the blame for the continued detention of the remaining men. The 2013 National Defense Authorization Act essentially forbids the closure of Guantanamo and the transfer of its prisoners, tying the president's hands in that regard. However, Obama signed the bill into law knowing full well that this was the case, so he cannot claim to be an innocent bystander in all of this.
Just knowing they are most likely stuck in Gitmo for the rest of their lives would be enough to drive the detainees to despair. Compounding matters is that in recent months, prisoners have also been subjected to considerably worse treatment, according to Hussain:
Earlier this year, it was revealed that a detainee was shot in the neck by a guard, the first incident of gunfire known to have occurred in the camp's history. In addition to a pervasive atmosphere of violence at the facility — characterized by beatings and other forms of abuse by camp guards — detainees have increasingly had their meager personal effects confiscated or damaged, without cause or explanation. Mundane items such as family photos, letters and CDs have recently been taken away by camp guards and prisoners['] copies of the Qur'an have been desecrated under the guise of searching for contraband.
Having few options to protest their inhumane imprisonment, and figuring they are likely to die in Guantanamo anyway, the detainees have resorted to a hunger strike. The Obama administration at first denied that any such strike was taking place, but as of last week it had admitted that 25 men were on strike. Detainees' lawyers say that the number tops 100 and that many of the strikers are in rapidly deteriorating health as a result of their malnourishment. NBC reports that eight of them are being force-fed through tubes, which Hussain writes is “an excruciatingly painful procedure that the UN Human Rights Commission has said it considers to be torture.” (The Obama administration, like its predecessor, has refused to allow the UN's torture investigators access to Guantanamo prisoners — an admirable stand for U.S. sovereignty, perhaps, but given the administration's deference to international bodies in other matters, one that suggests a coverup.)
Absent a significant shift in U.S. policy, it seems likely that many of the prisoners will end up seriously debilitated or dead from lack of food. That might save taxpayers some money, but those savings would come at the cost of our historical commitment to “liberty and justice for all.”
Obama seemed to understand this in 2008, and there is still time for him to rediscover it. While he couldn't force Congress to change the law to allow for the release of the prisoners, he could at least put the same type of effort into making it happen that he put into getting, say, the Affordable Care Act passed.
“This is something that really calls for leadership from the president — he needs to decide if he wants Guantanamo to be part of his legacy,” Omar Farah, staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told Inter Press Service. “If the U.S. isn't willing to charge someone in a fair process and can't produce proper evidence of their crimes, then those prisoners have to be released. There is just no other way to have a democratic system. We've never had this kind of alternative system of justice, and yet that's what we have in Guantanamo.”

Gaithersburg, Maryland – A high-ranking NIST officer was recently forced to resign after creating an explosion inside of a government lab while attempting to manufacture methamphetamine.
According to NBC News, the explosion happened at the Gaithersburg, Md. campus of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, around 7:30 PM on Saturday.
An officer on the scene, who has not been named by police, was reportedly found with severe burns on his hands and arms, implicating him in the explosion.
Additionally, supplies were found on the scene that are typically associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine. When they arrived, police reportedly found pseudoephedrine, drain opener and even a recipe for methamphetamine.
Witnesses told police that after the explosion, the officer was seen throwing something in the trash and then running to his car to hide a duffle bag. The officer then attempted to tell police that he accidentally burned himself with a lighter.
“We are looking at the possibility that this was some sort of chemical reaction due to the manufacturing of drugs,” Montgomery County Police Capt. Paul Starks said.
Although the officer was forced to resign from his post at NIST, no arrests were made.

Published on January 23rd, 2015
(January 23, 2015) – Team Vestas Wind today announced that navigator Wouter Verbraak is no longer a member of the crew for the Volvo Ocean Race. The Dutchman was on board when the team was run aground on November 29 during Leg 2 on a reef in the middle of the Indian Ocean, causing major damage.
In the same announcement, Team Vestas Wind also stated that the remaining members of the crew would continue helping the team with the boat repair process at Persico's boatyard in Italy before their planned return to the race in June for the final two legs from Lisbon under skipper Chris Nicholson.
A statement issued early on Friday said: “Chris Nicholson has completed his review, together with the lead sponsor Vestas and sub-sponsor Powerhouse, and the decision has been made that Wouter Verbraak will no longer continue as navigator of the Vestas Wind.
“Team Vestas Wind will be joined by a new navigator in time for the Lisbon stopover and Leg 8 start in June. Team Vestas Wind would like to thank Wouter for his service and wish him well in the future.”
Verbraak, in a statement, added: “I am very sad to announce that I have been notified that I will not continue with Team Vestas Wind.
“I respect Chris Nicholson's decision and wish the team the very, very best of luck with the hard work ahead of them in the Volvo Ocean Race. I would have wanted to help the team getting back in the race again and contribute to their success in the last parts of the race.
“On a personal note I am looking forward to the new sailing challenges that are coming up for me in the months ahead and want to keep sharing the passion that I have for this great sport with you all.
“Someone recently told me: ‘Life is not about how many breaths you take, but about the moments that take your breath away'. I am looking forward to the new breathless moments to come. Ocean racing tends to offer many of them.”
The remaining shore and sailing crew will continue to work as integral members of Team Vestas Wind, and will use their skills to assist Persico in the boat repair process.
They will also support the team at stopovers before Lisbon to keep Team Vestas Wind at the centre of race activities. The crew were grounded on a reef near St Brandon archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The boat was badly damaged but was retrieved just before Christmas.
It is expected to arrive on a Maersk Line ship in Genoa, Italy on Sunday and then be transported with the help of race sponsors GAC Pindar to Persico's boatyard in Bergamo for the rebuild to start in earnest.
Background: The 2014-15 Volvo Ocean Race began in Alicante, Spain on Oct. 11 with the final finish on June 27 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Racing the new one design Volvo Ocean 65, seven teams will be scoring points in 9 offshore legs to determine the overall Volvo Ocean Race winner. Additionally, the teams will compete in 10 In-Port races at each stopover for a separate competition – the Volvo Ocean Race In-Port Series. Race website: http://www.volvooceanrace.com/en/home.html

Car Vs. Cyclist
Listen to this 'Talk of the Nation' topic Listen
This may be terribly un-NPR of me, but I just can't bike to work. D.C. is a tough city to navigate under any circumstance, and even after 7 years here, I just can't get my head around doing so on two wheels. I've seen too many bus drivers fail to notice cyclists, too many cars in designated bike lanes, and too many accidents at the intersection right outside my window. But, as I'm sure is true for many, my feelings about bicyclers are complicated. While, ideologically, my sympathies lie mostly with them, there are few words adequate to describe the rage I feel when "Share the Road"-ers blatantly disregard the rules of said road, riding opposite traffic, through red lights, and on what I adamantly assert (in my head, anyway) are sidewalks. No group in this scenario -- walkers, drivers, cyclists -- is blameless, and I think we all make a lot of assumptions. For example, I always assumed the cyclists were doing something, intentionally or not, that's pretty good for the environment. You know what? Even that rationale's got some doubters. But with gas prices still insane (that's a technical term), it'd be pretty hard to argue that cycling doesn't make economic sense for the rider, even if it doesn't in the big picture. So as the numbers of two-wheelers grow, so does the interest in making our cities more bike-friendly for commuters. Where do you stand -- or sit -- in the intersection of cars, bikes, and walkers... or of fuel economy, safety, and the environment?
Taipei, Jan. 11 (CNA) The long-delayed mass rapid transit (MRT) line between Taipei and Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport will begin trial runs after the Lunar New Year but before the Lantern Festival on Feb. 11, Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan (鄭文燦) said Wednesday.
While Transport Minister Ho Chen Tan (賀陳旦) expressed optimism last year that the trial runs could take place before the Lunar New Year holiday in late January, Cheng said the line will not be able to get an operation permit from the ministry in time because the system is still being improved after a final inspection earlier this month.
Cheng said the line will get the permit near the Lunar New Year and will start trial runs by the Lantern Festival -- the 15th day of the first month on the lunar calendar.
Group passengers who apply in advance will be allowed to travel free between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. in the first two weeks of the one-month trial period, he said.
In the last two weeks of the trial period, travel will be free for all individual passengers on the line, which will run between Taipei and the airport, Cheng said.
The system will impose capacity controls during the period, with a maximum of 10,000 passengers allowed to travel each day, he said.
Passengers are also reminded that there will be no early check-in services available during the trial runs at the MRT Taipei Main Station.
After the one-month trial, commercial operations will start, with a 50 percent discount on all trips during the first month, he said.
"The system will make airport traffic much smoother and will connect Taipei, New Taipei and Taoyuan, as well as attracting investment," Cheng said in a press conference, adding that more details about the trial runs will be disclosed next week.
Showcasing MRT merchandise and a brochure that will be available in Mandarin Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean, Cheng also said that the trains will be user-friendly for those traveling with digital devices, with free WiFi and wireless charging services in all the carriages, he said.
The 51.03-kilometer line, which took 12 years to complete, will serve more than 20 stations from Taipei to Taoyuan, including 14 from Taipei Main Station to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.
It will take about 36 minutes to travel between Taipei Main Station and the airport, according to the Taoyuan Metro Corp.

Mycologists nowadays spend too much time writing grant proposals and not enough time lifting up logs. The latter occupation strikes me as so interesting that I can hardly pass a log without wanting to lift it up. And upon lifting up a log, I've occasionally found a cyphelloid species called Henningsomyces candidus.
A word about cyphelloid fungi. Their cup or disc-shaped fruiting bodies suggest that they're discomycetes, but they're really basidiomycetes or, in the words of mycologist Ian Gibson, “basidiomycete cup fungi.” DNA researchers sometimes refer to them as “reduced agarics,” and reduced they certainly are — most fruiting bodies are no more than a few millimeters in diameter. Yet as if to compensate for their small size, they usually fruit in swarms.
Henningsomyces candidus is so small (1-2 fruiting bodies per mm) that it might be confused with a generic white crust fungus. But get out your hand lens, and you'll see an array of tubular fruiting bodies with apical pores that resemble sea squirts gone terrestrial. Or perhaps clusters of miniature macaroni. A friend in New Brunswick was even more specific — she compared the fruiting bodies to ziti. With a microscope, you'll see that each “ziti” (zitum?) has dichophytic hairs around the margin that resemble branches on a tree. You'll also see fusiform cystidioles, 2 or 4 sterigmate basidia, and subglobose or slightly elliptical spores. If the spores are more than slightly elliptical, you've probably peering at a similar species, the scatologically-named Rectipilus fasciculatus, which — MycoKey to the contrary — is not in synonymy with H. candidus.
In the Eastern U.S., H. candidus can be found under hardwood logs (or under the bark of rotting birch logs) as well as under the occasional softwood log, while in the West it commonly grows on ponderosa pine. I usually find it in the spring or early summer rather than in the fall. There are good Henningsomyces years and bad ones. 2011 happens to be a banner Henningsomyces year: between April and early July, I've found specimens in Cambridge (MA), on the summit of Mt. Graylock (western MA), near Duluth (MN), and in several different parts of New Brunswick. So start lifting up logs, for the Henningsomyces mycelium might have exhausted itself this year, and you won't find any specimens at all next year…
Lawrence Millman is the author of the new guidebook Fascinating Fungi of New England (Kollath & Stensaas), which, in addition to a well-rounded cast of big tasty mushrooms, contains many odd and unusual species like the one he describes above. It is written in a charming, convivial style and very beautifully illustrated.

David Lean's magnificent and sensual 1962 epic is back at London's BFI Southbank in a 70mm print. Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson's terrifically bold adaptation of TE Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom is a movie with all the sweep and antique confidence of a cavalry charge.
Lean demonstrated a mastery of storytelling structure, scale, perspective-shifting, the intense closeup moment, the colossal widescreen panorama – epitomised by the film's most famous coup de cinéma: having accepted his commission to go out to the Middle East with the Arab bureau in the first world war, and allowed audiences to savour his marvellous profile, Peter O'Toole's Lawrence blows out a match and the scene changes to the burning desert at sunrise. The screen is ablaze. The dunes undulate in the heat, and Maurice Jarre's score ululates along with it.
It is Lawrence's destiny to unite warring Arab tribes to fight the Turks and the Ottoman empire in the British interest. But Lawrence's own loyalties become divided, and he falls in love with the Arab nations and all their fondly (or condescendingly) imagined ascetic martial heroism, perhaps the way Byron did with Greeks during the war of independence a century before. Lawrence's Seven Pillars became a key text of orientalism, and the movie intuits its romantic grandeur, while amplifying its absurdity and conceit.
As for O'Toole, he made one of the most outrageously charismatic debuts in film history with his performance: a Valentino for the 1960s, one of the working-class young lions like Caine and Finney. He is physically beautiful, with mesmeric eyes of china blue. His long, handsome face was that of a seducer, a visionary, an anchorite, a sinner or a saint, and is entirely comfortable with the ambiguities of his sexual nature, about which the movie is reasonably frank.
It is an oddity that there are no women characters: Lawrence's love affair is with the desert, with the pan-Arab nations and, well, with Arabs themselves. Omar Sharif is superb as his ally Sherif Ali – he made almost as much of a career-defining splash as O'Toole – although it is uncomfortable now to see Alec Guinness cast in blackface as the wily Prince Feisal. An exhilarating, immersive experience.

The Falcons are believed to be waiting for the Seahawks to finish the Super Bowl so that they can go ahead and hire Seattle defensive coordinator Dan Quinn as their next head coach, but that hasn't stopped them from moving forward with other coaching moves.
They've decided on Kyle Shanahan as their next offensive coordinator and they may be moving forward with his defensive counterpart as well. Mike Jones of the Washington Post reports that the Falcons have set up an interview with Redskins defensive backs coach Raheem Morris and that the expectation is that Morris will take the position.
Morris interviewed for the coordinator job in Washington as well as the one with the Giants, but both teams went in other directions with their ultimate hire. Morris has never been a coordinator at the pro level, although working under Quinn wouldn't be quite a full coordinator role because Quinn is expected to still call the defensive plays.
Morris played for Hofstra when Quinn was an assistant and then joined him on the coaching staff at the Long Island school before both men moved on for other jobs. Morris and Shanahan were both on the same Washington staff in 2012 and 2013.
AN Eskom conspiracy theory and stage 3 load shedding may finally have woken up the country to the realities of the utility's meltdown. Late in 2014 the writing was on the wall: I assembled what little unplanned outage data Eskom had made public from time to time, and then I drew a trend line. The data predicts total grid failure, with less than 50 percent of generating capacity available, no later than early-mid 2016, irrespective of Lynne Brown's ministerial mumblings to the contrary. However, the big question is why the situation is still deteriorating, instead of having begun to improve at some point during the last five years.
It is easily said that things must get worse before they can improve, but not to this degree or so many years down the road. Management should have recognised the onset of disaster, acted appropriately, and enabled their engineers to take the necessary measures. However, it is now common cause that Eskom has little, if any, of what conventional corporates would recognise as management, much less a meaningful board of directors.
That said, engineers are a generally resilient and resourceful bunch, and one would expect them to get on with the job themselves, at least as far as available facilities and faculties permit.
Meanwhile, it cannot escape notice that the Matimba power station, way out in the bundu with its coal solely supplied by the Grootgeluk mine, is never cited as having unplanned outages.
This compares with the frequent failures of the Duvha, Majuba, Kendal, Tutuka, et al power stations, all in Mpumalanga and all supplied by a horde of junior coal producers (owned by the usual crowd of politically connected individuals), similar to the way in which the gas turbine power stations are supplied with diesel by dentists and beauticians.
Of course, the coal supplies are based on principal supplies from the major producers, such as BHP Billiton and Exxaro, and one assumes that those supplies are largely unaffected by Eskom's problems, while a power station's reduced coal consumption results in the junior producers being preferentially instructed to halt coal deliveries, to prevent coal storage capacity being exceeded.
The upshot is that the junior producers are still paid for the undeliverable coal on a contractual “take or pay” basis, very much to their financial advantage and Eskom's cost. This scenario explains why Eskom has had considerable problems with controlling the cost of coal supplies, with the average prices paid approaching those paid for export grade coal, while Eskom actually consumes low-grade coal unfit for export.
It also means that it is very much in the interest of the junior producers to subvert a power station's technical staff to allow, if not cause, the failure of generation units. This suggestion borders on outrageous, but no more outrageous than the Nkandla scam, the Marikana massacre, or the SA National Roads Agency Limited's imposition of e-tolls on Gauteng's freeways.
A component of the inquiry into Eskom's management should be lifestyle audits on influential power station personnel, as well as publication of the entire roster of coal suppliers contracted by Eskom. The latter would allow the press to uncover the web of political cronyism at play and eventually join the dots of the Eskom puzzle which, incidentally, includes no point tagged with “old, worn-out power station”.

A submission from former parliamentarians arguing they should keep their taxpayer-funding perks has been removed from the Parliament's website after a request for it to be kept secret.
Sources were unable to confirm who asked on Monday that the submission, made to a Senate inquiry into the Abbott government's proposed changes to the Gold Pass Scheme, be kept from public scrutiny. The scheme allows former MPs some travel on the public purse.
At least 50 flights have been cancelled this week due to the heatwave.
The Association of Former Members of Parliament of Australia's submission argued that stripping back their perks would be "unconscionable" and "unconstitutional".
The submission was uploaded to the Senate inquiry's website on Friday and taken down on Monday hours after The West Australian reported its contents.
Rep. Elijah Cummings and his colleagues stated "The Seven Member Rule is not a regulation or guideline, but a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President." | AP Photo Dems step up demands for Trump hotel records Oversight fight over 'seven-member rule' could be headed to court
House Democrats are escalating their battle against a Trump administration directive instructing federal agencies not to respond to oversight requests issued by Democratic lawmakers.
The White House acknowledged the new policy last week, backed by a Justice Department legal opinion that says individual members of the House and Senate don't have a special right to obtain executive branch information beyond the way members of the public can through Freedom of Information Act requests.
Story Continued Below
Democratic lawmakers have been battling the administration over their demands for various records related to the Trump International Hotel, which operates on a lease from the federal government's General Services Administration. President Donald Trump has retained ownership of his businesses, though he has said he is not involved in managing them.
The 18 Democratic members of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee stepped up their efforts to get the documents Monday by sending a letter to the GSA invoking a somewhat-obscure 1928 law that allows any seven members of the panel to demand information from the executive branch. It provides a rare legal basis for minority-party lawmakers to conduct oversight without the approval of congressional leaders.

"The Seven Member Rule is not a regulation or guideline, but a statute that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President," the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, and his colleagues wrote in a letter to acting GSA chief Tim Horne.
"Although you may wish to limit oversight from Democratic Members of Congress through a misguided policy that responds only to Republican Chairmen, compliance with federal law is not an optional exercise that may be overridden by a new Trump Administration policy. "
The letter cites past litigation over the so-called seven-member rule, including a battle between the George W. Bush administration and Democrats that resulted in a 2002 district court ruling requiring disclosure of census data the administration did not wish to release. The Justice Department appealed that ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, but no resolution of the appeal was ever reached because the court ordered release of the data in parallel Freedom of Information Act case.
Asked if the Democrats would go to court if the Trump administration defies the request, a committee aide said: “Of course, our preference would not to be to pursue litigation, but rather to obtain the documents we asked for months ago. We do not understand why the Trump administration is reversing its position on this issue — especially since the president's internal dealings with GSA should be a matter of public record.”
Democrats say they got the information from GSA under the same rule during the Obama administration. The data included monthly revenue reports for Trump's hotel, which his companies are required to submit under the lease. GSA did not respond to an email last night seeking comment on the letter. However, a GSA official said last month that the information stream was cut off at the direction of the Trump administration.
The four-page Office of Legal Counsel opinion the Justice Department released last week argues that individual lawmakers have no special right to information.
"Individual members who have not been authorized to conduct oversight are entitled to no more than 'the voluntary cooperation of agency officials or private persons,'" acting Assistant Attorney General Curtis Gannon wrote. "Individual members of Congress, including ranking minority members, do not have the authority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation by a full house, committee, or subcommittee."
The opinion, dated May 1, does not directly address the seven-member rule or cite the statute that created it. Democrats, however, argued in their letter that the rule applies to their request for information from the GSA.
"This opinion is flawed in many ways, but even taking it at face value, GSA must comply with requests submitted under the statutory Seven Member Rule," Cummings and the other Democrats wrote.
Experts on oversight disputes involving Congress and the White House said they would not be surprised if this one ends up in court.
"That's quite possible and even likely and, I would say, sadly so," said George Mason University professor Mark Rozell, who studies executive privilege fights. "Until several years ago, the parties usually had good-faith negotiations to figure out some way to compromise in these access-to-information disputes. Now, it seems the parties ratchet up the conflict and put it before the courts which is really a failure in the system."
Rozell said the legal issue falls in a "constitutional gray area" and predicted it could lead to an "excruciatingly long" court battle.
A lawsuit a House panel filed in 2012 against Attorney General Eric Holder over records in the Operation Fast and Furious investigation is still pending at a federal appeals court, nearly five years later.
Rozell said he believes the fact the current request comes solely from Democratic members increases the complexity of the battle, but doesn't mean the members will lose. "It's complicated that this is being driven by the minority party. No doubt about it," the professor said. "But mere minority status does not mean they have no standing to request information or to investigate."
Former House counsel Stanley Brand noted that in recent oversight battles that went to court those suing had a vote of the full House to authorize the litigation. However, he said the seven-member request — in this case an 18-member request — has the advantage of a full-blown statute backing it up.
"In one sense, you could argue it's a stronger demonstration of standing than the typical case where you have a single house of Congress issuing a resolution," Brand said. He said the critical question may not be whether Congress has the right to demand the information, but whether the courts have the legal authority to take up such a case without an explicit enforcement mechanism in the law.
Asked why the legal opinion issued last month made no reference at all to the provision the Democrats are invoking, Brand said the Justice Department has argued that the seven-member rule is not enforceable in court.
"They don't like the seven-member rule and they don't believe in it," he said.
The fight over the census records a decade and a half ago caused a partisan split among House leaders. Minority leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) supported the suit, while Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill), Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) said the dispute should be left to the political branches.
However, Hastert was not above invoking the rather obscure rule upon occasion.
In 1994, he was part of a group that turned to the rule to obtain records related to the Whitewater affair involving President Bill Clinton. The House lawmakers embraced the rule after the courts turned down Freedom of Information Act suit seeking the same information. The House members ultimately got the data they were seeking.

VANCOUVER -- A harm reduction group on the front line of Vancouver's overdose crisis can now include a small, furry mouse on the list of lives it has saved.
Melissa Patton was volunteering with the Overdose Prevention Society in the city's Downtown Eastside on Sunday when a woman showed up with a pet mouse, saying the animal had eaten heroin.
The animal was "pretty comatose," barely moving and barely breathing, she said.
"You can't really Narcan her because she's so tiny, like with an injection," Patton said, referring to the brand name for the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.
"So I just put a little Narcan on my finger and I put it on her nose and she wiped it off with her paws and was licking it."
Patton, a pharmacy student, happened to be recovering from pneumonia so was carrying a small oxygen tank with her at the time.
"I put that on a super, super low dose and I put that against her nose as well," she said. "That seemed to help a little bit."
Skin-on-skin contact is important, Patton added, so she kept the animal against her neck and provided water and protein powder through a syringe.
By the following morning the animal had made a full recovery, with replenished energy and a renewed appetite.
"Right now she really seems to like Cheerios, bananas and strawberries," Patton said, laughing.
Patton named the animal Snuggles after the owner said she was going in for detox treatment the following day and needed someone to look after her animal.
The society's co-founder, Sarah Blyth, said the incident highlights how the organization's volunteers go above and beyond to look after the approximately 600 clients they see every day.
"They're dealing with emergency situations all the time and they're just angels, really," she said.
Blyth said it isn't common that pets overdose but she has heard reports of some receiving naloxone after their owners have left out drugs. It is especially dangerous when children are involved, she added.
"People need to know to be careful with their drugs around children and pets," Blyth said. "Drugs and kids and pets are really just not good."
Blyth added that it was unfortunate that it takes a mouse overdosing for the opioid crisis to make headlines, but anything that brings attention to the situation is a good thing.
In the first three months of this year, 347 people died of drug overdoses in the province, a figure significantly higher than the same period last year when health officials declared a state of emergency.
Patton said helping pets is part of how overdose-prevention sites care for people.
"What is important to the client is important to us," she said. "If we can take away the barriers that are going to prevent somebody from getting the help then we're going to do that."
This is what snuggles looked like when she came in to our overdose Prevention Site #vanpoli pic.twitter.com/9Osv4HSSjO — sarah blyth (@sarahblyth) May 15, 2017
Shadow Wireless Earbuds is rated 3.8 out of 5 by 124 .
Rated 1 out of 5 by Ravinder from Bad Quality I bought this product in Sep 2017 and on 3 instances it stopped working abruptly and would not turn on within few months of usage. I got it replaced twice in 1 Yr of service but again 3rd time it stopped working. Seems this product has really bad production quality
Rated 1 out of 5 by Tami from KNOCK-OFFS??? No one can hear me on phone calls!! I've owned three pairs of these headsets and i've never had a problem with them. I've always been able to use them when driving for making phone calls or listening to music. This last pair that I purchased on Amazon are horrible. No one can hear me when using them to make phone calls which is one of the best features. All the other pair that I bought came from Best Buy. I will not be buying these on Amazon again. I will be purchasing them at Best Buy. These must be CHINESE MADE KNOCK-OFFS or something. Do not buy them from Amazon.
Rated 5 out of 5 by jaydabaws from Dope great bass and mids ok highs super comfy long lasting battery
Rated 2 out of 5 by Kevlar from Dissapointed Purchased my first pair of SOL REPUBLIC wireless headphones two years ago and was very satisfied with them. Unfortunatley they where destroyed in a work accident. Looked forward to the new pair. Second pair of headphones where a disappointment. Everyone who called me complained of not being able to hear me when I spoke to them. Did not experience this with first pair of headphones.
It's rare that I agree with Michael Gove on anything, and not just because he's tried the Atkins diet. From his love of Mumford & Sons to his holiday souvenir choice of swimming trunks in the style of lederhosen to his belief that we should all be texting each other love poems instead of sexy talk, suffice to say I see myself as his polar opposite. Except on one point: careers advisers. Govey's refusal to let them back into schools to unleash their lacklustre CV-building tips on the younger generation can only be applauded. Not once has a careers adviser given me a single snippet of useful information, but plenty of people in my chosen profession have, and, as Gove says, they're the ones who should be giving the advice. He calls them business leaders, but I call them simply: people who know what they're on about. Careers advisers, meanwhile, don't. Sorry.
Take that little profile bit they tell you that you need at the top of your CV, for example. Every school CV workshop I ever had, whether part of some tedious careers advice seminar or this horrific programme introduced in 2000 called "Key Skills", which rebranded maths as something called "application of number" and English as "communication", suggested that you begin your CV with a paragraph in which you describe yourself. So for years, I'd been doling out this trite document that contained meretricious sentences such as: "I am an enthusiastic and motivated individual." Not quite as bad as that girl on Twitter who had "likes wanking" surreptitiously added to hers, but not great either. It wasn't until an editor at Vogue asked to see it before returning it marked with a red pen and handing me a template she'd made herself that I realised: a CV needn't contain prose at all, especially not self-satisfied prose. Thanks, careers advisers.
Perhaps it's different outside of the state system, but careers advisers were never especially good at fostering grand ambitions among the student body, either. Around age 15, we were made to sit a multiple choice test which supposedly then informed you of your career destiny. Disappointingly, it didn't seem to have especially high hopes for most of the people in my year. Even those with the most potential were designated low-skilled work. From the results, you'd have expected us to have turned out to be a cohort of school caretakers and fish farmers (a popular result, I'm told). There were several future undertakers, while a friend of mine was branded a budding "lorry driver's assistant", but no sports car designers, doctors, or scientists (some of my ex-classmates' current jobs). Not that there's anything wrong with any of these careers (indeed, we suspected that the results may have been rigged due to a shortage of fish farmers that year), it's just that, much like when you go to the Jobcentre, there didn't seem to be much attention paid to graduate jobs. We just weren't expected to be graduates.
I've learned that the best people to help you in your chosen career are people within that career, especially if you're a minority, which as a woman in a male-dominated workplace you might well be. Encouraging people working across a variety of professions to go and inspire the next generation of school-leavers by talking to them, mentoring them, and setting up professional networks is what we should be doing. In the end, talking to a careers adviser can be useful, but only if you want to grow up to be a careers adviser. It's not something I would recommend. There's not that many jobs going.
2017 KTM 1290 Super Duke GT Review
Ultimate MotorCycling President Arthur Coldwells has yet to board his return flight home from Spain, but he had to share some quick facts from his First Ride review of the KTM Super Duke GT. Coldwells spent a day riding KTM's latest sport tourer in Mallorca, a Spanish island in the Mediterranean Sea. Photos courtesy of KTM.
1. The main differences between the KTM Super Duke R and the GT are the fairing and screen, semi-active electronic suspension, a larger 6-gallon fuel tank, a longer rear sub-frame and lowered rear foot pegs for passenger comfort, hard luggage, a slightly re-tuned engine, and cruise control.
2. The GT is an undiluted Super Duke R. It produces the same peak power but at 1000 rpm earlier, and the same torque, but delivery is spread over a wider range. The ride is as gentle as you need it to be, but if you want to unleash “The Beast” (as KTM calls it), at the twist of the throttle in pretty much any gear the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT will be as aggressive as you need it to be.
3. Despite now complying with Euro 4 emissions, the fueling is as smooth as ever. I only used Sport mode no matter how twisty the road—it is that smooth on/off throttle. In fact, the fueling is so smooth yet responsive, that there are never any unpleasant surprises, especially mid-corner when rolling back on the gas.
4. Electronics are exemplary: ABS that works in harness with the MSC (Motorcycle Stability Control) that is bank angle sensitive and prevents wheel slip either under braking or acceleration; Hill Hold Control and Motor Slip Control (back torque limiting system helped by the slipper clutch) are all the same as the Super Duke R, however cruise control is added for long distance riders. The KTM 1290 Super Duke GT also has self-canceling indicators as part of the bank angle sensor and they work great. Heated grips are standard and are accessed via the menu system; there is no separate switch.
5. The semi-active WP suspension is amazing—it's essentially the same as on the Super Adventure, but on the GT it has much shorter travel so it has to react very quickly to road conditions. The preload can only be adjusted while stationary, and has the four usual modes (rider only; Rider + luggage; Rider + Passenger; Rider and passenger plus luggage). But the damping is adjustable on the fly and has three modes: Sport, Street, and Comfort. They have an amazing range – the difference between Sport and Comfort is huge; Street is somewhere in the middle.
Sport is very close to the Super Duke R in handling, and that was the benchmark the engineers used to calibrate it. Street and Comfort give the bike a nice floating feeling over road irregularities, as if the KTM Super Duke GT was suspended. There is almost no dive at all under braking, so in very twisty sections it makes the bike a little harder to turn—but under those conditions and if you're hustling, you should be in Sport mode anyway. The suspension works incredibly well; response time is 20 milliseconds for the damping to change, so it is dramatically superior to conventional suspension as you can decide on the road condition at any given moment whether you want a soft, pleasant ride, or you want sportbike handling.
6. The screen is manually height adjustable and provides decent wind protection.
7. The quick-detachable, frameless hard panniers are included. They can include soft inner bags as an option. The KTM 1290 Super Duke GT's bags have good capacity and will take a full face helmet. Though spacious, careful attention has been paid to make them not too wide and cut outs in front allow the passenger decent legroom.
8. Touring slanted ergonomics are outstanding. The bars are 25mm wider and slightly higher than the Super Duke R – they are almost perfect shoulder width and ideal for all day rides. The risers can be reversed so the rider has a choice as to how far forward he leans. The seat is very comfortable, and heat is an option with a separately controlled passenger heated seat as well. The footpegs are not rubberized (but don't need it), and their positioning feels the same as the Super Duke R, so the position is relaxed.
9. At 505 lbs. curb weight (444 lbs. dry) with no luggage, the KTM 1290 Super Duke GT is only 33 lbs heavier than the Super Duke R and makes it the lightest sport-tourer with the best power-to-weight ratio in the category. It is shod with Pirelli Angel GT tires and it feels incredibly nimble and maneuverable even in the tightest of twisties.
10. The GT must be the only touring motorcycle that comes with a quickshifter! It works very well and has been calibrated to work smoothly even at slow speeds around town. It only an upshifter, no blip-downshifter as yet. Otherwise the gearbox is silky smooth and goes up and down the ratios with minimal effort at the foot. Gear ratios and final sprocket sizes are the same as the Super Duke R.
11. Price in the States is TB, but will be just under $20,000 (around $2,500 more than the Super Duke R). KTM says it will be available in dealers around August/September as an early release 2017 model.
12. The last thing you need to know is that the Super Duke GT rides absolutely fabulously. It's fast, handles impeccably, and is truly an all-day comfortable motorcycle.

When PlayStation 4 was revealed in New York City on February 20, it showed the very first glimpse into what's next for Sony's line of consoles. And a link making the rounds over the last couple of days seems to put into perspective how significant the reveal was, at least for folks on the Internet.
That link, which is YouTube's Ads Leaderboard for February 2013, is “a collection of ads people chose to watch and share this month” on the world's most popular video service. And the number one video, seen below, is for PlayStation 4.
Posted on February 20, the video managed to be watched 26,296,340 times in a period of only eight days, and beat its next closed competition, an ad from Samsung, by nearly five million views (and that ad was posted on February 2nd).
What does this tell us? Well, it only tells us something anecdotal: that the Internet is very, very interested in the PlayStation 4 (interest which is heavily reflected on IGN as well). It also makes us wonder just how big Microsoft's yet-undisclosed Xbox reveal will be. Something tells me we can expect very similar numbers for that.

Pillow talk is dreaded in this household due to all the nasty things the pillow has to say. Not even nasty good! Nasty bad! And not nasty bad good either! Nasty bad awful! Fortunately neither kids nor people who spend their living coming up with new words for “sexy” have twisted the meaning of “awful” yet or that would go on far longer than it need to.
I just saw Kristof's play earlier today. It started with him reenacting what I normally watch him doing for real. Very convincing! I was almost fooled, but then I told myself “No! There's no way Kristof could stay that still in front of so many people for that long!”

And hark, I was correct! He danced around admirably for the next hour or so almost without fail! The Dumb Waiter is a story you'd probably be familiar with, as the excellent In Bruges takes a lot of it's cues from the play.
Even so there were some confusing bits which I demanded Kristof to “Come outside and explain yourself!”
He did. To the best of his abilities.
The leaders of Mexico and Canada on Thursday pledged to work toward a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) even as talks taking place in the United States turned sour due to hard-line U.S. demands.
Speaking in Mexico City as a fourth round of talks to rehash NAFTA was held near Washington, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said they were committed to a “win-win-win” deal.
The talks in the United States hit obstacles, with tensions increasing dramatically Thursday due to U.S. demands that include adding a so-called “sunset clause” to NAFTA that would force negotiations of the $1 trillion pact every five years.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks in Arlington, Virginia described the atmosphere as “horrible” and highly charged.
“We will not be walking away from the table based on the proposals put forward,” Trudeau said at a news conference in response to a question about whether the clause was a poison pill for the talks.
Asked whether bilateral deals were possible if talks failed, Pena Nieto said Mexico would keep working with both Canada and the United States to reach a deal that was beneficial for all three countries, but he suggested there could be other ways to move forward.
“I think that Canada and Mexico share that the NAFTA agreement is a good mechanism, not the only one, but it is a good mechanism to boost the development of the region,” Pena Nieto said.
U.S. President Donald Trump says NAFTA, originally signed in 1994, has been a disaster for the United States and he has frequently threatened to scrap it unless major changes are made.
Besides the sunset clause, the United States also wants to modify dispute settlement mechanisms and boost the amount of U.S. content that autos must contain to qualify for tax-free status.
Business leaders from all three countries have said the U.S. proposals could derail the talks.
Earlier on Thursday Mexican Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said Mexico was analyzing tariffs and import substitution plans in case NAFTA was scrapped.
“We have the possibility of identifying tariff measures, we have the possibility to identify other markets to be our providers and other markets that we can turn to,” Meade told senators in the capital.
“We're working on that, we have been working and perfecting the analysis to identify not only industries but companies that could help the contingency if we don't reach a satisfactory negotiation.”
Meade did not give details of what tariffs were being analyzed. In 2011, Mexico successfully used targeted tariffs on U.S. goods such as pork and cheese to win a dispute over trucks.
Meade's comments and the tensions at the talks drove the peso to a nearly five-month low of 18.92 against the dollar, a fall of more than 1 percent in the session. The currency has shed close to 4 percent since Oct. 3 on concerns the NAFTA talks could founder.

Tommy Osh recently with Natalie KratsasIn recent days, Tommy Osh was excited to try to launch a new rock scene in a club about to open in Squirrel Hill next Friday.
The bassist had a lot of scene history to draw from, having been one of the fixtures in the Pittsburgh punk/glam scene of the '80s and '90s at the Decade and Electric Banana.
He was hoping to bring back that vibe to 2014 at the new Squirrel Hill Sports Bar, and had been reaching out to old friends and media throughout the week. In the wee hours of Thursday morning, the 47-year-old Osh, whose real name was Thomas Oshanick, was killed in a two-car crash near the Hot Metal Bridge on the South Side.
“More often than not, Tommy Osh was the loudest most ludicrous guy in the room,” said Ed Masley, musician and former P-G rock critic. “And this is in rooms full of really loud, totally ludicrous people. But he had this inner core of sweetness and he wasn't shy about letting that show either. If you came up through the Oakland scene when I did, Osh was a huge, undeniably lovable part of your extended dysfunctional family.
Osh grew up in South Oakland and graduated from Central Catholic in the early '80s with his sights set on the rock scene.
“I remember walking to Central past the Decade and going to see who's on that board outside,” he told the PG in 2000.
He and his best friends — including Angelo Amantea and Dave Sestilli — knew the doorman at Decade and would sneak in to see bands like the Iron City Houserockers and Norm Nardini and the Tigers.
“Norman coming out with whipped cream on his face and a dress on, that's where it started for us. The debauchery of it,” Osh said.
“He was a rock 'n' roll kid,” said Nardini. “He was really as a kid who grew upon rock 'n' roll. They were like the original punkers: Bobby Lamonde, Rocky Lamonde, Angelo, Dave Sestili. The rock 'n' roll side of punk. Good kids. Tommy's look was imposing, but as soon as you talked to him, he gave you respect. Just a cool guy. Nothing negative about Tommy.”
Sparked by Nardini's antics, what came next for Osh and his crew was a whole slew of thrashy bands that maintained the original spirit of rock 'n' roll, and amped it up quite a bit.
Tommy Osh (right)Osh, Amantea and Sestilli formed their first band, Outta Hand, in the early ‘80s. It evolved into The Addicts right as Osh was busy with the New York Dolls-inspired Trash Vegas with another friend from Central, Bobby LaMonde. The band released its debut album on the local garage-rock label, Get Hip.
Forced to choose between the two bands, Osh stayed with The Addicts, which featured Amantea, Sestilli and Ashtabula transplant Ray Chmielewski. The Addicts became the Social Wrecks in 1995 before disbanding and then re-emerging a year later as The Ultimatics with Osh, Amantea, Terry Thomas and Chmielewski.
Taking their name from a toilet paper dispenser — Osh's idea — they debuted in 1997 with a 7-inch EP on the German label Dim and followed that with a full-length album on Beach/Wurmhole, a San Francisco indie label whose roster included the Suicide Machines.
The release coincided with the death of Chmielewski in Amsterdam.
“Everything was a blur. And it had no bearing, I guess. The CD coming in probably didn't mean a thing to me compared to losing a best friend,” Osh said a few years after.
The band forged on and won the Graffiti Rock Challenge in 2000 before splitting two years later.
“The Ultimatics were a big deal for me when I started playing in a local band,” said Pamela Simmons, frontwoman for Motorpsychos. “Tommy was always fun, sweet, and genuine with me.”
Osh's most recent project was playing bass in Tom Kurlander & PaleBlueSound, more of a'70s style California folk-rock band led by a Pittsburgh native (brother of screenwriter Carl Kurlander) who had been living in LA. They debuted two years ago with “Sugar Burn Sessions,” an album recorded at Mr. Small's, and were planning to pay the Sports Bar's opening night on Friday.
Tom Kurlander & Pale Blue Sound (Osh on right)In the meantime, Osh, who is survived by daughter Phoenix and a granddaughter, worked a variety of day jobs (including recently being a delivery driver for an Asian restaurant in Squirrel Hill). On the side, he was pursuing projects in graphic design and having booked the Decade's Alternative Mondays, he was looking forward to doing the booking at this new club owned by Barry White.
Vinni Belfiore, a longtime friend and member of SouthSide Allstars, was working with Osh recently on setting up a steady Thursday night jam session at the club.
“Tommy Osh was the embodiment of rock n' roll,” Belfiore said. “He lived it. His outlook was always positive and he was so excited about this new club gig. He had booked my band and asked me to meet with the owners about setting up a jam night for me to host. He loved the idea of bringing musicians together. He was an incredibly good soul and our music community has lost a tremendous asset in Tommy. I am devastated.”
“He was my friend from childhood,” said musician Anthony (Rocky) Lamonde. “We all grew up in south Oakland. Played in bands together and have been brothers for life. I'm devastated about this. And I miss him already. I feel crushed. He was an awesome human being.”
“It's hard to imagine that whole intersection of the Decade and Banana scenes that happened in the '90s without Tommy cracking everybody up at 2 or 3 or 4 a.m.,” Masley said. “He brought a lot of heart and soul to that whole scene. And he could really play that bass.”
Teach for America, the program that recruits top college graduates to teach for two years in public schools that are difficult to staff, has experienced a year of prodigious growth and will place 3,700 new teachers this fall, up from 2,900 last year, a 28 percent increase.
That growth was outpaced, however, by a surge in applications from college seniors. About 24,700 applied this spring to be teachers, up from 18,000 last year, a 37 percent increase, according to figures released by the organization on Wednesday.
The nonprofit program sent its first 500 recruits into American public school classrooms in 1990. It has a large recruiting staff that visits campuses, contacting top prospects and recruiting aggressively. Founded by a Princeton graduate, it has always carefully sifted through applicants' grade-point averages and other data in recruiting. But with the numbers of applicants increasing faster than the number of teachers placed, it was even more selective this year than before, the organization said.
About 11 percent of the graduating class at Yale applied, 10 percent at Georgetown and 9 percent at Harvard, said Amy Rabinowitz, a spokeswoman.

It was the No. 1 employer on many campuses, including at Duke, Emory, George Washington, Georgetown, New York University, and Spelman, Ms. Rabinowitz said. The campuses with the largest number of recruits, however, were large, prestigious public universities. About 90 recruits are from the University of Michigan, and about 60 from the University of Illinois, while Wisconsin, Berkeley and the University of Texas are each sending 50 recruits, Ms. Rabinowitz said.
The program will place teachers in 29 locations this fall. Those include many of the nation's biggest cities and some largely rural states, like South Dakota, where about 50 recruits work on Indian reservations. About 1,000 recruits teach in New York City schools.
Storage technology is crucial to the growth of solar, but its deployment could be challenging. Grid-connected energy storage lacks clear expectations and standards among manufacturers, so how can developers know their systems will operate correctly and safely?
“It's a very confusing marketplace,” said Davion Hill, energy storage leader for North America at DNV GL. “There are IEC, UL and various other standards for batteries, but none say why or how you should use them—they're just there. Putting myself in the shoes of developers or battery manufacturers, I can totally understand their confusion. We wanted to develop something to help navigate that path.”
Knowing successful storage implementation would require clarity and agreement on rules and regulations, DNV GL initiated the GRIDSTOR joint industry project.
GRIDSTOR aimed to accelerate implementation of grid-connected storage systems through a recommended practice for system safety, operation and performance. DNV GL invited a diverse selection of industry stakeholders—including major international suppliers, end users and regulators—to join the consortium. Together, they worked to fill gaps left by existing standards and create internationally-recognized guidelines. The consortium examined more than 150 standards—many from a DOE-published inventory—and listed them under sections of safety, operation and performance. The recommended practices are generic for all types of grid-connected electricity storage systems, with an emphasis on high-energy batteries.
“We didn't just want to point to industry standards, but explain where, how and why to use them,” Hill said.
The BEST test
Though the GRIDSTOR recommendations are meant to be used by any manufacturer or testing agency, DNV GL also offers its own GRIDSTOR compliance, qualification and customized testing services in its BEST (battery and energy storage technology) facility in Rochester, New York.
For battery manufacturers, DNV GL can perform qualification tests and award an IEC certificate just like other accreditation centers, but Hill explained the center's capabilities go much further.
“Many times manufacturers want to test how they're better or different than their competition,” he said. “Not only can we accredit them to the same certificate to which their competitor was just certified, but we can make testing conditions harsher, playing with aspects such as temperature, to test where they're strong. We act as an independent lab to test their claim.”
Still, many of the center's clients have been turned out to be banks and developers looking for evidence that storage solutions will meet project expectations.
Michael Mills-Price is head of DNV GL's inverter testing business and also works at the storage facility. He explained how he assists clients at all levels of the solar market, from residential through utility, who are now aggressively looking at storage as part of their future portfolios.
“Let's say a developer is looking to do business in Hawaii, which has unique environmental and regulatory conditions,” he said. “The developer wants to know if a given storage solution will perform safely and well enough for that facility (household or commercial building) to maximize the project economics over the stated warranty period. We can develop tests to give them a good idea if the technology will meet their expectations.”
DNV GL can test a system—battery, battery management system and inverter—even at the individual battery cell level. Testers examine battery degradation rates associated with various charge and discharge cycles within parameters, such as specific loads and temperatures, associated with the unique application. Results are analyzed and compared with previous results in the center's ever-growing database. Analysts are able to use internal software to build a case for the customer.
“We can say, OK, if you're developing solar on homes in Hawaii with these loads and this battery or storage system, you can expect this performance from onset through to year five or 10 of the warranty period,” Mills-Price said. “There truly are sweet spots for different battery chemistries in terms of how they're operated. By evaluating a myriad of conditions specific to an application, we can make recommendations based on real lab testing data.”
Challenges to storage testing
Unlike with inverter and module companies, Hill explained that most battery manufacturers still choose to do their own testing rather than have their product independently verified.
“Battery manufacturers have a strong competitive advantage in that they have been testing their battery cells longer than anyone,” he explained. “Doing in-depth third-party testing is long and expensive—something not every manufacturer or developer is willing to take on. If you are a developer looking at storage options in the middle of a time-sensitive contract and a battery manufacturer is showing you reams of their testing data, why would you stop and do independent testing?”
In these cases, DNV GL is often pulled in as the independent engineer to validate the data. “It's not as good as running application-specific independent testing, but the market really isn't always asking for that right now,” Hill said.
Possible solutions
Currently, independent testing procedures specific to solar don't exist. Hill noted he has yet to see the solar industry push for these, but explained how other industries have. “Reliability is so key for the automotive market. You can't develop a car, then leave your customers by the side of the road,” he said. “Their need to develop independent testing and validation was strong and early.”
Hill could, however, see a push in several instances. “Inverter and panel manufacturers could be a catalyst,” he said. “They're used to showing developers third-party data and may come to demand this data from their battery vendors as well. Banks could also lead the way, asking developers to provide third-party testing data, who will in turn ask their vendors—whatever the bank says goes. Lastly, not to sound like a fearmonger, but usually a push comes after a crisis where millions of dollars are at risk. Then people say, ‘Why don't we have this?'”
Hill agreed that if storage is going to be critical to solar, the industry needs to think ahead. In the meantime, the GRIDSTOR can help lower the risk of field failures and lost profits.
“The industry really isn't focused on operations, but when it is we're in a good position to help.”

We've seen how impressive footage shot with a drone and just one GoPro can be, but that's child's play compared to the band Booka Shade's most recent music video shoot. Employing the services of the drone cinematographers at Octofilms, they slapped 8 GoPros onto a drone to capture some psychedelic ‘Little Planet' style imagery.
The four minute music video that resulted from what looks to have been a whole lot of work is different from just about any other drone footage we've yet seen. A trip of a music video that switches between normal style footage and dizzying 360-degree panorama-style shots, it drives home the point that, when it comes to drone photography, much of the landscape is still unexplored.
Check out the final music video below, and then watch the BTS video at the top to see how it all came together.

A dad-of-two bled to death after bursting a spot on his arm with a knife — causing him to collapse in agony.
Andrew Robinson was trying to lance a huge cyst on his right arm.
google 2 Dad-of-two Andrew Robinson was found in a pool of blood in his flat on Queen Street, Newton Abbot
A neighbour rushed to the unemployed aircraft engineer's aid after hearing him screaming in pain.
Matthew Bardsley told an inquest that he kicked the door down to find the 47-year-old lying in a pool of blood on the floor of his flat in Newton Abbot, Devon.
He called 999 but paramedics pronounced Mr Robinson dead at the scene.

A Coroner's hearing into his death was told Mr Bardsley often helped his neighbour out with day to day tasks due to his ill health.
He had lost the feeling in his arm following an operation to treat an infection in his spine several years ago.
He since turned to hard drugs like heroin as a means of escaping his health problems.
Just hours before the tragedy on April 24 the pair walked together from a shop to their flats on Queen Street.
It was the second time Mr Robinson had hacked at the "massive" abscess, the inquest heard.
Two days before he died he was admitted to Torbay Hospital and kept overnight after trying to puncture the growth with scissors, the Torquay Herald Express reports.

"Dad you're always in our thoughts."
A police investigation concluded there was no evidence of foul play nor any indication he wanted to take his own life.
Ian Arrow, Torbay Coroner, said: "He had a large cyst on his right arm.
"It appears he may have tried to treat it with a large knife.
"While trying to lance that cyst he's caused himself to bleed quite extensively."

Police name girl who died on Drayton Manor's Splash Canyon ride
Police name girl who died on Drayton Manor's Splash Canyon ride
An investigation has been launched into the death of an 11-year-old girl who fell into the water from a river rapids ride at a Staffordshire theme park.
Evha Jannath, from Leicester, fell from the Splash Canyon ride at Drayton Manor in Tamworth.
The pupil at Leicester's Jameah Girls Academy was flown to Birmingham Children's Hospital but died shortly after arriving.
A spokesperson for Staffordshire Police said: "Evha sadly died after falling from a water ride at the theme park.

"She was recovered from the water and received advanced life support from ambulance crews before she was flown to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she later passed away.
"A Health and Safety Executive investigation has now begun with the full support of Staffordshire Police.
"The family are being supported by specially trained officers. We would ask everyone to respect the family's right to grieve in private during this extremely difficult time."
Zainab Mohammad, 26, whose 16-year-old sister Summayyah is a student at the school, told the Leicester Mercury: "Everybody is in shock. My sister is really upset about it.

"My heart goes out to the family. The school is not very big so everybody knows each other. It's really sad..."
The emergency services said they were called at 2.18pm on Tuesday and were on the scene within minutes.
Feeona Fletcher, who was on a nearby ride at the time, told Sky News: "We saw the park golf buggy thing coming down and the guy was shouting 'clear the way, clear the way'.
"Suddenly two paramedic cars came flying down through the park and into that area.
"By the time we got off the carousel, maybe a minute or two, there were fire engines, ambulances, police cars.
"The air ambulance was over our heads. It was so fast."

Drayton Manor's director, George Bryan, said staff were "immediately on the scene" after the girl fell in.
Appearing visibly shaken, he told reporters: "We're all truly shocked and devastated and our thoughts are with her family and friends at this tremendously difficult time."
Jameah Academy said in a statement that it was "liaising with the relevant authorities" and supporting pupils and staff.
The statement said the school would be closed on Wednesday.
"Please be assured that the safety and wellbeing of all of our pupils is a priority," it added.

The ride was shut after the incident, but people already inside the park were allowed to stay until the usual closing time of 5pm.
Drayton Manor will be closed today as a mark of respect.
Splash Canyon opened in 1993 and is described as Drayton Manor's "very own river rapids".
Image: A helicopter flew the girl to Birmingham Children's Hospital
It has a maximum capacity of 126 people - 21 boats with six people in each - and a minimum height of 0.9m.
The boats have a central circular bar to hold on to, but in online footage the seats do not appear to have any other restraints.
Drayton Manor, which includes a Thomas the Tank Engine-themed area, opened in 1949 and is the UK's fifth most popular theme park.
An incident on Alton Towers' Smiler ride in June 2015 led to two teenagers losing a leg and left 14 others injured.
The park was later fined £5m over health and safety failures.
Thousands of Berkeley voters got stuck in an email storm last week after a technical glitch became a viral meme that prompted around 70 residents to hold a potluck picnic Sunday.
It all started late last Tuesday when Nigel Guest, president of a Berkeley community group called the Council of Neighborhood Associations, attempted to send an email to himself that mistakenly hit the inboxes of thousands of registered voters.
The brief email, with the subject line “test,” included a single character: “x.” Instead of ignoring the message, some of the recipients responded to ask why they have gotten it. And, rather than replying only to Guest, they made the fateful, likely unintentional, decision to reply all.
Those replies, which also reached thousands, stirred up a range of sentiments and, from one recipient, threats of legal action. In the days that followed, hundreds of emails volleyed among those on the list. Amid a spate of initial questions from many about why they had received the message, one person wrote: “Oohhh a mystery, we have to figure out what we all have in common.”
Several pleaded with the group to stop replying all, and another list member cautioned: “You can't close Pandora's box once it is open.” Dozens of emails continued to be sent to the whole list, and there was no clear way to get out of the loop. According to Berkeley resident Christopher Berry, who created a “highlights reel” of the exchange and posted it online, approximately 100 emails went out over the first four hours.
One frustrated recipient wrote to Guest to complain, but her email hit the entire list: “You recently sent a test email that has resulted in an incredibly unprofessional email chain that is disrupting my studies with emails every two minutes. Please find a way to disable this email chain, or prevent this from happening in the future.”
Her note, however, only prompted a new wave of responses: “For God's sake I'm an old man and want to be left alone. I live in Mexico,” said one. Replied another: “Let's communicate like it's 1999!”
About half an hour into the exchange, several members of the list began creating graphic memes to capture the experience.
While some became irate at the intrusion, many others were highly amused by the hijinks, and sought to find ways to prolong what became known as the Berkeley “spampocalypse.” About an hour after the initial email, one person on the list suggested holding a potluck meet-up. Minutes later, a Facebook “support group” was created for people on the list who wanted to keep the hilarity going.
There was no word from Guest that first night, and one email recipient wrote: “I actually feel a little sorry for Nigel. This is not going to be pleasant to wake up to. Alternately, it's a very good [psychological] test.”
Wednesday morning, Guest sent an email titled “Sincere apologies,” to explain that he had been setting up CNA's email system when he inadvertently linked the organization's main email account to a large list of people. He asked that the “reply alls” cease, and said he was working to correct the problem.
The emails, however, did not stop. Just after 11 a.m., one list recipient said he was very concerned about the messages, and shared his theory with the group about how his address might have been compromised. He said he believed Guest had stolen his email address, using “house equipment,” when he drove by Guest's home, near the UC Berkeley Botanical Garden, on a recent outing. He wondered if Guest was “leeching on to devices that are somehow exposed.”
One woman in particular was not amused as the emails continued to roll in. About an hour after the leeching email, she sent a sternly worded message to the list to threaten legal action.
There were also reports of angry phone calls, from several unhappy list members, to Guest as well as others who “replied all” and included their contact info in their email signatures.
A woman on the Facebook “survivor” group shared the following: “I just received a phone call from an extremely irate individual threatening to call the FBI on me to report the email spam. Has anyone every tried calling the FBI? It's got to be harder than getting through to the post office.” She added: “I'm afraid to walk away from my computer 'cause someone might say something funny while I'm gone.”
Wrote Berry, in his Spampocalypse highlights round-up, “Many of us found the outrage and frivolous appeals over something so benign and beautiful to be amusing.” That afternoon, the list activity hit a new peak. Wrote Berry: “In what may be the greatest act of trolling of all time, one email recipient sent an email to the listerv with fake instructions on how to unsubscribe.”
Those instructions told list recipients to write to CNA's main email list with the words “Subscription terminate.” But, either due to continuing problems with CNA's email system, or because the instructions were meant in jest, those emails, too, continued to reach the entire list of thousands.
Word was spreading Wednesday about the list, as recipients told friends and neighbors about what had been taking place.
Wednesday afternoon, one person sent the following message to the group, with the subject line, “Please Subscribe Me?”: “There's a lot of people that want out of this list, I know a bunch of people that want to be put on this amazing list. Is there a way that we can make that happen?” People began adding interested parties to the email list, which had a 5,000-person audience, according to one person getting the messages.
Meanwhile, over in the Facebook “support group,” those who found the episode amusing rather than maddening joked and reflected on the experience.
Said one woman: “I can't stand it. I'm laughing so hard. People are still replying even as I type this! They just can't stop themselves!”
One man wrote: “This has become such an important event in my life, and no one I try to explain it to can understand.”
Wrote another, on Thursday, “As of 10:47am on March 19th, I have counted 332 individual emails in my inbox relating to this whole matter. Come on people, pick up the pace! I'm only at 49% storage capacity in my gmail account. What could I possibly do with those extra 7 or 8 gigabytes?? My inbox isn't going to fill itself up without your help, I want to see more replies. Don't stop!”
It was also in the Facebook group that it became clear how the list recipients were connected. A woman who spoke to Guest said he had been working from a voter registration list with 16,000 names on it. He told her he had mistakenly linked about 2,000 of those names to the main email account, which he had tried to use to send a message only to himself. People with last names starting with the letters A-H were included. (One person who attended the picnic said Guest later said the email actually had gone to 5,000 people. Guest did not reply to a request from Berkeleyside for comment.)
Some on the Facebook group created T-shirt and button designs to memorialize favorite moments.
Members came up with hashtags, such as #ChosenByNigel, and posited a variety of ideas about why they had been brought together and what they might do with the resulting energy and enthusiasm. Wrote one: “You have all been chosen. You will be contacted in the next 48 hours with more info regarding your mission. Best of luck.”
Wrote another: “All of us were chosen by Nigel for a greater purpose. I feel like we should do something. Together. For the community. I'm actually serious.” Others responded with ideas about what they might do, from creating “care packs for the homeless” to working with veterans or the unemployed. Another suggested that they might come up with training aimed at computer literacy classes for seniors. (Those ideas are still in development.)
Plans also firmed up for a Sunday “CNA Survivor Picnic” at Ohlone Park in North Berkeley. Wrote one group member: “Each of us had a moment where it dawned on us that this was more than an annoyance. It had become something crazy, random and hilarious. That is why I'm blowing off another potluck I was going to in order to attend the CNA Survivors picnic. I want to meet others who seized the humor and joy in the Spampocalypse and want to keep riding this random wave.”
About 70 people attended the Sunday picnic, and said the group wants to continue meeting on a monthly basis to solidify plans for volunteer efforts and build on the sense of community created by Guest's mistake. Guest attended the picnic — and received a can of Spam as a thank-you gift. At one point, participants circled up to share their favorite memories from the email exchange.
Berry, who created the “highlights reel” from the email chain, said he had not been sure what to expect at the picnic.
“I thought it was going to be terrible,” he said. “Meeting up with a new group of strangers from the internet, you never really know what you're going to get. But it was a 10 out of 10. Everyone was really friendly and really funny. We laughed and chatted, and whenever a newcomer came, the entire group welcomed them.”
Cris Benson described the group as “a good broad section of Berkeley” and said he felt it was a shared sense of humor that brought so many people together Sunday.
“It just grew organically out of proportion to what it was, and that's what made it so great,” he said Monday. “I really did find kindred spirits at the picnic just because we are all connected by our sense of humor at this mistake that was made.”
Berkeley native Ben Bartlett described last week's exchange as “some sort of groundbreaking meta event: We are in the same geographic location. We are of a similar disposition, and we took this random email spam as an excuse to come together.”
“It's really, really awesome, I've never experienced anything like it,” he continued. “Unlike social media, this was your email. It was like someone knocking on your door.”
Bartlett even composed a poem for the occasion, which he read during the sharing circle at the picnic: “The Message Came / It was a Test. / Who are you? / The people asked / Who are you? / Like yourself, / ‘I Replied All!'”
The “email storm” phenomenon has been documented on Wikipedia, but has not previously received such notoriety in Berkeley. The event is sometimes called a “Reply Allpocalypse,” and has made headlines in the past when it's struck large companies such as Microsoft, or government entities such as the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.
Bartlett hypothesized that a shared desire for community also added momentum to what transpired.
“We bonded over this,” he said. “Enough of us were into it to make it special. And I suspect that even the ones displeased by it kind of had to remark in wonder at what happened.”
Added Berry, who moved to Berkeley about three years ago and said he's not really “involved in Berkeley things”: “It was really nice to meet people who also live in Berkeley. Now I might see them at Trader Joe's and I'll know that they're my neighbor, and that they're cool.”

Help Yourself Before You Help Others
Help Yourself Before You Help Others
If you've been on an airplane then you've heard the safety walkthrough that takes place on every flight.
They show you the exits, walk you through their emergency procedures, and tell you about the oxygen masks that will come down on their own if the plane loses cabin pressure.
This is the part you really need to listen to:
“Please put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others.”
At first, this sounded weird to me. I thought that children were supposed to be helped first. Why would they make it a point to tell everyone to help themselves before aiding anyone else?
The idea is that if you're trying to put on an oxygen mask for someone else, you may lose consciousness and you'll be unable to assist others (or yourself) later. However, if you fit yourself with a mask first you'd be able to remain conscious and aid people as needed.
This got me thinking… Whenever I'm in a bad place, when I don't have the oxygen mask on, the one thing I'm unable to do is help others.
Why?
When you're in a negative mindset you're unable to make a positive impact on others because you don't see the point in it.
When you're sad you don't have the will to try to make someone else's day because you've got your own problems to worry about.
When you're angry the last thing you'd want to do is put on a smile for others because you don't think it's necessary.
It's dangerous to be in a bad point in your life for long. You'll get jaded and you'll stop trying to do good.
Your positive impact on the world only comes when you're happy. When you help yourself first.
No matter how hard it gets, you've got to keep trying to climb out of the hole.
You may not feel better today or tomorrow, but hang in there. You'll wake up one day and feel something different. You'll feel better.
Help yourself so you can help others.
Put the oxygen mask on.

THE MORNING PLUM:
The Hillary Clinton campaign has been engaged in an aggressive effort to accomplish one crucial political goal: Knocking off Bernie Sanders' halo. One common thread running through many Clinton attacks on Sanders — whether it's questioning his record on guns or suggesting his single payer dream isn't going to happen — has been to try to portray Sanders as a conventional politician (after all) who is not quite as pure as the scenes of his rapt, transported crowds suggest and is promising more than he can deliver.
As Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls continues to fall, her attacks on Bernie Sanders have stepped up. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)
Clinton may have just gotten an assist in this regard from none other than President Barack Obama.
In an interview with Politico's Glenn Thrush, this exchange happened, after Thrush asked Obama whether Sanders was successfully duplicating the optimistic, transformation-promising message that helped him defeat Clinton in 2008:
THRUSH: I mean, when you watch this, what do you — do you see any elements of what you were able to accomplish in what Sanders is doing? OBAMA: Well, there's no doubt that Bernie has tapped into a running thread in Democratic politics that says: Why are we still constrained by the terms of the debate that were set by Ronald Reagan 30 years ago? You know, why is it that we should be scared to challenge conventional wisdom and talk bluntly about inequality and, you know, be full-throated in our progressivism? And, you know, that has an appeal and I understand that. I think that what Hillary presents is a recognition that translating values into governance and delivering the goods is ultimately the job of politics, making a real-life difference to people in their day-to-day lives. I don't want to exaggerate those differences, though, because Hillary is really idealistic and progressive. You'd have to be in, you know, the position she's in now, having fought all the battles she's fought and, you know, taken so many, you know, slings and arrows from the other side. And Bernie, you know, is somebody who was a senator and served on the Veterans' Committee and got bills done. And so the— THRUSH: But it sounds like you're not buying the — you're not buying the sort of, the easy popular dichotomy people are talking about, where he's an analog for you and she is herself? OBAMA: No. No.
Obama subsequently argued that Clinton's “strengths can be her weaknesses,” acknowledging that her campaign is “more prose than poetry,” but that underlying this is an argument for Clinton, i.e., that her realism about what governing will require equips her to be president on “day one.”
[The monumental fall of the Republican Party]
What this really represents, I think, is Obama essentially taking sides in one of the fundamental underlying arguments of the 2016 Democratic primary: the battle between Clinton's and Sanders' theories of change. As I've argued, Sanders' argument represents an intriguing mix of pessimism and optimism. His case is basically that America faces structural challenges so profound and immense (soaring inequality that has resulted in oligarchy paralyzing our government; climate change that threatens to undermine the future of human civilization) that only big, big solutions proportionate to the scale of these challenges will do. Sanders further argues that such ambitious solutions are possible despite the seeming GOP grip on at least one chamber of Congress, through mobilizing the masses, particularly young people, to force another transformational moment rivaling other moments of great change in American history.
Clinton, by contrast, has suggested that the structural realities underlying our politics — the country's deep ideological divisions; our political system's built-in impediments to change; the forbidding math underlying GOP control of the House — mean that advances under the next Dem president would likely be ground out on the margins, perhaps in less-than-inspirational fashion.
Obama is basically trying to pour cold water on the loftiness of Sanders' argument, by nodding to the “appeal” of promising another transformative moment, while suggesting that Clinton's more constrained view of what can be “delivered” is more realistic, and that this is actually an attribute that recommends her for the presidency. (Note that Obama is also arguing that this doesn't mean Clinton's ideals aren't lofty, an implicit effort to signal that she needs to learn a bit more from Sanders's success.) As Thrush puts it, Obama's words signal that his “experiences in office have brought him around to Clinton's hardheaded view of the presidency.”
Here an important distinction needs to be made. In one key respect, Sanders is not making Candidate Obama's argument. Sanders is not arguing that the sheer force of persuasion can win over Republicans to compromise, a key element of Obama's promise of transformation. Rather, he is explicitly arguing that Obama did not do enough to rally the electorate to force change from the outside. Sanders flatly claims that his “difference” with Obama is that the only way to realize change is to “organize…at the grassroots level in a way that we have never done before,” which is to say, to a much greater degree than Obama did as president. We will debate whether President Obama did enough to organize pressure on Washington from the outside for many years to come. But it's worth noting, as Jonathan Chait points out, that Obama as president did in fact try to keep alive a grassroots campaign that was arguably larger than the one Sanders has produced so far, and it's unclear how much it accomplished.
And at any rate, one suspects that the Obama who is about to leave office would also dispute Sanders' account of how much can be accomplished by outside pressure on our political system.
****************************************************************************
* TRUMP-MENTUM RAGES IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE: New Fox News polls find Donald Trump leading in Iowa (he has 34 percent among GOP caucus-goers; Ted Cruz has 23 percent; and Marco Rubio has 12) and in New Hampshire (he has 31 percent; Cruz has 14; and Rubio has 13).
The polling averages now show Trump taking the lead in Iowa and leading by a large amount in New Hampshire. It is now plausible that Trump could win both early contests.
* HILLARY, BERNIE SEE DIFFERENT ROUTES TO White House: The New York Times goes deep on the differences between the Clinton and Sanders strategies to galvanize voters, and explains the contrast in their reads of the electorate this way:
Mr. Sanders's ideas and intensity could energize the party's base and, he believes, inspire a tidal wave of support from young people, ensuring a level of voter turnout that would favor the Democratic nominee….Mrs. Clinton, by embracing many of the policies of Mr. Obama and her husband, is aiming to rebuild the same coalitions that elected them, and hoping that the prospect of the first female president will draw even more women to the Democratic side this time.
What remains to be seen is whether Clinton can inspire the Obama voter groups to come out in Obama-level numbers, and that includes the younger voters that Sanders is clearly energizing.
* SANDERS VOWS MASSIVE VOTER TURNOUT: Here's Sanders, talking about his ability to inspire turnout in a new interview with the Post:
“What this campaign is about, and I'm seeing it every day, is an excitement and energy that does not exist and will not exist in the Clinton campaign. We have the capability to have a very good voter turnout. When we have a very good voter turnout, we retain the White House, we regain the Senate, we do well in the House, and we win statewide elections.”
Well, sure, but whoever wins the Dem nomination, the House is still all but certain to remain in GOP hands into the next decade, and the problem Dems will likely continue to face is that their voters don't turn out in midterm elections.
* RICK PERRY ENDORSES TED CRUZ: The former Texas governor and former presidential candidate announces his support for Ted Cruz, but to my mind, here is the most important nugget from his interview:
Perry, who also sought the GOP nomination before dropping out in September, said he now sees the race as one that is between Cruz, a fellow Texan, and Donald Trump.
Huh. What about Marco Rubio?
* DES MOINES REGISTER ENDORSES HILLARY: Over the weekend, Hillary Clinton picked up the coveted endorsement of the Des Moines Register, which hailed Bernie Sanders for highlighting inequality but ultimately said he would not be able to make good on his proposals:
Iowa Democrats will have to choose between the lofty idealism of Bernie Sanders and the down-to-earth pragmatism of Hillary Clinton. For some, this will be a choice of whether to vote with their hearts or their heads. Clinton has demonstrated that she is a thoughtful, hardworking public servant who has earned the respect of leaders at home and abroad. She stands ready to take on the most demanding job in the world.
The question is whether Iowa Dems accept this framing; many seem inclined towards the candidate who's speaking directly to their desire for a major transformative moment.
* BEHOLD THE ‘OBAMA PARADOX': E.J. Dionne explains why Sanders is doing so well among Democratic voters even though Clinton is embracing the Obama agenda to a greater degree than Sanders has:
It's the Obama Paradox. The president has a 91 percent favorable rating among Iowa Democrats (which is why Clinton is hugging him so closely). But many Democrats who admire him still wish he had been more aggressive in sticking it to the GOP. They identify with the Sanders who told me (and anyone else who'd listen) back in 2010: “While Obama and the Democrats have a large number of achievements, it was not enough. We needed to be bolder.” Most Democrats want to be bolder now.
Yes, and additionally, Sanders is explicitly arguing that the change of the Obama years has not matched the scale of the deep challenges we face.
* AND BEHOLD DONALD TRUMP, THE UNITER: No, really, that's what Donald Trump is now arguing on the campaign trail:
“I think I'll get along great with a lot of people,” Trump told a crowd of 1,500 at a Christian college in northwest Iowa. “Before I was doing this, I got along with the Democrats, with the Republicans, with the liberals, with the conservatives. I get along with people.”
Watch for this pivot. If Trump argues that he'll be “great” at uniting people, a whole lot of GOP voters just might believe it.

Former President Bill Clinton applauds as first lady Michelle Obama speaks during the first day of the Democratic National Convention. | AP Photo TV Ratings: Night one of DNC tops night one of RNC
Night one of the Democratic National Convention delivered approximately 26 million viewers during the 10 p.m.-11:30 p.m. time period, topping night one of the Republican National Convention last week, which drew approximately 23 million viewers, according to preliminary ratings data from Nielsen.
Those figures do not include people watching on TV networks not rated by Nielsen, like C-SPAN, or that streamed the convention online.
The total viewership figure is up from 2008, when 22.3 million viewers tuned into night one. It is very close to 2012's opening night, which drew 26.3 million viewers.
During the 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. time period, CNN was tops in total viewers with 6.2 million, followed by MSNBC with 4.6 million, NBC with 4.3 million, ABC with 4.1 million, Fox News with 3.3 million and CBS with 3.2 million.
In prime time from 8 p.m. to11 p.m, CNN led cable news with 5.1 million viewers, MSNBC placed second with 3.75 million viewers and Fox News averaged 3.73 million viewers.

Description of the psychic test
This simple telekinesis (aka Psychokinesis) test is a variation of the more scientific work of John Walker (called RetroPsychoKinesis, which used a hardware random number generator based on radioactive decay). Inspired by coin tossing contests, it consists of an algorithm that will randomly generate zeroes and ones (1024 total coin tosses at the speed of 10 every second), instead of heads or tails. Mathematical laws (binomial probabilities) dictate that over a certain period of time, the average between the number of 0s and 1s should be 50% / 50%, and the longer the time period, the closer the results should be to this figure. If someone tried to telekinetically influence the outcome of those coin flippings, we could possibly calculate his telekinesis ability by observing how far the results are from the statistical average.
Instructions for the psychic test
To begin the test, press START. If, at any time, you want to stop, press STOP. The test lasts roughly a minute and half (102 seconds). After you started, try to influence how many times the computer generate the number 1: focus on the number 1, or visualize the green bar going further to the right (whatever seems to work best). The green bar shows how many more time the number 1 has been generated compared to the number 0 (vice versa for the red bar). The little triangles underneath indicate the best score (difference of a number over another) you have reached during the test. A normal result close to 50% for each number would display very little bars in the middle.
The goal is to push the bar close to the right or left edge, so that the number of times one number has been generated is statistically improbable. If you reach the edge, you either possess telekinetic abilities or your computer experienced a serious fluke! Your statistics will be displayed at the bottom during the test, such as the current score, the total each number has been generated and the time remaining, but don't let it distract you too much. You can also decide to influence 0s instead of 1s (in this case, try to push the red bar to the left with your mind).
Additional info about the telekinesis test
Since the creation of this test, a few people have asked me more details about the mechanism so they can know where to consciously focus their efforts: It is programmed in Javascript, which means it is controlled by your browser, hence your computer, your memory and your CPU. It is not server based. If you succeed in influencing it substantially, it means you have influenced your computer... which even some scientists speculate it might be possible simply from a bio-electrical point of view. Some computers always have problems with certain individuals...

President Barack Obama isn't the only powerful man in Washington who was once confused for a waiter when wearing his evening best. So was a top general in the U.S. Army — by Valerie Jarrett!
As The Daily Caller first reported back in 2011, Obama's top adviser mistook a four-star general for a waiter during a fancy dinner hosted by the Alfalfa Club. According to a Daily Caller source, as the general walked by Jarrett's table, she signaled to him that she wanted more libation.
“I'd like another glass of wine,” she reportedly said.
Like a gentleman, the career military man didn't make a fuss of the matter, according to the source.
“The guy dutifully went up and got her a glass of wine, and then came back and gave it to her and took a seat at the table,” the source said. “Everyone is in tuxedos and gowns at this thing, but the military people are in full dress uniform.”
According to a corroborating report by CNN, the military man in question was then-Vice Chief of Staff of the Army Peter Chiarelli.
Discussing times they've been subjected to racist insults during a recent interview with People magazine, the Obamas mentioned how President Obama was also once mistaken for a waiter during a fancy dinner party in the days before he became the most powerful man in the world.
“He was wearing a tuxedo at a black-tie dinner, and somebody asked him to get coffee,” Mrs. Obama explained.
No word whether the Obamas think Jarrett's slight against the general was spurred by racial animus — or just an honest mistake.

If you've noticed that hands and arms have been flying pretty regularly in Marvel's Phase Two movies, congratulations: you've found the Empire Strikes Back tribute purposefully placed there by Marvel. Spoilerish information ahead.
In an interview with Cinema Blend, Marvel president Kevin Feige revealed how his love of Star Wars turned into this weird little Easter egg:
So is this a spoiler for Ant-Man… not really. I'm obsessed with Star Wars. Who's not? I'm 40 years old. I'm in the movie business. I went to USC. So I'm obsessed with Star Wars - and it didn't start out as intentional, but it became intentional, including that beat that you referenced. It sort of happens in every Star Wars movie, but I was sort of looking at it, ‘Okay, is Phase Two our Empire Strikes Back?' Not really, but tonally things are a little different. Somebody gets their arm cut off in every Phase Two movies. Every single one.

Cinema Blend has a supercut of the missing arms so far: Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3, Thor in Thor: The Dark World, and the Winter Soldier in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.
Since Feige says this happens in every Phase II movie, that means we're going to have to keep an eye out in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man. So, does the sort of maiming of the armor arm in the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster fight count, or will someone else be losing an arm? I'm betting not Thor, he did his handless duty already.
It seems like the Ant-Man scene will be fairly noticeable, if it was brought up in this interview. While I don't think we'll see an all-ant reenactment of Empire Strikes Back, I would love to the see that. LOVE TO.

A Christchurch teenager has admitted she made a false complaint of being forced into a car on Riccarton Road, tied up, and repeatedly raped.
She was told by Judge Stephen Erber in the Christchurch District Court today that her lies had "devalued the currency" for women who made genuine complaints of rape.
People might consider other women's complaints more sceptically because of the actions of 19-year-old student Michelle Anne Taruka Grafton, he said.
Grafton eventually admitted the complaint was false and pleaded guilty in court today to a charge of making a false statement that a crime had been committed.
"In explanation, she stated she did it because she liked the attention," police prosecutor Constable Michael Tualii told the court.
He said the police were called because of what Grafton told medical staff.
She told police she had been abducted by a man she knew at 3pm on Saturday December 19, from Riccarton Road.
She said he had forced her into a car, driven her to an address in Yaldhurst, and tied her hands to a sofa bed where she was forced to have sex with him several times.
She managed to escape at 7am next day, when he left for work.
A specialised medical examination for victims of sexual assaults was carried out.
Grafton was interviewed again at the Christchurch South Police Station four days later and signed a written statement repeating her claims.
"Subsequent police inquiries have revealed these allegations to be totally fabricated," said Mr Tualii. Grafton admitted lying, when she was interviewed again on February 28.
Judge Erber remanded her on bail for sentence on July 1.
Washington boasts of military buildup against China
3 June 2014
If anyone was fooled by the media analyses portraying President Barack Obama's speech at West Point last week as a turn toward “moderation” and “restraint,” or tempted to think that the World Socialist Web Site was exaggerating in describing the address as a blueprint for “permanent and global war in pursuit of the interests of the US financial elite,” they only need to read the bellicose tirade delivered by his defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, in Singapore on Saturday.
The occasion for Hagel's provocative speech was the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual meeting of Asia-Pacific defense ministers, together with their civilian and military chiefs of staff. The conference is ostensibly a forum for “dialogue” and “confidence building” aimed at furthering regional security and cooperation.
Instead, the Pentagon chief delivered an address that spelled out in detail the measures Washington is taking to build up its military power in the Asia Pacific for the purpose of encircling China while containing and rolling back its influence in the region.
In essence, Hagel's speech is a corollary to the May 28 commencement address given by Obama at West Point. Critics of the presentation at the US Military Academy have pointed out that, while the administration had announced its “pivot to Asia” as a strategic axis of US foreign policy, Obama made no mention of this turn in what had been billed as a major foreign policy speech.
In point of fact, Obama did touch on the essence of the so-called “pivot” in his address, making a series of menacing statements in relation to China and suggesting that Washington would have to prepare for a military response to its rising global rival.
He placed China in the same category as Russia, presenting the two countries as threats to regional peace and security. “China's economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors,” Obama declared.
He went on to describe the territorial disputes in the South and East China seas, which Washington has deliberately inflamed and turned into global flash points, accusing China of “regional aggression” that could “ultimately impact our allies, and could draw in our military.” And he vowed to back Southeast Asian governments in maritime disputes with China in the South China Sea.
Yet there was no mention of the “pivot,” no declaration of a new over-arching strategic turn by the US and its massive military machine to confront China in the Asian-Pacific theater. Instead, the president told the American people that the principal threat faced by the United States was “terrorism,” the same boogeyman that has been used to justify US aggression abroad since the beginning of the century. No doubt this lack of an explicit statement of US strategy in a major presidential speech was deliberate.
Hagel was asked directly by one of the participants at the conference in Singapore why Obama does not explain the “pivot” to the American people with the same forcefulness with which the defense secretary and other US officials promote it in Asia. The answer is obvious. The popular reaction to a public campaign in support of a policy of military provocation and aggression against a nuclear-armed China would be one of horror and virulent opposition. So, the thinking in ruling circles undoubtedly goes, better to lead the population unwittingly to the brink of a global conflagration than risk a political firestorm.
In the somewhat more discreet atmosphere of the Shangri-La Dialogue, Hagel felt under no such compunction. He positively boasted of the US military buildup in the region.
Hagel declared that the “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia “is not a goal, not a promise, or a vision—it's a reality.”
He pointed to the ten-year Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) reached between Washington and the corrupt Aquino regime in the Philippines offering Washington virtually unrestricted rights to deploy US military forces in that country.
Similarly, he touted the close alliance established between the Obama administration and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who heads up the most right-wing Japanese government in postwar history.
“Consider that just three years ago, the strength of our alliance with Japan was being overshadowed by disagreement over the future of the US presence in Okinawa,” said Hagel. “Today [after a change in government that was pushed by Washington], we have a fully agreed force realignment map …We have also deployed our most advanced capabilities to Japan—including two Global Hawks at Misawa, F-22 fighter aircraft at Kadena, and MV-22 Ospreys on Okinawa.”
He also declared his full support for Abe's proposal to engage in a more “proactive” use of Japan's military, as the Japanese prime minister seeks to scrap the postwar constitution that was supposed to prevent a revival of Japanese militarism. US backing has served to underwrite Japan's increasingly provocative confrontations with China.
On the tense Korean Peninsula, Hagel added, the Pentagon has “enhanced the US Army's force posture and deployed even more advanced intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.” He also pointed to the deployment of more than 1,000 US Marines in Western Australia.
Hagel made a point of stressing Washington's increased military cooperation with India, saying the US welcomed “India's growing defense capabilities and its commitment to freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean.”
“In the coming years, the United States will increase its advanced capabilities that are forward-stationed and forward-deployed in the entire region, particularly as we draw down our forces in Afghanistan,” Hagel declared. “And we will ensure that we sustain our freedom of action in the face of disruptive new military technologies.” No one needed to ask what country might be deploying these “disruptive” weapons systems.
The defense secretary went on to detail a new arsenal of warships that will be deployed in the region over the next four years, including the new Joint High Speed Vessel, another nuclear-armed submarine stationed in Guam, four Littoral Combat Ships and the Zumwalt-class destroyer. The new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, he added, will be sold to Japan, South Korea and Australia. By 2020, Hagel said, the US will have 60 percent of both its Navy and Air Force fleets operating in the region. He added that the Obama administration has pledged that no cuts in military spending will come out of the Asia-Pacific buildup.
The speech left no doubt as to which country this arsenal is directed against. China, Hagel charged, “has undertaken destabilizing, unilateral actions asserting its claims in the South China Sea.” He accused it of using “intimidation, coercion, or the threat of force to assert those claims.” And, he vowed, Washington “will not look the other way when fundamental principles of the international order are being challenged.”
Hagel delivered an ultimatum to Beijing, declaring that China had “a choice: to unite and recommit to a stable regional order, or to walk away from that commitment and risk the peace and security that have benefited millions of people throughout the Asia-Pacific, and billions around the world.”
The meaning is clear enough. Either China submits to the post-World War II arrangements establishing US hegemony over the Asia-Pacific region, or it will face the direct threat of war with the United States.
The chief of the Chinese military, Wang Guanzhong, responded angrily to the speech delivered by Hagel as well as to a previous address by Japan's Prime Minister Abe, declaring them “unacceptable” and saying the two were singing “in chorus.” Hagel's speech, he said, was designed to “stoke instability… to pick fights and incite disputes and conflicts.”
US imperialism is seeking to encircle China militarily. Its aim is to utilize its residual military superiority to suppress economic and political challenges posed in Asia and on a world scale by the growth of China's economy. In the final analysis, its aim is to offload as much of the burden of the capitalist crisis that erupted in 2008-2009 onto its rivals, as it steps up the assault on the working class at home.
In Singapore, Hagel repeated Obama's statement in his West Point speech that “America must always lead on the world stage. If we don't, no one else will.”
In the conference discussion Sunday, Russia's Deputy Minister of Defense Anatoly Antonov raised a question: “For me it is not clear why the US must lead,” Antonov said. “To lead what? To where?”
No one should have any doubts. US imperialism is leading humanity to a new eruption of militarism that poses the ever graver threat of a nuclear Third World War.

Administrative: These are transactions that change signature requirements, add owners, remove owners, etc.
Minor Transactions: These are ether or token transfers below a set daily threshold.
Major Transactions: These are ether or token transfers at or above a set daily threshold.
Allows a major transaction threshold to be set individually for any token.
Provides a transaction hash for any pending transaction such as is implemented in Gav's wallet, allowing subsequent signatures to be submitted by hash.
Can create other contracts from within the wallet.
Any new token will automatically have a major threshold of 0 until a threshold is defined by the wallet owners.
Allows signatures to be revoked at any point in time prior to the transaction confirming.
The wallet is actually made up of our new wallet library family. The family consists of three libraries:
WalletMainLib: This is the main library used to create a wallet and initialize parameters. It contains the WalletData struct which should be placed in the storage of your wallet contract. This library also contains the primary transaction initiating, confirming, and revocation code. WalletAdminLib: This library contains all of the functionality to change the parameters of your multisig wallet such as adding owners, changing signature requirements, etc. WalletGetterLib: This library contains all of the getter functions for your wallet data.

IT IS another escalation in the computer security arms race. Software that can uncover all of a person's online activity could, in the hands of the police, put more sex offenders behind bars – but it may also be exploited to develop new ways of avoiding being caught.
Researchers from Stanford University in California have managed to bypass the encryption on a PC's hard drive to find out what websites a user has visited and whether they have any data stored in the cloud.
“Commercial forensic software concentrates on extracting files from a disc, but that's not super-helpful in understanding online activity,” says Elie Bursztein, whose team developed the software. “We've built a tool that can reconstruct where the user has been online, and what identity they used.” The open-source software, Offline Windows Analysis and Data Extraction (OWADE), was launched at the Black Hat 2011 security conference and works with PCs running on the Windows operating system.
We've built a tool that can reconstruct where the user has been online, and what identity they used

The majority of sensitive data on a hard drive, including browsing history, site logins and passwords, uses an algorithm to generate an encryption key based on the standard Windows login.
Last year, Bursztein and his colleagues discovered how this system works – making them the only team in the world, other than Microsoft, able to decrypt the files. Now the team have made their discovery public, with free access.
The OWADE software combines this new knowledge with existing data-extraction techniques to create a single package that can uncover illegal online activities.
“Say you're working on a paedophilia case and you might want to know if people had interactions with minors on social networking sites,” says Bursztein. Previously, with only access to a hard drive, the police would not be able to match suspects to online identities, let alone gain access to their accounts. “Now, law enforcement organisations can extract information from websites like Facebook to find out,” he says.
However, those intent on remaining anonymous could exploit the system. “If somebody knows what they're doing with their data, they will try and hide it and work around [solutions like this] as much as they can,” says John Haggerty from the University of Salford, UK.

EMPLOYEES in semi governmental organisations (SGO) are holding warning strikes on Tuesday and Wednesday to express their opposition to privatisation plans.
Cyprus telecommunications authority (CYTA) and Cyprus port authority (CPA) employees will go on strike today, while the electricity authority (EAC) employees are going on strike Wednesday.
The privatisations of SGOs were requested by the troika of lenders (European Central Bank, European Commission and the International Monetary Fund). Finance Minister Harris Georgiades said a week ago that the government will proceed with the privatisation plan, unless the unions can find another way of saving 1.4 billion euros. The minister jokingly added that the government would have to win the lottery for that to happen.
CyTA's one hour strike today will last from 1:15 pm until 2:15 pm. In a statement released to the press, CyTA unions say that their reason for going on strike is that the government is implementing “a privatisation plan without first briefing the employees”. CyTA unions made clear that no services will be affected by the strike.
CPA employees will strike today, from 9:00 to 11:00
Cyprus port authority unions are demanding that the SGO be excluded from the privatisation proposal. “The goal of the workers is to avert privatisations and to preserve the national wealth and the public interest,” a statement released to the press said. “If we move towards that direction we will give to private interests state revenue and millions in CPA investments.”
The Cyprus electricity authority (EAC) unions met on Friday and decided that they will proceed with a two hour warning strike on Wednesday. The EAC unions' rhetoric mirrors that of their colleagues in the other two SGO.
In a letter sent to EAC manager Stelios Stylianou, the four unions (EPOPAI, SIDIKEK, SEPAIK and SIVAIK) say that they made every effort to convince finance minister Harris Georgiades on the “negative impact a possible privatisation of EAC will have on the economy, the citizens and society in general” but didn't get any results.
“We are saddened that in spite the severity of this issue, there has been a veil of secrecy when it comes to dealings regarding the privatisation. We are against privatisations because we are sure that it will have minimal impact on the island's dire financial situation,” their statement said.
“We have a moral obligation to defend our country's economy and the national resources of our semi-occupied state for future generations,” they said.
Unions said that their intention was not to inconvenience people, so essential personnel will be excluded from the strike.

Hey e-cig smokers, it turns out you can't have your cake and eat it too. Scientists have found that vaping can suppress your immune system, even compares to those who smoke regular cigarettes.
According to Ars Technica, researchers swabbed the noses of smokers, vapers, and non tobacco users alike, and found that vaping was suppressing 358 genes involved in the immune system of those who use e-cigarettes. Don't tell that to Leonardo DiCaprio, though. Compared to non-smokers, those who smoked (whether e-cigarettes or regular cigarettes) had 53 immune system genes compromised.
The researchers are still studying what exactly this means for those who vape, but that it probably indicates an unbalanced, compromised immune system. In follow-up studies, they tested the effects of the e-cig liquid on two types of immune system cells that eat up bacteria. They found that putting these sells into the solution compromised their ability to absorb harmful microbes. In testing e-cigarette flavors, they found out that cinnamon and butter flavors likely has the worst effect in suppressing immune system genes.
So, this probably deals a blow to those who think that e-cigarettes are safer than regular ones. While regular ones are plenty unsafe, it seems like vaping can be bad for your health in different ways.

BALASORE: India is set to test its indigenously developed intercontinental surface-to-surface nuclear capable ballistic missile Agni-V from the Wheeler Island off Odisha coast on Monday.Range co-ordination has reached its final stage for the fourth test of Agni-V missile, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) sources said.If everything goes according to plan, the missile may be test-fired Monday, they said.The three stage, solid propellant missile is to be test-fired from a mobile launcher from the launch complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR), the sources said.It will be fourth developmental and second canisterised trial of the long range missile. While the first test was conducted on April 19, 2012, the second test was carried out on September 15, 2013 and the third on January 31, 2015 from the same base.The indigenously-developed surface-to-surface missile, Agni-V, is capable of striking a target more than 5,000 km. It is about 17-metre long, 2-metre wide and has launch weight of around 50 tonnes. The missile can carry a nuclear warhead of more than one tonne.Unlike other missiles of Agni series, the latest one Agni-V is the most advanced having some new technologies incorporated in terms of navigation and guidance, warhead and engine.Lot of new technologies developed indigenously were successfully tested in the first Agni-V trial. The redundant navigation systems, very high accuracy Ring Laser Gyro based Inertial Navigation System (RINS) and the most modern and accurate Micro Navigation System (MINS) had ensured the Missile reach the target point within few metres of accuracy.The high-speed onboard computer and fault tolerant software along with robust and reliable bus guided the missile flawlessly, an official said.India has at present in its armoury of Agni series, Agni-I with 700 km range, Agni-II with 2,000 km range, Agni-III and Agni-IV with 2,500 km to more than 3500 km range. After some few more trials, Agni-V will be inducted into the services, sources said.

The Circular Key: Socialism, realism and subtextual Marxism
Catherine Finnis
Department of Deconstruction, University of California, Berkeley
1. Semantic desublimation and Marxist capitalism
“Society is unattainable,” says Bataille. Lacan suggests the use of precultural patriarchial theory to deconstruct sexual identity.
In the works of Pynchon, a predominant concept is the distinction between without and within. But in Vineland, Pynchon examines realism; in Mason & Dixon, however, he denies Marxist capitalism. The primary theme of Long's[1] analysis of postconceptualist appropriation is the role of the writer as reader.
“Class is part of the fatal flaw of language,” says Sartre. Therefore, the subject is interpolated into a Batailleist `powerful communication' that includes art as a whole. The characteristic theme of the works of Fellini is the bridge between sexual identity and class.
If one examines Batailleist `powerful communication', one is faced with a choice: either accept realism or conclude that sexual identity, perhaps ironically, has intrinsic meaning, given that consciousness is interchangeable with narrativity. Thus, la Fournier[2] states that we have to choose between the textual paradigm of context and prematerialist narrative. Sontag promotes the use of Marxist capitalism to attack hierarchy.
In the works of Fellini, a predominant concept is the concept of patriarchial consciousness. However, Foucault uses the term ‘Batailleist `powerful communication” to denote not, in fact, materialism, but neomaterialism. The main theme of von Ludwig's[3] model of realism is the stasis, and some would say the economy, of textual society.
Therefore, if Batailleist `powerful communication' holds, the works of Fellini are modernistic. Realism holds that discourse must come from the masses.
Thus, Lacan uses the term ‘Marxist capitalism' to denote a mythopoetical paradox. Foucault suggests the use of realism to read and challenge class.
However, Cameron[4] suggests that we have to choose between Marxist capitalism and subcapitalist modernist theory. In The Island of the Day Before, Eco reiterates realism; in The Aesthetics of Thomas Aquinas he denies Marxist capitalism.
It could be said that if Derridaist reading holds, we have to choose between Batailleist `powerful communication' and predialectic capitalism. The subject is contextualised into a realism that includes truth as a whole.
Thus, any number of constructions concerning Marxist capitalism may be found. The example of realism which is a central theme of Eco's The Name of the Rose emerges again inFoucault's Pendulum, although in a more self-justifying sense.
However, Foucault uses the term ‘Marxist capitalism' to denote not narrative per se, but subnarrative. The characteristic theme of the works of Eco is the common ground between class and culture.
Thus, Marx promotes the use of the cultural paradigm of consensus to deconstruct capitalism. Several constructivisms concerning a neodialectic reality exist.

Whether you drive for twenty minutes, take public transportation for an hour or walk a few blocks to your workplace, you spend a significant time of your day getting to and from work. Why not maximize what you do with that time, so that by the time you get to work your day is already supercharged with productivity? Chances are the way your morning goes will alter the rest of your day, and the way you feel on your afternoon commute will affect the way you are at home in the evening. It's important that you don't let your commute go to waste - doing things that maximize the day's potential will positively impact everything you do that day. Not sure what you can do while making your way to work? I've put together a few ideas to get you started.
Do some breathing exercises
I'm not suggesting you do a full blown yoga class on the bus, but a simple breathing exercise can really energize you and clear your mind. The more stress we have in our life, the less we focus on our breathing, yet, paradoxically, breathing has many benefits that can counteract the effects of stress. All you need to do is focus on your breathing and try to make your exhales longer than your inhales (example, inhale for a count of 2 and exhale for a count of 4). Depending on where you are, you can also close your eyes, if you'd feel more relaxed that way.
Read
This one seems obvious, but it's worth mentioning. Maybe there's a novel you've been wanting to read for a while, or you simply want to catch up on the latest in the business world. The thing about reading on your commute is that you have many media to choose from: a book, a magazine, your tablet, your cellphone, etc. My advice is picked something different every week. Sticking with it for a week will produce results, but switching it up weekly will offer some novelty to your commute. If, like me, you commute for more than an hour daily, you will soon be able to say that you read a book every a week.
Listen to audio books
For those that drive, there is no reason to look over the written word. You can find many free audio books that you can easily download and listen to in your car. From literature to non-fiction, you can find pretty much anything you're looking for has been adapted to an audio book.
Catch up with family and friends
Make the time you spend commuting time well-spent by catching up with family and friends. Having good relationships with those around you will translate in a number of benefits for you, including the potential for increased productivity at work. Whether you call, email or text staying in touch while commuting is probably one of the most valuable things you can do with your time. Just make sure to wear a headset if you're driving!
Read the news
Many skeptics say that reading the news is a waste of time, that you don't really need to know what's going on somewhere else in the world, and that if it impacts you in any way, you will eventually find out. Yes, you might find out, but it might be too late for you to do anything about it. You want to know what's going on in your community and the world at large, because that can not only affect your personal life, but also your business. Stay informed while commuting by reading the newspapers, news magazines or listening to the radio. What's more, you can get all of that straight onto your phone or tablet.
Plan
Planning the tasks you want to complete for the day is a very good use of your commute time. Especially, think about the bigger picture and what small steps you can take to get there. When you come into the office knowing exactly what you want to get done for the day it can really improve your performance. Stepping into your office with a feeling of purpose is essential for productivity. Otherwise, you may just get lost in menial tasks.
Get a jump start on the day's work
Is there any work that you can do on your commute? Can you draft respond to emails or edit and proofread a report? Whatever you can do on your commute, get it done and out of the way.
Listen to podcasts
Listening to a podcast can be a great way to improve your knowledge base. Maybe you want to brush off your French or Spanish. Whether it's art, history or science that you're trying to learn more about, there's really no limit to what kind of podcasts you can find. Podcasts can really help you acquire knowledge in a bite-sized package.
Play a game
Sometimes it's also good to just have fun on your commute. Playing a game on your phone, tablet or the gaming device of your choice can really boost confidence and positivity. There's something to be said about achieving small tasks, even when they're not work related.
Avoid rush hour
Most commutes are not that bad, but they're made a lot worse by rush hour. You can probably cut down a significant chunk of your commute time by getting to work a little bit earlier or later, when traffic is not that congested. Traffic gets really heavy after 8 am, so leaving just 15 or 30 minutes before that can really improve your commute. If you have a more flexible schedule, then leaving your house a bit later is also an option.

Echo Mountain ski area — the small ski hill 35 miles from downtown Denver that has enjoyed robust growth since opening six years ago — is for sale in an auction scheduled for early August.
“We've had six years of steady growth,” said owner Jerry Petitt, the Maryland hotelier who bought the 226-acre dormant Squaw Pass ski area at a 2002 auction for $700,000 and has since plowed several million dollars into developing the area. “But to reach the next level, Echo needs investment and expansion. And it's time for new ownership to take it to that next level.”
Under Petitt, Echo Mountain has grown from 12,000 visits in its inaugural 2005-06 season to 32,000 last season. Just about every resort in the country limped through the 2011-12 ski season — the worst in two decades nationally for both snowfall and visitation. But Echo had decent snow and saw strong visitation, with revenue climbing 30 percent and daily ticket sales up 50 percent.
“It was a record year for us overall,” said Petitt, chief executive of the 14-team summer collegiate baseball Coastal Plain League who has bought and sold hotels across the country for decades.
The Denver office of international auction firm Sheldon Good & Co. is handling the sale. The firm offers swift sales and moves 90 percent of its listings, said chief executive Mark Troen.
“We get the deal done,” Troen said.
Without discussing a price, Petitt said: “Our whole aim is to get it sold, but we are not going to give it away either.”
“I asked the auction people what they think and it's a wide range. The market sets the price so it's hard to say what it's going to sell for,” said Petitt, who will not close the ski area if bidders do not reach his undisclosed reserve price in the sealed bid auction.
The market for ski resorts is sporadic, especially in today's troubled economic climate, which has pinched commercial real estate.
Recent ski-resort sales cover a broad range. Jackson Hole's Storm King and Utah's Brian Head have been on the market for more than a year. Last August, the Powderhorn ski area atop the Grand Mesa sold at auction for a paltry $1.4 million in a deal that included 600 developable acres. Vail Resorts picked up Lake Tahoe's venerable and relatively expansive Kirkwood ski area in February for $18 million. Florida real estate investment trust CNL grabbed Washington's uber-snowy Stevens Pass for $20.5 million last fall.
It's a tough market, with almost no consensus in terms of pricing a ski area, said Mike Cahill, whose Greenwood Village-based Hospitality Real Estate Counselors specializes in commercial real estate and is listing Jackson's 465-acre Storm King ski area, which includes a 204-room hotel, for an undisclosed price.
“Almost all ski resorts make their money off residential real estate sales,” Cahill said. “Without real estate it places the buyer dependent on just the ski industry.”
But skiing has worked for Echo. The hill straddling Squaw Pass has developed a loyal following as it evolved from pure terrain park to family-centric ski hill.
Troen and Petitt will trumpet the opportunities for Echo as they reach out to ski-industry veterans, resorts looking to expand their offerings and investors. The area's summertime potential is ripe for expansion and the ski area could more than double its vertical drop.
“This will be valued not just on its tangibles but also its intangibles,” said Troen, who noted the parcel could host some residential development. “Not only by what the ownership has put in place but what the new ownership can add to that.”
Petitt has built parking lots, two base-area buildings, three lifts and 16 trails on 80 acres of the 226-acre parcel, which boasts top-tier snowmaking and lights for night skiing. His team has developed only a third of the parcel, opening the opportunity to expand its 660 feet of vertical to 1,500 feet.
Bids in the sealed auction are due Aug. 2. More information can be found at echomtnauction.com.

As Senate considers climate law, report says desert solar farms can be as cheap as coal by 2025
US could become leader in desert solar, says IEA
The United States could position itself as the global leader in producing utility-scale solar power from its vast deserts, with immediate and appropriate government support, a new report from the International Energy Agency says.
The study by the Paris–based energy policy adviser for developed nations says with R&D backing, adoption of feed-in tariffs and binding renewable energy portfolio standards, the U.S. and other sunny nations could accelerate the cost reductions needed for widespread deployment of concentrating solar power (CSP) plants.
"This decade is crucial for effective policies," said Nubuo Tanaka, executive director of IEA.
With incentives in place, investment costs for solar farms could drop by 30 to 40 percent by 2020, the energy agency, known for its conservative predictions, said.
As the Senate considers new climate law, at least one thing is certain in the U.S.: There is no lack of available land. The deserts of the Southwest could theoretically power the entire nation.
Currently, solar provides less than one percent of America's electricity supply, with about half of that coming from CSP installations. The 30-year-old CSP technology is proven. It has been generating electricity in California since the 1980s. Unlike photovoltaics, which turn the sun's rays directly into electricity in panels, CSP uses arrays of often hundreds of mirrors to magnify sunlight. The massive mirrors concentrate the sun's energy hundreds of times to generate steam in a boiler that spins a turbine.
The IEA also expects the industry to solve the problem of nightfall. The 50-page report says CSP plants will be able to produce electricity around the clock in the "not-too-distant future" — even when clouds close in or the sun sets — thanks to emerging thermal storage technologies that will allow "solar plants to compete with fossil-fuel plants."
Storage technologies will amass power accumulated during daylight hours so it can be released at night or dispatched to the national electrical grid at peak periods.
"The firm capacity and flexibility of CSP plants will help grid operators integrate larger amounts of variable renewable electricity such as solar PV and wind power," Tanaka said.
As with wind farms on remote Midwestern praires, however, huge investments in long-distance electricity transmission would eventually be needed to carry the clean electricity from far-off deserts to city centers.
But ultimately, it is installation costs that will determine whether CSP technology takes off, or not.
IEA says if building costs falls as predicted, CSP would achieve grid parity by 2020 in peak and intermediate loads. For baseload power, CSP would be as cheap as coal between 2025 and 2030.
But that assumes a lot — an increase in competition, a growth in plant size, the mass production of equipment, an improvement in technology improves and a policy to put a global price on carbon.
Most importantly, though, the financial community would have to gain confidence in CSP.
Even with strong government programs, "financing of CSP plants may become difficult if investors in technology companies do not supply some equity capitalists," the report said.
Spain Leads, For Now
While other governments and the private sector have been slow to support CSP in recent years, Spain has moved ahead on its own.
Spain has taken a leading role globally in promoting solar power and other forms of renewable energy," Tanaka said, at the launch of the report in Valencia this week.
In 2005, the Spanish government passed a feed-in tariff aimed at CSP development. Because of the subsidy, the nation now has over 20 projects under construction with 1,000 megawatts of capacity that could go online by the end of this year. The country's eight operational facilities were all completed in the last two years.
It was the U.S., though, that first eyed CSP with great interest in the 1980s. And a revival is now underway.
From 1984 to 1991, the first CSP plants in the world began operating in California, fueled by federal and state tax incentives and mandatory power purchase contracts. But as fossil fuel costs dropped, so did the political will to advance clean power.
But now CSP is gaining steam in Washington once again, spurred by climate change and foreign energy dependency concerns. The U.S. Department of Energy has set an objective under its CSP research program to reach price competitiveness with dirty fuels by 2015, well ahead of EIA targets.
In February — in the government's boldest stroke yet — DOE offered BrightSource energy, an Oakland-based CSP company, nearly $1.4 billion in loan guarantees for its 400-megawatt Ivanpah CSP system. The facility is expected to be the world's largest solar project and the first CSP installation in nearly two decades. This month, DOE awarded $62 million in R&D dollars to CSP start-ups eSolar, Abengoa, Infinia and SkyFuel to help bring advanced technologies to market.
All the while, demand for CSP is continuing at record rates.
In California alone, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has received requests for the development of 34 CSP plants on 300,000 acres, totaling some 24,000 megawatts, according to figures from the California Energy Commission. In early 2010, the stock of CSP projects worldwide was only around a thousand megawatts, according to IEA.
The pace of the permitting process remains a hurdle in the U.S., though. In California, environmental analyses on federal or state land can take 18 to 24 months.
To help tackle the problem, BLM has pledgd to streamline procedures for obtaining permits for CSP plants and access lines, with 11 CSP projects now under fast-track review for approval by December 2010.
Worldwide: 11% by 2050
Globally, CSP could provide 11 .3% of global electricity by mid-century, IEA says.
While North America will be the largest producing and consuming region under this scenario, Africa, India and the Middle East are all expected to be major players.
Currently, Algeria, some Indian states, Israel and South Africa, all have feed-in tariffs or premium payments in place for CSP projects.
Northern Africa, in particular, has the potential to be a considerable CSP exporter to Europe. According to IEA, the region's "high solar resource largely compensates for the additional cost of long transmission lines."
Indeed, the biggest game changer for CSP would be the success of the Desertec initiative. The ambitious, $50 billion plan aims to build vast solar farms in the Sahara and export the electricity via high-voltage direct current transmission lines to power 15 percent of Europe by 2050.
While building the high-voltage cables remains a technological and financial challenge, IEA says at least some of the incentives to make the project affordable are already in place.
Hiro and his lovable robot Baymax. Disney "Big Hero 6" takes home the Oscar for best animated feature film.
This marks Disney's seventh win in the past eight years for best animated picture.
Walt Disney Animation was responsible for last year's massive Oscar-winning hit "Frozen."
"Big Hero 6," which follows Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and his robot cohort Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit), was a big hit for the studio, grossing $521.2 million worldwide.
Earlier this year, fans and much of Hollywood were surprised by the snub of Warner Bros.' "The Lego Movie" from the animated category, leaving a clear path for "Big Hero 6" to take home the award.
The picture beat out "How to Train Your Dragon 2," "The Boxtrolls," "Song of The Sea," and "The Tale of Princess Kaguya."
The film was directed by Don Hall and Chris Williams.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — With the Winter Games underway in Sochi, Google Inc. quietly but vibrantly added its voice Thursday to the chorus of U.S. companies speaking out against Russia's law restricting gay-rights activities by updating its iconic search page logo to depict illustrations of athletes skiing, sledding, curling and skating against a rainbow-colored backdrop.
The company declined to comment on the new Google Doodle that appeared on its home pages worldwide, saying it wanted the illustration to speak for itself. But the logo clearly was meant as a show of support for gay rights and a rebuke of the law that bans pro-gay "propaganda" that could be accessible to minors: below the updated logo appears a two-sentence section of the Olympic charter that reads, in part, "The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practicing sport, without discrimination of any kind."
"Google has made a clear and unequivocal statement that Russia's anti-LGBT discrimination is indefensible," said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, whose Washington-based group has been lobbying American corporations, especially those sponsoring the Games in Sochi, to condemn the law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in July. "Now it's time for each and every remaining Olympic sponsor to follow their lead. The clock is ticking, and the world is watching."
Although Google is not an Olympics sponsor, its action came a day after three sponsors of the U.S. Olympic Committee — AT&T, DeVry University and yogurt maker Chobani — issued statements explicitly speaking out against the Russian law.
Google typically updates its themed daily Doodles at midnight Eastern time, but the Olympics-gay pride version made its debut in the late afternoon. While Google is not as popular in Russia as it is in the U.S., the timing meant it would be seen in Russia on Friday, when the Games' opening ceremonies will be held. The local time in Sochi is 12 hours ahead of California, where Google is headquartered.
Google and its founders have been outspoken supporters of gay rights since 2008, when the company got involved in the campaign to defeat a gay marriage ban on the California ballot. In 2012 it launched a global workplace safety campaign, called "Legalise Love," that it described as a call to decriminalize homosexuality and eliminate homophobia around the world. The company also recognizes gay pride season each year by customizing search boxes to turn rainbow-colored when terms like "gay" and "gay pride" are entered.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Michael Brantley was asked just how much running his right ankle will tolerate.
"I can get to first base, second base, third base and home," said Brantley. "That's all I need to do and that's what I can do."
The Indians activated Brantley on Saturday. He made a pinch-hitting appearance in the fifth inning a few hours later. He dueled White Sox right-hander Carson Fulmer through a 10-pitch at-bat that ended in a single to right. It was his first at-bat since Aug. 8 when he injured his ankle while playing left field.
The sellout crowd gave Brantley a standing ovation as he came to the plate.
"It was very much appreciated. It gave me chills. It gave me goosebumps," said Brantley. "To hear that crowd as they stood up, and remembering how hard you've worked to come back each time you get injured, it was very much appreciated.
"Anytime you get a standing ovation from people you care about, it means a lot."
In Sunday's season finale, Brantley pinch-hit for Edwin Encarnacion and grounded out twice, as the Indians beat the White Sox, 3-1, for their 102nd victory in the regular season finale. It's the second most wins by the Indians in franchise history.
As for speculation that Brantley will be added to the AL Division Series roster, Brantley said, "That's up to management and Tito. They're going to make the best decision for this team. That's all I care about is winning games. Whatever they decide is out of my control."
Brantley missed the postseason last year because of surgery on his right shoulder. Could an ankle injury keep him on the bench this year as well?
"It is what it is," said Brantley. "I can only do so much. I'm only human. I understand I got hurt. It happens. I missed it last year. I don't want to miss if this year if I can. If I have to, I have to.
"All I care about is this team winning ballgames. I'll never change that attitude. It's a team first approach around here for everybody. Whatever roster gives us the best chance to win, I'm all for it."
The Indians open the ALDS on Thursday at Progressive Field. They will face the winner of Tuesday's wild-card game between New York and the Twins at Yankee Stadium.
They will have an informal workout on Monday. On Tuesday, they will work out again with Ryan Merritt throwing a simulated game against the Tribe's regulars. Brantley will be fully engaged as he tries to convince the Indians that he's ready to help them Indians in the ALDS.
On Wednesday the Indians their opponent in the ALDS will workout at Progressive Field in the final preparation before Game 1 on Thursday. A time for the game has yet to be set.
"It would mean a lot to make the roster," said Brantley. "But as I said before it's whatever management wants. I'm not pulling one way or the other. I'm going to go out there and do my job to the best of my ability if I'm on there. If not, I'm going to be the biggest cheerleader I can be. The most important thing is that we win baseball games."
According to gender role theory, women's greater emotional intensity than men's stems from normative expectations for sex differences that arise as a result of men's and women's social roles. In the 1st experiment, endorsement of normative expectations for sex differences was associated with sex differences in Ss' own emotions: To the extent that they endorsed stereotypical differences between men and women, female Ss reported personally experiencing emotions of greater intensity and male Ss reported experiencing emotions of lesser intensity. The 2nd study manipulated expectations for responsiveness while Ss viewed a series of emotion-inducing slides. When instructions rendered normative expectations comparable for men and women, no sex differences were obtained in emotion self-reports. Furthermore, women evidenced more extreme electromyograph physiological responding than men, suggesting general sex differences in emotion that are not limited to self-report.

Newly leaked packaging for the iPhone 7 Plus allegedly reveals that the device will ship with new 'AirPods Wireless Earphones'.
Two pictures of a what appears to be a retail box for the iPhone 7 Plus in Hungary were posted earlier today by AppleInsider. The box indicates that it includes: iPhone 7 Plus, AirPods Wireless Earphones, Lightning to USB Cable, and USB Power Adapter.
This differs from another recently leaked spec sheet from Hong Kong which had the box including: iPhone 7 Plus, EarPods with Lightning Connector, Lightning to Headphone Jack Adapter, Lightning to USB Cable, and USB Power Adapter.
If we presume that these labels are not fake, it appears that Apple will offer the option of wireless or wired earphones with the purchase of a new iPhone 7.
Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 7 on September 7th. Please follow iClarified on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, or RSS for updates.

The Long Beach Press-Telegram newspaper, which also covers Seal Beach, Artesia and, Cerritos, circulated a letter Sunday to its subscribers asking that they fight to stop the closing of the photo, arts and entertainment and sports departments.
"Al Rudis, our sole remaining features writer to cover all the region's arts and entertainment issues, has been told his position has been eliminated and that the Breeze's features staff, a department of two people, will now cover the South Bay and Long Beach and its surrounding communities," reads the email, sent by the Southern California Media Guild
"At least one photographer and one sports writer will be laid off as well," reads the email.
The organization asks the public to go to the advocacy group's, Save The Press-Telegram Facebook page and press the "Like" button.
The group will also be at the Long Beach City Council meeting Tuesday.
To varying degrees, Seal Beach has been a part of The Press-Telegram's coverage area for decades. The paper's Seal Beach reporter Joe Segura has been with the paper for decades and is well known in the community.
The Press-Telegram is just the latest of the local papers to announce cutbacks. For years, The Press-Telegram, The Orange County Register and the Los Angeles Times have had several rounds of layoffs. In 2009, The Orange County Register's parent company emerged from bankruptcy, and for months, the parent companies of The Press-Telegram and the Los Angeles Times have been rumored to be the two likely winners in a bid to buy the Register. Last year, the Los Angeles Times' parent company, The Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy. Even the Leisure World News has struggled of late, having announced a reduction in pages several months ago.
The media guild's complete letter is reprinted below:
Dear reader,
Your local newspaper is under attack again.
The Press-Telegram, which has served the Greater Long Beach area for more than 100 years, is going to lose its entire Photo, Sports and Arts & Entertainment departments at the end of this month.
As of June 30, all of the newspaper's photographers and sports writers will be moved to the Daily Breeze in Torrance.
At least one photographer and one sports writer will be laid off as well. No local photographers, sports writers and arts and entertainment writers means far less coverage of issues important to our readers and crucial for our community.
This move will not only drastically affect our ability to respond to breaking news it will also cut into the number of scheduled events -- from high school sports to the symphony -- that can be covered given the logistics.
That also means less time for good news stories and features about the latest community offerings for youth, seniors, singles and families. If you care about your local paper and your community please take the time to let those in charge know the city of Long Beach and its surrounding communities of Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, Lakewood, Norwalk, Paramount and Seal Beach deserve a real newspaper with its own staff, a staff that has served this area for generations and knows its history.
You can help by liking our Facebook page, Save the Press-Telegram, and sharing it with those you know.

If there's one thing Disney fans like, it's discovering Easter eggs in their favorite Disney movies. Since we always want to make you guys happy, we're back with a third installment (here's one and two) of our series of articles that points out particularly clever hidden gems in Disney classics new and old.
1. Magic Carpet From Aladdin in The Princess and the Frog.
Do you guys think it flew all the way from Agrabah to New Orleans?
2. The Incredible Mr. Limpet in The Little Mermaid.
The glasses should have clued us in to this on years ago.
3. Pinocchio and Pumbaa in Tangled.
We really like that Pumbaa seems have acquired a nose ring. So early '00s.
4. Directors Ron Clements and Jon Musker in Hercules.
These prolific Disney directors usually show up somewhere in their awesome films, this rendition is particularly awesome.
5. Peg from Lady and the Tramp in One Hundred and One Dalmatians.
Disney dogs unite!
6. Hans in Big Hero 6.
We like to think that the San Fransokyo police are somehow in touch with the authorities in Arendelle.
7. Bambi and his Mother in The Rescuers.
We've probably never noticed thing because it's hard to see Easter eggs through our tears, which are always flowing during this part of the movie.
Which Easter egg is your favorite? Tell us in the comments!

Aggrieved complainants in the "fewer Moroccans" case against Geert Wilders will not be able to count on legal aid. The Legal Aid Council recently rejected the requests submitted by the lawyers acting on behalf of dozens of Moroccan complainants.
The Council decided that the case was not complex enough and the complainants would have no direct interest, which is a requirement for a so-called addition, the Telegraaf reports.
Lawyers Yehudi Moszkowicz and Goran Sluiter, who act on behalf of some of the complainants, are completely baffled by the Council's decision. Moszkowicz called the fact that the Council can't see the importance of the case incomprehensible. "There are six thousand and fifteen reports against Wilders' statements. How can you ignore that?" he said to the newspaper. Sluiter called the decision "completely unacceptable.
The lawyers will appeal against the decision.
In 1970, an American economist named George Akerlof published a paper on information asymmetry. Titled ‘The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism', it examined the market impact of a situation in which one party has more or better information than the other during a transaction.
To illustrate such a scenario, Akerlof turned to the market for used cars. In such a market, a seller has all the relevant information on the true quality of the car s/he wants to sell, while the buyer has none. Unaware of how well the car has been maintained, whether it has had hard knocks and bears hidden problems, and thus afraid he might get ripped off, the buyer will pay less than what a truly high-quality car deserves. Average prices tend to rule, so dud ‘lemons' are sold for what they're worth or more, while good ‘peach' cars are cheated of a fair resale price. If this is the case, then good cars will simply not find their way to the used car market, since their sellers cannot get a good deal. And so all the cars on sale would be duds. Assymetric information, Akerlof argued, could result in a market failure. His work won him the Nobel Prize for Economics in 2001.
However, on the other side of the globe, Mumbai's tiny Parsi community has been defying Akerlof's theory for decades. The used car market in India likely has more lemons than peaches, buyers remain equally blind while making a choice, but one type of used vehicle fetches a premium over all others—one owned and maintained by a Parsi.
Here in the city, newspaper classifieds for used cars often state ‘Parsi-owned' upfront, a mention almost always made ahead of the brand name and model of the vehicle. And popular internet portals like Quickr and OLX have reams of web pages with used cars on sale that highlight how they are ‘Parsi-owned', how they are in ‘immaculate condition' and how they are looking for ‘an owner to take care of their car'. A glance at these portals even reveals used cars that were once owned by a Parsi, have changed several other hands since and yet flaunt their ‘Parsi-owned' label.
It all points to the extraordinary demand for cars owned by Parsis. While most vehicles collect dust for weeks before a buyer is found, these get sold within days of going on sale. Just what makes Parsi car ownership so special?
Freddie Turel, a Parsi well known for his passion of collecting cars, lifts his large right arm in the air, points his index finger to his head and proceeds to unscrew an imaginary screw in his head. “Because,” he says by way of explanation, “we [Parsis] are mad about our cars.”
Often noticed for their eccentricities, Parsis love their cars so much, it's hard to exaggerate the phenomenon. Some say it goes with a manic need for orderliness, and the care they take of their automobiles has found portrayal in several commercials and Hindi films over the years. It all adds up to a higher sticker price.
Ayaaz Fazulbhoy, director of one of Mumbai's largest and oldest used car dealers, the 1956-established Fazulbhoys Motors, says that every Parsi-owned vehicle brought to his dealership for sale undergoes a different valuation process. He claims that a vehicle owned by a Parsi commands about 20 per cent more money than an equally well kept non-Parsi-owned vehicle of the same make, model and age. “When buyers come, they want to see the vehicles first,” says Fazulbhoy, “When they zero in on a car, after looking at its condition and checking their budgets, they start inquiring about its past owners. Some even ask, ‘Is it Parsi owned?'”
Apart from such cars, according to Fazulbhoy, vehicles owned by doctors also fetch an equally good price. According to another used car dealer, Saeed Rafique, manager of Evershine Motors in Andheri, people by nature are wary of the condition of used cars no matter what dealers say of their road fitness. “In our world, there are no guarantees of quality or a warranty period,” he says, “There is just the word of a dealer or seller. Trust, here, becomes crucial. People are willing to pay more for a vehicle owned by a Parsi or doctor because people of these two communities are thought to be trustworthy and careful.”
But is all this just imagery? Popular culture has long celebrated the image of a Parsi gentleman polishing an already polished car, burying his head under a car's hood to sniff out the faintest of noises, or swearing at others for failing to maintain road etiquette. Is it just another social stereotype?
On an earlier occasion, speaking over the phone, Turel had made the priority that Parsis accord their cars clear. “You see,” he had loudly declared, “we love our cars more than our wives.” This was before he dropped his voice to a whisper, “She is listening.” He elaborated on the theme a few days later at his Dadar residence. “It is like the case of the wife and the mistress. We marry our wives, but it is really the mistress we care for.”
Turel is popular among automobile enthusiasts in Mumbai. He collects vehicles, especially older cars, holds the position of vice-president of the Mercedes-Benz Club India, and at any given time, has at least a dozen vehicles in his possession. Just as he took over and expanded the dental care equipment business that his father set up, he has also inherited and expanded his father's passion for automobiles. In his time, his father owned a Pontiac Firebird, Peugeot 404 and a 1974 Fiat. As a boy, Freddie was not allowed to touch any of them, and some of his fondest memories are of older days when he was allowed to drive the cars to refuel. He would drive the car in need of fuel all the way from their home in Dadar to a filling station in Worli, and not any of the nearby ones because the owner of the Worli station was a Parsi, acquainted with the family, and thus trustworthy.
Turel often purchases neglected old cars, brings them up to scratch, and sells them when he wants to buy another. More often than not, he gets a higher value for these than what he bought them for. For instance, in the late 1970s, he got about Rs 4 lakh for a Mercedes sedan a few years after he bought it for Rs 3 lakh and spent a few thousand to refurbish it. “I know there are many who eye my cars,” he says, “but they don't dare ask if I want to sell them.”
Many Parsis, it appears, take a quirky approach to car maintenance. Captain RH Buhariwala, a former pilot in the armed forces who work with the Maharashtra government, never allows anyone else into the driver's seat of his Ford Fiesta. Nor has he ever employed a driver, who, he fears, might ruin his car. He gets his vehicle washed, cleaned and vacuumed religiously every day, even if it hasn't been driven, and never with a shampoo or detergent, afraid that it might contain chemicals that will corrode its paint. He does not allow any eatable in his car, a rule he does not relax even for his two school- going daughters.
Turel avoids visiting restaurants that have a valet service to park his car. If he cannot escape a valet, he asks the fellow to sit with him and show him the parking spot (and tips him anyway).
Captain Buhariwala has just listed his Fiesta for sale on OLX with a headline saying ‘Parsi owned car for sale'. When I turn up to meet him a little before noon in a spacious Parsi neighbourhood in Bandra, I find him inspecting his maroon car, already washed this morning, with a sponge in hand. Around him, old Parsi gentlemen circumambulate their cars under a hot sun, checking for faults to busy themselves with for the rest of the day, even as their wives seem to roll their eyes sitting in the cool shade.
“See,” says Captain Buhariwala, opening his car's doors, “This is how you know whether a car has ever undergone an accident.” He is referring to that part of the vehicle where the doors meet the rest of the frame. Smash-ups are often masked by having the exterior reworked, he says, but these points reveal the damage.
Captain Buhariwala's vehicle is over four years old and has been driven for 31,000 km. When he approached a dealer, he was offered only Rs 1.5 lakh for it. Confident that he could get a better price, he went online with his sale notice. His asking price: Rs 3 lakh. He admits that the same model of the same age and mileage used by anyone else would sell for just about Rs 2.5 lakh. “I have sold two other cars in the past too (a Fiat and an Indica),” he says, “and I've always got the quoted price.” Earlier, he would put up a notice with the sign ‘Parsi-owned car on sale' on his housing society's noticeboard and someone would show up with an offer within days. Online, so far, since he put up his notice two weeks ago, he has gotten around 30 inquiries. Some would-be buyers have even come home to see his Fiesta. He plans to sell it towards the end of the month and buy a new Mahindra SUV.
As I leave, he tells an unusual story of an old neighbour who owns an old Norton bike. This individual apparently parks the motorcycle in his bedroom.
Among other things, Parsis are notorious for their short temper and suspicious nature. It makes for unusual conversation. A Parsi owner of a Hyundai Verna in ‘immaculate condition' has sold his 2008 car for Rs 4.1 lakh within two days of putting up an ad on Quickr. His wife informs me over the phone that he is out on an evening walk. Five minutes later, a gentleman who refuses to part with his name, no doubt the owner himself, comes on the line to say that both the owner and his wife have left the country.
Another Parsi who has his Tata Nano for sale online with the line, ‘Seeking buyer who will take care of my most prized possession', refuses to talk about why he is selling his car.
“Why are you selling your car?”
“My wish.”
“Yes, but can you tell me a little so that I can write about it?”
“It is too personal to talk about.”
“Perhaps you can tell me if it's true that Parsis get a good rate for their cars?”
“Are you well-versed in automobiles?”
“Not really. I was just curious about this…”
“Then it's pointless. You won't understand.”
The phone line goes dead.
Another Parsi, who deals in second-hand cars and also frequently buys and sells vehicles for personal use, wants the interview conducted at the doorstep of his house. After verifying my credentials, he reluctantly lets me in, but is unwilling to spend more than five minutes in conversation, despite having confirmed the appointment. He wants to sell a Honda City that he has used since 2010 for Rs 6 lakh, he says, even though he knows most decently-maintained cars of that model would fetch only Rs 5 to 5.6 lakh. He oscillates his gaze between me and his watch and I realise there's nothing more he has to say. What he has said, it seems, is already sensitive enough. As I begin to leave, he says, “Please, please be careful how you quote me.”
According to Turel, many Parsis have motives beyond money when they sell their cars. “We often also want someone who will equally love it.” In 1990, he was moved to see the condition of a 1947 Rolls-Royce. It had once belonged to the Maharaja of Mysore. But when he came across it, it had been lying forlorn in a garage for 11 years. He bought the vehicle for a large sum, an amount he refuses to disclose, and spent an even larger sum getting it into shape. The sum of money he put in was burning a hole in his pocket and he had to sell it eventually. A well-known industrialist in Mumbai sent his nephew to strike a deal for the vehicle. The industrialist agreed on a sum but cancelled a number of meetings with Turel. Eventually, he asked Turel to drive the vehicle to his Juhu bungalow. Convinced that the industrialist had little respect for him, and hence would not care for the car either, Turel sold the Rolls-Royce to someone else who offered less but appeared to appreciate it more.
Turel does not allow anyone but himself to drive his cars. It is a rule he's adopted from his father. But several years ago, he found himself unable to turn down an acquaintance. This individual, now one of India's wealthiest men, was then a relatively unknown youngster. “Like most Gujarati men—a terrible and rough driver,” he says of the experience of sitting in the passenger seat of his Fiat while this man drove the car. A few months later, the man spotted Turel while he was driving the car on Marine Drive. He shouted out for Freddie, but Freddie sped on with just a wave, afraid that he would ask for his car.
When I ask if I may mention the industrialist's name, Turel says, “Please don't. How will (insert name here) feel?”
The claim: Brexit Secretary David Davis said in March that the repeal bill would allow the UK Parliament and Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland administrations to scrap, amend and improve laws.
Reality Check verdict: The bill will repeal the European Communities Act, but it will not change EU laws - it will turn them into UK laws. The UK could, if it wanted to, make changes to those laws after it leaves the EU, probably in 2019.
Prime Minister Theresa May says that after Brexit, UK laws will be "made not in Brussels but in Westminster".
In order to do this, her government will use its Brexit repeal bill, officially called the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.
The bill will do two things.
First, the bill will repeal the European Communities Act, the British law that took the UK into the European Community in 1973 and established the supremacy of EU law over domestic legislation.
Second, it will transpose the entire body of EU legislation into domestic law.
The UK Parliament currently has no power to repeal EU legislation.
It is hard to calculate exactly what proportion of UK laws come from the EU - estimates range from 13% to 60%.
Transposing EU legislation into domestic law will not be a simple "copy and paste" job. The House of Commons library says it could be "one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the UK".
Many EU laws, for example on the environment, refer to EU agencies that the UK will no longer be part of when it leaves the Union.
The repeal bill will have to find new ways of making those rules part of UK law. Any rules that cannot be transferred will have to be repealed.
The government has controversial plans to give ministers the power to make changes to some laws without full Parliamentary scrutiny, which could add further complications.
They are known as Henry VIII clauses, after the Statute of Proclamations 1539, which gave the king power to legislate by proclamation.
Some opposition politicians are concerned this could mean an executive power grab - the government changing laws without proper scrutiny by MPs. The government says these powers will only be used to deal with EU-related gaps in the law, not to make substantive policy changes.
After the bill comes into effect, probably in March 2019, the UK Parliament, and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, will be able to amend, scrap or keep laws that originated from the EU.
That process is likely to take many years.
UPDATE 13 July 2017: This article was updated to include the publication of the bill and its official name.

The Democracy and Power Fund of the Open Society Institute plans to make up to $2 million per year in multi-year, general operating grants to social justice capacity building, organizing, and advocacy efforts based in North Carolina and Texas.
This funding reflects just one of the Democracy and Power Fund's five funding priorities. The fund will continue to support—at roughly $10 million per year—national organizations, including many who work in states across the nation. The new funding for North Carolina and Texas organizations relates solely to new, state-based grantmaking from the Democracy and Power Fund.
Democracy and Power Fund staff will begin to spend more time on the ground in each state as they continue to learn about the issues, policymaking contexts, leaders, funders, and organizations that will inform the fund's nonpartisan grantmaking. Among other considerations, both states have:
rapidly changing political environments;
large, fast-growing, and very diverse populations;
strong state-based organizations that know how to operate in often hostile policymaking forums and have won impressive recent advocacy victories;
compelling political histories and historic barriers to equality that are steadily changing (although likely slower than leaders in the states would like);
engaged local donor communities;
connections to the shared advocacy interests of other OSI funding programs;
great opportunities for building long-lasting state-based power among African-American, Latina/o, immigrant, and youth constituencies.
Over the past several months, the Democracy and Power team has traveled to seven states—Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia—that are facing some of the greatest demographic and policymaking shifts and where issues of special importance to OSI, such as criminal justice reform, immigrant rights, and economic justice, present both challenges and opportunities. While the fund will not engage in new, direct grantmaking in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico, and Virginia, staff are grateful for the tremendous insights they've received from state-based leaders and peer funders to help guide their future grantmaking.

Stellaris, a 4X game by the good folks at Paradox, has likely been one of the most hotly anticipated strategy titles of the year. I know I was excited about it. While I've never gotten too much time in recent Paradox games, I've loved them for their depth, breadth and complexity. I was hoping Stellaris would continue that tradition. While I've tried to be as objective as possible in my views on Stellaris, it's had an enormous mountain to climb because of one game: Distant Worlds. Is Stellaris the new crown jewel in the 4X crown, or is it just an also-ran? Read on to find out how I feel about this whole malarky.
How Easy Was it to Get Into?
Fairly easy, thanks to a pretty comprehensive tutorial. The game also has a pretty solid interface, which helps. While I would've LOVED an actual manual, the tutorial did a decent job getting me into the game. I'd frankly say it'd be a decent tutorial for a newer player (though the tutorial in the new Master of Orion is more geared toward new 4X players). For me, though, I had little problems grasping the basics.
What Did You Think of The Game's Usability?
It's good, but there's room for improvement. While the tutorial is pretty comprehensive, there were still things I was a bit confused on. Also, while the UI is pretty good, it could be better. Do you have any idea how much I would LOVE an expansion planner? You know, a screen that shows all potential colony planets? SURE I could look at the map and kinda see that here or there, but I want a LIST man. Again, I've been spoiled, and this is likely my fault, but after playing Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis IV, I'm shocked at what just appears to be MISSING in terms of menus, data and so on from Stellaris. It's just WEIRD man. Regardless, while the game's usability is solid, there's definite room for improvement.
Was the Gameplay Challenging and Fun?
Well…yes and no. It was challenging and fun in the early part of the game, where you're exploring new worlds for resources, meeting new friends/frenemies/enemies and painting the map as you uncover it, but it kinda stopped being fun as the game went into the mid game. While the idea of sectors is neat, I didn't like giving up control forcibly like that. In Distant Worlds, I can set certain things to be automated, yet still have a hand, if I wish, in how things move and progress. When I was told, “You need to make a sector and trust us to know what we're doing with it.” I just…didn't… Beyond that, I found the game getting more dull the more I got into it. A good 4X has a variety of systems that the player can fiddle with in order to feel like they're making fun, interesting choices. The best 4Xs have elements of espionage and trade, for example, things that were sorely lacking here. Overall I found the game kinda fun, but it has a lot of holes it needs to fill in.
Did you Find any Glaring Flaws with the Game?
As I mentioned above, the lack of some specific systems for espionage and trade are horribly glaring omissions that I figure we'll be buying into with DLC. I'm not entirely happy about that. Eventually I felt like I was running out of things to do. There are so many ships you can build or planets you can explore, you know? Eventually I just became delusioned with it all.
How Did it Look and Sound?
Say what you want about how the game plays, it looks very charming, and the music is lovely.
Are you going to Keep Playing It?
Not until the first DLC pack comes out. This is because the more I play it, the more I see that needs fixing and filling in, and that's not fun.
Which Were Your Favorite and Least Favorite Parts of The Game?
Favorite part was the early part of the game. Exploring and building are great in this game, and I wish there was a way to keep that magic alive during the entirety of it all. My least favorite part? Slowly getting further into the game and wishing I could do things like spy on other races and the like.
Should I Buy It?
Tough question. If you thought Distant Worlds was too difficult/obtuse to get into, this might work for you. It's much easier to grok early on than DW, and can be fun for a while. However, if you're buying this expecting EUIV or the end-all-be-all of 4X games, you'll be disappointed. While it's a competent game, you might be better off buying more complete (I feel) experiences like Star Ruler 2 or, again, Distant Worlds. However, if you come to this knowing you're buying into the potential, the promise of what it COULD be after a few expansions, your expectations might work better for you. Regardless, unless you need to be part of the conversation, and I hate to say this, I think you can wait on this one.
Stellaris Specific Question: This vs. Distant Worlds?
This is what so many people have been asking me from the moment they saw me playing Stellaris on Steam, “Did it dethrone Distant Worlds for you?” If you've not figured it out by now, the answer is clearly, certifiably and certainly no, it hasn't. To be fair, Distant Worlds didn't fully click for me until the second expansion, Legends, so maybe that will be true of Stellaris as well. Who knows though, by that point Distant Worlds 2 might be out or on the horizon.
While Stellaris isn't a bad game, I don't feel it's really a complete one either. It feels as if this was shoved out as a barebone 4X, riding on Paradox's reputation of post-release support, rather than being a complete experience from the get go. I mean maybe Distant Worlds has spoiled me in how it does exploration, trade, espionage and so on, but hell, Stellaris doesn't even have some of those things, which is baffling.
I know Distant Worlds is a much more challenging game to get a grip on for a variety of reasons, but once you grok it, it's a 4X experience like no other you'll encounter. Getting to that point is a much steeper climb than Stellaris, but the result makes it that much more satisfying in the end because Distant Worlds just has so much more to offer. Not just espionage and trade, but playing as a pirate empire, in-game editing, fully-developed espionage, civilian trade and so on.
One thing Stellaris did is make me have a great realization about Distant Worlds: I love playing Distant Worlds so much because the exploration and expansion part of the game takes so much longer to end. Even when you have a burgeoning empire, which would be considered the mid-game in many games, the universes are so chock-full of stuff to see and do that exploration ships are still out there finding stuff.
Distant Worlds is my desert island game, and Stellaris hasn't changed that. Might it in a few expansions? Maybe, but I'm commenting on the game's state now, not the promise of what it might be down the line. If Stellaris ends up surpassing Distant Worlds in terms of features, scope and so on, no one will be happier than I. I just have my doubts that such a thing will come to pass.
Conclusion
The hardest games to write about, in my experience, aren't the great ones or the terrible ones, they're the middling ones. The games that COULD be great, but aren't. The games that should somehow have been awesome but missed the mark. The C-range games, to use a report card as an analogy. Stellaris is such a game. It's not terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but neither is it great. This is the kind of game for which I wish Steam had a “Meh” rating. Again, Paradox's reputation for post-release support is very promising to the future of this game, but as it sits right now, there's better stuff out there to play, in my opinion. I can't tell you to buy a game based on promise, however. Again, if you feel you need to be part of the conversation and want to get in on the ground floor, by all means pick up Stellaris. Otherwise…sigh…you might do well holding off and playing something else for a while while this game matures into the greatness it could be. Thanks for reading!

Tesla shares rose Friday while other automakers fell in the wake of disappointing new-vehicle sales in March, leading Barclays analyst Brian Johnson to write that the tide was turning away from gasoline-burning engines to autos powered by electricity: "We've seen more than our fair share of headlines on how the Model 3 is a game changer, with the EV revolution imminent. Adios gas-powered cars." Big launch: "The future of electric cars is looking bright", says Elon Musk. Credit:David Paul Morris The $US35,000 ($45,579) Model 3 will have a minimum 346 kilometres range, and Musk said he's "fairly confident" deliveries will begin in 2017. Tesla received more than 115,000 reservations in 24 hours, Musk said on stage at the company's Hawthorne, California, design studio. On Friday, Musk said in a tweet that orders had reached 180,000 after 24 hours, with an estimated value of about $US7.5 billion ($9.8 billion). Then about an hour later, he posted that the tally had risen to 198,000. "We have an amazing product. I think you'll be blown away," Musk, 44, said Thursday. "You will not be able to buy a better car for $US35,000, or even close. It's a really good car, even with no options." Changing the game
The Model 3 is the linchpin of Tesla's plan to reach beyond the most affluent buyers and make electric vehicles a significant part of the auto market. Much of the car's platform is new, including the battery architecture and motor technology. Many of the executives who worked on the Model 3, including Chief Technology Officer JB Straubel and chief designer Franz von Holzhausen, have been part of the company's leadership team for years. "Tesla has changed the game again," Andrea James, an analyst with Dougherty & Co., said in a note Friday in which she raised her price target to $US500. "In one day, Tesla generated at least 150,000+ reservations, representing an order book of $US6 billion in revenue, and generating $US150 million in zero-cost capital from the $US1000 customer deposits." "Handover party for first 30 customers Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500." Last year, Musk suggested that if Tesla continued to grow by 50 per cent a year for 10 years, generating a 10 per cent profit margin and garnering a price-to-earnings ratio of 20, it would be valued at about the same $US700 billion Apple was worth then. It's since slid to more like $US600 billion. The number of Model 3 reservations exceeded analysts' estimates and is more than the roughly 107,000 vehicles Tesla has sold to date. At $US1000 each, the deposits would infuse the company's coffers with about $US200 million. While the reservations are refundable, the outpouring suggests there will be plenty of demand for the company to work through once production gets under way.
The challenge ahead of Tesla is going to be making all of these cars quickly enough and well enough. The company aims to make 500,000 vehicles a year by 2020 and is counting on its battery factory under construction near Reno, Nevada, to further drive down battery costs. Tesla's Fremont, California, factory can accommodate assembly of 500,000 autos, said the company, which has yet to master manufacturing in high volumes. Tesla's "master plan," laid out by Musk in August 2006, was to enter the auto industry at higher-end prices, then drive down market as fast as possible with increasingly higher volumes. The Model 3 is the Palo Alto, California-based company's fourth car, after the Roadster, the Model S sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle. The Model X was unveiled in February 2012, with delays pushing back the initial deliveries to customers until September 2015. Hardware for Tesla's Autopilot features will be standard and the four-door sedan will seat five adults. Design features include one large, continuous piece of glass for the rear roof area to enhance visibility. Tesla said it plans to double the number of its Supercharger stations and its store count by the end of 2017. Customers in new markets including Brazil, India and Musk's native South Africa were among consumers able to place orders online Thursday.
US Tesla customers are eager to get their cars before the $US7500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles is phased out. While the Model 3's base price still makes it a luxury model, it is not nearly the financial stretch for consumers as the $US75,000-and-up Model S. "I've been waiting to buy an electric car for 10 years," Mark Dilsizian, a doctoral student at New Jersey's Rutgers University who also runs a software startup, said on Thursday. "It's safer, it's greener, it's better performing, it's better designed." Bloomberg
Ray Richmond is contributing to Deadline's TCA coverage.
The trendy new term at TCA is, “That's a high-class problem,” and the CBS comedy How I Met Your Mother has one. The show is improbably enjoying its best ratings ever during its seventh season and is also CBS' youngest-skewing series. And while the series is contracted to remain on the air through next season, that doesn't necessarily mean it will be “8 and out” for the show. Its co-creator and co-showrunner Carter Bays said during a TCA panel this morning that there hasn't been a discussion about setting a series end date. “Oh, we've talked about it,” he admitted, “because we've gotten the question a lot. But I don't think we can say what it will be just now. It's not a high priority for us. I imagine when we're going into the final season, we'll get people hip to that. But right now it's hard for us to say it will be May 14, 2000-whatever. It will happen when we're officially out of ideas.” Bays added that he knows what the Mother endgame is going to be but naturally had no inclination to share it. Star Jason Segel added that he'd simply love to see the show go on long enough so the story comes to a natural conclusion, “whether that be 8 or 9 years. I was so relieved when I found out there was an actual plan,” he said.
After the panel, Bays elaborated a bit on the idea of setting the end date. “We totally might want to go beyond Season 8,” he noted. “Obviously, it won't just be our call. It will also be about what our actors want and of course what CBS wants. But right now the network is delighted with the numbers we're getting. If everyone's game to go beyond Season 8, it will be a matter of how much story is left. We have that big ending planned, and we know how we need to get the characters in place to make it there.” Would nine seasons be the most that How I Met Your Mother would run then? Bay says he's not necessarily saying that — or even if there will be a Season 9. “But it sure feels good right now to see how our numbers have trended up. Bottom line: We'll do this show as long as it feels creatively fulfilling. And as long as they want us around.”
The Ravens are hoping an undrafted prospect with Hall of Fame bloodlines can help their offense.
The son of Jerry Rice has been invited to try out for the club at its rookie minicamp starting Friday, according to Aaron Wilson of The Baltimore Sun.
Jerry Rice Jr. hasn't signed a deal with the team, but the wide receiver will try to convince the Ravens he's worth a shot after hauling in 11 passes for 86 yards last season at UNLV. After a previous stint at UCLA, Rice Jr. capped off his collegiate career in January with his first-ever touchdown, a 13-yard catch for the Rebels against North Texas in the Heart of Dallas Bowl.
His father reached the end zone for an NFL-record 208 total times, while torching the history books with 1,549 receptions and 22,895 yards during a career that saw him earn 13 Pro Bowl nods and three Super Bowl rings over 20 seasons.
Rice's 5-foot-11, 185-pound son isn't especially fast or productive, but as San Francisco's flirtation with Nate Montana showed us last spring -- the name alone opens doors.
The "Around The League Podcast" wrapped up the draft by picking our winners and losers.
Teófila Martínez Saiz is to be envied, and not just by other mayors. For the last 19 years, the 66-year-old has governed Cádiz, one of Spain's most beautiful cities. Her office is in a palace with elegant columns, ancient statues, opulent murals and a view of the sea.
What's more, she is popular, not least for her ability to mobilize external money for local projects. Currently, a five-kilometer-long (3.1 mile), 500 million bridge is under construction which will stretch from the island city of Cádiz to the mainland. It is to be the highest such structure in Europe and will also have a middle section that can be opened to allow megaships of the future to sail into the bay.
The bridge isn't the only such publically funded project in Cádiz. The European Union also helped the city -- population 123,000 -- build a new wastewater treatment plant, Martínez notes, as well as providing money for continuing workforce education, reindustrialization projects, the expansion of the harbor and more.
In mid-September, the EU earmarked an additional 135 million for a tram line between nearby Chiclana and Cádiz. Brussels is also paying for a new bicycle path above the beach.
Yet despite the windfall, the economy in the city and the surrounding Andalusia region is in disastrous shape. More than a third of the adult population is unemployed and the youth jobless rate in the Cádiz Province is over 57 percent, the highest in all of Spain. Young people in Andalusia prefer to head overseas for work if possible. Those who cannot, stay at home with mom.
The economic difficulties are a problem for the region, but also for the European Union and the European Investment Bank (EIB), which has proffered 6.7 billion worth of development loans to the region in the last 10 years to little effect. The projects have often been accompanied by waste and a not insignificant amount of corruption. This summer, the situation even resulted in the resignation of IEB Vice President Magdalena Álvarez Arza.
A Time of Crisis
Andalusia receives more EU money than almost any other region in Europe. The EU, together with money made available by Spain, made a total of 14 billion available to the province between 2007 and 2013. Some 2.3 billion, most of it from the European Social Fund, was provided for training programs for unemployed Andalusians. But Spanish anti-corruption officials believe that many of the registered vocational training courses never actually took place.
Currently, millions of euros are being spent in the Cádiz port, with the construction of a new, 500-meter-long wharf underway. A port manager says that the quay will provide more room for container ships from overseas to load and unload their cargos. The terminal's capacity is to more than double, from 160,000 units to 350,000 units per year.
The expansion, though, is coming at a time of crisis for global shipping. Indeed, only cruise ships are doing well, and Cádiz, with its baroque beauty from the 17th and 18th century is already a regular stop on the Mediterranean voyages of many such vessels.
Nevertheless, the EU approved 60 million from its Structural Funds for the expansion of the container terminal on the edge of the historic city center. A further 60 million is to come from the EIB in the form of a development loan. The money earmarked for the project is even more than the 118 million estimates for the total costs.
Even locals are critical of the project. "We are fighting for the industrial port to be moved from the city to the mainland," says Teresa Vassalo Varela, a co-founder of the citizens' initiative El Caso Cádiz. It makes no sense, she says, to expand the port on the island, with its historic old town, when there are more suitable sites on the mainland that would be cheaper to develop.
In 2011, the small initiative filed a formal objection to the EU subsidies. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has also stepped in. "Cádiz is one of these places where European structural aid was converted into a business model for the benefit of people who never were, or will be, in need of aid," the initiative wrote to the European Commission in 2013.
Need for a New Bridge?
The activists from El Caso Cádiz see a connection between the giant bridge across the inlet and the container terminal. The six-lane highway only makes sense, they argue, if it is intended to provide trucks from the port access to the mainland. The city itself doesn't really need the bridge; there is already a three-lane span stretching across the narrow end of the inlet which is perfectly adequate. Indeed, the tight city center isn't able to handle any more vehicle traffic than it already has.
Had the expensive new bridge been included in the price tag for modernizing the port, it seems unlikely that the European Commission would have approved the subsidies. The costs would have massively exceeded the expected benefits of increased container traffic. Brussels has consequently continued to insist that the two projects are unrelated. The new bridge, the EU wrote in a letter to the citizens' initiative, is not necessary "for the full operational effectivity of the container terminal." The document notes that the Spanish state is financing the bridge and that it is being built to improve the city's connection to the mainland.
But even EU officials appear to be uncomfortable with that line of argumentation. Funding earmarked for the port expansion has still not been definitively released, pending the outcome of the El Caso Cádiz objection. Nevertheless, the state-owned port authority has moved ahead with construction on the strength of loans and advance payments from the European Commission.
The Port of Cádiz, however, isn't the only terminal in the region currently undergoing expansion. The one in Sevilla is also being improved. As part of the project, the EU and the EIB financed the construction of a new lock, which is Europe's largest. Because the Andalusian capital is located 100 kilometers from the seaside, the Guadalquivir River, which connects Sevilla with the Atlantic, must be dredged to a depth of seven meters (23 feet).
Funding from Brussels is going to pay for the additional dredging of the river, much of which flows lazily through a nature reserve. The 2007 to 2013 EU budget had also included funding for improvements to the Sevilla container port, but environmentalists, including some within the European Commission, have thus far been able to prevent that money from being dispersed.
Meanwhile, there have long been suspicions that there might be more behind the vast quantities of EU funding for Andalusia than meets the eye. Former EIB Vice President Àlvarez Arza, for example, has been accused of being part of an illegal system for the dispersal of aid money. In 2001, Andalusia established a fund to help workers hit by layoffs, but some of the money was allegedly misappropriated. Álvarez Arza has denied all accusations of wrongdoing and posted 30 million in bail to avoid pre-trial detention.
World-Class Highways and Ports
There are images showing Álvarez Arza in 2005, when she was still minister of public works, at the signing of the EIB loan for the gigantic lock in Sevilla. A picture from 2007 shows her looking proudly at a model of the gigantic bridge spanning the Cádiz inlet. "It will be higher, longer and wider," she gushed happily. She was also present at the signing of the EIB loan agreement for the Cádiz container terminal.
Today, the EIB has a problem. When El Caso Cádiz began questioning the role played by Álvarez Arza in 2011, the investment bank brushed aside their concerns. "Following an investigation by the independent complaint department of the EIB, no violations of EIB rules were found," the bank wrote in a statement provided to SPIEGEL. The final decision to provide the loans was not made by the managing board, but by the administrative council, which is made up of representatives from all EU member states, the statement continued. Recent checks of projects Álvarez Arza was involved in likewise found no irregularities.
Inge Grässle, however, has her doubts. She is the chair of the Budgetary Control Committee in the European Parliament. In early September, she submitted a parliamentary question to the Commission reading in part: "What role did Ms Álvarez Arza play in the authorization and negotiation of a financing agreement with the Cádiz Bay Port Authority? What did the agreement say, and what funds have been granted by the EIB and the Commission for the construction of the port terminal, the building of the bridge in Cádiz, and links connecting it with industrial estates in and around Cádiz?"
Cádiz Mayor Martínez is not discouraged. Though work on the bridge has been temporarily halted due to renewed cost overruns, construction on the structure and on the other projects has progressed far enough that, she believes, there is no turning back.
Only the future sometimes fills her with trepidation. "We are going to have world-class highways, train lines and ports," she says. "What will we do if nobody wants to use them in the end?"
The online distribution platform for PC gamers known as Steam is provided as a service to gamers and the gaming community. As experienced gamers in online distribution, we are able to recognize when a company wishes to be ambitious and innovative and respect such actions. Electronic Arts is such a company. With their new online distribution platform recently released known as Origin, they aim to provide competition with the current leading online distributor. The aim of Origin is to compete with the industry leader of online distribution, Steam, and to provide gaming excellence through their platform. EA wishes to accomplish this with Origin by releasing games exclusive to their platform; games such as Crysis 2, which was recently pulled from Steam, and Battlefield 3 which is arguably the biggest release the company has seen or attempted. While it is acceptable to have competition and exclusives, it is unacceptable having a popular intellectual property such as Battlefield 3 to be released exclusively on such an inferior platform especially when said game aims to be the year's biggest title. Origin lacks the customizability featured by Steam and lacks the large player base and following that Steam has. For example, Steam has more players online at any given second than both PS Online and Xbox Live. Origin has leaps and bounds to overcome for it to be able to claim such an astounding feat and the exposure given to it by Steam will only help to promote its product. Such a leap backwards, especially with the industry in the current state of turmoil as it is, will only be met with harsh results, mainly because Origin still has much to go for it to be accepted amongst gamers. Battlefield 3 is an attempt by EA to outmatch its current rival, the Call of Duty series and releasing Battlefield 3 on a platform as unpopular as Origin will cause a great loss in sales. Meanwhile, Call of Duty is indeed releasing across multiple and superior platforms such as Steam. With Battlefield 3 being exclusive to such a restricted distribution medium, EA abdicates its responsibility as a service to gamers. Therefore, we, the undersigned, do hereby petition for Battlefield 3 to be released not only on Steam, but on Origin as well. By expanding its reach, EA will be able to overtake the current industry giant known as Activision - creators of the Call of Duty franchise - and finally be able to step out of its shadow. By releasing exclusively on Origin, EA only hurts themselves by limiting and alienating their audience. To demonstrate this, the signers of this petition hereby decree that any game released solely on Origin heretofore will not be bought as it is believed such a step backwards in the industry is ridiculous and unacceptable. Sincerely, The Undersigned
There's something exciting afoot in the world of cosmology. Last month, Roger Penrose at the University of Oxford and Vahe Gurzadyan at Yerevan State University in Armenia announced that they had found patterns of concentric circles in the cosmic microwave background, the echo of the Big Bang.
This, they say, is exactly what you'd expect if the universe were eternally cyclical. By that, they mean that each cycle ends with a big bang that starts the next cycle. In this model, the universe is a kind of cosmic Russian doll, with all previous universes contained within the current one.
That's an extraordinary discovery: evidence of something that occurred before the (conventional) Big Bang.
Today, another group says they've found something else in the echo of the Big Bang. These guys start with a different model of the universe called eternal inflation. In this way of thinking, the universe we see is merely a bubble in a much larger cosmos. This cosmos is filled with other bubbles, all of which are other universes where the laws of physics may be dramatically different from ours.
These bubbles probably had a violent past, jostling together and leaving “cosmic bruises” where they touched. If so, these bruises ought to be visible today in the cosmic microwave background.
Now Stephen Feeney at University College London and a few pals say they've found tentative evidence of this bruising in the form of circular patterns in cosmic microwave background. In fact, they've found four bruises, implying that our universe must have smashed into other bubbles at least four times in the past.
Again, this is an extraordinary result: the first evidence of universes beyond our own.
So, what to make of these discoveries. First, these effects could easily be a trick of the eye. As Feeney and co acknowledge: “it is rather easy to find all sorts of statistically unlikely properties in a large dataset like the CMB.” That's for sure!
There are precautions statisticians can take to guard against this, which both Feeney and Penrose bring to bear in various ways.
But these are unlikely to settle the argument. In the last few weeks, several groups have confirmed Penrose's finding while others have found no evidence for it. Expect a similar pattern for Feeney's result.
The only way to settle this will be to confirm or refute the findings with better data. As luck would have it, new data is forthcoming thanks to the Planck spacecraft that is currently peering into the cosmic microwave background with more resolution and greater sensitivity than ever.
Cosmologists should have a decent data set to play with in a couple of years or so. When they get it, these circles should either spring into clear view or disappear into noise (rather like the mysterious Mars face that appeared in pictures of the red planet taken by Viking 1 and then disappeared in the higher resolution shots from the Mars Global Surveyor).
Planck should settle the matter; or, with any luck, introduce an even better mystery. In the meantime, there's going to be some fascinating discussion about this data and what it implies about the nature of the universe. We'll be watching.

Since joining Hulu in June, Joel Stillerman, photographed Sept. 6 at the streamer's offices in Santa Monica, says a top goal in the new job is "to get at this question of where the edge of television is."
Joel Stillerman also discusses next year's potential hit 'The Looming Tower,' battles over ‘Walking Dead' in his AMC years and how the streamer is seeking "new forms of content."
When Joel Stillerman arrives at the Emmy Awards Sept. 17, he'll do so with divided loyalties.
A piece of him will be cheering on Better Call Saul, the best drama series nom that he greenlit and then shepherded as president of original programming and development at AMC, where he spent the bulk of that last decade. Though a prequel to another series (Breaking Bad) that predated Stillerman, Saul quickly became an integral piece of the networks' next generation of flagship hits alongside Preacher and The Walking Dead.
The other, likely louder piece, will be rooting for The Handmaid's Tale, a series that, in a matter of weeks this spring, helped elevate Hulu, where Stillerman, 56, began as chief content officer in late June. As he looks to lean more aggressively into original programming (along with acquired fare), the eerily timely dystopian drama could prove both a model and a calling card.
Indeed, Stillerman's move, to the newly created position overseeing content strategy and more than 40 employees, comes at a crucial time for Hulu, which long had been stuck in the shadows of deeper-pocketed rivals Netflix and Amazon. But with the heat of Handmaid's and a domestic-only content budget that now hovers around $2.5 billion, the 9-year-old service — a joint venture of NBCUniversal, Fox, ABC and Time Warner — seems to be shifting swiftly from an outlet better known for broadcast reruns to streaming's top tier. Up next: a cadre of high-profile projects from J.J. Abrams and Stephen King (Castle Rock), Alex Gibney and Dan Futterman (The Looming Tower) and House of Cards' Beau Willimon (The First).
In his early days on the job, the Chicago native, who's spent the entirety of his career on the east coast until relocating to Santa Monica for this position, has been busy parsing viewership data for Hulu's 47 million-plus viewers. "It's this treasure trove," says Stillerman, still trying to make sense of the engagement metrics. "Figuring out how to deploy it intelligently is going to be a huge challenge." (The company, which recently launched a live TV service, hasn't released a subscriber figure since 2016, when it touted 12 million.)
Now, in his first sit-down interview in the new job, the married father of two grown children opens up about Netflix's $6 billion budget, AMC's auteur battles and the post-Handmaid's plan for Hulu.
In the past, I've heard you speak with pride about the fact that you've managed to have a lengthy and successful Hollywood career without ever living in Los Angeles. So, you caved.
I did, it's true. But ask anybody who works for me: I'm a world-class caver. (Laughs.)
So what was it about this opportunity that convinced you to uproot your career and your life on the East Coast?
On a personal level, my kids are grown and out of the house, so it was a little easier to contemplate now. But there are very few opportunities — and given where I've sat for the last few years, I've known about what's out there — that could've gotten me to even think about leaving. Hulu was one of them. I'm genuinely impressed with their ability to build a programing slate from scratch, which I know firsthand is extremely difficult, no matter how much money or resources you have. It's really more about building up trust in the creative community. And here they were coming off a major high point with Handmaid's. I also love how Hulu's positioned from a business point of view — the fact that it's split between ad-supported and non-ad-supported. There's something advantageous about that.
Can your leap to Hulu be seen as a sign of how difficult it is for a basic cable net to stay competitive in a market dominated by streamers?
It would be disingenuous to sit here and say that there aren't challenges on the linear cable side, but, as I'm finding out firsthand, it's not all wine and roses on the streaming side, either. The challenge of how to grow and stay relevant in a linear space is very real, but it's no more or less daunting than waking up in the morning and thinking, "Today I have to find X number of people to subscribe to Hulu, to reach into their checkbook and make that decision." And then we need to keep them, which is something that never really entered into the equation in linear cable. I never woke woke up one day at AMC and thought it was somehow directly our responsibility to keep people in the cable universe.
Now that you're at a streaming service, what's priority No. 1?
Creatively, I really want to lean in to the question of what it means to be making TV in the streaming world. There's this seismic change that's taken place in the way people consume content, and yet the way it's created is still essentially the same as it's been for the last however many years. I want us to think about it differentially. Maybe it's not all half-hours and hours, or cable orders and broadcast orders. In streaming now, [the model] is about finding people and keeping them, and there's a disconnect between those business objectives and the way content is created. Every time we put a show on the air, no matter how good it is, you are in some way highlighting one of the things that we're trying to overcome at Hulu, which is people coming in and leaving. So, what does it mean to create content where one of the objectives of that content is not just to get as many people [as possible] to show up, but to keep them there? That's a different set of challenges that the TV industry has not leaned into.
What do you say when writers ask, "What should I bring to you?"
I'm trying to get at this question of where the edge of television is. Some people might say it's Transparent or a show like Black Mirror, but the edge of TV cannot be just excellent versions of things that we've been looking at for 20, 30, 40 years. There have got to be new forms of content. We talk a lot about our competitors but there's no bigger purveyor on the planet than YouTube, and there's something to be learned from that.
How important will it be to curate a distinct brand a la FX versus trying to be all things to all people a la Netflix?
No matter where you do this, if you're not asking, "Who do we want to be and how does that delineate us from the people down the block?" you're missing out on a fundamental part of the job. That work has been going on for a while here, and the early Hulu offerings on the originals side — character-driven comedies, genre — reflect the usage that they saw before originals were really around. Where do we go? We have a real challenge. I don't think we're going to wake up tomorrow and think we need to be all things to all people. It has to be more tactical than that. That will be one place where we'll start to delineate ourselves from [Netflix] and others.
What opportunities do you see in the success of Handmaid's Tale?
Any time you can have a show that's functioning at an extremely high level unto itself but then is the beneficiary of some cultural relevance — even if that cultural relevance is a bit unfortunate — that's a good thing. But the most important thing Handmaid's Tale can do is prove that Hulu is a place that can create hit shows. That's a loaded word, I know. But I'm referring to it in the context of cultural impact because that's a real currency now.
So, how do you replicate that?
You're in trouble if you go, "We want to do TV that taps into the current mood of the country or the political climate." [However,] we have a very, very powerful piece of programming coming down the pike next year, The Looming Tower, which is based on a book [by Lawrence Wright about the rise of al-Qaida]. Sadly, terrorism is a subject that will still be in the news.
Where does your $2.5 billion domestic programming budget leave you standing against your competitors?
I don't wake up in the morning worried we don't have enough money to do what we want to do.
It's not Netflix's $6 billion, though.
Sure, but all the money in the world does not guarantee that you will spend it wisely and allocate it properly.
Unlike nearly every other company, Hulu doesn't seem to be focused on owning its shows. Will that change?
It was critically important and a huge part of transforming AMC's business. But here, we have no plans now to go into full ownership. And in fact, we see ourselves as having a bit of an advantage by virtue of offering opportunities to studios that might not be there at some of the other places. That's not going to be the tipping point for us, but in a world where people have tons of choices — particularly at a certain level of creator — I'm glad that we have the opportunity to say, "We don't want to own it outright. In some instances, we'd like to be your partner." It's going to be a situation that we keep a close eye on as we move forward.
Walking Dead's Robert Kirkman just signed a massive overall deal at Amazon. Shonda Rhimes made a huge one at Netflix. Will Hulu join this arms race for talent?
I don't think you need to be as focused on being in the talent business as you do if ownership is central to your business. That said, I wouldn't rule out Hulu looking at some strategic relationships.
In late 2015, your boss, Mike Hopkins, told THR he "wouldn't be surprised if we don't look around the globe in the next year or two." So where is Hulu with plans for international expansion?
In my first few weeks, I've been involved in a few discussions about what it might look like. The DNA of this company is to always be looking for new opportunities, and that's one of them, but there are no formal plans at this point.
Hulu's "team of rivals" ownership structure long has been cited as a competitive disadvantage. How much of those politics have you encountered?
I haven't. I've only seen the benefits ... but I come into these eyes wide open.
Looking back, there were some tense years at AMC, where you earned a reputation for being so cost-conscious that you fought publicly or parted ways with multiple showrunners. What did people not know?
Most of those stories were not fully representative of what was really going on behind the curtain. We happened to be at a moment when there were a number of high-profile shows on, and it's funny because when you're not the focus of people's attention, you want to be there. And then when you are, you go, "This is not as much fun as I thought it was."
In the case of Frank Darabont, who remains in a nasty legal battle with AMC, the emails that have since come out reveal he was no picnic to work with. How did you feel when those emails were made public?
I hope you respect this but I don't think I have anything to say about the emails or the Frank Darabont situation.
When you're not at the office, where can people usually find you?
Well, I have an unhealthy obsession with bowling.
What do you bowl?
My average was 179 last season. It's impossible to not have a good time at a bowling alley. Throw in cheap beer, and you've got a pretty great antidote to all the stress and pressure of this job.

Photographer Ben Franke has been documenting the parkour, or free running, scene in New York City since 2008.
Both artistic and athletic, parkour's daredevil leaps, rolls and climbing have their origins in physical education guru George Hebert's "methode natural," which he began developing when he was a French naval officer traveling in Africa around the beginning of the 20th century. "Their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skillful, enduring, resistant and yet they had no other tutor in Gymnastics but their lives in Nature," he wrote of many of the people he observed.
Hebert's method would form the basis for much of the training of the French military in World War I.
Fast forward to today, and parkour styles vary from state to state, city to city, country to country.
"I love how [Ben] is trying to capture this kind of sport that is different from a lot of photography that I've seen depicting parkour and martial arts," says Kenny Wong, one of Franke's subjects. "I feel like Ben also captures an essence of the parkour scene in a way that is very unique in a New York City sense."
Trying to capture the energy and power of his subjects, Franke used flour for depth and drama, to highlight their movements for his "Parkour Motions" series.

Ben Franke is based in New York City, and his work has appeared in a number of U.S. and international publications including The New York Times, Time Out New York and the German magazine GEO. In addition, Franke shoots for commercial clients such as Halsbrook, IFEU and Porter Grey.
If you're an American woman, there's a good chance your vision of femininity—how women should dress, talk, and act—owes something to Cosmopolitan or Sassy or some other magazine targeting a female audience.
The women's magazine as we know it—a lavishly illustrated celebration of consumption and beauty aimed at a popular audience—emerged in England in the 1870s. In a 1994 paper for the Journal of Design History, Christopher Breward explains how this new format grew out of shifting views of a woman's role in society.
Breward writes that the nineteenth century brought a new populist model to women's publishing, which had been, since the 1700s, an elite, literary affair. Better printing equipment, a falling newspaper tax, and rising literacy rates brought magazines to more households. The first popular interest British fashion magazine started up in 1806, but the 1870s and 1880s brought a new variety to the genre—graphics-heavy, with a focus on women's position in the public world. In 1875, there were 20 such titles. By 1898, there were 30.
One magazine explained that its features on fashion and decorating had “the aim of being useful to others, who are prevented by duties or distance from visiting those houses where the best of everything is to be seen.” Breward notes that another, unstated purpose of the features was promoting advertisers' products. Either way, he writes, the central idea was building a “feminized consumer culture.”
Breward writes that women of this era were navigating contradictions inherent in the way people understood the separate spheres of men and women. Women were portrayed as “pure angelic” wives and mothers without concern for material things, but they were also expected to communicate their families' social positions through their clothing and appearance.
In the 1850s and 1860s, women's magazines moralized about the need for women to embrace the role of homemaker. But by the mid-1870s, many of them were running stories that glamorized showy clothes and illustrations of beautifully dressed women in public spaces. Common scenes included women boarding a train or talking in groups at a café.
As department stores transformed fashion consumption in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the magazines increasingly showed images of women shopping. The illustrations often depicted an elegantly dressed woman choosing from a variety of hats or accessories.
Breward writes that the journals “not only encouraged the act of public buying, but engaged the reader in a form of private surrogate shopping. For the 3d. price of a journal, women bought the opportunity to peruse a fantasy world which released them from the immediate pressures of home.”
The magazines pushed their own form of male dominance—the idea that women should dress to please men—as well as the emerging notion of consumerism as a route to happiness. But they also offered a vision of freedom and independence that is still part of the appeal of today's women's magazines.

SIXTY-EIGHT years of history were wiped out on Friday when the European Commission issued its decision about Cyprus Airways. As had been widely expected, the Commission deemed that part of the funds in excess of €100 million paid to the airline by the state in the form of assistance and through the issue of new capital was in fact a subsidy – €66 million of it had to be paid back. Unable to do so, there was only one choice left to the company – closing down.
Although older than the Cyprus Republic, the national carrier had become a symbol and flagship of the new state when the former was established. Its main shareholder was BEA (British European Airlines), but on independence the Republic took control of the majority stake. By 1991, when British Airways gave up its shares, the state controlled 80 per cent of the shareholding with the rest distributed among individuals. Despite the foreign participation, the national carrier had been run by successive governments and their placemen ever since independence, which is why it has closed down.
In fact the company has followed a very similar path to the state on its way to bankruptcy. It was subject to self-serving decisions by board members, incompetently run by unqualified party-men and sucked dry by the unions with the blessing of the politicians who had turned it into a dumping ground for unemployable party members; there was a time, not too many years ago, when it employed in excess of 2,000 staff on wages and benefits that profitable airlines did not pay. Its payroll, like the state's, was unsustainable but even after the airline was bailed out by the taxpayer the wage cuts were too small, while the overpaid pilots took the company to court for cutting their princely salaries and won.
There was no troika to impose the painful cuts that could have increased the chances of survival when the airline was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2012. The Christofias government's action plan at the time included pay rises for the lowest paid of the airline's workers! By then, it may have already been too late to save the airline after so many years of mismanagement and waste. Tens of millions were lost on ill-advised aircraft purchases, like the Airbus 330, the setting up of Hellas Jet and operation of Eurocypria, not to mention the regular early retirement schemes with ultra-generous compensation packages.
It could not have been any other way at a company that was run by politicians and unions. Business principles were anathema to them as the former tried to maximise votes (and invisible benefits) and the latter the income of their pampered members who were accustomed to wages that were the envy of the rest of working population. The benefits they squeezed out of the company over the years were absurd, but the politicians never said ‘no' to them. One chairman agreed to annual pay rises of four per cent when the airline was recording millions in annual losses.
And now, the 550 workers that were still employed by the company will join the ranks of the jobless. Some were protesting outside the company HQ on Friday night claiming that the government wanted the company to close down. The truth was that the company was beyond saving. The European Commissioner for Competition said in a statement on Friday: “Cyprus Airways has received large quantities of public money since 2007 but was unable to restructure and become viable without continued state support… injecting additional public money would only have prolonged the struggle without achieving a turn-around.”
Cyprus Airways was doomed because it was never run like a business and the main reason of its existence was to serve the interests of the political party establishment, its directors and its underworked, overpaid employees. Never in its history was there an ethos of customer service or a policy of building customer loyalty, because the paying passengers were always an afterthought. How could it have survived after the introduction of the open skies and the arrival of competition when it could no longer use its monopolistic power to charge high fares and offer poor service.
It never adapted to the competitive environment it found itself in after 2004. The workers were not willing to give up their ‘conquests', the politicians were happy to carry on wasting the taxpayer's money so as not to anger the unions and successive boards did nothing, obeying the orders of the government. Such reckless irresponsibility and incompetence could only have ended in bankruptcy.
Westfield police are asking for help locating Susan Griffin, 48, who was reported missing by her family Tuesday evening.
"She was last seen in the Greenfield, Mass. area," the Westfield Police Detective Bureau wrote in a Facebook post. "Due to recent changes in her behavior, family members are concerned for her well being."
Griffin's sister, a West Springfield resident, called police shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday, telling them that Griffin had left her letters that expressed emotional distress, according to a Westfield police report. Griffin had left her sister her house keys and told her to take care of her cats, according to the report.
West Springfield police asked Westfield officers to check on Griffin, but they did not find her at her Meadow Street apartment.
Police describe Griffin as five feet four inches tall and 120 pounds with brown eyes and dark hair with a patch of gray on top. Anyone with information in the case is asked to call the Westfield Police Department at (413) 562 5411

..... #4 – Caravan - Woodland [Spring 2009]
________________________________________ ________________________________________ ___________
...................
...................
A few years ago, in dense woodland a few miles from my home, I discovered a caravan. Encircled by trees and undergrowth, and over a mile from the nearest road, its presence was utterly incongruous, with few clues as to how or why it had come to rest at this point. For almost a year, I kept my distance, fearful it was inhabited by a hermit and that I would be chased away if I ventured too close. Eventually, I investigated further and discovered that it was empty; its furnishings intact, but no sign of human inhabitants. Sadly, the door was locked, and so I gave it little thought for several months.
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
As I became more adept at gaining entry to places (hospitals, houses, building sites) my sense of the possible changed; and I finally found a way inside last summer. Expecting damp and buckled floors, perhaps even a makeshift aviary, I was shocked by how habitable the caravan still seemed. The floors and worktops were littered with mouse droppings, but it was otherwise in remarkable condition. Cushions veiled with a fine layer of dust, the carpet faded yet coarse, it was only upon closer inspection of the veneers and window frames that any real damage was evident.
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
The only objects on display were a fire extinguisher and a box of matches, and so I quickly started opening drawers and cupboards in the hope of finding something more personal. Though the majority were empty, I still unearthed several clues about the final inhabitant: a charcoal jacket (pockets full of nails), a pair of boots and, most interestingly of all, a diary from 1989 (unused, but it at least revealed how long the caravan had lain empty).
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
Throughout that summer I would often return to the forest (sometimes with Renée) and would invariably spend an hour or two cocooned inside the caravan. Despite setting out with the high-minded intention to read or to write, I would usually just sit there (gazing out across woodland or listening to the spiral songs of linnets, cuckoos and skylarks).
...................
...................
...................
...................
[A particularly pleasant side-effect of the moss-covered windows was the lambent light it would cast across the desk (lightshafts streaming through the canopy and then filtered through years' worth of accreted dirt and grime)...]
...................
...................
Somehow our plan to spend a night there – or to seek shelter during a storm (the roof spittooned with hailstones) – never came to anything, and as summer drew to a close we returned to Cambridge.
...................
...................
...................
...................
After a break of nearly a year, we stayed here for a week in November – quickly settling into a pattern of two or three extended walks each day.. (answering to a need for more varied terrain after the planar drudge of Cambridge). On our final day, without any forethought or planning, we suddenly found ourselves in the vicinity of the caravan, and so decided to check on its condition (mindful of falling trees or the owner's return).
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
In the months since our last visit, the wood had become increasingly overgrown, and was now almost impossible to traverse – the few remaining pathways consumed by brambles, hawthorns and nettles. After much crawling and stamping, we finally found a way through (emerging covered in cobwebs, burrs, lacerations..) – and were confronted by the sight of a broken window, and the door swinging on its hinges.
...................
...................
Peering inside, there was no obvious damage, though we were startled to see a piece of paper, weighted down with a pencil, on top of the writing desk. On a page torn from the diary, someone had written:
They call this “Sanctuary Wood” – for me it fulfils a dream. I'm sorry I trespass but if I had my dream somewhere like this would be my home and sanctuary.
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
...................
In the past, trampled bracken has led me to suspect other visitors; but given the caravan's location, I'd simply assumed it was the landowner. The idea of another interloper initially caused much unease (even flickers of resentment) as I briefly imagined an ever-increasing flow of visitors and vandalism (as at Cane Hill or Severalls).
...................
...................
I soon regained perspective, however, and realised how magical it was that we should both have found this place (and that this person should feel compelled to commit something to paper). In response I wrote of my own attachment to the caravan (lamenting the damage to the window) and asked this person who they were (disclosing something of myself in turn). At the end of my reply, I added that we'd be returning before Christmas, and hoped very much that they'd write back.
...................
...................
...................
...................
And now it's December, and we are in W----- again. On our third day here, we set out for the caravan – noticing, as we approached, that the window was covered in plastic and that the diary now lay open on the writing desk:
...................
...................
22/11/05
I can remember this place years ago. There used to be sheep, then I lost touch with the area. Don't know who broke the window but yes it is a great shame. Maybe someone couldn't pick the lock. Hope you still work here. I just sit in peace.
...................
...................
23/11/08
Been coming here for years. Lost my way for a while. I used to fish in the pond when I was younger. Don't know where they [the people] all went but in a selfish way I am glad. I'm a support time recovery worker. Know what you mean about this place and comfort. Put a bit of poly at the window. Wish I could escape everyday – only weekends for me. Happy to meet another refugee from the world.
23/11/08
I don't know who owns the land but I think it was divided. There used to be sheep up this end.
...................
...................
29/11/08
Had a quick visit – dark, damp, safe. It looks like you will have this haven to yourself. This town is looking a bit expensive for this old boy. Looks like it's time to move on. Couple of deer and plenty of pheasants for company. Hope plastic stays in place, keep a bit of rain out. Enjoy – will soon be Christmas.
...................
...................
14/12/08
Quick walk over – stressed. Unless you walk over the field, looks like someone else visits. Window has held? Good job too. Hope you enjoy Christmas and the New Year brings all you want. Don't know, but if I win the lottery think I might buy a wood – one with a small green caravan in it.

SAN FRANCISCO – The San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted unanimously this evening to affirm the Final Subsequent Environmental Impact Report certification for the proposed multi-use arena for the Golden State Warriors in the Mission Bay neighborhood.
After more than four hours of public comment and dialogue on the impact of the stadium to the community and the environment, from individuals both for and against the development, the board voted unanimously to approve the report's certification, giving the project the green light.
The appeal of the report, submitted by the Mission Bay Alliance, a coalition of UCSF stakeholders and San Franciscan voters concerned with the potential negative impacts of the arena, was based on concerns that the project will be too close to the recently constructed University of California at San Francisco Medical Center.
The Mission Bay Alliance maintains that the arena could negatively impact the health of patients and severely impact traffic surrounding the UCSF hospitals.
Members of the UCSF community, concerned parents of UCSF patients and Mission Bay residents spoke in favor of the appeal, arguing that noise pollution and traffic are already problems on game days at AT&T Park, home to the San Francisco Giants baseball team, and saying that congestion in the neighborhood would only be exacerbated with construction of another stadium.
A nurse practitioner at UCSF said not only is she concerned that vehicle exhaust and noise pollution will negatively impact patient care, but also that the increased traffic will delay hospital staff and patients as they try to get to the hospital.
Theo Ellington, director of public affairs for the Warriors, disagrees with the Mission Bay Alliance and opponents of the project, saying that the project “makes sense” to be at the intersection of Third and 16th streets and said traffic concerns will be mitigated as the project will provide the city with four new light-rail vehicles for the T-Third line that passes by the proposed arena.
Joel Koppel, a spokesman for the San Francisco Building and Construction Trade Council, said construction, electricians, sheet metal workers and other laborers came out to support the proposed arena today, just hours after Golden State Warriors president Rick Welts signed a letter of intent to pay trade workers a prevailing wage, as opposed to other private development projects which can pay close to minimum wage.
Welts addressed the board at the hearing this evening and urged the supervisors to approve the certification of the EIR.
Many supporters of the project said they wanted to be a part of creating a landmark stadium in San Francisco for the Warriors, while others said they support the arena because they appreciate all the resources the Warriors Community Foundation has already given to the community.
Others said they simply support the project because they want San Francisco to be home to the Warriors basketball team, who are currently undefeated so far this season.
Members of the United Playaz, a group that advocates for non-violence and tries to help young people thrive, showed their support for the arena today along with construction workers who are looking forward to the prevailing wage union jobs promised by the Warriors.
Rudy Corpuz, executive director of United Playaz, said ever since the arena was proposed he has been advocating in favor of jobs, affordable housing and other opportunities for low-income, at-risk youth in the community that the arena can offer.
Warriors officials say the arena will bring thousands of year-round jobs to the neighborhood as well as around 10,000 union jobs during the construction phase.
But the Mission Bay Alliance says the EIR has “serious, deep flaws” and doesn't do enough to mitigate severe traffic impacts in the area. They say it underestimates the number of people who will drive to events, and there isn't enough parking in the area to accommodate the demand posed by arena-goers.
A new poll released Monday, commissioned by the Mission Bay Coalition and conducted by EDC Research, found that fewer than half of the 540 registered voters polled supported development of the proposed arena and commercial buildings at Third and 16th streets.
At 49 percent voter support, the proposed arena has seen a 12 percent decline since a Warriors-commissioned poll, conducted by David Binder Research and released in July, which showed about 61 percent support for the development.
The Mission Bay Alliance appealed the project's 5,000-page Final Environmental Impact Report, which was released on Oct. 23 and certified 10 days later by the Commission on Community Investment and Infrastructure.
Osha Meserve, an attorney with the Mission Bay Alliance, said she's concerned the public hasn't had a chance to look carefully at the proposal, noting that there were only 10 days between the public release of the Final Environmental Impact Report and certification of it by the commission.
The Mission Bay Alliance has plans to move forward with litigation on the grounds that the project violates the Clean Water Act.
The Warriors arena Final Subsequent EIR was affirmed by 10 members of the Board of Supervisors, with newly-elected Supervisor Aaron Peskin recusing himself from today's vote.

Rape in the Military. That was the headline on a Maclean's cover in 1998—one of four cover stories that year stemming from a nine-month investigation into disturbing behaviour in the Canadian Forces. Now, 16 years later, Maclean's and its sister magazine, L'actualité, are coming together to publish another months-long investigation into the sexual violence that still plagues our military.
L'actualité reporters Noémi Mercier and Alec Castonguay talked to dozens of victims, attended court martials, culled statistics and documents under Access to Information, and visited bases across the country and Afghanistan. Their powerful story appears at the centrepiece of both magazines—the first time ever the sister magazines are jointly publishing a cover story.
Every day, five individuals in the Canadian military community become victims of sexual assault. It is our military's disgrace. Our special investigation is available now in the Maclean's iPad edition. The print edition hits stands Thursday.
UPDATE: Defence Minister Rob Nicholson responded to the Maclean's and L'actualité cover stories Thursday afternoon in the following statement:
I was deeply angered to learn of these alleged sexual assaults in the military. Since 2006, our Government has continuously fought on behalf of victims and enhanced the laws in this country to combat sexual assault. Sexual misconduct of all kinds will not be tolerated within the Canadian Armed Forces and I have asked the Chief of Defence Staff to get to the bottom of these serious matters.
Chief of the Defence Staff General Tom Lawson also released a statment Thursday afternoon, in which he promised an immediate internal review of existing Canadian Forces programs and policies. The statement, in full, reads:
We frequently review mechanical keyboards here in AnandTech. Over half of them come with mechanical switches from Cherry, and for good reason. If you are keeping track of our recent reviews, you should have noticed that Cherry's switches generally are more consistent than any other type we have tested to this date. Cherry is virtually the inventor of the modern mechanical keyboard switch (not to be confused with the classic buckling spring), manufacturing and marketing them since nearly three decades ago. It is only because their patent expired that other manufacturers were able to copy their switch designs.
With all of that said, Cherry is not only supplying their switches to other keyboard manufacturers. As a matter of fact, the company has a significant line-up of their own keyboard and mouse products. On the other hand, Cherry's products are almost exclusively aimed towards professionals and for specific applications, such as keyboards with biometric or magnetic card readers for security. Considering the target market of their products, naturally their keyboards were using just plastic black or beige parts and never looked like anything special. However, Cherry is taking a huge leap of faith and releasing a new keyboard, the MX Board 6.0, which a mere glance upon it is enough to reveal that it is nothing like their previous products.
Cherry MX Board 6.0 Keyboard - Key Features and Specifications
The world's fastest keyboard – with Cherry MX and Cherry RK
CHERRY MX RED – Gold Crosspoint precision keyswitch for all keys »Made in Germany«
Aluminium housing with sanded finish and grease resistant coating
CHERRY RealKey technology – fully analog signal processing
All keyswitches are read simultaneously
100% anti-ghosting - No inputting errors
Packaging & Bundle
The packaging of the MX Board 6.0 is the perfect example of the company's market philosophy; very sturdy, completely plain and painfully serious. It could be run over by a car and there would not be any damage to the keyboard or the rest of the contents, but there is almost nothing eye-catching about it. As a matter of fact, those who do not know of Cherry might not even realize that there is a keyboard inside the box without closely inspecting it.
Inside the box, we found the keyboard inside a very nice and soft pouch-cover, a large wrist rest and a basic manual. The manual is small and simple, but it is clearly written and more than enough for the few extra functions of the MX Board 6.0.
Finally, retail prices for the MX Board 6.0 are hovering around $200, with a price of $198 at the time this article was written.
Our phone this year
Posted on September 7th, 2016
As you may be aware, we brought a faux-rotary analog telephone to the 2016 burn and placed it on a stool by the road outside our camp. Approximately 2 weeks prior to the burn one of our telephonically-inclined camp members decided to try this project on a whim, not really expecting anything to come of it. There have been other phones on playa for years, we just wanted to have our own.
It was setup just like any standard phone line on this camp member's phone system, with call waiting, voicemail, etc. He set it up Monday morning. Later in the morning another camp member posted the number on /r/burningman and two Burning Man related Facebook groups. And the phone began to ring. And ring. And ring.
We answered some calls but mostly called passersby over to answer calls. The first few days, the calls came in so fast that we would pick up one and immediately hear the call waiting tone of another call coming in. We left camp for the evening on Monday night, and came back to find a group of people gathered around it, answering calls and excitedly talking to random people from all over the world. We went to bed and woke up the next morning to find it still ringing.
We made improvements throughout the week, such disabling call waiting and adding some chairs to the front of our camp for people to sit in and take calls. We wrote the phone number on a whiteboard, and a few other bits encouraging other participants to take calls, or if it wasn't ringing to call their mothers.
We've been asked about call count and such, so here are some quick numbers we pulled from the PBX. A more detailed analysis may follow:
Total Inbound Calls: 14682
Total Inbound Call Time: 6:44:06
Total Outbound Calls: 324
Total Outbound Call Time: 9:03:08
Total Voicemails left: 439
We'll be going through the voicemails, removing the empty ones, censoring any personal information that may have been left, and posting the rest. We are already working on improvements for next year. If you want to get in touch with us, find us on Twitter or Facebook, or email hashtag@octothorpe.club.

BUCKHORN , ONTARIO — Outside Dave and Ann Bowen's cottage at Six Foot Bay, Buckhorn Lake shimmers in the early morning sunlight. It has rained so hard in the past four days that some of the docks — in front of each of the 16 cottages that line the shore — are immersed.
The Bowens have just finished celebrating Canada's 150th birthday alongside their adult children and nine grandchildren — all spread out between three adjacent cottages. Dave is a recently retired school teacher and principal, and Ann is a recently retired nurse.
Although they love their country deeply, they are worried about its movement to the left. Interestingly, they admire the direction of the United States under President Trump.
“You cannot deny he is a force of nature. He may be unorthodox, he may get himself in a pinch with his words, but he certainly reminds you that he is always coming from a position of strength,” said Ann as she took a moment from packing up the cottage to head back home to Peterborough, Ontario.
They are cautious when asking Americans if they approve of their new president, like the folks on vacation from the US who stayed in the cottage next door. When the Bowens found out their visitors supported Trump, they were relieved.
“We didn't want to upset or offend anyone,” Dave said.
It is fascinating to listen to their impressions of the US president. Given the coverage of him throughout Ontario and America — you would think any Canadian would conclude the opposite. The Bowens are well versed in the policy entanglements Trump faces with health care and tax reform and are aware of every House special election since January that's happened in Kansas, Montana and Georgia.
They are also very pragmatic about his approach.
“The man has his weaknesses, that is for sure, but voters knew that going in, and he has as much admitted he is not a groomed politician. Any problem he has faced has mostly come from his use of social media, but his policies are spot-on,” said Dave.
While many Americans point to the universal health care enjoyed by our northern neighbors as a point of envy, Dave says his countryfolk have reason to admire the US — especially on the issue of immigration.
Last January, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to social media and declared, “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada.”
According to the latest statistics, more than 15,000 people have made a claim for asylum in Canada during the first five months of 2017 — almost double the number of the same period last year. That number doesn't include fast-tracked refugees from Syria, more than 45,000 of whom have been admitted since November 2015.
Contrast those statistics with the US: In the last three months of Barack Obama's presidency, the number of refugees admitted to the US hit just over 25,000, but that number dropped to 13,000 in the first three months of Trump administration, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
As a result of Trump's policies, asylum-seekers of African and Middle Eastern origin are flooding into Canada, and our friends in the north aren't entirely happy about it. According to the most recent Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released in March, 48 percent of Canadians support the deportation of these illegal border crossers.
Dave is one of the Canadians who feel his nation's welcome has been overextended. “We are really going in the way of Europe when it comes to governing and outlook,” he said. “I am not sure that is the best direction.”
As a result, the Bowens are not big fans of their prime minister either — and they're not alone. A survey conducted by Forum Research in April found only 42 percent of Canadians approved of how Trudeau was leading the country — his lowest approval rating since taking office in November 2015.
Ann just shrugs and shakes her head, but her criticism is unfailingly polite. “It is just overboard. But we did really like his father, Pierre,” she said of the elder Trudeau, who served twice as prime minister, from 1968 to 1979 and 1980 to 1984.
Trump is a breath of fresh air, said Dave, and he hopes Canada gets a little shake-up, too. “I was watching election night, and I can tell you I have never been so excited about another country's outcome as I was that night.
“Perhaps if some local elections stirred things up, the bigger politicians might pay attention,” he added.
Canadians. Turns out a lot of them are divided and dissatisfied — just like us.
Councillor's child exploitation material 'cartoons'
Updated
A Tasmanian Magistrate has dismissed one of two charges of possessing child exploitation material being defended by Clarence City alderman, David Traynor.
The Magistrate's Court in Hobart has heard Traynor "went out of his way" to ensure the pornographic items he downloaded did not involve children.
53 year old Traynor, of Cremorne, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of possessing the material, after his stolen laptop was recovered by police.
In his police interview played to the Hobart Magistrate's Court this morning Traynor admits he searched for images of "younger females".
Traynor told police he "wasn't stupid" and only used sites claiming those depicted were over the age of consent.
The court heard there were 4,500 videos, 4,800 images and 25 stories of a pornographic nature recovered from Traynor's council-issued laptop.
Only two items - a cartoon strip and a 450 page fictional journal - depicted children engaged in sexual acts.
Traynor's lawyer, Bruce McTaggart, told the court when Traynor downloaded items containing children he deleted them.
Magistrate Michael Hill said while a computer expert may have been able to retrieve a deleted sexually explicit cartoon, Traynor did not have the skills to do that.
The hearing is continuing in the Magistrates Court.

Since 2011, Faith 2 Action's Janet Porter has been working to get the state of Ohio to pass her “Heartbeat Bill” legislation, which would prevent a woman from having an abortion if a fetal heartbeat can be detected, thereby dramatically curtailing reproductive rights by banning abortion “as early as 18 to 24 days after conception.”
Now, after three years of failure despite having organized multiple rallies and attention-grabbing stunts, Porter has decided that she is going to take her case directly to God, sending out an email today announcing a prayer rally to be held outside the Ohio Statehouse next month at which participants will launch a direct “Appeal To Heaven” on behalf of her legislation:
We've called. We've rallied. We've lobbied. On September 17th, we're going over their heads! AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN
Wednesday, September 17th
Ohio Statehouse-High St. Side
10:00 am – 1:00 pm
To pass the Heartbeat Bill Pastors from around the state will lead us as we go over the heads of the elected officials with an Appeal to Heaven!
Porter has even recruited Dominionist “Apostle” Dutch Sheets to film a video explaining the need for such an effort:
A major international resort group's five-star hotel under construction in the Tibetan capital Lhasa may set the stage for more commercial ventures in the ancient city that will erode Tibetan cultural heritage, an overseas advocacy group has warned.
London-based Free Tibet has launched a campaign to boycott worldwide InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) hotels over the company's “Resort Lhasa Paradise,” saying the marketing of the 1,100-room project ignores the “oppressive" political situation for Tibetans living there.
The boycott comes amid similar campaigns by Free Tibet and other groups against a Chinese government-led renovation of Lhasa's traditional Barkhor old town district outside the sacred Jokhang Temple, as well as plans for a Tibetan theme park on the city's outskirts.
IHG's hotel, now being built on the edge of the city some two miles (four kilometers) from the Barkhor area, will bring more Chinese tourists to the area and indirectly spur projects similar to the Barkhor renovation which trivializes Tibetan culture, Free Tibet said.
“At 1,100 rooms, this is by far the biggest luxury hotel in Lhasa and will depend very heavily on Chinese business,” Free Tibet spokesman Alistair Currie said.
“It will foster an increased throughput of wealthy, primarily Chinese tourists … whose interest in Tibetan culture may be limited to or reserved for the ‘Disneyfied' version of it that China is increasingly propagating.”
'PR' for China
Free Tibet singled out the hotel for the boycott, among other international investment projects in the Tibet Autonomous Region, because it “gifts priceless PR to the Chinese regime responsible for gross human rights abuses throughout Tibet," according to the group.
Beijing has tightened security in the city since deadly riots erupted in Lhasa in 2008, and since 2009, 120 Tibetans have self-immolated in protest against Chinese rule.
Free Tibet has also raised concerns about the proposed hotel's employment practices, saying they could discriminate against Tibetans who do not speak Chinese, and its links to a Sichuan real estate magnate who Chinese media reported has been convicted for corruption.
Economic opportunities
An IHG spokesperson said the company had met with Free Tibet to discuss the concerns and that the company believes the hotel—slated to open in 2014—will promote economic opportunities in the region.
“IHG's hotels create jobs and drive tourism income in the communities where they operate, thereby helping to increase living standards in Lhasa and wider Tibet,” the spokesperson said.
“We take our commitments to human rights and creating local economic opportunity very seriously.”
But Free Tibet claims the hotel will contribute to policies that economically marginalize Tibetans.
“Businesses which are Tibetan-owned and which help preserve Tibetan culture can have a positive effect,” for example by using Tibetan language and hiring those who speak it, Currie said.
“But overall, in a repressed and occupied country, it is very hard for any foreign business and especially tourism-related businesses not to directly or indirectly entrench the occupation and help the regime.”
More than 2,000 people have signed Free Tibet's online pledge to boycott IHG hotels over the Lhasa resort and the group has staged protests outside IHG hotels in London and New York.
Barkhor rebuild
Meanwhile, despite similar online campaigns by overseas rights groups against the U.S.$244 million renovation of Lhasa's Barkhor district, the U.S.$2.44 million renovation project has been completed, China's state media reported Monday.
More than 100,000 people had signed a petition by New York-based Students for a Free Tibet calling for a halt to the renovation, and a blog post by Beijing-based Tibetan writer Woeser titled “Please Save Lhasa” went viral on China's microblogs before being removed.
“Lhasa is being destroyed by excessive commercial development,” Woeser said in the May post, which reported that plans for the city also include the development of a 150,000 square meter (1.6 million square feet) shopping mall in the Barkhor, with residents and shopkeepers being relocated.
Last month more than 100 Tibet experts sent a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping and UNESCO saying renovation and new projects in the city were destroying traditional architecture and transforming the Jokhang Temple and the Barkhor into a “superficial tourist spot.”
State media have said the Barkhor renovation project is aimed at modernizing outdated infrastructure by upgrading the sewage system, water supply, and electric lines.
UNESCO has included the Jokhang Temple—considered the most important temple in Tibet—as well as other parts of Lhasa including the Potala Palace—home of Tibetan exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama—on its list of World Heritage Sites.
The temple has been a symbolic center of Tibetan protests against Chinese rule in Tibet and the Barkhor was a center of Tibetan unrest in 2008 that left at least a dozen people dead.
In May last year, two Tibetans self-immolated in front of the Jokhang.
Outside the city, plans are underway for a U.S.$4.8 billion theme park that rights groups say trivializes Tibetan culture and glosses over the political repression in the region.
Beijing has enhanced security measures and tourism restrictions across the TAR in recent years, but the regional government has said it is aiming to encourage tourism in the area.
According to Chinese state media, some 10 million tourists visited the TAR last year and the regional government is aiming to double the annual number by 2015.
The vast majority of tourism to TAR is domestic, with foreign visitors and journalists frequently barred from entering the region.
Microsoft's Xbox One sales appear to be picking up in the US. Xbox One was the top-selling console in the US during July, August, and September, according to the NPD group. Microsoft still hasn't released updated console sales figures, but EA estimated Microsoft had sold 19 million Xbox Ones back in January. Nvidia recently estimated that Microsoft has reached 29 million Xbox One sales, compared to an estimate of 52 million for PS4. Sony revealed in May that it had sold more than 40 million PS4s.
The uptick in Xbox One sales in the US can be easily attributed to the recent launch of the Xbox One S console, and Microsoft's aggressive pricing for existing consoles. The software giant cut the price of the Xbox One to $249 back in July, after cutting it to $279 in June. Sony's PS4 slim debuted on September 15th, and the PSVR only just launched this week, and both are expected to boost Sony's sales. Sony is also introducing a new PS4 Pro console next month.
Microsoft's strategy might have worked for the summer months, but the real test will the upcoming important holiday sales months. If Microsoft can hold onto a lead over the busy holiday season then it would be fair to say it's turning sales around.

I first understood that something had changed when I received a message to one of my WhatsApp groups saying “Gordon's girlfriend.” This was followed by the snuff video of police officers shooting Asraa Zidan Tawfik Abed, a 30-year-old Palestinian mother from Nazareth. In the video, Asraa is surrounded by Israeli soldiers who are all aiming automatic rifles at her while she sobs and cries out. She clearly poses no threat whatsoever to those around her, and yet suddenly a police officer nonchalantly walks toward her, aims, and shoots, three times. Asraa falls to the ground, while someone in the crowd shouts, “Daughter of a whore!” Ad Policy
The video went viral, and, like so many Jewish Israeli viewers, the person who sent it to my WhatsApp group obviously found the violence amusing. I watched the disturbing footage several times before answering, “This is what woman hunting looks like.”
Two weeks later, an Israeli state prosecutor admitted that Asraa had had no intention of stabbing anyone, but he also added that the policeman who had gunned her down would not be charged. The message to the security forces was unequivocal: Shoot, no questions asked.
The snuff video of Fadi Alon from Jerusalem was even more horrific, and not only because Fadi was murdered by a police officer as he was trying to flee an angry mob, while Asraa was only wounded, but because the mob surrounding Fadi was caught on film taunting the police officers. They are heard demanding an extrajudicial execution while accusing the security forces of being spineless. Watching the police succumb to the mob, I understood for the first time what it must have meant to be in the Roman Colosseum in the midst of the madding crowd.
And, yet, the current situation in Israel is very different. Unlike ancient Rome, in Israel events are framed by a melodramatic political script that thrives on what Elisabeth Anker, following Nietzsche, calls orgies of feeling.
Indeed, the current popularity of snuff media in Israel is the product of a local melodrama industry that solicits intense pathos, which is aimed at encouraging heroic retribution against those considered responsible for so-called national injuries. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the ultimate melodrama king, and he has, throughout his long political career, spun many tales that produce extreme feelings of fear and self-righteousness. THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW!
Netanyahu presents Israel as an always honorable actor and the perpetual victim of villainous actions. For him, goodness is always located in the suffering nation, evil in its antagonists, and heroism in sovereign acts of violence coded as valiant. Such melodramatic framing, as Anker explains in her excellent book, which focuses on post-9/11 politics in the United States, evokes intense visceral responses to supposedly terrible injustices imposed upon the state and its citizenry.
For example, Netanyahu's recent declaration that the mufti of Jerusalem was the one responsible for the Final Solution was aimed at creating a direct link between Palestinians and Nazis in order to produce and exacerbate intense feelings of pain and outrage among Israeli Jews. These emotions are then mobilized to produce the feeling that the state must forcefully punish the culprits. Finally, it also creates what Anker calls a felt legitimacy, the feeling among Jews that any response to the “Palestinian threat” is legitimate.
The fact that a few days ago Netanyahu retracted his original statement about the mufti is inconsequential. The script has already entered the public imaginary, and the environment that encourages violence and further repression has been ramped up yet another notch.
Unsurprisingly, many Palestinian citizens of Israel now refrain from speaking Arabic in public spaces. They have watched enough Israeli snuff films to know that the security forces as well as Jewish vigilantes are allowed to use lethal force with impunity. The melodramatic discourse and the orgies of feelings that Netanyahu and his political allies have managed to produce have been spectacularly successful. And while The New York Times's Isabel Kershner may claim that “the more mainstream Israeli right and left have gravitated over the last two decades toward a less ideological center, approaching some kind of consensus on the Palestinian issue,” in reality a new level of acceptable retributive jingoism has been achieved.
Enner Valencia has issued an apology following recent press coverage
Enner Valencia has issued a clarification following recent press coverage of an interview he conducted in Spanish with a radio station.
Valencia suffered an injury to his right leg in the Europa League match with Astra Giurgiu at the Boleyn Ground last month.
Enner Valencia said: “I have had a number of consultation meetings with specialists in London, accompanied by members of the Club's medical staff, and they have always kept me updated me on my injury.
“It has been a frustrating time, but I would like to make clear that I have the utmost respect and confidence in the Club's medical team and the specialists I was referred to and I would like to apologise to them and the Club for any issues arising from the recent press coverage.
“I will continue to work as hard as I can with them to return to help the team as quickly as possible, and continue the good start I made to the season.
“It is not possible to put an exact date on when I might be back on the pitch, but you can be rest assured that I am motivated to get fit and score more goals for West Ham United as soon as I can.”
I am grateful to have been able to follow the debate over my remarks that were printed in Friends Journal (“Reflections on the Events of September 11,” December 2001). I might add that portions of my remarks, which were abstracted from a speech I gave shortly after the terrorist attacks to a United Church of Christ convention in Washington, D.C., were also excerpted in The Advocate and Soldier of Fortune, as well as Friends Journal. (There cannot be many people like myself—on the mailing lists of all of those publications as well as Martha Stewart Living.) I took some pleasure in directing the small fee that I was owed for publication of my words by Soldier of Fortune to be sent to American Friends Service Committee.
I would like to offer some responses to what many readers wrote. Please understand that I respect every Friend's personal convictions and do not seek to change them. (I rather doubt that anything I say would anyway.) I'd like to think that my own change is the result of working around the world as a journalist for more than two decades, often in zones of conflict. My religious convictions have been knocked about by real life. Many of my experiences have borne out the essential truth of the Peace Testimony. But other encounters—say, in the Balkans, or the war on terrorism—have led me to see ways in which nonviolence, arguably, can abet suffering and the loss of innocent lives. As a reporter and, I hope, still a faithful person, I feel an obligation to share my thinking.
I have come to regret one phrase of my remarks in “Reflections on the Events of September 11.” When I asserted that the hijackers of September 11 “hate us because they are psychotics,” I was unfair—to psychotics. As several readers wrote, psychotics have a genuine mental disorder. It is often the product of a chemical or emotional imbalance. The hijackers of September 11 were mass murderers. As far as I can tell, they were in full possession of their faculties when they massacred 3,000 people.
Many people who responded to my remarks [in the Friends Journal Forum, Feb.-May, July 2002—eds.] made wild representations about the number of people killed by U.S. and Allied bombing in Afghanistan. I find these assertions particularly fantastic because many were advanced while I was in Afghanistan, actually reporting on the war, including civilian casualties.
I tend to hold with the judgment reached by my colleague, Mike Schuster, and the reporters of the New York Times: about 800 Afghan civilians were killed in the U.S.-led military campaign there. Many of those deaths are being investigated. Several have already been ruled a mistake or negligence by the U.S. military. Perhaps a few will be found to be war crimes.
Amnesty International, which I greatly admire, puts the number significantly higher, at about 3,000. I think their number lacks documentation, but I note it with respect. It is, at any rate, still well below the tens of thousands that some Friends Journal readers advanced with certitude.
Now 3,000 lives—or 800—are not negligible. I would not want to be among that 3,000 or 800. I would not want anyone I loved to be among that number. I would not want any stranger to be among those killed.
But I would invite Friends to measure the number of civilians killed in the war to liberate Afghanistan from the grip of the Taliban alongside the number that would have been killed if the Taliban had stayed in power.
I did a story from the Kabul soccer stadium. When the Taliban was in power, thousands of people would be rounded up from the streets of Kabul and locked into that stadium each Friday afternoon. Then, 12, 18, 20, or 25 people would be marched onto the field and executed by Taliban “judges” for various religious crimes. (Perhaps it is needless to add: there were no appeals, no inquiry of a free press, and no F. Lee Bailey or ACLU to file last‐minute appeals.)
Some men and women would be strung up from the goal posts. Others had their hands or legs amputated and were left to bleed their lives out into the grass. Not even in Texas, I suspect, would you get a large crowd of spectators to willingly witness routine executions. The roundup of an audience at gunpoint to watch hangings and butchery were meant to emphasize a message that the thousands who witnessed this weekly crime were intended to bring back to their friends and families: the Taliban rule, and by blood.
If the Taliban had not been displaced, those routine, despicable murders—hundreds of people a year—would have continued. We interviewed the man who had been the chief groundskeeper at the soccer stadium and asked a question that might have struck him as coming from Martians, as much as U.S. citizens: Why did he mop up the blood shed by murderers week after week, and keep reporting for work? “What else could I do?” he asked. “I had no reason to think anything would ever change.”
My crew and I also reported on mass graves in the mountains of Bamiyan province. More than 3,000 people were probably slaughtered and buried in the countryside surrounding the massive Buddha statues that the Taliban used slave labor to destroy—and then killed many of the workers. I doubt that the remaining Hazzara people would have been safe for long; certainly they lived in constant fear.
I saw the kind of world that the al‐Qaida terror network and the Taliban created when they had the chance to build their own society. It is the only kind of society they accept as legitimate and holy. It was a society in which women were chattel; skeptics, doubters, and dissidents of all kinds were imprisoned; and arts, entertainment, sports, and other diversions were forbidden. Gay rights? Don't even think about it. Anyone who doubts that Afghanistan is a better place because of the Allied military intervention should ask him or herself if they had been willing to live as a gay man or woman under the Taliban.
How long would they have treasured peace when it meant their continued enslavement?
There are some Quakers who will say there is no difference between 3,000 people killed by the Taliban and 3,000 killed in Allied bombing. I know the bromides of pacifism. I used to say that kind of thing myself. But I think there's a significant difference.
If the Taliban had stayed in power and were permitted to murder thousands more, Afghanistan today would be even more blighted for having no hope of change. Perhaps 800 or 3,000 innocent civilians died in the military campaign to depose the Taliban. But their families and friends now have a country in which half the people in school are women, half the people in the workforce are women, there is a free press, freedom of worship, freedom not to worship, and a free political system (a political system so free that President Hamid Karzai opposes any U.S. invasion of Iraq). Yes, some warlords are gaining power. Yes, hunger and poverty still stalk the land. But there is also joy, music, culture, and a hope of change that had been crushed before the world was aroused by the events of September 2001 to depose the Taliban.
I have an analogy that is conveniently available in my own family. As some readers may know, my wife is from Normandy. A number of her aunts, uncles, and cousins who grew up during World War II were adolescents at the time of the Allied invasion. They have vivid memories of the British bombing that was ordered to break British and Canadian troops out of the thickly hedged French countryside in which the invasion got ground down. Many of them can recall family friends who died when they got caught up in that bombing. They still grieve when they recall those frightening times. But that grief and loss do not mean that they wish they had spent the rest of their lives under Nazi occupation. They did not expect that brutes would be displaced without bloodshed.
A number of respondents also argued that since U.S. policymakers had, at one point, ignored the crimes of the Taliban, it is inconsistent and hypocritical for the United States to depose them now. This is a fair debater's point, but it is not necessarily a good guide for policy. It was a mistake to overlook the crimes of the Taliban in the mid‐1990s (as it was a mistake to countenance the crimes of Saddam Hussein in the early 1980s). That mistake is only compounded, not relieved, by consistency. As Mahatma Gandhi once observed to someone who he had maddened by changing his mind, “I know more today than I did yesterday.”
I am similarly unconvinced by arguments that try to diminish the moral logic of defeating the Taliban by observing that the U.S. did not intervene in Rwanda; or until it was too late to avoid mass murder in Bosnia and Kosovo. I tend to feel that the United States should have intervened in those places, too (intervention in Bosnia might have even forestalled the slaughter in Kosovo). There is no comfort or honor in seeing lives sacrificed for the sake of intellectual or moral consistency.
I believe that Afghanistan is a better, freer country because of Allied military intervention that defeated the brutal, repressive, women‐enslaving, gay‐bashing theocracy that ruled there and made a home for the training and export of terrorism. I believe that the breakup of some elements of the al‐Qaida terror network has already led to the interruption of several ongoing plots that have saved lives—including, perhaps, the lives of people who opposed military action.
I will not be sidetracked into defending the civil liberties policies of Attorney General John Ashcroft. I will note that it is a remarkable feature of U.S. democracy that a time limit was built into the provisions of the so‐called USA‐Patriot Act, largely at the insistence of conservative Republicans who were alarmed at the potential for misuse in many of those laws.
I don't feel that the entire war on terrorism is discredited by those laws; any more than I feel that the Allied effort to win World War II was altogether discredited by the U.S. incarceration of innocent Japanese‐Americans, the racial segregation in the U.S. military, the bombing of Dresden, or the colonialism of the British Empire—and if there are Friends Journal readers who do not believe that they have grown up in a better, freer world because the Allies were able to defeat the Axis powers in World War II, I doubt that there is much I can say to convince them otherwise. I do know that such a judgment does not make me eager to hear anything else they may have to say.
If you open any daily newspaper, ride a big‐city subway, step into any big‐city public school—or if you attend almost any big‐city Quaker meeting—you still will be impressed by the strength and vigor of diversity, and the state of free expression in the United States.
Over the past year, I not only read the letters sent to Friends Journal, but made a number of appearances at Quaker schools and meetings. It seems to me that many of the people who were eager to confront my views were not acting in the light of the Peace Testimony so much as they were inflexible political ideologues. Some sounded as if they hadn't taken a fresh look at the world or reassessed their own thinking since Joni Mitchell's first Greatest Hits album.
I would not begin to try to convince Friends Journal readers that war is moral. I don't believe that myself. But I do believe that it may sometimes be necessary for survival.
Asia Bennett, former AFSC executive secretary, once told me, “Quakers are very good at recognizing injustice. We are not always good about recognizing evil.” Her observation (even as she might disapprove of the lessons I eventually drew from her wisdom) stayed with me as I covered holocausts and their aftermaths in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. The people who sponsored those crimes often said they had been impelled to act by injustice. But when I looked down into mass graves, or uncovered mutilations, I saw, near as I suppose I will ever recognize it, a force I am no longer diffident about calling evil. In my judgment, too many Quakers have condoned too much violence and nonsense because its perpetrators have been shrewd enough to invoke injustice as their inspiration.
Peace activism has a history that can be as tarnished as war. While I was researching my most recent book, I found it instructive to read accounts of some of the most prominent peace activists of the 1930s:
Charles A. Lindbergh said that Germany was rearming and expanding only to redress the injustice of the Versailles Peace Accords; the Nazis were nationalists who would be sated once they had a little satisfaction (say, Czechoslovakia). He said that Jewish interests were driving the democracies toward war.
George Bernard Shaw said that the United Kingdom and United States did not have the moral standing to oppose Germany because British colonialism and U.S. economic imperialism were greater sources of injustice in the world.
I concluded that what saved peace advocacy from being totally discredited was the German invasion of the USSR (which forced the left to reassess its conviction that only capitalist colonialist countries were at risk), Pearl Harbor (which forced the right to reassess its certainty that it was possible to stay clear of conflict), and the atom bomb (which made urgent the need to develop peaceful alternatives).
Millions of brave people risked their lives to devise those alternatives—and they shook the world.
Nonviolent resistance won Mahatma Gandhi's campaign for independence in India. Love in action, embodied by the Birmingham Children's Crusade and the march of Martin Luther King Jr. and the heroes of the U.S. civil rights movement into the crush of water cannon and police dogs, overthrew the laws of segregation that made too much of the United States a living prison. Corazon Aquino's campaign to oust dictatorship, Mitch Snyder's fasts to focus concern on homelessness—the Peace Testimony still has much to offer the world.
But peace does not always hold every answer, any more than military action. Peace advocates who excuse the crimes of al‐Qaida as their response to injustice while excoriating the force the United States uses in its own defense as unjustified terrorism are putting their moral weight on the same side of the scale as murderers. Urging peace at any price will leave terrorists in place and insure more crimes of terrorism in our immediate future. And when terrorists strike they will make no distinctions between Quakers and Pentagon generals, inner‐city school teachers or B‐2 bomber pilots, busboys or bankers, John Ashcroft or Noam Chomsky. Pacifism can assist spilling the blood of innocents, too.
I thank Friends Journal readers for their responses. And again, I thank the various Quaker assemblies that not only have received me with such courtesy over this past year, but actually have sought me out to share my views that they knew to be at odds with those of their own membership.

Did you know that the UN is planning to launch a “new universal agenda” for humanity in September 2015? That phrase does not come from me – it is actually right in the very first paragraph of the official document that every UN member nation will formally approve at a conference later this month. The entire planet is going to be committing to work toward 17 sustainable development goals and 169 specific sustainable development targets, and yet there has been almost a total media blackout about this here in the United States. The UN document promises that this plan will “transform our world for the better by 2030“, and yet very few Americans have even heard of the 2030 Agenda at this point. Instead, most of us seem to be totally obsessed with the latest celebrity gossip or the latest nasty insults that our puppet politicians have been throwing around at one another. It absolutely amazes me that more people cannot understand that Agenda 2030 is a really, really big deal. When will people finally start waking up?
As I discussed in a previous article, the 2030 Agenda is taking the principles and goals laid out in Agenda 21 to an entirely new level. Agenda 21 was primarily focused on the environment, but the 2030 Agenda addresses virtually all areas of human activity. It truly is a blueprint for global governance.
And later this month, nearly every nation on the entire planet is going to be signing up for this new agenda. The general population of the planet is going to be told that this agenda is “voluntary” and that it is all about “ending poverty” and “fighting climate change”, but that is not the full story. Unfortunately, there is so much positive spin around this plan that most people will not be able to see through it. Just check out an excerpt from a piece that was published on the official UN website yesterday…
The United Nations General Assembly today approved a resolution sending the draft ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development' to Member States for adoption later this month, bringing the international community “to the cusp of decisions that can help realize the… dream of a world of peace and dignity for all,” according to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. “Today is the start of a new era. We have travelled a long way together to reach this turning point,” declared Mr. Ban, recounting the path the international community has taken over the 15 years since the adoption of the landmark Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) towards crafting a set of new, post-2015 sustainability goals that will aim to ensure the long-term well-being of our planet and its people. With world leaders expected to adopt the text at a 25-27 September summit in New York, the UN chief said Agenda 2030 aims high, seeking to put people at the centre of development; foster human well-being, prosperity, peace and justice on a healthy planet and pursue respect for the human rights of all people and gender equality.
Who doesn't “dream of a world of peace and dignity for all”?
They make it all sound so wonderful and non-threatening.
They make it sound like we are about to enter a global utopia in which poverty and inequality will finally be eradicated. This is from the preamble of the official 2030 Agenda document…
This Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. We recognise that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. All countries and all stakeholders, acting in collaborative partnership, will implement this plan. We are resolved to free the human race from the tyranny of poverty and want and to heal and secure our planet. We are determined to take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. As we embark on this collective journey, we pledge that no one will be left behind. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets which we are announcing today demonstrate the scale and ambition of this new universal Agenda.
If it is a “universal agenda”, then where does that leave those that do not want to be part of it?
How will they assure that “no one will be left behind” if there are some nations or groups that are not willing to go along with their plan?
The heart of the 2030 Agenda is a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals…
Goal 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere
Goal 2 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Goal 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Goal 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all
Goal 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
Goal 6 Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Goal 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all
Goal 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
Goal 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
Goal 10 Reduce inequality within and among countries
Goal 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
Goal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
Goal 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts*
Goal 14 Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
Goal 15 Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
Goal 16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels
Goal 17 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
Once again, many of those sound quite good.
But what do many of those buzzwords actually mean to the elite?
For instance, what does “sustainable development” actually mean, and how does the UN plan to ensure that it will be achieved globally?
This is something that was discussed in a recent WND article…
But what is “sustainable development?” Patrick Wood, an economist and author of “Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation,” says it's clear the U.N. and its supporters see sustainable development as more than just the way to a cleaner environment. They see it as the vehicle for creating a long-sought new international economic order, or “New World Order.” Wood's new book traces the modern technocracy movement to Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller and the Trilateral Commission in the early 1970s.
And Wood is quite correct. The environment is a perfect vehicle for the elite to use to bring in their version of utopia, because just about every possible form of human activity affects the environment in some way. Ultimately, they hope to centrally plan and strictly regulate virtually everything that we do, and we will be told that it is necessary to “save the planet”.
And they will never come out and openly call it a “New World Order” because “sustainable development” sounds so much nicer and is so much more acceptable to the general population.
Needless to say, there wouldn't be much room for individual liberty, freedom or good, old-fashioned capitalism in the world that the elite are trying to set up. In fact, the U.N.'s number one sustainable development official has essentially publicly admitted this…
“This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model, for the first time in human history,” Figueres, who heads up the U.N.'s Framework Convention on Climate Change, told reporters in February. “This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for the at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution,” Figueres said.
They plan to “intentionally transform the economic development model”?
And so what will this new system look like?
How will they achieve this “utopia” that they are promising us?
Sadly, they are just selling the same lies that have been sold to people for thousands of years. Paul McGuire, the co-author of a new book entitled “The Babylon Code: Solving the Bible's Greatest End-Times Mystery“, commented on this recently…
Deep inside every man and woman is the longing for a far better world, a world without war, disease, death, and pain. Our present world is a cruel world in which every life ends in death. From the beginning of time Mankind has sought to use science and technology to create a perfect world, what some would call Utopia or Paradise. As the Human Race began to organize itself, a Scientific or Technocratic Elite rose to power by promising the masses that they could build this perfect world. Ancient Babylon represented the first historical attempt to build paradise on earth.
In ancient times, Babylon was the very first attempt to create a type of “global government”, and ever since then the global elite have been trying to recreate what Babylon started.
The promise is always the same – the elite swear that they have finally figured out how to create a perfect society without poverty or war. But in the end all of these attempts at utopia always end up degenerating into extreme forms of tyranny.
On September 25th, the Pope is traveling to New York to give the opening address at the conference where the 2030 Agenda will be launched. He will be urging all of humanity to support what the UN is trying to do. There are countless millions that implicitly trust the Pope, and they will buy what he is selling hook, line and sinker.
Don't be fooled – the 2030 Agenda is a blueprint for a New World Order. Just read the document for yourself, and imagine what our world would actually look like if they have their way.
They want to fundamentally transform our planet, and the freedom that you are enjoying today is simply not acceptable. To the elite, giving people freedom and liberty is dangerous because they believe it hurts the environment and causes societal chaos. According to their way of thinking, the only way to have the kind of harmonious utopia that they are shooting for is to tightly regulate and control what everyone is thinking, saying and doing. Their solutions always involve more central planning and more control in their own hands.
So what do you think?
Should we hand the global elite that kind of power and control?
If not, then we all need to start speaking out about this insidious agenda while we still can.
It might be lost amongst all the other storylines of late, but the Canucks' penalty kill is on a roll. Over the last five games, the Canucks have only allowed just one power play goal.
It helps that the Canucks have been more disciplined recently, only taking 13 penalties in the last five games, but killing 12 of 13 penalties is still very good.
article continues below
They've notably managed to do this while missing a defenceman who was meant to be a key penalty killer: Erik Gudbranson. He's been out of the lineup for the last six games, but even adding that extra game only means one more power play goal against.
It's a pretty small sample size, so I'm certainly not suggesting that Gudbranson being out of the lineup is the cause of the improved penalty kill. In fact, their other best 5-game stretches on the penalty kill have come with Gudbranson in the lineup. They killed 17-of-19 in the first five games of the season, 15-of-16 during a stretch in October, and 14-of-15 in mid-November.
I am suggesting, however, that the Canucks' other defencemen have ably filled the gaps in the penalty kill left by injuries this season. One of the defencemen that has done best filling in might come as a surprise: Ben Hutton. In fact, there's an argument to be made that he has been the Canucks' best penalty killer this season.
Before the start of the season, I made the argument that Ben Hutton could and perhaps should play a larger role, including time on the penalty kill. He wasn't one of their go-to options to start the season, however. Instead, Alex Edler, Chris Tanev, Erik Gudbranson, and Michael Del Zotto led the Canucks in shorthanded ice time early on.
But Hutton was forced into shorthanded action before too long, however, with Edler, Tanev, and now Gudbranson all missing time due to injuries.
Hutton doesn't immediately strike most Canucks fans as someone who would be good on the penalty kill. He has some defensive deficiencies at even-strength, generally when he gets caught flat-footed and tries to use his stick to defend instead of taking the body.
But defending at even-strength and defending on the penalty kill are two entirely different things. On the penalty kill, Hutton's active and aggressive stick is a plus, disrupting passing lanes and creating opportunities for turnovers. When you look at the statistics, Hutton isn't just good; he's remarkable.
Here are the five Canucks defencemen who have played at least 30 minutes on the penalty kill this season and the rate of shot attempts (corsi), unblocked shot attempts (fenwick), shots on goal, scoring chances, and goals that the Canucks give up when they are on the ice. All data comes from Natural Stat Trick.
Player TOI CA/60 FA/60 SA/60 SCA/60 GA/60 Ben Hutton 61.33 78.26 60.65 40.11 47.93 7.83 Christopher Tanev 67.15 90.25 67.91 42.89 54.50 6.25 Alexander Edler 37.93 98.07 71.18 45.87 66.43 7.91 Erik Gudbranson 45.68 105.07 80.12 61.73 56.48 10.51 Michael Del Zotto 61.38 107.52 83.08 63.54 60.60 8.80
I also highlighted the best player in each statistic, but there's almost no point in doing so: Hutton leads the way in almost every category. The only statistic he doesn't lead all Canucks defencemen in on the penalty kill is goals against, and he's second behind Chris Tanev.
That means that the Canucks give up fewer shot attempts, unblocked shot attempts, shots on goal, and scoring chances when Hutton is on the penalty kill than any other defenceman. That comes as somewhat of a surprise.
At the bottom of the chart, meanwhile, is Michael Del Zotto, but I've covered his penalty kill struggles already http://www.vancourier.com/pass-it-to-bulis/pk-problems-michael-del-zotto-and-bo-horvat-should-probably-get-less-shorthanded-ice-time-1.23096975. What's troubling is that Gudbranson is not far ahead of him in any category and has been on the ice for the highest rate of goals against on the penalty kill.
But let's focus on the positive: Hutton hasn't just been good among Canucks defencemen; he's among the league leaders among defencemen on the penalty kill.
Player CA/60 FA/60 SA/60 SCA/60 GA/60 Ben Hutton 78.26 60.65 40.11 47.93 7.83 Kris Russell 82.05 58.45 47.21 47.21 12.36 Esa Lindell 82.12 66.79 47.08 48.18 6.57 Jamie Oleksiak 82.41 65.62 41.2 45.78 6.1 Matt Hunwick 83.76 58.33 47.86 49.36 7.48 P.K. Subban 84.01 60.74 46.53 42.65 7.75 Oliver Ekman-Larsson 84.02 62.15 47.19 37.98 5.75 Carl Gunnarsson 84.51 75.29 55.31 49.17 7.68 Jeff Petry 85.3 57.7 44.32 42.65 6.69 Brenden Dillon 86.45 69.83 58.74 54.31 3.33 Jake McCabe 86.7 59.21 40.18 49.69 4.23 Ryan Murray 86.89 65.5 52.14 33.42 5.35 Brent Burns 87.41 71.31 62.11 59.81 2.3 Alexei Emelin 87.44 63.05 51.28 47.92 9.25 Matt Niskanen 87.85 59.13 45.61 42.23 6.76 John Klingberg 88.24 71.95 48.87 55.66 2.71 Ben Lovejoy 89 65.64 44.5 52.29 3.34 Stephen Johns 89.38 68.19 43.31 45.15 9.21 Kris Letang 89.6 63.9 45.84 40.98 4.17 Marc Methot 90.04 77.69 49.44 63.56 3.53
These are the top-20 defencemen in the NHL in shot attempts against per hour. Leading the way: Ben Hutton. He's also first when it comes to shots on goal and is sixth in unblocked shot attempts.
Hutton is further down the list when it comes to scoring chances at 22nd and drops a little further when it comes to goals against, but with those two statistics the small sample size comes into play, particularly when it comes to goals. I am inclined to weigh the shot statistics a little more heavily and in those Hutton is literally one of the best in the NHL.
It's not just these shot and goal statistics where Hutton looks good on the penalty kill. He also ranks highly in several micro stats. According to Jeremy Davis over at Canucks Army, Hutton is also the best Canucks defenceman at gaining control of the puck on the penalty kill and has a solid rate of clearing the puck when he does gain possession.
At the time of Davis's article, the Canucks were clearing the puck 87.5% of the time when Hutton gained possession on the penalty kill. That led all Canucks defencemen. Gudbranson was not far behind at 85.7%, but there's a distinct difference: Hutton gained possession of the puck at a vastly superior rate to Gudbranson.
Davis found that Hutton gained the puck 76.5 times per hour, the best rate on the team, while Gudbranson did the same 19.9 times per hour, the worst rate on the team. That is a huge difference and it means the Canucks were far more likely to clear the puck with Hutton on the penalty kill than Gudbranson, despite their similar team clearance percentages.
There's one caveat with these micro stats: they come in a very small sample size, as Davis's article was written at the end of October. Still, they support what the macro stats — shot attempts, shots on goal, etc. — have to say about Hutton's effectiveness on the penalty kill.
So what does this mean? Primarily, it means that when Erik Gudbranson returns, Hutton should not be the one taken out of the penalty kill rotation; instead, Michael Del Zotto should likely be the one to take a step back.
But it also means that Hutton is far better in shorthanded situations than most would expect.
HONG KONG — Whenever China's economy swooned in recent downturns, its currency never buckled. It held steady, or strengthened, even as China's neighbors or trading partners scrambled to cut the value of their own currencies to deal with the fallout.
With the Chinese renminbi now taking its biggest plunge in decades, the worry is that the country's already slowing economy is even worse off than reported and that the government is panicking. On Thursday, China allowed the renminbi to weaken significantly for a third consecutive day.
The situation is shaking the aura of supremacy surrounding President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party, which has portrayed a sense of ultimate authority. But the Chinese government's response to the country's financial woes is creating concerns about its ability to manage a slowdown.
“People are used to growth and rising living standards,” said Jonathan Fenby, an author and co-founder of the research firm Trusted Sources. “But now they are in a ‘real' world, and the leadership has to convince them both that slower growth is in their long-term interests and that it is in control.”
Long-term treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics decreased levels of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and activated inflammatory microglial cells in the brains of mice in a new study by neuroscientists from the University of Chicago.
The study, published July 21, 2016, in Scientific Reports, also showed significant changes in the gut microbiome after antibiotic treatment, suggesting the composition and diversity of bacteria in the gut play an important role in regulating immune system activity that impacts progression of Alzheimer's disease.
"We're exploring very new territory in how the gut influences brain health," said Sangram Sisodia, PhD, Thomas Reynolds Sr. Family Professor of Neurosciences at the University of Chicago and senior author of the study. "This is an area that people who work with neurodegenerative diseases are going to be increasingly interested in, because it could have an influence down the road on treatments."
Two of the key features of Alzheimer's disease are the development of amyloidosis, accumulation of amyloid-ß (Aß) peptides in the brain, and inflammation of the microglia, brain cells that perform immune system functions in the central nervous system. Buildup of Aß into plaques plays a central role in the onset of Alzheimer's, while the severity of neuro-inflammation is believed to influence the rate of cognitive decline from the disease.
For this study, Sisodia and his team administered high doses of broad-spectrum antibiotics to mice over five to six months. At the end of this period, genetic analysis of gut bacteria from the antibiotic-treated mice showed that while the total mass of microbes present was roughly the same as in controls, the diversity of the community changed dramatically. The antibiotic-treated mice also showed more than a two-fold decrease in Aß plaques compared to controls, and a significant elevation in the inflammatory state of microglia in the brain. Levels of important signaling chemicals circulating in the blood were also elevated in the treated mice.
While the mechanisms linking these changes is unclear, the study points to the potential in further research on the gut microbiome's influence on the brain and nervous system.
"We don't propose that a long-term course of antibiotics is going to be a treatment--that's just absurd for a whole number of reasons," said Myles Minter, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Neurobiology at UChicago and lead author of the study. "But what this study does is allow us to explore further, now that we're clearly changing the gut microbial population and have new bugs that are more prevalent in mice with altered amyloid deposition after antibiotics."
The study is the result of one the first collaborations from the Microbiome Center, a joint effort by the University of Chicago, the Marine Biological Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory to support scientists at all three institutions who are developing new applications and tools to understand and harness the capabilities of microbial systems across different fields. Sisodia, Minter and their team worked with Eugene B. Chang, Martin Boyer Professor of Medicine at UChicago, and Vanessa Leone, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in Chang's lab, to analyze the gut microbes of the mice in this study.
Minter said the collaboration was enabling, and highlighted the cross-disciplinary thinking necessary to tackle a seemingly intractable disease like Alzheimer's. "Once you put ideas together from different fields that have largely long been believed to be segregated from one another, the possibilities are really amazing," he said.
Sisodia cautioned that while the current study opens new possibilities for understanding the role of the gut microbiome in Alzheimer's disease, it's just a beginning step.
"There's probably not going to be a cure for Alzheimer's disease for several generations, because we know there are changes occurring in the brain and central nervous system 15 to 20 years before clinical onset," he said. "We have to find ways to intervene when a patient starts showing clinical signs, and if we learn how changes in gut bacteria affect onset or progression, or how the molecules they produce interact with the nervous system, we could use that to create a new kind of personalized medicine."

The study, "Antibiotic-induced perturbations in gut microbial diversity influences neuro-inflammation and amyloidosis in a murine model of Alzheimer's disease," was supported by the Cure Alzheimer's Fund and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Additional authors include Daina Ringus, Xiaoqiong Zhang, Paul Oyler-Castrillo, and Mark Musch from the University of Chicago; Can Zhang, Joseph Ward, and Rudolph Tanzi from Massachusetts General Hospital; and Fan Liao and David Holtzman from Washington University.

Melbourne man jailed for using internet to sexually abuse children living in poverty in Philippines
Posted
A Melbourne man who used the internet to exploit and abuse dozens of young children living in poverty in the Philippines has been sentenced to 11 years in jail.
Patrick Goggins, 68, pleaded guilty to more than 20 offences, including persistent abuse of a child overseas, and making and distributing child pornography.
The most serious offences involved victims as young as three years old.
The court heard most of the victims were young girls, although some young boys were also involved.
They were living in poverty and desperate for money.
Thousands of child pornography files were taken from Goggins's computer in a raid by the Australian Federal Police last year.
Without people like you, there would be no need for children to be exploited and degraded. Judge Sandra Davis
The Victorian County Court heard Goggins did not visit the Philippines but abused and directed the children via the internet from his home.
The court heard after he was caught Goggins told police he was "bloody stupid" but said there was "nothing wrong" with what he had done.
He told police he was "only watching, not physically doing anything" and he was "merely sponsoring the girls for money".
Goggins told police he did not want to seem like a "soft touch" by giving the children money for nothing.
Goggins showed no regard for welfare of children: judge
The court heard Goggins also claimed the girls he was exploiting were already a product of a market that they had been exposed to and he did not introduce them to it.
But in sentencing, Judge Sandra Davis said he had shown no remorse or regard for the children's welfare.
"These are very serious offences," she said.
"[They're] encouraged because of a market. Without people like you, there would be no need for children to be exploited and degraded.
"There were many victims, particularly victims overseas, that you paid and were willing to exploit for your own gratification."
Judge Davis described Goggins as immature and "a high risk of re-offending".
"This was not an isolated incident. The nature, content and volume was very serious indeed. The level of culpability is high," Judge Davis said.
His lawyers told the court Goggins had suffered from severe post traumatic stress disorder from his time as an infantry rifleman in the Vietnam War.
The court heard Goggins had an extensive history of offending, including a previous prison term for taking photographs of young girls changing into their bathers.
He was also convicted of numerous upskirting offences and was previously charged with failing to answer bail, failing to appear in court and indecent assault.
Goggins was scheduled to be sentenced a fortnight ago, but twice failed to appear in court.
His lawyer told the court he had complained of chest pain and taken himself to hospital.
Goggins will be eligible for parole in 2022 and will be a registered serious sex offender for life.

This evening, fans in New York and Los Angeles attended what they thought was going to be a preview of footage from 20th Century Fox's upcoming superhero pic Deadpool. Instead, they were treated to an unfinished version of the whole movie. Yep, Deadpool has screened folks, and the first reactions from this admittedly select group of fans are highly positive. One even goes so far as to call it the best Marvel adaptation yet, with self-proclaimed fans of the source material saying they're incredibly pleased with the resulting film from director Tim Miller.
Star Ryan Reynolds was at the New York screening, while Miller was in attendance at the Los Angeles screening alongside co-stars T.J. Miller and Briana Hildebrand, creator Rob Liefeld, screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, producer Simon Kinberg, and comics legend Stan Lee. This has been, of course, a passion project for Miller and Reynolds, and it's all the more impressive that it finally came to fruition in its purest form: as an R-rated superhero movie. Deadpool marks a major step for the superhero genre as a whole, carving out what could become a new niche in the superhero movie realm that allows filmmakers to tackle more difficult or adult material in the form of an R-rated film. That this comes from 20th Century Fox, and is an official piece of the studio's interconnected X-Men franchise, is incredibly exciting, and folks are certainly looking at Deadpool's performance to see if this kind of gamble can pave the way for future entries in the genre.
For now, the fan response from these surprise screenings is certainly positive. I'm curious to see what the critical response to the film will be, seeing as how it's still a fairly tough sell and will likely need strong word of mouth to reach the box office heights of many of its PG-13 contemporaries. This fan screening is getting things off to a strong start, and as a big fan of the marketing materials thus far, I continue to have high hopes.
Read the responses from Twitter below. We'll update the article if more reactions come in. Deadpool opens in theaters on February 12th.
Education is not the solution for poverty, injustice or even ignorance. Education is an opportunity — no more, no less — for each individual student to work their hardest to escape these evils. If we actually want to improve Education, we have to accept this.
When we lose sight of the fact we're here to provide opportunities, we spend billions on redundant exams and unneeded curriculum changes while dissolving libraries (to save mere millions) and failing to prepare teachers properly for the constant change. We spend billions to fulfill the demand for guaranteed outcomes, when nearly any guarantee in Education outcomes is a fantasy; most variables are outside our control.
I think it's obvious this trend stems from businesspeople lobbying and advising our government to run Education like a business. I actually think the people wanting to run schools like businesses are overwhelmingly well-intentioned — with some exceptions — but it doesn't work. I've lived in both worlds, and they are extremely different. By nature, businesses have much tighter control of their input and processes. When you hire someone, you choose the person you think has the best chance for success and tell the other applicants (nicely) to hit the road. When an employee disrupts your business processes, you might fire them. If someone is valuable to your company, you have powerful incentives at your disposal like raises or bonuses to retain them.
But schools are not factories, students aren't widgets, and they certainly aren't our employees. Students have minds of their own. They have different backgrounds, aptitudes, desires and work ethics. In Education, we can't (and shouldn't be able to) hire and fire them, give them raises, or control their study habits, strengths and weaknesses.
And since students are the only ones who live with the privileges or consequences arising from their performance, all we can do — and must do — is ensured we provide students with the best opportunities possible, and encourage them to take advantage. But we still can't guarantee any level of student success, because the rest is up to them.
Administrators say, “Kids don't read much; why should we provide libraries for books to collect dust?” Administrators say, “Kids never take their textbooks home to study, why should we buy a book to issue to each student?” Even if many kids don't use these resources, it doesn't matter. If we are to reasonably provide children with the best opportunities, all of them should have the choice to take a book home for a couple of weeks (as I've pointed out numerous times, restoring librarians would be incredibly cheap), or their textbook home at night, and read it. Whether or not they do so, is up to them. Education is here to provide opportunities, not make guarantees.
I am not pretending that all, or (let's be honest teachers), even most students are conscientious enough to take full advantage. That doesn't matter, because the children who have (or develop) initiative should have the choice to better themselves. To take a textbook home, and study. To take a vocational book home, and get started on learning a trade. To take a novel home, learn to love reading and become better readers (And who knows? Reading scores might even improve if you provide kids books to read). Whether or not kids do so, is up to them. Some will, many won't. We hope and strive to encourage as many children as possible to do so.
I say this with the firm belief that we have already won 90% of the battle in Education over the past century with two strokes of the pen (Child Labor Laws/Compulsory Education Laws) and the struggle to enforce one Supreme Court decision that sets the ideal of equal opportunity for all (Brown v. Board of Education).
Yes, there are legitimate concerns and debates, but they pale in comparison to progress already made. The opportunity is there for the taking; parents and students must seize it. And as anyone who runs any kind of enterprise should know, unnecessary or improperly applied changes are at least as likely to harm than help. For this reason, I advocate common-sense boosts and moving spending towards the work of teachers and students, rather than sweeping reform that shifts spending towards administration and exam publishers. A bit of calming down all the way around may be what we need. This is much easier when we acknowledge Education is not the solution, but an opportunity for all.

For the past few weeks I've been keeping half an eye on Todd “legitimate rape” Akin's Senate race in Missouri. This is mostly for reasons of personal vanity: I want to see if my three-part Akin prediction pans out. Yesterday was the last day he could withdraw from the race, and he didn't, which means that prediction #1 is now safely in the bank. Prediction #2 is that once Akin is definitively the Republican candidate, Republicans will grudgingly start to offer him their support. So how's that going? Well, the head of the NSRC has now switched from insisting that Akin will never get a dime to saying that he will “continue to monitor this race closely in the days ahead.” Dave Weigel explains:
“Monitor this race closely” is Washington-speak for “maybe spend money on it.” Basically, Republicans bluffed and threatened Akin with a total cut-off because they wanted to replace him with a similar but less unpopular candidate. Akin, who owed national Republicans absolutely nothing — even Sarah Palin endorsed somebody else! — called the bluff. Now that the national spotlight has swung away, Republicans are looking for the least embarrassing way to help out Akin again, because it's tough to lose Missouri and win the Senate. Today's double-team Akin endorsement from Rick Santorum and Jim DeMint was part of that. So was Newt Gingrich's campaign swing. The margin between Akin and Claire McCaskill is only as big as a $500,000 Super PAC check from Foster Friess or Sheldon Adelson.
Prediction #3, of course, is that Akin will eventually eke out a close victory.1 There's nothing new to report on that front, though, since there haven't been any recent polls in Missouri. But the RCP average has Akin behind by about five points, which isn't a lot for a guy fresh off a major gaffe and short of money. Let a little time go by, and give his campaign a cash infusion, and that's not an insurmountable deficit. Not in Missouri, anyway. We'll see.
1I assume this goes without saying, but this is a prediction, not a hope.
Clinton struck a similar theme at another recent speech, according to an attendee. | AP Photos Clinton: VP didn't back bin Laden raid
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday took some indirect swipes at Vice President Joe Biden at an off-the-record gathering, a state representative in attendance told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
“I know she's running for president now, because toward the end, she was asked about the Osama bin Laden raid. She took 25 minutes to answer,” George State Rep. Tom Taylor told the newspaper. “Without turning the knife too deeply, she put it to [Vice President Joe] Biden.”
Story Continued Below
Clinton, a top potential 2016 contender, addressed the National Association of Convenience Stores in Atlanta on Tuesday, where “social media, photography, recording, writing about and/or videotaping” was prohibited, according to guidance released a day earlier.
( PHOTOS: Who's talking about Hillary 2016?)
But Taylor told the newspaper that while answering the question about bin Laden, Clinton depicted herself and former CIA Director Leon Panetta as champions of the raid, while also noting Biden's opposition to the action. Biden is also a potential 2016 hopeful.
“She took the rest of the time and went over, answering that question,” Taylor, a Republican, said. “She was ready to speak on that.”
Clinton struck a similar theme at another recent speech before the Long Island Association, according to an attendee.
She was asked about bin Laden at that event as well, and in her telling, the attendee said, “She and the CIA director were for the attack, and Biden and the secretary of defense were against the attack.”
She also said that wives and children who were vulnerable during the attack were moved “to a safe location so they wouldn't be hurt,” a fact she suggested media accounts had not discussed, the attendee said.

Representatives for Biden and Clinton did not offer comment to POLITICO.
In Atlanta, Clinton also discussed health care and the battles playing out in Congress, the report said, citing sources.

EMMA ALBERICI, PRESENTER: A law firm is facing more than 70 separate court cases over allegations it overcharged former clients, most of whom were accident victims, Keddies Lawyers, which has now been taken over by Slater & Gordon. Former Keddies partners have already paid back over a million dollars to former clients and there's speculation that the final bill could hit $10 million.
Lateline has obtained internal Keddies documents that shed light on some of their controversial billing practices, as Steve Cannane reports.
STEVE CANNANE, REPORTER: Law firm Slater & Gordon has a reputation for standing up for the underdog, representing victims of asbestos, thalidomide and tobacco. But last year when they bought Keddies Lawyers for $35 million, they acquired a firm mired in allegations of over-charging the most vulnerable.
PAUL HENNESSY, FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT: It's the most disreputable I've seen in a career that stretches back almost 50 years. It's the worst professional behaviour by far.
STEVE CANNANE: Keddies specialised in compensation law, no win, no fee cases for accident victims who struggled to afford legal representation.
KEDDIES LAWYERS TV ADVERTISEMENT (voiceover by Paul 'Fatty' Vautin): Keddies has been protecting people's rights for nearly 30 years. They specialise in compensation law. It's all they do.
STEVE CANNANE: But now Keddies partners are facing a number of court cases over claims of over-charging.
STEPHEN FIRTH, FIRTHS LAWYERS: They've already paid back to our clients in excess of a million dollars and we've still got a long way to go. ... It may be close to $10 million by the finish.
STEVE CANNANE: Stephen Firth is representing around 100 former Keddies clients. He says there are even examples of Keddies lawyers billing for more than 24 hours in a single day.
STEPHEN FIRTH: I think the record is we saw one solicitor claim he had spent 33 hours in one matter on one day, which can't be right.
STEVE CANNANE: Mohammed Tariq took to the streets to protest his Keddies bills.
MOHAMMED TARIQ, FORMER KEDDIES CLIENT: We travelled to city, which is Goulburn Street, which is 1.8 kilometres from Redfern to Goulburn Street and Keddies Lawyers charged me $600 for the trip. A cheque was sent to me by the insurance company for the sum of $227.55 and the Keddies charged me $245 to release that cheque.
STEVE CANNANE: These examples of overcharging were picked up in itemised statements like this one. But Lateline has obtained internal Keddies emails that show that bills blew out well beyond what was itemised at settlement.
This Keddies result form shows that the WIP, or work in progress, was $200,000 at the settlement of the case, but the final bill was nearly $380,000.
Forensic accountant Paul Hennessy has represented around 20 former Keddies clients.
PAUL HENNESSY: Typically, the memorandum of costs will follow the accumulation of the work in progress. In my experience, it's most unusual to see an uplift of the type shown as per those schedules.
STEVE CANNANE: Lateline has cross-checked 12 separate Keddies results forms. In each case the itemised bill increased significantly; in four instances by over $100,000 each. Lateline has also obtained an email that shows Keddies founder Russell Keddie instructing his solicitors on ways they can "value add", as he puts it, to their client's bills.
RUSSELL KEDDIE, FORMER KEDDIES PARTNER (excertp from email, male voiceover): "Would you all mind adding 12 units at partners rates for 'Analysis of and Considering Strategy' to all those matters that a Partner responds to you and adds an issue or two. Thanks - we should be rewarded for the brainstorming ...".
STEPHEN FIRTH: Well, Steve, what this tells you is that the partner is directing - that's Russell Keddie - is directing his solicitors that whenever they discuss any client's matter with one of the partners they are automatically to record 72 minutes of time having been spent on that regardless of whether it took five minutes, 10 minutes or 20 minutes. 72 minutes was always to be logged to the client's account for that.
STEVE CANNANE: And at a partner's rate that would be quite high.
STEPHEN FIRTH: At the partner's rate, which might be $390, $400 an hour, perhaps more.
STEVE CANNANE: The three partners of Keddies were Russell Keddie, Scott Roulstone and Tony Barakat.
Former Keddies clients are frustrated by the lack of action taken against them by the Legal Services Commissioner.
MOHAMMED TARIQ: The Legal Services Commissioner has taken no action against Keddies. There has been so many complaints, but he has done nothing about it.
STEVE CANNANE: The Legal Services Commissioner in NSW has received dozens of complaints against Keddies. Just one of them has been referred to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal. That case has yet to be heard.
The commissioner would not address specific cases, but says it's difficult for him to deal with allegations of overcharging.
STEVE MARK, NSW LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSIONER: It is very difficult in our jurisdiction to kind of package all those complaints up which common sense would suggest you should and then run what would be called a course of conduct complaint in the tribunal. Those don't work. The tribunal looks at individual issues.
STEVE CANNANE: In one decision involving Keddies, the commissioner absolved a solicitor of responsibility because the firm's accountants had drawn up the bill.
NSW LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSIONER (male voiceover): "I am of the view that, as an employee, Mr Marocchi was entitled to rely on his firm's accounting systems ...".
STEVE CANNANE: The commissioner hopes new legislation will give him extra powers.
None of the former Keddies partners were available to talk on camera. One of them, Tony Barakat, provided the following statement:
TONY BARAKAT, FORMER KEDDIES PARTNER (male voiceover): "I am unable to comment on the information used to base the Lateline programme because of the matters that are pending to be heard in the Supreme Court and the ADT. As a consequence, the information used shows a one-sided version of events and contains many inaccuracies and half truths."
STEVE CANNANE: Slater & Gordon, who bought Keddies last year, were not available for comment. At the time of purchase, they said the deal represented a new line in the sand for Keddies and a new way of operating.
Steve Cannane, Lateline.
In the trailer above, you'll hear our opening narration by Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords), recurring guest stars Paul F. Tompkins (Mr. Show, Thrilling Adventure Hour), Cecil Baldwin (Welcome to Night Vale) and Kevin Allison (Risk, The State), our theme song by The Doubleclicks, and our host De Anne Dubin. They join more than 60 other performers from around the world who have spent the last 16 months creating Big Data, a nine hour radio play podcast miniseries about stealing the internet.
As soon as I heard the true story of the seven keys to the internet, I knew that it would make an amazing series of heists. Did you know that IN REAL LIFE, in order to make sure no one country has too much control over the internet, there are seven people from seven parts of the world with keys to control it? They have to meet with those keys every three months in a steel cage covered in retinal scanners and earthquake sensors to do an elaborate ceremony that keeps the internet working. That is a real thing. And that's just the BEGINNING of how it all works. This show is about what would happen if someone were to steal those keys. it's a series of heists, taking place all over the world... ranging from hijacking top secret military satellites, to stealing a dude's pants. It's a story about how hacking affects our world... but without a single actual hacker anywhere to be found.
Whether you pledge or not, Big Data will be available to all as a free podcast. No ads, no paywall, no nothing. Just fun crimes for all. Kickstarter backers, however, will get all nine episodes in advance, so that they can binge-listen to their heart's content and feel superior to those muggles that are stuck trying to solve the mystery week-by-week.
Each episode features a segment with our recurring host characters, as well as the stand-alone heist story they've uncovered. You'll hear comedy, drama, action set pieces, psychological thrillers, original music, slam poetry, improv, magic and mystery that all come together to tell one giant complete story.
A ton of weird original music has been created to help tell the story of Big Data. The weirdest music. A jazz rendition of the text of the first tech hack, as used to accuse a 1903 morse code tycoon of diddling. A confessional J-pop jam that uses Vocaloid voices to hide the identities of anonymous hacktivists. A musical reenactment of spirit poems, written by 1800s conmen to trick widows out of their money. The guitar jams of a spoken word artist hiding in the woods. So much great, weird music that we even put together a soundtrack album.

Even beyond all the amazing original music created for Big Data, we will also be featuring music from all of the biggest names in nerdy music!
That means amazing interlocking tracks from MC Frontalot, Kirby Krackle, Professor Shyguy, The Doubleclicks,Sarah Donner, Alter Ego, Nerds with Guitars, Kari Maaren, Zach Sherwin, Alpha Riff, Adam WarRock, Ask Lovecraft and Tico Souza, Debs & Errol, Jason Anarchy, MC Lars, and Rock, Paper, Cynic.
All the tracks are from Rock, Paper, Cynic's "Broken Telephone Experiment," which was partially inspired by my graphic novel Broken Telephone! Each artist attempted to do a cover of the previous artist's song, after only hearing it once. Over the course of the podcast, you'll hear the songs shift, change and unravel into imaginative new places that mirror the course of the story. You can get those tracks too, as part of the Complete Sequence tier!
Big Data has been a massive endeavor from a team of more than 60 people for well over a year. From Emmy, Grammy and Oscar nominees, to talented people getting their first paychecks as actors. Character actors, studio technicians, child actors, stand up comedians, radio deejays, spoken word artists, musicians, cult icons, an entire Shakespeare troupe and more came together to make this happen.
Cast announcements:
4/25: Our opening narration is by Jemaine Clement, recurring guest stars include Paul F. Tompkins, Cecil Baldwin and Kevin Allison
4/28: Taika Waititi, the Oscar-nominated director of Thor: Ragnarok has a tiny cameo! And our soundtrack has a beat by Menace, producer of #1 Billboard song Designer Panda.
4/29: Amy Stoch who played Missy/Mom in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Bogus Journey is on board to play Marion Spieler!
5/2: Kris Straub, cartoonist/podcaster/creator of Candle Cove, soon to by a SyFy series produced by Max Landis, will be playing cryptocurrency tycoon Blake Rounds.

5/23: Samm Levine (Freaks and Geeks, Inglorious Bastards) joins the crew, along with Lauren Shippen (The Bright Sessions), Paul Kang (The Whatnauts), The cast of Greater Boston, Jerzy Drozd (Galaxy of Super Adventure) and cameos from cast members of the radio dramas Ars Paradoxica, Our Fair City, Friend of the Family, Kakos Industries, and more!
We'll be announcing more of our amazing cast members above as the campaign continues. There are too many amazing people to namedrop them all at once!
Hiring all those talented people costs a lot of money. And so does rent month's worth of studio time for them to perform! No one on the series was working for exposure. I already paid everyone that has been involved so far out of my pocket. After that, and turning down 16 months worth of paying jobs to do this, I have $18 in the bank, 39 hours of audio to edit down into nine, a handful of guest star slots to fill, and a lot of potentially pricey post-production work left to do.
Big Data will have no ads, no corporate sponsorship, no paywall. It will be free to all, even you, even if you don't pledge to this Kickstarter. My only goal is to make back the money I invested, and if we make a little more, to bring on even more amazing people to fill the few remaining guest star roles and make the show even better. I would love for this show to be a big hit, so that my amazing team and I can keep making new radio dramas for years to come. Thank you for helping us go for that goal.
Pasi Sahlberg was Finland's chief inspector of schools … until it was decided teachers did not need Ofsted-style surveillance. Now his job is global spokesman for the Finnish message. Profile by Peter Wilby
Imagine a country where children do nothing but play until they start compulsory schooling at age seven. Then, without exception, they attend comprehensives until the age of 16. Charging school fees is illegal, and so is sorting pupils into ability groups by streaming or setting. There are no inspectors, no exams until the age of 18, no school league tables, no private tuition industry, no school uniforms. Children address teachers by their first names. Even 15-year-olds do no more than 30 minutes' homework a night.
The national curriculum is confined to broad outlines. All teachers take five-year degree courses (there are no fast tracks) and, if they intend to work in primary schools, are thoroughly immersed in educational theory. They teach only four lessons daily, and their professional autonomy is sacrosanct. So attractive (some might say cushy) is a teacher's life that there are 10 applicants for every place on a primary education course, and only 10-15% drop out of a teaching career.
It sounds like Michael Gove's worst nightmare, a country where some combination of teachers' union leaders and trendy academics, "valuing Marxism, revering jargon and fighting excellence" (to use the education secretary's words), have taken over the asylum.
Yet since 2000, this same country, Finland, has consistently featured at or near the top of international league tables for educational performance, whether children are tested on literacy, numeracy or science. More than 60% of its young people enrol in higher education, roughly evenly divided between universities and polytechnics.
Even the management consultancy McKinsey, which has spearheaded the global movement for testing, "accountability" and marketisation, acknowledges that Finland is top. The country's defiance of current political orthodoxies appears to do little economic harm.
According to the World Economic Forum, Finland ranks third in the world for competitiveness thanks to the strength of its schooling, which overcomes the nation's drawbacks, in the forum's view, such as restrictive labour market regulations and high tax rates.
The story, at least for Guardian readers, sounds too good to be true. Is it possible to pick holes in it? I met Pasi Sahlberg, a rather dour (though not, I am told, by Finnish standards) 53-year-old former maths teacher and education academic, during his recent visit to London.
Sahlberg, who now heads an international centre at the education ministry, was Finland's last chief inspector of schools in the early 1990s before politicians decided that teachers could be trusted to do their jobs without Ofsted-style surveillance. "I only ever inspected one school," he says.
Now he has emerged as the global spokesman for Finnish schooling. His book, Finnish Lessons, has been translated into 15 languages, including Chinese, Russian and Arabic, and each day he receives two or three invitations from across the planet to give talks or lectures.
I met him the day after Gove had announced his plans to transform GCSEs, restoring traditional three-hour exams to their former glory. He's never met Gove, but what would he say to him if he did? "I would say: 'I am afraid, Mr Secretary, that the evidence is clear. If you rely on prescription, testing and external control over schools, they are not likely to improve. The GCSE proposals are a step backwards'."
He is similarly dismissive about Gove's enthusiasm for academies and free schools, largely modelled on those in Finland's neighbour, Sweden. "In Sweden," Sahlberg says, "everybody now agrees free schools were a mistake. The quality has not improved and equity has disappeared. If that is what Mr Gove wants, that is what he will get."
Finland hasn't always been an educational superstar. Before the 1970s, fewer than 10% continued their education until the age of 18. The schools were similar to those of England in the 1950s, only worse. After taking tests at the age of 11, children whose results were in the top 25% went mostly to private grammar schools – if their parents could afford the fees. Sahlberg himself, initially educated in a tiny village primary in northern Finland, where both his parents were teachers, was one of the last to go through this system.
By the time he left school in the mid-1970s, the move towards peruskoulu (or comprehensives), had begun, heavily influenced by British thinking. Mixed-ability teaching, teacher education reforms, abolition of the national curriculum (once 700 pages), and devolution of schooling to local authorities followed later.
While England began to dilute its comprehensive system almost as soon as it was established – in the early 1980s, the Tories introduced "parental choice" and offered subsidised places in elite private schools – Finland was further extending its ideal of the common school.
Like England, it had a vociferous lobby demanding a return to selection as well as Swedish-style free schools. Business leaders and rightwing politicians argued that comprehensives held back the gifted and talented and jeopardised the country's economic future.
But the critics were silenced early this century when the first results from the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) emerged. All of a sudden, politicians and educators flocked to Finland in their hundreds, seeking the secret of its success. Finnish education became almost as big a global brand as Nokia. "Pisa stopped the arguments for privatisation and national testing," says Sahlberg. "Many say it saved the Finnish school system."
Sahlberg is reluctant to attribute Finland's economic success to its schools. "Some would say it's the other way round: we have educational success because we have economic success." To him and other Finns, equity is the schools' greatest achievement: the gap between high and low achievers is the smallest in the world and nobody talks of failing schools because there isn't that much difference between schools' results.
Sahlberg insists: "Pisa is not what we are about. League tables are not a good measure of a school system. We never aimed to be the best in education, only to have good schools for all. Equity came before a 'race to the top' mentality." Like many other educational researchers, he argues that most pupil achievement is explained by factors outside of school authorities' control and that, if politicians wish to elevate children out of poverty, they should look to other public policy areas.
Which leaves the question of whether Finnish schooling is exportable. Finland is an unusually homogeneous society: child poverty is low, and the ratio of income share between the richest 20% of the population and the poorest 20% is only a little over four-to-one, against nine-to-one in the UK. Its proportion of foreign-born citizens, moreover, is under 5%, and was much lower a decade ago.
All this, critics argue, makes it easy for Finland to put all children through comprehensives without social or educational strain. Other critics point to the Finnish language which, like Korean (South Korea is also near the top of the Pisa tables), is written almost exactly as it is pronounced. Young Finns and Koreans have little trouble with spelling, which not only makes reading and writing easier, but leaves more time for other subjects.
Sahlberg doesn't wholly dismiss either of these arguments, but suggests that other influences outside the schools are more important. Finnish adults, he says, are the world's most active readers. They take out more library books, own more books and read more newspapers than any other nation.
"Reading is part of our culture. At one time, you couldn't marry unless you could read. If you belonged to the Lutheran state church, you had to go a camp for two weeks before confirmation, as I did. I had to read the Bible and other religious books to the priest and answer questions to show I understood them. Only then could I be confirmed and only if I was confirmed could I get a licence to marry in church. That is still the case. Now, of course, you can get married anywhere, but 50 years ago there were very few options other than marrying in church and, 100 years ago, none at all."
There is another issue. Finnish education isn't quite what it seems. Exams and competitive pressures may have been eradicated from schools, leaving teachers and pupils free for the co-operative pursuit of cultural, creative and moral improvement. But this educational idyll eventually comes to an abrupt end.
Pupils who stay beyond 16, as more than 90% do, move into separate (allegedly self-selected) streams: "general" and "vocational" upper secondary schools. Though there is some crossover between the two, the vocational school students usually go to polytechnics or directly into jobs.
Only the general school – catering for what, in effect, is the academic stream – offers the 155-year-old national matriculation exam, a minimum requirement for university entry. Wholly financed from student fees (in a system in which everything else, including school meals, is completely free until university graduation), the exam comprises traditional essay-based external tests covering at least four subject areas. To study a particular subject at a particular institution, students must take yet more exams set by the universities themselves.
As Sahlberg acknowledges, Finland hasn't abolished competition; it has just moved it to a different part of the system. "It is getting tougher and tougher to reach the end points," he says. "It is the Finnish compromise."
In other words, although Finland unarguably achieves better results for more of its children than almost any other country in the world, success may (and I emphasise "may") be attributable less to its laid-back school regime than to the children's expectations of later competitive pressures. Exporting what appear to be educational success stories is a dubious enterprise, because it is so easy to misread how another country's system works and to discount its cultural background.
Sahlberg, I think, would agree. He is an odd, diffident sort of ambassador, spreading the message about "the Finnish miracle" but not really believing in the data that supposedly proves that it works. His fear now is that Finland's educational success is breeding complacency.
"Ask Finns about how our system will look in 2030, and they will say it will look like it does now. We don't have many ideas about how to renew our system. We need less formal, class-based teaching, more personalised learning, more focus on developing social and team skills. We are not talking about these things at all."
The BrewPi Spark 3 is the next iteration of our brewing temperature controller.
It will keep your beer temperature within 0.1 degrees of the setpoint and send your brewing data to a webserver in your own house via WiFi or USB.
No sensors are included with the controller. We sell many types of sensors and solid state relays separately, so you can adapt your order to what YOUR brewery needs. We like to keep it modular and flexible.
See, that's why we keep it flexible and modular!
Sensor inputs
The BrewPi Spark 3 has 5 RJ12 ports for sensors and expansion boards. The Spark is only compatible with DS18B20 OneWire sensors. It is not compatible with thermocouples and RTDs like a PT-100.
SSR Outputs
The BrewPi Spark 3 has 5 digital outputs for actuators, which it drives with a fully customizable PWM signal. You can set the switching period, minimum ON time, minimum OFF time and a minimum time for switching between heating and cooling. This ensures safe operation for fridge compressors and will prevent short cycling.
Power
You can power the BrewPi Spark via USB or via the 12V input. A power supply is not included, but available from the store.
Powering via the 12V input is only needed if you want to use our motorized ball valve control expansion board.
For this new model, we have 2 actuator outputs, 2 sensor inputs and power inputs all on the bottom, so you can have all your cables exit on the bottom for a neat cable layout. On the top, there are 3 sensor inputs and 3 outputs. Dust caps are included.
Quality
The BrewPi Spark is built with high quality components and it is made in the Netherlands. It has been CE-tested and and every device is functionally tested before it is shipped.
When we initially selected the five Dutch cities we would explore over the course of our #CyclingAbroad adventure, many of our friends had no idea where Groningen was, let alone why we would want to visit there. But among our colleagues in the transportation and urbanism world, a pilgrimage to this once-fortressed college town, 200 km northeast of Utrecht – famously declared “The World's Cycling City” by Streetfilms' short documentary – was an absolute must.

With a population of around 200,000, a quarter of whom are students at the two local universities, Groningen has accomplished a feat many emerging cycling cities could only dream of: a bicycle mode share that eclipses the established powerhouses of Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Recent figures indicate a staggering 61% of trips in the city are made by bicycle. That's almost nine times larger than Vancouver's celebrated mode share. Needless to say, we were incredibly excited, if not a little intimidated; to experience life in 2002's deservedly crowned Cycling City of the Netherlands.
Going against convention wisdom; taking the opposite direction
To understand how Groningen got to where it is today, one must look back nearly 50 years, to a young, idealistic politician who bravely decided to go against conventional wisdom.
In the mid-1970s, as cities across the country were scrambling to create the ideal conditions for mass motoring (including, most notably, Amsterdam), a left-leaning Groningen council recognized the inherent flaws in rebuilding their city around the private automobile. Max Van den Berg, then just 24 years old, and the councillor responsible for traffic and urban development, resolved to take his city in the opposite direction. Under Van den Berg's advice, in 1977, council all but banished motor vehicles from the city centre, making it a far more pleasant place for people on foot and bicycle.
For Lior Steinberg, an urban planner born and raised in Tel Aviv, the resulting lively cityscape is what drew him to relocate to Groningen, after a study tour while completing his master's degree. “Groningen is a vibrant city, and there is a great cultural life. It's a real hidden gem,” he claims. ”In the past two years I've been getting around solely by bike: either to the supermarket on the next block, or moving apartment to the other side of town.”
Making the city centre “practically impenetrable”
Steinberg credits Van den Berg's Traffic Circulation Plan as central to Groningen's successes: “The circulation plan divided the city centre to four parts, forbidding cars to cross between those quarters,” he explains. “This made the city centre practically impenetrable with a car, and made cycling and walking the best way to get around.”
While the plan didn't completely remove motor vehicles from the equation (public buses and delivery vans still access certain parts of the city centre), we pedalled practically everywhere with our children over the course of a week, feeling completely at ease with our surroundings. Bicycles definitely rule the road in Groningen, with thousands of cyclists rolling along virtually every one of its cobblestone streets, from dawn until long after dusk.
“Cycling is in our DNA… We aim to keep it that way”
After being recognized for their achievements in 2002, Groningen enjoyed newfound notoriety both home and abroad. But other Dutch cities began replicating their winning formula, and – having discovered that improving cycling conditions serves as an inexpensive and effective way to remain competitive – quickly started catching up.
At the same time, many of the city's cycle routes were experiencing problematic congestion, particularly on corridors leading to the university campus. The need to deal with an ever-increasing volume of people on bikes, along with the desire to retain their title of “The World's Cycling City”, are what provided the impetus for the Groningen Cycling City strategy.
“Cycling is in our DNA. We are proud of it and definitely aim to keep it that way,” reads the preface of the 48-page plan. This is as clear of a mission statement as it gets.
“Aiming to put the bicycle first again”
Saskia Zwiers, the campaign's coordinator, says the strategy will improve conditions for the many residents who travel by bike: “With the projects and ambitions of the new bicycle strategy, the quality of cycling will improve even more, as we are really aiming to put the bicycle first again in decision-making and planning processes.”
Many the projects contained in this “bicycle first” strategy are rather ambitious and innovative. Most notably, as a northern city, Groningen's temperatures often hover around freezing during winter months, creating frosty conditions unsafe for road users, especially those on the narrow wheels of a bike. Within the next decade, officials hope to use geothermal energy (from the earth) and wastewater thermal energy (from the sewers) to heat the cycle tracks, keeping them clear of frost and snow, and allowing for safe, year-round, two-wheeled travel.
“Solve traffic situations with eye contact”
Other measures include a series of “smart routes“: direct, convenient cycle paths designed to get students and staff to school in 15 minutes, without having to make a single stop.
Groningen is also one of the first cities to attempt to “solve traffic situations with eye contact,” first piloting, then expanding, a counterintuitive, but highly effective four-way green light for cyclists at 29 different intersections.
With as many as 20,000 cyclists travelling certain corridors on a given day, planners are being forced to “think outside the lane,” and experiment with the notion of handing entire streets – known as fietsstraten (Dutch for “bike streets”) – over to the bicycle as the dominant mode of transportation.
Improving the relationship between bikes and transit
The plan also includes a long-overdue expansion of their central train and bus station. Already overflowing from its above and below-ground parking lots – capable of holding 10,000 bikes – the strategy aims to expand that availability by another 5,000 bikes. The City also hopes to improve connectivity from the station to the existing cycling network by building a bicycle tunnel under the bus depot, reducing conflicts between these two popular modes.
As for the city centre, perhaps the most inevitable change will be the removal of buses, planned for implementation in 2018. Currently sharing narrow streets with cyclists that outnumber them exponentially, transport planners have finally acknowledged the supremacy of the bicycle, but the change will mean some adjustments for transit users.
Ultimately, Zwiers believes it will mean a better shopping experience for residents and visitors alike: “I'm very excited about the future of my city. In the next four years, it will be transformed with even better public spaces and sustainable mobility options.”
“The biggest concern shouldn't be cycling, but walkability”
In every Dutch city we toured, moving by bike was simple and intuitive, even for our seven-year-old son. But travelling on foot was much less desirable, and Groningen was no exception. Sidewalks are narrow, and teeming with bikes parked anywhere their owners could find a space. In fact, shops along the busier routes in Groningen now roll out red carpets to their front doors; not to make their patrons feel like royalty, but to discourage the parking of bicycles, and maintain access for their customers.
Steinberg feels addressing people on foot is of utmost importance: “To be frank, the biggest concern at City Hall today shouldn't be cycling, but walkability. Many of the city's sidewalks are not accessible to elderly or physically-challenged people.”
The City is addressing these concerns, albeit incrementally, by designating a number of pedestrian-only streets, with plans to expand them. “Giving all these people and activities a place within a compact city is an ongoing challenge,” Zwiers admits. “At this moment, it's not perfect, but things will definitely improve in the coming years.”
“We don't even think about the luxury we enjoy here”
After spending our final few days in The Netherlands savouring the bustling cycling streets of Groningen, we could easily see why it had gained a positive reputation in urbanism circles. Even the commute from our accommodations – located in a residential community 4 km south of the centre – was completely seamless and separated from traffic; something most suburban streets in North America sadly still lack.
It's the reason people like Steinberg and Zwiers, both relatively recent transplants to Groningen, fell in love with the city, and have no intention of leaving. “I love cycling in Groningen. It's so straightforward to ride a bike here,” suggests Zwiers. “I understand for outsiders it takes some time to adjust to the hectic cycling culture, but I love it. Cycling is so normal, we don't even think about the luxury we enjoy here.”
“Just something people do, without overthinking it”
As we packed our suitcases for the fifth and final time during our journey, one thing was abundantly clear: we would never look at riding a bicycle the same way again. Cycling in cities such as Groningen felt so completely natural, so incredibly normal, rather than the fringe activity it is still seen as on our continent. Taking the bike to work, school, the supermarket, and everywhere in between is just something people do, without overthinking it.
That unremarkable comfort and simplicity is an experience that has been fought for and embraced in practically every city across The Netherlands. We departed deeply grateful for an opportunity to live in cycling utopia, however briefly, determined to return sooner rather than later. Five weeks in this multi-modal paradise helped us realize the cities we hope, dream, and aspire to build for future generations already exist, they're just waiting to be replicated elsewhere. On that front, our work is only getting started.

CASSVILLE – Perhaps it was Jean Wallace's claim of clairvoyance that drove her into the Ozarks' wilderness. She came to hide in a cabin tucked among the trees; one faraway from her East Coast origins. But as plans often do, hers didn't work out.
Because the world found her anyway.
For nearly 50 years, hundreds of locals came to Miss Wallace's door, their lives dictating their journey more than their feet.
“A seer of vision, friend and counselor to hundreds, finder of lost articles, the woman remained a mystery to her neighbors who loved her, and became a legend from the hills she treasured,” wrote Irene Horner in 1978 for the Barry County Advertiser.
To them, she wasn't just Miss Wallace: She was the Maid of Roaring River.
In the beginning
The story of Miss Wallace isn't lost to locals, but time has blurred some of the details. These days, very few people remember Miss Wallace firsthand, and what's been reported about her — even in accounts from decades ago — presents contradictory pictures. Such factors lend an air of mystery to her life, which began in 1851.
Even where it began is up for debate. Horner penned in the same article that Miss Wallace was born “according to her account, on a ‘pier at the foot of Canal Street in New York City.'”
William Preston of Seligman, however, claimed in a 1968 article for the Springfield Daily News that he'd also spoken to Miss Wallace and she “told my wife and me that her family was from Scotland and she was born at sea during their voyage to America.”
Regardless of where she began her life, it's recorded that she discovered her gift — or curse, depending on how one looks at it — as a child. In her younger years, she was frustrated by other people who misplaced items that she could see in her mind's eye.
It was her father who eventually explained to her that she had a special power; that she must be patient with others who didn't have that “sight.” He also admonished her that such things must only be used for good, and never for financial gain. “As far as known, she always obeyed that injunction,” wrote Horner.
Settling in the Ozarks
But even those with second sight must live in the “real” world, and as an adult, Miss Wallace decided to become a nurse. The profession, however, didn't turn out to be a wise choice. “The way I present it is that she couldn't stand the fate of knowing whether her patients would live or die,” says preservationist Tracie Snodgrass, who has spent years portraying Miss Wallace for group events.
Stories abound on what exactly brought Miss Wallace to the Ozarks in the first place. Some reports say she came to southwest Missouri with friends, but that the other ladies eventually moved away.
Snodgrass, however, believes that the story was a little different than that. She thinks that Miss Wallace was bound for Eureka Springs, Ark. with a young man she intended to marry; that the man was seeking medicinal help from the springs, but that he died.
“Then she discovered Roaring River and decided to stay,” says Snodgrass, noting that she believes Miss Wallace chose to hide in the woods, being so upset about her fiancee's death. But really, “it's all storytelling,” Snodgrass says. “(It's) mouth-to-mouth so nobody knows for sure.”
“A tasteful sign, painted in gold letters on a black background, directed visitors down a mile-long wagon road through the woods to her sturdy two-room log house set in a small clearing,” wrote Irene Horner in 1978. (Photo courtesy of Fields' Photo Archives)
Regardless of why, Miss Wallace chose the wilderness near Roaring River State Park to be her home around 1892. It's likely that her move wasn't easy: Her lifestyle wasn't a typical one for women in that day and age — and her attractiveness perhaps propelled her notoriety. “She was always neatly dressed and kept her lovely blond hair combed to the style of that day,” said Preston.
Horner agreed, writing that Miss Wallace's eyes were “the bluest blue that had ever been seen in this part of the Ozarks. She was once a comely blonde, with honey color hair, yet she died an old maid, and she always vowed she knew she would.” After all, according to some accounts, Miss Wallace was said to say, “Who would want a wife who knew everything her husband had every done, thought, or was going to do?”
Such things could feed a gossip mill for a lifetime: Miss Wallace was an unmarried, pretty, young, Easterner who homesteaded a 160-acre claim when it wasn't the norm for females — not to mention that she claimed to see the future.
Although reports note that Miss Wallace was loved and appreciated by the end of her life, Snodgrass says that locals were suspicious of her to begin with — even though she was a deeply rooted Episcopalian, and often used Bible passages to give advice or console her visitors. “Back then, they associated a sixth-sense with witchcraft,” she says.
But time changed things. “They were curious,” says Snodgrass of Miss Wallace's neighbors. “So they'd go up and see her. A lot of time they'd go out of need.”
Those needs might involve locating stray animals, or relationship advice. As time passed, her popularity grew — perhaps because her predictions, which were reportedly often correct, helped the locals. “The road to her cabin door was well worn by worried folks who had lost something or were at their wit's end about some personal problem,” wrote Horner. “She delighted in greeting the stranger with the answer to his problem before he had time to state it — much to his amazement.”
Miss Wallace's cabin, shown here in 1940, also housed her collection of cats: It is difficult to see, but there was a cat “hole” near the door for her furry friends to come and go. (Photo courtesy of Fields' Photo Archives)
The only time she moved away from her cabin was during World War I, when she temporarily resumed nursing as an “acting mother” of a soldiers' cottage in Long Island, N.Y. But “immediately after the signing of the armistice, she returned to her cabin home,” said Horner.
She may have returned to her home, but according to Snodgrass, her cabin wasn't there. Once again, debate surrounds the cabin's demise. According to Preston, it was a forest fire that destroyed it; Snodgrass, however, suspects arson.
But regardless of why, “her many old friends decided to have a house raising for her and they did,” says Preston. “Everyone pitched in, the men working and the women keeping them fed. By night fall, we had a log pen built with a roof on it.”
Looking forward

That new cabin served as Miss Wallace's home for the rest of her life. It's also the spot many members of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) visited while working at Roaring River State Park.
“The boys more or less adopted the strange old woman, taking food and supplies when they went for counsel, and in general seeing that she had what she needed,” wrote Horner, who also noted that “the boys would have fought for Miss Wallace, and probably she for them, so mutual was the affection.”
While many people believed Miss Wallace's predictions, there were naysayers here and there — but she didn't have much patience with such individuals.
One of those doubters was a CCC member, who had lost something but scoffed at the suggestion that “the old fool” could help him find it. Finally, despair drove him to her cabin as a last resort: But Horner reported that he didn't get what he was looking for, and returned quickly, upset and out of breath.
“Oh, gosh!” he gasped. “It was awful. I approached the hut, thinking up a nice speech to please the old girl, and a whole mob of cats came out a hole near the front. “I didn't get a chance to ask her anything. They minute I knocked on the door, she threw it open and snapped at me, ‘This old fool can, but will not tell you anything.' Then she slammed the door in my face.”
As years progressed
Time changes life, and Miss Wallace wasn't an exception to the rule. By the time the late 1930s rolled around, her health and eyesight began to fail. She let her personal appearance go, and carrying water — obtained from 200 yards down a steep path from her cabin — became difficult.
Locals tried to help Miss Wallace, and did to some extent by cutting firewood and bringing food to the cabin. But pride stood in the way of any major assistance, even though “as her health failed, her cabin home was a scene of disorder, filth and squalor,” wrote Horner. Some encouraged her to mortgage her land to provide more financial assistance, but she refused the suggestion.
For much of her life, Miss Wallace also declined being photographed. But in February 1940, she had a sudden change of heart: For the first time in years, she consented to having her picture taken. “Not only was she willing to pose for the many photographs taken by the Fields' Photo shop on that eventful day, but she kept repeating, ‘Take all you want — all you want,' which of course, seemed strange after her long-time aversion for the camera,” recorded Horner.
Miss Wallace staunchly maintained that she was unable to see her own future, but perhaps this was an exception. The week after the photos were taken — on Feb. 26, 1940 — her cabin burned to the ground.
The Macon Chronicle-Hearld picked up the story, noting that “the ‘mystery maid' of Roaring River may have burned to death today.” The article also said that it was two boys who first noticed smoke at the site, and that “there was no trace of the aged woman whose willingness to discuss the troubles of others brought many to her door.”
After some investigation, all that remained of the 88-year-old woman was a handful of bone fragments used to confirm her presence.
Final thoughts
Miss Wallace's cabin has been gone for more than 75 years, but the atmosphere around where it stood remains. Today, the land is part of the Mark Twain National Forest.
What little that remained of Miss Wallace was buried in the Seligman Cemetery, marked by a modest stone that listed her name and dates of birth and death. Her land was sold, and eventually became part of the Mark Twain National Forest.
However, in 2006, the Barry County Genealogical and Historical Society decided that more should be done to recognize this longtime local legend. Representatives from the organization worked with Wommack Memorial Company to design a new stone to mark her grave; it includes her name, dates of birth and death as well as a brief history of the Mountain Maid legend. The new stone was presented to the community in a memorial service for Miss Wallace on Sept. 30, 2006.
More than 65 years after her death, a new stone was installed at Miss Wallace's final resting place. The old stone was moved to the foot of her grave.
It was the hope of the historical society that such action would help visitors understand a little bit more about who Jean Wallace was — a person who influenced history through more than her fortune telling. “I think she was fascinating because she just did that on her own,” says Snodgrass, referencing Miss Wallace's success at homesteading. “I just think it took a lot of courage and bravery. I just admire her.”

The Journalist
Military battles have been fought for centuries. Throughout history, these battles were recorded through written word or verbally past down to friends and family members describing eye-witness accounts of the tragedy of war. Since the 19th century, historical records of battles have been preserved through still photography and eventually cinematography. This short film, The Journalist, is the portrayal of five fictitional journalists and their ability to capture key battles that were fought in the Civil War, World Wars 1 & 2, Vietnam War and modern engagements of the 21st century.
These brave men risked their lives in order to record the battles that our country's soldiers fought to preserve our freedoms. We have chosen this topic from a journalist perspective because battles have not always been depicted in short films from a journalist point of view. The filming of these battles will seamlessly transition from one battle to the next, allowing 1-2 minutes of film for each battle. Our goal is to make this film realistic and raw, without overdoing the use of digital effects.
Why are we asking for $3000? Making any short or long film is very expensive. To enhance the authenticity of our actors, we want to replicate the costumes of all the various war periods. For the larger battle scenes, we will be costuming 12-15 actors. Weapons, uniforms and field gear for the different war periods will be needed for each actor. All special effects will be live on camera and a small percentage of the effects will be digitally enhanced.
In order to provide tangeble on camera effects, we will need numatic explosion simulators, squibs, dust guns and smoke generators. To enhance our camera equipment, we need cinema lenses, camera rigs, and field monitors. We want to make audio a siginificant part of this film and in order to give it a high priority, we need: field recorders, mixers, and professional shot gun mics. Most of our locations are free, but some have a $300 rental fee for use of the property.
The trailer and film clips available for your viewing were made for less than $300. Our goal is to make a short film worthy of entrance to national film festivals. Part of making a great film is having a great story. We believe The Journalist is a great story. We need funding to produce a great film. Please consider being a part of this project. We are offering prizes for any contribution that is given. Thank you for your consideration of support for The Journalist.

The economic slowdown has meant less money to spend A UN report says hunger in South Asia has reached its highest level in 40 years because of food and fuel price rises and the global economic downturn. The report by the UN children's fund, Unicef, says that 100 million more people in the region are going hungry compared with two years ago. It names the worst affected areas as Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan. The report says South Asia's governments need to urgently increase social spending to meet the challenge. It says that climate change and urbanisation also need tackling. Poverty trap According to the World Bank, three quarters of the population in South Asia - almost 1.2 billion people - live on less than $2 (£1.2) a day. And more than 400m people in the region are now chronically hungry. The report focused on the impact the economic crisis had on women and children, saying they are the people most vulnerable during a downturn. "We are on the verge of a crisis," Aniruddha Bonnerjee, a Unicef consultant said. The report cites a number of factors for and symptoms of the sharp rise in people living in hunger and poverty: Declining wages at home A drop in remittances from abroad Poor women often go without food to feed their families Children can be pulled out of school and sent to work High prices have forced people to borrow money at high interest Income is spent on food but not on other essentials 'Worst affected' Millions of South Asian people live on less than $2 a day Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan are the worst affected but even the region's economic giant, India, has suffered because of job losses and lower remittances from Indians living abroad. Unicef says the region's governments need to increase spending on food, health care and education to alleviate the crisis. But it acknowledges that the economic slowdown means there is less money to spend. It said that it was important for the two biggest countries in South Asia, India and Pakistan, to reduce their defence budgets to allow for increased social spending. Governments of the region can also use fiscal stimulus programmes and aid from abroad to expand the provision of basic social services in fields like health and education, it says, while funding training programmes - especially for young people.

As the litigation over the travel ban has developed, the debate over the legality of the policy increasingly hinges on whether the judiciary can permissibly consider off-the-cuff statements made by Trump and his associates as evidence of religious animus in the drafting of the executive orders. So far, the courts have largely found that they can, albeit over strong dissents objecting to the propriety of putting weight on such statements. And with the Department of Justice's petition for a writ of certiorari filed in International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump (IRAP), we may soon find where the Supreme Court stands on the question.
What's particularly interesting about the en banc decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit last week in IRAP is not only the fact that a majority of the judges ruled against the administration in finding the revised travel ban unconstitutional and rooted in religious animus, but the language with which they did so. Notably, both the majority opinion and two of the four concurrences use rhetoric of blindness and sight to describe their reasoning as to why statements by Trump and aides on the “Muslim ban” may permissibly be considered.
In crafting a three-part standard for evaluating whether or not Trump's campaign-trail statements are appropriate to incorporate into the court's analysis of the intent behind the travel ban, the majority writes:
But we decline to impose a bright-line rule against considering campaign statements, because as with any evidence, we must make an individualized determination as to a statement's relevancy and probative value in light of all the circumstances. The campaign statements here are probative of purpose because they are closely related in time, attributable to the primary decisionmaker, and specific and easily connected to the challenged action. … Just as the reasonable observer's “world is not made brand new every morning,” McCreary, 545 U.S. at 866, nor are we able to awake without the vivid memory of these statements. We cannot shut our eyes to such evidence when it stares us in the face, for “there's none so blind as they that won't see.” Jonathan Swift, Polite Conversation 174 (Chiswick Press ed., 1892) [emphasis added].
The majority goes on, “The Government has repeatedly asked this Court to ignore evidence, circumscribe our own review, and blindly defer to executive action, all in the name of the Constitution's separation of powers [emphasis added]. We decline to do so…”
Likewise, Judge James Wynn writes in his concurrence that, “[E]ven when the President invokes national security as a justification for a policy that encroaches on fundamental rights, our courts must not turn a blind eye to statements by the President and his advisors bearing on the policy's purpose and constitutionality.”
And Judge Stephanie Thacker's concurrence states, “Our constitutional system creates a strong presumption of legitimacy for presidential action; however, this deference does not require us to cover our eyes and ears and stand mute simply because a president incants the words ‘national security.'”
All these opinions rely heavily on McCreary County v. ACLU, in which the Supreme Court held that courts may permissibly inquire into context in evaluating legislative purpose under the Establishment Clause, but must refrain from “judicial psychoanalysis.” And McCreary itself uses the language of blindness and sight to describe the courts' inquiry into context: the Court wrote that “reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and our precedents sensibly forbid an observer ‘to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose.'” So perhaps it should not be surprising that the Fourth Circuit also relies on this rhetoric, in Judge Wynn's case to the point of using the same idiom. But it is nevertheless striking that three of the eight IRAP opinions use this rhetoric quite sharply against the Trump administration, not just by quoting McCreary but in the judges' own prose.
This also isn't the first time that judges have ruled against the administration's travel ban using this language to address questions of whether they may permissibly examine Trump's statements as evidence of animus. In a ruling converting a temporary restraining order on two key provisions of the revised travel ban into a preliminary injunction, Judge Derrick Watson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii wrote, “The Court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has.”
So why is everyone using the same metaphor? As Andrew Kent wrote recently on Lawfare: “Just as a Freudian slip is said by psychoanalysts to reveal processes of the unconscious mind, sometimes the verbal tics, mis-citations of precedent, excessive or evasive rhetoric, and other oddities in judicial opinions can give clues to the underlying thoughts and motivations of the judges.”
Benjamin Wittes and I have written extensively on the surprising lack of deference shown by the courts to the revised travel ban—a document that at first seemed designed to clear the hurdles faced by the first executive order, which was both more bombastic and less carefully-lawyered. At the time, we argued that judiciary's unusual willingness to push back against the executive branch at the confluence of two areas in which the President is usually granted great deference—immigration and national security—flowed from a lack of trust in Donald Trump's fidelity to his oath of office. At the time, we speculated:
Perhaps … there's an unexpressed legal principle functionally at work here: That President Trump is a crazy person whose oath of office large numbers of judges simply don't trust and to whom, therefore, a whole lot of normal rules of judicial conduct do not apply…. In this scenario, there are really two presidencies for purposes of judicial review: One is the presidency when judges believe the president's oath—that is, a presidency in which all sorts of norms of deference apply—and the other is a presidency in which judges don't believe the oath. What we may be watching here is the development of a new body of law for this second type of presidency.
We can read the language of blindness and sight as something of a doctrinal means by which judges are signaling their recognition that this is a new type of presidency, for which they are developing a new body of law. By framing the question of whether to incorporate off-the-cuff statements by Trump and aides as a matter of whether or not to be “blind” to the reality before them, the judges are saying that they cannot ignore not only that the President or President-elect made those statements, but that the President is Donald Trump.
To be clear, the question of whether the courts may permissibly consider a pattern of statements made by the President both before and after his election and inauguration, and whether they can permissibly consider the fact that the President in question is Donald Trump, are two different matters. We have recently seen arguments from commentators both supporting and opposing the Fourth Circuit's decision in IRAP that view these issues as entirely distinct. Critiquing the IRAP decision in Lawfare, Josh Blackman has argued that the Fourth Circuit's ruling is entirely an effort “to hold President Trump at bay.” Responding on Take Care, Leah Litman, Helen Murillo, and Steve Vladeck take the position that the question of whether Trump's statements are permissibly the subject of judicial analysis is a purely legal issue, entirely distinct from any discomfort judges may have with the fact of Trump's presidency. In Blackman's view, the IRAP decision is entirely about Trump qua Trump, and is therefore illegitimate as a work of legal reasoning; in Litman, Murillo, and Vladeck's view, the decision is based on a neutral principle separate from the fact that Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and is therefore legitimate.
I think the truth is more complicated. The two matters of the specific presidency of Donald Trump and of the courts' surprising willingness to consider Trump's statements are linked: the courts have been unusually willing to interpret the law in the manner least deferential to the executive because that executive is Donald Trump—and because they doubt Trump's oath. It's an interesting chicken-and-egg question whether the pattern of statements by Trump and his aides has undermined judicial confidence in Trump's oath, or whether preexisting doubts about the oath shaped the judiciary's response to Trump's statements.
Dissenting in IRAP, Judge Paul Niemeyer complains that “the plaintiffs conceded during oral argument that if another candidate had won the presidential election in November 2016 and thereafter entered this same Executive Order, they would have had no problem with the Order.” In many ways, that's the point: to Judge Niemeyer (and Judge Dennis Shedd and Judge Steven Agee, who joined in Niemeyer's dissent), Trump is the president and should be treated as the judiciary would treat any other president. But to the majority, Trump is not the president in the sense that we would usually recognize—and he should not be treated as such.
For this reason, it's notable that none of the three IRAP dissents makes use of the majority's rhetoric of blindness: they don't accept the majority's implicit framing of the Trump presidency as wielding a second, different kind of executive authority. It's also notable that the majority so carefully emphasizes that its decision does not represent a wholesale reworking of jurisprudence, but rather responds to the specific facts before the court. That is, the majority is crafting a new jurisprudence for a new kind of presidency, rather than overthrowing the old jurisprudence as the dissents accuse it of doing: “If and when future courts are confronted with campaign or other statements proffered as evidence of governmental purpose, those courts must similarly determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether such statements are probative evidence of governmental purpose. Our holding today neither limits nor expands their review (emphasis added).”
And later: “The deference we give the coordinate branches is surely powerful, but even it must yield in certain circumstances, lest we abdicate our own duties to uphold the Constitution” (emphasis added).
Specifically, the majority derives this exceptional jurisprudence for an oathless presidency, at least in this context, from the “facially legitimate and bona fide” test for a First Amendment claim against government restrictions on immigration established by Kleindiest v. Mandel. Under Justice Kennedy's controlling concurrence in Kerry v. Din, the majority argues, the courts may permissibly assess the legitimacy of a government action under the “facially legitimate and bona fide” standard if the plaintiff has made an “affirmative showing of bad faith” that is “plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity.” The court thus reads Mandel and Din as allowing the judiciary to “step away from our deferential posture and look behind the stated reason for the challenged action” in an instance in which “plaintiffs have seriously called into question whether the stated reason for the challenged action was provided in good faith.”
And examining Trump's campaign-trail and presidential statements on the travel ban—an examination the majority considers permissible under McCreary—the court finds the national security rationale behind the travel ban to have been proffered in bad faith. (In her concurrence, Judge Stephanie Thacker reaches the same conclusion only on the basis of post-inauguration statements by Trump, having reasoned that candidate Trump's comments are not appropriately considered.)
There are certainly disagreements to be had with this analysis. (Judge Niemeyer, for example, argues that it substantially misapplies both Mandel and Din. On Lawfare, Peter Margulies and Josh Blackman have made similar points.) But if the courts are going to write a new jurisprudence for an oathless presidency into the law, Mandel and Din actually make for a very natural place to start. Both literally concern the question of “bad faith,” the same question raised by whether the courts can trust Trump's fidelity to his oath. To put it another way, the cases are an expression of the “presumption of regularity,” the idea that we can usually trust public officials to do their duty. And as the Trump administration is discovering, that presumption of regularity is only a presumption, which courts can waive in extraordinary circumstances.
If the majority—along with the number of other courts that have ruled against both the original and the revised travel ban—is crafting a new body of law for a new kind of presidency outside the presumption of regularity, why not say so explicitly? I suspect that many onlookers sympathetic to the plaintiffs but concerned by the charge into uncharted legal territory might be comforted by a direct acknowledgement of the dynamics at work here, but the rhetorical signposts of blindness and sight may be as close as the courts can comfortably get. It may be a question of wanting to step lightly or to avoid further accusations of making up law from whole cloth. Or perhaps some of the judges ruling against the ban are seeing through a glass darkly, and may not themselves be entirely aware of the implications.
Courts regularly rely on legal fictions and simplifications, which are what make it possible to map the reasoned structure of law onto a chaotic and unreasonable world. There is nothing wrong or unusual about this. The difference here is that the bizarre facts of the travel ban cases and the bad faith at the core of Trump's presidency have exacerbated—to the point of absurdity—the gap between the abstract legal questions at play under existing doctrine and the facts at the ground. The situation recalls Thomas Kuhn's description of scientific crisis, in which an existing paradigm of thought begins to lose its ability to explain and predict the shape of things. We may be at that point now—where the paradigm of deference to the executive in national security without reference to the integrity of the president's oath is clearly faltering but the jurisprudence of an oathless presidency has yet to fully emerge.
There have been a lot of “firsts” in the 2016 presidential campaign.
But we need to be sure we don't have one more – the election of a president whose own staff recognizes that she hates America and Americans.
It's astonishing, really, that we are the brink of that strong possibility, according to the polls.
I've known Hillary Clinton hates America and average Americans for a long, long time – longer than I care to remember, quite frankly. I've been involved in covering her and her nefarious husband since the early 1990s.
I won't bore you with the long-forgotten details of that era, except to say that the Clinton White House maintained files on its “enemies,” kept an actual “enemies list” in partnership with the Democratic National Committee, spread poison about its “enemies,” like me, to the press, made successful “suggestions” for political audits of its “enemies” to the IRS and instigated massive black ops efforts against those “enemies.”
Most Americans are unaware of these facts because, even then, the so-called (and misnamed) “mainstream media” covered them up as they are still covering them up. (By the way, when this era began, I was part of the so-called “mainstream media” and had been for the previous 20 years.)
But I digress.
I've known Hillary Clinton hates America and Americans because of her actions, because of her rhetoric, because of her radical history and because I know the “type” – having been a part of the hateful left-wing radical cesspool that fostered her hate.
However, thanks to the 2016 presidential campaign and WikiLeaks emails, we now know that even Hillary Clinton's top aides agree that Hillary hates America and Americans – especially “average Americans.”
That deliciously and brutally honest email came from John Podesta, her campaign manager, in a moment of candor to another member of her campaign team. It said: “I know she has begun to hate everyday Americans.”
That is an incredible indictment and one that needs to be in the ears of every everyday American as he or she makes his or her way to the polls Nov. 8.
It's so important.
Think of it.
Who in their right mind would vote for a president who hates everyday Americans?
What other qualification could possibly overcome such contempt for those she is supposed to serve?
Experience more of Joseph Farah's no-nonsense truth-telling in his books, audio and video products, featured in the WND Superstore
That's clearly not the kind of “first” we can afford in 2016 – electing a president who hates not just Republicans, not just conservatives, not just independents, not just Democrats who don't vote for her, not just Bernie Sanders supporters, but plain, old “everyday Americans,” according to no less an authority than her own campaign manager – with tacit confirmation from her other staff, who understood exactly what he meant.
Back in the 1990s, I knew the stories of those who witnessed her behavior are legion. She had a sense of entitlement from the start. She was contemptuous of even those who served her – Secret Service agents, Marine guards, her own employees, her own husband. She was a foul-mouthed, arrogant wretch whose abusive language would make Donald Trump blush.
Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump's call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton!
I know I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
I think most Americans perceive there's something very wrong with Hillary Clinton's character. It's part of the reason that even many of those voting for her simply don't like her.
But my goal here is to bring this home to everyone even tempted to vote for her or tempted not to vote against her: Her closest and most trusted staff know the truth and have stated it plainly in writing. She doesn't like you. She doesn't like me. She doesn't like everyday Americans. In fact, she “hates” them.
Isn't that an extraordinary and revealing admission that absolutely disqualifies her, rules her out and precludes her from serving the people of America?
Doesn't it make her ineligible for consideration?
Doesn't it make you furious that she is even still in this race?
If so, don't even think about sitting on the sidelines this election and subjecting America to this diabolical monster.

Governments and central banks risk tipping the world into a fresh financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund has warned, as it called time on a corporate debt binge in the developing world.
Emerging market companies have "over-borrowed" by $3 trillion in the last decade, reflecting a quadrupling of private sector debt between 2004 and 2014, found the IMF's Global Financial Stability Report.
This dangerous over-leveraging now threatens to unleash a wave of defaults that will imperil an already weak global economy, said stark findings from the IMF's twice yearly report.
The Fund warned there was no margin for error for policymakers navigating these hazardous risks.
The slightest miscalculation, they said, could collapse into a "failed normalisation" of interest rates and market conditions, wiping 3pc from the world's economic output over the next two years.
But indebted corporate balance sheets were just one element of a poisonous "triad" of challenges facing the financial system.
Seven years after the financial crisis, a combination of lingering debt burdens in advanced economies, and vanishing market liquidity could result in a new credit crunch when conditions tighten.
• Five charts that explain a miserable global economy right now
"Policy missteps and adverse shocks could result in prolonged global market turmoil that would ultimately stall the economic recovery," said Jose Viñals, financial counsellor at the IMF.
The world's major central banks should ensure policy remains "accommodative" for fear of setting off a new wave of instability that would see bond prices rise and asset prices collapse, said the IMF.
"Risk premia could decompress in a disorderly way causing a vicious cycle of firesales, redemptions, and more volatility," said Mr Viñals.
The report called on the Federal Reserve to hold off on its first interest rate hike in nine years and for the authorities in the eurozone and Japan to continue with unprecedented stimulus measures.
"Managing any outbreaks in financial contagion will require nimble and judicious use of available policy buffers," added the report.
The IMF painted a picture of a brittle financial system that was coming to the end of a period of cheap liquidity propped up by low rates.
These benign conditions are set to evaporate as the credit cycle tightens in emerging markets.
The summer's stock market volatility and record capital flows from emerging markets hint at the disruption that awaits, said the report.
"Some markets show clear signs that liquidity conditions have worsened and that accommodative monetary policy is masking underlying risks," the report said.
"The challenge will be for abnormal market conditions to adjust smoothly to the new environment."
China's authorities will also have to put up with corporate bankruptcies and debt defaults, said the IMF.
In the wake of its stock market collapse earlier this year, the report called on Beijing to embark on an "orderly deleveraging" by removing stabilisers artificially propping up its indebted companies.
"Moving decisively will ultimately prove less costly than trying to grow out of the problem."
Although governments in the developing world had taken the right policy actions to strengthen their public finances and reduce external debt, leveraged banks and companies could now drive them into the ground, said the report.
Sovereigns could then lose their investment grade status from ratings agencies, heaping more pressure on spiralling borrowing costs.
Last month, Latin America's biggest economy, Brazil, was "junked" by Standard & Poor's rating's agency.
This cocktail of financial risks is compounded by an environment of anaemic growth. The IMF forecasts global output will fall to its lowest level in five years at just 3.1pc this year.
"Low nominal growth would put pressure on debt-laden sovereign and private balance sheets, raising credit risks," said the report.
Accommodative monetary policy is masking underlying risks
"Corporate default rates would rise, particularly in China, raising financial system strains, with implications for growth.
In a bid to manage the transition, the IMF urged authorities to play closer attention to the asset management industry and beef up capital requirements for emerging market banks.
In Europe, EMU authorities should press ahead with their plans for a banking union to plug the architectural gaps that have undermined the future of the single currency.
"What we want to achieve is a successful normalization of financial conditions and monetary policies together with a sustained economic recovery", said Mr Viñals.
"Three percent of global output is at stake".
Researchers have found a way to make cells resistant to HIV, a new report reveals.
In a major breakthrough, scientists have tethered HIV-fighting antibodies to immune cells, creating a cell population resistant to the virus.
These resistant cells can quickly replace diseased cells, making it more effective than other therapies - and potentially curing the deadly disease.
The researchers plan to collaborate with investigators at City of Hope's Center for Gene Therapy, in California, to evaluate this new therapy in efficacy and safety tests, as required by federal regulations, prior to testing in patients.
Scroll down for video
Scientists have found a way to make cells resistant to HIV by attaching antibodies to cell receptors, which block the virus from infecting them. Diseased cells die off and the protected cells spread the protective gene to new cells, making a resistant population
The research, conducted at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) in San Diego, California, first tested their system against rhinovirus, which is responsible for many cases of the common cold.
They used a vector called lentivirus to deliver a new gene to cultured human cells.
The team then had cells synthesize antibodies that bind with the human cell receptor that rhinovirus needs to gain access.
With the antibodies monopolizing that site, the virus cannot enter the cell to spread infection.
HIV TRANSMISSION AND PREVENTION You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities, most commonly through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. The FDA has approved more than two dozen antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV infection. They're often broken into six groups because they work in different ways. Doctors recommend taking a combination or 'cocktail' of at least two of them. Called antiretroviral therapy, or ART, it can't cure HIV, but the medications can extend lifespans and reduce the risk of transmission. 1) Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) NRTIs force the virus to use faulty versions of building blocks so infected cells can't make more HIV. 2) Non-nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) NNRTIs bind to a specific protein so the virus can't make copies of itself. 3) Protease Inhibitors (PIs) These drugs block a protein that infected cells need to put together new copies of the virus. 4) Fusion Inhibitors These drugs help block HIV from getting inside healthy cells in the first place. 5) CCR5 Antagonist This stops HIV before it gets inside a healthy cell, but in a different way than fusion inhibitors. It blocks a specific kind of 'hook' on the outside of certain cells so the virus can't plug in. 5) Integrase Inhibitors These stop HIV from making copies of itself by blocking a key protein that allows the virus to put its DNA into the healthy cell's DNA.
Cells without antibody protection died off, leaving protected cells to survive and multiply, passing on the protective gene to new cells.
In the technique tested against HIV, all strains of the virus need to bind with a cell surface receptor called CD4.
After introducing cells to the virus, the researchers ended up with an HIV-resistant population. The antibodies recognized the CD4 binding site, blocking HIV from getting to the receptor.
'This is really a form of cellular vaccination,' said senior author Dr Richard Lerner, Professor of Immunochemistry at TSRI.
Researchers say the new technique offers a significant advantage over therapies where antibodies float freely in the bloodstream at a relatively low concentration.
Dr Jia Xie, a senior staff scientist at TSRI and first author of the study, called it the 'neighbor effect'. An antibody stuck nearby is more effective than having many antibodies floating throughout the bloodstream.
The scientists further confirmed that these tethered antibodies blocked HIV more effectively than free-floating, soluble antibodies in experiments led by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.
The ultimate goal will be to control HIV in patients with AIDS without the need for other medications.
Although the annual number of new HIV diagnoses declined by 19 percent from 2005 to 2014, the disease is still prevalent.
More than 1.2 million people in the US are living with the virus, and one in eight of them don't know it.
'HIV is treatable but not curable - this remains a disease that causes a lot of suffering. That makes the case for why these technologies are so important,' said Dr Joseph Alvarnas, from City of Hope.
In addition to the collaboration, Dr Xie said the next step in this research will be to try engineering antibodies to protect a different receptor on the cell surface.
Dr Carl Dieffenbach, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told Daily Mail Online that while the design of the idea is interesting, there is a fundamental problem when it comes to gene therapy.
'How do you know how to put antibodies into the right cells?' he explained.
'HIV is notorious for generating large variations and what will happen is that some population of the virus will not bind to the antibody so you'll kill off sensitive cells but the virus will continue to grow.
'With antiretroviral drugs, we have to use a three drug cocktail because of the virus's many variations so you would have to use a similar cocktail of antibodies.'
Dr Dieffenbach added that while there have been several tantalizing research breakthroughs in the last five years, the new findings have yet to be proven in clinical trials.
'We have amazing therapy and really effective therapies, very good tools. But we're not at the point yet where we can make better tools, like a cure or a vaccine,' he said.
For the poor, there is no crueller god than Santa Claus. He drags poor parents into debt, leaves poor children disappointed, and leaves both feeling exposed. In the 1930s Austria, the expectation and experience of Christmas was warped by hardship. In the village of Marienthal, where a local mill's closure destroyed all prosperity, sociologists asked children for Christmas wishlists, and found that these totted up to only 12 shillings, compared with 36 shillings in neighbouring towns. But even though young dreams were tailored to fit with penurious adult realities, they were dashed on the day. Christmas, the researchers concluded, came to mean “disappointment instead of joy and surprise”.
Carols, cuddles and carefree play will all, of course, do their bit to put smiles on young faces on Friday. But nobody with young children is blind to a seriously materialistic dimension, which has deepened and sprawled in unlovely ways since prewar Marienthal. Up and down Britain, sacrifices are being made, payday loans taken out, and irreligious prayers uttered – prayers that little Jonny or Nell won't spot the difference between the official Disney product they asked for and the pirated pound-shop equivalent with which they will have to make do. The cooking and the hosting of cranky uncles can be a challenge in any circumstances, but is doubly stressful where the food budgeting is fraught. Some families will be left shivering in January, after cash which should have been there for the gas meter went on trying to give the children the Christmas they craved. Being cold is an absolute hardship, but when kids compare notes on their presents, relative poverty will be keenly felt too. Christmas, in sum, is a time to make stark the many complex connections between money and all those things, like a contented childhood and a happy home life, that it isn't supposed to be able to buy.
All of which makes this a fitting time of year, too, to reflect on a government drive to refine the way child poverty is measured – or, more precisely, to cloud all efforts at measurement in confusion. Nearly a decade has passed since David Cameron tasked his policy chief, Oliver Letwin, with embracing Labour's ambition to end child poverty in the pages of this newspaper. It was an audacious moment of modernisation, drawing a line under the sometimes Dickensian attitude of the Thatcherites. It was followed by further encouraging signs. Mr Cameron's troops were sent through the lobbies to support Gordon Brown's child poverty bill, which set explicit targets on hard material measures. The coalition's very first budget found £2bn for a tax credit hike to protect poor children from the wider retrenchment.
It all seems a long time ago now. Within weeks of the Conservatives' outright win in May, and with rising poverty rates widely forecast, Iain Duncan Smith set out deeply and perhaps deliberately confused thoughts on redefining the problem and amending the Child Poverty Act. Kitty Stewart and Nick Roberts of the LSE have produced a devastating analysis of the shortcomings of his proposals, which move from a framework of targets, strategy and local authority duties to a world of no targets, no strategy and no duties for councils. In a mire of conceptual confusion, the experience of poverty is blurred into potential causes like addiction. Worklessness is talked up, and material want talked down, even though two poor children in three nowadays live in working homes. The academics describe the contemptuous misrepresentation of the expert advice that the coalition previously received. Trawling through consultation responses, they reveal an overwhelming preference for retaining the focus on income, and scant support for switching to important but tangential matters such as exam results.
The contrast with Gordon Brown is damning. When he said he wanted to abolish poverty, he meant it. The Tory intent is redefining it out of existence – and leaving the ghost of Christmas future to do its worst.
Image copyright EPA Image caption The new agreement seeks to stop the repeated violations of a ceasefire agreed on 5 September
Ukraine's government and pro-Russia rebels have agreed a memorandum on a peace plan for the eastern conflict.
The nine-point deal includes setting up a 30km (19-mile) buffer zone, a ban on overflights of part of eastern Ukraine by military aircraft and the withdrawal of "foreign mercenaries" on both sides.
The agreement was announced at talks in the Belarusian capital Minsk, where a ceasefire was agreed on 5 September.
More than 3,000 have died in fighting in two eastern regions since April.
The original ceasefire has been frequently violated but is still holding.
Ukraine accuses Russia of arming separatists and sending Russian troops to the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The Kremlin denies it has any role there.
In a separate development on Saturday, three powerful blasts rocked the main rebel-held city of Donetsk, with eyewitnesses saying that a chemical plant may have been hit.
Meanwhile, a humanitarian convoy of about 200 lorries from Russia arrived in the city.

Russia says the convoy - Russia's third in recent weeks - delivered food, water and generators, but this was done without Ukraine's authorisation.
'Mercenaries'
The deal was reached after late-night talks between representatives of Ukraine, Russia, eastern separatists and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

Correspondents say it is an effort to add substance to the fragile ceasefire agreement.
Former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, representing Kiev at the talks, said that all sides had agreed to move back some of their heavy weapons.
"Heavy artillery will be moved 15km away from the front line" he said.
He added that the deal would be implemented within 24 hours and monitors from the OSCE would travel to the buffer zone to check for compliance.
Minsk memorandum: Key points
To pull heavy weaponry 15km by each side from the line of contact, creating a 30km security zone
To ban offensive operations
To ban flights by combat aircraft over the security zone
To set up an OSCE monitoring mission
To withdraw all foreign mercenaries from the conflict zone
Separatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said that the two sides did not discuss the status of the rebel-held areas of Luhansk and Donetsk.
"We have our opinion on it while Ukraine has its own," he said.
Earlier this week, Ukraine's parliament passed a bill granting a three-year "self-rule" to parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - a move described as "capitulation" by some Ukrainian lawmakers.
The Russian ambassador to Ukraine, Mikhail Zurabov, representing Moscow at the talks, said that "mercenaries" were fighting on both sides, and called on OSCE to oversee their removal.
Russia has repeatedly said that any of its citizens fighting alongside separatists in Ukraine are doing so in a private capacity.
But Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of actively sending troops and heavy weapons into Ukraine.
There are now fears in Ukraine that Russia wants to create a frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine, the BBC's David Stern in Kiev reports.
Plenty of Windows Phone users had been waiting on the announcement of Windows Phone 8.1 at BUILD 2014, and finally got their wish today as Microsoft reeled off an extensive list of new features soon headed to current Windows Phone 8 devices in the form of a gleaming new update. As well as the likes of Action Center and significant improvements to the lock screen and home screen, one of the key new features of Windows Phone 8.1 is Cortana, the voice assistant that will serve as the software giant's very own take on Siri, and given the cult status of Apple's digital slave, Microsoft seized upon the opportunity to release a series of clips explaining why Cortana will be better.
When Apple first rolled out Siri alongside iOS 5 and the iPhone 4s, the world was fascinated by its ability to process information, perform searches, and generally present itself as a rounded character. But while, with Siri, one would struggle to hold a genuine conversation before the tell-tale awkward silences emerged, one should be able to consider Cortana a virtual friend from the get-go, since, like a real-life buddy, it will begin to learn more about your character over time.
In the weeks leading up to today's announcement, we heard that Microsoft was plotting to deliver a service that embodied the best of both Siri and Google Now, and I guess, when you leave it so long before coming up with your own version of something, the only real advantage is that you can learn from the mistakes of others while implementing the good bits.
What we've seen so far has been rather promising, but while the videos below do a lot of explaining as to why Cortana has the edge over Siri, what we'd really love to have seen was a head-to-head, pound-for pound comparison of each, with a little Google Now thrown in for good measure.
As aforementioned, Windows Phone 8.1 will arrive in the coming months. It should be immediately available to all of those currently running (or able to run) Windows Phone 8, and Nokia's Stephen Elop has already confirmed that all Windows Phone 8 Lumia devices will be supported.
In the meantime, check out these short-but-sweet videos related to Cortana and Siri, and hopefully, we'll get a better insight into Cortana's true capabilities in due course.

Poland has suspended deliveries of gas to Eastern neighbour Ukraine following a “warning signal” reduction of gas deliveries into Europe from Russia, cutting supplies by up to 45 percent over the past couple of days.
The squeeze on gas, on which Europe depends for electricity and heating, has come against the backdrop of German Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for tough new sanctions against Russia for its perceived role in the Ukraine crisis, reports The Times. Poland reported reductions by 20 percent on Monday, and then another 24 percent on Tuesday. Slovakia had its deliveries reduced by 10 percent, and Germany has also seen an unspecified reduction.
Concerns over European reserves of gas, which will be absolutely crucial in the coming winter months means Poland have been forced to keep the little gas they are now receiving from Russia instead of sending surplus to Ukraine.
Russian energy giant Gazprom stopped the supply of gas to Ukraine after they stopped paying their bills in April this year, at which point they owed Russia $4.5 billion for gas received. This prompted EU nations Germany, Poland and Slovakia to enhance ‘return flows' in the gas network. This change in piping infrastructure allowed the redirection of their own deliveries of Russian gas back to Ukraine, who before the war got over half its gas from the Russians.
Gazprom warned back in June that attempting to circumvent Russia's gas embargo to Ukraine would result in supplies to European countries also being cut and three months later, that threat seems to have been realised. After three days of gas cuts, Gazprom still denies there has been any reduction in deliveries.
While Europe, led by an increasingly forthright German Chancellor, pushes for ever harder sanctions against Russia, Poland appears to be learning what it means to ‘bite the hand that feeds'. Almost a quarter of all Europe's energy comes from natural gas, and Russia is a crucial supplier to the European market which during the winter season is susceptible to shock.
A June report by the Council of the European Union on Energy Security revealed that if Russia withheld gas during “peak demand in January… almost the entire EU” except for Spain and Portugal would suffer severe energy shortages. In south-eastern nations like Romania and Bulgaria, only 20-40 percent of normal energy levels could be sustained, meaning prolonged power and heating cuts in countries where winter temperatures can reach minus 30 degrees centigrade.
The report also admits that due to the EU Large Combustion Plants Directive, despite being “highly competitive”, significant coal-fired capacities had to be taken offline in the last two years, rendering Europe's most plentiful and cheapest energy source unable to make up the gas shortfall.
IMAX Corporation is a Canadian theatre company which designs and manufactures IMAX cameras and projection systems as well as performing film development, production, post production and distribution to IMAX affiliated theatres worldwide.[3] Founded in 1968, it has headquarters in the Toronto area, and operations in New York City and Los Angeles.
As of September 2017, there were 1,302 IMAX theatres located in 75 countries, of which 1,203 were in commercial multiplexes.[4] These include IMAX variations such as IMAX 3D, IMAX Dome, and Digital IMAX. The CEO is Richard Gelfond.[5]
History [ edit ]
IMAX is a Canadian corporation that is based in Mississauga, Ontario. The company was founded in 1967 when three filmmakers, Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor and Robert Kerr incorporated IMAX Corporation. The idea and the new technology, which resulted in the birth of the company, came from the work that Ferguson, Kroitor and Kerr had done producing the multi-screen National Film Board of Canada production In the Labyrinth and Ferguson's Man and the Polar Regions for Expo 67.[6][7] From their experience, Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor and Robert Kerr realized that new technology would be necessary to develop a larger and more complex project than previously seen. As a result, they sought an engineer named William Shaw in 1968[8] (he had gone to Galt Collegiate Institute in Galt, Ontario, now Cambridge, with Ferguson and Kerr) to help develop this technology. Shaw created this new projector that allowed for films to have exceptionable quality and to be ten times larger than conventional 35mm picture frames.[9] The first movie IMAX Corporation produced using this new technology was Tiger Child which was featured at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan.[9] It was because of the multi-screen viewing that Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor and Robert Kerr wanted to create a theatre with giant screens, surround sound and stadium seating.
William Shaw was instrumental in helping IMAX Corporation fulfill its ambitions in creating larger and more realistic experiences for audience which included oversized screens, surround sound and steep seating for better viewing.[7] Shaw remained at IMAX (although officially retired) as a designer and inventor until his passing on August 31, 2002 at the age of 73.[9] Before retiring Shaw created a 3D camera which was sent to the International Space Station for IMAX films.[9] In 1994, investment bankers Gelfond and Bradley Wechsler, acquired IMAX Corporation through a leveraged buyout and publicly listed the company on the NASDAQ stock exchange.[10][11] IMAX then began to focus their abilities on attracting Hollywood production houses.[12] Another engineer at IMAX Corporation Brian Bonnick, Chief Technology Officer at IMAX Corporation, developed technologies that made it possible for the worldwide IMAX to produce major Hollywood films.[13] More flexible technology required by that industry led to the development of the IMAX DMR (Digital Re-Mastering), which was able to adapt quickly in various locations. Newer technology followed, including the IMAX Experience and the IMAX MPX theatre system. Revamped IMAX 2D footage has been transferred into IMAX 3D.[13]

In November 2016, Marvel Television and IMAX announced the live action television series, Marvel's Inhumans, based on the superhero race of the same name. The series, co-produced with ABC Studios, saw IMAX serve as a financing partner, a first for IMAX, which allowed Marvel to spend more on the series than it had on its other television series, especially for visual effects. The entire series was filmed with IMAX digital cameras. Inhumans debuted an edited specific for theatrical-release version of the first two episodes. The episodes debuted on IMAX screens in theaters worldwide in September 2017, with the series airing weekly on ABC afterwards.[23][24][25] After the poor reception to the IMAX version of the first two episodes and a box office gross of $3.5 million, Richard Gelfond said, "Going forward, we intend to take a more conservative approach consistent with the Game of Thrones approach to capital investments and content. We will be more conservative when considering whether to invest our own capital; and if so, to what extent."[26]

Last weekend at Eugene Comic Con 2017, Twin Peaks cast members Harry Goaz, Kimmy Robertson, Sherilyn Fenn and James Marshall gathered in Eugene, Oregon, to meet with fans and take questions on stage. Thanks to Brittyn, both the panel and the audience Q&A are now available on YouTube.
We learn that none of them have read any of Mark Frost's books, but “we love Mark too!” Harry Goaz recalls meeting David Lynch for the first time and confirms it's the actor's own Rolex we see when Andy is waiting for the truck owner. Kimmy Robertson recaps the night they shot the Wally Brando scene with a very nervous Michael Cera, and describes how she got Lucy Moran to read a book on Tibet after the rock throwing scene. James Marshall talks about a deleted scene from the original series with his character's mom, without going into too much detail just in case David Lynch would want to use it in a possible fourth season.
“The fans brought the show back. That's not a fantasy. That is real. And David Lynch directed it because of the fans. That was absolutely one hundred percent the whole reason.” —Kimmy Robertson
Sherilyn Fenn confesses she got David Lynch to rewrite her part for the new series. “I was having issues with certain things. Some of us were shown pages and I didn't really understand what was happening, and so I got into trouble about it and we got into a fight. And then it was rewritten… and it was a-ma-zing! I was just being honest… and then he wrote it really good.”
The actress goes on to share her personal take on what's happening to Audrey Horne. “I mean, it was hell, right? It wasn't Audrey you know, but it was certainly 25 years later; some of the chaos and stuff that you're going too. And you're getting older and the prison's in your mind, and “Who am I?” and “What are the choices that I've made?” I think it was real. And maybe revisiting some time when you thought that you were free… but you're still dancing there in a prison. And we all have a prison.”
Sherilyn does add a piece of advice for those who are seeking answers after the new series. “A lot of people have questions about what things mean,” she says. “And I just want you to know, it means what you feel it means. [David Lynch] really wants to take you onto a journey into you.”

Self-Made Man: My Year Disguised as a Man
by Norah Vincent
Atlantic £9.99, pp304
Not many women could get away with successfully impersonating a man over a long period, but then, not many men have the balls Norah Vincent has. The Los Angeles Times columnist spent a year and a half as her male alter ego, Ned, and inveigled herself into all sorts of largely inadvisable situations. Ned joins a bowling league, spends time in a monastery, hangs out in lap-dancing clubs, dates as many women as possible and attempts to discover his inner Neanderthal on a male-bonding camping weekend, where, at one point, he believes he will be found out, stripped of his all-flattening sports bra and beaten to a pulp.
For the first half of the book, you wonder how Vincent pulled it off. I repeatedly broke away from the narrative to stare at the cover image of Norah as a (rather beautiful) woman next to Ned, an equally attractive (and plausible) man.
Ned chose his clothes carefully, worked out to build muscle tone, meticulously glued stubble to his face and took voice coaching. He learned quickly from his mistakes, such as the time at the bowling alley when he found himself 'swaggering just a little too wide and looking like I had a load in my pants'.
For the entire 18 months, Ned went unchallenged, living and working in several US states. In fact, Ned is so successful that when Norah reveals herself, in the late stages of some of her experiments, many of Ned's new friends and colleagues refuse to believe that he is a woman: 'Hey, great joke, buddy!' When the penny finally drops, only a few admit they were worried that Ned was, well, a bit gay.
This is an addictive, enthralling read: each chapter is progressively more fascinating as Ned becomes more ensconced in his new life. He tries to identify with his new bowling friends' all-encompassing sexual urges, but can only fake it. There is much discussion of how married men can get away with visiting girlie bars without their wives realising and how 'no vacation would be quite as relaxing without a little skin in it'.
Even when you take sex out of a man's world, it's a mess, Ned concludes. At the monastery, the inmates are imprisoned, rather than liberated, by a single-gender environment. The place is 'steeped in commonplace masculine angst'. The fear that Ned is gay is at its height here, so everyone gives him a wide berth.
The dating adventures are the most breathtaking. Ned is on the receiving end of women's boring, self-pitying monologues and endless tirades about what bastards men are. His dates all suspect he is as bad as the rest of them: 'They made every man they met into a wolf, even when that man was a woman.'
The dates are when the deceit hits Norah. Her project to experience life as a man turns into a personal nightmare. A feminist and a lesbian, Vincent expects that, as a convincing Ned, she will finally have a life of privilege and entitlement. But men have their own unpleasant codes, Ned discovers. Don't hold anyone's gaze too long. Don't show too much enthusiasm. Don't be apologetic about anything. Show no weakness. This - and the essential deceit - brings Vincent to the verge of a nervous breakdown. Instead of feeling powerful and dominating, Ned finds being a man depressing and exhausting. You have to put on a constant show of 'maleness'.
This feeling isn't just about being a woman trapped in a man's body. Most men, Vincent claims, feel this way. They are constantly having to fight to assert their identity, hide their emotions, to be the Man. Vincent hates to admit it initially, but men, too, have their cross to bear. They're all faking it to some extent. The disguise of being a man, she notes at her last all-men bonding session, 'was the one thing I had in common with every guy in the room'.

North Korea sent a protest letter to the United Nations over the joint Korea-U.S. military exercises last week, the Voice of America (VOA) reported Tuesday.
According to the VOA report, North Korea's U.N. Ambassador Ja Song-nam wrote to French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre, who is president of the U.N. Security Council, saying, "Washington and Seoul are conducting nuclear war practice against the North."
The letter was sent a day after Korea-U.S. military drills began on March 2. They are scheduled to continue until next Monday.
Ja attached a recent statement Pyongyang issued to denounce the joint drills, and called on the Security Council president to designate the statement along with the letter as an official document of the U.N. Security Council, the VOA said.
Pyongyang has reverted to saber rattling and threatening to take countermeasures against the annual drills.
In an apparent protest against the start of the joint military exercises, it launched two short-range missiles into the East Sea last Monday.
In response, Seoul wrote to the U.N. two days later, calling for punishment of Pyongyang for its test-firings, according to a government source.

A SCOTS expat has finally restored his nation's honour by paying back a 121-year-old debt to an Australian racing club.
Scots-born poet and horseman Will Ogilvie is notorious in New South Wales for failing to pay the one guinea bill from 1892 – and then returning to Scotland in 1901.
But the Barringun Jockey Club bill has finally been paid after Ian Forbes, 76, walked in and arranged for a crisp Royal Bank of Scotland £5 to be handed over.
Ian, who emigrated from Edinburgh to Australia, was on a two-day Poets Trek tour of the outback when he decided it was finally time to do the decent thing on behalf of his motherland.
The literary tour includes Will Ogilvie, who was born near Kelso in the Scottish Borders in 1869, and lived and worked around the tiny community of Barringun in the 1890s.
In Barringun's only bar, Ian, a retired marine engineer and lifetime fan of Ogilvie's poetry, was shown the racing club's membership ledger – with the writer's name still clear.
Ian immediately pulled out his wallet and offered to pay up.
He said: “I won't hear a bad word about Will Ogilvie. I think they were quite surprised.
“They'd shown the ledger to hundreds of people but I was the first one who had offered to pay.”
But he was told Australian currency would not do.
“The chap there said, ‘No, no, I want pounds.'
“So I agreed to send him five pounds. I got a friend in Scotland to send me a Scottish fiver and the chap at the pub is going to hang it on the wall with a photograph of a sketch of Ogilvie which I gave him.”
Although the debt has been settled, Scotland appears to have got a cheap deal. Adjusted for inflation, the unpaid guinea is worth approximately £113.
Ogilvie spent 12 years in Australia, and Ian believes the poet may have been unable to pay the debt as he was working as a cattle drover and traveled long distances frequently.
Ian, who has relatives in Kelso, Scottish Borders, became interested in Ogilvie when he discovered a family connection.
Ian's father worked in a bank in the Scottish Borders and counted the poet among his customers.
He said: “My father had mentioned it to my sister and she told me and it was that which got me interested and I started getting a few books of Ogilvie's poetry.”

Ever since the news of the revival of American comedy-drama series “Gilmore Girls” broke out, the speculations surrounding the star cast and other updates of the series started doing the rounds.
The latest update about the series is about its exciting plot details. One out of the four main characters of the series will get a new love interest in the comeback version of the show, TV Line reported. The four major characters of “Gilmore Girls” are Luke, Lorelai, Rory and Emily. It will be exciting to see which character is set to get a romantic angle this time.
Netflix is reportedly working on the comeback of “Gilmore Girls” and has planned to pull out four 90-minute episodes in the revival edition. The news of revival of “Gilmore Girls” was let out by TV Line's Michael Ausiello in October.
The buzz also suggests that Luke and Lorelai, who are known for their undying love for each other, will also decide to part ways, the website reported. Luke and Lorelai's devastating breakup will lend a new angle to the story. Yet another update about the show is that the story will also address the death of Edward Herrmann, who portrayed the role of Emily's husband and Lorelai's father and died in 2014.
The key actors of the show, including Kelly Bishop, Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, are expected to make a comeback with this series that ended eight years back.
Amy Sherman-Palladino helmed this series, which featured Lauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore and Alexis Bledel as Rory Gilmore. The original version of the show premiered on WB in October 2000 and the final episode of its last season – season 7 - aired on May 15, 2007.
The show became very popular back then and was listed as one of Time magazine's "All-TIME 100 TV Shows" in 2007.
On learning about the recent updates of the show, lead star Lauren Graham took to Twitter to talk about it.
“DUDES. I can't confirm this. But I also can't deny this,” read her Twitter post.

Giuseppe Rossi's incredible story doesn't have a happy ending.
The American-born forward, hampered throughout his career by a series of debilitating knee injuries, has been excluded from Italy's 23-man World Cup squad, which was released by manager Cesare Prandelli on Sunday.
To say the news came as a shock to many supporters is an understatement. Suffice it to say, the word 'gutted' made its fair share of appearances on social media in the immediate aftermath of the announcement.
The news is devastating for the Fiorentina striker, who worked so admirably to come back after enduring yet another setback with his troublesome right knee in January.
Devastated for Rossi. Worked so hard to come back again and again, only to miss out now because of a rotten challenge from Rinaudo. — Paolo Bandini (@Paolo_Bandini) June 1, 2014
Rossi, who featured in Saturday's friendly against Ireland and performed admirably despite not seeing much of the ball, was beaten out by pint-sized Napoli youngster Lorenzo Insigne, who at 22 years old will likely be the fifth option in a supremely talented group of attackers.
Other cuts include Riccardo Montolivo, whose hopes of featuring in Brazil came to a terrible end when he suffered a broken tibia in the aforementioned friendly at Craven Cottage.
Defenders Christian Maggio, Andrea Ranocchia, Manuel Pasqual along with midfielder Romulo and striker Mattia Destro also received the unfortunate news of their omission on Sunday.
Here is the full squad that Prandelli has decided to take with him to Brazil:
Goalkeepers
Gianluigi Buffon (Juventus), Salvatore Sirigu (Paris Saint-Germain), Mattia Perin (Genoa)
Defenders
Giorgio Chiellini (Juventus), Leonardo Bonucci (Juventus), Ignazio Abate (Milan), Gabriel Paletta (Parma), Andrea Barzagli (Juventus), Mattia De Sciglio (Milan), Matteo Darmian (Torino)
Midfielders
Andrea Pirlo (Juventus), Antonio Candreva (Lazio), Claudio Marchisio (Juventus), Daniele De Rossi (Roma), Thiago Motta (Paris Saint-Germain), Marco Verratti (Paris Saint-Germain), Marco Parolo (Parma), Alberto Aquilani (Fiorentina)
Forwards
Mario Balotelli (Milan), Ciro Immobile (Torino), Lorenzo Insigne (Napoli), Antonio Cassano (Parma), Alessio Cerci (Torino)
Italy will begin their World Cup adventure on June 14 with a match against England.

MUNCIE, Ind. — Since local, state and federal authorities raided a pain doctor's clinic in Muncie in October 2014, overdoses from illegal opioids such as heroin and fentanyl have exploded.
For most of the decade before authorities raided William Hedrick's pain clinic on Muncie's north side, Delaware County EMS responded to a couple of hundred overdose calls a year.
In the three years since that raid, ambulance runs for overdoses have nearly doubled and are more than four times what they were in the years before that. In the first 10 months of 2017, ambulances rolled on 753 overdose calls and EMS gave 556 doses of overdose recovery drug Narcan, compared to 226 overdose calls and 152 doses of Narcan in 2013.
And overdose deaths as determined by the Delaware County coroner's office have jumped from 41 in 2015 to 54 through in the first nine months of 2017.
National health statistics say that in Delaware County, 35 percent of all deaths of all those ages 15 to 44 are from overdoses, The New York Times reported on Oct. 26.
Authorities say they don't doubt that busting Hedrick's operation forced his patients to turn from dangerously over-prescribed pills and pain injections to heroin and, more recently, the synthetic opioid fentanyl.
"I don't think there's any question it did," Delaware County Prosecutor Jeffrey Arnold told The Star Press. "I have defendants say to me, 'What do you expect? You shut it down.'"
But Arnold said he doesn't regret cooperating with state and federal authorities in busting Hedrick.
"I'm not going to be responsible for somebody's addiction," Arnold said.
'A huge case'
Physician William Hedrick, who practiced medicine in northern Indiana, opened his Muncie office, known variously as the Center for Pain Relief or Indiana Pain Center, in July 2013. At that time, The Star Press noted that Hedrick had already been placed on a two-year probation by the Indiana Medical Licensing Board.
The Muncie office, in Lyndenbrook, quickly took on patients — sometimes a hundred or more a day — and Hedrick and his staff wrote pain medication prescriptions and administered pain-relief injections, the latter at a cost of up to $1,000 each. Hedrick practiced at several offices in the northern half of the state.
Zach Craig, the deputy prosecutor who oversaw the October 2014 raid and has handled the case since, said Hedrick's office's revenue came in large part from insurance and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.
Craig said that as far as he knows, no one has definitively tallied the amount of money that moved through Hedrick's practice. "The number of offices, the number of employees, times 100 patients a day," Craig said. "But I haven't heard a dollar figure."
The raid of the Muncie office resulted in three counts of forgery, three counts of prescribing controlled substances with a surrendered DEA registration number, two counts of unlawful dispensing of a controlled substance, Medicaid fraud and four counts of corrupt business influence being filed against Hedrick.
Hedrick's trial has been postponed several times since charges were filed. The most recent trial date set is March 19, 2018, a revised trial date since August, when his defense attorney withdrew from the case.
But even though the trial date has been postponed, Craig said work on the case has not slowed.
"That never stops our investigation" and determination if other charges should be filed, Craig said.
The prosecutor's office investigation has amounted to "thousands" of staff hours, Arnold said. "That's a huge case for an office our size."
The impact of the case has been great not only on the prosecution, however.
Jump in ODs, Narcan doses
For months, Delaware County law enforcement and emergency services officials have spoken publicly about the impact of heroin and fentanyl abuse, with an increasing number of arrests, prosecutions and overdoses, both fatal and otherwise.
And while Delaware County's EMS ambulance service has, for more than a decade, responded to overdose calls, the number of OD runs only topped 200 beginning in 2012 and instances in which Narcan were administered only topped 100 that same year.
But in 2014, the year of the pain clinic raid, overdose calls nearly doubled, to 402, then increased to 618 in 2015.
In 2016, OD runs for the ambulance service jumped to 703 and Narcan doses increased to 435.
In the first 10 months of 2017, overdoses jumped to 753 and Narcan doses increased to 556.
IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital's Emergency Department treats an average of 1.5 overdoses a day, the hospital said last week.
The increase in heroin and fentanyl overdoses in Muncie and Delaware County has been widely reported. But the outsized impact on death rates is staggering.
Citing numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Health Statistics, As part of a county-by-county national overview of overdose deaths, The New York Times reported in October that 35 percent of the deaths of Delaware County residents ages 15 to 44 are overdoses.
In surrounding counties, Wayne County is closest in number, with 29 percent, followed by 26 percent in Madison and Blackford counties. Other counties in the area range from 14 to 16 percent.
Deaths before and after the pain clinic
According to figures released by Delaware County Coroner Scott Hahn, overdose deaths in the past three years have been spread over a broad demographic.
In March 2017, for example, eight people in Delaware County died from overdoses. Four were women and four were men. Their ages ranged from 20 to 57.
Arnold said authorities know that "pill mills" — medical offices that traditionally are an easy source of prescriptions — create addiction, so it's no surprise that when the supply was cut off, some turned to their family doctors and some turned to what Arnold called "street pharmacies."
"It created a huge void of supply, and that supply was filled by drugs on the street, including heroin, and that was even before fentanyl," Arnold added.
Arnold and Craig said that local, state and federal authorities couldn't stand by and let Hedrick operate: Early on, authorities said his practice caused the deaths of eight people through over-prescribed medication.

Delaware County's drug overdose problem by the numbers
In Delaware County, 35 percent of all deaths of all those ages 15 to 44 are overdoses, The New York Times reported on Oct. 26.
Nationally, drug overdoses have increased by more than 650 percent since 1990.
Local overdose response/treatment
In Delaware County, drug overdoses have increased steadily since 2004 but have taken a jump since local, state and federal authorities raided the northside pain clinic of physician William Hedrick in October 2014.
(Note: While overdoses can spring from many sources, including alcohol, the number of doses of Narcan, a heroin overdose recovery drug used to revive overdose patients, is an indicator of how many heroin and fentanyl overdoses that Delaware County Emergency Medical Service personnel have responded to.
2004: 152 Overdose Calls / / Gave 153 doses of NARCAN

Did you hear? Sonic the Hedgehog got picked up by comic book publisher IDW. That means it's only a matter of time until the furry blue runner's first really weird crossover.
The new partnership was revealed last week after Sega announced Sonic comics would no longer be coming via Archie. Naturally, everyone's wandering what this could mean for the future of Sonic on the printed page given IDW's penchant for stuff like this:
So in this week's ‘Shop Contest, I want you to come up with the weirdest Sonic crossover you can think of. Like that time the chili dog eating fiend teamed up with Spawn, except times a million. Maybe Sonic races the Flash, or saves Optimus Prime, or, hell, somehow arrives in the Mass Effect universe via a wormhole and has to mine planets for iridium in order to go back in time and prevent the Reapers from ever being created. Or, I mean, maybe he just gets into a hot dog eating contest with the Blob, who knows?
The rules are below. See you next weekend with the winners!

Review: Talisman: The Blood Moon By JP Marr
The Blood Moon first rose over the world of Talisman in 2012 when it was released as the seventh expansion for the tabletop game Talisman Fourth Edition. Nomad has ported it to Talisman: Digital Edition as the eighth proper expansion (excluding character packs), skipping The Dragon expansion (2011) for now and letting The City and The Nether Realm expansions (2013, 2014) cut in line. As a “small box” expansion, Blood Moon provides additional cards and characters tied to a common theme. This time that theme is the evergreen setting of Gothic Horror. Was Magic: The Gathering's return to Innistrad the high point of your summer? Are you still upset about Penny Dreadful's cancellation? If so, I've got excellent news.
The two signature mechanisms of this expansion that serve as vehicles for the theme are the day/night cycle and the eponymous Blood Moon Werewolf. Many of the 111 new event cards are Lunar Events, which when revealed can trigger daybreak or nightfall and then stay in play as modifiers until the next cycle. If a card that would trigger, say, daybreak comes out during the day it's just added to the stack of modifiers and a streak of similarly-timed cards can result in some wild turns. The day/night cycle itself also tags enemy encounters with a +1 or -1 respectively, so I was very happy to let the app do the bookkeeping. All the payoff, none of the math!
TMW your Vampire Hunter uses a Wooden Stake to score an automatic win against the Vampire Prince.
Blood Moon also takes advantage of the abstracted passage of time to provide a new alternative ending, Lightbringers, which is fully cooperative. One player must access the center space of the board before a set number of days have passed. Depending on how the cards come out, this scenario can feel pretty leisurely paced, but I really appreciated the added sense of immediacy to the AI-driven gameplay. While Talisman expansions usually find ways to up the inter-player cruelty, cooperative games are becoming ever more popular, and I think this ending will be a selling point for co-op fans.
Much like the original Reaper expansion, Blood Moon adds a player-controlled figure in the form of the Blood Moon Werewolf. When any player rolls a one for movement, they'll get to take a turn for the werewolf, which involves rolling for movement and hopefully having an opportunity to ambush one of your opponents. That's obviously the idea of this element, but in practice you often welcome a visit from the Werewolf. The worst roll you can get on the werewolf chart results in lycanthropy, which in the game, as in real life, is frikkin' sweet. You get boosts to combat at night, better rolls on the werewolf chart and… oh yeah, instant death if you draw the Peasant Mob card. I guess it can't be all werewolf dance parties under the pale moonlight.
More like Fairy God-wolf.
If you've purchased many of the existing expansions your character selection screen already has more choices than Marvel vs. Capcom, but Blood Moon diligently offers three new choices, all of which have interesting interactions with the encounter deck, either accelerating (Doomsayer, Vampire Hunter) or decelerating (Grave Robber) your draw rate. If you're playing the Lightbringers scenario or depend on Lunar Events this provides a real push-your-luck feel. Thematically, the Vampire Hunter is the most on-the-nose of the new characters, but there are many others you might want to bring in for their suitability, or interactions with the now Spirit-heavy encounter deck, like the Vampiress or Exorcist. You'll also want to play through as a spellcaster to sample some of the new spells. There are only ten added to the deck, but they display a variety of effects, from raising enemies as single-use zombies to straight up cursing another player with lycanthropy. Besides, any additional spells are welcome as the base game's selection is pretty thin and only situationally useful.
Lightbringers is the stand-out alternative ending card, but even though it's unique in the way it flips the Talisman script it might not even be the most game-changing. I'll save that honor for Horrible Black Void. If you play with hidden endings and own only Blood Moon in addition to the base game you have three possibilities when you ascend the steps in the center of the board, you grab the Crown of Power and engage in base Talisman's ungainly endgame, you reveal the other new alternative ending which starts a battle between humans and lycanthropes or you instantly lose the game. I'm not comfortable with a 33% chance of something cool happening so I've only played a few games with hidden endings and never got to see the Blood Moon Werewolf ending play out.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Of course, whether you succeed or not, Talisman is a game of moments. Any additional content must be judged on the basis of whether or not it increases the frequency of memorable turns. Talisman's world is so generic I spent five minutes googling “what is the setting of Talisman” before realizing it's called Talisman. Fantasy is too ubiquitous to be highly evocative and while Gothic Horror may well be on its way to a similar ubiquity, it feels like a huge improvement over the base game when it comes to narrative.
I've played Talisman on the table, I've played the app from back in its Prologue days, but it took The Blood Moon expansion for me to fall in love with the system. Now that I've seen the potential for the minimalist gameplay to tell an interesting story, my copy of Talisman will no longer be moldering away in iCloud. I'd recommend The Blood Moon as a first expansion for others that are similarly on the fence about Talisman's gameplay, because it's great as a stand-alone addition. It doesn't necessarily play well with others as the Lunar Event cards could become too infrequent to have much effect on gameplay, and the world building would become muddled when combined with other event decks. This is in tension, however, with the alternative ending cards which certainly want to be part of a larger pool. If you don't need convincing, I'd recommend The Reaper expansion instead. It has more long-term value; when you start playing with additional expansions you'll see The Reaper as an extension of the core set that never leaves circulation.
Danny Davis grabs gold in Snowboard SuperPipe
Danny Davis scores a 95.00 on his second run in the Men's Snowboard SuperPipe final at X Games Aspen 2014 and wins his first X Games gold.
ASPEN, Colo. -- In a momentous close to X Games Aspen 2014, Danny Davis won gold in the men's Snowboard SuperPipe on Sunday night, beating out Louie Vito and Greg Bretz. It was Davis' first time qualifying for the final in six X Games appearances.
"I can't believe it really," said Davis, who set himself apart with rare and stylish technical tricks like a huge switch method and tweaked-out McTwist, as well as the double cork spins that have become standard in this event. "I'm going to ride this switch method train as long as it will last."
Davis lamented the fact that six-time Snowboard SuperPipe champion Shaun White was absent from the contest. White skipped X Games Aspen this year to focus on training for the Sochi Olympics, where he's competing in both halfpipe and slopestyle.
"It's bittersweet when Shaun's not here -- you know, he's the one to beat -- but forget it, I'll take it," Davis said.
Davis, Bretz and Taylor Gold -- who missed the cut for the final -- will join White next month in Sochi with the U.S. Olympic team.
Swiss rider Iouri Podladtchikov, whose switch frontside 1440 "YOLO flip" might have been unbeatable if he had been able to land it cleanly in the final Sunday, finished in sixth, and Chinese rider Yiwei Zhang, an X Games rookie, made a big impression but ultimately finished in seventh place.
Monster Energy Snowmobile SnoCross
Tucker Hibbert claimed his seventh consecutive gold medal in the Monster Energy Snowmobile SnoCross on Sunday, making him the record holder for the most back-to-back gold medals of any winter X Games athlete.
Brett Wilhelm/ESPN Tucker Hibbert earned a record seven-peat in Snowmobile SnoCross.
Hibbert, who previously was tied at six gold medals in a row with Snowboard SuperPipe dominator Shaun White, now is in hot pursuit of BMX Vert legend Jamie Bestwick's record eight-gold streak at summer X Games.
On Sunday, Hibbert beat silver medalist Kody Kamm by 13.75 seconds on the course. Justin Broberg got the bronze.
"It means the world, man, it's awesome," Hibbert said. "It's a tough race when you're in the lead, and the track was getting pretty gnarly toward the end. ... I'm pumped to have the seven-peat. I get older every year and I just wonder if this is going to keep going. We'll find out next year."
Hibbert was the top qualifier in the first heat, then lapped some of the field in the final. He took an early lead, squeezing ahead of Kamm for the hole shot, then staying out in front, leaving Kamm and Broberg to battle it out for second place.
Men's Ski Slopestyle
Nick Goepper won his second consecutive X Games Aspen Ski Slopestyle gold medal Sunday, kicking off the final day of competition and becoming the first to repeat in men's Ski Slopestyle since Tanner Hall's three-win streak ended in 2004.
Brett Wilhelm/ESPN "It's going to be crazy," Nick Goepper said about freeskiing's Olympic debut. "Definitely keep your eyes open and wake up at 2 in the morning to watch the show."
"I feel honored to be in the same category as Tanner but couldn't be more honored to be here with my homies," Goepper said, specifically shouting out to competitors McRae Williams and Andreas Håtveit, the silver and bronze medalists, respectively. "It's Andreas' last time here, so it couldn't have been a better day."
Håtveit, who will compete in Sochi with the Norwegian Olympic team, has announced this will be his last competitive season.
On his second run, Gus Kenworthy landed a switch triple rodeo 1440, the first triple cork landed in an X Games Ski Slopestyle competition. Goepper brought the second -- a rightside triple cork 1440 in his second run -- to bump into second place and landed it again in an even cleaner third run, improving to 95, the highest score of the day.
Goepper, who broke two bones in his left hand this past fall, skied his run with a wrist brace and no poles.
He was the first to qualify for the U.S. Freeskiing Olympic team and will lead the charge as the team heads to Sochi for freeskiing's Olympic debut.
"It's going to be crazy," he said. "Definitely keep your eyes open and wake up at 2 in the morning to watch the show."
Henrik Harlaut, the Ski Big Air gold medalist from Saturday night, just missed the Slopestyle podium, finishing in fourth.
Women's Ski Slopestyle
Canadian Kaya Turski was back in familiar territory Sunday with her fourth career X Games Aspen gold medal in women's Ski Slopestyle.
Joshua Duplechian/ESPN Kaya Turski returned to gold status in the women's Ski Slopestyle final at XG Aspen.
Turski beat 15-year-old X Games rookie and silver medalist Maggie Voisin, now the youngest skier in history to medal at X Games, a distinction previously held by Aspen local Torin Yater-Wallace. Canadian Kim Lamarre took bronze.
"It's been a crazy week. It's been a crazy journey," Turski said about her first major contest after getting a revolutionary ACL surgery in August. "I couldn't believe it when I blew my knee five months ago, but here I am. I just tried to keep everything clean, just get my flow back, get it back in the zone, and it paid off."
The win follows her X Games Tignes 2013 Slopestyle gold and is a return to form for Turski, who dominated the event at X Games Aspen from 2010 to 2012 before taking silver in 2013 behind Norway's Tiril Sjåstad Christiansen, who is currently out of contention with a knee injury.
The biggest surprise of the day came from Montana native Voisin, a member of the U.S. Freeskiing Olympic team headed to Sochi. As the youngest female skier ever to compete at X Games, she delivered a switch 1080 -- the trick Turski first brought to competition in 2012 -- and briefly took the lead after posting the first score in the 90s on her second of three runs.
Turski answered in her third run, outdoing Voisin with her technical rail section and throwing a flatspin 540, switch 540 Japan and switch cork 720 in the jumps, bumping ahead with a score of 91.33.
SnoCross Adaptive
Mike Schultz won his fourth consecutive gold medal in SnoCross Adaptive on Sunday. Schultz dominated SnoCross Adaptive at X Games in 2010, 2011 and 2013 (the event was not contested at X Games Aspen 2012).
Schultz is an above-the-knee amputee who developed the prosthetic knee technology he and other adaptive racing competitors use. He finished more than 13 seconds ahead of silver medalist Garrett Goodwin and bronze medalist Doug Henry, who both use custom snowmobile seats for paraplegic racers.
Schultz, an X Games SnoCross competitor since 2002 before losing his left leg in a 2008 accident, also has a summer X Games streak going: He has won the Moto X Adaptive Racing event twice now, in 2010 and 2013.
Sunday's win in Aspen brings his overall X Games medal count to seven, six of them gold.
It looks more and more like people will not be traveling or shopping this holiday season.
The Federal Reserve released its monthly consumer credit report which showed activity decrease at an annual rate of 6 percent in the third quarter of 2009.
Total US consumer credit fell $14.8 billlion in September. Of that, revolving credit fell $9.9 billion.
The survey shows that 34% of outstanding consumer credit is held by banks and 21% by finance companies.
After peaking in the fourth quarter of last year, consumer credit has fallen in each quarter since. The prospect that the trend will continue for the October through December period gives support to the notion that the holiday season will be a harsh one for retailers.
The second wave of the recession that is ending now was set off by terrible holiday sales last year which came just two months after the first wave caused by the financial crisis in the financial markets. Retail sales were so poor that hundreds of thousand of workers in the sector and business that supply the sector were laid off and thousands of stores closed.
The true effect of an awful retail season this holiday will not be clear until the first quarter of next year, but the new consumer credit numbers are not a healthy start.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former President Bill Clinton said he “could have killed” Osama bin Laden in remarks to an audience in Australia the day before al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on the United States, according to an audio tape that emerged this week.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton gives a keynote address at a conference on "inclusive capitalism" organised by the City of London, in London May 27, 2014. REUTERS/Anna Gordon/Financial Times Live/Conference on Inclusive Capitalism/Pool
Clinton and officials from his administration have expressed similar sentiments both before and after the Sept. 11 attacks that killed more than 3,000 people but the recording appears to have attracted attention because he was speaking less than 36 hours before al Qaeda hijackers would board four airliners for attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
On the tape Clinton said he declined to pursue one opportunity to kill bin Laden in Afghanistan because it would have risked killing hundreds of civilians.
“And I'm just saying, you know, if I were Osama bin Laden -he's a very smart guy. I spent a lot of time thinking about him. And I nearly got him once,” Clinton can be heard saying as people in the audience laugh.
“I nearly got him,” Clinton continues. “And I could have killed him but I would have had to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and killed 300 innocent women and children and then I would have been no better than him. And so I didn't do it.”
The recording was made with Clinton's knowledge by Michael Kroger, the former head of Australia's Liberal Party, at a speaking engagement in Melbourne on Sept. 10, 2001, Kroger told Australia's Sky News, which broadcast the 30-second excerpt.
Kroger told Sky News he only recently recalled he had the recording.
The 9/11 Commission Report recounts an episode in December 1998 where Clinton's administration considered a cruise missile strike to kill bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian founder of al Qaeda, after learning he would be in Kandahar. The strike was not launched because of a fear that perhaps 300 other people could be killed or injured, the report says.
Clinton left office about nine months before the Sept. 11 attacks but had focused on Bin Laden as the mastermind of the bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998 that killed more than 200 people.
A U.S. special forces military team killed bin Laden in a 2011 raid in Pakistan.

Let's start out with a little background, paint a little landscape for you in order to frame what I am about to say. I am a Rangers fan. I sat in the blue seats while Mario Lemieux scored six goals in one game at Madison Square Garden. I didn't leave. I watched and learned that greatness sometimes is stronger than will alone.
With that said, on Tuesday night, these 2013-2014 Rangers had neither greatness nor will.
But this rant is not about that. It is more specifically about rumblings in the organization that the young squire, Tomas Hertl, was showboating when he scored all nine goals against the Rangers after… Oh, it was only four goals? Not only was it four goals, if you took those goals out of the equation, the Rangers still lose 5-2. So after all is said and done, should Hertl not have his coming out party untarnished by those who would claim showboating has no place in this league?
At the beginning of last season, I wrote a piece on why there should be more douchers in hockey. This right here is a great example of why. The exposure this smiley, baby-faced little podling with the rear end the size of Jaromir Jagr and the cajones the size of cannonballs, has gotten in the past two days has been not only breathtaking, but also important for hockey. People love a scene (see: NBA and Lebron James).
If I were in the New York Rangers organization, I would figure out how to fix the piss-poor slot coverage instead of trying to rain on the Hertl Power parade. You know who isn't whining about showboating? Many players in the league have congratulated Hertl for breathing life into a San Jose franchise that just can't seem to get over the hump.
Think about Jumbo Joe Thornton, whose comment today has drawn ire from the stuffed shirts, and have been applauded by just about every decent journalist anywhere – along with millions of fans. Anyone who is condemning these comments either has no sense of humor, or needs to find themselves a surgeon to remove the giant lead pipe from their bowels. And honestly, anyone who wants to defecate on what young Sir Hertl did on Tuesday should probablyseek out the same services.
To Washington Capitals bench boss Adam Oates specifically, I would like to say this: If you do not think that what Tomas Hertle did on Tuesday was not elite skill, then you have no business coaching Alex “King of the Douchers” Ovechkin. Ovechkin REGULARLY makes his opponents look silly. Not only that, Ovechkin takes it to the next level by celebrating with pure joy and exuberance unmatched by anyone. Oates, shame on you, if you're asking Ovie to curb that joie de vivre.
To the New York Rangers who grumbled amongst themselves so silently that there wasn't even a solid quote: I don't hear any of your fans grumbling about the Hertl between the legs embarrassment of a 7th goal. Mostly I hear myself and the rest of Blueshirt Nation grumbling about how bad we looked defensively in 2 out of our 3 premier games in this young season. If I were Team Vigneault, I'd be more worried about how they're going to fix the slot coverage in their defensive end instead of whining about how one young forward's exuberance earned him a place on the bench for the balance of the game.
I say “bravo”, Tomas, I look forward to seeing many more nights like that from you. And to Jumbo: If you score 4 goals in a game this season, I will make sure NOT to tune into the post game report. That's not the kind of hockey porn I want to see.
And THAT, my friends, is the last EFFIN' WORD!

Frank Isola of the New York Daily News dropped an article on Tuesday with sourced information regarding Kevin Durant's free agency.
“The same source maintains that if Durant doesn't re-sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder he would prefer to join the Warriors, a team that has reached two straight NBA Finals and could rule the Western Conference for the next five years if Durant goes to the Bay Area.”
Durant's OKC squad nearly knocked the Warriors off in the Western Conference Finals. In the series, Durant averaged 30.0 points per game, 8.0 rebounds and played tremendous defense with his long arms.
After losing the NBA Finals, Warriors owner Joe Lacob vowed his team would be aggressive in the offseason. Much more on this story to come.
EXCLUSIVE: In 2014, a single U.S. government agency was hit with a blizzard of more than 1,370 external attacks on its most vital computer systems, with three out of every eight incidents resulting in a loss of data, according to a new report by the watchdog Government Accountability Office, suggesting hackers have been far more successful at getting at sensitive government information than previously disclosed.
The highly besieged agency was not named in the report, which was given to government officials in May and made public last week. GAO officials declined to provide the name of the agency in response to an additional query from Fox News.
The eye-opening number of data leaks that resulted from the attacks -- 516 “incidents” in all -- is barely mentioned in the 94-page GAO report.
It is mostly buried in the fine print of an information diagram on page 24 of the wordy and technical document.
The fact that the data losses all came from one agency is mentioned only in a footnote to the diagram, and the extraordinary success rate of the attacks has to be calculated from figures speckled on the previous page.
Fox News calculations of the success rate and number of attacks were subsequently affirmed by GAO officials.
The specific nature and importance of the torrent of data losses was not revealed.
A one-page executive summary of the GAO report that is the most likely portion to be read by policymakers or the general public makes no mention of data losses, or of the high success rate of attacks that caused them, or of the focus of the attacks on a single agency.

The high rate of attacks and successes in 2014 has particular significance for U.S. cybersecurity, however.
It was 2014 when the Obama administration revealed one of the worst losses of cyber-information in history had taken place, with the theft of 4.2 million personnel files of past and former U.S. federal civil servants from its Office of Personnel Management (OPM) by China-based intruders.
That loss was subsequently expanded in revelations a month later by 21.5 million sensitive background files on federal civil servants and contractors, after another hack that year, also believed to come from China, removed the huge quantities of sensitive personal information from a private background-checking firm.
On its website, OPM customarily refers to the losses as coming from only two “separate but related incidents” -- a far cry from the triple-digit data loss numbers stashed away in the GAO report.
A Fox News query to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the effectiveness of cybersecurity across the federal system, yielded no additional information about the figures in the carefully-groomed GAO report.
The computer assault information, along with much of the other information in the GAO document, came from the self-reporting of a swarm of 24 U.S. federal agencies that responded to a survey asking, among other things, about their “high-impact” federal information systems and cyberattacks.
The GAO audit, which took place between February 2015 and May 2016, came at the request of a trio of U.S. senators: Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee; Thomas Carper, D-Del., the committee ranking member; and Susan Collins, R-Maine.
According to the report, 18 federal agencies have such “high-impact” systems, defined dramatically but opaquely as those where “the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability can have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, assets or individuals.”
During 2014, only 11 of the 18 reported 2,267 cyberattacks on their “high-impact” facilities; another three failed to provide any specific numbers of such assaults.
Virtually all of the agencies designated “nations” -- meaning foreign ones -- as the most serious and frequently-occurring source of the threat.
The GAO report may be highly circumspect about the success of high-impact attacks, but it is far more forthright in noting that cross-government authorities it included in the audit -- including the Office of Personnel Management -- had lots of guidance on how to protect themselves, but even now are still not doing enough to make sure the guidance was followed.
It noted, among other things, that OPM and other agencies had not done well in tracking whether special security training for employees in sensitive roles had been carried out, and none of them had fully completed remedial plans to correct “identified weaknesses” in their high-impact systems security.
For its part, OPM pushed back in a rebuttal that other means than directly tracking the completion of training were more effective and appropriate, especially for contractors, a conclusion that the GAO report did not accept.
OPM also argued that it had made further improvements to its security controls after the GAO audit was done that were not included in the report. GAO's answer: The document “reflects the state of information security at the time of our review.”
The fact is that the entire Obama administration is still in the throes of carrying out a sweeping revamp of cybersecurity strategy that, according to some critics, is still far from a coherent answer to the active and still growing cyber-threat.
The senators who sparked the latest report may soon be focusing on some of those shortcomings. They are preparing to look further into the issues raised in the GAO document, which include the muffled and unsettling question of those hundreds of data losses.

It is about that time when actors for The Walking Dead are reassembling back in Atlanta to begin work on season 5 of the AMC zombie drama. With that in mind, we caught up with Daryl Dixon himself, Norman Reedus, recently and asked how much creator Robert Kirkman and showrunner Scott M. Gimple had told him about what to expect coming up. “A bit,” says Reedus. “Those guys are very good at telling you a bunch of stuff, and you sit there for an hour and you walk away and go, ‘What the hell did he just say? What's going on?' They're very good at masking what they want to tell you.” (As someone that has interviewed both men several times, I can certainly attest to that.)
But that's not to say that Reedus doesn't have any intel for what's in store for Daryl and Co. in season 5. “From what I know, it's gonna be just completely insane,” he says. “I sort of knew I needed like a good month to rest to jump in. The storyline they're throwing me is a thousand miles an hour.”
While the back half of season 4 featured smaller and often slower stories in the interest of offering deeper character dives, it would seem that with the cliffhanger of having most of the group needing to escape from train car A at Terminus that the pace is definitely about to quicken. And Reedus' comments would appear to confirm that.

The White House disagreed Wednesday with Ashton Carter, President Obama's nominee for secretary of defense, on providing lethal arms to Ukraine's beleaguered military.
Shortly after Mr. Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he favors providing defensive arms to Ukraine in its fight against pro-Russian rebels, the White House issued a reminder that Mr. Obama is the boss.
“A decision like this will be made by the commander in chief,” said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, adding that Mr. Carter is “a strong believer in the chain of command.”
Mr. Obama has been resisting calls from Congress to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, although the U.S. has provided a variety of other aid to Kiev.
At his confirmation hearing Wednesday, Mr. Carter said he favors sending arms to Kiev in the fight against Russian separatists.
“I very much incline in that direction,” he said, adding “we need to support the Ukrainians in defending themselves.”
Mr. Carter didn't specify the weapons to be considered but said, “I incline in the direction of providing them with arms, including to get to what I'm sure your question is, lethal arms.”

French cement maker Lafarge entered into deals with armed groups in Syria, including the Islamic State (IS) group, in order to protect its business interests in the country, French daily Le Monde reported Tuesday.
ADVERTISING Read more
According to the French newspaper, between 2013 and 2014 Lafarge paid taxes to IS group middlemen and negotiated safe passage for its trucks and employees in order to continue its operations in northern Syria.
Lafarge, the world's leader in construction materials, did not respond to queries from AFP over the allegations, saying only that its "absolute priority has always been ensuring the safety and security of its staff".
At the heart of the "murky deals" alleged by Le Monde is a cement works that Lafarge bought in 2007 some 150 kilometres (95 miles) northeast of Aleppo.
The Jalabiya cement works went into operation in 2010, a year before the start of Syria's ongoing civil war.
"Until 2013, production kept up despite the growing instability in the region due to the civil war," the French daily wrote.
In 2013, the IS group – then known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) – began taking control of towns and roads around the factory.
Le Monde reported it had seen emails sent by Lafarge managers in Syria "revealing arrangements that Lafarge made with the jihadist group to continue production until September 19, 2014".
It was on this date that the IS group took over the site and Lafarge halted all activity.
IS group stamp
In one case Lafarge – seeking access to its factory for workers and supplies – sent a man named Ahmad Jaloudi on a mission "to get permission from IS group to let employees past checkpoints".
According to Le Monde, the letters show that Lafarge's Paris headquarters was aware of the arrangements.
In another case a "pass stamped with an IS group stamp and endorsed by the (group's) finance chief in the Aleppo region" proves the company had struck a deal with IS group to allow for free circulation of its goods, the newspaper reported.
In order to keep making cement Lafarge bought licences from and paid taxes to IS group middle-men and oil traders, the newspaper alleged.
Lafarge – which in 2015 merged with Swiss cement maker Holcim – confirmed to AFP it had owned the Jalabiya cement works "between 2010 and 2014", but did not directly address the allegations.
"When fighting came closer to the factory, Lafarge's absolute priority was ensuring the safety and security of its staff while the closure of the factory was being studied," the company said.
IS group militants were driven out of the Jalabiya area by Kurdish forces in February 2015.
According to Le Monde, the site is now used as a base for US, French and British special forces that support the Kurds in their fight against the jihadists.

Mohammed is now in Calais, from where he hopes to get into Britain
He stands on the windswept sand dunes of Northern France, only 22 miles across the sea from Dover's White Cliffs and the country he hopes to make his new home.
Mohammed Solebi risked his life to get to Calais, smuggled from the war-divided Middle East with nothing but his Syrian passport in a plastic bag. For seven days he lay in the wet hold of a rusting cargo ship, BlueSkyM, as it was steered in high storms towards Italy by a gang of migrant-traffickers.
The 38-year-old was one of 700 Syrians on the ship, which docked in the Puglian port of Gallipoli on New Year's Eve after Italian maritime authorities boarded the boat to avert a catastrophic shipwreck.

As soon as the migrants on board the stranded boat were brought ashore, many dispersed throughout Italy. Mohammed (pictured left and right) was one of those who headed for the open Italian-French border on the Riviera, crossing by train to the seaside resort of Menton, a few miles into France
The captain had cynically locked the BlueSkyM on autopilot, set a collision course for the rocky coastline two miles ahead and vanished from the wheelhouse, leaving the panic-stricken migrants to send an SOS message for help.
After their rescue, the 700 were taken by bus to holding camps across Italy, in line with EU rules which state that illegal migrants must stay in the first country they reach when they arrive in Europe.
However, the Mail has discovered that most left the camps within hours, with police and immigration officials turning a blind eye because they know that Italy simply cannot cope with the daily influx of migrants, and in the hope that they will disperse to other EU countries.
Mohammed was one of those who headed for the open Italian-French border on the Riviera, crossing by train to the seaside resort of Menton, a few miles into France.
There is no border control between Ventimiglia and Menton on either the motorway or the coast road; merely a sign saying ‘France'. The train line leads to Nice, the Côte d'Azur region's main city, with travel links to Paris and Northern Europe.
A few days ago, Mohammed was the first BlueSkyM migrant to reach Calais, where 2,500 desperate people from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan wait in the hope that they can smuggle themselves on ferries to begin a new life in Britain.
Mohammed, who arrived at Calais on a dawn train from Paris, told me: ‘I know England is a good, strong country because it once had an empire. I want to go there and become an Englishman.'

He said England also has ‘the best weather', is safe because ‘there are CCTV cameras on every street', and it has beautiful old ‘Tudor mansions' to visit.
In Calais this week, a new centre opened, financed by the EU, offering three-course meals cooked by a top French chef for illegal migrants waiting to sneak into Britain.
The centre is more luxurious than the previous refuge, Sangatte, which shut down 12 years ago after UK protests that its very presence had turned Calais into a honeypot for illegal migrants hoping to come to this country.
The new centre, dubbed Sangatte 2, even has a bank of electric sockets so migrants can charge up their mobile phones to talk to their relatives already settled in the UK — many of whom have also smuggled themselves in via Calais.
It is thought that 30 migrants a week smuggle themselves successfully to the UK from the port, yet damning figures show that less than one a week is being sent back.
Mohammed's journey represents a new way of getting to Europe. Until this winter, those fleeing the turbulent Arab spring countries, or poverty-stricken African states, paid for places on small boats organised by smugglers operating out of Libyan ports and sailing towards Italy, Malta or Greece during the summer months.
Now there has been a dramatic upping of the stakes: trafficking gangs are buying big ships, such as the BlueSkyM, for as much as £100,000 to transport migrants from the Turkish coast throughout the year.

Landfall in Europe: The migrants on BlueSkyM as they arrive in Italy
Fredrico Soda, an Italian-based official of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), says that smugglers are making ‘a lot of money' which allows them to buy more ships to continue their trafficking. The large ‘mother' ships wait offshore in international waters to receive the illegal passengers who are ferried out in powerful rubber dinghies.
It is a lucrative trade. Smugglers charged each migrant on the BlueSkyM up to £6,000 a head. There is never a shortage of takers and they make huge sums from each voyage.
‘The predictability of thousands fleeing Syria every month allows smugglers to plan for a reliable stream of customers and to set their own price,' says Joel Millman, a spokesman for the IOM. In the first 11 months of 2014, Italian authorities rescued 163,368 people from trafficking vessels — about three times the total in 2013.
Syrians were the biggest contingent — nearly 40,000 of them by the end of November. The next highest number were Eritreans: 34,000 fleeing poverty and a despotic president for a new life in Europe.
Days after the BlueSkyM reached the Italian coast, a second ship (a one-time cattle freighter called The Ezzadeen) was towed ashore after its crew of traffickers fled in a lifeboat, leaving 359 Syrians, including 62 children, drifting off the southern Italian port of Corigliano.
The exodus seems endless, and European governments are finding it impossible to control the huge numbers. I went to the Italian-French border town of Ventimiglia and saw migrants from the BlueSkyM arriving on trains from immigration holding centres all over Italy.

Italian police, smoking and chatting to each other, watched but did not intervene as the migrants bought train tickets to Nice.
At the station, a local Algerian trafficker nicknamed ‘The Hat' (because of his penchant for leather caps) did a brisk trade offering them an alternative route: lifts in his car, parked across the road, for £60 each.
Once the trains arrive in Menton, it is the job of French police to deal with the migrants and, as EU rules dictate, send them back by bus to Italy. Many, however, hid in locked lavatories or upstairs compartments of the double-decker carriages, which police have little time to search during the train's short stop.
Mohammed crossed the Italian-French border on a train posing as a local businessman, after buying smart new clothes and a copy of that day's Italian newspaper, which he pretended to be engrossed in. The police officers did not give him a glance they walked through the carriage where he was sitting.
At Nice's main station, he and other Syrian migrants managed to elude the police again as they bought tickets for the high-speed train to Paris. Nearby, officers from France's Police Nationale stood by and did nothing.
Having reached Paris, Mohammed caught the first train the following day to Calais.
In Calais this week, a new centre opened (pictured), financed by the EU, offering three-course meals cooked by a top French chef for illegal migrants waiting to sneak into Britain
I was able to monitor Mohammed's journey because his name and mobile number were given to me by four fellow Syrians who had travelled with him on the BlueSkyM. They told me that he planned to go to England.
At Nice station, the four young men (a civil engineer, a doctor, a computer analyst and a university student, who all had a good command of English) gave me the first full accounts of the nightmare voyage.
Drawing maps, they said they had travelled from Syria to Turkey to be taken by traffickers to the BlueSkyM, which was moored about 50 miles off the coast.
Groups of migrants were then ferried in inflatable boats from the southern Turkey ports of Mersin, Tarsus, Adana and Ayas.
‘Waves broke over the inflatables, and some people fell into the water as they climbed onto the ship and had to be rescued by other migrants,' said 23-year-old Mahmoud Hassan, who is from the city of Aleppo, the fiercest battleground of the Syrian conflict.
‘The traffickers had lied and lied to us. When they took our money, they told us that it would be a “five-star trip”.'
The civil engineer, whose father owned a refrigerator factory but is now retired, left Syria because he was ordered to join President Assad's army to fight ISIS.
He explained that the BlueSkyM set off in calm waters, but the weather got stormy as it struck out towards Greece and Italy.

‘The high waves sent water into the hold, where we were lying on a metal floor. ‘The children were crying and the women were scared. Even the bravest of men prayed to be saved.
‘The captain did not come down to us. He remained in cabins by the bridge. There were 700 of us, with just one toilet for the men, women and children. It was filthy. We were afraid we would catch infections.
‘For the last three days, there was drinking water only for the children.'
After their rescue by the Italian authorities, the boat's Syrian captain was arrested, though he had tried to hide among the migrants because he wanted to begin a new life in Europe, too. It turned out he had been paid £8,000 by the traffickers to navigate the ship.
In Gallipoli, Mahmoud was taken from the quayside by officials and put on a bus to Potenza, where there is an immigration holding centre. Officials then began to fingerprint every migrant — as is required by EU laws, so that they can be traced.
Mahmoud says he was among a group of men who refused to have their prints taken, and the police ‘hit us and shouted that we had to respect their law. I was not allowed a lawyer.
‘The police banged my head on the desk and then forced my hands forward for the fingerprints.'
He says he ran away and caught the train to Ventimiglia. He intends to go to Holland, which is where his brother lives.
As for Mohammed, he was driven from Gallipoli to a migrant centre in Como, Northern Italy. But he, too, walked out and caught a train to Milan.
On his first attempt to cross from Italy to France, he was stopped at dawn by French border police on a Milan-Paris night train for not having a valid visa, and then escorted by police on a free ticket back to Milan.

There, he paid for a room in a hotel where he could rest, before setting off to the border again the next day. This time he went by train to Ventimiglia. From there, he had no trouble getting another train to Nice; and then to Paris and Calais.
Mohammed says he had a well-paid job at the Ministry of Islamic Affairs in Kuwait but gave it up after he was called up to serve in the Syrian Army.
He says he was threatened with fines — or even jail — if he did not return to Syria.
Scared, he flew to the Turkish capital, Istanbul, in early December, where he met up with people-traffickers who had put an advert on Facebook in Arabic saying that places were being sold for would-be migrants wanting to go to Europe.
Having struck a deal, he flew to Turkey's south coast, where the gang put him in a hotel with a swimming pool near Mersin. They then took him by bus to join 300 other Syrians in an empty fish processing plant, where they waited three weeks for the ship to leave.
While there, he was instructed to go to a small office in Mersin to pay £3,200 for a place on the illegal voyage. Mohammed was given a receipt and a code number 12748, which the gang promised would entitle his family to a refund if the ship sank and he drowned.
Just before Christmas, they were told it was the night to sail.
‘They put us in a mini-van. There were 23 of us, all on top of each other. We were driven to a farm by a river and put on a rubber boat to go out to international waters where the ship was moored.'
He said he was terrified because the waves were dangerously big.
Here some of the migrants are pictured being directed to a tent to receive the hot food
‘The water came up to our thighs — we thought that was it. It was dark and we had no life-jackets. A doctor near me was crying. I think he'd lost his mind with fear.'
It was not the only time the migrants thought they were going to die. ‘Water poured into the ship when the storms started. Even those who never pray, prayed to live,' Mohammed recalls.
His 25-year-old wife Rana and their two children, Aesha, three, and Omar, 19 months, remain in Kuwait in the family's modern air-conditioned flat, waiting for him to reach England, where they hope to join him.
He had phoned them to say he has reached Calais, but spared them details of his harrowing seven days at sea. He is staying in a small hotel paid for with money sent via Western Union by his family.
After such an ordeal, it would be understandable if Mohammed never wanted to deal with a people-smuggling gang again — yet he is preparing to pay another trafficker in Calais for a place on a lorry travelling to England.
He says: ‘I have been told to find an Armenian here who gets migrants across the Channel with the help of truck-drivers who are part of his gang.'
The Power of Language
Chen Hui Jing Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 21, 2015
I was never the type to keep a journal. My thoughts and ideas often stayed just that, fleeting and ephemeral, never materialising into something more. But when I became a web developer, I came across countless articles that touted the benefits of writing and blogging, both as a means of sharing knowledge with others, as well as an avenue to “get your name out there”. It's about a month and a half since I started this little personal project, and I realise that I rather enjoy writing. I may not have interesting things to write about everyday, but the more I write, the easier it gets to articulate those ethereal wisps of ideas into something tangible.
Writing forces you to structure your thoughts into coherent sentences. For someone like me, who has the attention span of a hyperactive five-year-old and a mind that runs at a million miles per hour, I often find that my thoughts form much faster than I can express them. I used to tell my friends that I wish there was some way to transmit my thoughts to their brains telepathically all at once, thus saving me the effort of trying to convey them one at a time.
I feel that one of the key factors that allowed human beings, as a species, to take over the world, was our ability to communicate complex ideas to one another using language. I find it fascinating that we managed to develop this mechanism of communication, hence my great interest in anthropology. But that's another topic for another discussion. My point is, the ability to articulate one's thoughts and ideas clearly is a very powerful skill to have.
You could have the most innovative game-changing idea of the 21st century, but if you are unable to explain it to the people around you, odds are this idea is not going to come to fruition. Often, it is not the greatest ideas that get implemented, but those which are best explained and understood. I have been lucky enough to have grown up in a family that encouraged reading. I was taught to read at an early age, and there were always plenty of books around the house. I have an older sister, whom I consider linguistically gifted, and writes really well. Growing up in such an environment probably did help me develop a certain level of eloquence, not to mention a decent-sized vocabulary.
Having mastery in a language not only helps you articulate your thoughts well, it also helps you understand others better. The human brain is great at filling in the gaps, provided you have sufficient context to work with. In this case, being fluent in a particular language. A native speaker would find it easier to understand somebody with a thick accent as opposed to someone who just picked up the language three months ago. It doesn't matter what line of work you're in, you will get ahead much faster if you can speak and write well.
With all the recent hoopla about the importance of learning to code and granting programming language credits, I still feel that the most important skill we can teach in school is the ability to communicate your thoughts in words. Knowledge can only be shared if it can be understood by others. The sharing of knowledge is what enabled human beings to take over the entire planet. Don't underestimate the power of words. Language is what makes us uniquely human.
The US terror scare
21 December 2015
In a commentary published December 17 in the Washington Post, columnist David Ignatius, who has close connections with the US military-intelligence apparatus, comments on the debate within US ruling circles about the scale and timing of an escalation of the US military intervention in Iraq and Syria.
After noting that President Obama has so far rejected calls to deploy substantial numbers of US ground troops against ISIS, Ignatius poses this revealing question:
“What would cause Obama to change his mind and treat the war against the Islamic State as an existential crisis requiring a major US military intervention? Probably the trigger would be a big, orchestrated terrorist incident that so frightened the public that it began to prevent the normal functioning of America. At that point, Obama might decide there was no alternative to taking ownership of the Middle East mess with tens of thousands of US troops.”
This observation explains far more about the political significance of the November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris and the December 2 killings in San Bernardino than the feverish denunciations of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (ISIS) by American politicians and the corporate-controlled media.
The US ruling elite is mulling over its options in Iraq and Syria, well aware of the powerful domestic opposition to the expanding war in the Middle East. Wall Street, the Pentagon and the CIA know that to embark on a major escalation, including the use of large numbers of ground troops, they will need a suitable pretext to overcome popular anti-war sentiment. The media firestorm following San Bernardino has served as something of a dress rehearsal for how this would be done.
Terrible and tragic as it was, the killing of 14 people in San Bernardino was only one of dozens of such mass shootings in the United States over the past few years, and only the second—following the Ft. Hood, Texas killings by Major Nidal Hassan in 2009—in which the attackers were apparently motivated by Islamic extremism. In the period since the 9/11 attacks, white supremacist and Christian fundamentalist terrorists have killed more people in America than Islamists, yet there is no political or media firestorm demanding state repression of such right-wing fanatics.
San Bernardino has been seized upon to roll out a political agenda prepared well in advance, with demands for the elimination of encryption in Internet services, mass surveillance of all social media postings, a crackdown on visa waivers and a dramatic escalation of US military operations in the name of a war against ISIS. This despite the fact that the two killers, husband and wife, did not prepare their attack using encrypted communications, did not (contrary to press claims) announce their terrorist intentions on social media, did not make use of the visa waiver program, and had no direct connection to ISIS at all. Syed Farook was apparently radicalized before ISIS had even taken its present shape as an organization.
This is a recurring pattern over the past 15 years, going back to the murky origins of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, which have never been the subject of a serious and independent investigation. Terrorist attacks take place that are attributed to shadowy Islamist organizations that have longstanding ties to the CIA and other imperialist intelligence agencies. (Al Qaeda, for example, arose out of the US-backed guerrilla war against the pro-Soviet regime in Afghanistan in the 1980s.)
These attacks become the pretext for the launching of predatory wars long planned by the imperialist powers and needing only a suitable pretext. Thus 9/11 became the launching pad for the US invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The Paris attacks have brought a French aircraft carrier into the bombing campaign in Syria along with the participation of British bombers and a substantial troop deployment by Germany.
War abroad is inevitably accompanied by repression at home, with police-military mobilizations that are carried out in the name of fighting “terrorism,” but whose real purpose is to suppress domestic anti-war sentiment and working class opposition to the austerity measures required by the deepening crisis of world capitalism. Thus the Paris attacks were followed by a savage crackdown by the French government, whose first victims were environmental protesters outside the climate summit earlier this month.
According to Ignatius, who participated in a closed-door briefing at the White House with a group of editors and columnists on December 15, the Obama administration does not view San Bernardino as providing a sufficient casus belli for a full-scale US war in Syria. Something bigger would be required.
This should be taken as a warning. There are many in the vast US intelligence apparatus with the experience and ruthlessness required to manufacture such an incident, either by permitting an ongoing terrorist plan to go forward without disruption—as was apparently the case in the 9/11 attack—or by directly organizing such an operation under a false flag. At the very least, they consider events such as the Paris and San Bernardino attacks as a political godsend.
It is instructive to recall the words of former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, who played a key role in the Carter administration's anti-Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, in his book on US imperialist foreign policy, The Grand Chessboard, published just four years before 9/11:
It is also a fact that America is too democratic at home to be autocratic abroad. This limits the use of America's power, especially its capacity for military intimidation. Never before has a populist democracy attained international supremacy. But the pursuit of power is not a goal that commands popular passion, except in conditions of a sudden threat or challenge to the public's sense of domestic well-being [emphasis added]. The economic self-denial (that is, defense spending) and the human sacrifice (casualties, even among professional soldiers) required in the effort are uncongenial to democratic instincts. Democracy is inimical to imperial mobilization.
When such an event occurs, the faster the media reaches unanimity on what organization was responsible and what country must be bombed or invaded to “defend” the American people, the more certain it is that a long-prepared contingency plan is coming to fruition.
This reality underscores the completely manipulated and stage-managed character of the 2016 presidential election. An event such as San Bernardino can be dropped on the US public like a bomb at any time for the purpose of provoking a war, tipping an election or even calling off voting altogether. It is worth remembering that in 2004 there was open discussion within the Bush administration of the possible postponement or cancellation of the presidential election, using a possible terrorist attack as the pretext. (See: “Bush admnistration takes steps to cancel US election”)
Last week's debates by the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates displayed bipartisan agreement on the essential political rationale for a new imperialist war in the Middle East. All the capitalist politicians, from the pseudo-socialist Bernie Sanders to the libertarian Rand Paul, adhered to the media narrative that the San Bernardino killings are the central issue in the election, that the American people are completely preoccupied with the danger of terrorism, and that every action of the US government, foreign and domestic, must be judged through this lens.
The Socialist Equality Party entirely rejects this political framework. We call on workers not to be deceived or swayed by the barrage of pro-war propaganda disguised as anti-terrorism. We fight for the independent political mobilization of the working class against imperialist war, against mounting state repression, and against austerity policies and the destruction of jobs and living standards and advance a socialist and internationalist program to guide this struggle.

Some players got some new homes Thursday morning. The only thing left to determine is how permanent the moves will be.
Nine players were selected in Thursday's Rule 5 Draft, highlighted by first overall pick and left-handed pitcher Patrick Schuster.
Schuster, who had been part of the D-backs organization entering the day, was picked by the Astros in the Draft but is being moved to the Padres to complete Wednesday's trade that sent reliever Anthony Bass to Houston. The southpaw posted a 1.83 ERA with 45 strikeouts and 18 walks in 44 1/3 innings at Class A Advanced Visalia last season. It was the 23-year-old's second season in the California League.
Schuster made a name for himself at J.W. Mitchell (New Port Richey, Fla.) High School where he threw four straight no-hitters in 2009. The D-backs took him in the 13th round that year.
Adrian Nieto was the second choice of the Draft, moving from the Nationals to the White Sox. The 24-year-old Cuban catcher slashed .285/.373/.449 with 11 homers and 53 RBIs in 110 games for Class A Advanced Potomac last season. He also batted .271/.345/.333 in a 13-game stint in the Arizona Fall League.
Kevin Munson (Phillies), Tommy Kahnle (Rockies), Brian Moran (Blue Jays), Seth Rosin (Mets), Wei-Chung Wang (Brewers), Marcos Mateo (D-backs) and Michael Almanzar (Orioles) rounded out the other nine selections in the Major League portion of the Draft. Moran and Rosin were both traded to the Angels and Dodgers, respectively, following their selections.
Those players picked in the Major League portion of the Rule 5 Draft must stick on his new team's 25-man roster for the entirety of the 2014 regular season, lest they be returned to their previous organization.
Thirty-four selections were made in the Triple-A portion and just two were picked in the Double-A section. The biggest name in the later rounds doesn't even play baseball anymore. Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was taken in the Triple-A round by the Rangers. Wilson last played second base in the Rockies system in 2011.
Here's a breakdown of each Rule 5 selection:
A Turkish military helicopter carrying soldiers on a mission against Kurdish rebels crashed because of bad weather on Saturday, killing all 17 troops onboard, officials said.
Thirteen soldiers and four military crewmembers were killed in the crash in a mountainous part of Pervari district in Siirt province, in south-eastern Turkey, where the rebel Kurdistan Worker's party is fighting for self-rule.
President Abdullah Gul said the soldiers were on their way "to help their friends" in an operation against the rebels who have escalated attacks in recent months, adding the incident would not deter Turkey from its determination to fight the rebels.
The provincial governor, Ahmet Aydin, blamed the crash on heavy fog and ruled out an attack by the rebel group.
"The weather during the transportation (of troops) was bad. There was extreme rain. The helicopter crashed into rocks because of the fog," Aydin said in televised statements. "The incident was the result of a crash and any kind of attack is out of the question."
The Kurdish rebels have been fighting since the 1980s and they seek more rights for Kurds, including autonomy in the mostly Kurdish south-east. Turkey and its western allies categorise the rebels, known by the acronym PKK, as a terrorist group.
On Friday, the office for the governor for the nearby province of Hakkari said as many as 42 Kurdish rebels had been killed in the past three days in operations that were backed by airpower. It made no mention of any casualties among troops.
The other day I bumped into my friend Hardy while at the offices of the Association of Residents of Costa Rica (ARCR). He invited me to have coffee in downtown San José. My friend is very bright and an incessant talker. Over the years he has managed several successful restaurant operations in the San José area. Anyway we got onto the subject of personal freedom in Costa and like many others who live here we agree that there is definitely more freedom than in North America. In most cases people just leave you alone here. Even the police are much nicer and less threatening than their U.S. and Canadian counterparts.
My Costa Rican son says that having too much freedom has its downside. People tend to take things not as seriously as they do back home and the result is that work get done a much slower pace and quality control can be lacking. Many laws are very lax and hard to enforce, so petty criminals often get away with crimes repeatedly. Traffic enforcement can also be lax at times with people getting away with very dangerous maneuvers on the highway that they would never be able to do back home.
Roger Mukasa snared 6 for 27 and scored a brisk half-century as well to carry Uganda's hopes, but Nepal smothered the rest of the line-up to record their sixth win in seven matches to claim the World Cricket League Division Three crown.
Sagar Pun and Naresh Budayair recorded the sixth century partnership of the tournament to kick Nepal off after they had elected to bat. The openers cruised past their respective fifties and Gyanendra Malla joined them as well with a fluent 56 off 65 balls. However, the batting fell away after that. Seamer Mukasa ran through the middle and lower order to collect six wickets in 3.5 overs to make him the second-top wicket-taker.
The high of keeping Nepal to 223 after they were 131 for 1 was tempered when Mukasa had to retire hurt in the eighth over for 12. Uganda continued sedately, but spin put the skids on them. Basant Regmi and Shakti Gauchan combined for 18.1 overs to yield only 61 runs and took three wickets in the space of 10 balls. The run-rate had tipped over six when Mukasa returned and ignited hopes of a fightback. He finished with 51 off 52 balls to be second-top run-scorer as well, but the rest could not muster much. Their last five wickets were wrapped up for 20 runs with left-arm spinner Bhuvan Karki picking up 4 for 39.
USA ended their disappointing campaign in Kuala Lumpur by beating Bermuda by ten wickets in a low-scoring game.
Bermuda collapsed after choosing to bat, scoring briskly and losing wickets in a stream as they did so, and were dismissed for 113 in 19.3 overs. Only four batsmen made it into double figures and Jordan de Silva top scored with 39 at No. 8. Usman Shuja and Adil Bhatti took three wickets each for the USA.
Bhatti and his opening partner Fahad Babar then made short work of the target of 114. Bhatti made 52 off 43 balls and Babar made 63 off 49 deliveries as USA's victory was achieved with 208 balls to spare.
A century from Suhan Alagaratnam helped the hosts Malaysia to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory against Singapore in Selangor. Alagaratnam struck 12 fours and four sixes during his 96-ball 101, and added 110 for the second wicket with the captain Ahmed Faiz (46), as Malaysia gunned down their 170-run target in 32.3 overs.
Singapore, having been inserted, were bundled out for 169 in 48 overs. Christopher Janik top-scored with 63 and Singapore were well-placed at 119 for 3, but the dismissal of Rezza Gaznavi for 22 in the 38th over triggered a slide that saw the team lose their last seven wickets for just 50 runs.
Pavandeep Singh was the pick of Malaysia's bowlers, taking 3 for 43, while Nasir Shafiq and Shahrulnizam Yusof snared two wickets apiece.

MORGAN HILL — A preschool teacher faces jail time after pleading no contest to misdemeanor charges stemming from dosing the sippy cups of her young charges with sleeping pills.
Deborah Gratz, a 59-year-old Hollister resident, entered the pleas this week on five counts of attempted child endangerment, according to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's Department.
“This is a case about betrayal,” said prosecutor Sumerle Davis. “Ms. Gratz betrayed the parents and the trust of these innocent children who look up to their teachers for every need, from their ABCs to quenching their thirst.”
Gratz had worked at the Kiddie Academy in Morgan Hill since 2007, employed as the “lead toddler teacher” in the mornings. She watched over about 10 children ages 1ï»¿ and 2.
A co-worker saw her putting something into the cups and, upon inspection, staff members found residue in five of the vessels. It happened early in the morning as teachers prepared for the day, and the cups were confiscated before any kids used them.
Gratz was fired the same day, although the school came under fire from parents and was criticized by police for not notifying authorities immediately. She was arrested March 11, a Monday three days after the incident occurred.
Sumerle said Gratz admitted to police that she dosed the cups with crushed Sominex, a sleep aid that is also used for allergies, cold relief and motion sickness. Sominex labeling advises it not be used for children under 12.
Sumerle said Gratz told police that she did it so the kids would sleep longer during naptimes.
Gratz had originally faced an additional five counts of assault when she was charged in March and, at that time, prosecutors said she could face more than two years in jail if the sentences ran consecutively. However, that was considered unlikely. Gratz is scheduled to be sentenced July 5.

Blount County woman claims in suit police brutality, malfunction of body cam Copyright by WATE - All rights reserved Video
WATE 6 On Your Side Staff - ALCOA (WATE) - A Blount County woman has filed a civil rights suit in federal court against the city of Alcoa, its police chief and other officers, Blount County, its sheriff, and several people at the Blount County Jail saying an officer struck her in the knee with such force it fractured her kneecap and tore ligaments.
Annissa Colson, whom the lawsuit states suffers from multiple anxiety disorders, was arrested on June 23 by Alcoa Officer Dustin Cook on a DUI charge. The suit states she was involved in a single-vehicle accident and refused a field sobriety test, but agreed to a blood alcohol test.
When she and Officer Cook arrived at Blount Memorial Hospital, the suit says Colson changed her mind and began suffering a "crippling panic attack, gasping for breath, in obvious distress." The suit says despite being only a few feet from the emergency room, the officer did not take her inside to seek help but instead forced her back inside the patrol car. That's when the suit says Cook and another officer, Arik Wilson, became violent.
"At one point, Wilson violently struck [Colson's] right knee with his own knee and a loud 'pop' was heard and recorded by Cook's body-worn camera," reads the suit. The suit says Wilson became concerned about Colson's injury due to the fact she was screaming in pain, but they continued to physically force her in to the patrol car using pressure point tactics. Cook contacted his supervisor to ask if they should have Colson's knee examined, but the supervisor said to take her to the jail.
When they got to the jail, the suit says Colson was strapped into a chair, forced to wear a helmet and not allowed to drink water or use the bathroom, forcing her to urinate on herself, at which onlooking officers laughed. The suit says a jail nurse examined her knee, but said there was nothing wrong with it.
Eventually after she was released from jail and went to the hospital, a doctor initially thought she was the victim of domestic abuse and found she was suffering from a kneecap fracture, torn ACL and torn LCL, along with buses, contusions and abrasions to various parts of her body. Colson says she continues to suffer from the injuries and is having to see a physical therapist. She also says her TennCare coverage will not cover treatment for her injuries.
The lawsuit notes that while Wilson was wearing a body camera, it malfunctioned and did not record the events at the hospital or jail. The suit says Cook's camera was rolling during most of the incidents and captured audio of Colson's knee popping, but his was also disabled for several minutes at the jail. The officers claimed she was constantly fighting them and at one point kicked one of the officers.
Colson and her attorney, Lance K. Baker, are seeking $2 million from the various parties named in the suit.
EXCLUSIVE: Fox has set Carter Blanchard to do a new draft of the Independence Day sequel that Roland Emmerich has committed to direct for a July 1, 2016, release. The first draft was done by Emmerich and Dean Devlin, and then James Vanderbilt. Emmerich is producing with Devlin and Harald Kloser. Emmerich is prepping the film as he simultaneously shoots Stonewall, a drama about the seminal Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village that sparked the gay rights movement. Jeremy Irvine stars.
The scribe is currently adapting Mark Millar's Kindergarten Heroes for Fox and producer Simon Kinberg, and he just finished a draft of Spyhunter for Ruben Fleischer to direct at Warners. He's best known for selling the spec Glimmer to DreamWorks and getting a personal call from Steven Spielberg that sealed the deal. Blanchard is repped by Paradigm and Madhouse.
A look at what's happening around the New York Jets:
1. Lucky 13: One of the themes that has emerged from Mike Maccagnan's first two drafts is that he prefers intelligent football players with no off-the-field issues. He has picked a total of 13 players, and not one has a known red flag in his background -- unusual in the current NFL. This is the right approach for a new regime. Once you've established a locker-room culture, it becomes easier to gamble on a character risk. For now, it makes sense to fill the room with solid citizens -- and smart players.
Most of the current draft class posted above-average scores on the Wonderlic intelligence test (max grade: 50). In fact, Jordan Jenkins (33) and Darron Lee (31) were among the highest for linebackers. (Joe Schobert, drafted by the Cleveland Browns, led with a 36.) I spoke to scouts from two different teams, and they both described Jenkins and Lee as quality individuals. Lee is mature and polished, which came through in his first news conference at the Jets' facility. Jenkins is "a classy kid," one NFC scout told me.
Cornerback Juston Burris (27) and punter Lachlan Edwards (30) also scored high for their respective positions. Quarterback Christian Hackenberg (24) and wide receiver Charone Peake (18) were average, and tackle Brandon Shell (17) was below average, based on their positions.
2. Exception to the rule: By now, you probably know the Jets tried to trade up for Laremy Tunsil, the tackle who fell to 13th because of the bong-smoking video that surfaced as the draft started. Clearly, Maccagnan was willing to deviate from his goody-two-shoes philosophy for Tunsil, who was rated as one of the top players on the Jets' draft board. A double standard? Here's how I see it: Maccagnan was so confident in his prep work on Tunsil that, unlike some GMs, he didn't freak out upon seeing the video. I know of one team in the top 12 that did an about-face on Tunsil as soon as the video made it to their draft room.
Let's be honest, though: Maccagnan didn't try to trade up for Tunsil as much as he tried to steal him. He thought he smelled a fire sale. He offered the New York Giants, picking 10th, a second-round pick to swap places in the first round, according to the New York Daily News. That was a Ryan Fitzpatrick-type of offer, meaning below the market price, based on the draft-trade chart used by teams. He called other teams, too, finding no takers.
3. Always thinking big: Another two-year trend has developed with Maccagnan's drafting: He's not a small-school kind of GM, as 11 of the 13 picks came from the Power 5 conferences. The only exceptions were seventh-round picks: Nose tackle Deon Simon (Northwestern State, 2015) and Edwards (Sam Houston State, 2016).
4. Attack on Hack: Wow, the analytics people are really down on Hackenberg. Football Outsiders, which cooked up a formula that uses college stats to project NFL performance, essentially says Hackenberg will be a bust. It has a ranking system called QBASE (Quarterback Adjusted Stats and Experience), and no quarterback in QBASE's database (top-100 picks since 1996) has succeeded in the NFL with college stats similar to those of Hackenberg. Other top-100 picks who completed under 55 percent in the final college season were Brock Huard, Dave Ragone, Kyle Boller, Marques Tuiasosopo and Quincy Carter -- all flops.
Like I said during the draft, I think the Jets reached for Hackenberg in the second round, but they looked past the numbers, relying on their scouting instincts. Time will tell if they're right. If Hackenberg succeeds, he will be a statistical anomaly.

5. Hack vs. Geno vs. Bryce: In their seemingly endless search for a franchise quarterback, the Jets have accumulated three high-profile former college passers. I asked ESPN draft analyst Todd McShay to compare Hackenberg, Geno Smith and Bryce Petty, based on their draft grades.
"I think [Petty] has a lower ceiling than Hackenberg," McShay said. "Ultimately, Hackenberg, from a pro-style system and his skill set, has the greatest upside of that group. But he's the furthest away in terms of accuracy of those three."
McShay said Petty "had the best leadership and football character of all those guys," which I found interesting. Basically, the Jets have three players with different strengths and different weaknesses, and they have to hope one of them has enough good stuff to develop.
6. Fitz-Hackenberg connections: If Fitzpatrick and Hackenberg end up in the same quarterback room, they will have two common denominators -- Bill O'Brien and Jordan Palmer.
Both quarterbacks played for O'Brien, Hackenberg in 2013 (Penn State), Fitzpatrick in 2014 (Houston Texans). Fitzpatrick told me last season he learned more in one year under O'Brien than under any of his previous coaches. Fitzpatrick is close friends with former Cincinnati Bengals teammate Carson Palmer, the older brother of Jordan Palmer, Hackenberg's personal QB coach during the pre-draft process.
Small world, right?
7. Looking for a hybrid: Maccagnan said in a radio interview the Jets looked into signing safety-turned-linebacker Mark Barron as a free agent. That should've been an indication they were in the market for a big safety/small linebacker, and they found it with Lee. Barron ended up re-signing with the Los Angeles Rams.
8. Fountain of Youth: Maccagnan made it a point of mentioning that Lee and Hackenberg are relatively young for incoming rookies. He's right. Of the 31 players drafted by AFC East teams, Hackenberg (21 years, 91 days) and Lee (21 years, 200 days) are the second- and third-youngest. The youngest is Miami Dolphins tight end Thomas Duarte (21 years, 38 days). What does it mean? I'm not sure. All I know is, Hackenberg and Duarte were born when I was covering the Rich Kotite Jets, and that's rather scary.
9. Keeping the light on: Todd Bowles said he hasn't shut the door in re-signing linebacker Calvin Pace and/or cornerback Antonio Cromartie. Right now they have a greater need for Pace because of the inexperience at outside linebacker. The smart play: Evaluate the kids through the June minicamp, and perhaps into the early of portion of training camp. If they're struggling, summon the graybeard from the bullpen.
10. The last rookie camp? Bowles admitted he considered the possibility of cancelling on-field drills in favor of classroom work, a growing trend around the league. He decided to stick to a traditional minicamp because of Hackenberg.
"If we didn't draft a quarterback, I wasn't going to have one, either," he said, adding that rookie quarterbacks need the mental reps on the field.

A mansion owned by Ted Hayman, one of the most notorious kingpins in Bluefields, Nicaragua. After his arrest last year, some people took to the streets to protest.
Some names in this story have been changed for the safety of those involved.
Bluefields, the largest port on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast, is in many ways a typical small coastal Central American city—bustling but poor, a natural center for all kinds of commerce, legal and illegal. If you hang out by the bay you'll see cargo ships come in and passenger boats ferry people to and from the surrounding towns, some of which aren't reachable by overland routes. By day, the streets are filled with garishly decorated taxis, starving stray dogs, and people selling mangos and pineapples. At night, a few downtown bars stay open late to serve beer and play reggae, bachata, and country music.
The majority of the men who aren't cops or store owners work on boats, while women often turn their living rooms into sit-down restaurants or sell grilled meat and tortillas outside their homes. There aren't many more options for the mostly black and indigenous population of 90,000—there's no highway connecting Bluefields with the wealthier western part of the country, and without infrastructure there's little prospect of outside investment.
Just about the only industry that's pumped outside money into the local economy is drug trafficking.
When Bluefields and the surrounding South Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS) was a hub for cocaine smugglers shipping loads north from Colombia, most of the profits were pocketed by kingpins, and violence and homicides increased—but some cash did trickle down to the locals. And every little bit helps here in the poorest region of second-poorest country in Western hemisphere.
That status quo is changing, however. In the last few years, Nicargua has received millions in aid from both Russian and the US in order to drive the narcos away. At this point, of course, no one has any illusions about “winning” the war on drugs. The plan is to just try to get traffickers to change routes. As a result, many smugglers have either moved inland or started using Nicaragua's North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) as a waystation instead. With the traffickers gone, many RAAS residents have lost a much-needed source of income, and so far nothing has replaced it.
One way drug money benefited Bluefields residents was through kingpins like Ted Hayman, who until his arrest in 2012 provided logistical support for cartels smuggling drugs from the RAAS up to the Honduran border. His employees refueled boats and guided traffickers through unfamiliar terrain. He also ran a sort of intelligence operation by paying fishermen to keep track of where the Nicaraguan Navy or the US Coast Guard were located. On top of all that, he operated a substantial domestic drug-selling operation that was big enough to require cover businesses, including the Hooters Hotel in Managua, Nicaragua's capital.
At the height of his career, Hayman built a $1 million mansion in poverty-ridden Bluefields and another lavish house in his poorer hometown of Tasbapounie that overlooked tin-roofed shacks. These were grotesque symbols of inequality, but they also provided valuable construction jobs, which are hard to come by since not many residents have money to build anything.
Money also flowed into smaller communities such as Tasbapounie and Pearl Lagoon when Hayman threw lavish parties. Bluefields resident Aracely Thompson told me Hayman would pay all the shopkeepers a lump sum so that whoever came in could get whatever they wanted, including meats, rice, and booze. People would come from hours away just to partake in the festivities and get a few necessities. Thompson even admitted to going once or twice.
“The parties were great times,” she said. “If we heard it was going to happen, we would go.”
Hayman also used his wealth to buy off the local community council board and appointed people he wanted in charge, which is a typical tactic used by big-time traffickers in impoverished areas. Money talks, and in extremely poor places it talks very, very loud. His power meant he could do things like quickly grant fishing licenses, which was normally a costly bureaucratic process. Thompson said he also occasionally gave away new boat engines.
Naturally, this type of casual, widespread bribery made Hayman incredibly popular. When he was arrested in June, 2012, people protested in the streets. I asked a taxi driver what he thought about Hayman, and the driver smiled and said, “He's a good guy! Too bad they got him.”
Another Bluefields kingpin, Frank Zeledon, who people believe is more powerful and more connected to national politicians, wasn't touched during the series of arrests that took Hayman down. In fact, the last police captain who tried to have him arrested was promptly moved to another part of the country. That the police arrested one kingpin but not the more powerful one eroded what little trust people have for cops in the city.
Men stand guard at a gas station near Bluefields, Nicaragua. Buying barrels of gas and using it to refuel smugglers' boats is a common way to make money.
Monkey Point is a tiny seaside village of about 280 people located 32 miles south of Bluefields. It's nearly impossible to get to without a boat, and drug traffickers on their way from Colombia have been using it as a refueling station for some time, which has created an entire microindustry.
When I visited, gasoline in Bluefields, the closest town with gas stations, was $6 per gallon, and you can't buy more than one barrel of gas without providing a photo ID, a measure the government adopted to combat drug trafficking. Those who make money by providing fuel to drug runners at Monkey Point get around this by simply using multiple people to buy barrels one at a time, which are then taken down the river to the remote rendezvous.
According to Jack Carter, a resident of Monkey Point, traffickers pay between $2,000 and $3,000 per boat for this service, and after subtracting the cost of the barrels and the gas used to transport them, the refueling crews generally get around just $200 apiece per boat. “The people aren't making big money off this thing,” Carter told me. “But it's something, you know?”
He explained that people in Monkey Point live primarily off of small-scale subsistence fishing and farming, which doesn't bring in much cash, if any. Money made from refueling can be used to buy needed supplies, gas, clothes, rice, flour, and materials for boat maintenance, which is extremely important in an area with no roads. There are several refueling spots along the coast and the traffickers generally switch between them to evade authorities (they use Monkey Point less often than they used to) but despite the infrequency, difficulty, and illegal nature of the work, people still flock to it. They're that hard up for cash.
“The people don't like doing it. They don't want to do it,” Carter said. “But there are no roads, there are no jobs, all the people can do is fish and plant. So they gotta take what they can.”
The beneficial economic effects of the drug trade for the communities along the coast were sporadic and unreliable—maybe you'd find a couple of kilos of coke on the beach, maybe Hayman would tip you lavishly for a service—but they were real. “You used to see people placing big bets for the baseball game,” Thompson said. “You [used to] see some more people buying things like stoves. But now, no. No more of that.”
The problem is not that the war on drugs has taken money out of Bluefields and the surrounding area, it's that nothing has emerged to replace that money. The US donates about $3.5 million a year in military and police aid to Nicaragua, in addition to gifts like new boats for the navy and parachutes for the army. Russia is providing aid money on top of that—perhaps, analysts have speculated, in order to increase arms sales and undermine US influence in Latin America.
But none of that money ever ends up in the the hands of anyone in Bluefields.
Nicaragua doesn't seem to care about building more infrastructure to attract investment on the Caribbean coast—residents I spoke to talked at great length about their plans to persuade officials to put an industrial fishery here to create a more dependable economy, but the government is notorious for ignoring the region's mostly black and indigenous population; if the fishery does happen, it will be an exception to the rule. Meanwhile, a controversial canal to rival Panama's has received a lot of press, but many doubts it will ever be built, and local indigenous leaders say it will do more harm than good.
Charles Bell, a social activist from Bluefields, strongly believes that the government exploits and ignores blacks and indigenous people. But he also feels that the big-time traffickers have played the same game—they make a lot of money from smuggling drugs using local labor, but they have no interest in fixing the problems plaguing coastal communities.
“The people stay poor no matter what,” said Bell. “[Cartels] don't do anything for the people, they just give them free stuff once in a while.”
As an example, he pointed to Little Corn Island, a popular tourist spot located a few miles off the coast that is rumored to be a sort of money laundering haven for drug traffickers. “They have beautiful hotels there. Everyone has a nice house, too,” he said. “But look at the school: nothing.” At the same time, he admits that some money is better than no money.
“People need something. What else are they gonna do?” he said.
Bell's attitude of reluctant acceptance of the economic benefits of drug trafficking was shared by many people I spoke with. Nobody really likes the drug trade, of course. It generates misery, addiction, and violence, and getting involved with it could land you in prison or on the bad side of the cartels. But because the governments of both Nicaragua and the US have chosen to spend millions on fighting the war on drugs rather than building roads and other improvements in a region that sorely needs infrastructure, residents have few options. Drug traffickers aren't the good guys in Bluefields, but the sad reality is that they're often the only ones seeing to people's immediate needs.

The snark firestorm that exploded after a dehydrated Marco Rubio ran a duck-and-cover water-grabbing operation in the middle of his State of the Union rebuttal turned the senator's big debut into a big blah. Republican savior? Not quite—the wet whistler became the latest in an eminent line of has-beens who saw their stars flicker and fade as a direct result of giving a lackluster rebuttal. Or so we heard from the Internet, which saw a drab speech full of stale bromides—only one flux capacitor away from the 1980s, marred by that fateful sip of water—and not much else.
However, non-conservative pundit opinions of Marco Rubio—whether progressive, centrist, or only adhering to the ideology of clicks—are as easy to predict as the Weekly Standard's views on the president's marquee policy speech. On the other end of the spectrum, it doesn't matter that Rubio's speech was void of any novel policy proposals, or that it made egregious misstatements about Obama's plans, or that dehydration left him looking more Falstaff than Prince Hal. Republicans ate it up, as is evidenced by this not-so-scientific poll on the National Review homepage.
Why is Rubio's hot-thang cachet undiminished after earning the Beltway equivalent of a single-digit Rotten Tomatoes score? Because he's the key to keeping the party's makeover from being anything but plastic surgery. He's Latino—a demographic that was once in reach for Republicans before the Party made being a Latino and conservative near mutually exclusive propositions. He's a young whippersnapper in a party of creaky old men, and yet he votes like someone who's collected Social Security for decades. As all the voices condemning the rebuttal today note, it seems like a tenuous bet to ride all your hopes on a guy who is making the same tired speeches Republicans have been making ad nauseum for years—albeit with a babycheeked, nonwhite face.
But Rubio and the Republicans think they have one trump card: Marco Rubio is a charismatic son of a gun. Except, is Rubio connecting to anyone besides the party's base? It doesn't seem likely, but don't tell the GOP. Rubio might not be a scientist, man, but that feeling Republicans get when the senator starts railing against taxes is one that will greatly prolong the lifespan of the party's little makeover scheme. It may not be until 2016 that they finally learn the majority of the country ain't buying what he's selling.
So They Say
"People say Marco Rubio is a good speaker. I see why they say it. He's warm. Polished enough. He has a nice smile. He exudes what seems like earnestness. If Arrested Development's Lucille 2 had to take a GOP presidential contender as her escort to a charity auction at the Balboa Bay Club, Rubio is the one she'd invite."

Daily Meme: The SOTU VIP Cheatsheet
Obama and Rubio are receiving the bulk of the media's post-SOTU fawning and scoffing, but the real stars of the night, in our humble opinion, were the people who earned shoutouts in Obama's address.
There was Desiline Victor, a 102-year-old Haitian immigrant who had to wait hours and hours to vote in the 2012 election, but wait she did.
"When she emerged from the North Miami Public Library with an 'I Voted' sticker, the crowd erupted in applause."
Victor, who calls Obama her son, said yesterday, “No one should have to wait in line that long. But I was going to persist because I really wanted to vote.”
Then you had Menchu De Luna Sanchez, a nurse at the NYU Langone Medical Center who helped move 20 high-risk babies when Hurricane Sandy shutdown Manhattan. She said of being able to sit in the chambers, “It's a dream of a lifetime. This is the best thing that ever happened to me."
The other people mentioned in the State of the Union all were victims of American's gun-violence epidemic, and provided a powerful and unsettling denouement to Obama's otherwise rote speech.
There was Gabby Giffords, who was recently profiled in Vogue and is staffing up a super PAC to promote gun safety.
There was Brian Murphy, the officer who was shot nine times by the Oak Creek sikh temple shooter but pushed his colleagues to continue on and stop the murderer instead of tending to his injuries.
When Obama asked how he did it, Murphy replied, “That's just the way we're made.”
And most heartbreaking was the story of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old who performed in Obama's inaugural with her high school's marching band, and was killed in a shooting in Chicago less than a week later.
Obama said of her, "she loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. She was a majorette. She was so good to her friends, they all thought they were her best friend."
Her parents sat with the First Lady, and Obama said the same adlibbed refrain he said after introducing each of the victims of gun violence—"They deserve a vote." Expect to hear that again—and again.
Hadiya's mother, Cleopatra Crowley, said of the night, "It's bittersweet, because it's as a result of losing my daughter, but it's also exciting to have an opportunity like this.”
What We're Writing
Obama made pre-kindergarten education a priority in last night's speech, and while conservatives have long decried the idea of public pre-K, Sharon Lerner demonstrates, with facts, why they're so, so wrong.
Words are hard, but pictures are easy, and the ones that move might be even better. Anne Friedman has a GIF round-up of the SOTU just for you.
What We're Reading
We heard "smarter government" a few times last night, but the real point was the rebuttal of that Reagan era Cro-Magnonism, "Government bad, markets good."
The big guy on Penn Ave. also came out in favor of a significantly increased federal minimum wage, which is a big step for the increasingly large number of people that are making it. The problem, as TNR points out, is that $9 is still less than it should be accounting for inflation, and it's way less than a living wage.
As far as foreign policy, the President's speech last night made him seem less decider and more avoider.
The math of the War on Terror has never really worked out, what with the way we kill so many more of each other than terrorists ever have. And now that the conflict is morphing into the War on American Values, Civil Liberties, and the Innocent Children of the Rest of the World, maybe it's time we took a stand against the whole business?
Jeff Madrick writes of Obama and more government spending, "We have an intelligent president who is moving in the right direction. But he is moving too slowly, hobbled by his obeisance to the deficit hawks."
You simply must read Esquire's guide to good eye contact. (Note to a certain senator: Don't keep eye contact while taking a hydration break in a nationally broadcast speech.)
Poll of the Day
Gallup came out with a poll today designed to fire up both the evangelicals that cluster in the South and the nihilistic, hedonistic, atheistic liberals that flock to the coasts. Mississippi, Utah, and Alabama are the most religious states in the union, with the rest of the antebellum beauties right behind. Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are the least God-fearing, along with most of the other tried-and-true blue states. Forty percent of Americans overall say that they're very religious, comfortably between Mississippi's 58 percent and Vermont's 19 percent.
The inevitable outcome of your decisions
Congratulations, GOP. After 25 years of failure and betrayal your base is 'ready for a revolution'
People are fed up. They're angry. They're furious. ...And you can thank the GOP for it. I've been arguing - for well over a decade now - that the party had long abandoned its constitutionalist roots. The base demanded strict-constructionists but, for a variety of reasons, it was force-fed a cadre of candidates that were about as far from that ideal as a Republican can get. While top tier GOPers derided true small-government politicians as throwbacks, Birchers, and “wacko birds,” their constituents were force fed a parade of expansionists that included Bush, Dole, Bush, McCain, Romney, and - if the party had its way - Bush again.
This week, we got confirmation of something else I've been arguing for ages - those “wackos” would probably already have this election sewn up. Meanwhile, as the GOP frittered away 25 years, liberals did what liberals are supposed to do. Democrats were treated to exactly the kinds of candidates they wanted to support. Progressives elected big government, tax & spend liberals who made sweeping promises and delivered on them - often due to the aid offered by a feckless “opposition party.” Well, congratulations, GOP. You've arrived at the inevitable outcome of your efforts. WATCH: Woman at Pence rally: “If Hillary Clinton gets in ... I'm ready for a revolution".
Pence: “Don't say that.” https://t.co/33kkes5urQ — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) October 11, 2016 I wonder if the GOP has any idea how prevalent this line of thinking is. We could spend all day discussing the fact that Trump is “not a conservative,” or “not a constitutionalist.” It's true. He's not - at least not in any traditional sense.
Trump said the “Shackles” were off, and he began attacking the elites within the Republican party. How dare they ask the base for sympathy? His ascent is a reaction. He's the Republican party's Frankenstein's monster - one they spent two and a half decades building. Now, as he turns on his creators, they throw their hands up in dismay, act like they're shocked, and beg for unity. Sorry, Republican party. YOU did this. Again and again you ignored your base, betrayed your voters, and abandoned both your principles and your promises. If (as some of you claim) Trump ends up being the death of the party, YOUR decisions will be the nails in your own coffin. Yesterday, Trump said the “Shackles” were off, and he began attacking the elites within the Republican party. How dare they ask the base for sympathy?

20 female lawmakers agreed there would have been no fiscal cliff drama had they been running the show, but they may be wrong
ABC Female senators sit down for an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer.
They're definitely “not a sorority,” as Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) insisted. And yet the 20 women lawmakers who sat down for a group interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that aired on January 3 did seem to form a chummy, sisterly club as they celebrated the milestone of one-fifth female representation in the U.S. Senate.
There was lots of “you-go-girl” nodding, as senator after senator extolled the virtues of female cooperation, collaboration, and can-do workmanship. (“Workwomanship?” It's a word, perhaps, whose time has come.) They agreed that, had women been running the show, there would have been no “fiscal cliff” drama. “We don't believe in the culture of delay,” said Barbara Mikulski, (D-MD.)
Sidestepping partisanship (by neatly avoiding mention of which party does or does not support women's reproductive rights), they jointly expressed frustration with their male colleagues' obsession with abortion. “Can't you just leave that alone?” asked an exasperated Patty Murray (D-WA, and pro-choice.)
(MORE: Viewpoint: “Pro-life” and “feminism” aren't mutually exclusive)
The only smidgeon of a sign of barely possible disagreement came when the newly-elected Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) interrupted a comment from Susan Collins (R-ME) on how politicians should focus on the economy, health care, education and foreign policy and not reproductive issues to interject that in fact access to birth control was still very much an issue – a perhaps too self-assertive gesture that left the colleagues seated around her momentarily unsmiling.
But never mind. Now is not the time to wonder if women reached a level of political participation commensurate to their representation in the voting population (which would give them a majority, not mere parity in government), and if their numbers were more or less evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, they wouldn't find themselves in as much gridlock, with as much conflict and partisan grandstanding as their majority-male colleagues. (“More Women in Senate Likely to Result in Higher Taxes, Bigger Govt, Less Freedom,” was the headline of a statement from the conservative Independent Women's Forum published in the Weekly Standard just hours before Sawyer's interview.)
(MORE: The Next Cliff: Another Round of Debt Brinkmanship Looms)
Thoughts of this kind can wait a few more election cycles, when, one hopes, a female majority will become something other than a dream. In the short-term, as the women of the Senate would say, there's no time for more namby-pamby dilly-dallying. Or as Senator Mikulski put it last night, “Square your shoulders, put your lipstick on and fight the revolution.”
Two stories surfaced last week that amount to a loud vote of no confidence in Rick Santorum as the GOP nominee. ABC News reports that a top Republican senator wants a new choice if Santorum wins Michigan. Why? “ ‘He'd lose 35 states,' the senator said, predicting the same fate for Newt Gingrich.”
This senator is not alone. Mike Allen reports:
A tippy-top Republican, unprompted, . . . sketched the germ of a plan for a new candidate if Rick Santorum upsets Mitt Romney in the Michigan primary on Feb. 28. Our friend brought visual aids: chicken-scratched versions of prosaic documents that are circulating among GOP insiders like nuclear-code sheets: In case of mayhem, break glass!
Most reporters still think Romney “will find a way to win Michigan.” Nevertheless, some of the nation's most powerful Republicans are poring over filing deadlines and pondering worst-case scenarios.
Our friend handed us a printout of FEC deadlines for ballot access, with five of them circled and starred: California (March 23), Montana (March 12), New Jersey (April 2), New Mexico (March 16) and South Dakota (March 27). The point: Even after Feb. 28, it might be possible to assemble a Hail Mary candidacy that could garner enough delegates to force a CONTESTED convention (a different nuance than BROKERED, which implies that someone is in charge).
In other words: “Whom are we kidding? We'll get slaughtered with Santorum as the nominee.”
You see, right-wing, socially conservative pundits don't actually have to win elections, but experienced senators and party operatives who know how to win races outside Republican strongholds aren't putting their heads in the sand. Santorum's views and persona have limited appeal in a general election, and they know it.
There are, of course, many problems with the knight-in-shining-armor plan. Romney wouldn't necessarily get out of the race, and the not-Santorum vote would then be subdivided. A new candidate who actually wants to run and hasn't stood up the party at the altar would have to be located. And the knight might not be so popular with actual voters.
But put that aside for the moment. There is no “back-up” plan circulating if Romney wins. The assumption is that he'd do fine in a general election, so there's no need to find a knight to block him from the nomination. But for Santorum, the opposite is true: His nomination, experienced Republicans know, would sink the party.
But, but — you say — these people were the ones who wanted Charlie Crist instead of now-Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). But, really, Santorum is no Marco Rubio. Whereas Rubio expands the party's base of support, Santorum shrinks it. Whereas women, independents and young people see Rubio as a forward-looking reformer, Santorum seems stuck in a time warp from a different era, someone chases issues that were “lost” decades ago.
Republicans should remember 2010. Republicans could well have had control of the Senate had they not nominated characters such as Christine O'Donnell, Sharron Angle and Ken Buck — fire-breathing Tea Partyers, who were unable to win in swing or blue states.
Those Republicans scurrying for a back-up plan don't want to lose the White House (and likely the House, in the event of a landslide) as they did Senate seats in Delaware, Nevada and Colorado. Voters concerned about electability should take note.
EPA found potential violations at Hawaiian Ice Company prior to ammonia leak Copyright by KHON - All rights reserved Video
A federal finding reveals several potential violations for a company that caused a chemical leak at Honolulu Harbor earlier this week.
The leak happened Monday afternoon at Hawaiian Ice Company at Pier 38, which uses ammonia as a refrigerant. It caused the evacuation of more than a hundred people and one person was sent to the hospital in serious condition.
Hawaiian Ice Company wouldn't talk to us on camera Thursday, but the owner said over the phone that the company is currently dealing with its own team of investigators trying to find out what caused the chemical leak.
Meanwhile, we've learned a routine Environmental Protection Agency inspection determined the "company failed to design and maintain a safe facility." The EPA says a random inspection was conducted in June 2016, and Hawaiian Ice responded this past February.
EPA inspectors noted the company failed to replace pressure relief valves at least every five years, an engine room ammonia sensor was not calibrated since it was originally installed, and the company had incomplete operating procedures, including for the transfer of ammonia.
In a response, Hawaiian Ice Company disputed several of the potential violations, and insisted it was up to code with city and state regulations.
Its response to the ammonia sensor starts by telling EPA that the standard it's basing its finding on has not been adopted in Honolulu, adding it was "unable to locate any records of past calibrations."
The company also said that "the facility does not have incomplete operating procedures" and "having the procedure in writing is not specifically required."
Overall, Hawaiian Ice told the agency it had been safely operating for years. The EPA says it is still reviewing the company's reply.
The Honolulu Fire Department says it inspected Hawaiian Ice Company on April 14, 2017, and found no visible violations or hazards.
We asked the Hawaii Department of Health, which enforces safety codes, why certain Hawaii laws do not follow EPA federal guidelines.
The state responded with this statement: "The Hawaii Department of Health tracks chemical inventories and responds to chemical emergencies. All companies in the State of Hawaii are required to comply with both EPA and state regulations."
We brought the question to state Reps. Chris Lee and Gene Ward.
"I think the bottom line is ensuring safety. If there is a lapse where state or local ordinance are not meeting federal minimums, then we obviously have to take a look at something there," Lee said.
"It's a surprise event where the ammonia escapes and suddenly we find there's an EPA contradiction going on in the state and city regulations," Ward said. "(It's) very surprising. It should be corrected. If it needs to be legislation, we're going to be gone in about five days. We'll pick it up and run with it next year."
Hawaiian Ice says it will be releasing a statement on its findings for the cause of the ammonia leak sometime Friday.
In an interview at the close of the recent Paris climate conference, Secretary of State John Kerry scolded Republican senators for saying out loud that the next president may not be a big supporter of President Barack Obama's climate policies. Kerry asserted voters won't allow a change, “I don't think they're going to accept as a genuine leader someone who doesn't understand the science of climate change and isn't willing to do something about it.”
But Kerry disproves his own theory. In a widely covered speech in Jakarta, Indonesia Kerry gave an absolutely cringe-worthy explanation of CO2 and global warming.
Of course the press totally ignored his bizarre CO2 science lesson:
“I know sometimes I can remember from when I was in high school and college, some aspects of science or physics can be tough – chemistry. But this is not tough. This is simple. Kids at the earliest age can understand this. “Try and picture a very thin layer of gases – a quarter-inch, half an inch, somewhere in that vicinity – that's how thick it is. It's in our atmosphere. It's way up there at the edge of the atmosphere. And for millions of years – literally millions of years – we know that layer has acted like a thermal blanket for the planet – trapping the sun's heat and warming the surface of the Earth to the ideal, life-sustaining temperature. Average temperature of the Earth has been about 57 degrees Fahrenheit, which keeps life going.”
He probably should have stopped with “physics can be tough.” His “a quarter-inch way up there” absolutely does not describe CO2 in the atmosphere. It seems what Kerry had in mind is a very abstract representation of the ozone layer. This may have been relevant a long time ago in a debate far, far away, but it is not a description of CO2 in the atmosphere.
His notion that the Earth has had a steady temperature for “literally millions of years” is also way off base. This National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration webpage shows temperatures have bounced around by 10-25 degrees Fahrenheit ten or so times in the last 800,000 years.
Kerry dismissively lecturing climate skeptics brings Emily Litella to mind. Emily was Gilda Radner's “Saturday Night Live” character whose bad hearing led to impassioned, but hilariously misguided, editorial responses.
Who knows what Kerry's aides were thinking as he recited his mixed-up ozone lecture in the carbon dioxide forum? You can almost imagine them trying to catch Kerry's attention, “Psst! We are talking about CO2, not O3.”
“The Thing” That Wouldn't Die: On the Legacy of John Carpenter's Classic Film October 31, 2017 |
In the span of only a few days, I received Mondo's first board game, a clever riff on John Carpenter's “The Thing” called Infection at Outpost 31, saw a Facebook ad for a screening of the 35-year-old film hosted by the Chicago Film Critics Association, and read about a new Arrow Blu-ray release of the film coming in November. It got me thinking, how many films this old get board games, have theatrical screenings, and get new HD restorations at the same time. “The Thing” is arguably more popular than it's ever been. Why? What is it about this film that has allowed it to sustain while so many others have come and gone? How does a movie that opened in eighth place (just ahead of “Megaforce” and six spots behind “Blade Runner,” which opened on the same day) still have such power 35 years later? And when I opened question up on Twitter, I was blown away by the variety of responses. There isn't just one reason that people still love “The Thing” enough to turn it into an industry of its own—there are dozens, and every one of them as valid as the others.

“The Thing” starts with two elements that will define it—confusion and cold. You can feel the wind circling the camp like the helicopter of Norwegians trying to kill a fleeing dog. What the hell is going on here? The characters are introduced in a state of confusion, surrounded by snow-covered everything, and that confusion will only increase as the true horror of their situation becomes further defined. “The Thing” starts as pure, alien invasion horror—is there anything from that era more disturbing than the dog/alien hybrid, a prime example of one of the film's greatest gifts: stunning practical effects? It's a Lovecraftian vision of body horror, part dog and part something out of your worst nightmare.
And from that brutal scene, “The Thing” develops perhaps its greatest lasting strength as a story of paranoia. The crew soon realizes that their invader can take on the appearance of anyone at the camp. Some of the greatest horror cinema of all time has been built on a foundation of distrust. George A. Romero mined this vein of terror in nearly all of his films, but the thematic undercurrent of an enemy that looks exactly like your friend has arguably never been more well-mined for horror as it is in “The Thing.” As generations hand this film down, that's an element that will never grow old—we will always have distrust in the other, and fear of betrayal of both those we know and our own bodies. And what do we do with that knowledge? What we do when we see that there's a 75% chance someone is invaded and not who we think they are? The relatability of that situation defines the slow, burning horror of what might be John Carpenter's best film.
Of course, Mondo's game uses distrust as its main template as well. Four to eight players embark on a mission to stop the alien invasion at Outpost 31, but one of them starts as an “Imitation,” with the potential for other “Humans” to be infected as the game progresses. It's a board game designed around subterfuge, as the “Imitation” tries to halt the success of other players without giving away that he or she is doing so. It's a game that's played on multiple levels. The instructions even say, “While playing The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31, talking about the current situation is expected. Players share information (which may or may not be true) and the Captain solicits volunteers to handle specific tasks. Chatter makes the game—don't be shy, be sly.” This is such a brilliant way to capture why people still love “The Thing” in another property. A team of less-ambitious designers could have made a pure action-based board game in which humans fight an alien thing, but the team behind this game understand that “The Thing” is about way more than action. It's a very complicated game, but it's one that trusts the intelligence of the film's fan base and their desire to have a tie-in that respects the complexity and the brilliance of its source material.

So why do people still love this movie enough to support a board game in 2017? Here are few choices Twitter responses. Go pick up the game if you still can (it was a limited run by Mondo, as they do with most of their properties) and pre-order the Arrow Blu-ray. You should also take time to read this excellent oral history of the film by our very-own Simon Abrams and Matt Zoller Seitz for The Village Voice.

Constructs
Hey folks,
As we mentioned two weeks ago, we are splitting “Defences” into two separate types, Defences and Constructs. Today we're going to explain why we're doing this and what the change entails.
Before we start: All art, VFX, and audio shown in this post is work-in-progress… especially the stuff in the video!
The Problems
Too many specific rules:
For each Defence the player would be forced to learn where it could be placed. Feedback related to this was unclear at best.
Even with better feedback, and assuming that the player had played the entire campaign and been taught each of the Defences it would be a mess to force players to remember all of these random rules for what should be a very straightforward system.
Now once terrain limitations are factored in (which were already very easy communicate to the player), there's a very simple single rule: Defences only on your own territory, Constructs anywhere not on enemy territory.
The Foundry was too prevalent:
The Foundry being required for several bread-and-butter Wrath Aspects didn't feel quite right to use, and it basically meant that you were almost always required to build a Foundry.
We wanted to remove the Foundry requirement for these ‘Wrath defences' in order to ensure the Foundry kept its purely defence-focused feel and allow Wrath to feel more independent.
Overall, this change gives the player more freedom of choice with what they unlock, build, and use.
What are Constructs?
We've pulled every Defence that wasn't focused on actual defending and put them into this new Category:
Ember Rift
Gold Vortex
Underminer
Outpost
Replacement Earth
Warding Totem
Constructs work differently from Defences in two key ways:
They do not require the Foundry or defence parts to build, instead your workers will need to summon them into existence with some extended dance routines
They can be placed on both claimed and unclaimed territory, including on water (with some exceptions – you can't build earth on water!)
Here's a short video demonstrating the build process (again: visuals are all placeholders):
And here's some concept art of the look we're going to be giving to Constructs (in the order listed above):
More Details
Here's a more detailed breakdown of how Constructs work (and some other related changes) for those of you that are interested.
Placement:
Constructs can be placed on any empty tile not owned by another player
Constructs can be placed on water and bridges not owned by another player (Excluding Outpost, Replacement Earth)
Constructs cannot be constructed on Sacred Ground or Lava
Once Placed:
A blueprint appears that is only visible to the owner (these blueprints will be visually distinct from Defence blueprints)
Gold is deducted and mana is locked right away
If anything modifies the tile (an enemy claims the tile or begins summoning their own construct), the blueprint is removed and the player is given a full refund
Summoning:
Once a worker reaches the blueprint, summoning starts
The construct is now visible to enemies and can be attacked
The construct starts with 20% HP
Summoning will increase the health of the construct
The construct is completed once the health bar is full, allowing enemies to slow or halt construction by attacking it
Replacement Wall:
The Replacement Wall defence has been split into two aspects
defence has been split into two aspects Replacement Earth is a construct, unlocked for free, that allows you to quickly create blocks of unclaimed earth
is a construct, unlocked for free, that allows you to quickly create blocks of unclaimed earth Augrum Wall is a defence, in Sloth, that allows you to replace your walls with a new terrain type that's stronger than normal Earth
Defences:
Defences can now be built on Stone Bridges
Defences are visible to the enemy and attackable once the first part is placed

Victorian Government cuts funding to seven private training providers in 'blitz' on dodgy operators
Updated
Funding to seven education and training providers has been cut as part of an industry-wide crackdown on dodgy operators, the Victorian Government has said.
Three training providers have had their contracts terminated, while four others have been given notice that their funding will be revoked.
The cuts were part of a $9 million "blitz" launched by the Government last month following a review into the quality of the state's vocational education and training system.
Imperial College, MWT Institute and Management Institute of Australia No 2 Pty Ltd were among those to lose funding.
The issues identified at the providers included fraudulent claims for training that did not occur and unauthorised sub-contracting of training delivery.
They also offered incentives or inducements to students to undertake funded training, which is prohibited.
The Government said the $6 million recovered as a result of the cuts would be "re-invested into further measures to improve quality".
"Poor quality, dodgy or non-existent training or breaches of contract are no longer acceptable," Minister for Training and Skills, Steve Herbert, said.
"I'm hoping that will send a strong message to the industry and those that are perhaps not doing the right thing will get out.
"The next thing for the Government is to implement the 19 recommendations of a major review of quality.
"One of those was that there should be more transparency on this and the Department of Education will be publishing from this date on the names of those who have had their contracts terminated."
He said the Department of Education would refer cases where there had been serious misconduct to the police.
The Government said investigations into providers were continuing, with a further 17 under case management.
Editor's note (September 9, 2015): The ABC has been contacted by MWT Institute in relation to this article, and a broadcast dealing with related subject matter on 774 ABC Mornings with Jon Faine on August 18, 2015, to advise that it strongly denies any suggestion that it has committed any fraud or wrongdoing. MWT Institute says further that it has never engaged in any such practices in the course of its business as a training provider.

During the televised press conference in which he announced his tax plan, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump returned to a claim he has made before -- that the official unemployment rate -- currently 5.1 percent -- woefully undercounts the percentage of people who are unemployed.
During the Sept. 28, 2015, media event, Trump described an unemployment rate in the range of 5 percent as "such a phony number."
"The number isn't reflective," he said. "I've seen numbers of 24 percent -- I actually saw a number of 42 percent unemployment. Forty-two percent." He continued, "5.3 percent unemployment -- that is the biggest joke there is in this country. … The unemployment rate is probably 20 percent, but I will tell you, you have some great economists that will tell you it's a 30, 32. And the highest I've heard so far is 42 percent."
We previously rated False a claim by Trump that "our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent." So if 18 to 20 percent is false, how does 42 percent rate? We took a closer look.
We'll start by offering a refresher about how the official unemployment rate is calculated.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency, uses surveys and statistical sampling to calculate how many Americans do or don't work. To calculate the unemployment rate, the agency divides the number of people who are out of work (counting only those who have recently looked for work) by the sum of the job-seeking and job-holding population.
Not factored into this calculation are people who are not currently looking for work.
This is the portion of the population that alternative measures -- such as those cited by Trump -- attempt to factor in. Broadly speaking, supporters of these alternative measures say that not working, regardless of the reason, is tantamount to being unemployed, and should be reflected that way in the official measurements.
The 42% calculation
We asked the Trump campaign for a source of the 42 percent figure, but they didn't respond. The Fact Checker, however, traced it back to a column by David Stockman, who served as President Ronald Reagan's budget director.
Stockman calculated that there are currently 210 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 68 -- what he calls a "plausible measure of the potential workforce." If you assume that each of those people is able to hold down a full-time job, he wrote, they would offer a total of 420 billion potential working hours. However, during 2014, Stockman noted, only 240 billion working hours were actually recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
If you run the numbers, "the real unemployment rate was 42.9 percent," Stockman wrote.
Economists say Stockman's way of looking at the question -- using actual hours worked divided by a theoretical maximum that could have been worked, rather than determining whether individual people are employed or unemployed -- is provocative. But they say this raw measurement has serious flaws.
In the column, Stockman himself acknowledges that this figure is imperfect, even though his tone is flip when he does so.
"Yes, we have to allow for non-working wives, students, the disabled, early retirees and coupon clippers," he wrote. "We also have drifters, grifters, welfare cheats, bums and people between jobs, enrolled in training programs, on sabbaticals and much else."
Snark aside, economists say this caveat is crucial.
Stockman's calculation "treats people voluntarily working part-time hours as partly unemployed, even if they have excellent reasons for wanting to hold only a part-time job, such as rearing children, attending school or college, being disabled, or transitioning into retirement," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "A lot of the shortfall between full-time and part-time employment is perfectly reasonable, as is a potential worker's decision not to work or look for paid work at all."
In other words, Trump's faith in the accuracy of the 42 percent figure is misplaced.
Taking another whack at the numbers
All of these spotlights a long-running debate among economists about whether there is a better way to calculate the unemployment rate than the one traditionally used. It's within the economic mainstream to believe that the traditional method that produces 5.1 percent is too limiting, even if the far more permissive calculation that produces 42 percent is vastly overstated.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics itself offers a more expansive alternative measurement of labor "underutilization" called the U-6 rate. The U-6 rate includes both those who are officially "unemployed" and those who are working part time for economic reasons and those who are "marginally attached" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force.
Currently the U-6 rate is 10.3 percent, about double the official unemployment rate. For the sake of argument, we decided to see if we could come up with a percentage that approaches Trump's 42 percent.
We started with the 94 million Americans age 16 and up who are not either (1) employed, (2) unemployed, (3) in the military or (4) institutionalized. We then subtracted the number of people who have good reasons not to be working or looking for work. Here's a summary.
In other words, there are perhaps 11.5 million Americans who do not have obvious reasons for not working (though they could be full-time students between 34 and 65, undergoing job training over age 29, or be affluent enough to be able to forgo work or retire early).
If you turn this into a new type of "unemployment" rate, it comes out to 16.4 percent. That's higher than the U-6 rate of 10.3 percent, but it's only a small fraction of the 42 percent Trump claimed.
As Burtless told us previously, most of those suffering from being "out of work" can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society.
"The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits," he said.
This isn't the first time Trump has used the 42 percent number. In August, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave a similar statement from Trump Four Pinocchios, the column's harshest rating for truthfulness. Trump then repeated it in his tax-plan press conference.
Our ruling
Trump keeps repeating that the unemployment rate may be as high as 42 percent. But getting a percentage that high requires believing that being a high school, college or graduate student, a senior citizen, a stay-at-home parent, a job-training participant, or having a disability is no excuse for not holding down a job, or for working less than 40 hours in a week. The highest alternative unemployment-rate measure we could come up with that had any credibility was 16.4 percent, and even that exaggerated figure is only about one-third of the way to Trump's 42 percent. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.
CORRECTION, Feb. 11, 2016: We've updated this story to reflect some changes to the statistics for students listed in the table. Our new calculation puts the highest "unemployment" rate we could produce at 16.4 percent. The rating remains Pants on Fire.

SF COP FILES NEW SUIT: An African American San Francisco police officer who says he was racially profiled by white colleagues during a traffic stop has filed a new federal civil rights lawsuit against the city.
The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, says Officer Lorenzo Adamson was wrongfully singled out for criminal prosecution and termination because of his first suit over the traffic stop.
Adamson said he was stopped in his Honda Accord by a field training officer on Lane Street in the Bayview neighborhood about 8:15 p.m. May 30, 2013 for not having a license plate.
Officer Brian Stansbury immediately asked Adamson if he was on probation or parole, a question that made Adamson believe he was being racially profiled.
Adamson says he objected to Stansbury's question and told the officer, "What does not having a plate on my car have to do with being on parole or probation? Shouldn't you be asking for my license, registration and insurance?" the suit said.
Stansbury replied, "That's what we do out here," according to Adamson.
An attorney for Adamson has said his client's license plate had broken off and was inside the car.
Stansbury warned Adamson that he would take him out of the car if he didn't answer his question, the suit said. Adamson got out but became concerned because he believed being asked to exit his vehicle for a traffic violation deviated from standard police procedure, the suit said.
When an officer grabbed Adamson's wrist and told him to sit down, Adamson said he was an officer at the Bayview Station.
Officers then forcefully tackled him to the ground.
A federal jury found that two of the officers didn't use excessive force, and Adamson voluntarily dismissed the remainder of his first lawsuit.
Adamson wants to be reinstated to his former position and wants the department to fully investigate the officers involved in his traffic stop.
"Despite the fact that all three of the officers who arrested plaintiff on May 30, 2013, had committed multiple acts of misconduct in connection with the arrest, subsequent investigations, and litigation, none of the three were disciplined," the new suit says.
The city has not responded to the latest suit in court.
EX-PITTSBURG COPS SUE CITY: Two former police officers sued the city of Pittsburg today, saying they were forced to resign and effectively fired because they accused the Police Department of fraudulently reporting its crime statistics.
Elisabeth Anne Terwilliger and Michael Sibbitt filed separate lawsuits in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
Both joined Pittsburg police in 2012. They say they learned early on in their careers that the department was instructing officers to "falsify crime reports, refrain from documenting use of force, and submit police reports for lower crime classifications to result in the appearance of lower crime statistics in the City of Pittsburg."
Among other things, they say the department often misclassified certain felonies as "suspicious circumstances."
The two officers spoke to each other about this, and Sibbitt "complained internally" and reported the "fraudulent policies" to outside agencies, including the Contra Costa County sheriff's office, the suits say.
Pittsburg police began retaliating against Terwilliger for associating with Sibbitt, her suit says. The department placed her on administrative leave in 2014 and refused to reinstate her unless she "sacrificed" Sibbitt for submitting an inaccurate incident report, the suit says.
"When she refused to lie for the department's cause, she was accused of undefined 'alleged misconduct' and threatened with criminal prosecution if she did not resign from the department. Defendant's threats and actions resulted in plaintiff's constructive termination" in 2014, the suit says.
The complaints also accuse the department of sabotaging both of their hopes for employment elsewhere by "misrepresenting her background and reason for termination to prospective employers."
The complaints seek unspecified damages and names the city of Pittsburg and Police Chief Brian Addington. The defendants haven't responded to the suits in court.
At Addington's request, Contra Costa County District Attorney Mark Peterson examined all of the department's police reports that had been classified as "suspicious circumstances" last year.
Of 204 reports, 103 should not have been documented as crimes and not suspicious circumstances, Peterson found. But the 103 reports only represent 1 percent of all police reports written that year and even if they were correctly classified, it would have only had a "minimal impact" on the city's crime rate, the prosecutor said.

I didn't know whether to scream or laugh when Italy's Prodi joined the debate last week by declaring that it is "common sense" not to wear the nikab because it makes social relations "more difficult." Nonsense. If this is the case, then why are cellphones, landlines, e-mail, text messaging and fax machines in daily use? And no one switches off the radio because they can't see the presenter's face.
Under Islam, I am respected. It tells me that I have a right to an education and that it is my duty to seek out knowledge, regardless of whether I am single or married. Nowhere in the framework of Islam are we told that women must wash, clean or cook for men. As for how Muslim men are allowed to beat their wives -- it's simply not true. Critics of Islam will quote random Koranic verses or hadith, but usually out of context. If a man does raise a finger against his wife, he is not allowed to leave a mark on her body, which is the Koran's way of saying, "Don't beat your wife, stupid."
It is not just Muslim men who must reevaluate the place and treatment of women. According to a recent National Domestic Violence Hotline survey, 4 million American women experience a serious assault by a partner during an average 12-month period. More than three women are killed by their husbands and boyfriends every day -- that is nearly 5,500 since 9/11.
Violent men don't come from any particular religious or cultural category; one in three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime, according to the hotline survey. This is a global problem that transcends religion, wealth, class, race and culture.
But it is also true that in the West, men still believe that they are superior to women, despite protests to the contrary. They still receive better pay for equal work -- whether in the mailroom or the boardroom -- and women are still treated as sexualized commodities whose power and influence flow directly from their appearance.
And for those who are still trying to claim that Islam oppresses women, recall this 1992 statement from the Rev. Pat Robertson, offering his views on empowered women: Feminism is a "socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians."
Now you tell me who is civilized and who is not.

Benedict Cumberbatch is one of a host of high-profile interviewees who will appear in a new autobiographical documentary about Stephen Hawking.

Science enthusiast Cumberbatch was nominated for a Bafta for his portrayal of the physicist in the 2004 BBC drama series Hawking, and in 2012 narrated three-part documentary series Stephen Hawking's Grand Design.
The 36-year-old Sherlock star will be joined by actor Jim Carrey, businessman Sir Richard Branson, Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin and physicist Roger Penrose in the new Channel 4 production – also entitled Hawking – which will explore the extraordinary life story of the world's most famous physicist.
The film – which will get a cinema release before being screened on TV – aims to chart Prof Hawking's development from childhood underachiever to scientific genius and media personality, and will explain how the Brief History of Time author learned to adapt to life after being diagnosed with Motor Neurone disease.
Hawking himself will be on hand to relate his story in his own words and his ex-wife Jane and sister Mary will provide insight about his private life.
“It's a story that most of us have been aware of over the years, and so one kind of forgets how extraordinary it is,” said Chanel 4's Senior Commissioning Editor David Glover.
“In this film he tells us the story of his life – making it the definitive film about Hawking. He does it in a rather understated, modest, British way – which makes it all the more moving. I think it's a film that people will still be watching a hundred years from now.”

The film's executive producer Ben Bowie added: “We are honoured to have had the opportunity to film and capture the most intimate details of Stephen Hawking's life. Through Hawking's own words, as well as those closest to him, viewers have an opportunity to get a fresh perspective on one of the greatest scientists of our time.”
• US confirms 8 May meeting in Havana • Cuba says four men were planning 'terrorist actions'
Cuba gave information to US about four held in Florida for planning attacks
US diplomats confirmed on Saturday that Cuban officials have given them some information about four Florida residents who were arrested on suspicion of preparing attacks against military installations on the island.
The US Interests Section in Havana issued a statement confirming the 8 May meeting with representatives of the Cuban ministry of foreign affairs. It said: "The Cubans provided some information about the allegations which we are now reviewing."
Cuba's interior ministry said the men – identified as José Ortega Amador, Obdulio Rodríguez Gonzalez, Raibel Pacheco Santos and Félix Monzón Álvarez – were detained on 26 April for planning "terrorist actions" against military installations, masterminded from Florida.
None of the four are well-known within the exile community in South Florida, but Cuba claimed they were acting on orders from others with a history of militancy, singling out Santiago Álvarez Fernández Magriñá, Osvaldo Mitat and Manuel Alzugaray in Miami.
Santiago Alvarez and Mitat pleaded guilty in 2006 in the US to conspiracy after an informant tipped the FBI that a large cache of weapons, including machine guns and a grenade launcher, was being moved from apartments Alvarez owned.
Alvarez denied involvement in any plot and said he did not know the detained men.
A new study led by Lauren Welbourne from the University of York, UK, has revealed that humans see things differently in summer compared with winter.
Humans identify four unique hues – blue, green, yellow and red – that do not appear to contain mixtures of other colors. Unique yellow (UY) is particularly interesting to scientists as it is stable across large populations – everyone agrees what UY looks like despite the fact that people's eyes are often very different.
Ms Welbourne and his colleagues from the University of York wanted to discover why UY is so stable and what factors might make it change.
They thought that this color might depend not on the biology of the eye but on the color of the natural world.
“What we are finding is that between seasons our vision adapts to changes in environment. So in summer when there is a much larger amount of foliage, our visual system has to account for the fact that on average we are exposed to far more green,” said Ms Welbourne, PhD student at the University of York's Department of Psychology and first author of the paper published in the journal Current Biology.
The team measured 67 participants in York, UK, in both the winter and summer, and found a significant seasonal change in UY settings.
The participants were placed in a darkened room, allowed to adjust to the light and then on a colorimeter asked to adjust a dial backwards and forwards until they felt they had reached the point where it had reached UY – with no hint of a green or red.
“I take lots of measurements of the setting in both seasons, and find a shift in the average setting between seasons,” Ms Welbourne said.
“This is the first time natural changes in the environment have been shown to affect our perception of color. For me as a vision scientist it is fascinating as it is telling us more about how visual processing works.”
“Although there's no disorder that this can fix, the more we learn about how vision and color in particular is processed, the better we can understand exactly how we see the world. This can have knock on effects on the way we diagnose and treat visual disorders.”
It provides an example of how humans constantly adapt to their surroundings.
“Many places in the world have very different environments throughout the year. Think about the changes that the rainy season brings to India, or winter and summer in the arctic. So this process is very useful because you can adapt to these huge seasonal changes in environmental color and continue to see and discriminate between colors accurately,” Ms Welbourne said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's decision to send troops to Georgia has set a new standard for defending its national interests and the United States must learn to live with it, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday.

Russia crushed its southern neighbor in a brief war last month after Georgia tried to recapture by force its pro-Moscow, separatist region of South Ossetia. It drew Western condemnation by pushing far beyond the disputed area, bombing and deploying troops deep inside Georgia proper.
“Through its response to the Georgian aggression, Russia has set a kind of standard for reaction, which fully complies with international law,” Lavrov told students of Moscow's diplomatic college in a speech to mark the start of the new academic year.
“Russia has returned to the world stage as a responsible state which can defend its citizens.”
Any doubts about this should have been dispelled by its action in Georgia and recognition of two pro-Russian provinces as independent states, said Lavrov, whose harshest words were addressed to Washington and NATO.
“America needs to acknowledge the reality of the post-American world and start adapting to it,” Lavrov said. “An attempt to live in its own unipolar world has gone on too long, and this is dangerous in every respect.”
He added: “There is a feeling that NATO again needs frontline states to justify its existence.”
However, he reiterated Moscow's commitment to continue dialogue with the United States.
“We will deal with any America,” Lavrov said, urging Washington to exercise “reciprocity and absolute honesty” in ties. “We will continue talking to Washington as long as there is a tiny hope of understanding each other and making a deal.”
“MOMENT OF TRUTH”
The speech, focused on new relations between Russia and the West, was made hours before EU leaders were due to gather in Brussels to discuss a common stance in the Georgian crisis. Lavrov made clear Russia would not bow to any pressure.
He was expounding new foreign policy guidelines set by President Dmitry Medvedev, who despite Western expectations of a softer line has formalized the assertive stance of his predecessor Vladimir Putin.
Medvedev said in a television interview on Sunday that Russia would adhere to international law but not accept a U.S.-led “unipolar world”, and laid claim to specific spheres of national interest that Russia would defend.
Over the past few years, the West has been watching with alarm the increasingly assertive policy of a resurgent Russia, fearing a revival of Soviet-era imperialism.
Russia, in turn, has accused the West of building new lines of division in the world by failing to treat it as an equal.
Lavrov said the conflict in Georgia had come as a “long-cherished moment of truth”, adding that “today's clarity is better than any ambiguity.”
Europe's inability to produce a new collective security system, “open for everyone and taking into account everyone's interests”, was to blame for the Georgia crisis, he said.
“Something should be done because otherwise Euro-Atlantic affairs will keep returning to square one.”

Russia has proposed calling a security conference in Europe, to create new arrangements for neutralizing threats in the continent.
It views NATO's eastward expansion and the deployment of parts of a U.S. missile defense system in Eastern Europe as a direct threat to its security. Plans to grant NATO membership to ex-Soviet Georgia and Ukraine are anathema for Moscow.
“In the absence of a reasonable multilateral dialogue we will be forced to react unilaterally,” Lavrov said. “But we would indeed prefer joint work on European security issues.”

Podcast: Daphne Bramham on the child poverty report.
It's a shameful and longstanding distinction that a greater percentage of B.C. children live in poverty than anywhere else in Canada, and 2011 was no exception.
You can argue over which Statistics Canada data to use — low-income after tax or before tax, market basket measure, or the deprivation index.
But it doesn't alter the fact that British Columbia's record is abysmal.
At best — using the 2011 after tax, low-income cut-off — 93,000 B.C. kids, or 11.3 per cent of all children in the province, lived in poverty.
At worst — using the before tax, low-income cut-off — there were 153,000, or 18.6 per cent of all children, live in families struggling with high housing costs, low wages and unavailable or unaffordable childcare.
There's an even more shocking and distressing statistic if you drill down into the numbers, as Lorraine Copas of the Social Planning and Research Council of B.C. did to prepare the 2013 Child Poverty Report Card, which was released Tuesday.
Preschoolers are way more likely than any other children to be living in poverty. Put a different way: One in five kids under the age of six likely doesn't get enough food to eat, isn't properly clothed or housed.
At 21 per cent, that's eight percentage point higher than the national average, and nearly three percentage points higher than the B.C. average.
What makes that statistic so awful is that it is well-documented and even frequently acknowledged by politicians that the early years are crucially important to a child's emotional, mental, social and physical development.
Poverty often robs those preschoolers of the opportunity to reach their highest potential, get a good job and live to a healthy old age. As a society, allowing them to grow up in poverty means that we have already forfeited a generation of workers and potentially engaged citizens and taxpayers.
“Investment in poverty reduction is an investment in health and probably the best investment you can make in health-care prevention,” Ted Bruce, Vancouver Coastal Health's executive director of population health, said Tuesday after the report was released.
Among the statistics that Bruce gave are these: Lower-income children are 1.7 times more likely to go to hospital for asthma-related problems; poor people are twice as likely to have serious illnesses and die as much as a decade before high-income earners; and, as the report notes, the gap between rich and poor in British Columbia is greater than in any other province.
Bruce also said it is time to dispel the myth that poor kids have junkies and alcoholics for parents. The overwhelming number of low-income children — 60 per cent — come from families with two working parents, who are struggling to feed, clothe and house their families. Many of those working families are new immigrants.
But there is another alarming statistic in the report card. The poverty rate for children living in families headed by lone mothers more than doubled to 49.8 per cent in 2011, up from 21.5 per cent the previous year. That increase tracks the precipitous drop in median market income for single mothers to $21,500 from $32,000 in 2010. That happened over the same period that the median incomes for single moms in every other province rose.
France, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the U.K., Germany and Mexico are among the more than two dozen countries that have so far signed on to what one day will likely be recognized as the most significant climate initiative in history.
France's 4/1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate puts regenerative food and farming front and center in the climate solutions conversation. This is why the Organic Consumers Association (OCA), our Mexico affiliate, Via Organica, IFOAM Organics International and more than 50 of our other activist allies across the globe have signed on in support of the Initiative.
Unfortunately, the U.S. government is not yet on board with the plan—even though our country's toxic, fossil-fuel-based, heavily subsidized (with taxpayer money), degenerative industrial agriculture system is a primary driver of global warming.
A global problem, a global solution
Leaders from 190 countries convened in Paris on November 30 for the 14-day COP21 Paris Climate Conference. This year, for the first time in over 20 years of United Nations (UN) climate negotiations, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) set out to achieve something concrete: “a legally binding and universal agreement to make sure the Earth doesn't get warmer than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.”
To meet that goal, the French Government launched the 4/1000 Initiative which, distilled to the simplest terms, says this: If, on a global scale, we increase the soil carbon content of the soil by .04 percent each year for the next 25 years, we can draw down a critical mass of excess carbon from the atmosphere and begin to reverse global warming.
Is the French Initiative realistic? Yes, even by conservative estimates.
Industrial, degenerative farming practices, which include tilling, deforestation, wetlands destruction and the use of massive amounts of synthetic and toxic fertilizers and pesticides, have stripped 136 billion tons of carbon out of the soil and sent it up into the atmosphere. Using the French government's modest estimates, we can transfer, via enhanced plant photosynthesis, 250 billion tons of this carbon back into the soil in the next 25 years.
How do we achieve those numbers? All we have to do is help just 10 percent of the world's farmers and ranchers adopt regenerative organic agriculture, holistic grazing and land management practices—and by help, we mean direct a portion of the billions of dollars earmarked for climate solution projects to farmers who regenerate, not degenerate, the world's soils.
That's a game changer. But only if enough players get in game.
The plan is here, the time is now
According to a December 1 press release from the French agriculture minister's office:
This initiative intends to show that a small increase of 4/1000 per year of the soil carbon stock (agricultural soils, notably grasslands and pastures, and forest soils) is a major leverage in order to improve soil fertility, resilience of farmers and contribute to the long-term objective of keeping the global average temperature increase below 2 degrees.
France's Agriculture Minister, Stéphane Le Foll, said that Initiative partners, which so far include the UN, developed and developing states, international organizations, private foundations, international funds, NGOs, consumer, and farmers' organizations, have committed to implementing appropriate soil management practices, and to recognizing the importance of soil health for the transition towards productive, highly resilient agriculture.
Le Foll told the French media that the 4/1000 has become a global initiative, but it's just the beginning:
“We need to keep going and mobilize even more stakeholders in a transition to achieve both food security and climate mitigation thanks to agriculture.”
Will the U.S. become one of those stakeholders? Or will our leaders side with the Monsantos and Bill Gates of the world, and continue to promote an agricultural system that directly and indirectly contributes 50 percent (or more) of the greenhouse gas emissions that are burning up the planet? A system that has failed to feed the world, failed to reduce the use of toxic poisons, failed to bring prosperity to the world's small farmers, failed to produce healthy, nutritious food—a system whose successes can only be counted in terms of gross profits, shareholder value and political clout.
Whatever it takes
President Obama, who attended the COP21, hasn't been shy about linking global warming to national security. The President recently told PoliticPro:
"If we let the world keep warming as fast as it is, and sea-levels rising as fast as they are and weather patterns keep shifting in unexpected ways, then before long we are going to have to devote more and more and more of our economic and military resources not to growing opportunity for our people, but to adapting to the various consequences of a changing planet," Obama said. "This is an economic and security imperative that we have to tackle now."
If focusing on the economy and national security is what it takes to motivate Obama to tackle climate change, we're all for it. After all, global warming threatens to displace millions of people, many of whom already are in a struggle just to survive.
We're also all for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which is why we support the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan which requires states to cut carbon emissions by 32 percent by 2030. Absolutely, let's transition from an extractive, fossil fuel-intensive energy system to a clean, renewable alternative. That transition should be a vital part of any global strategy to mitigate climate change.
But reducing emissions solves only half of the problem. We also have to draw down the billions of tons of CO2 currently heating up the atmosphere. Unless we address the climate change elephant in the room—Big Ag—we will fail to solve the climate crisis.
Scientists estimate the world's soils have lost 50 – 70 percent of their carbon stocks and fertility. Modern chemical-intensive, factory-farm, GMO-based industrial agriculture is largely responsible for that loss. Left unchecked, Monsanto and corporate aqribusiness will continue to destroy our soils, pollute our bodies and eventually take the whole planet down with them.
The French Initiative is the most direct, most practical, and only shovel-ready plan for reversing climate change.
We don't need, and don't have time to wait for expensive, unproven techno-fixes à la Bill Gates, some of which haven't even made it to the prototype stage, and many of which could come with unintended consequences.
We don't need a corporate-focused “Climate-Smart Agriculture” scheme that promotes business as usual.
And we definitely shouldn't put our faith in Monsanto's “carbon-neutral” but “poison-positive” plan.
What we need is to pressure President Obama to pledge U.S. support for France's 4/1000 Initiative, now. If we're going to subsidize any form of agriculture, it should be the regenerative, truly climate-friendly, health-friendly, farmer-friendly type.

Now in its fifth year, the Chasing Mailboxes Coffeeneuring Challenge is a relaxed weekend cycling endeavor for cyclists everywhere. If you like riding a bike and enjoy drinking coffee or tea (or even hot chocolate), consider taking on this challenge.
In a nod to the French as well as randonneuring, the Coffeeneuring Challenge has its share of rules. Don't let them intimidate you, though. As those who have successfully completed the challenge in previous years will attest, they are all manageable.
Rules are slightly updated from last year, and include an optional “Theme Within a Theme” category, to allow people to really show off their creativity when it comes to drinking coffee and riding bikes.
Here's what you have to do to officially coffeeneur:
Ride your bike to 7 different local coffee shops from Saturday October 3 through Sunday, November 15. Any place that sells coffee– or “coffee,” as the case may be– qualifies as a coffee shop. UPDATE: Coffeeneurs who are not bound by weekend days, challenge dates extended through FRIDAY, November 19. You may also coffeeneur to a Coffee Shop Without Walls. A Coffee Shop Without Walls is a place, such as a park or campsite, where you ride your bike to proceed to make and/or drink coffee. After much debate, it has been determined that only Saturday and Sunday rides qualify. Weekday rides are ineligible, unless one of the following applies to you: a. You have a job that does not have a Monday through Friday tour of duty. In that case, your days off are considered your weekend; or b. You are retired, in which case you may choose any two days to complete your coffeeneuring outings. No other exceptions, unless you can make a convincing case for one. UPDATE: Someone asked me about how the challenge applied to those who do not work a Monday-Friday schedule, and asked about extending the dates for eligible coffeeneuring trips. For those non-weekender coffeeneurs (or if you have vacation or whatever other rule might apply to you in these final days) the contest officially goes until Friday, November 19, midnight in your area! Only 1 coffee shop per day counts and a maximum of two rides per weekend. Jot down a summary of your experience that includes: 1. where you went (address and website, if possible), 2. the date you went there, 3. what you drank 4. a detail or two about your coffeeneuring ride, including your assessment of the “bike friendliness” of the location; and 5. total mileage. If you find any “must visit” coffee shops or tea places please share that as well. Take a photo during your outing or provide some other form of evidence that you rode your bike for coffee, and submit it as verification. Hot chocolate qualifies, as does tea. Apple cider is also a coffeeneuring-approved beverage. Note: Drinks do not have to be hot! They just have to be coffeeneuring-ish type drinks. You may not combine your coffeeneuring ride with any other ride such as an organized century, populaire, or brevet. You may, however, combine your coffeeneuring ride with a casual shop ride, grocery run, ride to the gym, an informal ride with friends, or other transportation/utility-oriented ride. (If you do an organized ride, you may do another, separate coffeeneuring ride on the same day, e.g., a pre- or post-event ride to get a latte either before or after your organized ride.) Your ride must be at least two miles total, but there is no maximum so yes, you could ride 100 miles (or more!) for a cup of coffee. There are no geographic limitations to the Coffeeneuring Challenge, except that your coffeeneuring must occur on planet Earth. You have to go to 7 different places, although you may ride to multiple locations of a chain, if necessary. For the Coffee Shop Without Walls, prepare and/or drink your coffee in different places. That means seven different campsites/locales. Theme Within a Theme! New for 2015, a theme within a theme is any additional theme you use to go coffeeneuring. Maybe that theme is “If you own more than one bike, ride all the bikes you own” suggested by Mr. Urban Adventure League or the @AstridBear “Tour de Kiosk” coffeeneuring theme. This is an option, but not a fast rule so have fun with it as you see fit. Deadline for submitting Coffeeneuring Challenge entries is whenever the clock strikes midnight in your area on November 25, 2015. Send submissions to me at gersemalina “at” gmail.com. They may be in the form of links to blog writeups, screenshots of or links to your coffeeneuring Tweets, on-line photo galleries with accompanying narrative, Word documents with attached or embedded photos, or e-mail writeups and submissions with photos attached. UPDATE! If you complete the challenge as a group, you may provide one submission for all of you, provided you completed all rides together. Provide all qualifying rides at the same time. That is, send me all 7 together. Prizes! You are eligible for a small prize for finishing the challenge. Because of the increased interest in coffeeneuring, the premium will cost $5 which covers my costs. To purchase your prize, you may PayPal me at the gmail address above, or send your money by snail mail like grandma used to do. Email me for my address. If you are an international entry the prize will cost you an extra US $1. Tara Rule and Canadian Thanksgiving: During Columbus Day weekend (October 10-12), you have three days to accomplish two qualifying coffeeneuring rides. (This is the Tara Rule.) Residents of Canada may use Canadian Thanksgiving in place of Columbus Day. Vacation Rule: If you are on vacation during the coffeeneuring challenge, you may coffeeneur any two days of the week for the weeks you are on vacation. Veterans Day Rule: You may coffeeneur on November 11, Veteran's Day, INSTEAD of the previous Saturday or Sunday. Veterans are permitted to coffeeneur on November 11 in ADDITION to the weekend days, in recognition of their service. Buying Beans Rule: You may use ONE of your seven coffeeneuring trips to purchase beans (or tea) from your local roaster or tea emporium for future consumption.
Twitter and Instagram: The hashtag for the Coffeeneuring Challenge is #coffeeneuring. Only tweet and/or post on Instagram if you like. This is a no-pressure situation.
Flickr: Share your photos in the Coffeeneuring group on flickr.
Facebook: There's even a Coffeeneurs Facebook group where you can post and share your coffeeneuring.
Blog it: Let me know if you blog your coffeeneuring, as I'll do periodic roundups along the way.
I think that covers it. 20 rules for the 7-ride Coffeeneuring Challenge. One more than 2014, but still, simpler than it seems.
It all starts October 3. Seven shops in seven weekends. I know you can do it!
As always, if you have any questions, feel free to put them in the comments section.

[image-62][image-78][image-94]When the newest Landsat spacecraft trains its state-of-the-art sensors on Earth's surface, it will provide images of our ever-changing planet in unparalleled clarity.
Launched by NASA in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey, the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) will add a new chapter to an enduring program. Since 1972, Landsat has enabled people around the globe to observe our planet's land masses. The enhanced images that will be provided by improved Landsat data come at a time when such information is vitally important.
"With increasing population, and with advances in technology, our land cover and land use are currently changing at a rate unprecedented in human history," said Jim Irons, LDCM project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
LDCM will be lofted into orbit aboard a two-stage United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The five-year mission will begin with a launch from Space Launch Complex 3 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Once in orbit, after three months of extensive testing, the LDCM satellite will be renamed Landsat 8 and operational control will then be transferred to USGS.
Six Landsat satellites have successfully launched since the first made its debut in 1972. Jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey, the Landsat program has provided continuous views of Earth's surface for more than four decades. Landsat 7, the most recent in the series, launched in April 1999.
The Landsat Data Continuity Mission builds on this foundation and brings with it two advanced science instruments that will deliver more data - and clearer images - than ever before. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) is designed to measure visible, near infrared, and short wave infrared wavelengths, while the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) monitors temperatures on the Earth's surface. Using what scientists call a "push-broom" approach, these detectors will record a constant stream of data as the spacecraft passes 438 miles overhead in a near-circular, near-polar orbit.
"All earlier Landsat sensors, on Landsats 1 through 7, were called 'whisk-broom sensors.' Each one of these sensors used a mirror that oscillated back and forth," Irons said.
"In contrast, both of the sensors on the Landsat Data Continuity Mission, OLI and TIRS, instead of using an oscillating mirror, they will use long arrays of detectors across the focal plane of each instrument."
During each satellite pass, OLI and TIRS will observe and collect image data for a 185-kilometer-wide swath of land. As Earth rotates beneath the satellite's orbit, subsequent seams of land will come into view, providing a complete picture of the planet's surface every 16 days.
To keep Landsat over water during the critical period of liftoff and ascent, managers selected Vandenberg Air Force Base as the mission's launch site. LDCM will be the first NASA mission launched at Space Launch Complex 3 since the agency's Terra satellite launched more than a dozen years ago. But despite a few changes, the launch team hasn't encountered any difficulties during launch preparations, said Omar Baez, senior launch director in NASA's Launch Services Program based at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
"They're operating out of a new control center since we launched back then," Baez said. "But it's still the Atlas V, still the Atlas V crew. There are folks we've worked with for years. It's like coming home."
The rocket's booster and Centaur stages were erected at the pad in October 2012. The LDCM spacecraft arrived at Vandenberg in December and underwent final prelaunch tests and closeouts before it was installed atop the rocket Jan. 25.
With launch only a few days away, LDCM/Landsat 8 will soon begin sending home data to be used for years to come.
"The data is used by thousands of users all over the world for things like land resource monitoring, crop health identification, crop yield calculations, monitoring urban sprawl, urban planning - the data is used all over the place," said Del Jenstrom, deputy project manager for the mission.
"And to me, that's very rewarding, to work with such a great team of people on a mission that really does affect people's lives."

Robots may not be taking over the world just yet, but they do seem to be invading the world of factual television.
The BBC revealed in January that its iconic entertainment program Robot Wars, which first aired from 1998 to 2004, would make a comeback on the UK pubcaster this year, and ABC's BattleBots is now being shopped internationally by Sky Vision. And who can forget Nippon TV's android-hosted series Mastuko-Roid, launched last October at MIPCOM.
Chris Brogden, creative director for entertainment at Tinopolis Group, sat down with realscreen to discuss BBC2′s science-oriented Robot Wars reboot, which he is exec producing alongside Tinopolis-owned prodco Mentorn Scotland, in association with SJP Media.
Brogden boarded Tinopolis in the newly created position in April 2015, with the aim of developing new formats for the company's slate of 17 U.S. and UK prodcos, including Magical Elves, A. Smith & Co., Firecracker Films and Mentorn Media.
The 6 x 60-minute series – which is currently being edited – finds 40 “contestant” robots and four “house” robots battling it out in a purpose-built, bulletproof arena in Glasgow, Scotland. The six episodes consist of five qualifying rounds and a grand finale, with each episode starting with eight robots and only one advancing. In addition to a wild card robot picked by a panel of judges, six robots face off in the last episode.
Can you tell me more about the bullet-proof arena? Why is it bulletproof, to start?
We had one robot that's got a spinning steel blade as its weapon. That spins at 2,500 RPM which means the tip of it is going faster than a speeding bullet, and when that hits that bit of metal and that bit of metal flies off, and you add that speed and that goes off, effectively you've got bits of shrapnel flying off that are going as fast as bullets. So we have to have an arena that can withstand that.
It's all to do with the differences in the reboot. The big differences in the robots are that they're way more powerful and faster than they used to be. So the technological advances of the nine, 10 years in the materials they make them [with] are stronger and lighter, and the battery power is much, much stronger. Without being too technical, the lithium batteries are much smaller, which means that – [in addition to] the materials – the robots are just much more powerful.
How big is the arena?
It's 20 meters by 20 meters, and weighs 90 tons. It's seven meters high, and it's made of polycarbonate.
How many cameras do you have going?
In the BBC version, we had 11 cameras. We had one on a track in the arena. And that's the other advance – the camera technology – because with GoPros we have a lot more cameras in the arena. We've got them inside and on the house robots, which we've never had before, so you're much closer to the action in the new version.
Editorially, the update is that we just focused a little bit more on the stories of the people – the builders and the roboteers. The stories of where they come from, why they're building a robot. It just gives it a little bit more human interest. The battles are fantastic - and the battles are still the focus of it – and everybody loves them, but there's just a little bit more story throughout it. And for BBC2, a little bit more science and explaining how they work and what they do.
How big are the robots?
A big part of our format [is] the house robots. [Matilda, a house robot] (pictured, left) weighs something like 70 kg, and she's got a flipper at the front and a circular sword at the back, which is made out of hardox, which is the stuff they make tanks out of. The four house robots are really quite serious. The contestant robots vary in size; none of them are quite as big as that but they're all pretty powerful.
Why do you think the BBC wanted to bring Robot Wars back?
They wanted a big family entertainment show and I think when they asked us if it was available, Alan Tyler – acting head of entertainment for the BBC – said he always knew about it so he asked us what we thought. And then we went in and pitched this new version of how we would update it.
How is this different from BattleBots, because that also involves dueling robots.
That's dueling robots [but] they don't have house robots. We have house robots. They treat it more as a sports show; we treat it more as an entertainment show, and we have house robots that become the big center villains and characters of the piece.
Will you take the format to different territories?
We'd like to. We'd love to use our Glasgow location as a hub so other territories can come in and shoot their version in our hub. We'd love another BBC series to shoot there. That's the idea.
Has there been any interest in the U.S.?
Within the group, we have A. Smith & Co. and they're pitching out of the U.S.
AUSTRALIA spends 20 times more money on subsidising negatively geared property than funding start-up businesses and this could cost us jobs and our economic future, one senior financial analyst says.
Ivor Ries, a Morgan's stockbroking firm analyst, said one of the greatest weaknesses in the Australian economy was the lack of investment in infrastructure and early stage businesses.
“We are miles behind places like the US in financing young, growth businesses. We're pathetic really compared with the US,” he told the ABC this week.
He said about $250 million was available in venture capital for young entrepreneurs each year. This was about 20 times less than what taxpayers spent subsidising investment properties, which do not create jobs.
“We currently give $4 billion a year to investors via the tax system to subsidise people buying negatively geared rental accommodation,” he told news.com.au.
Mr Ries said Australia was basically a country that subsidised nonproductive capital.
“If someone borrows money to buy residential property, it doesn't create any jobs,” he said.
“We're giving already well-off people subsidies to buy more property, whereas the country in total spends $250 million a year on venture capital. There's something wrong with that balance.”
It also meant that Australia was basically “exporting jobs”.
“It just means there will be fewer jobs here in the longer term. We're just exporting jobs at the moment,” he said.
The money spent on venture capital was even less than the $1 billion Australians spent buying luxury sports utility vehicles (SUVs) every year. A high proportion of these vehicles will be used as private cars but written off as a business asset, which the taxpayer pays for.
“The reality of life in Australia today is we subsidise people buying high-end SUVs but we don't give as much to venture capital,” Mr Ries said.
Mr Ries said the tax system should be tilted back towards things that actually created wealth and jobs. He saw at least two businesses a week that had developed some fantastic technology but could not get funding.
“I'll give them a list of 25 venture capital funds in Australia and I will say to them, ‘Don't expect to get any money out of them because they are fully committed' and I think any small business that's got great new technology, or a great new business idea in Australia at the moment is probably getting that advice from multiple sources around the country,” he told the ABC.
“We just don't have the capacity to fund these businesses at the moment.”
If Australians did start investing in venture capital at the same rate the US did, spending would jump from $250 million to $4.9 billion a year.
The risk of not doing this could condemn the country to low employment growth and a sticky unemployment rate, which is hovering about 6 per cent.
“These businesses are the Apples and Facebooks of tomorrow, they end up employing tens of thousands of people, and basically those businesses don't get off the ground in Australia,” Mr Ries said.
Instead they went mostly to the US, where they were 20 times more likely to find funding, but also to Europe and Asia.
“They start up those businesses there, and they create new industries and new revenue streams for the governments in those economies. So we're not just losing jobs, we're actually losing future government revenue,” Mr Ries said.
He said more tax concessions should be made available.
“I think the government needs to make it much more attractive to invest in these things which, by their nature, are much more risky,” he told news.com.au.
“Nine out of 10 of them will fail but the one that succeeds will often be hugely successful.”
Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens said on Wednesday that Australia's future prosperity would depend on raising the economy's growth potential.
“Our collective ability to deliver social policy outcomes, to enjoy the benefits of a good society, or at a more basic level to provide public services and even to defend ourselves, ultimately rests on a productive economy,” he said.
“We all know that competitive markets, investment in education, skills and infrastructure, and adaptability, are key parts of that growth narrative.”
Almost every witch, shaman, or spirit worker I know talks about working with their Ancestors. Some magicians do it. Polytheists, if they don't work directly with their Ancestors, usually have ways in which they honor them. But me? I'm terribly conflicted.
See, I understand the theory behind most Ancestor veneration and spirit work. It reminds me a lot of the tradition of Saints in Catholicism. Why not send up a prayer to some one who is invested in my well being and has experience in a certain area? Why not reach out to the Beloved Dead? I can't think of a single religious tradition that doesn't somehow honor their dead.
I, too, honor my Ancestors. I have a section of my altar set aside for Ancestors and Mighty Dead. In that corner is a sugar skull, pictures of Victor and Cora Anderson and my namesake (my maternal grandmother), a black glass votive candle, and a ramekin of water, which I clean and refill on every dark moon. I regularly wave incense and on Thursdays I honor my Teachers, Guru and Godsoul, which involves the Andersons. My Godsoul, too, is part of my Ancestors.
Every Samhain I honor the Mighty Dead and beloved family members. My family has a dumb supper and we create a special altar on the dining table. Some years I feel more pulled to honor some relatives more than others, but there are a few who are always present.
So I'm not entirely ignoring my Ancestors. I'm honoring them, but I am not working with them. Why not, you may be asking. Here is my list of excuses.
Firstly, I've never been one to see or hear the Dead. I've known a couple people, who without any formal practice or religion of their own, have had innate abilities to see and hear the Dead. I can tell you that I do not envy them! I have rarely had a knocking in my skull from my Ancestors.
Secondly, I don't know much about my most of my ancestors. I come from highly adventurous stock, but few of the stories I got straight from the source. I had limited interaction with my grandparents: one had a stroke before I was born and was basically the mean guy in the corner at family gatherings, one lived on the other side of the world (literally), my namesake died when my mother was a child, and one never really spoke all that much. While I have a basic grasp on my family tree thanks to an interest in genealogy as a teen, I don't have stories or close relations. Of course, this might be all the more reason to strike up a conversation with them now! But that leads me to my next point.
What make anyone so sure my ancestors are interested in me and my life? Some of them weren't so interested when they were alive, so why assume they feel differently now that they're dead? What about those who were Christian? Maybe they are hanging out with Jesus and don't want to enable their devil loving kin?
Fourthly, I don't know what to offer them. Many traditions seem to offer similar things: incense, various forms of alcohol, smoke in various forms, flowers, and so on. I don't know what things my ancestors liked. I offer water and incense. At Samhain I offer a few things: hot buttered tea to Victor (I heard he liked that), pie for Cora, a shot of something strong for my friend Tim, and some water and wine for the others, just to cover my bases. What if they were teetotalers? Ack.
You can see that my Ancestor work is fairly generic. However, several times a year I feel a prod to dig deeper, particularly regarding my namesake. Her death left painful, unresolved scars on my family. I am now older than she was at her death. I often wonder if more direct work with her could bring some healing to my family. Something feels very unresolved here, but I just don't know where to begin.
Yes, a good beginning would be sitting with her. I feel overwhelmed at the thought of having yet another spirit to sit with. You know, more sitting in all the quiet, uninterrupted time I have with three kids! But there's no other way forward, is there? Nothing is more effective for a beginning than just….. beginning.
I might want to get started. Samhain isn't too far off.
(I am wide open for advice if anyone wants to chime in!)
WASHINGTON — At a meeting at the White House with Democratic congressional leadership Saturday afternoon, President Obama said he would oppose any compromise deal on the expiring Bush tax cuts if it lacked help for the unemployed and other provisions designed to aid the middle class.
Speaking with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Cali.) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) shortly after the Senate failed to pass his preferred tax cut package proposal, Obama drew sharp lines in the sand with respect to ongoing negotiations.
"The President told Democratic Congressional leaders today that he was open to compromise, but he would oppose even a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts if it did not include an extension of benefits for the unemployed and extensions of the other tax cuts that benefit middle class families," a White House official told the Huffington Post. "Without them, taxes would still rise for 95 percent of Americans."
The official did not have specifics as to what period of time the president would find acceptable for an extension of unemployment benefits. Nor is it clear if the president would be fine with those benefits being offset while tax cut extension remains unpaid for. Among the "other tax cuts" that the president is demanding is the Make-Work-Pay tax credit and "a bunch of others expire at the end of the year."
The remarks are, nevertheless, one of the clearest signs that the president is not only done ceding any more policy turf to the GOP with respect to tax cut negotiations but willing to let rates expire if Republican don't temper their demands.
Said one person with knowledge of what was discussed: "This was the kind of signal that the Hill has been looking for." The question, the person added, is "when is the president going to make this announcement and how is he going to do it."

The 15 per cent foreign buyer tax introduced by the provincial Liberals as a way to cool off British Columbia's record-breaking housing market will soon be lifted for people who hold work permits and are paying taxes, according to Premier Christy Clark.
The announcement came during an impromptu reporters scrum before Sunday's Lunar New Year Parade in Vancouver's Chinatown.
“We believe the best and the brightest should be able to come to British Columbia, we're going to lift the foreign owners tax on people who have work permits, who are paying taxes and living in B.C. as a way to encourage more people to come,” Clark said.
Clark added the legislation gives the provincial government the ability to change the foreign tax to exempt groups of people.
“We will be exempting workers who have work permits who are foreigners who want to buy a home but will be paying their taxes and living in British Columbia,” she continued.
The foreign buyer tax came into effect on Aug. 2, and only purchases on the treaty lands of the Tsawwassen First Nation were exempt from the tax.
While succeeding in cooling the housing market and decreasing foreign speculation, the tax drew criticism for preventing non-Canadians living and working in B.C. from being able to afford a home.
The province says more information regarding the decision will be released soon, with the exemptions going into effect fairly quickly.
Not that we had serious doubts about the Wall Street Journal's report, but it's nice to get confirmation of Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside's departure. Less than two years after taking over the position from Sanjay Jha, who ran the company before the Google acquisition, Woodside is stepping down to become the first COO of Dropbox. The move comes just weeks after the announcement that Lenovo would be taking Moto off of Google's hands. It also raises questions about the future direction of the brand which shifted its focus towards affordability and customization over the last year, even if Woodside assures that Motorola management "remains focused on our current strategy." Obviously there is still work to be done during the transition from one owner to another, so Jonathan Rosenberg who has been Senior Vice President of Product will be stepping in as COO of Motorola to work with the rest of the leadership team.
NBA All-Star 2013: Why James White Is Going To Win The Sprite Slam Dunk Contest
NBA All-Star 2013: Why James White Is Going To Win The Sprite Slam Dunk Contest by Chris Walder
You can add the San Antonio Spurs to the laundry list of teams that are looking to make a run at Atlanta Hawks forward Josh Smith.
Just like the Energizer Bunny, these rumors keep going and going and going….
According to a report by Yahoo Sports, the Spurs are showing interest in possibly making a deal with Atlanta to acquire Smith.
The Spurs are among the teams with interest in Hawks forward Josh Smith, a source told Yahoo! Sports. Keep in mind, Hawks general manager Danny Ferry was previously with the Spurs.
The Dallas Mavericks, Phoenix Suns, Detroit Pistons and Brooklyn Nets have all been linked to Smith in possible trades that may occur before the February 21st deadline.
Through 47 games in the 2012-13 season, Josh is averaging 17.1 points, 8.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.3 steals in 35.8 minutes per contest.
The Spurs are currently the only team in the NBA with at least 40 wins with a record of 41-12, which is best in the entire league.
Smith is reportedly seeking a max contract, which is something the Hawks are not inclined to give him.
If San Antonio does make a deal for Josh, it's up in the air as to whether or not he would re-sign with the team, as he's eligible to become an unrestricted free-agent at the end of the season. He's currently in the final year of his contract, which is paying him $13.2 million.
Even so, do the Spurs really need him at this point?
Their current record speaks for itself, but when the playoffs roll on through, it's a completely different story.
San Antonio was bounced from the Western Conference Finals last season by the Oklahoma City Thunder, so having a guy like Josh Smith on the roster to combat an offensive weapon like Kevin Durant on the defensive end would be absolutely huge.
If the Spurs want to get back to the NBA Finals, they would undoubtedly need to go through Oklahoma City to do so.
I don't see them taking on Josh if he's only going to be around for one playoff run. There would need to be some sort of guarantee that Smith would re-sign and be around for the long haul.
I truly believe that the Spurs are fine just the way they are, and that Josh Smith wouldn't give them any better a shot at winning a championship than if they were to keep their roster intact past the deadline and make due with what they already have.
Atlanta isn't going to just give Josh up without demanding a lot in return. The $10 million dollar expiring contract of Stephen Jackson would be a valuable trade chip, but the Hawks would certainly ask for some young pieces as well, which may include the likes of Tiago Splitter and/or Kawhi Leonard.
It wouldn't be worth it at that point.
The “Big Three” of Duncan/Ginobili/Parker won't be around forever, so R.C Buford and the Spurs organization may go all in on a guy like Smith in order to achieve one more championship before that era comes to a close.
If trading for Josh Smith means too many important core pieces get sent packing in the process, then I don't see how that benefits the Spurs this season and beyond.
The best team in the NBA breaking up their roster at midseason doesn't make sense.

Martin and Aoife are in Japan for the Tokyo Game Show this week, and they spent their first day exploring the city's arcade scene, as well as paying their respects to Akihabara's retro gaming temple, Super Potato. Below you'll find a video podcast they recorded about their jaunt, plus seasoned arcade-watcher Martin's thoughts about the current state of Japanese arcades.
Are Japanese arcades getting their groove back? In all honesty, they never really lost it - it's just that the beat of more mainstream Japanese arcades has changed so substantially in recent years, it's been hard for visiting outsiders to appreciate what's happened and how they've evolved. There's an ideal of the Japanese arcade - the one where hundreds of candy cabinets are lined up, all playing curios and half-remembered treasures from our youth - that's been sidelined to multi-storey affairs in Akihabara, places where older players can go and reminisce while sinking 100 yen coins in well preserved classics. The game stations of Taito and Sega, though, which crop up in busy hubs like Shibuya and Shinjuku, have become stranger, more alienating places, where indecipherably dense games like Border Break and Lords of Vermillion make it hard for travelling tourists to get a hold on what makes these places special.
Over the past five years, when I've been lucky enough to spend time in Japan courtesy of Eurogamer for the Tokyo Game Show, I've become increasingly dejected about the arcade scene: Shibuya Kaikan Monaco, a smoky dive where all the yellowed candy cabinets asked for only 50 yen in exchange for a run at the finest collection of fighters and shmups, was an amazing discovery the first year, but in 2013 the shutters were drawn and now the building's been completely demolished. It seemed indicative of the whole scene. Finding traditional games in places like Club Sega or Taito Game Station has been harder and harder, with UFO catchers taking up more and more space while even the larger venues themselves seem to be dwindling in number.
So what's changed this year? Part of it's been showing our own Aoife Wilson around favourite haunts on her first visit to Tokyo, and being able to see it all through fresh eyes again. But a larger part of it is how much more accessible it all seems now. Pokken Tournament, Namco's pugilistic take on one of Japan's most globally renowned franchises, Pokémon, has now rolled out across arcades, and who doesn't want to get involved in some hot Pikachu versus Charizard action? (Me, actually, seeing as Aoife tore my Pikachu to shreds.) There's something refreshingly open-armed and inclusive about this fighter, in its use of a bulky gamepad over an arcade stick and in its simple inputs, with its combat all about stringing together specials and spacing in the small circular arenas it provides.
There are other recognisable names too. Luigi's Mansion Arcade, a re-tooling of Nintendo's offbeat ghost-catching series by Capcom, finds itself a place in most venues, and enjoyably odd it is too. It's not the most nuanced of games - the assets seem to be lifted directly from the 3DS game and given a little polish so they don't look too out of place on the colossal screen your nose almost scrapes against - but that doesn't really matter when you're given your own bulky plastic Poltergust 3000 to ensnare spirits, flashing lights to temporarily stun them before wrestling them in.
Elsewhere, it's disappointing that Street Fighter 5 has yet to make its way to location tests - how strange it is to have sampled Capcom's latest in my own living room a couple of weeks ago and to come to Tokyo and find it entirely absent from the scene that birthed it. Telling, too, that one of the most iconic arcade games is now leading with console - although Tekken 7, which is currently pulling in big numbers a few months after its release over here, seems happy to fill the void.
Pokken Tournament's controller is something of a curio - a traditional game pad tied to an impressive cabinet.
None of that's what's made me fall for Japanese arcades all over again, though: it's the rediscovery of an old staple I've been too blinkered in my pursuit of a Xexex or a Salamander to fully appreciate in the past. A new wave of rhythm action games, spearheaded by Sega's relatively seasoned Maimai and its more recent contender Chuntithm, place the contemporary Japanese arcade in its best light: as a brilliantly social space, where friends can get together and dick around to the strains of some of the most infectious J-Pop around. It helps that some of that J-Pop's familiar even to an outsider like me, with Persona's hyper-lounge providing a large chunk of the soundtrack. Going for a one-credit run in Thunder Cross 2 is one thing; necking a couple of cans of umeshu, getting lost in impossibly high energy music and then hitting the purikura is quite another, even if it's not particularly becoming of a man in his thirties.
What I really love about it, though, is stepping back and witnessing the mad theatre of it all: seeing a scrawny kid in his early 20s sink a couple of credits, pull on a pair of white gloves and take on a mean stance before unleashing all kinds of havoc on a Maimai cabinet, his wild dance choreographed by the flashing lights of the machine. High-level rhythm action play will always command a special space in my heart (there are few greater sights in gaming than seeing friend of Eurogamer and Kotaku UK editor Keza MacDonald take down a Jubeat cabinet at full force), and I adore how it takes something so often perceived as casual and makes it utterly, resolutely hardcore. It's something Japan's always excelled at, thinking about it, and what a rush to discover that's as true now as ever before in Tokyo's arcades.
This proof of principle study is the first demonstration that a psychological manipulation designed to reduce psychological threat appraisals in vulnerable populations can prevent endothelial damage provoked by psychological stress. In addition to corroborating our earlier finding that this form of stress dynamically elevates circulating EMPs [17]—a biological marker of endothelial damage and apoptosis—we now show that a brief psychological inoculation designed to alter the appraisal of stress eliminates this effect. Together, these findings show that psychological events related to one's social and interpersonal setting have immediate and direct influences on vascular health. These findings were paralleled by consistent and predicted ones with salivary cortisol and self-report psychological stress measures, serving as manipulation checks.
Conceptually, values affirmation engages social cognitive processes that likely originate in higher cortical areas related to the construction of self-concept [35], appraisals of self-worth and social standing [36], and working memory [37]. Priming negative social, cultural, or racial associations that threaten one's self-concept—a process known as stereotype threat [38]—has long been thought to impair performance. The active psychological ingredients of our SET challenge likely involved similar threats to self-concept, as it has been shown to activate areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex [31, 35, 39] important for stress [31, 38], appraisals of self-concept [40, 41], social standing [36], and emotional meaning [35]. Our findings extend the concepts of stereotype threat and SET into physiological systems directly relevant for health. The psychological effects on endothelial health we describe here may be mediated by autonomic control of vascular performance and regulation. This is consistent with other studies of self-affirmation that have shown effects on autonomic and neuroendocrine responses to stressful tasks [18, 19]. By linking the effects of stress and self-affirmation to factors directly relevant for incident cardiovascular disease risk, the current findings provide new bridges between psychological science and medical science or mind-brain-body connections.
We note some important limitations of this study. First, it may be asked whether actual and irreversible endothelial injury occurred in our study. Although we use the term endothelial injury throughout this report, free circulating EMPs arguably are characterized more precisely as markers of endothelial damage. As for the duration of the effect, like many aspects of routine daily living, the Trier Social Stress Test is believed to have produced small but reversible damage to the endothelium and not permanent damage. What remains critical for future research is to understand the cumulative effects of many such instances, i.e., those that lead to measurable changes in health.
Similarly, whether exaggerated acute reactivity of endothelial function predicts long-term damage is also unknown. Several studies demonstrate that various markers of endothelial dysfunction are associated with an increased risk of subclinical cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease events [4]. These studies assessed markers of endothelial function at rest and did not consider the level of stress that each individual was experiencing at the time of the assessment. In addition, studies have demonstrated acute negative effects of various probes—e.g., a high fat meal, acute mental stress, smoking a cigarette—on endothelial function; however, these effects have not been linked to longer-term outcomes. Therefore, it is unclear whether stress-induced endothelial dysfunction predicts subclinical cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease events. Moreover, our study was conducted with healthy individuals, and it could be that those at risk for cardiovascular disease have more prolonged effects. This is another important area of future research.
Second, the values affirmation intervention produced acute, short-term changes in this study. The long-term effects of the intervention on physiology are largely unknown, though there appear to be advantageous long-term effects on academic performance [21, 42] and health [42]. Therefore, its viability as a stress inoculation treatment with respect to cardiovascular health remains unknown.
Third, these data are considered preliminary due to the relatively small sample size. They serve as a proof of principle, providing a promising foundation for future larger-scale investigations. At the same time, it should be noted that within small samples, robust effect sizes can be found (as in the case of the current study), whereas small effect sizes rarely reach significance. Thus, such significant findings should be interpreted with caution in particular when determining power for future studies [43]. However, overestimation of effect sizes is often related to: (1) multiple testing and picking the “winning” tests, (2) altering the analyses, e.g., by changing covariates included or median splits on individual difference variables until significance is obtained, and (3) increasing the sample size until significance is reached and then stopping. The current study did not implement any of these problematic approaches.
Finally, future work should characterize the mind-brain-body connections implicated in the current study. For example, self-affirmation of values in the face of threatening information is thought to have multiple potential psychological effects, including boosting self-resources, broadening perspective, and decoupling the individual from the threat (cf. Sherman and Hartson [28]). It is possible that any or all of these psychological processes could have downstream effects on physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease, with multiple potential mediating brain-peripheral pathways.
As the 2013 NFL Draft moved past the Indianapolis Colts at the 23rd pick in the first round the Denver Broncos war room took a stance. They had fielded at least one phone call to trade back and that phone call led to an offer on the table for the 28th overall pick in the first round.
They hadn't considered at this point trading up, though situations where Denver would trade up had been discussed prior to the draft. Elway stated in his post first round draft conference that, "By the time it came [close] to our pick, we felt good, [Xavier] Rhodes was still up there, [Datone] Jones was still up there and [Sylvester] Williams was still up there."
However, there were three players that the team coveted and one was about to leave the board, gone at 25th overall was cornerback Xavier Rhodes to the Minnesota Vikings and at 26th overall defensive end Datone Jones was drafted by the Green Bay Packers. The 27th pick belonged to the Houston Texans and Elway's good friends Gary Kubiak and Wade Phillips were in on the decision.
Had the Texans gone with defensive tackle Sylvester Williams from North Carolina, the Broncos likely would have ended up with the same or a similar deal that the Minnesota Vikings gave to the New England Patriots to move up to number 29 (a second (No. 52 overall), third (No. 83 overall), fourth (No. 102 overall) and a seventh (No. 229 overall)) and not made a pick until the second round.
However, the Texans went with wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins at 28 and Denver made Sylvester Williams their first round selection.
So a trade back and possibly out of the first was no longer a possibility, because as Elway continued, "As things started playing out, it started looking like we were going to end up with a pretty good football player."
And they did.
About
The Military Mind
The Military Mind is a documentary that takes a hard look at the culture of the United States military and its impact on the mental health of soldiers. Recent estimates suggest that 20-25% of soldiers who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or related mental conditions. More soldiers have committed suicide so far in 2012 than have been killed in Afghanistan, and more than 6,500 veterans commit suicide every year. What we are seeing is an epidemic unlike any since the Vietnam War, and the response from the military and the US government has been nothing short of inadequate.
The culture that exists within our military today is one that is oppressive and to many soldiers, traumatizing. This is a culture that brands emotional trauma as weakness and frowns heavily on seeking psychological help. It is a culture that trains soldiers to override their internal instinct to avoid hurting and killing other human beings, but fails to train them how to return to normal life after war. It is a culture that actively engages in "blaming the victim," demeaning and demoralizing those who are unable to mentally withstand the horrors of war.
The rates of PTSD and suicide that we are experiencing should be a national outrage, but in reality they are topics that garner little public attention. Due to the economic recession, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have fallen significantly out of the public spotlight. The War in Afghanistan has quietly become the longest war in US history. The War in Iraq sits in second place. These are also the first major wars that the US has fought since the US ended the draft in 1973, meaning that we rely on an all-volunteer force and require many soldiers to endure multiple deployments.
Soldiers who suffer from PTSD are facing a system that provides little assistance and a general public that has failed to grasp the significance of the problem. It can take many months, and in some cases, years, for a soldier to be granted approval by the Department of Veteran Affairs to begin receiving treatment and disability benefits. And even if a soldier is diagnosed with PTSD, they are still responsible for proving that it was caused by their military service. Many soldiers are denied because the military does not see a valid connection. There are nearly 1 million veterans who are currently waiting for care from the VA.
The VA is severely underfunded, but that is not the only issue. We need to see a much greater emphasis on therapy and less of a reliance on medication, as well as greater focus on preventative measures. There are also many alternative methods of therapy that have been very helpful to veterans, but are not being employed by the VA.
With this film, we will share the stories of these brave men and women and call attention to the system that is failing them. If we can convince the public to rally around this issue, the military will be forced to finally pay attention to it.
Please consider making a contribution, even if it's a small amount. Your donation will help to bring this issue into the national spotlight.
We need to stand up together and demand a change. We owe this to our troops.
Best,

NRL players' brains shown to be more damaged than brains of non-players, says neuroscientist
Updated
There is growing evidence that repeated concussions to rugby league players have a long-term effect, says neuroscientist Dr Alan Pearce.
Key points: The study found former players had worse memories and reaction times
A 2015 rule change said players suspected of having a concussion had to undergo formal head injury assessment
Over the weekend two players were allowed to play without proper checks after getting knocked down
Dr Pearce, from La Trobe University, recently completed a study comparing 25 former NRL players now aged in their fifties to 25 men of a similar age.
The men carried out cognitive tests to measure their memory and attention spans, as well as motor tests for things like reaction time and fine dexterity.
"What I've found is that the responses of retired rugby league players was significantly different to the healthy controls with no history of head injury," Dr Pearce said.
"That also correlated to the tests of cognition and motor reaction times, that were significantly worse."
Dr Pearce hopes the results could be used to start a rehabilitation program, using neuroplasticity to try and help players recover damaged brain functions.
Basically they would help participants' brains to become "rewired", and improve their memory and motor functions.
"We have seen that in other areas, such as stroke and Parkinson's, where you do exercise therapy, we do get some improvement," Dr Pearce said.
Dr Pearce will be presenting his new study next week in the US at the 12th World Congress of Brain Injury.
The study is timely, given a lawsuit lodged last month by ex-NRL player James McManus suing his former club Newcastle over its handling of his concussions.
Brendan Elliott, Josh Dugan play on despite knock
Over the weekend Newcastle Knights fullback Brendan Elliot was allowed to keep playing after a serious head knock in the first half against Souths.
The first hit to Elliot came about 25 minutes into the game and despite the fact that he lay on the ground for several minutes, he was not given a head injury assessment and was allowed to play on.
Twenty minutes into the second half he went down again and was taken off the field.
Dr Pearce said a formal assessment should have taken place.
"I was pretty surprised that they would allow him to stay on after the first impact," he said.
"Because he was obviously concussed, because when he fell you could actually see that he wasn't trying to guard himself.
"He already obviously had effects of concussion before he hit the ground."
The NRL is also examining a second incident from the weekend that involved Dragons player Josh Dugan, who went down after being elbowed in the jaw by a teammate.
After the game, Dragons coach Paul McGregor defended the decision to keep Dugan playing, saying "it was his jaw, not a head injury."
Dr Pearce said that explanation defied logic.
"When I did my anatomy the jaw was part of the head," he said.
"We know that with any sort of repetitive head injury you don't have to have a direct hit to the head to have effects of concussion.
"Even indirect hits can very violently move the brain, can affect the neurons or the cells of the brain."
Medical staff 'doing the best job they can'
NRL rules around concussion were changed in 2015, and state that players must undergo a formal head injury assessment if they are suspected of having a concussion.
But that did not appear to happen with either Dugan or Elliot.
However, Dr Pearce said that for the most part the NRL was doing a good job and there were "plenty of examples where the policy has been put in place."
"Obviously at the microscope of the community and the media looking at what happens every time, and if one gets missed it is highlighted very clearly," he said.
"The medical staff are doing the best job they can, and sometimes what happens is that they're distracted looking at other players, trying to multi-task.
"And so I think that it's possible that one or two will always slip through the net."
The ABC contacted the NRL for comment but no one was available for an interview.
In a statement it said "The NRL reviews all concussions and head injury assessments (HIA's)."
"The NRL says it's looking at a number of incidents from the weekend including the cases of Josh Dugan and Brendan Elliott."

Wednesday, January 22 will mark the 41st anniversary of Roe v. Wade: a 7 to 2 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that found a woman's right to an abortion fell within the right to privacy protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Justices' decision invalidated all state laws restricting access to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. They also said states were allowed to regulate second trimester abortions in ways related to maternal health, and permitted third trimester abortion restrictions, including the ability of states to outlaw them.
Since this unjust and immoral decision there have been numerous debates over abortion and the definition of human life. Polls continue to show cultural divide over the issue with a greater percentage moving towards the pro-life position. In 2011, 92 measures to protect life were enacted in 24 states. The following year, 43 pro-life bills were enacted in 19 states. And in 2013, 70 new bills in 22 states increased protections for women and the preborn in the womb. Moreover, 20 states so far have restricted abortion coverage through the state health insurance exchanges mandated by the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). These events prompted an unexpected proclamation by Time Magazine a year ago that “The Pro-Life movement is winning.”
The March for Life in our nation's capital began on January 22, 1974 and marked the first anniversary of Roe v. Wade. That first March for Life rallied around 20,000 people on the west steps of the U.S. Capitol Building. An estimated 225,000 marched on the 25th anniversary in 1998, and last year on the 40thanniversary it was estimated that over a half million people gathered in the National Mall to show their opposition to the murder of the most innocent of the human family — the preborn child.
Although it is consistently unreported by the national news media, the March for Life in D.C. has annually grown in size, influence and in public recognition. One of the most noticeable characteristics about the rally is the age and gender of the participants. A greater number of young people, particularly women, are actively engaged in the debate. They are passionate, vocal and dedicated to the defense of human life; they believe that abortion is morally wrong and bad for our society. Polls reveal that 53% of those between the ages of 18 and 34 consider abortion morally wrong with estimates of 24% and higher believing abortion is wrong in all circumstances. These numbers are far from what we can call a victory, but clearly, the tide is shifting.
I have seen firsthand — domestically and internationally — the growing number of young people engaged in the debate about human life and its defense from its earliest moments. One key ingredient in this debate, in my opinion, is the growth in science and technology that is assisting in a deeper appreciation of nascent life, particularly ultrasounds. The clarity of the images is undeniable and has debunked the “glob of tissue” or “clump of cells” lies that are still used to confuse women into committing a terrible and irreversible act. It is the game changer in the debate about the humanity of the preborn child. We are — as we have always been — talking about babies. Abortion is not about a mere choice or medical procedure; it is about the destruction of a developing human being.
Since the murderous onslaught of legalized abortion in our nation, we have seen the death of over 50 million babies. International figures are close to 50 million killed per year. The bloodshed is unimaginable and unconscionable.
At times when I feel weary from the battle, I reflect on the pro-life movement's many victories. Since 1973, we have won many battles on local, state and federal levels. We have continued to positively influence how people think about abortion and the dignity of human life. We have saved countless lives from the murderous hands of abortionists — mothers and babies — through sidewalk counseling and interventions. We have successfully challenged the dehumanizing language of “choice” to the point where NARAL and Planned Parenthood are looking for new words to hide the ongoing assault. Young people are joining our ranks by the thousands. Public opinion is shifting as we expose the illusion of abortion portrayed by its promoters. And in the backlash over the unjust HHS contraceptive/abortifacient mandate, many women are recognizing the threat contraception and abortion pose to them and their legitimate health. Societies around the world are waking up to the heinous consequences of the anti-life agenda.
The promoters of abortion know there is a shift in the tide; however, they will not give up their agenda so easily. They are determined, and for the moment occupy the highest positions of media and the government. What unites the pro-life movement is truth and devotion to the dignity of every human life. In conclusion, I ask you to consider the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who, in his famousLetter from the Birmingham Jail, challenged all Americans to actively but peacefully oppose laws that were morally wrong:
There are just laws and there are unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that an unjust law is no law at all … One who breaks an unjust law must do it openly, lovingly … I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and willingly accepts the penalty by staying in jail to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the very highest respect for law.
Following St. Augustine, King knew that secular laws must be in harmony with God's law, which directs us all to our ultimate destiny in Him. Without this understanding of how to order society, law is an arbitrary demand of the powerful, and has no call on a well-formed conscience.
As we gather around the nation to denounce the unjust and immoral decision ofRoe v. Wade, I pray that we have the courage to persevere in our quest for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for every human life.

Meze has been kind enough to lend me a pair of the 99 Neo for review; priced at 250USD, I like it, despite a couple small flaws. Being a closed full-size headphone with an impedance of 26 ohms and a sensitivity of 103dB/mW, they are clearly designed to be used on the go, and will be reviewed based on their performance driven from my iPhone 6S.
Included with the headphones themselves is a portably short cable with a 1 button remote, a quarter inch adapter, an airline adapter, and a fantastic travel case. The removable cable attaches to the headphones via dual 3.5mm mono connectors. The cable feels fantastically built, being kevlar-reinforced below the y-split, and flowing nicely, with no kinks or bends. Above the very nice y-split, the cable becomes rubbery, but remains very straight. The headphones themselves feel quite solid, with two metal bands as a headband structure, and sturdy black plastic cups. The headband itself is an AKG-esque suspension strap, with a little bit of padding, which leaves the top of your head without any undue pressure. The earpads are made of a supple memory-foam filled pleather, which my only complaint against is that they are just a little bit too shallow, causing my ears to press up against the plastic behind the pads, which can get painful after a while. I have heard of people putting HM5 pads on these, which would certainly fix this singular comfort issue, however, as to not risk damaging the earpads, I did not try this. The case is quite solid, and presents Meze's stylish logo beautifully. The case is solid enough that I would trust it to keep the 99 Neos safe even when haphazardly thrown into a bag. Overall, this is a well built product, which feels like it would easily last for many years.
The sound of the 99 Neos is decidedly warm in tonality, with a downward slope throughout the sound. Bass gets a a definitive lift in its entirety, though it does not overpower the rest of the track. I would not call it muddy, but it certainly lacks a little bit of definition, though it remains pleasant. The midrange also sounds pleasant, perhaps being this headphone's strongest point, with a gentle lift in the lower midrange relative to the upper mids, leaving them sounding relatively relaxed. Though, while relaxed, the midrange also sounds impressively clean. Vocals sound very accurate and defined, and plenty present, and never lost behind the bass. Instruments sound nicely defined, though slightly less than natural. The treble, while a little recessed, sounds plenty fast and detailed. Like the mids, the treble also sounds very clean. There seems to be a peak in the low to mid treble region, though this does not offend, instead bringing a bit more life to the sound. Soundstage, as these are closed, is not very wide, but is certainly wide enough that nothing sounds congested, and leaves enough room for the imaging, which is quite good. All in all, the sound of these is excellent, with little fault.
Now, there is one more issue I have with these, and that is noise. These make noise, or, rather, the headband makes noise when it moves. Whenever any part of the headband, save the pleather strap, is touched, its vibration is heard by the wearer. When you wear these, and are walking, the strap moves slightly, and this, too, is audible, if quieter than the headband noise. This issue, however, is far from a dealbreaker, as it is not very loud.
If Meze could fix the noise issue, and make the pads a little bit deeper, these would be nearly perfect for the price. These are going to be my go-to recommendation anywhere near this price point for a full-sized closed headphone.

Much of the headline-grabbing research about chimpanzees, humans' closest animal relatives, is framed in terms of how good chimps are at doing things we do. Well, here's a new finding on something those great apes trounce us at: recognising each other's butts.
They're good at this in the same way we people are at recognising individual faces. Unlike other common objects, we tell one face from another in a holistic way, processing the eyes, nose, lips and other features together. When we see images of faces turned upside-down, we're disproportionately worse at recognising them than we are at recognising, say, a flipped car.
This is called the "inversion effect,"and the authors of a new study in PLOS One found that chimpanzees have it when it comes to buttocks.
It was already known that chimps sometimes demonstrate an inversion effect with faces and bodies. But the researchers, based in the Netherlands and Japan, spotted a gap in the literature: "Previous studies included almost all body parts, except the most obvious one, which is the behind."

* Hamilton zoo welcomes new baby chimpanzee
Why would this be obvious? Because rear ends serve a big purpose in the chimp world. Female chimps' buttocks grow redder and swollen when they are ovulating, signalling to males that it's business time. And it's important to know whose bottom it is, in part to prevent inbreeding. The buttocks have, in scientific parlance, a "high socio-sexual signalling function".
But when we began walking upright, our bottoms became fleshier and no longer broadcast our ovulation status, possibly to discourage casual hook-ups in favour of pairing up and sticking together for the children's sake. On the other hand, humans - "especially females," the researchers write - developed ruddier and thicker lips, as well as fattier faces.
Bottoms and faces are both symmetrical, they add, and interpreting what a butt is saying is crucial to chimpanzees' reproductive success, just as interpreting facial messaging is important to human mating.
"Thus," the authors write, "human faces share important features with the ancient primate behind."
So their hypothesis was that the inversion effect would hit chimpanzees harder when it came to buttocks. And in tests - which involved 100 people and five chimpanzees who matched images and inverted images of human and primate faces, buttocks and feet - they found this to be the case. The humans struggled more to match upside-down faces than rear ends. The chimpanzees had the opposite problem, which suggests they process images of buttocks the way we do faces.
The researchers say it also suggests that when we began walking, our recognition abilities moved from the "bottom up" -- that is, that our facial identifying skills evolved out of an ancient ability to recognise specific buttocks.
"The findings suggest an evolutionary shift in socio-sexual signalling function from behinds to faces, two hairless, symmetrical and attractive body parts," the authors wrote, "which might have attuned the human brain to process faces, and the human face to become more behind-like."
Steve Spagnuolo has agreed to become the next defensive coordinator of the New Orleans Saints, according to a league source.
The former St. Louis Rams coach hasn't signed a contract, but it was expected to happen Thursday.

Spagnuolo became a coaching free agent when he was fired by the Rams on Jan 2.
Spagnuolo was defensive coordinator for the New York Giants for two seasons (2007-08) before coaching the Rams for the last three seasons, compiling a 10-38 record. He has an extensive defensive background, coaching on that side of the ball for eight seasons in Philadelphia under esteemed coordinator Jim Johnson.
The position in New Orleans became available when former coordinator Gregg Williams agreed to take the same position on Jeff Fisher's staff with the Rams, according to league sources. That didn't come as a surprise to Saints coach Sean Payton, who said Tuesday it was apparent before the season ended that Williams was likely to join Fisher.
Spagnuolo's Rams were one of three teams to beat the Saints during the 2011 regular season.
Spagnuolo's defense in St. Louis ranked 22nd this season, but the unit was stellar against New Orleans, sacking Drew Brees six times and intercepting him twice in the team's most lopsided loss of the season.
Before taking over in St. Louis, Spagnuolo had top-10 defenses with the Giants. His 2007 defense led the NFL with 53 sacks, and the 2008 unit was sixth in the league with 42.

George Roden (January 17, 1938 – December 6, 1998) was an American leader of the Branch Davidian sect, a Seventh-day Adventist splinter group. In 1987, he was evicted from the Mount Carmel Center near Waco, Texas by his rival David Koresh.[2] He was later confined in a Texas mental hospital for a 1989 murder, until his own death.
Branch Davidians [ edit ]
George Roden was the presumed successor to his mother Lois Roden, who had become president of the Branch Davidians in 1978, when her husband and group leader Benjamin Roden had died. However, Vernon Howell (after 1990, known as David Koresh) arrived at Mount Carmel and began a sexual relationship with Lois Roden who was then in her sixties.[3] Koresh justified their relationship by claiming that God had chosen him to father a child with her, who would be the Chosen One.[4] George Roden felt that his position of leadership was threatened and was deeply offended by Koresh's relationship with his mother. He would file a lawsuit in federal court alleging that Koresh had raped Lois and brainwashed her into turning against him.[3]
In 1984, Koresh left the compound for Palestine, Texas with the vast majority of the group's followers. Roden renamed Mount Carmel "Rodenville". In a videotaped interview Roden led a tour of "Rodenville" using an M1 carbine as a pointer and declared: "It's basically a holy jihad, Khomeini versus Israel, that's what Vernon Howell has with me."[5] Three years later, resentful of Koresh's power over the Davidians, Roden challenged Koresh, saying that whoever could resurrect the dead was the true leader. While Roden prayed over the body of Ana Hughes, who had died two decades earlier, Koresh reported Roden to the McLennan County sheriff's office for corpse abuse. The police told Koresh that he needed evidence to back up his accusation.[3]
On November 3, 1987, Koresh and seven followers returned to Mount Carmel heavily armed and wearing camouflage clothing. They stealthily entered the compound, allegedly to obtain a photograph. However they did not bring a camera, but carried weapons and a map of the grounds with positions to occupy. They found Roden crouched behind a tree with an Uzi submachine gun and a gun battle ensued for several minutes. Roden fled the property with wounds to his hand and chest. Koresh's compatriots were found not guilty after a two-week trial for attempted murder in Waco, and a mistrial was declared in Koresh's case. Their weapons, five .223-caliber semi-automatic rifles, two .22-caliber rifles and two 12-gauge shotguns, which had been confiscated by the police were returned as well.[6] The shoot out at Mount Carmel would be described by The New York Times as a foretelling of the violence of the Waco siege.[3]
Adair murder [ edit ]
Two years later in 1989, Roden killed his roommate (Wayman Dale Adair, 56) with an axe in Odessa, Texas, and claimed that the man had been sent by Koresh to kill him. Put on trial for murder, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, and confined to a state mental hospital in North Texas.[7]
Mental illness, escape and death [ edit ]
On September 30, 1993, Roden walked away from the Big Spring State Hospital and went missing for 10 days. The Big Spring Police Department was assisted in the search by the Odessa Police Department and the Texas Rangers. He was captured the next day in Abilene, Texas, and returned to Big Spring State Hospital by the Taylor County sheriff's department.[8] In February 1995, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation's Dangerous Review Board declared Roden "not manifestly dangerous". Seven months later, he fled Big Spring for three days before being caught outside the Israeli consulate in New York City, where he reportedly caused a disturbance after being denied a visa to Israel. Roden, who claimed to be Jewish, said hitmen trained by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) were trying to kill him.[9] On December 8, 1998, Roden again escaped and was found dead of a heart attack on the grounds of Big Spring State Hospital, where he was confined at the time.[10][11]

Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign, led by new attack dog Rudy Giuliani, alleged on Wednesday that Barack Obama lacked the chops to lead the country in the war on terror. The Illinois Democrat, aides declared, was more concerned for the legal rights of alleged terrorists than he was for the security of the American people.
"The remarks yesterday by several people in the Obama campaign that if bin Laden were taken to Guantanamo he would be given habeas corpus rights, is startling," said the former mayor.
Lost amidst the attacks was the question: what, exactly, would be so damaging should Osama bin Laden receive habeas corpus rights as a detainee? For the time being it is a moot point, as bin Laden has not been caught and the Supreme Court has ruled that, should he be brought to Guantanamo, he would be given these legal rights regardless of the president's disposition. McCain, should he become president, would have to abide by the ruling or disregard the Court and disrupt the constitutional separation of powers.
But the debate is a worthwhile one to examine, as it provides an indication of where each candidate stands on legal and war on terror prerogatives. Asked about the issue on a conference call following one by Giuliani, aides to Obama called it absurd, dismissing the notion that granting Osama bin Laden habeas rights would somehow weaken America's position against him.
"I have not doubted that there would be no problem establishing an evidentiary basis to hold Osama bin Laden," said adviser Greg Craig. Added Rep. Adam Smith: "Do Rudy Giuliani and others really think a court would look at Osama bin Laden and say you have no legal reason to hold him?"
Indeed, legal scholars are equally baffled at the argument that Supreme Court's recent decision hinders the broader war on terror.
"It would not mean that Osama bin Laden would be released," said David Cole, a professor at Georgetown University's law school. "It would simply mean that the government would have to justify his detention under the rule of law. And as Colin Powell himself said when the subject came up of closing Guantanamo and bringing people to the U.S... 'We should have no fear of justifying their detentions'... The right recognized by the Supreme Court is a fundamental one. It is only the right to go to court, it is not the right to be released unless the court concludes that there is no legal authority to continue to be detained. The whole argument that we wouldn't have a justification to keep Osama bin Laden legally detained is delusional."
Pressed to clarify their concern over granting habeas rights to detainees, McCain's aides acknowledged that there would be little to no chance that bin-Laden would win his freedom through legal loopholes. The problem, they warned, is that criminal trials would lead to the public airing of sensitive intelligence.
"I think maybe legislation working with the Congress, which would define more narrowly the habeas corpus rights of people who we have detained," McCain told CNN. "It's very broad right now. At least try to provide some definition of that so we're not ending up in endless lawsuits. Already the detainees have brought suit on diet, on reading material, on all kinds of other things that are certainly not central to what we have detained them for. So I would hope that we could at least do that."
McCain, his staff notes, views a military tribunal system as a method to protect sources while simultaneously providing an adequate system of judicial review.
But even that logic, observers say, is shaky. For starters, Obama never closed off the idea of utilizing military commission when properly formed - it was the Supreme Court which lost patience with the status quo at Guantanamo. Secondly, U.S. forces currently have the authority to kill bin Laden, making his judicial status a secondary concern. Mainly, however, the Supreme Court's decision only grants the right to ask for a habeas hearing, not a right to a any particular venue for a trial. Bin Laden, if he were captured and brought to Guantanamo, would only be able to challenge the status of his detention - legal scholars say - not force a case to trial.
Elon Musk is giving a keynote speech at the International Astronautical Congress today, with an hour-long talk titled “Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species.” The talk kicks off at 2:30 PM ET, and we'll be covering it to bring you all the details of Musk's plans to get humans to Mars (and beyond?).
Musk doesn't just want us to touch the face of these extraterrestrial spheres; his intent with SpaceX has been to create a viable way for humans to actually colonize other planets, and to live on Mars (and presumably, other suitable planets as well) sustainably, in the long-term.
SpaceX's Mars ambitions are no secret, as Musk has been discussing settling the red planet since at least 2012. The initial plan would be to use 10 people to set up a colony that could eventually grow to as many as 80,000, according his preliminary plan as sketched out back the.
A lot has happened since then, including SpaceX successfully running a number of Falcon 9 missions. More recently, Musk has also been teasing progress on the Mars front, first noting that the Mars Colonial Transporter “will need a new name” since it can go far beyond Mars, and then following that up with a test firing of the Raptor engine designed to propel the MCT.
The big questions we'll be looking to answer today revolve around the specific technical details of how Musk plans to get to and colonize Mars, and how he intends to pay for the tremendous, and likely very expensive undertaking. Watch along above, and be sure to stick around for our follow-up coverage of the news and analysis of what Musk reveals.
African farmers who are able to produce their own fertilizer from only air. Bhaskar S. Patil brings this prospect closer with a revolutionary reactor that coverts nitrogen from the atmosphere into NO x , the raw material for fertilizer. His method, in theory, is up to five times as efficient as existing processes, enabling farms to have a small-scale installation without the need for a big investment. He receives his doctorate on 10 May at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e).
The production of one of the key raw materials for fertilizer, ammonia (NH 3 ) or nitrogen oxide (NO x ), is a very energy-intensive process that is responsible for about 2% of all global CO 2 emissions. However, it is hardly possible any longer to cut the energy consumption via current production processes since the theoretically minimal feasible energy consumption has already been more or less reached.
Two types of reactor
So the Indian PhD candidate Patil sought alternative methods to produce ammonia and nitrogen oxides for his PhD research, building two types of reactor, the Gliding Arc (GA) reactor and the Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) reactor. In his experiments the GA reactor in particular appeared to be the most suited to producing nitrogen oxides. In this reactor, under atmospheric pressure, a plasma-front (a kind of mini lightning bolt) glides between two diverging metal surfaces, starting with a small opening (2 mm) to a width of 5 centimeters. This expansion causes the plasma to cool to room temperature. During the trajectory of the 'lightning', the nitrogen (N 2 ) and oxygen (O 2 ) molecules react in the immediate vicinity of the lightning front to nitrogen oxides (NO and NO 2 ).
Africa
Patil optimized this reactor and at a volume of 6 liters per minute managed to achieve an energy consumption level of 2.8 MJ/mole, quite an improvement on the commercially developed methods that use approximately 0.5 MJ/mole. With the theoretical minimum of Patil's reactor, however, being that much lower (0.1 MJ/mole), in the long term this plasma technique could be an energy-efficient alternative to the current energy-devouring ammonia and nitrate production. An added benefit is that Patil's method requires no extra raw materials and production can be generated on a small scale using renewable energy, making his technique ideally suited for application in remote areas that have no access to power grids, such as parts of Africa, for instance.
Stimulating growth of plants
The German Evonik Industries, who was involved in this research project, is right now working on the further development of the reactor. In addition, another PhD student at TU/e has begun elaborating this technology into a concrete business case. Apart from use at remote farms, this technique can also be used to stimulate the growth of plants in greenhouses and to store sustainable energy in liquid fuels.
The PhD research of Patil was financially supported by the EU MAPSYN consortium.
Cameroon's International Film Festival (CAMIFF) kicked off this week in Buea – the capital of the Southwest Region in the English speaking part of the country., This is coming after a three-month long internet shutdown which had left doubts over the success of the event.
The festival was launched on April 24 and is expected to promote the local film industry while developing corporation with other countries.
A recurring theme in films screened this year was women. An example is that of Cameroonian film ‘Kiss of Death' – about forced marriage, drew a lot of emotion and debate.
Lack of adequate finance and no cinemas are some of the challenges the film industry of the central African country is facing , but festivals like CAMIFF and another one called ‘Ecrans Noir' or Black Screen have shown that filmmakers here are steadfast despite difficulties.
“We created CAMIFF for the sole purpose of helping the film industry to attract content buyers because in Cameroon we have a very vibrant industry, the youths are very committed, the people are very committed and we also believe that the community love films but there are no structures to exploit these movies, I mean, no cinemas. All the cinema have been shut down within the 10 regions of Cameroon,” said Gilbert Agbor, CAMIFF organizer.
Some of the issues, participants hope to find lasting solutions to are piracy as well as a strategy to grow local and international appreciation for Cameroonian content.
Kim Kyong-hui, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's aunt and a key figure behind the throne, has not been seen in public for 80 days.
The 67-year old has not disappeared from public view for such a long time before since she resurfaced in June 2009, an informed source said. She is said to be suffering a variety of diseases.
She was last seen on May 12 alongside Kim Jong-un, his wife Ri Sol-ju, and Jang Song-taek, her husband and eminence grise behind the regime. They were watching a song-and-dance performance in Pyongyang.
But there was no sign of her at the rather more important memorial event at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun on July 8 on the 19th anniversary of nation founder Kim Il-sung's death.
Jang's public activities have also been drastically curtailed over the same period. He has been seen in public only three times since his wife's last public appearance on May 12.
This caused some speculation that the couple may have fallen victim to a purge, but it is more likely that his absence is related to his wife's deteriorating health.
"Even Ri Sol-ju has appeared in public only twice since May," the source added. "There is an intelligence report that she is nursing Kim Kyong-hui."
The rumors are likely to be fueled if she fails to attend massive celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Korean War armistice this Saturday.
Kim Kyong-hui has a history of depression and alcoholism, which got worse in the mid-2000s because of her discord with her husband and their daughter Jang Kum-song's suic ide in 2006. Even after her comeback as the head of the Workers Party's Light Industry Department after treatment and rehabilitation in June 2009, she reportedly suffered from lower back pain, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.
She appears to have aged fast after her brother, former leader Kim Jong-il, died in December 2011.
For GeForce cards with a model number of 7XX0, see GeForce 7 series
The GeForce 700 Series is a series of graphics processing units developed by Nvidia. While mainly a refresh of the Kepler microarchitecture (GK-codenamed chips), some cards use Fermi (GF) and later cards use Maxwell (GM). GeForce 700 series cards were first released in 2013, starting with the release of the GeForce GTX Titan on February 19, 2013, followed by the GeForce GTX 780 on May 23, 2013. The first mobile GeForce 700 series chips were released in April 2013.
Overview [ edit ]
GK110 has been designed and is being marketed with computational performance in mind. It contains 7.1 billion transistors. This model also attempts to maximise energy efficiency through the execution of as many tasks as possible in parallel according to the capabilities of its streaming processors.
With GK110, increases in memory space and bandwidth for both the register file and the L2 cache over previous models, are seen. At the SMX level, GK110's register file space has increased to 256KB composed of 65K 32bit registers, as compared to Fermi's 33K 32bit registers totaling 128 KB. As for the L2 cache, GK110 L2 cache space increased by up to 1.5MB, 2x as big as GF110. Both the L2 cache and register file bandwidth have also doubled. Performance in register-starved scenarios is also improved as there are more registers available to each thread. This goes in hand with an increase of total number of registers each thread can address, moving from 63 registers per thread to 255 registers per thread with GK110.
With GK110, Nvidia also reworked the GPU texture cache to be used for compute. With 48KB in size, in compute the texture cache becomes a read-only cache, specializing in unaligned memory access workloads. Furthermore, error detection capabilities have been added to make it safer for use with workloads that rely on ECC.[5]
This series support DirectX 12 on Windows 10.[6]
Dynamic Super Resolution (DSR) was added to Kepler GPUs with the latest Nvidia drivers.[7]
Architecture [ edit ]
The PCB of a GTX 780
The GeForce 700 Series contains features from both GK104 and GK110. Kepler based members of the 700 series add the following standard features to the GeForce family.
Derived from GK104 :
PCI Express 3.0 interface
DisplayPort 1.2
HDMI 1.4a 4K x 2K video output
Purevideo VP5 hardware video acceleration (up to 4K x 2K H.264 decode)
Hardware H.264 encoding acceleration block (NVENC)
Support for up to 4 independent 2D displays, or 3 stereoscopic/3D displays (NV Surround)
Bindless Textures
GPU Boost
TXAA
Manufactured by TSMC on a 28 nm process
New Features from GK110 :
Compute Focus SMX Improvement
CUDA Compute Capability 3.5
New Shuffle Instructions
Dynamic Parallelism
Hyper-Q (Hyper-Q's MPI functionality reserve for Tesla only)
Grid Management Unit
NVIDIA GPUDirect (GPU Direct's RDMA functionality reserve for Tesla & Quadro only)
Compute focus SMX improvement [ edit ]
With GK110, Nvidia opted to increase compute performance. The single biggest change from GK104 is that rather than 8 dedicated FP64 CUDA cores, GK110 has up to 64, giving it 8x the FP64 throughput of a GK104 SMX. The SMX also sees an increase in space for register file. Register file space has increased to 256KB compared to Fermi. The texture cache is also improved. With a 48KB space, the texture cache can become a read-only cache for compute workloads.[5]
New shuffle Instructions [ edit ]
At a low level, GK110 sees additional instructions and operations to further improve performance. New shuffle instructions allow for threads within a warp to share data without going back to memory, making the process much quicker than the previous load/share/store method. Atomic operations are also overhauled, speeding up the execution speed of atomic operations and adding some FP64 operations that were previously only available for FP32 data.[5]
NVENC [ edit ]
Hyper-Q expands GK110 hardware work queues from 1 to 32. The significance of this being that having a single work queue meant that Fermi could be under occupied at times as there wasn't enough work in that queue to fill every SM. By having 32 work queues, GK110 can in many scenarios, achieve higher utilization by being able to put different task streams on what would otherwise be an idle SMX. The simple nature of Hyper-Q is further reinforced by the fact that it's easily map to MPI, a common message passing interface frequently used in HPC. As legacy MPI-based algorithms that were originally designed for multi-CPU systems that became bottlenecked by false dependencies now have a solution. By increasing the number of MPI jobs, it's possible to utilize Hyper-Q on these algorithms to improve the efficiency all without changing the code itself.[5]
Microsoft DirectX support [ edit ]
NVIDIA Kepler GPUs of the GeForce 700 series fully support DirectX 11.0.
NVIDIA supports the DX12 API on all the DX11-class GPUs it has shipped; these belong to the Fermi, Kepler and Maxwell architectural families.[1]
Dynamic parallelism [ edit ]
Dynamic Parallelism ability is for kernels to be able to dispatch other kernels. With Fermi, only the CPU could dispatch a kernel, which incurs a certain amount of overhead by having to communicate back to the CPU. By giving kernels the ability to dispatch their own child kernels, GK110 can both save time by not having to go back to the CPU, and in the process free up the CPU to work on other tasks.[5]
Products [ edit ]
GeForce 700 (7xx) series [ edit ]
The GeForce 700 series for desktop architecture. Cheaper and lower performing products were expected to be released over time. Kepler supports 11.1 features with 11_0 feature level through the DirectX 11.1 API, however Nvidia did not enable four non-gaming features in Hardware in Kepler (for 11_1).[8][9]

[11] GeForce 700 series Maxwell chips' double precision performance is 1/32 of single-precision performance. [12]
Double precision performance of the & is either 1/3 or 1/24 of single-precision performance depending on a user-selected configuration option in the driver that boosts single-precision performance if double-precision is set to 1/24 of single-precision performance, while other chips' double precision performance is fixed at 1/24 of single-precision performance. GeForce 700 series chips' double precision performance is 1/32 of single-precision performance. 6 SLI supports connecting up to 4 identical graphics cards for a 4-way SLI configuration. Those supporting 4-way SLI can support 3-way & 2-way SLI, however a dual-GPU card already implements 2-way SLI internally, thus only 2 dual-GPU cards can be used in SLI to give a 4-way SLI configuration.

INDORE/BHOPAL: Showrooms with signboards of Chinese brands and those selling Chinese goods were targeted in Indore on Thursday.
Members of a group, Jai Hind Rashtra Sangathan, who were armed with baseball bats, attacked and smashed the shops.
They first targeted a showroom on Sapna Sangeeta road that had signboard of a Chinese company. Subsequently, they smashed other showrooms also.
The group leader Rajesh Shirodkar said that already warning had been issued to traders. "They had been warned not to sell goods made in China, yet they keep storing and selling such brands", he said
Shirodkar said that China is behaving belligerantly and after capturing Indian market, it is now eyeing the land. "They must be taught a lesson", he told journalists. The group members said that if goods continue to be stocked, sold and advertised, there would be even more attacks.
The group members said that next time it would not be limited to breaking signboards or smashing the shop, but there would be seere consequences. On condition of anonymity members said that goods (and showrooms selling them) could be set afire too.
"We again warn the traders. They must mend the ways and support boycott of Chinese goods", a member of the group said.The police came much later and asked members to refrain from creating ruckus. However, no action has been taken so far against the group members.

Did you find the "racism?" Yup, three non-consecutive Ks, the most evil letter of all. "Go White." Sure, it's clearly two non-connected words, but come on, use your imagination. Also, please ignore the numerous cultural marxism references, that in no way mitigates the horrific crime that occurred.
Concord High School Assistant Principal Ronna Cadarette told New England Cable News (NECN): “We believed that there were inappropriate innuendos on the shirts that were offensive to students. That is why we made the decision to respect those students and print new shirts.”
Luckily a careerist scumbag is on the case, eager to prostrate herself before the altar of the state religion and shed greasy tears for these imaginary offenses.
Many students weren't happy either that their commemorative T-shirts were potentially offensive. One student told CBS Boston: “It's pretty unfortunate. We don't want our class to be known for this sort of thing, that's for sure.”
We'd prefer to be remembered as another shapeless mass from generation nothing, full of legally permitted opinions, lambs to the kosher slaughter.
The student who designed the T-shirt (his name has not been released) has been banned from the senior class trip, senior prom and graduation. He will still receive his diploma, however.
More "races" justice. This little Hitler should get ten years in a gulag, minimum.
“Anyone who actually knows him, knows he's probably one of the nicest people to the core, he's a good person.”
Nice people don't use the letter K or put anything other than a negative modifier next to the word "White."
The school has also already replaced the banned T-shirts with a new, less controversial one.
Good luck in college, graduates.
If you are White the only acceptable attitude toward your unique and precious genetic heritage is to be deeply ashamed of it and constantly attempt ham-handed atonement for it. Even the slightest pride in your winning ticket in the genetic lottery is "races" and evil. This has been the endless jewish message, stridently presented on the synagogue in the living room and the publik schmuel. This attack on our people has created a nation where playing negro make-believe is now seen as a viable survival strategy, where no amount of self-negation and appeasement of foreign monsters who hate us and want us dead is enough, but keep doing it you devil. Meanwhile, here and there the specter of White "racism" lurks, displaying itself in polite behavior, abasement, suicidal altruism and occasionally in hate letters on a shirt.Look out for those White gangs. You know, the ones that terrorize swimming pools and burn down neighborhoods. Trust me, it's real, I saw it on the telavivision. We have found the thought crime hiding on a Tee Shirt. This is important.Can you spot the hidden crime think? Look carefully, kids, this is a tough puzzler!

Introduction: Class struggle is central in framing the issues of political rule, the relations of classes, the economic structures and strategies and the distribution of wealth.
Especially in the era of imperialist globalization, the class struggle takes on an international character, as multi-national corporations, international financial organizations and imperial states, directly intervene, or act through proxy, collaborator states, in the class struggle between labor and capital. This is especially evident in Latin America with the ascendancy of extractive capital: giant agro-mineral corporations play a major role in shaping state economic policies, to the detriment of labor, communities and indigenous peoples.
Classes in struggle vary over time and place, depending on their social-economic and political conditions, organization, past trajectory, the distribution of income and the locus of economic exploitation and dispossession.
The nature of the struggles and the conflicting demands between labor and capital vary in terms of comprehensiveness, intensity, geographic location and class interests. The range of issues varies from specific sectoral demands over wage and working conditions, to broader struggles ranging from public policies affecting budget allocations, investment decisions, property ownership to issues of dispossession, contamination and destructive impacts on local communities.
Class struggles involve two basic antagonists. Ruling class struggle from above, in which various sectors of capital use their social power, economic control ad state penetration to maximize present and future profits, to monopolize state budgetary allocations to limit the income shares of labor and to dispossess and displace petty commodity producers and local inhabitants from resource rich regions. Popular class struggle from below involves a panoply of classes ranging from employed and unemployed industrial workers, unionized public and private salaried employees, rural landless workers, petty commodity producers and indigenous communities. Their demands range from greater shares of national income, repossession of land and resources usurped by the state on behalf of agro-mineral corporations, to systemic change in property ownership and class relations.
One of the key determinants of the scope and depth of class struggle is the moment of the economic cycle  the point at which a particular economic model is in an ascendant phase or exhausts its possibilities and enters into decline and crises. For example, in recent years we witnessed the rise of neo-liberalism, roughly between the mid 1970s to the end of the 1990s, during which capital was on the offensive, waging class war and reversing workers and peasant advances, privatizing the economy and pillaging the public treasury. In the late 1990s to early 21st century, neo-liberalism descended into crises, precipitating intense class struggle from below ranging from unemployed workers movements in Argentina, to mass Indian movements in Bolivia and Ecuador resulting in the overthrow of incumbent regimes and the emergence of post-neo-liberal regimes.
Likewise the decline of the mega-cycle (decade long boom of commodity exporting economies) beginning in 2012-13, is accompanied by rising mass urban movements protesting the policies of the post neoliberal regimes in Brazil, Peru and Argentina.
Changes in the economic configurations of Latin America, especially the expansion of the agro-mineral, financial and commercial sectors and the decline of the manufacturing sector has had a profound impact in shaping the class structure, trade union organization and class conflict. Trade union membership has fallen precipitously. In Brazil trade union affiliates have declined from 32.1% in the early 1990s ( prior to the election of neo-liberal Cardoso 1994) to 17% in the middle of the decade under Lula (2005). In Argentina between 1986 and 2005 trade union membership declined from 48.7% to 25.4%. In Mexico membership declined from 14% to 10% between 1985 and 2005. Chile is the exception: starting from a low level 11.6% in 1986 to 16% in 2005. Moreover, the decline in trade union membership has been accompanied by the decline of industrial workers, especially in labor intensive light consumer industries, negatively impacted by imports of cheap textiles, shoes, toys, etc. from Asia as part of the trade off between exports of agro-minerals and imports of manufactured goods.
The decline in trade unions has been accompanied by a decline of political influence in state policies and a turn inward to narrow corporate, wage and workplace issues. As a result strikes have declined and are focused on immediate issues.
The political and social space in the class struggle vacated by the industrial workers, has been occupied by mass social movements in the countryside led by peasants, Indians, landless workers during the neo-liberal era and by urban struggles led by low paid service workers and lower middle class employees in the late post-neo-liberal period. This is evident in the million member mass urban struggles in Brazil in May  June 2013.
The change in the economy and social struggles has led to major shifts in the locus of class struggles and socio-economic demands.
Prior to the 1990s the major strikes, protests and other class actions were organized at the workplace by employed, unionized industrial workers. During the 1990s the axis of struggle shifted to the streets, countryside, and neighborhoods as the class struggle was spearheaded by rural landless workers, unemployed workers and downwardly mobile middle class. In the first decade and a half in the 2000s, the locus of class struggle is focused in the Indian and provincial communities adjoining sites of agro-mining corporate exploitation. The struggles focus on resisting dispossession, uprooting and destruction of habitat. The urban mass movements in the major Brazilian cities combine lower middle class, informal workers and students. They are organized in the streets: the center of organization and confrontation is located in the neighborhoods and communities. The target is the post neo-liberal state. The trade union power of convocation is dwarfed by a ratio of 20 to 1: two million working people joined marches protesting massive corruption, misallocation of budgetary resources and declining living standards and the quality of basic services in health, education and transport.
The new class struggle is basically made up of the younger generation of non-unionized workers, many in the informal sector, low paid service workers who are highly dependent on public services and lacking the social protection of the state.
The complex and changing physiognomy of the class struggle from below is matched by the continuities and changes in the class struggle from above.
The ruling classes have shifted from a position embracing brute force, via military dictatorships and ultra-authoritarian rule in launching the neo-liberal counter revolution during the early 1970s and mid-1980s, to support for a negotiated transition to electoral politics as a means to consolidate the model and to rapidly implement the neo-liberal agenda during the 1990s.
In the face of the anti-neo-liberal popular uprisings, at the end of the 1990s the agro-mineral elite embraced the post neo-liberal center-left regimes and secured privileged places in the new model, accepting increased taxes and royalty payments in exchange for vast state subsidies and large scale land grants (land grabs).
With the decline of the mega-boom (post 2012) different sectors of the ruling class have adopted different strategies: some (mostly agro-mineral sectors in Brazil) have pressured for a return to neo-liberalism within the center-left regimes; others, especially agro-business association in Argentina, have organized mass actions to undermine the post neo-liberal regimes; foreign financial and investment houses have shifted capital to more lucrative sites in other regions.
While the class struggle in its multiple expressions is a constant and moving force in determining economic strategies and the direction social policy, the organizational form which it takes has changed dramatically over the past half century. Even what appears to be similar organizations, like movements, trade unions, community based mobilization, have great variations in their internal make-up and mode of operation. Adding to the complexity, organizations change over time in their structure and relationship to the state, depending on the politics of the regime in power.
Let us illustrate.
During the 1970s, trade unions in Chile, Argentina, Peru, and Uruguay were highly political, playing a major role in mobilizing and uniting with parties and neighborhood movements in promoting the socialization of the economy and resisting the military take overs. Likewise during the later phases of the military dictatorships in Brazil and Peru, militant trade unions engaged in massive strikes to hasten the advent of democratic electoral politics. Subsequently, with the rise of post-neo-liberal regimes, most of the trade unions engaged in tripartite collective bargaining over narrow corporate demands, eschewing any community based struggles over broader social issues and in many cases supporting regime policies through co-opted leaders. In other words trade unions, have at different times served as social vanguards and allies of mass movements, mediators in social compromises and active collaborators and transmission belts of the state. The same organizational concept a trade union covers contradictory responses to the demands of class struggle. The same is true of social movements. During the onset and onslaught of the neo-liberal regimes, the social movements played a leading role in challenging the ascendant regimes and overthrowing them during the economic crises. The movements varied from locally based unemployed urban workers in Argentina, to community based Indian movements in Ecuador and Bolivia, to centralized rural workers movements in Brazil. With the rise of the post neo-liberal regimes and the upswing of the mega-cycle the unemployed workers movements virtually disappeared in Argentina, important sectors of the Indian movement especially the cocaleros in Bolivia lost their autonomy and became a political prop for the Evo Morales regime and the MST or rural workers movement, diminished their land take-over activity in pursuit of economic subsidies from the Lula-Dilma regimes in Brazil.
What is striking about the notion of social movements is that when the class struggle by older, established and/or co-opted movements declines, new vibrant movements burst onto the scene. In Bolivia the TIPNIS movement in Bolivia led the struggle against the extractive strategies of the Morales regime. In Brazil a million member urban mass movements challenged the policies, priorities and corrupt politicians of the Lula-Dilma regime. Eco-indigenous movements bypassed the co-opted trade union and social movements in Ecuador, Argentina, Paraguay, Peru New dynamic community based civic and class organizations engage in mass confrontations with extractive-mineral multi-nationals and the state in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and elsewhere.
The dynamic of extractive capital with its radical policies of uprooting, displacing, dispossessing entire communities provokes comprehensive, cross-class alliances which challenge the power and prerogatives of the state to dictate development policy, at least with regard to regional exploitation of resources. With the decline of the extractive mega-cycle and the drop in demand for commodities and subsequent decline in prices, as growth in China, India and the rest of Asia slows, a new comprehensive national (as opposed to regional) class struggle shows signs of returning. The elite debate class strategies. The extractive capital sectors demand intensified production to compensate for declining prices; others secure cut backs in taxes and social costs; still others, in post neo-liberal regimes, call for a new development model in the face of mass unrest (Lula DaSilva in Brazil). The center-left is squeezed by both ends of the class structure, in the post mega-cycle class conflict. Post neo-liberal regimes fearful of the flight of capital are pressured to make greater tax concessions to capital on the one hand, and fearful of the rising mass urban movements demanding positive and effective increases in public services and employment.
Given the high degree of dependence built into the extractive model, extricating the regime from its links to commodity trade and building a new balanced model will involve a broader and deeper commitment to the popular classes and a return to class struggle from below.
Case Studies of Class Struggle from Above and Below
Class struggle has clearly been internationalized. Imperial intervention is a central part of class struggle from above and is endemic, whether in the form of multi-national corporations, investing and disinvesting, or via imperial state promoted military coups and destabilization policies or by direct or proxy military invasions. Anti-imperialist class struggle from below is less prominent, yet manifests itself in international aid and solidarity policies from Venezuela via ALBA, international strategy meetings of peasants, indigenous people and solidarity movements. Yet the bulk of the class struggle against exploitation finds expression in movements by oppressed and dispossessed peoples who rely mainly on their own resource base in contrast to the ruling classes which depend on strategic imperial allies.
Berlin's office of the interior banned the mosque association known as "Fussilet 33" on Tuesday. The organization is suspected of being a meeting point for radical Islamists, prosecutors said.
Anis Amri, a Tunisian national who launched an attack on a Berlin Christmas market in December that left 12 people dead and dozens more injured, frequented the mosque, according to authorities.
Last week, authorities in Berlin arrested three men suspected of links to the self-proclaimed "Islamic State" (IS) militant group in an anti-terror raid. Police said the men had visited the mosque operated by the association.
Police raided 24 locations across Berlin early Tuesday morning with more than 400 law enforcement officers participating in the operation, local authorities said in a tweet.
Authorities closed the mosque following raids last week. The mosque has been under surveillance since 2015 for its suspected links in recruitment activities. It had also raised donations to support terrorist attacks in Syria.
Counterterrorism measures
Banning the association means that the group is formally disbanded and can no longer rent mosques for their activities.
Germany has taken proactive measures to curb terrorist threats and tackle radicalization following the Berlin attack.
The measures include launching dozens of raids across the country and proposing legislation to detain foreign nationals suspected of extremist activity who have been denied residency, a precursor for deportation.
According to Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, more than 500 individuals have been classified as a potential threat in Germany, of which roughly half of them are non-German nationals.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Leipzig, October 2016 Police in Leipzig arrested 22-year-old Syrian refugee Jaber al-Bakr after a two-day manhunt following the discovery of explosives and other bomb-making equipment at his apartment in Chemnitz. He was suspected of plotting to attack a Berlin airport. Two days later, he hanged himself in his prison cell.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Ansbach, July 2016 In July, the "Islamic State" (IS) claimed responsibility for two attacks carried out by asylum seekers. 15 people were injured in a crowded wine bar next to the entrance to a music festival in the Bavarian town of Ansbach after a rejected Syrian asylum seeker detonated an explosive device. The man killed himself in the attack.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Würzburg, July 2016 A 17-year-old asylum seeker wielding an axe and a knife went on a rampage on a regional train near Würzburg, seriously injuring four members of a tourist family from Hong Kong and a passer-by. The attacker was shot dead by police. German authorities said the teenager was believed to be a "lone wolf" inspired by the IS, but without being a member of the network.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Düsseldorf, May 2016 Three suspected members of the "Islamic State" terror network were arrested in the German states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Brandenburg and Baden Württemberg. Authorities say two of the men planned to blow themselves up in downtown Düsseldorf, while the other attacker and a fourth jihadist arrested in France planned to target pedestrians with guns and explosive devices.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Essen, April 2016 Police arrested three people over a bomb blast that injured three people in a Sikh temple in Essen. The bomb detonated after a wedding party, blowing out windows and destroying a part of the building's exterior. A 16-year-old suspect turned himself in after police showed footage of the attack from a surveillance camera and special police units arrested another young suspect in his parents' home.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Hanover, February 2016 German-Moroccan Safia S. is charged with stabbing a police officer at the main train station in the northern city of Hanover. The 16-year-old girl is suspected of having been "motivated by members of the Islamic State group in Syria to commit this act," chief prosecutor Simon Heinrichs said.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Berlin, February 2016 In separate raids across the country, police arrested three Algerians suspected of links to the "Islamic State" militant group and of having planned a terrorist attack in Berlin. The Berlin prosecutor's office said prosecutors were aware of a "concrete" plan to target the capital.
Chronology: Terror plots in Germany Oberursel, April 2015 The Eschborn-Frankfurt City loop bike race was called off after German police discovered it may have been the target of an Islamist terror attack. A 35-year-old German with a Turkish background and his 34-year-old wife were arrested on suspicion of planning the attack. Police found bomb-making materials in their home near the bike route.

Right now, somewhere in the world, a sunrise or sunset is painting the sky a majestic red
And the chances are a smartphone is capturing that moment and uploading it to Instagram.
Now, you can see all of these sunrises and sunsets in real-time using an interactive ‘All Our Yesterdays' map.
Hover over the map below to see a sunset in your area
The global map, created by designer Michelle Chandra, places a marker for Instagram users' #sunrise and #sunset tags from the past 24 hours.
‘We live in a world that follows a fixed idea of time, a standard synchronised time held in place by time zones, clocks, and calendars,' Chandra writes on her website.
‘Instagram users reveal a different idea of time, a richly textured irregular time in which the setting sun and end of the day for one individual is the beginning of the day for another, a never-ending loop.'
The larger the bright dot on the zoomable map, the closer to the moment of the actual event.

'Instagram users who chase the sun with their cameras testify to the sun's ceaseless grip on our lives,' says Chandra. On a separate map, she plots dark circles of all sunsets and sunrises uploaded from the past day
Some of the best images from the map posted on the May 3. The map automatically updates to include the latest Instagram shots
WHY MARS' SUNSETS ARE BLUE AND EARTH'S ARE RED While much of the surface of Mars is a deep red colour, sunsets on the planet are blue. This is because the red dust in the atmosphere filters out much of the red light from the sun. As the sun dips lower in the sky, its light has to travel through the lower layers of the atmosphere where the dust is thicker. On Earth our own atmosphere scatters blue light creating the red and orange shades that light up the sky at sun down .
A search bar in the upper right corner can look up a certain location and users can also zoom in on photographs taken of a city or landmark.
Users can then hover over the dots to see the photograph captured.
Chandra found that Instagram users tend to upload photos of the sunset within four hours of the sun setting.
But when it comes to a sunrise, many Instagram users wait until the end of the day to reminisce on how it started.
On a separate map, Chandra plots dark circles of all sunsets and sunrises uploaded from the past day.
A third map reveals when two people are posting at the same time, with one updating the beginning and the other seeing the end of a day.
Chandra says the project reveals how our social networks can show the reality of time as a never-ending loop.
‘Our absolute ideas of a fixed quantified time cannot escape the irregular rhythms of the cosmic world we call home,' Chandra says.

Abstract
This paper traces the evolution of the nature of the EU's internal market, from its origin in the 1950s to its current redesign in the aftermath of the Euro-crisis. It suggests that the relationship between ‘the market' and ‘the social' has shifted multiple times throughout the Union's history. In the first stage, social policy was meant to complement the functioning of the internal market, and tease out potential economic asymmetries in the market. In the second stage, social policy became geared not towards levelling out conditions of competition in the market, but to explicitly protect the capacity of Member States to impose their understanding of ‘the social' on the market. Finally, in the last decade, social policy on the Union level has started to move in the exact opposite direction. The EU's institutions now understand social policy diversity throughout the EU no longer as a necessary complement for, but rather as inimical to, a functioning market in the EU. In doing so, however, they overlook a number of institutional asymmetries, normative biases and legal implications, which mean that any attempt to create a ‘social market economy' – as Article 3 (3) TEU commits the EU to do – is bound to be distinctively light on ‘social' and heavy on ‘market'.
After the Golden State Warriors ran roughshod over the rest of the NBA during this year's postseason, and closed out their biggest rival, the Cleveland Cavaliers, in a mere 5 games, the topic of NBA conversation immediately moves on to “How does anyone beat the Warriors next season?”
ESPN's Zach Lowe discussed this very matter with some of the league's GMs, including the Rockets' Daryl Morey, and the Big D had some pretty interesting things to say about his plans to combat the Dubs.
Perhaps the most prominent bit of Lowe's talk with Morey, was Daryl's admission that, in true Morey fashion, he has something potentially big in the cards, if he can manage to pull it off. He told Lowe:
"They are not unbeatable. There have been bigger upsets in sports history. We are going to keep improving our roster... We are used to long odds. If Golden State makes the odds longer, we might up our risk profile and get even more aggressive. We have something up our sleeve."
So now the next question becomes, what exactly could he have up his sleeve? The Rockets don't have a ton a cap space when it comes to free agency. They have $87.6 million in guaranteed contracts, and the total could be higher depending on what decisions they make with Nene, Troy Williams, Isaiah Taylor, Kyle Wiltjer.
The projected cap sits at $102 million ($122 million for the luxury tax), so the Rockets could have anywhere from $6 million to $14 million to play with. It's enough to make an addition, but not likely enough to make a major difference, at least when it comes to matching up with Golden State.
The Rockets were linked to Danilo Gallinari at times this past season, and now that the 6'10” forward has officially opted out of his contract, the upper end of the potential money available in Houston might be enough to get it done. Gallinari made $15 million last season with Denver. The Rockets are obviously a better situation for winning than the Nuggets, but Gallinari likely wants a raise. Plus, Houston would still need another piece.
The most likely move for Morey is in the trade market, and he has plenty of ammunition to get something done. In my eyes, the only untouchables on the Houston roster are James Harden, Pat Beverley and Clint Capela. That leaves Trevor Ariza, Lou Williams, Eric Gordon, Montrezl Harrell, Sam Dekker and Ryan Anderson (despite his difficult contract) as potential pieces to swing a deal. Morey can get something done with that.
So what say you, Rockets fans? What move do you think Morey has “up his sleeve”? Who would you like to see in H-town to help the Rockets match up with Golden State (and San Antonio)?
(CNN) -- Asian markets on Friday rallied after Wall Street surged on news central banks around the world were pumping billions of dollars into money markets and the U.S. government was planning a broad program to stem the credit crunch.
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) September 18, 2008 in New York City.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng opened up more than 7 percent, Japanese share prices were up about 3.3 percent, and Australian shares were up about 4 percent. Taipei and Singapore shares also showed gains.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke briefed House and Senate leaders Thursday evening on a program to let banks get rid of mortgage-related assets that have been hard to value and harder to trade.
Democrat Barney Frank of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said he believes legislation could be acted on next week.
The developments followed news of a package of up to $247 billion aimed at money markets from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan.
The injection of cash, which amounts to an expansion of up to $180 billion in available funds, is an effort to fuel economic activity.
The New York markets had most time to digest and react, and the Dow Jones industrials, the Nasdaq and the S&P all ended the day more than three percent up. The Dow wiped out much of its Wednesday losses which was its second worst day of the year.
In Europe the picture was positive for much of the day but by close of trading, Britain's FTSE-100 was down half a percent, despite Lloyds TSB's proposed $21.8 billion deal to acquire struggling HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, helping to ease some concern among traders there.
Germany's DAX finished down 0.39 percent and France's CAC 40 index down 1.5 percent.
Russia's main stock exchanges suspended trading for a second consecutive day as the government tried to stop plunging in share prices and restore confidence.

With major financial and insurance institutions teetering, commercial banks have tightened their lending policies and increased interest rates, taking billions of dollars out of the economy.
Under the rescue plan, the European Central Bank will inject up to $110 billion, the Swiss National Bank up to $27 billion, the Bank of Japan up to $60 billion, the Bank of England up to $40 billion and the Bank of Canada up to $10 billion.
In addition, the Federal Reserve acted to ease a spike in overnight lending rates in the U.S. by injecting $55 billion into the domestic banking system.
"We're very grateful that the rescue package has been put on the table, because frankly the world's inter-bank markets are just simply not working in the manner that they should do," said David Buik of the BGC Partners brokerage firm in London. "There's a wholesale mistrust ... amongst everybody."
"It is essential that the central banks do stand there and massage the trust back into action," Buik said. "Without them, we would be in unbelievably uncontrollable turmoil."
Britain's Financial Services Authority also temporarily stopped short selling -- the practice of selling securities the seller does not own, in the hope of repurchasing them later at a lower price. TIME.com looks at the short sellers
It is an attempt to make money out of an expected fall in price and has been partially blamed by some analysts for pushing down share prices.
Thursday's more positive news contrasted sharply with the previous day on Wall Street, when the Dow Jones industrials tumbled 449 points -- its second worst day of the year, but only the second worst day this week. The Nasdaq and the S&P also suffered drops of more than 4 percent.
The sell-off came in the wake of investment bank Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch's sale to Bank of America, and the U.S. government announcing an $85 billion plan to bail out insurance giant American International Group (AIG).
American financial investor Jim Rogers told CNN: "It's going to get worse. There are going to be more bankruptcies. There's going to be a big cleanout in the financial system."
"It's a complete collapse of confidence," Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities Ltd in Hong Kong, told The Associated Press. "The financial crisis in the U.S. is hitting everyone, everyone is running for cover. If the largest insurance company can fail, than no one is safe."
The remaining two Wall Street investment banks were hit particularly hard on Wednesday with Morgan Stanley down 29 percent and Goldman Sachs down 21 percent.
British bank Barclays said it had reached a deal Wednesday to purchase key units of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers for $1.75 billion.
The deal came just two days after Barclays walked away from talks to buy the beleaguered financial institution in its entirety.
Barclays will acquire Lehman's North American investment banking and capital markets businesses for $250 million in cash.
Barclays will also purchase Lehman's New York headquarters and two data centers in New Jersey at their current market value estimated at $1.5 billion, a company statement said.

SAN JOSE (CBS SF) — Businesses at the Westfield Valley Fair Mall which straddles the San Jose – Santa Clara border are finding out workers are gravitating toward businesses on the San Jose side because of differences in each city's minimum wage.
In 2012, businesses in the western portion of the mall in Santa Clara paid a minimum wage of $8 an hour, but beginning that year those on the eastern side in San Jose began paying a $10 an hour minimum wage.
Philip Sandigo, the manager of a shoe store, told NPR that when San Jose raised its minimum wage, he lost about half his staff to stores on the other side of the mall that paid $2 an hour more.
They went to the stores on the side of the mall that paid $2 an hour more and Sandigo said to this day it's a struggle to find new hires.
“We get the bottom of the barrel here,” Sandigo told NPR. “Not really focused. … One guy came in high the other day.”
The Gap store at the mall sits exactly on the city line and faced documenting how long its lowest-paid employees spent on each side in order to pay them accordingly.
Instead, the store decided to pay all its minimum wageworkers the higher wage.
There are two Wetzel's Pretzels stores, each on opposite ends of the mall, with those on the Santa Clara side earning the lower minimum wage.
Franchise owner Yvonne Ryzak told the Wall Street Journal she rotates employees between each store. “That way, I don't have employees who are resentful that their colleagues get paid more than them,” she told the WSJ.
Ryzak also had to account for the 25 percent higher wages she was paying. Ryzak has raised some of her prices but told WSJ she also gives employees up to 20 percent of her stores' profits each year – bonuses she predicts will shrink as the rising wages chip away at her bottom line.
Since the 2012 hike, minimum wage rates have changed again wth Santa Clara at $9/hour and San Jose at $10.15/hour.
In the midst of European car news and concepts coming out of the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, Shelby American just unveiled details about an American pickup truck. The all-new Shelby Baja Raptor takes the already-extreme Ford F-150 Raptor and cranks it up several notches into the stratosphere of off-road insanity.
Shelby American
Shelby American added a tune, a custom cold-air intake with a high-flow air filter, and a performance aluminum intercooler to bring the horsepower rating up to 525 and the torque up to 610 foot-pounds. It actually didn't do much with the stock EcoBoost twin-turbo 3.5-liter V-6 found in the regular Raptor.
Shelby American
While there are no big surprises under the hood, there are a few under the rest of the truck. It has four-corner adjustable Fox Racing Stage 2 suspension allowing it to adapt to any terrain on- or off-road with simple tool-free adjustment. This beast rides on 18-inch alloy wheels with BFGoodrich KM2 35/12.50R18 tires, which should get you pretty much wherever you want to go.
Shelby American
Like with anything bearing the Shelby name, the look of the Shelby Baja Raptor is as extreme as its performance. It has a functional dual-intake ram air hood, custom bumpers and skid plates, a chase rack mounted on the bed with full-size spare wheel mounts, and multiple LED light bars. Power automatic running boards make the Baja Raptor easy to climb into despite the truck's 3-inch lift. It also gets custom embroidered leather seats, a numbered CSM serial number plate and abundant Shelby badging inside and out.

Rachel Rodriguez was murdered by her husband, Epifanio Guzman (KLBK)
A Texas man pleaded guilty this week to strangling his wife to death and then sleeping next to her corpse.
At a court hearing on Monday, 43-year-old Epifanio Guzman was sentenced to 45 years in prison as a condition of his plea agreement. One count of indecent liberties with a child and another pending case was dropped as part of the deal.
Guzman said that he had strangled his wife, Rachel Rodriguez, during an argument on May 30 of last year. After the body went limp, Guzman said that he placed it on the bed, and then he fell asleep next to it, according to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal.
When Guzman woke up, he saw blood coming from his wife's mouth. He said that he wrapped her body in a red sleeping bag, and drove it to Big Spring to be dumped.
Guzman said that he had made plans to kill his stepfather while in Big Spring, but he never got the chance.
Rodriguez was reported missing by her family on June 3, and Guzman was arrested one day later. The arrest warrant said that Rodriguez's son found his mother's room “trashed,” and her sheets were covered in blood stains.
At the court hearing on Monday, Judge Jim Bob Darnell explained that Guzman would have to serve at least half of his 45-year sentence before being eligible for parole.
Rodriguez's family were given an opportunity to speak, and they told Guzman that they were not able to have an open casket at the funeral because the body had been badly decomposed.
“Not only did you end her life, but you took away the opportunity for us to see her one last time,” Kathy Longoria, Rodriguez's cousin, said.
Members of the family scoffed at reports that Guzman said that he loved his wife and did not mean to kill her. Rachel Rodriguez's son, Gabriel Gonzales, lost control of his emotions while speaking about how Rodriguez's grandchildren would grow up without her.
“I just want to go over there and f*ck you up,” he said.
Prosecutor Sunshine Stanek predicted that Guzman would spend the rest of his life in prison.
“There's no number on this planet, in this universe that can bring Rachel back,” she said. “This family is a very strong family a very close-knit family and I hope that this sentence provides some justice for them and provides some closure for them from this point forward.”
Longoria said that she hoped that her cousin's murder would be a signal for other women to get out of abusive relationships.
“I don't know how we can get it to stop, but it needs to stop and if you know of someone that is getting abused, you need to speak out and get that person some help,” she insisted. “I wish that we had known that was going on with Rachel and we wouldn't be here today.”

If you're not watching the trampoline events at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, well ... what the hell is wrong with you? This is basically the best thing you could have ever hoped for when you were eight years old. With the advent of trampoline, we're only a few years away from "The Carpet Is Lava" as an Olympic event. Plus, it's one of the most GIF-able events in the whole dang 'lympics.
First of all, French trampolinist Gregoire Pennes demonstrates that the thing you did messing around on your rich friend's trampoline and thinking you were a genius for doing it is now an acceptable transition move.
Trampoline, like all the best Olympic events, combines an amazing amount of athleticism with a spectacularly high level of absurdity. Watch this for a while and try not to just start cackling:
Of course, the absurdity doesn't just end on the court (by which i mean the big trampoline). There is plenty of silly action on the sidelines as well.
And naturally, if you hope to be an Olympic trampoline coach, you'll need, above all else, a very sturdy neck.
I love you, Olympic trampoline. Never leave us.
Audubon's First Print Is Found, Ending Long Search
toggle caption Stewart Library, Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
For decades, scholars have wondered what happened to naturalist John James Audubon's first commercial illustration, of a small bird called a heath hen. In 1824, the engraving was destined to decorate a banknote -- but it was soon lost. Now an example has been found.
Robert Peck, a curator at Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences, says that in 1824, Audubon wrote in his diary that he had drawn a heath hen for a Philadelphia engraver.
But finding a print of the drawing wasn't an easy task.
"At the time -- the middle of the 19th century -- there were thousands and thousands of banknotes circulating," Peck says. "This was before we had a national currency."
Peck's partner in the search was currency historian Eric Newman -- formally known as a numismatic scholar. Together, they looked for a note from a New Jersey bank like the one Audubon mentioned in his diary.
But they determined that the bank had likely destroyed all its currency. So instead, they looked for the bird in a group of sample sheets from the engraver who had hired Audubon.
The sheets provided banks with stock art for their currency -- many of the images were of George Washington and bald eagles, Peck says.

"And there, amidst all of these rather staid and patriotic symbols that would be appropriate for banknotes, was this tiny little bird, rushing through the grass," Peck says.
That's when he and Newman knew they had found Audubon's bird, ending a decade-long search and filling in a blank in the career of one America's premier naturalists.
Just a few years later, Aubudon would publish his watershed work, The Birds of America, which established him as both an artist and a celebrity.
As for the heath hen, the animal is reportedly extinct. And Peck says it was Audubon's bad luck to choose the small, unassuming bird for a banknote.
"A little scurrying grouse rushing into a bed of grass is not the kind of confident image that a bank president wants to convey," Peck says.
It's very likely, Peck says, that Audubon's grouse was simply replaced by a bald eagle.
Katharina Nocun über AfD-Programme
„Preußentum und Rassismus“
Die Netzaktivistin Katharina Nocun hat die Wahlprogramme der AfD analysiert. Im Interview verrät sie, warum ihr die Partei Angst macht.
taz: Katharina Nocun, Sie haben in Ihrer Freizeit die Wahlprogramme der AfD gelesen. Wieso tut man sich das an?
Nocun: Ich stand vor einem Problem. Die AfD ist im Weltbild ihrer Wähler schwer angreifbar: Kritisiert man sie, gehört man zur Lügenpresse. Erwähnt man die AfD nicht, ist die Rede vom Schweigekartell. Nur positive Berichte gelten als neutral. Das ist eine universelle Teflon-Strategie zur Kritikabwehr.
Also was tun?
Diese Abwehrstrategie kann nicht bei Screenshots aus dem eigenen Wahlprogramm funktionieren. Über die AfD wird fast nur im Kontext von Flüchtlingspolitik geschrieben. Was died Partei sonst noch fordert, ist kaum bekannt. Also habe ich mir die Wahlprogramme der AfD heruntergeladen und gelesen. Einige „what-the-fuck“-Momente später habe ich mich dazu entschlossen, daraus einen Blogeintrag zu machen.
Welche Programme haben Sie gelesen?
Ich habe mir die Parteiprogramme der AfD-Landesverbände angeschaut, die demnächst wählen: Rheinland-Pfalz, Sachsen-Anhalt und Baden-Württemberg. Das sind die aktuellsten Programme. Sie zeigen sehr gut, wie die Partei momentan tickt, da die Mitglieder dem Programm zustimmen müssen.
Was war ihr erster Eindruck beim Lesen?
Was ist das denn für eine Resterampe? Wo bin ich denn hier gelandet? Verklärung preußischer Zustände, religiös-fundamentalistische Weltsichten, offener Rassismus, Klimawandelleugnung, marktradikale Konzepte aus der Mottenkiste. Alles dabei.
im Interview: Katharina Nocun, 29, ist Netzaktivistin und war im Bundesvorstand der Piratenpartei, ist heute noch Mitglied. Neben rechtsextremen Parteiprogrammen kennt sie sich mit Datenschutz aus. Derzeit arbeitet sie bei Campact und bloggt auf kattascha.de.
AfD-Erfolge in Umfragen speisen sich auch aus Abstiegsängsten. Aber wie sozial ist die Partei?
Überhaupt nicht. Die AfD ist eine marktradikale Partei, die keine Lehren aus den Finanzkrisen der letzten Jahre gezogen hat. Hartz IV stellt sie nicht in Frage: Ein Transferempfänger soll sich laut Programm sogar „solidarisch zeigen, um die Belastung der Gemeinschaft so niedrig wie möglich zu halten.“
Was heißt das konkret?
In Baden-Württemberg schlägt die AfD ein Projekt zur Bürgerarbeit für Langzeitarbeitslose vor. Dabei interessant: Das gab es schon 2010 unter Ursula von der Leyen, damals ist das Modellprojekt aufgrund geringer Vermittlungsraten und hoher Kosten grandios gescheitert.
Klingt nicht sehr sozial.
Es geht noch weiter: Die AfD befürwortet zum Beispiel Paul Kirchhofs Steuermodell. Das bedeutet ein klares Nein zur progressiven Besteuerung: Alle sollen einen pauschalen Steuersatz von circa 25 Prozent zahlen. Millionäre würden jubeln. Normale Arbeitnehmer eher nicht. Das Mindestlohn-Gesetz entspringt laut Frauke Petry sogar einer „neosozialistischen Ideologie“. Die AfD setzt sich in keinster Weise für Arbeitnehmer ein.
Vertritt die AfD am Ende gar nicht die Interessen des sprichwörtlichen „kleinen Mannes“, wie sie proklamiert?
Im Gegenteil. Die AfD vertritt ganz klar die Interessen eines kruden Sammelsuriums von Interessengruppen: Großverdiener sollen weniger Steuern zahlen, radikale christliche Sekten bekommen Geschenke wie „Homeschooling“, das Infragestellen des menschlich verursachten Klimawandels begünstigt Umweltverschmutzer und Rechtsradikale finden sich im Rassismus wieder.
Wie steht die AfD zur Familienpolitik?
Sie ist erzkonservativ bis ins Mark. Die stellvertretende Vorsitzende Beatrix von Storch holt die Diskussion zurück in die sechziger Jahre. Sie fordert als Abtreibungsgegnerin ernsthaft die Kriminalisierung von Schwangerschaftsabbrüchen. Arbeitenden Frauen stärkt die AfD auch nicht gerade den Rücken.
AfD-Politiker fabulieren gerne von der „Lügenpresse“. Wie stehen sie denn laut Wahlprogramm zur Pressefreiheit?
Die Positionen dazu klingen ironisch, sind es aber leider nicht: In Baden-Württemberg will die AfD „auf die öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten einwirken und auch im Bildungsbereich Anstrengungen unternehmen, damit Ehe und Familie positiv dargestellt werden.“ Was denn nun? Meinungsfreiheit, Pressefreiheit oder staatliche Beeinflussung der Medien?
Klingt nach Gleichschaltung.
In Sachsen-Anhalt findet sich noch etwas Interessantes zur Freiheit der Kunst: „Museen, Orchester und Theater sind in der Pflicht, einen positiven Bezug zur eigenen Heimat zu fördern. Die Bühnen des Landes Sachsen-Anhalt sollten neben den großen klassischen internationalen Werken stets auch klassische deutsche Stücke spielen und sie so inszenieren, dass sie zur Identifikation mit unserem Land anregen.“ Was für eine Partei möchte Theatern vorschreiben, welche Stücke sie zu inszenieren haben? Das kennen wir nur aus repressiven Regimen.
Was sagt ein solches Wahlprogramm über die Partei aus?
Es ist ein Spiegel des Wachstums der letzten Jahre. Die AfD ist eine Plattform für alle möglichen Leute, die vielleicht nach einer Partei gesucht haben und diese nicht im demokratischen Spektrum gefunden haben. Das sieht man nicht zuletzt im Spitzenpersonal der AfD.
Wen haben Sie da im Blick?
Die Liste ist lang: Die stellvertretende Vorsitzende Beatrix von Storch ist bestens vernetzt mit religiösen Sekten. Sie nennt Stammzellenforschung allen Ernstes „Kinderleichenhandel“. Gleichzeitig will sie Kinder an Grenzen erschießen lassen. Dem ist nichts mehr hinzuzufügen. In Rheinland-Pfalz schickt die AfD mit Uwe Junge ein ehemaliges Mitglied der rechtsradikalen Partei „Die Freiheit“ ins Rennen. Der Parteichefin Frauke Petry droht eine Strafanzeige wegen Meineids.
Wie sieht es mit der Parteibasis aus?
Der Kern der AfD ist noch viel radikaler als das, was in den Programmen steht. Mir macht es Sorgen, dass im nächsten Jahr jemand wie Björn Höcke an der Parteispitze stehen könnte. Dann haben wir noch ganz andere Sachen in der Öffentlichkeit als einen Schießbefehl.
In Umfragen legte die AfD vor allem „nach Köln“ zu. Die Debatte ist seitdem weit nach rechts offen. Helfen da rationale Argumente?
Ja. Es ist wichtig, sachlich zu bleiben. Mein Ziel ist es, potenzielle Wähler, die sich in Angst und Vorurteile hineinsteigern, mit den Statements aus den Wahlprogrammen wachzurütteln. Die AfD ist eine Partei der einfachen Lösungen: Wir kennen das Sündenbock-Phänomen aus unserer Geschichte zu Genüge. An diesem Punkt gegen Flüchtlinge vorzugehen, löst überhaupt keine Probleme, im Gegenteil: Es wird der Art und Weise unseres Zusammenlebens nachhaltigen Schaden zufügen. Ich als Migrantin betrachte diese Entwicklung mit persönlicher Sorge, ich möchte gerne hier wohnen bleiben.
Gab es eine offizielle Reaktion seitens der AfD auf ihre Analyse?
Auf der offiziellen AfD-Seite Baden-Württemberg wird ein Blogger zitiert, der meine Analyse kommentiert hat: „Ihren polnischen Hintergrund, mit dem sie gerne kokettiert und den sie auch gegen die AfD anbringt, erwähne ich wegen Bedeutungslosigkeit nicht.“ Dass meiner Analyse erst einmal vorangestellt werden muss, in welchem Land ich geboren wurde, spricht Bände.
Was gab es sonst für Feedback auf Ihre Recherche?
Einige Leute, sowohl Wähler als auch Mitglieder der AfD, wollten teilweise überhaupt nicht glauben, dass die Zitate tatsächlich aus AfD-Programmen stammen. Ich habe Mails von Mitgliedern und Wählern bekommen, die gesagt haben: „Das wusste ich nicht, ich wähle jetzt doch nicht die AfD.“
Gab es keinen Gegenwind?
Doch: Mir wurde vorgeworfen, dass die Screenshots ein „Fake“ seien. Beschimpfungen gab es gratis dazu: von einem liebevollen „Verpiss dich“ bis zum neckischen „viel Spaß in der Hölle“ war alles dabei.
Wie gehen Sie mit solchen Hassmails um?
Heute während ich mir Tortellini zu Mittag gemacht habe, hat mich jemand auf Twitter gefragt, ob ich schon mal einen Kopfschuss gehabt hätte. Meine Reaktion war, noch ein bisschen Parmesan auf die Sauce zu machen. Mich lässt das relativ kalt. Ich finde es sogar gut, wenn unter meinen Blogbeiträgen krude Kommentare erscheinen. Dann sieht man, was für eine Suppe hinter der AfD herschwimmt. Ich versuche auch, mir meinen Humor zu bewahren: Ich gebe gerne zu, einen Lügenpresse-Ausweis zu haben. Den hat mir eine Freundin zum Karneval mit Photoshop gemacht.
I just turned 13 years old, and I am in 7th grade at Rogers-Herr Middle School in Durham, North Carolina. I heard about the Kramden Institute from my dad, who is an avid volunteer there. Kramden is a non-profit organization that refurbishes computers to be awarded to underprivileged children who have been nominated by their teachers. Kramden also offers classes where people can learn computer skills.
My dad volunteers to help refurbish computers, and I was very interested in volunteering with him when I was 11 years old, but I had to wait until I was at least 12 according to Kramden's policy. When I was finally allowed to join him, at first we always went there together, but after a short time, I started volunteering even when my dad couldn't make it.

I've learned a lot from my time at Kramden, but what I love most is that the computers we refurbish go to underprivileged kids who would not otherwise be able to afford a computer of their own. I've realized that not all children have the resources they need to learn about technology, which will limit their future potential, but with Kramden's refurbished computers, more kids will get access to computers in their homes.
I feel happy at Kramden for several reasons:
They are incredibly well-organized and almost always have a full house.
It's a community of folks that want to help these children, so I fit right in.
It's a place I get to go on my own.
We listen to music while we work.
I've met new people there! I get to escape my little brothers (and even my mom!), and I feel good about what I'm doing there.
I have been volunteering at Kramden for over a year now, and it has opened up many opportunities for me. Last spring, I did my G.R.E.A.T project (Gang Resistance Education and Training) for school through my volunteer work at Kramden. And, during the fall, I took an Introduction to Game Development class through Kramden, where a partner and I created our own XBOX ONE video game.

Presently, I am working toward my Girl Scout Silver Award; an award where girls take the lead to create something sustainable for their community. For my Silver Award, I have chosen to create a class at Kramden to teach middle school kids how to program. My dad will teach the class with my assistance. We will be teaching an introductory computer programming class quarterly as well as offering monthly group programming events where students will be invited to work on a more specific programming project. Our first class is scheduled to start in February, and the first club event is scheduled to start in March of this year.
The quarterly classes will introduce programming Java using Project Greenfoot, and during the monthly events we will do projects using the Raspberry Pi. If you don't already know, the Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card-sized computer that helps people learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. A project we are considering during one of the monthly events is teaching students how to use programming languages to create something fun like a Minecraft Mod or a video game.
These programming classes will benefit the community because the children of today will shape the technology of the future. All students should have exposure to technology and even some programming. Even if kids never decide to become software engineers, they will have learned valuable problem-solving skills, and they will have a better understanding of how applications are written. This will help them learn to use other applications in the future.
I am happy that through my volunteer work at Kramden and my Girl Scout Silver Award project, I am giving back to my community!
It was a legal iTunes purchase that helped the feds nab Artem Vaulin, the alleged proprietor of KickassTorrents (KAT), the world's biggest purveyor of illegal torrent files. The irony is almost too much to bear pointing out. But according to one lawyer familiar with the ins and outs of copyright infringement, the case could have sweeping repercussions on how torrents are regulated.
First a refresher, if all this talk of torrents sounds so 2006 to you: BitTorrenting is a way to share large files over peer-to-peer networks, and it's frequently used for pirating movies and television shows and music. But it's been in steady decline in recent years, thanks in part to the rise of viable paid streaming options like Netflix and Amazon Video. A recent report from Sandvine pegs BitTorrent as comprising less than five percent of total daily traffic in North America. It's still large enough, though, to have made KAT a very big business, according to the criminal complaint [PDF] that the Department of Justice filed yesterday.
In that report, the feds allege that KAT is the 69th most-visited site on the Internet, with over 50 million unique visitors each month. That volume means that not only does KAT allegedly cost copyright holders millions, by enabling downloads of first-run movies for free, but also that it's able to take in nearly $17 million in annual advertising revenue. That kind of popularity, combined with a tendency to dismiss valid copyright takedown requests, combined to make KAT an obvious target for law enforcement.
“Websites such as the one seized today brazenly facilitate all kinds of illegal commerce,” said Richard Weber, chief of the IRS's Criminal Investigation unit, in a prepared statement. “[We are] committed to thoroughly investigating financial crimes, regardless of the medium.”
Authorities arrested Vaulin, who is Ukrainian, in Poland, where he now awaits extradition. The Department of Justice seized seven domains affiliated with KAT, all of which are currently down. Law enforcement used a warrant to obtain an email and IP address associated with Vaulin that showed up in multiple iTunes purchases, and was used to log into the official KAT Facebook account. That, combined with a Whois and GoDaddy search, a financial trail, and messages that identified Vaulin's known alias as “KAT's purported ‘Owner,'" left investigators with little doubt as to his role in the site.
If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each count of criminal copyright infringement and conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement, along with 20 years for conspiracy to commit money laundering. But that's a very big if, says Ira Rothken, a technology-focused lawyer who most notably defended Kim Dotcom during MegaUpload's legal troubles. Authorities shuttered that site in 2012. There are superficial similarities between the two situations—copyright infringement, a lucrative advertising business—but MegaUpload was functionally very different from KAT. The former allowed users to upload any file (including a pirated movie) and create a unique link to share it, while KAT used BitTorrnet's peer-to-peer sharing technology. In other words, MegaUpload housed the files itself; importantly, KAT did not.
“We're not aware of any case in the history of the United States where hyperlinking, or the use of torrent files, was ever found to be direct [copyright] infringement,” says Rothken. “In my view, without direct infringement you can't have a criminal infringement.” Instead, Rothken says, torrent-related copyright cases have historically fallen under the purview of civil courts.
“There are no content files on KickassTorrents,” says Rothken. “They're just linking information.” He points to a case like MGM Studios vs Grokster, in which the Supreme Court held that peer-to-peer file-sharing companies could be sued for any infringement that happens under their auspices.
“One infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement, and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise the right to stop or limit it,” wrote since-retired Justice David Souter in a unanimous opinion. That latter phrase certainly seems to apply to KAT, which Rothken says is all the more reason it should be a civil, not criminal case. In fact, Rothken says, it's possible that authorities are using KAT as a test case, to exert greater control over how torrents are regulated.
“There's no doubt that this has the tell-tale signs of a test criminal case,” says Rothken. “If the defense prevails, then the Department of Justice can point to this scenario to tell Congress there may be a need to update the criminal copyright laws.” And if KAT loses, there's now legal precedent to bring criminal charges against torrent operators. (The most famous precursor to the KAT case, the Pirate Bay, was tried in Sweden, and was a joint criminal and civil procedure).
As for the domains, those listed by the Department of Justice all appear to be down, but a cursory Google search turns up least one active site appears to house an unofficial mirror of KAT. It's just one of several sites claiming to house a copy of KAT, many of which may simply be password traps, as TorrentFreak notes.
Individual users of KAT while it existed likely don't have much to fear in terms of criminal liability. It's very hard to prove direct infringement in the context of a torrent site, Rothken says. Still, proceed with caution.
“To the extent that anyone is acting in a way that's risky, it would be likely that the site's being highly monitored by a governmental authority,” says Rothken.
In other words, now's not a great time to use KAT—or to be the guy who allegedly ran it. And if the case ends with a conviction, it's going to be a bad time for torrents all around.

For Facebook users, 58 gender options wasn't enough.
So starting today, the site is letting users type in anything they want in the gender field of their profiles.
Anything. Just as long as it's not offensive, probably—Facebook declined to provide details on the review process.
Just over a year ago, the choices were male, female, or nothing. Then the site rolled out a dropdown menu with 56 more options—things like Cis Female, Transfeminine, Two-Spirit, and Androgyne. Now that dropdown menu will still appear, but you'll also be able to override it with your own term, like “femme.”

The changes show just how progressive this generation's views on gender identity have become. Last month, Fusion asked 1,000 people between the ages of 18 and 34 whether gender was binary (i.e. male/female) or more like a spectrum. Half said it was more like a spectrum.
Last year's additions went over well with LGBT users, but “the main was request was to expand it,” says Ari Chivukula, a Facebook engineer who is part of team referred to as the “custom gender team.” (Chivukula did not say how many people are on that team.)

“A lot of people still felt constrained by the options,” said Oliver Haimson, a researcher who studies social media and online identities at UC Irvine. “Facebook is just such an integral part of people's lives.”
Facebook wouldn't provide any data on how many people have been using the gender options announced last year. But in 2014 Haimson surveyed 371 individuals who had transitioned after joining Facebook.
The most popular identity by far was “genderqueer,” followed by trans and trans woman.

For now, only a small group of Facebook's 1.39 billion users have the new DIY gender selection tool: the new free-form fields are only available in the U.S. English-language version.
October 31st was a Friday and despite the fact there was already plenty of reason to celebrate because it was Halloween and the end of my work week, it was also the opening day of Ohio's Comic-Con as a part of the Wizard Con circuit. I clocked out of work, threw on some jeans and my Attack on Titan Survey Corps shirt and headed straight for the convention, since there were precious hours left for the day. Once I made it down there, grabbed my press pass (weoutchea) and made it to the floor, it was as I expected: steeped in glorious geekery. As Leslie had written about so eloquently before, not everyone can make it to New York or San Diego for the mother and father of all Cons in North America, and the smaller ones definitely have value.
As this was my first year attending, I was just trying to make the rounds and soak in as much as I could without committing to anything or really planning on writing about it (you see how that worked out). At some point, between my buying an original sketch of Master Chief and taking a picture of a homie in an awesome Deathstroke cosplay (Arkham: Origins edition), a guy came up to me pointing emphatically. “Awesome shirt man!” I thanked him, but it is in fact an awesome shirt, so I get that a lot.
“Check this out.” He put a long box on the table in front of us and pulled out a replica Survey Corps blade. While not sharpened steel, it was solid metal and polished, a nice collectible whether you intended to hang it on the wall or wander into the woods beyond Columbus and hunt titans. I nerded out with my new found friend and enthusiast for a moment before making my way to the very display he had made the purchase from.
The table was glorious, just about every bladed weapon from nerd lore were on the tables, all handled with care, all available for a price. There was Jon Snow's “Longclaw”, Cloud Strife's “Buster sword”, Nariko's “Heavenly Sword” and many, many more. I picked up “Buster” and marveled at its weight. This thing was awesome. I had no idea where I would put it, but that doesn't mean I didn't contemplate dropping some credits on it. I mean, come on: FINAL FANTASY VII MEMORABILIA!
And then, I got really, really sober and put it down. I smiled at the vendor, told him how great all the stuff looked, then walked away. Maybe it was because I had just seen this tumblr post of tweets collected from Carrie McClain. Maybe it was because the autopsy of 22-year-old Darrien Hunt, the cosplayer in Utah was just released and confirmed that he was shot at least six times by police, at least four of them in his back. Suddenly, the idea of carrying around a giant sword wasn't as appealing.
I want to be clear and realistic about something: I am aware of two things simultaneously. I am uber-aware of the violence against black men and boys based solely upon the fact that someone was scared of them by default. I talk about that a lot, constantly really, because Trayvon and Jordan and Michael and Darrien and…and…and… happen a lot. Constantly, really. But I am also aware of my personal disposition. As a physical stature, I am included in that bullshit Ben Stein would call “armed with my big scary self.” But I also don't look like I'm in my early 20s either. Maybe my life has been saved multiple times without my knowing because some cop or 2nd amendment lifer thought that older translated to “not as much of a threat.” Who knows what magical combination of black and wide shoulders and greying beard unlocks the secret of being black and safe to exist.
Because I don't know that answer and because I'm less willing to die or put myself in harm's way to prove a point (as I once was) and more concerned of its impact on my wife and daughter, I'm at least aware of unnecessary risks. No matter how mind-boggling fucked that is. And that's the point really. How the fuck is it that my Friday night Comic-Con experience is hijacked by me doing the math on if I could get to my car with a giant, cartoonish sword strapped across my back?
Why is this something that concerns me at all? It sure as hell didn't concern the cool white dude who showed me his Levi-blade earlier. If I ran into him again and if he asked me if I picked one up myself, I wouldn't know how to tell him about my reluctance to open myself up to possible harm. I wouldn't know how to engage him on a level that says, “I'm glad we met and share an affinity for this same piece of art, but because I'm Black and aware of the world around me, I don't feel comfortable indulging myself at the same level you do.” It's a tough conversation to have. It's a tougher situation to articulate. It's toughest though, just trying to live with that doubt in your head.
We were probably naïve for a while. Even people such as myself that talk about the violence towards black bodies in all manners or aggression, thought that nerd shit was off-limits or at least not viewed as a threat. “It's a costume!” we would all yell in our glass cases, now fogged and yet unbroken with our exasperation. Darrien Hunt changed that.
And we didn't need him to be shot in the back while running for his life AWAY FROM COPS that had their guns drawn on him, but it's a lesson we learned nonetheless. The name, Black Nerd Problems originated from funny vignettes that Omar Holmon and I used to trade back and forth that really had to do with relating our nerdom to other people. Like, “If she legit thinks Gotham is the new ‘The Wire'…” #BlackNerdProblems (from Omar Holmon).
It was fun and comical and facetious. But a real Black Nerd Problem is not knowing if your cosplay will get you killed. Or if phaser equals wallet equals 41 empty shell casings later. Or feeling compelled to write this column in the first place.

To the remainer, and even to the neutral, our current politics contains a big mystery. Put simply, where is the sentiment we hoped to call regrexit? Where is the collective outbreak of buyer's remorse? After all, the evidence that Brexit will be the greatest error in our national history since Munich is piling up. It's not just that a process the leavers used to say would be quick and easy is proving to be long and torturously difficult, or that the European economies are growing while ours is sluggish. It's more fundamental than that.
The United States was never immune to fascism. Not then, not now | David Motadel Read more
It's the fact that ending free movement will deprive our hospitals of nurses, our old-age homes of care workers and our farms of essential workers: recruitment of EU nurses is already down 96%, while farmers are already warning of food rotting in the fields.
It's the contradictions, which are legion. We did this supposedly to stop sending money to the EU, yet now we're negotiating over how many tens of billions we'll pay into Brussels coffers (this time getting nothing in return). We did this to make parliament supreme once more, yet now Brexit necessitates a withdrawal bill that would see a massive shift of power away from MPs, as the executive grabs enough unchecked authority to make a Tudor king blush.
The Brexiteers tacitly concede this reality through their quiet dropping of the old promises. No longer do they insist that leaving will bring eternal sunshine. Now the best they can offer is the glum hope that things might, eventually, be no worse than if we stayed. Witness the pro-leave economist Andrew Lilico confidently telling the BBC earlier this summer that the country might recover from the transitional pain of Brexit by 2030.
When the best that can be said for leaving is that it might one day be as good as remaining, and when the worst points to national catastrophe, you might expect the public mood to shift. And yet the polls detect little sign of change. Overall, the two camps are broadly where they were on referendum day, with few leave voters having changed their mind.
The explanation surely lies in the nature of the 2016 vote. Remainers may wish it to have been based on a calm assessment of empirical evidence, so that fresh evidence now would shift opinions. But it wasn't like that. Much of what drove that vote, like all votes, was emotion. This was remain's weakness. And it still is.
Even now, anti-Brexiteers struggle to articulate a case that matches the emotional power of “take back control”. It certainly resonates when you say that it's wrong to shrink the horizons of a generation of young Britons, who will now be denied easy access to an entire continent. But the deepest emotional argument for remain looked not to the future, but to the past. It centred on the second world war.

It contemplated the long, lethal history of Europe and saw the European Union as the answer. For a continent that had been gripped by the fever of nationalism and hatred, the EU proved to be an antidote, soothing the brow with its spirit of co-operation and sharing of sovereignty. The Britain that had fought two world wars surely was obliged to cherish, rather than risk, this remedy to the European disease.
That argument barely flew in the referendum campaign. When David Cameron tried it, Boris Johnson mocked him for it. But mentioned even less was the conflict that followed 1945: the cold war that divided Europe with a wall and left the continent – and the world – in the permanent shadow of nuclear apocalypse. Its absence was strange, given that it had been Britain, and especially the British Conservative party, that after the cold war was over had seen the EU as the means to bind together a once-ruptured Europe. It was the Tories who pushed for EU enlargement, to include the ex-communist nations of the east. Once again, the EU's mission was to heal a continent shattered by conflict.
A reminder of that vision has come this week not from a politician or pro-remain pamphleteer, but a fictional character. George Smiley, who lived the cold war in the shadows, returns in John le Carré's masterful new novel, A Legacy of Spies. He makes a fleeting, enigmatic appearance in which he asks himself what was it all for. “I'm a European,” he says. “If I had an unattainable ideal, it was of leading Europe out of her darkness towards a new age of reason.”
Smiley, a veteran of both the hot war against fascism and the cold war against Soviet communism, had known that darkness first-hand. But for those who voted in last year's EU referendum, perhaps it all seemed too long ago. Those demons were slain, the EU no longer needed.
Still, if that's how it looked on 23 June 2016, it looks different now. In a talk on Thursday night, Le Carré spoke of the behaviour of Donald Trump and others as “absolutely comparable” to the rise of fascism in the 1930s. “It's contagious, it's infectious. Fascism is up and running in Poland and Hungary. There's an encouragement about,” he said.
John le Carré on Trump: ‘Something seriously bad is happening' Read more
This is a warning to take seriously. Hungary is indeed led by a man who boasts that he is building an “illiberal state”, while Poland's government is trampling over fundamental democratic protections, including an independent judiciary and freedom of the press (and Trump is cheering them on as they do so).
The US president is not making America great again, but he is making the 1930s current again. Perhaps, then, and in a way he would not want, Trump is providing the anti-Brexiteers with the one thing they always lacked: an emotional heart to their argument. Trump and the fascist contagion is reminding us why the EU exists: to ensure that the neighbourhood we live in is never again consumed by the flames of tyranny and hatred.
On that fateful day in June 2016, it's possible that some of those who voted leave did so because they believed that democracy and peace were now safe and secure in Europe. In the short time that has passed since, we have seen that those things are, in fact, fragile. As the head of Nato warns that the world is at its most dangerous point in a generation, Britain's duty, to use a word that might make Smiley wince, is surely to defend the body that helped lead Europe out of its darkness. Instead, we are turning our backs and walking away.

The real (?) Bradley Cooper on January 25, 2016, in New York City, not Sundance. Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images
There's a hoodlum on the loose at the Sundance Film Festival, and his given name is Cradley Booper. On Monday, Page Six reported that a Bradley Cooper doppelgänger was attempting to use his lookalike's identity to gain entrance to exclusive parties at the annual Park City, Utah hobnob:
We're told the doppelgänger talked his way into a bash for the film White Girl at Bar 53 at Rock and Reilly's on Saturday, but organizers “quickly caught on.”
“He said, ‘You're done for!' and would not give ID,” said a spy of the “star” when he was confronted by security. “He pushed a button on an iPhone and had a picture of The Hangover as his screensaver.”
So, his plan wasn't airtight—but who could have known that fancy actor types don't use screenshots from their films as party identification? “You're done for” certainly sounds like the kind of thing a celebrity would yell if his identity were in question. Booper would not be deterred: People found a source who claimed the impersonator tried his hand at the Morris from America afterparty, too.
Thanks to the expert sleuthing of a Jezebel commenter, the doppelgänger's face—that of a goofier, wide-eyed, less angular Cooper—has been revealed:
This image confirms what I'd always imagined of Sundance: that it's full of people wandering around drunk and starry-eyed, so primed to run into a famous face that they'll post a Snapchat screenshot on Instagram with just about anybody in a beanie.
But if this imposter isn't Bradley Cooper, who is he, and what is he doing at the festival? There are two likely options. He could be a Park City townie who's tried every year since Wedding Crashers to get into the swanky parties like a kid with a fake I.D., poor thing. Or, he's a cocky out-of-towner who's been growing some stubble and aging alongside Cooper, saving up for a plane ticket and waiting patiently until their forms aligned enough for him to just about pass. Dim-lit, snowy, besweatered Sundance would be the perfect spot for such a con, out of the spotlight of L.A. where club security can easily separate celebrities from the rest of us.
The real Bradley Cooper has no films at Sundance this year, and he performed at an Arthur Miller Foundation event in New York City on Monday night, so he's not around to give his impersonator a stern talking-to or warn the who's-who of the identity theft in progress. Booper may have a bright future in fantasy videos or D-grade spoofs co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio's doppelgänger, a Swedish bartender who's never abused his God-given powers à la Booper. That may be his best shot at stardom. Park City bouncers might buy the beard-and-beanie act, but the Illuminati's a much tougher sell.
WA Premier Colin Barnett calls Fremantle 'disloyal' for axing Australia Day celebrations
Updated
WA Premier Colin Barnett says he is "extremely disappointed" by the City of Fremantle's decision to axe its Australia Day celebrations.
Fremantle has abandoned its Australia Day festivities in favour of what it describes as a culturally inclusive alternative celebration two days later.
The council voted in January to can its Australia Day fireworks display and replace it with a new event, called One Day.
It said it wanted to celebrate being Australian in a way that included all Australians, and believed moving away from the January 26 date was more in line with Fremantle's values.
Mr Barnett has made it clear he does not support the move.
"I am extremely disappointed in the Mayor and the City of Fremantle for doing that," he said.
"It's disloyal to our country, it's disloyal to our state, and I think it's disloyal to the community of Fremantle.
"There are people from all over the world who live in Fremantle and we come together as one people, one country on Australia Day — no one should undermine that.
"Everyone understands the history and the debate about Australia Day but Australia Day is our national day, most Aboriginal groups accept it and history is put to one side.
"Australia Day is now a day for all Australians — whatever their background, wherever they were born — and I think any group that tries to detract from that does a disservice to our country and to our people, all of our people."
The City of Fremantle has previously said the move has the support of Aboriginal people in the Fremantle area and denies the council is trying to be politically correct.

Imagine an Internet with fast lanes that you -- not your cable company -- controlled.
That's what AT&T is proposing to the Federal Communications Commission in an attempt to bridge the gap between regulation-wary industry groups and net neutrality advocates who want strong government protections for the open Internet.
Net neutrality — the idea that Internet service providers (ISPs) shouldn't speed up, slow down or manipulate consumers' Web traffic — has been the subject of intense lobbying from both sides in recent weeks as we've raced toward a final deadline for public comments at the FCC. Last week, grass-roots groups sent hundreds of thousands of new comments to the agency, with many advocating that chairman Tom Wheeler begin regulating ISPs like telephone companies in an attempt to ban them from charging content companies a special toll to access consumers. (Net neutrality advocates worry that such a system would tilt the Internet economy against startups and small businesses that couldn't afford to pay, and put more money in the hands of large Internet providers.)
The path forward for AT&T's idea — which has been discussed before — is uncertain. Still, it's attracted some cautious approval from consumer groups, in a sign that some are still interested in a compromise amid what's become a major ideological fight in Washington over the future of the Internet.
Here's what AT&T's proposal looks like: In a recent meeting with FCC officials, AT&T's senior vice president for regulatory policy laid out a plan that would allow individual consumers to ask that some applications, such as Netflix, receive priority treatment over other services, such as e-mail or online video games. That's different from the FCC's current proposal, which tacitly allows Internet providers to charge content companies for priority access to consumers but doesn't give the consumers a choice in the matter.
"Such an approach would preserve the ability of Internet service providers to engage in individualized negotiations with [content companies] for a host of services, while prohibiting the precise practice that has raised 'fast lane' concerns," said AT&T in its filing.
AT&T's idea would still allow for commercial deals between companies. But they would have to be arranged as the result of one or more subscriber requests; the ISPs couldn't offer fee-based prioritization just because they wanted to.
Some net neutrality advocates say they're heartened by the proposal.
"I am encouraged that people are coming up with creative solutions and not going to the extreme yes-no position," said Nuala O'Connor, president and chief executive of the Center for Democracy and Technology.
But it's unclear how the proposal would actually be implemented. Would Internet companies pay broadband providers on a per-subscriber basis depending on who asked for priority access? Or would company such as Netflix pay one single rate for all users on a company's network?
Also ambiguous is whether AT&T's proposal, if adopted, would stand up to a court challenge from opponents. Some believe the idea may be too clever by half. When the FCC's original net neutrality rules were struck down by a three-judge panel in January, the court's opinion said that there would be no way for the FCC to completely ban Internet fast lanes while still regulating Internet providers under Title I of the Communications Act. (Reclassifying ISPs under Title II of the FCC's congressional charter would, according to some advocates, give the FCC the power to ban paid prioritization. Whether that's the case is a whole other debate.)
What AT&T is suggesting is that Wheeler could ban fee-based prioritization of Internet traffic under certain conditions — namely, in cases where customers hadn't asked for it. Presumably under the AT&T proposal, ISPs would advertise heavily to consumers encouraging them to ask for paid prioritization of certain services.
According to Matt Wood, policy director for the consumer advocacy group Free Press, this approach would be promising if it actually prevented what net neutrality advocates fear most — an unequal playing field that favored the largest Internet companies and broadband providers. But Wood is skeptical that the proposal will pass legal muster.
"It's kind of a nice try by AT&T," said Wood, "and we agree with the first premise that if it were user-directed without paid prioritization, that could be okay." But, he added, "it's a complicated word game they're playing."
A close read of the D.C. Circuit court's opinion on net neutrality suggests Wood could have a point. Even if the FCC says that users can tell ISPs to favor some traffic over others, that might still amount to the FCC overstepping its authority to regulate ISPs under Title I.
"A limited exception permitting end users to direct broadband providers to block certain traffic by no means detracts from the common carrier nature of the obligations imposed on broadband providers," the court opinion reads.
In plain English, the FCC isn't allowed to impose "common carrier" obligations on ISPs because they're regulated differently from phone companies. So AT&T's proposal might face some trouble there. But it's a fascinating one, nonetheless.

Abstract A simple aqueous extraction method for the isolation and identification of psilocin from Psilocybe Cubensis mushrooms is reported. This method employs a dephosphorylation of the phosphate ester to psilocin, which facilitates a greater product yield and simplifies identification. Psilocin extracted by this method is sufficiently concentrated and free of co-contaminants to allow identification by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
The tryptamines are one of four categories of hallucinogenic indoles in more than 20 classes of indole compounds comprising approximately 600 alkaloids1. Considerable research has been conducted with psilocin and psilocybin since their isolation by Hofmann et. al.2 Several extraction techniques1,3-6 have been used to isolate psilocin and psilocybin from more than two dozen species of mushrooms in four genera (Conocybe. Panaeolus, Psilocybe, Stropharia). The techniques that use methanol co-extract other compounds such as urea, ergosterol, ergosteral peroxide, α,α-trehalose, baeocystin, and norbaeocystin3,4,7. At present, a useful aqueous extraction procedure has not been reported for psilocin and psilocybin.
The dephosphorylation of psilocybin to psilocin in vivo has been well documented1,8,9 and is thought to account for most or all of its central nervous system activity8. Conversion of psilocybin to psilocin is also necessary for aqueous extraction with organic solvents because of the very low lipid solubility of psilocybin. Extraction of only one compound also permits infrared analysis of the extract.
Concentration and detectability of psilocin and psilocybin are dependent on several variables, including:
The absence of glucose, which will prevent the production of psilocybin 10 Low levels of ammonium succinate, which will give poor yields of psilocybin 10 The growing medium, which requires a pH of less than 7 10 Timing: maximum production of psilocybin occurs on the seventh day after germination, while maximum production of the mycelium is reached by the ninth day 10 Temperature: complete loss of psilocin and psilocybin will occur in harvested mushrooms left at room temperature for an extended period of time 3 Oxidation: psilocin will oxidize to a blue product (possibly accounting for the bluing color in the four genera containing psilocin and psilocybin) 9
Because of the increasing popularity of these mushrooms and kits available from drug oriented publications for growing mushrooms containing psilocin and psilocybin in cow manure a simple aqueous extraction procedure has been developed that extracts reasonably pure psilocin from mature mushrooms. This extraction method greatly simplifies the identification of psilocin from those mushrooms by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GS/MS).
Experimental A representative sample of 2 to 10g of dried mushrooms is ground to a fine powder by mortar and pestle. The powder is mixed with 100 mL of dilute acetic acid in a 250-mL beaker. The pH is readjusted to pH 4 with glacial acetic acid. After standing 1 h, the beaker is placed in a boiling water bath for 8 to 10 min or until the internal temperature of the acid mixture reaches 70°C. The beaker is removed and cooled to room temperature under running water. The acid mixture is separated from the mushroom powder by suction filtration using glass wool. The filtrate is brought to pH 8 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide and quickly extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. Gentle mixing instead of shaking should be used to prevent an emulsion. The ether is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under nitrogen with no applied heat. Crude psilocin will appear as a greenish residue. Recrystallization from chloroform/heptane (1:3) yields white crystals. The resulting powder can then be submitted to infrared and mass spectral analyses.
Results and Discussion
This method permits rapid isolation of psilocin from hallucinogenic mushrooms by co-extraction of both psilocin and psilocybin. Dilute acetic acid is an excellent solvent for this purpose, because both compounds are very soluble in acetic acid11 and very little of other interfering substances are extracted, It is most likely some other compounds are co-extracted but are removed from psilocin in the ether extraction from the aqueous base. Psilocybin is completely dephosphorytated to psilocin by heating the acid extract. In addition of the base, extraction into ether should be performed promptly, because of decomposition of psilocin at a greater pH than 712. The extraction and dephosporylation steps produce reasonably pure psilocin from a small amount of mushroom material. Two grams of mushrooms will often be sufficient to obtain an infrared spectrum of psilocin (Fig. 1). Smaller mushrooms exhibits provide ample psilocin for mass spectral analysis (Fig. 2).
This method has been used in our laboratory for six months and has given excellent results in separating psilocin from methanol-soluble compounds. Other identification techniques such as gas chromatography and microcrystalline tests are possible on psilocin extracted by this method.
Kristin Barton spent her summer wrenching weeds out of the ground, hacking through tangled overgrowth with machetes, and crawling through thorny shrubs—all while conducting undergraduate research vital to the understanding and preservation of biodiversity on campus.
“When I think of Appalachia and this area, I think of high biodiversity,” Barton said. “Everyone always says that, as a botany student, I'm in a perfect place. And that's true; but as exotic invasive plants spread, biodiversity is decreasing. That's not good.”
Exotic invasive plants, like the infamous kudzu vine, are notorious for competing with native plants for resources to survive—and winning.
“Oriental bittersweet, for instance, is a woody vine that can contribute to tree fall,” explained Jen Rhode Ward, associate professor of biology. “It winds around trees and connects them, so if one tree falls down in a wind or snow event, it drags other trees down with it. Because oriental bittersweet makes so many berries, there's a seed bank of oriental bittersweet. When it knocks down trees suddenly there's sunlight, and more oriental bittersweet comes in.”
UNC Asheville's campus is home to several rare native species, such as shooting star, black cohosh, and several types of orchids. Many of these plants have medicinal properties. But when exotic invasive plants like oriental bittersweet take over an area, the biodiversity of that area decreases, and the native plants that naturally provide better wildlife habitat and healthier soil dynamics die out.
Experience In the Field
Students and faculty in the Biology Department began research on how best to deter exotic invasives on campus six years ago. They observed plots in two areas on campus: Pisgah Forest, near the chancellor's residence, and Chestnut Ridge, near Lookout Observatory. They've experimented with various combinations of mechanical removal—pulling the exotics up by hand—and chemical treatments.
Barton found her hands-on work in this research presented different challenges and opportunities than work in the classroom.
“It differed tremendously,” Barton said. “Being out there, you're not only doing the research and getting that experience, but you get the hands-on aspect and an understanding of the process. You have an idea and you try to execute it, you're going to run into problems. You have to problem-solve constantly.”
The findings by the undergraduate researchers also are used by students in botany classes, Ward said, allowing more students to participate in data collection and analysis.
“This is such a good teaching resource,” Ward said. “Every student gets to contribute to data that makes a big difference in how we choose to manage our land.”
Continuing to Grow
While the student and faculty researchers have already learned a lot about effectively dealing with exotic invasive plants, the project has plenty of room to grow.
“We wrote a 20-year plan for this project,” Ward said. “One weakness in current research is that everyone does the study for one year. The strength of our previous study was that it lasted for five years.
“In our new plots, we actually have some that are supposed to be treated every year for the next 20 years, some that are supposed to be treated every three years, and some that are not supposed to be treated at all, so we can see the differences in that.”
They're also contributing information to the Global Invader Impact Network (GIIN), a project operated by Virginia Tech's invasive plant ecology lab.
“That compares sites from all around the country and the world to try to determine the best principles for controlling invasive exotics,” Ward explained. “Our long-range goal is to get a bigger picture and to collaborate on these big data collection efforts.”
Barton has big plans for her future, as well, which she'll kick off with a trip to work in a biological research station in Central America with her fellow student researcher, Matt Jasper.
“I'm hoping to go to grad school, get a Ph.D., and do research,” Barton said. “I think I've pretty much fallen in love with research.”

Project Summary:
We have designed an Oscilloscope using PC and Arduino Board. The signal is first of all fed to the Arduino Board where the analog signal is converted to a digital signal by the ADC which is then serially outputted to the PC and is read by the MATLAB software via the COM ports. Here the signal is read in the form of digital data but then is converted to analog one by using the resolution of the ADC used by the Arduino Board. The MATLAB software was then used to plot the signals.
Full Project:
The input to be plotted is given to one of the five analog pins in the board. The software used for interfacing the board with the PC is Matlab R2012a. The compiler Arduino 1.0 has been used for uploading the codes to the board. The MAX 232 Line Driver and ATmega328 Processor has been used. The various components used in this designing has been illustrated briefly in the coming sections.

AMERICA'S health authorities are desperate for solutions to the country's growing opioid scourge. Every day more than 90 Americans die from overdoses. About 2m have a drug addiction related to opioids prescribed by doctors for pain relief. Many turn to heroin and other illicit drugs as a result. It is now clear that stopping doctors from prescribing opioids too readily is essential if addictions and deaths are to be curbed.
A new study by Molly Schnell and Janet Currie from Princeton University crunched data on all opioid prescriptions written in America in 2006-14. They found a striking link: doctors trained in higher-ranked medical schools wrote far fewer opioid prescriptions than those trained in lower-ranked schools (or, surprisingly, osteopaths, whom you might expect to avoid using pharmaceuticals whenever possible).

This pattern held when the researchers compared doctors in the same speciality who practised in the same county—which suggests that the pattern is not caused by graduates from better schools seeing patients with medical problems that are less likely to require opioids. Nor does it appear to be simply a matter of graduates from more selective schools being generally more diligent: as these schools became more selective over time, their alumni did not grow more parsimonious with painkillers relative to peers from less prestigious institutions. This suggests that training plays a role.
The link with school rank was particularly striking for general practitioners, who write about half of all opioid prescriptions. The authors calculate that if all GPs had prescribed opioids at the same rate as those who graduated from Harvard, the top-ranked medical school (whose graduates are also the least enthusiastic prescribers), there would have been 56% fewer prescriptions and 9% fewer deaths resulting from overdoses.
There is no single solution to stopping America's opioid epidemic. But training doctors to avoid unnecessary prescriptions is a good place to start.
The folk music of Thailand's northeastern Isaan region is known as morlum and it follows a familiar theme. Typically, a young, wet-behind-the-ears girl or boy leaves the emerald rice paddies to move to the big city. Once there, facing exploitation, social estrangement, and heartbreak, the protagonist yearns for the pastoral wholesomeness of their birthplace.
It's a tale many in Thailand's largest region can relate to. “When you live in upcountry Thailand, everywhere you go — your neighbor's house, restaurants, the market, taxis — that's the music that they play,” says singer Christy Gibson, who grew up listening to morlum and its close relative luk thung after moving to Isaan with her parents at the age of 6, and is one of the few foreign musicians to have made it in the Thai mainstream.
But despite making up a third of the population, the people of Isaan — who share a culture and language closer to neighboring Laos — have for centuries been second-class citizens to the inhabitants of Bangkok and central provinces, who often are descended from Chinese stock. And although it is the rice-bowl of a country that, until recently, was the world's largest exporter of the grain, the region has historically suffered from chronic underdevelopment.
As a result, local people traditionally headed south to Bangkok or the country's tourist zones to work as taxi drivers or construction workers, often returning home to help at harvest time. Many women, weary of toiling under the hot sun for a pittance, ended up working in the sex industry.
In recent times, though, Isaan has experienced a comparative upturn in fortunes, with new investment transforming the area into a manufacturing hub. In the villages, rickety wooden houses are being rebuilt in concrete, with shiny pickup trucks parked outside. In the cities, glitzy shopping malls, boasting ice-skating rinks and global coffee chains, are the hangouts of spiky-haired teens in fashionable streetwear.
The upshot? “Isaan people have become cosmopolitan villagers who have sophisticated understandings of themselves as Thai and as participants in a global labor force,” says Charles Keyes, professor emeritus at the University of Washington and author of a recent book on Thailand's northeast.
But not is all well. The successive ousting of Isaan-backed governments by the Bangkok-based political establishment is reinforcing the sense of ethnic difference and consolidating a political identity for Isaan alongside its cultural and linguistic ones. And following Thailand's latest military coup on May 22, many Isaan people are calling for greater autonomy — even independence.
“There's a generalized anger at the military government,” says David Streckfuss, an American scholar based in the Isaan city of Khon Kaen, who has studied Thai culture for over 25 years. “Civil war is never a plan, it's an outcome of bad choices,” he adds. But “it's not unimaginable, as there is so much pent-up anger.”
Isaan identity, just like morlum, has long been distinct. “Isaan migrants tend to live together, to speak Lao with each other, to listen to Isaan popular music, and, most of all, send money to relatives at home,” says Keyes. “Identification as khon isaan, northeastern people, is a primary identity even for those who have lived outside the region for years.”
Colonialism has fed this dynamic. Once the French gained control of Lao in 1893, they quickly noted that those living across the Mekong also spoke the same language as their new subjects, and attempted to unite all Lao under Gallic rule. Siam, as Thailand was then known, took umbrage and in 1904 reclassified all ethnic Lao within its borders as Thai — “just an inferior sort of Thai,” explains Streckfuss.
Nearly a century later, the differences were still great enough for telecoms mogul Thaksin Shinawatra to make a political career out of them. Though he was not born in Isaan and was in fact of Chinese descent (his mother came from a Hakka family and his great-grandfather was a migrant from China's Guangdong province), Thaksin shrewdly decided to champion the region's rural poor. He was elected Prime Minister in 2001 largely on their votes, in return for which he initiated populist policies such as microfinance loans, fuel subsidies and universal health care.
But Thailand's entrenched elite soon tired of this parvenu, accusing him of buying votes from gullible bumpkins and even of angling to replace the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej as the object of popular adoration. Despite an unprecedented re-election in 2005, Thaksin was ousted in a military putsch the following year. He was convicted of corruption in absentia — charges he insists are politically motivated — and remains in exile.
“He's a businessman, sometimes insensitive to social plights, but that's the extent [of wrongdoing] that I've seen,” Thaksin's former spokesman, Jakrapob Penkair, told a recent luncheon meeting at Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club. “If he has committed any crime, it is the crime of being naive — of believing that Thailand was already a democracy.”
Thaksin's popularity in the northeast has endured despite his ousting, and parties he backs have won every election this millennium, only to be removed twice by the military and three times by the courts. A popular movement, colloquially known as the Red Shirts, developed to demand his return — and a reciprocal royalist Yellow Shirt movement emerged to resist it.
The color-coded rivalry between them has convulsed Thailand for nigh on a decade now, with sporadic bloodletting claiming scores of lives and leaving thousands injured. This, in turn, has intensified the antipathy between the capital and Isaan. This became especially bitter during the six-month-long Shutdown Bangkok demonstrations that began last November, when Yellow Shirt protesters demanded the ousting of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin's sister, on the pretext that the northeasterners who elected her were too stupid to be trusted with the vote.
“In February, I was hearing 20-minute rants about the history of the Laos and how they were repressed — how [the Thais] came up on horses and put chains around our necks and dragged us away,'” says Streckfuss. This newfound pride wasn't about identifying with fellow Lao people across the Mekong, he adds, “it was anti-Bangkok.”
That the Red and Yellow Shirt factions are ethnically, linguistically and geographically distinct has heightened fears of armed conflict. In February, before the coup, Red Shirt leader Suporn Attawong announced plans to recruit 600,000 young men across the 20 northern provinces to join a new progovernment Democracy Protection Volunteers Group. Since the putsch of May 22, caches of weapons have been unearthed alongside stores of Red Shirt propaganda materials. Last week, despite the obvious risk of detention, Red Shirt activist Ittipon Sukpaen threatened civil war on his Facebook page. Weapons are freely available in Thailand: according to one 2011 study, the country has an estimated 10 million firearms in civilian hands.
Even morlum mirrors this changing dynamic, though not in the bellicose way one might expect. “Many of the artists I've spoke to try to use their music as a vehicle for positive reconciliation,” says Gibson, “to say ‘we are all Thais.'” And that is, of course, true. It's just that today — just as it was in the past — some Thais believe they are more Thai than others.

Back in December Yolanda Hadid and David Foster announced plans to split, with former officially filing for divorce in January.
And on Tuesday in a preview for an upcoming episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills - shared exclusively by Entertainment Tonight - David, 66, could be heard sharing his doubts about the couple's relationship.
Though he was off-camera in the clip, microphones still picked up a conversation with David's friend Tom, in which he discussed his 52-year-old ex.
The pair didn't seem to realize they were being recorded as Tom asked if David was feeling better, to which he morosely responded: 'A little, yeah. It's been a stretch.'
Scroll down for video
Caught on tape: In a teaser for an upcoming episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, David Foster, L, seems to have been caught unaware as he discusses doubts about his marriage to now ex Yolanda Hadid, R
His friend then added that he wanted his life to 'get back to the way it was when you first got together.'
David, however, was not so sure that that was even possible, questioning: 'How's that going to happen?'
Following the tense scene, the teaser - which also shows Yolanda looking to be in good spirits as she mingles with friends - featured the mother-of-three lamenting the loss of David's 'wingman.'
'He married a woman that was a social butterfly, always out, and doing and doing … and then all of a sudden, I got sick,' Yolanda said.
Off the hook: The 66-year-old didn't seem to realize he was being recorded, as for most of the scene he was mainly off-camera, with the shot focusing on Kyle Richards's side of the couch, or on David's now ex Yolanda
Whoops! Despite not being the focus of the shot, microphones were still able to catch the dialogue between David and friend Tom, as the former was asked 'Are you feeling better?'
'And you know, [I'm] the shell of the woman I used to be. Yes, he gets impatient. We've been trying to work through all the ups and downs. This is my journey, but unfortunately, it's out of my control.'
Two months after the scene was shot the former couple announced plans to divorce, sharing a statement with People.
'Sadly we have decided to go our separate ways. We've shared nine beautiful and joyous years together,' the statement said.
Wishful thinking: Tom appears to be more hopeful for David's situation, saying he wants his life to 'get back to the way it was when you first got together'
Doubtful: David, however, is not so sure that that outcome is even possible
Feeling better: The downtrodden clip was juxtaposed with shots of Yolanda looking to be in good spirits as she mingled with friends
'During that time we experienced love, friendship and the inevitable challenges that come with managing a marriage, careers, blended families and health issues.'
The statement also read: 'We are grateful for the years we've spent together and believe wholeheartedly that we did our best.'
Earlier this month Yolanda spoke with Dr. Oz about how her struggles with Lyme disease affected her marriage.
Sharing a kiss: Despite the dejected spirit of his conversation with Tom, David was later spotted sharing a kiss with Yolanda at the party
Hard work: In a confessional in the teaser, Yolanda discussed her struggle with Lyme disease, sharing: '[I'm] the shell of the woman I used to be. Yes, he gets impatient. We've been trying to work through all the ups and downs'
Moving on: Two months after this episode was filmed, Yolanda and David (pictured here at the Global Lyme Alliance Gala in October) announced their plans to divorce
'The patient suffers, but the caretakers suffer too,' she shared. 'At the end of the day, David never changed. I changed.'
She continued, of her chronic illness: 'It wasn't a choice, but I'm not the woman I used to be. And I probably never will be again.'
0 BuzzFeed refuses to run Trump ads, pulls out of $1.3M RNC deal
BuzzFeed just cut its advertising agreement with the Republican National Committee and won't run ads for Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
BuzzFeed ended the agreement Monday, which called for the RNC to spend a “significant amount on political advertisements” during the election cycle, according to an internal memo.
“We don't run cigarette ads because they are hazardous to our health, and we won't accept Trump ads for the exact same reason,” wrote BuzzFeed CEP Jonah Peretti.
The agreement between the two was signed in April and called for BuzzFeed to run ads in the fall. But the RNC says it never planned to use BuzzFeed.
RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said “space was reserved on many platforms, but we never intended to use BuzzFeed.”
“It is ironic that they have not ruled out taking money from a candidate currently under investigation by the FBI,” Spicer added, in reference to Hillary Clinton.
BuzzFeed's decision runs counter to most media companies that can turn substantial profits from running political ads. The agreement with the RNC was reportedly worth $1.3 million.
However, Peretti is taking a stand.
“[W]e certainly don't like to turn away revenue that funds all the important work we do across the company,” but this is a “business exception” the company is making, Peretti wrote.

“The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs,” Peretti wrote.
The company says its decision to drop the RNC's ads won't change the site's news coverage. Some are cheering the decision, but critics have long accused the site of having a liberal bias.
Gee I wonder if @BuzzFeed is going to be painted as having a liberal bias that is unfair to donald (note the lowercase "d"). Now we wait... — Phill Hill (@Thrillhouse512) June 6, 2016

At the RSA Conference in San Francisco today, the network penetration testing and monitoring tool company Pwnie Express will demonstrate its newest creation: a sensor that detects rogue cellular network transceivers, including "Stingray" devices and other hardware used by law enforcement to surreptitiously monitor and track cell phones and users.
In an exclusive demonstration for Ars, Pwnie Express CTO Dave Porcello and Director of Research and Development Rick Farina showed off the company's new cell network threat detection capabilities, which integrate into Pwnie's Pulse security auditing service. The capability will give companies the ability to monitor cellular networks around them and detect anomalies caused by rogue cellular base stations, IMSI catchers, and devices used to extend cellular coverage into areas where it may not be authorized.
Of all the potential security threats to companies and individuals that have emerged over the past few years, perhaps the hardest to crack is rogue cellular base stations. Whether they're used to attacking the privacy of a cell phone user's communications or as a backdoor out of places where cell phone usage is restricted, configuring unauthorized cell "towers" has become increasingly simple. It doesn't necessarily even require law enforcement-grade hardware. Anyone with a HackRF card or other software-defined radio kit and open-source software can turn a laptop computer into a cellular network transceiver—or even a cellular jammer.
Call baiting
"The real thing that scares people the most is that we have no visibility into these things," Porcello said. "Nobody knows how many of them are out there." But they definitely are out there. Last September, ESD America—which manufactures the CryptoPhone secure cell phone—reported that more than a dozen rogue cell "towers" had been discovered in Washington DC. It's not clear if all of these were being operated by law enforcement.
Way back in 2010 at the Washington DC Shmoocon security conference, Chris Paget (now known as Kristin Paget) demonstrated that he could capture the cell phone data of attendees using a rig that cost about $1,500. "He just bought a commodity [software-defined radio] card and loaded OpenBTS (an open-source GSM cellular base station software package) on his laptop," Porcello said. "He made a point of using a very small antenna so he only hijacked about half of the audience in the auditorium. I'm sure that this sort of thing was being done before that, but I think that was the first public demonstration."
At the same time, law enforcement use of such systems grew. Using the same principle as malicious cellular base stations, authorities could capture cellular phones' International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) as a way to identify a targeted phone and execute a "man in the middle" attack against it, acting as an intermediary between the phone and a legitimate cell tower in order to intercept and record conversations. These devices, called "IMSI catchers" or "stingrays," have been controversially used by local law enforcement across the US, often under non-disclosure agreements.
Another threat faced by companies in highly regulated industries is the unauthorized use of microcells or femtocells—small base stations often sold by cell carriers to extend cellular network coverage in places where towers might not have coverage. If a company is trying to prevent personal cell phone usage within a facility through passive means, for example, an employee might plug a femtocell base station in at their desk to make outbound calls that aren't through the company's call logging system. This also introduces the potential threat of cellular jamming by someone seeking to block service for malicious reasons.
While all this has been recognized as a threat for some time, there's been one major obstacle in the way of companies protecting themselves against cellular network attacks. Until now, using hardware that could detect such networks would break federal law. There are already some tools available to detect IMSI catchers such as SnoopSnitch, an Android application that can warn a phone user of suspicious cell tower signals that might indicate an IMSI catcher or rogue base station. But other tools available to detect the full spectrum of potential cellular threats are largely restricted to government customers, and many carry six-digit price tags.
"It's actually real easy to make something that can do this but can only be used by government or law enforcement," said Farina. "But so many people have these problems and no way to solve them. If you've got a good sized company, you're absolutely a target for somebody setting up a small base station and grabbing your data, pretty cheaply."
Setting a watchman
Pwnie's cellular threat detection capability is based on FCC-certified cellular transceiver hardware, and it will be integrated into the company's Pwn Pro network sensor line (the corporate version of the Pwn Plug). A 4G cellular transceiver is integrated directly into the device.
"What we're focusing on is the malicious use of cellular—a handful of specific things we can detect passively now," said Porcello. "And there will be a lot more by the time we ship." He added that the rule sets used for identifying some of the potentially malicious behaviors "are pretty rudimentary at this point," and additional work will be required to tune out false positive alerts.
But the rules are good enough now to detect rogue and malicious cellular base stations and IMSI catchers and interceptors with some reliability. "Based on our testing so far, we have some good data to zero out false positives," Farina said. "We're looking for a couple of things right now that we think are reasonable to infer."
The cellular threat detection system looks at a number of factors to determine whether a cellular base station is of concern:
Unauthorized or unknown cell providers. The Mobile Network Code (MNC) and Mobile Country Code (MCC) of the base station and the frequency range they provide service on could be indicators of someone running a rogue base station. They could be from unknown carriers, carriers not authorized to operate in a certain area, or an operator that is "suddenly offering something that shouldn't be available," Farina said.
Anomalous or suspicious base stations. Signal strength variation could indicate a base station has moved or changed its transmitting power. "The standard deviation of power from base stations is relatively sane," said Farina. "We can flag when a base station's signal changes wildly." This will be extended to detect changes in existing cell service, Porcello said, "such as going down to 2G service, for example." New stations suddenly popping up could also set off an alarm, possibly indicating a femtocell or other unauthorized cellular base station.
IMSI catcher/interceptor identification. This is based on whether a base station is advertising itself as a major carrier but provides only 2G service—the surest sign someone is trying to intercept cell data.
Rogue or malicious cellular base stations based on open source software. One of the rule sets in the current capability can detect Yate default base station configurations, indicating someone is configuring a cellular base station as a gateway for phone calls or for malicious purposes.
Reach out and punch someone
Cellular base stations aren't the only mobile network-based attack vector faced by many companies. Cheap and readily available GSM-based devices have found their way into a number of criminal activities. "You're seeing all sorts of rogue devices moving to GSM," Porcello said. "Hackers and criminals are taking advantage of this like crazy because they know you can't legally monitor them."
Porcello cited credit card and ATM skimmers as an example. "The credit card skimmer of choice now is a GSM-connected skimmer. You don't have to be near it and never have to collect it; it can just dump all the credit card numbers by SMS message back to a throwaway phone number."
Eventually, Porcello said, the FCC will have to give companies a way of spotting these sorts of devices without breaking the law. "The FCC is going to have to create some exceptions for companies to monitor this traffic because their workforces are moving to 4G LTE," he said. And with more and more business taking place over cellular broadband, cellular network attacks could become increasingly costly.
Samsung Electronics has received one of the most prestigious awards for environmental sustainability in recognition of its reduction of the carbon footprint of its flagship Galaxy S smartphones.
On October 8, Samsung won the Best in Product Carbon Footprint Prize at the Carbon Trust Standard and Label Bearers Conference and Awards 2015, held by Carbon Trust of the United Kingdom.
Carbon Trust's performance awards have been presented annually for four years, recognizing companies and products that have shown outstanding results in carbon reduction. The win by Samsung is a first for the consumer electronics industry, the result of a reduction in carbon emissions of the Galaxy S smartphones.
Samsung began working with the Carbon Trust in 2012, pledging to certify the carbon footprint of all models within its flagship Galaxy smartphone range. The Galaxy S2 was the first to be certified in 2012, and all Galaxy S and Galaxy Note smartphones up to, including the Galaxy S5, have also been certified. The carbon emission level of the Galaxy S5 has been reduced by 37 percent compared to the Galaxy S2.
Throughout each product's life cycle, from product development to disposal, Samsung Electronics analyzes carbon emissions at each stage and makes efforts to reduce the environmental footprints of its products.
Wouter van Tol, European Head of Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability at Samsung Electronics said, “As the world's leading manufacturer of smartphones, we have a responsibility to minimize our environmental footprint. Being recognized for substantially reducing greenhouse emissions across our flagship range of Galaxy smartphones is a great honor. This is thanks to our PlanetFirst approach, where we consider the environmental impact of everything we manufacture, right from the start. We are committed to an on-going program of lowering our impact on the environment, and look forward to making even further progress in this area in the future.”
Don't plan a funeral for “The Vampire Diaries” just yet. CW President Mark Pedowitz refused to reveal whether Season 8 is the last year for the drama. Rumors have been swirling about the series' fate, but Pedowitz assured “TVD” fans that nothing has been decided.
“In my dreams. it isn't [the end], but we will see how the audience will react,” Pedowitz said of the show at the CW upfront presentation to advertisers (via Deadline). While he hopes “The Vampire Diaries” doesn't get canceled, he added that “no determination” has been made.
Pedowitz also revealed that a comparatively shorter episode order is possible. “The Vampire Diaries” typically has 22 episodes a season, but it's unclear whether that would be the case in Season 8.
Fans of “The Vampire Diaries” are constantly speculating about the series' cancellation or renewal. A move to Friday nights and the loss of lead actress Nina Dobrev had many believing Season 7 would be the drama's swan song. It survived, but the show will continue to lose lead actors.
Kat Graham, who plays Bonnie Bennett, announced that Season 8 would be her last run as the witch. More concerning is Ian Somerhalder's departure. The actor who portrays Damon Salvatore accidentally implied the series would expire with Season 8, but he later revealed he just meant he would be departing at that time.

“Last weekend I talked to an audience at a Q&A about the end of #TVD and how excited I was to make what I believe — my last year — be as great as possible,” Somerhalder wrote on TwitPlus. “Somehow in my infinite wisdom and end-of-season foggy brain, I managed to make it sound like the show was coming to an end.”
Executive producer Julie Plec said this year that she would like to end the show when Somerhalder and Stefan Salvatore actor Paul Wesley are ready to retire their fangs. “My endgame needs to, in my opinion, emotionally run parallel with the endgame of Paul and Ian, more so than the network and the studio,” Plec told Variety in January. “When those boys decide that they're done telling stories — which could be tomorrow and could be a year from now or two years from now or whatever — I need to be done. I feel like I owe them that, and I owe the show that.”
That decision is actually in the hands of the network and the studio, the CW and Warner Bros. They're the ones who have to decide whether “The Vampire Diaries” can survive past Season 8.
“The Vampire Diaries” Season 8 will debut in the fall on the CW and retain its time slot Fridays at 8 p.m. EDT.
Here's a thought experiment, purely hypothetical: What if Stephen Harper had done it?
Imagine that last June, or last September, or last week, the prime minister had convened a rare news conference and announced that henceforth, all Conservative senators, beginning with Irving Gerstein and Marjory LeBreton, would be independent. No more role for them on national campaigns; no more fundraising; no more organizing; no more backroom advice. In an unprecedented, transformative shift, the governing party would gently but firmly shove all its Red Chamber appointees, the quintessential Ottawa insiders, outside the circle of power.
“We tried to push through reform,” our imaginary PM tells the assembled hacks, as we pound frantically away on our smartphones. “The opposition wouldn't allow it. So we made appointments as required under our present system, in order to move democratic, legitimate legislation past illegitimate, unelected Liberal Senate appointees, while respecting advisory Senate elections where they occurred, as in Alberta. We did our best. But that hasn't worked so well either, as we saw all too clearly last year.” More gasps, from the gallery.
“We continue to await the Supreme Court's opinion about what is required, constitutionally, for us to properly reform, or completely abolish the upper house, which as it stands is undemocratic, wasteful and unacceptable. But in the meantime… “
It's impossible to say for certain, obviously, what the response would have been. We can assume, though, that there would have been an overwhelming sense of shock, as there was with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau's announcement last Wednesday. After that? Here's a wild guess. There would have been accolades across the board, and grumpy back-biting from the Opposition, as strategists and pundits marvelled at the PM's coup. A return to the Harper of old, would have been the theme. For how better to reclaim the founding principles of Reform than to irrevocably, publicly sever the party's ties with the “fat cats” in the Senate? Suddenly, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair's calls for abolition would have sounded hollow; and Trudeau's claims to being a democratic reformer? They'd have been lost, amid the excited din.
For the question remains, and it is one that really does transcend partisanship: What can be done about the Senate? We know it offends and annoys most Canadians, when they pause to think about it at all, that 105 appointees can be paid $130,000 each a year to draft policy reports that are ignored, or do party work on the taxpayer's dime. Sen. Gerstein, for one. How, precisely, does he divide his working hours between “Senate business” and Conservative party fundraising? Is there a time sheet?
For this is the root of the problem that came to light last year, thanks primarily to the self-interested manoeuvrings and then self-immolation of Sen. Mike Duffy. In the new post-corporate-donation, post-union-donation, post-federal subsidy world of campaign finance, fundraising must be aggressive and relentless. Under this system, especially, how can a political party resist the temptation to use its sitting senators – many of whom do have a bit of time on their hands, despite their backbreaking schedule – as human cash collectors? Unless, that is, such obvious overlapping interests are banned?
If a referendum on Senate abolition were held today, it's a foregone conclusion that the ‘Yes' would win by an overwhelming margin. It is also true that such abolition would require at least the approval of seven provinces, constituting 50 per cent of the population – and possibly unanimity. Though we have yet to hear from the Supreme Court, the chances of the court's allowing elections and term limits, without a reframing of the Constitution, appear remote. Moreover, imagine the situation if 24 senators from Quebec were elected, and six from Alberta were elected, and all felt entitled – on account of being elected – to not only tweak laws, but write them. How long would that system last?
Fundamental reform (and elections are implicitly fundamental) probably requires that the edifice of the Constitution be taken apart and reassembled. But practically, such a process is anathema; especially at a time when the Parti Quebecois is once again on the ascendant. All across Canada now, as Mulcair declares his openness to doing the “hard work” of constitutional reform, hands clap over ears in horror, to inner visions of Quebec Premier Pauline Marois appearing like the ghost of referendums past, brandishing her list of demands. Constitutional reform is not a “solution” to be embraced – at least not for now. The best, achievable remedy, therefore, is the one recently proposed; voluntary disassociation between the Senate and the parties, and future appointments handled by an arms-length, transparent, non-partisan (or multi-partisan) body, based on merit.
All of which is why, from a Reform Party principle standpoint, from a Conservative standpoint, Trudeau's move, in Harper's hands, would have been nothing short of genius. It could have put him back at the top of the heap. Whereas as things stand — with Trudeau leading — the prime minister has been reduced, once again, to playing defence.

Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires has been elected the 266th pope of the Catholic Church, taking the name Pope Francis.
He is the first Latin American pope to lead the church, as well as the first Jesuit priest.
Francis, 76, appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica on Wednesday more than an hour after white smoke was released from the Sistine Chapel chimney at 2:05 EDT (7:05 p.m. CET) to signal that a new pope had been selected. Speaking from the balcony, he gave his first address as pope, the traditional Urbi et Orbi (to the "City and the World"), as crowds waved, cried and cheered for the new leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.
He prayed for the church, the papacy and for his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI.
"As you know, the duty of the conclave was to appoint a bishop of Rome. It seems to me that my brother cardinals have chosen one who is from far away, but here I am," he said, adding that he thanked the church "for your embrace" as well as the cardinals who elected him.
"First and foremost, I would like to pray for our emeritus pope, Benedict XVI. Let us pray all of us together … so that he's blessed by the Lord and guarded," he said.
Francis was elected to the papacy after two days of conclave meetings with five rounds of voting. Voting in the conclave, which began Tuesday afternoon, is confidential and cardinals were sworn to secrecy, but Francis received at least 77 votes, which is the minimum two-thirds required to become pope. There were 115 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave. All were under age 80 before Benedict's retirement, as required by Vatican rules. In 2005, when Benedict was elected, it took two days and four voting rounds.
The new pope steps into the papacy during a key period of transformation for the Roman Catholic Church. He faces a rising tide of secularism in Europe and western nations, and growth in other parts of the world, including his home continent, South America. During Benedict's tenure, multiple priest abuse scandals rocked the church in several nations, and Francis will have to confront the damage done to the church's reputation. The Vatican is also battling internal political turmoil, including VatiLeaks, the scandal involving a series of confidential Vatican documents released to the media during Benedict's papacy.
Amid changing mores on sexuality, including same-sex marriage, Francis' traditional views have clashed with cultural changes in Argentina. Before the nation legalized same-sex marriage in 2010, Francis called it a “destructive attack on God's plan.”
But Francis, who was rumored in 2005 to be the runner-up to Benedict, also brings a more pastoral sensibility to the church, said the Rev. Raymond J. Kupke, an adjunct professor of church history at Seton Hall University. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, he reportedly rode the bus to work, did his own cooking and visited the poor in Argentine slums. Instead of living in an archbishop's palace, he chose to live in a small room in a downtown Buenos Aires home.
"Francis fills the bill in many regards. Latin American with Italian background, archbishop of one of world's largest diocese, rector of a seminary," said Kupke. "His name choice says a lot. St. Francis spearheaded a new evangelicalism and was a man of simplicity and humility."
It's unclear whether the pope's name is a reference to St. Francis Xavier, a 16th-century priest who was one of the first Jesuits; St. Francis of Assisi, a 13th-century friar who founded the Franciscan order of priests; or St. Francis de Sales, the 17th-century Bishop of Geneva.
The Rev. James Martin, one of the best-known Jesuit priests in the U.S. and the editor-at-large of America magazine, said the "choice of a Jesuit pope fills me with joy ... The name Francis is a clear indication of his desire to focus on the poor."
In a 2007 address at a large meeting of Latin American bishops, Francis emphasized that belief. "We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least," he said. "The unjust distribution of goods persists, creating a situation of social sin that cries out to Heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers."
At the same time, the new pope is expected to uphold church orthodoxy on sexuality, abortion, marriage and contraception. The same year he said same-sex marriage attacks God's plan, he also said gay people adopting children is an act of discrimination against children.
He has also shown compassion for people with HIV and AIDS; in 2001, he visited AIDS patients in a hospice where he washed and kissed the feet of 12 patients.
One of the concerns among church-watchers before the conclave was whether the next pope would be strong enough to reform corruption in the curia, the mostly Italian group of cardinals who run the Vatican. National Catholic Reporter correspondent John Allen Jr. is unsure Francis is the right man for the task.
"Doubts that circulated about Bergoglio's toughness eight years ago may arguably be even more damaging now, given that the ability to govern and to take control of the Vatican bureaucracy seems to figure even more prominently ... Although Bergoglio is a member of several Vatican departments, including the Congregations for Divine Worship and for Clergy, he's never actually worked inside the Vatican, and there may be concerns about his capacity to take the place in hand," he wrote in a profile of the cardinal before he was elected.
Allen also noted the pope's age. At 76, he is two years younger than Benedict was when he was chosen -- significant, considering Benedict resigned Feb. 28 because of old age and declining health.
Judy Jones, an American who is associate director the Survivors Network for Those Abused By Priests, said the group is keeping a close eye on Francis and wants him to "show the world that the sexual abuse of children and cover-up of abuse will not be tolerated." Ahead of the conclave, SNAP released two lists of 15 cardinals it was "most worried about becoming the next pope." Francis was not on the list and Jones said the knows "very little about this pope."
Terence McKiernan, the president of BishopAccountability.org, an organization that tracks bishops' records on clergy abuse, had more pointed words about Francis.
"There is some evidence that Bergoglio is well aware that rebuilding the church will entail much more work on the abuse crisis than was done by Pope Benedict. For example, last year Bergoglio was outspoken regarding the case of accused (Argentine) priest Justo José Ilarraz," McKiernan said.
But while "Pope Francis' meetings with survivors of sexual abuse will be less formal than Pope Benedict's pioneering encounters," McKiernan said Francis "encountered many cases of sexual abuse in the years when he was an auxiliary bishop and then the archbishop of Buenos Aires. Yet he has been content for the most part to remain silent."
Francis, whose papacy is effective immediately, will be formally installed at 4:30 a.m. EDT (9:30 a.m. CET) Tuesday, the feast of St. Joseph.
Before that, the pope will privately visit Saint Mary Major basilica to pray on Thursday in one of his first acts as pontiff. He will then have an audience with cardinals at 6 a.m. EDT (11 a.m. CET) Friday, as well as an audience with journalists at the same time on Saturday.
Papal installation typically begins with a visit with cardinals to the grottos of St. Peter's Basilica, where the first pope, St. Peter, is said to be buried. There, the new pope is expected to say, "I leave from where the apostle arrived," before a procession to the square and the installation Mass (the Mass lasted two hours for Benedict's installation in 2005).
At the installation Mass, Francis is expected to receive the Fisherman's Ring made for his papacy (the one Benedict wore was given up when he retired and purposely damaged by Vatican authorities per tradition) as well as the pallium, the woolen stole that's a symbol of his authority.
When Benedict was elected, 12 church representatives knelt in front of him at the installation: three cardinals, one bishop, a priest, a deacon, a married couple, a nun and man from a religious order, and two young people who have had their confirmations -- a key sacrament of the faith. A similar group could possibly kneel in front of Francis as a symbolic pledge of obedience.
After the Mass, the new pope customarily is driven around St. Peter's Square to greet groups of priests and laypeople from around the world. In the following days, he is expected to visit St. Paul Outside the Walls. and St. John Lateran basilicas. The first visit is usually to St. Paul Outside the Walls.
During his first few weeks as pope, Francis will live in a temporary apartment away from the official papal residence. Vatican spokesman Lombardi previously showed reporters a video of the new pope's short-term home, which has a study, a sitting area and a carving of Jesus Christ's face on the headboard of the bed. Francis will stay there while the official papal apartment is renovated. The apartment was sealed after Benedict's resignation and church rules say it can't be reopened for any reason until there is a new pope.

YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN) - A Youngstown firefighter was shot Monday night after responding to a fire, and police believe it was a targeted shooting.
It began when the Youngstown Fire Department's Engine #7 was called about 9 p.m. to a house fire at Halleck and Elm streets.
The crew had just left the fire scene on Elm around 11:15 p.m. and turned onto Halleck, when firefighters saw a man standing in a driveway and then heard gunshots. Rounds passed through both doors of the truck on the left side.
"One hit the driver in the leg. The second went through the back door and actually went through the firefighter's coat, right in front of his chest," Fire Chief John O'Neill said.
A perimeter was set up and K-9 units were called in to search the area.
Lutton is still recovering Tuesday night and the other firefighter, Dwyain Montgomery, wasn't hurt, although the bullet was found in a pocket of his turnout coat.
"The firefighter shot in the leg is - I saw him early again this morning - seems to be doing quite well under the circumstances. A lot of pain, obviously. Hopefully he might get released today if all goes well," O'Neill said.
At the time of the fire, police were sent to the scene after firefighters complained that a man had been yelling at them and driving back and forth through the area. Officers heard the gunshots around the corner, but the suspect was gone by the time they got there.
O'Neill says he doesn't think the shooting was random, and that police are treating it as a targeted shooting.
"I don't think they were stray bullets. There were a few shots taken and we have at least two bullet holes in the truck," O'Neill said. "Now it's going to be up to the police. Hopefully, the police will get on this and get someone right away, and find out what's going on and why they did it."
The fire truck is back in service Tuesday.
O'Neill says the shooting has rattled other firefighters in the department.
Until further notice, a Youngstown police squad will accompany firefighters to any fire scene. With police close by, fire crews were back on Elm Street Tuesday, dowsing hot spots from the vacant house fire.
"They're going to make frequent stops at the stations," O'Neill said. "Any calls that we have, they're going to have cruisers that are in the area go and respond to that location also, and that's whether it's a small fire or a structure fire."
While they were fighting the fire, crews had to call city police to the scene, complaining that a man kept walking and driving through the area. O'Neill says the man actually exchanged words with some of the firefighters, and the shooting happened an hour or so later.
Police are looking for him, while arson investigators try to determine who set the house on fire.
"We're out looking for the individual, we have some leads. Detectives are out talking to some people now," Police Capt. Brad Blackburn said.
Firefighters gave a description of the man they said was harassing them at the fire scene, as well as the license number of his car.
"We can't confirm yet that the confrontation with the gentleman earlier at the scene was the same gentleman that shot at them," Blackburn said.
So far, no one has been arrested.
Those with information on the shooting are asked to call Youngstown Police at 330-742-8950.
SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonia's lawmakers on Wednesday evening endorsed a new government led by Social Democrats which is expected to steer the way out of a two-year-long political crisis and bring the country closer to membership in the European Union and NATO.

Nearly six months after parliamentary elections on Dec. 11, 62 out of 120 deputies voted in favor of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government. Forty-four lawmakers voted against and five abstained.
“I can state that the new government has been elected,” the parliament speaker, Talat Xhaferi, said after the vote.
Zaev vowed to step up economic reforms and pledged to speed up the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO, but opposition parties said his goals would be difficult to achieve.
During the debate leading up to Wednesday's vote, which began on Tuesday, a deputy of the nationalist VMRO-DPMNE, Dimitar Stevanandzija, said Zaev made “promises that are unreal and absurd.”
The government will be hoping to lead Macedonia out of its worst political crisis since 2001, when Western diplomacy brought it back from the brink of civil war during an ethnic Albanian insurgency
Macedonia has been without a functional government since 2015, after a wiretapping scandal brought down the previous administration. Zaev's Social Democrats have formed a coalition with parties representing the country's ethnic Albanians.
Efforts to advance toward membership of the EU and NATO have stalled due to a row with Greece over Macedonia's name, which it shares with a northern Greek province.
Of the 25 ministers in Zaev's government, seven are ethnic Albanians, who make up one-third of the country's population.
Macedonia has domestic ethnicity issues to tackle. As part of the coalition deal, an ethnic Albanian was elected last month to be parliament speaker. That prompted protests by nationalists who stormed the parliament building and beat some deputies including Zaev.
Recently, long-time developer Tale of Tales revealed that they were no longer pursuing commercial video game production. Although they ran a successful Kickstarter for Sunset, it failed to attract much attention from the gaming populace after launch. This huge misstep caused the development team to reevaluate their work and decide that they were not going to make games for the “mainstream” any longer.
With that said, they never said they were done utilizing Kickstarter or other funding avenues. They've been running Patreon pages for a bit now but it looks like an upcoming project is going to require a fair bit more funding. In their latest backer update Tale of Tales revealed they are planning a Kickstarter for a “new, surprising project!”
As a fan of their work, I'm definitely excited by what may be coming. They have not specified anything about said project, though, so it may not even be a video game. After all, they've created non-game art before and continue to. We should expect to see their campaign go live sometime in October.
Do you think this campaign will be for another video game or something else entirely?
President Moon Jae-in presides over a senior secretariat meeting in the Blue House on Thursday. It was the first meeting of its kind since President Moon was sworn in on May 10. [YONHAP]
President Moon Jae-in has decided he will not use the Blue House budget to pay for his private expenses, including groceries for his wife and himself and even food for his pets.“From now on, meals that are not parts of official meetings will be paid from the president's own money,” said Lee Joung-do, general affairs secretary of the Blue House. “We will stop using the state budget to pay for meals and personal purchases of the presidential family. It is the president's strong will to clearly distinguish what should be paid with tax money and what should not.”Until now, money from the special expense account of the Blue House was used to pay the living expense of the president and his family. Lee said Moon's decision will save a considerable amount.Special expenses accounts exist for almost all government ministries for activities that require confidentiality. Because no receipts are required, the accounts are often used for non-official purposes.Although the Blue House did not make a comparison, the move appeared to be the latest in a series of actions taken by Moon to differentiate himself from predecessor Park Geun-hye.A minor part of the presidential abuse of power and corruption scandal that led to Park's impeachment and removal involved a personal health trainer she hired as a presidential secretary. Park used the special expenses account to pay for her clothes and beauty treatments. She saved most of her annual salary of 210 million won ($187,835).According to Lee, 16.2 billion won was allocated to the special expense account of the Blue House this year. As of now, 12.7 billion won remains, and Moon wants to save 5.3 billion won to use for job creation for the young and programs for needy people.Lee said the secretariat will create stricter standards for the special expense account and ask for a smaller amount starting next year. “We will request a 5 billion won cut in next year's budget,” Lee said.Moon made clear his intention at a senior secretariat meeting. “It is appropriate that I pay for the things that can be clearly identified as personal, such as food for me and my wife and pet food for my dogs and cat,” Moon was quoted as saying by his spokesman, Park Soo-hyun.The senior secretariat meeting was also held in a more casual manner, a departure from Park's stiff way of hosting meetings with secretaries and ministers. A round table was used, and Moon poured his own coffee before the discussion began. Most of the participants were tie-less.Moon asked his aides to freely express their opinions and not hesitate to challenge his orders. “Unless we have a debate without reservations here, we will never have a chance,” Moon said. “The senior secretariat meeting is the first opportunity to right a wrong direction. When everyone remains silent, a wrong order will be made. Challenging the president's order is not an option, but a duty.”Moon also said he won't mind if his secretaries fail to reach a consensus and disagreements were later reported. He asked all aides to speak freely and candidly without presumption that the president has better information than them. He also ordered the secretaries never to write down what he says during the meeting. “You just have to concentrate on discussion,” Moon said, adding that he will operate the cabinet meetings in the same way.At meetings during the Park administration, she read a lengthy opening statement, often containing orders, and ministers and presidential secretaries wrote them down.BY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]
"We have this woman who in many ways is just the complete opposite of Andrew Jackson, and it speaks volumes that we can recognize [Tubman] as this great American hero and image of what it means to be American."
Catherine Clinton, who wrote "Harriet Tubman: The Road to Freedom," said she was invited by the Smithsonian to a discussion about putting a woman on the $10 bill and gave a copy of her book to Lew and U.S. Treasurer Rosie Rios.
"I felt that people needed to know how amazing her story was," she said. "She just wasn't a figure from the Underground Railroad, she just wasn't a self-emancipated slave, but she was a brave warrior in the fight against slavery. Harriet Tubman, I found, was such an important figure to so many because she represented the concept of one person making a difference."
The last time a woman was on a paper note was in the late 1800s, when First Lady Martha Washington appeared on the $1 silver certificate. Pocahontas was on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869.
Lew's original plan to change the $10 — to have Hamilton share the bill with a woman, or release two different bills — met backlash from several directions.
Many said the only woman on the nation's paper currency should be featured alone on the bill, rather than sharing space with a man.
Arrow S2x15 “The Promise” Share:
There are major spoilers for both this episode and all previous Arrow episodes!
If you'll remember from Season 1 there was a flashback-heavy episode entitled The Odyssey that used Moira Queen's shooting of Arrow to put Oliver in an unconscious state following his rescue by Felicity – allowing for the good portion of the episode to tell the story of Slade Wilson and Oliver Queen's attempted escape from the island, as strangers rather than brothers. At the time it was the second episode to feature Slade Wilson, and the two characters attempted to escape the island as virtual strangers rather than, as Slade calls them now, “brothers.” There's a heavy layer of friendship between Slade and Ollie when they head to destroy the Professor Ivo's ship, and with Sara in tow, they have a better chance than ever to escape. However, Professor Ivo is a manipulator – and if he tells Slade, who is unstable following the injection of the Mirakuru, that it was Ollie who was responsible for killing Shado, then nobody is quite sure what he will do.
In the present day however, Slade Wilson demonstrates an incredibly bold move in the previous episode and that's to go right into Ollie's house and hold a conversation with his mother knowing full well what Ollie can do. However, in order to keep his mother in the dark, they don't initiate a full fight there and then – and it's clear that Slade has something else in mind when he whispers “Not yet, kid,” to Oliver. Manu Bennett is easily one of the best, if not the best actor on Arrow and he really demonstrated why he's so good just here (even more so on the flashback sequences) with a great performance as Deathstroke to establish that clearly he's so much more of a threat than Malcolm Merlyn is and I really hope he sticks around to become a major long term villain rather than just being dealt with at the end of the series. A standout scene in the present was the scene where Team Arrow (with Roy, for once) – were all rushing to the aid of Oliver to defeat Slade after he contacts Felicity, and it was great to see the team working together and this is probably the sort of thing that we're going to expect in the future episodes. It was also a nice nod to see Roy meet with Slade on the front entrance to the Queen family household – any fan of him in the comics will know that Roy has a shared history with Deathstroke so it'll be interesting to see how they tackle it in future episodes.
The Promise has, much like The Odyssey, joined the rank of my Top 5 favourite episodes (Sacrifice, The Odyssey, The Promise, League of Assassins & Three Ghosts) mainly due to its flashback material. But unlike The Odyssey, the present day sequences are just as gripping – in The Odyssey, we knew that Ollie would make it out alive, because well – he was the main star in his show. Here in The Promise, the present day scenes have a lot of suspense going for them – there's a lot more tension, and the payoff is great. Although If I have one problem with the episode it's that the hidden cameras in the Queen Household don't really look that well hidden, or that small, and it would be fairly obvious to anybody who bothered to take a closer look.
There are still questions left to be asked and it's going to be a great ride to see how the show deals with them. We still have more flashback sequences to pan out, and it'll be very interesting to see how they happen with the new status quo. There's also Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey cropping up in the next two episodes – with a teased Harley Quinn appearance (which would be so awesome) and things look very good for the future indeed. Whilst Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D is struggling to get to grips with how many elements from the comics it should bring in, Arrow is blazing ahead in that department and it's only a matter of time before it is connected to the wider DC Universe.
One thing's for sure though, if The Promise is anything to go by, then the ride is going to be great. This show is just that good.
It is very racist but beyond that it shows how pitiful public schools are.
What I get from this is (this is how I read the article not necessarily what I believe)
Black kids aren't bright enough or able to learn as well as white or latino kids so they need their own spelling bee
or
Public schools are just another entitlement, you get credit for doing nothing basically.
or
they just want some dumbdonkey (like me) to say something bad about it, much like the bleeding hearts of ats, so I can fill the much-needed racist spot and they can feel fulfilled in their daily lives by exposing the white racist monster.
It's not just the black spelling bee but all things that one race thinks it has to have to feel up to par with other races or even to stroke its own lil ego.
If I were a truely proud black man I would tell em to stick their entitlements up their butts because I know how to earn what I have and I don't need some govt handing things to me and keeping me in slavery to them.
But overall this is my opinion and it doesn't mean anything in the long run
Story highlights Michael Jackson's mom and kids accuse AEG Live of pressuring Dr. Conrad Murray
A "smoking gun" e-mail ties AEG Live to Murray, Jackson attorney says
Concert promoter AEG Live argues it did not hire or supervise Murray
Murray is serving a prison sentence for Jackson's 2009 death
A "smoking gun" e-mail allegedly connecting a concert promoter to Michael Jackson's death was revealed this week as a judge unsealed documents in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and children.
The trial next month in Los Angeles could shed new light on the pop icon's last days as Dr. Conrad Murray, who did not testify at his own involuntary manslaughter trial, and Jackson's oldest son Prince , 16, are on the witness list.
Jackson died two weeks before his "This Is It" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London in the summer of 2009. E-mails suggested that the promoter was worried about Jackson's missed rehearsals and they sought Murray's help in getting him ready.
Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson and their grandmother, Katherine Jackson , contend that AEG Live's pressure on Murray to have Michael Jackson ready for daily rehearsals despite his fragile health led to his death from an overdose of surgical anesthetic.
The judge ruled Wednesday that Jackson lawyers have shown enough evidence that AEG Live hired and supervised Murray to warrant a jury trial. She also ruled there was evidence to support the Jacksons' claim that AEG Live executives could have foreseen that Murray would use dangerous drugs in treating the pop icon.

"Now that the court has ruled that there is evidence that it was foreseeable that AEG's actions resulted in Michael Jackson's death, the Jackson family feels vindicated from the public smear campaign that AEG has waged against them," Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle said Sunday. "The truth about what happened to Michael, which AEG has tried to keep hidden from the public since the day Michael died, is finally emerging. We look forward to the trial where the rest of the story will come to light."
A cornerstone of the Jacksons' case is an e-mail AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson's June 25, 2009, death . The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: "We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."
Jackson lawyers, calling it a "smoking gun," argue the e-mail is evidence that AEG Live used Murray's fear of losing his $150,000-a-month job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health.
Ortega, who had worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, sounded a loud warning about his health after Jackson showed up for a rehearsal shivering just over a week before his death. He wrote in an e-mail to AEG Live President Randy Phillips: "It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state. I believe we need professional guidance in this matter."
Phillips responded with a glowing endorsement of Murray: "This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig so he is totally unbiased and ethical."
Jackson lawyers point to another e-mail exchange as evidence that Phillips was directly involved with pressuring Murray to have Jackson at rehearsals. The e-mail was sent by AEG Live tour accountant Timm Woolley to an insurance broker two days before Jackson died: "Randy Phillips and Dr. Murray are responsible for MJ rehearsal and attendance schedule."
Murray told investigators two days after Jackson's death that he used the surgical anesthetic propofol every night for two months to help him rest for rehearsals. It was a procedure Jackson demanded, he said. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson had died from an overdose of propofol in combination with sedatives. Murray is serving a prison sentence for his involuntary manslaughter conviction.
AEG Live argues it has no liability in Jackson's death because Murray was not its employee. AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam did not respond Sunday to CNN calls for comment, but he did give a short statement last year: "Defendants did not hire Dr. Murray nor were they responsible for the death of Michael Jackson."
The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009. If AEG Live is found liable, it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson's income potential. AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that is now for sale with an $8 billion asking price.
Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos, in her ruling rejecting AEG Live's request to have the case thrown out, said she agreed that the Jackson lawyers provided evidence that AEG Live didn't do "a sufficient background check of Dr. Murray, which would have established that Murray was deeply in debt."
Jackson's previous relationship with Murray, who treated him and his children for minor illnesses in Las Vegas, did not relieve AEG Live of liability, "although the fact may be relevant in determining proportional liability and damages," she said.
While the AEG Live lawyers argued the company could not have foreseen that Murray might use dangerous drugs on Jackson in preparation for the tour, Palazuelos said there was evidence that Gongaware had "previous tour experiences" with Jackson in which "tour doctors" gave "large amounts of drugs/controlled substances to him." Gongaware testified in Murray's trial that he worked as tour manager for Jackson's "Dangerous" and "History" tours before joining AEG Live.
The judge cited "Gongaware's general knowledge of the ethical issues surrounding 'tour doctors' and the practice of administering drugs to performing artists."
"There is a triable issue of fact as to whether it was foreseeable that such a physician under strong financial pressure may compromise his Hippocratic Oath and do what was known by AEG Live's executives to be an unfortunate practice in the entertainment industry for financial gain," the judge wrote.
A deleted scene from an early screenplay for The Shining, dated February 4, 1978. In this scene, Jack finds a scrapbook which chronicles the Overlook Hotel's sordid history. Jack becomes obsessed with the scrapbook, then shares his discovery with Wendy.
The scrapbook, which figures prominently in Stephen King's novel, was all but removed in the final cut of the film. However, many scenes involving the scrapbook were filmed but not used, including this scene from a later draft.
(Many thanks to David Winter for sharing this screenplay. His grandfather, Derek Winter, was a manager at Stansted Airport, which was used as the location for Dick Hallorann's phone call to Larry Durkin. The screenplay was given to him by Kubrick so he could read the story and approve the use of the airport as a location.)
“Just as Ikea looks for innovative ways to create a better everyday home life for many people, the Ikea Foundation is looking for ways to create a better everyday life for poor families who have lost their homes," said Ikea Foundation CEO Per Heggenes in a statement.
"By bringing together our partners and funding new technology, we can help make a tremendous difference to the world's most vulnerable children,” he added.
The Ikea refugee shelters have been designed by a group of Swedish designers within the Refugee Housing Unit and are equipped with insulation and solar panels which provide enough electricity for lighting.
"Our goal is to revolutionize the refugee tent, or at least improve it," said Johan Karlsson of the Refugee Housing Unit in a film on the Ikea Foundation website.
"Like an Ikea bookshelf, it is easy to transport and easy to set up in the field."

Much of the temporary housing in refugee centres often has a life span of as little as six months and the typical white canvas style tent design has shown incapable of meeting the needs of refugees.
"Quite frankly the tents have not much evolved over the years - they still rely on canvas, ropes and poles. They are hot during the summer and cold in winter," said Pierre Olivier Delarue of the UNHCR in the film.
"On average a family will spend 12 years in a camp, so many children will grow up calling this shelter home," he added.
The refugee shelter project, into which the Ikea Foundation has poured some $4.5 million, remains at the prototype stage and the first batch of shelters are set to be tested by the UNHCR in a camp in Ethiopia.
The test families will be able to provide feedback on the shelters as part of the UNHCR evaluation of the project.

The Department of Homeland Security is headed for a shutdown tomorrow night unless Congress acts to fund it. Republicans in the Senate and the House can't seem to get on the same page as to the right strategy to solve the problem. It's deja vu all over again for a Republican congressional leadership that has watched as its attempt to avoid a series of politically painful showdowns thwarted by the most conservative element of its congressional party.
And yet, despite all of that, Speaker John Boehner seems to be having a very good time. Witness this moment of Boehnerian brilliance when asked whether he had decided what the House would do if the Senate passes a DHS funding bill without provisions to repeal the executive actions taken by President Obama on immigration.
“When I make decisions, I'll let you know,” Boehner said. “That's just a kiss, that's all.”
Yes, yes it is.

I have an old 20GB iPod and even though I have a lot of music on there, I am only taking up half of the space available. So there's another 10GB kicking around doing nothing and so I decided to start putting some useful iPod tools 50 Free Tools to Make Your iPod Better and ... 50 Free Tools to Make Your iPod Better and ... Read More on there for when I'm on the move. Some of that space was allocated for installing one of my favourite websites – Wikipedia.
Yes that's right. Thanks to iPodLinux, you can now have the entire Wikipedia encylopedia on your iPod. Clocking in at only 1.7 GB of space, it is a very handy tool if you have the sudden uncontrollable urge while out at the shops to discover the capital of Mongolia or the mating habits of eels. The Wikipedia file is updated approximately once every 6 months so you won't have the most up-to-date version but hey it's free and Mongolia isn't going to change their capital anytime soon.
[Update: Please note, this doesn't seem to work on all iPod models. For more details check comments section.]
It's very easy to set this up but the actual Wikipedia file is so huge that it takes a long time to download. I have been waiting for 35 minutes and the download is only at 40%. So be prepared to wait a while for the file to be finished.
1. First connect your iPod to your computer and fire up iTunes. Then make sure the box “enabling disk use” is ticked. This is extremely important otherwise you won't be able to move any files on there. Then close down iTunes. 2. Download the program installation wizard and install. Make sure your iPod is still plugged into your computer as the program installation wizard will automatically detect your iPod presence and install everything directly there. 3. One important thing to remember during installation is that you will be asked if you want to make the Wikipedia your “default system” on your iPod. This means that when you switch on your iPod each time, do you want to see your music menu or the Wikipedia menu? I recommend you say no to making Wikipedia the default view. 4. When the installation is complete, eject your iPod from your computer. 5. Now is the time to see if the installation worked. You need to reboot your iPod which you achieve by holding down the play button and the menu button together at the same time for 5 seconds. You will then see the Apple logo which is the iPod re-booting. When you see the Apple logo, press down the re-wind button for 5 seconds and this kicks in the new Wikipedia section of your iPod. 6. If everything looks OK, you now need to download the huge 1.7 GB Wikipedia file. When it is downloaded, go to your iPod folder on your PC, specifically to “dataencyclopodialibrary” and place the file in there. 7. Again, eject and re-boot the iPod, use the rewind button to go to your Wikipedia section and see if the Wikipedia file works properly.
To make a search, just use the scroll wheel to choose letters to spell your search term (just like you would choose the keys on a mobile phone to type a SMS message). Then press the “play” button to start searching.
A few extra pointers:
*When accessing the Wikipedia file on your iPod, you have to go into “settings” first and alter the screen contrast and the wheel sensitivity. It will be totally off-whack the first time you access it. *The older your iPod, the slower it will be to retrieve information from the Wikipedia file. Your iPod might even crash, prompting you to re-boot. So this works best with the newer iPod models. *Every 6 months or so, download the Wikipedia file again so you get the latest version. However, saying that, the current file is dated February 2007 so maybe once a year is more accurate! *When you are in the Wikipedia section, pressing the menu button turns the backlight on. The backlight will stay on until you switch it off again so you can read the text easily. Be aware though that having the light continually on is a real battery drainer. *To get back to your music section, you need to reboot the iPod again by holding down the menu button and the play button.
The close 52-46 vote was nearly along party lines aside from aisle-switching by Susan Collins (R-ME) to oppose and Joe Manchin III (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), both from coal-rich states, to support. Democrats fought all night to delay the confirmation vote until next Tuesday, after which the Oklahoma attorney general's office is ordered to release 3,000 of Pruitt's emails concerning his communications with the fossil fuel industry, according to The New York Times.
Since early December when Trump announced Pruitt as his pick to head the agency, reporters and environmentalists were quick to point out his numerous lawsuits against the EPA in his position as attorney general of Oklahoma. This singular drive to challenge national environmental law aimed to return all regulatory power to states -- convenient for an AG with such close ties to the fossil fuel industry, as when he reprinted a note from an oil and gas company nearly word-for-word on his letterhead and sent it to the EPA in 2011. Who knows how much of the department will be left now that its frequent enemy is heading it.
On the eighth anniversary of Hillary Clinton's suspension speech, voters in New Jersey and five western states, including the behemoth, California, will go to the polls. Given her weekend territorial victories, Hillary is certain to clinch in New Jersey before the western polls close.
Some points to remember:
Every victory above and beyond NJ ensures more delegates for Hillary. So if you are in MT, ND, SD, NM, and CA please vote even if you have heard that she has clinched and even if there are lines. What we learned last night is that the lines in Puerto Rico were due to the Sanders campaign asking to have polling places closed due to a lack of volunteers to monitor the original number of polling locations. Voters were reassigned to new polling locations causing overloads. If this happens where you are, please stay the course and cast your vote. Some are saying that undeclared special delegates (Super Ds) may rush to declare perhaps today. John King at CNN has said that it is unlikely that they will do that before Tuesday so that the voters can bring Hillary over the hump rather than the Super Ds. It is also important to remember that the target total of delegates, 2383, includes Super Ds. So when the Sanders campaign posits that she has not reached that number in pledged delegates, it is not pledged delegates alone that comprise that target. All ballots are not created equal. Access your sample ballot, if it has not been sent to you, via your local board of elections and study it before you go.
Here is a scan of the NJ ballot in my district. Notice that it is not necessary for Democratic voters to vote separately for the delegates (as it is for Republican voters). Be sure that if you must vote separately for the delegates, you do so. Finally, make sure to vote all the way across for the down-ticket candidates on your ballot.
Let's all do a bang-up job for Hillary tomorrow and bring home a huge delegate count for Hillary. The more delegates she has, the stronger she is for all of us.
Here are a few things you can do even as late as today to help out: donate, volunteer to canvass and to make calls.
Any discussion of reclaiming freedom in America is pointless without an accurate understanding of how our rights were lost in the first place. The Real Lincoln, Professor Thomas DiLorenzo's controversial book on the subject, makes a compelling case that it was Abraham Lincoln himself who set us on our present course.
From the book's foreword by Walter E. Williams:
The War between the States settled by force whether states could secede. Once it was established that states cannot secede, the federal government, abetted by a Supreme Court unwilling to hold it to its constitutional restraints, was able to run amok over states' rights, so much so that the protections of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments mean little or nothing today.
Since its publication in 2002, there have been many supposed rebuttals of The Real Lincoln, but none that credibly addresses damning historical evidence of the war's origins, President Lincoln's motives, or his documented usurpation of constitutional liberty.
Contrary to assertions by Lincoln apologists and the man himself, no serious person could believe that the founders, having just won a war of secession over England prior to writing our Constitution, ever intended the Union to nullify the sovereignty of the states or constitutional liberties to be suspended at the whim of the first chief executive who found them politically inexpedient.
But as DiLorenzo and history make clear, Lincoln did not fight the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century, against his own people and at a cost of 620,000 American lives, to free the slaves. He fought it to set a precedent of federal supremacy over the states. And in the process turned his apparent belief that the ends justify the means into federal dogma.
The Real Lincoln offers perhaps the most lucid diagnosis to date of the disease of centralization that is currently devouring the soul of this country. The principles of the Tenth Amendment and federalism are its only cure.
L.A. City Attorney Mike Feuer has filed complaints against the owners of four rent-stabilized apartment buildings who are accused of operating them as hotels, or listing units on Airbnb and similar sites.
This is the first time that the City of Los Angeles has taken this kind of action, the L.A. Times reports. However, the idea that landlords are snatching affordable homes to cash in on the sharing economy has been a controversial one for quite some time in Los Angeles, a city with skyrocketing rent.
The details of the four properties are outlined in a release from the City Attorney's office. The owners of a 32-unit building at 417 Ocean Front Walks in Venice are accused of advertising the property as a hotel, complete with its own website. The same accusations have been leveled at the owners of a 30-unit building at 1305 Ocean Front Walks, which has also allegedly been advertised as a hotel.
In Hollywood, a 59-unit building at 830 N. Van Ness Avenue is accused of calling itself as Hollywood Dream Suites Hotel. You might be familiar with this one, as this pink building actually looks like a quirky, old hotel. Its owner, George Panoussis, is accused of refusing to allow inspectors access to the property eight times.
On Yelp, it has one-and-a-half stars and one recent guest wrote:
I think the room would have made an awesome studio apt. It felt very homey more like we were in Someone's room at their house rather than a Hotel which isn't a bad thing. Just different.
All three were ordered to stop acting as a hotel by Los Angeles Housing & Community Investment Department (HCIDLA) and allegedly failed to comply, according to the release.
Carol J. Alsman, who owns a four-unit apartment building at 500 North Genesee Ave. in Fairfax has been charged with six counts including failure to comply with an Order to Comply, zoning violations, illegal use without proper building permits, failure to file notice of intention to re-rent, failure to offer rental to displaced tenants, and renting property within five years after withdrawing from the rental market under the Ellis Act.
Carrie Kirshman and Nina Giovannetti, two tenants who once lived in the apartment, said that they had each paid less than $2,000 per month for their two-bedroom apartments. Kishman had lived there for 21 years. However, they were both evicted in 2013 under the Ellis Act, only to later find the units on Airbnb.
The Ellis Act, signed into law in 1986, allows landlords to evict all of their rent-controlled tenants if they intend to convert their building to another use, such as a condo or hotel, or seek to tear the whole thing down and build new apartments.
However, the law also demands that landlords pay for evicted tenants to move somewhere else, and must tell those tenants if they plan on renting the units out again any time within the next five years. The complaint filed by Feuer's office alleges that the units were going for over $550 a night on the home sharing site, according to the Times.
The City Attorney's office plans to send a list of Ellis Act properties to Airbnb and similar sites in order to prevent any other sites being similarly listed.
In recent years, several compounds of the phenethylamine-type (2C-series) have entered the illicit drug market as designer drugs. In former studies, the qualitative metabolism of frequently abused 2Cs (2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7) was studied using a rat model. Major phase I metabolic steps were deamination and O-demethylation. Deamination to the corresponding aldehyde was the reaction, which was observed for all studied compounds. Such reactions could in principal be catalyzed by two enzyme systems: monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cytochrome P450 (CYP). The aim of this study was to determine the human MAO and CYP isoenzymes involved in this major metabolic step and to measure the Michaelis–Menten kinetics of the deamination reactions. For these studies, cDNA-expressed CYPs and MAOs were used. The formation of the aldehyde metabolite was measured using GC–MS after extraction. For all compounds studied, MAO-A and MAO-B were the major enzymes involved in the deamination. For 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7, CYP2D6 was also involved, but only to a very small extent. Because of the isoenzymes involved, the 2Cs are likely to be susceptible for drug–drug interactions with MAO inhibitors.
Day 53, Feast Day #28,
I was going to finish up a post about something else, but I ended up making a yummy dinner and realized it ended up being low-calorie too. That means I get leftovers for tomorrow's fast day, yay! There is no actual Parmesan cheese in this recipe, so it is almost eggplant parmesan Goat cheese is 80 calories per ounce versus 122 per ounce of actual Parmesan cheese, plus I just like the taste and texture better.
Almost Eggplant Parmesan (Yields 5-6 servings of two slices) ~261 kcal/serving
Takes 45-55 minutes
1 tbsp of olive oil ~120 kcal
1 eggplant, sliced into 1/4-1/2 inch slices with the peel on ~110 kcal
kosher salt
1 cup pasta/tomato sauce ~140 kcal
4 oz soft goat cheese, crumbled ~320 kcal
1 tsp Italian seasoning (or mix of marjoram, thyme, oregano, and basil)
2 large eggs, beaten ~140 kcal
1/2 of a lemon's juice - optional ~6 kcal
95g buttery crackers (about 32 crackers), crushed into crumbs ~455 kcal
1 tsp garlic powder ~9 kcal
1/2 tsp onion powder ~4 kcal
1/4 tsp black pepper ~1 kcal
Set the oven to bake at 375 degrees.
The next thing I do is prep the eggplant, because it is best to get some of the water out of them to avoid sogginess later. I laid out a baking sheet and put down a layer of paper towels. I then lightly salt both sides of the eggplant slices with the kosher salt and lay them on the paper towels. I put another layer of paper towels on top and them put some heavy plates on them to squeeze out some of the water.
Meanwhile, prep everything else. Crush and mix the cracker crumbs in a large bowl (which you can substitute with any other breading agent like breadcrumbs or almond meal) with the garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.
Beat the eggs with the lemon juice in a shallow bowl (so you can easily dip the eggplant slices into it).
Pat dry the eggplant slices and set aside. Then lightly coat the baking sheet with the olive oil.
Dip a eggplant slice into the egg mixture so it is coated. Then put the egg-covered slice into the crumb mixture and coat evenly. Place the slice on the baking sheet. Repeat with all the slices.
Bake the slices for 15 minutes. Then remove the baking sheet and flip them over.
Top the slices with the pasta sauce and goat cheese. Put the eggplant back into the oven and bake an additional 15-20 minutes. Eat!
I ate mine with some sauteed rainbow Swiss chard, onion, and garlic with a little soy sauce, pepper, salt, and maple syrup (

Ferrari Special Projects is developing a one-off model commissioned by Cheerag Arya from Dubai and based on the 599 GTO.
Cheerag Arya is the head of a petrochemical company and a collector of Ferraris, owning an F40, an F430 Scuderia, an Enzo, a Daytona, a 599 GTO, a 599XX and an SA Aperta.
He recently approached the Special Projects division and commissioned a one-off sportscar based on the 599 GTO.
As Ferrari Magazine reported, designers presented him with many different concept sketches. Arya selected design elements from the various proposals and asked to incorporate them in the final design.
The SP Arya is currently in the final stages of development, and a clay model has been approved.
The delivery is expected for early 2013. The car is expected to be used by its owner both in Dubai and Europe, but there will be no official presentation.
The SP Arya is the fifth project by the Special Projects division, following the 2008 SP1, the 2009 the P540 Superfast Aperta, the 2011 Superamerica 45 and the recent SP12 EC commissioned by Eric Clapton.

YEREVAN. – The European Union invested around 50 million euros into Armenia's judiciary, head of EU delegation Piotr Switalski said.
Switalski said EU is ready to continue cooperation with Armenia and has already contributed to the electoral process, and “we believe that it was the right investment.” Dialogue with Armenia on human rights is one of the most constructive among the Eastern Partnership countries, he assured.
The EU ambassador added that changes take time, and he is sometimes critical, but he is happy to see that many Armenians perceive his criticism as a friendly voice from outside.
“We do not want to force anything. We just want Armenia to follow certain well-tested European patterns. You know how difficult it is to change the mentality of someone, so we perceive it as a process,” the head of the EU delegation added.
Tom Rockliff says the constant pressure affected him off the field
BRISBANE Lions midfielder Tom Rockliff fell out of love with football in 2016.
After a horror year of unwanted headlines for the skipper of an AFL club, the 26-year-old enters the final year of his contract with a fresh outlook.
He intends to approach the game with the same sense of wonder he once had as a kid in the Victorian country town of Benalla.
"If you can walk into your job and you love your job you can perform better," Rockliff told AFL.com.au.
"For me it's about finding that and probably recreating [the same feeling as when] you're a six-year-old and what that felt like to be playing footy."
The reasons he stopped enjoying football are obvious to anyone with a passing interest in Rockliff.
His team was being thrashed, his coach was under the pump and his reputation took a hammering.
Rockliff became well aware of how he was being perceived.
"I understand that I polarise people. People either love me or hate me. There is no in between and that is just who I am," Rockliff said.
Most of his public protestations to criticism fell flat and there weren't too many going into bat for him when fierce bouncers came his way.
His post-season tweet denigrating a female seemed to be the final straw for a club that had endured many questions about his commitment and trade talk reached fever pitch.
Rockliff has contributed strongly to team discussions during the pre-season. Picture: AFL Photos
Eventually however, after a frank meeting with incoming coach Chris Fagan and football manager David Noble, and little interest from other clubs, the decision was made for him to stay.
Now, as he sits down to chat as another pre-season with the Lions gets up and running, he understands the ball is in his court to re-establish his standing.
"It's all chips in. It's not half-in, half-out," Rockliff said.
"The best thing for the football club was that we sat down and had a conversation and I think growing out of that we have gained a lot of respect for each other."
All parties involved in that conversation only have positive things to say about his actions in the time that has elapsed since that meeting wiped the slate clean.
He has been training hard and contributing strongly in team discussions.
While 'Rocky' carries a body that's more Bullwinkle than Balboa because of his skinny legs, he's fit and his effort on the track is strong.
'Rocky' is keen to let his actions do the talking in season 2017. Picture: AFL Photos
Rockliff understands, if he didn't before, that only actions will count when future determinations are made about him.
"I think the talking and that side of it is done," Rockliff said.
His ability to find the football has never been in question, until midway through last season when the team started to struggle.
"On reflection I got disheartened very quickly in games. I could feel the game was slipping away and there was nothing I could do to change that," Rockliff said.
"There was a period of six or seven weeks in the season where I let myself down in that area."
He admits the pressure of leading a team on the receiving end of constant thrashings affected him.
"I felt the pressure probably got to me at times and I felt like I could not switch off when I got home," Rockliff said.
"I was a different person. I changed into someone who was on edge all the time, someone that was angry all the time."
He then made what can be a fatal mistake for any leader under pressure and withdrew into self-protection mode.
"There is no doubt I definitely did," Rockliff said.
"[That is] not a healthy thing for a footballer and especially a leader of a football club.
"When the defeats come you start to go in self-survival mode and everyone starts to point the finger and look elsewhere when you probably should look inside yourself. That is probably the starting point."
In some ways you can't blame him for indulging in self-protection.
Coached by two Lions legends during his time, he had been asked to lead a club in a period of instability that is never conducive to good performance.
Fagan and Noble's arrival might become a circuit breaker for him.
That experienced pair understand that great clubmen don't blame others for their circumstances nor do they line up critics.
They just get on with the job, always looking at what needs to be done next.
Rockliff has accepted change is necessary.
"I also have to look at the way I act," Rockliff said.
He concedes the inappropriate tweet was a wake-up call.
"On reflection, you can see how stupid it looks and how ridiculous and insensitive it was," Rockliff said.
Rockliff will be hoping for an improved Lions outfit next season. Picture: AFL Photos
He knows there is a chance he may not continue as captain in 2017 but he doesn't intend dropping the ball for one second.
"Whether I'm captain or not in 2017, it's not going to change the way that I lead and encourage the boys," Rockliff said.
It won't be just this season that is crucial but whether he gives an indication that he can back it up again and again after showing what he was capable of in 2013-14 when he was sixth in a Brownlow Medal, All Australian and won his second club best and fairest.
Individual statistics won't matter either.
The main measure will be whether the midfield, which played like solo men in 2016, can gel as a unit.
Rockliff knows that is where his attention needs to go in the immediate future as he only aims to impress those who need him most.
"For me I have to find what it is that made me fall in love with the game," Rockliff said.
"[There is] fresh excitement around a new coach but challenges are going to come and I look forward to being the one that stands up during the year and says, 'Enough is enough'."
Enough is definitely enough when it comes to Rockliff.
"I've probably taken AFL footy for granted a little bit. You probably lose focus a little bit throughout your career at different stages," Rockliff said.
"I'll still get so much more to give and so much more to gain out of AFL football."
The stakes are high when you're creating two of TV's biggest dramas, but screenwriter Steven Moffat tells Paul Whitelaw why he wouldn't have it any other way
AS TIRELESS overseer of the multi-award-winning Doctor Who and Sherlock, two of Britain's biggest – and in the case of the former, most globally successful – TV dramas, Steven Moffat's pre-eminent position within the cultural firmament is at once impressive and unenviable. “I never find any time to relax,” he sighs. “At this very moment I'm supposed to be at a big lovely, boozy lunch that I had to call off because I haven't finished this Doctor Who script that I'm very late on.”
Not that he's necessarily complaining, you understand. Like his predecessor on Doctor Who, Russell T Davies, the Paisley-born writer has been a devoted fan of the series since childhood so it's little wonder that his slight edge of weariness pales compared to his evident enjoyment of the job.
Although he admits there are days when he wants to run screaming from the room, he claims it's not because of the programmes themselves, “but all the stuff that surrounds it can be... not so much bad as relentless. I have one of those jobs that a lot of people have, where I check my emails in the morning with trepidation. You know, is there a bomb in here, what am I unwrapping today? But in the main I wouldn't be here if I didn't love it.”
Although Moffat can often come across as rather prickly in interviews, the man I speak to makes for amusing and avuncular company. At the risk of sinking into armchair psychology mode, he exhibits that not uncommon combination – at least amongst creative types – of shyness, self-deprecation and utmost confidence. The latter is hardly surprising, and certainly deserved, since he's one of the most fêted screenwriters of his generation, renowned for his sly wit, quicksilver dialogue, vibrant imagination and structurally ingenious plotting.
It was that very audacity which led several otherwise intelligent adult critics to complain that the most recent series of Doctor Who – Moffat's second in the showrunner chair – was far too complicated for children. But he's having none of it.
“When you say ‘adult critics', there's about three,” he jokes. “The truth is we don't have any audience feedback about it being desperately hard to follow. All the kids got who River Song was, all the kids knew that the little girl regenerating would turn out to be River. It really isn't that hard to follow.”
There has been some confusion surrounding the scheduling of the next series, with conflicting reports suggesting not all of the 14 episodes will be shown in 2012. Can he clarify? “I can clarify that we start shooting in mid-February, but I can't tell you what the schedule is. What headlines are you planning for that time of year? I've only just found out what the transmission schedule is for Sherlock, and I've finished making that. I've barely started writing Doctor Who. Loads of things are in flux, all for good reasons actually.”
Moffat hasn't yet seen the headlines revealing that Karen Gillan's Amy Pond will meet a “heartbreaking” end in 2012. He can confirm, however, that the next series is part of his grand plan to remove Doctor Who from its usual spring/summer slot and back to the wintry habitat it enjoyed when he was growing up. “It's done very well in the summer, it's not like we've ever suffered from it, but it's almost like an aesthetic thing. If you're having to close the curtains so you can see the screen, that's not a good time to be watching a show that's largely about tunnels and torches. I think it's a show you watch in the dark.”
As for the 50th anniversary in 2013, Moffat has already promised an appropriately special episode, although when pressed he teasingly replies, “Why talk in the singular? Again, genuinely, the plans are at an early stage, but we have some very clear ideas about some of the things we're doing, and I think Doctor Who fans and kids will think it's the best thing ever. We've got a load of very big plans – the mere fact that we're talking about this two years before the event should tell you how seriously we're taking it.”
Fans are clamouring for an anniversary special featuring current incumbent Matt Smith alongside many of the previous Doctors, I venture. “Apparently,” he shrugs with a laugh, with nothing more to say on the matter.
Extracting new information about the revived Doctor Who has never been easy. A magnet for rumour and misinformation, the series attracted confusion again recently when Harry Potter director David Yates claimed he was making a rebooted movie version with an entirely different cast and mythology. “It's completely inaccurate!” says Moffat. “There's nothing there. I mean it would be lovely, yes. If anything, the only good bit about this is that it might actually focus our minds on thinking that we actually should do a film. But to state the bleeding obvious, it's not going to be a different version of Doctor Who with two different Doctors at the same time. Of course not, we're not that silly. That would be no way to run a franchise, would it? I'd love it to happen, but that version you heard was just a guy getting cornered on the red carpet and not really being on-message.”
When asked what it is that attracts him to such flamboyant characters as the Doctor and Sherlock Holmes, he unequivocally cites their brainpower and thirst for knowledge.
“The thing that unites both those shows is that they absolutely fetishise intelligence. In the Clarkson-isation of television I think it's rather good that we have two very popular drama series that expect the audience to be intelligent, and are right in that expectation. The only superpower those two heroes have is the fact that they're smarter than anybody else in the room. It says you don't have to be the fastest, the best-looking, the sexiest, you can just be smart. You don't often get the message, especially in American movies, that smart is good, that smart doesn't have to be geeky and silly, it can actually be amazing and powerful. And particularly in the case of the Doctor, he's such a moral man, he's a good, clever man, that's all he is. I think that's about as positive a message as you could possibly give.”
The Doctor and Holmes aside, Moffat also previously reinvented the tale of Doctor Jekyll And Mr Hyde for the BBC, and recently wrote the Tintin movie for Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. Are there any other iconic fictional characters he'd like to get his hands on? “When Mark [Gatiss, co-creator of Sherlock] and I get together we discuss Doctor Who, Sherlock Holmes and James Bond, and I keep saying, ‘Oh, we can't do James Bond because there has to be something left that's still fiction for us!' I love those films, but I think I shouldn't write that because then I'll ruin James Bond for myself.”
It's probably just as well, as he wouldn't have the time. Nevertheless, it looks as though he'll be steering the adventures of the Time Lord for at least a while yet. “I genuinely haven't got a plan,” he claims, “except I'll probably have to stop at some point or I'll die. And dying would be bad. But my main concern is not so much how long I do it, but that I absolutely, definitely am I going to be handing it on to somebody else. I want it to be in great shape, and some day I want somebody else to come in and knock my socks off with what they do with it. You don't want to be the last person in the relay race, do you?” v
