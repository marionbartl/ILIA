UPDF Starts Hunt for Congo Rebel Leader
By Andrew Cohen Amvesi
The Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) has announced plans to kick-start strategic investigations into alleged claims of Congolese rebel groups operating in West Nile region.
Lt. Ahmad Hassan Kato, the UPDF 4th Division Spokesperson told this website in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the Army is going to subject the rebel claims into thorough investigations which may lead to the arrest of its leaders.
Kato was reacting to the allegations made by Dr. Jefferson Abdallah Pene Mbaka, the governor of Ituri Province in Eastern DRC that West Nile districts of Koboko and Arua are harboring the M18 and the Army for the liberation of the people of Congo (ALPC), a new rebel outfit fighting the government of Joseph Kabila.
According to Mbaka, ALPC is currently operating under the leadership of a one Taban Ayiki, whom he said is currently hiding in Arua town.
Mbaka made the allegations during a closed door meeting attended by top security officers from both DRC and Uganda at Shammah 2 Hotel in Aruu town, Eastern DRC.
“The information we have received indicates that the two Congolese rebel groups are currently active with their bases in Koboko, Maracha and Arua districts,” Mbaka said.
Mbaka went ahead to claim that that the M18 are in between Koboko and Arua trying to reorganize to attack Kabila's government.
“We rely on the will of Uganda government to neutralize the two rebel groups so that their leaders can be arrested and surrendered to Kinshasha government,” Mbaka noted.
Lt Kato said that the army is ready to integrate the rebels into Congo Army and give amnesty to those, who are not willing to join the force.
“We are giving the claims a benefit of no doubt, and as a result, we are going to find out whether we have a person (rebel leader) of the names, Taban Ayiki,” Kato said.
“As UPDF, we shall see how we can dig out facts about this man, and if we find out that truly, he is a rebel leader and hiding in Arua, we shall arrest and hand him over to Congolese government as requested,” Kato explained.
Kato also observed that Ugandan government is in good books with the Congolese government, adding that it is for this reason that Uganda will never provide grounds for harboring Congolese rebels.
Bumblebee colonies are at risk of extinction after pesticide exposure says study
Pesticide puts bumblebee colonies at risk
A widely used pesticide is placing bumblebee populations at an increased risk of extinction, a new study from an Ontario researcher suggests.
Nigel Raine, an environmental science professor at the University of Guelph, discovered that thiamethoxam, a major neonicotinoid found in agricultural crops throughout the world, reduced the chances of bumblebee queens starting new colonies by more than a quarter.
The results were published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.
“Bumblebee queens that were exposed to the pesticide were 26 per cent less likely to lay eggs to start a colony,” Raine said of the research conducted in his lab with researchers from Royal Holloway, University of London.
“It was a bigger impact than I was expecting. And our modelling suggests it could have a major impact on population persistence and increases the chances a population could go extinct.”
Bees are crucial to agriculture. Published reports suggest about a third of the crops eaten by humans depend on insect pollination, with bees responsible for about 80 per cent of that figure.
But bee populations are declining worldwide as scientists try to figure out why. Research has suggested the use of neonicotinoids is among the factors contributing to the declines.
Ontario has taken the lead in North America by placing restrictions on the use of neonicotinoids, while Europe has imposed a moratorium on their use.
Recent research by York University showed neonicotinoids had spilled over from crops such as soy and corn in Ontario and Quebec into plants and wildflowers such as maple trees, dandelions and clover.
Raine wanted to examine the effects thiamethoxam and a common parasite had on the bumblebee queen's ability to set up a colony, a crucial part of a bee's life cycle.
Bumblebee queens, he explained, are quite different from honeybee queens in that they largely do all of the work themselves to start a colony, from foraging to nest building to raising their young before worker bees take over.
While there has been much study of the honeybee, not as much research has been conducted on the bumblebee, Raine said.
In his lab, Raine infected half the bumblebee queens he was studying with a parasite and then placed all the bees in a cold, dark room to force an artificial hibernation. Those that survived hibernation were then split into two more groups, one of which was exposed for two weeks to pesticide-laden pollen at “field realistic” levels found in the wild, he said.
Those queen bees were placed in different nest boxes and monitored for survival and signs of egg laying.
“There was very little effect of the parasite in our experiment,” Raine said.
But he did find a substantial impact on egg laying.
“We are trying to link all this up to the broader ecology and life history of these organisms,” Raine said.
He took that new data and plugged it into mathematical models to see what would happen over time.
“We're seeing a substantial increase of the likelihood of them not surviving over a longer period of time and that's obviously a serious concern with the current patterns of usage of these chemicals.”
If anything, Raine said, his study is conservative, considering he only examined the effects of one pesticide and one parasite, whereas there are many other factors in the wild that play a role in the bumblebee's health, including disease and habitat destruction.

Many drivers will receive refunds on their green slips in the coming months.
Many drivers will receive refunds on their green slips in the coming months.
NORTHERN Rivers motorists can now claim a partial refund on their Green Slips.
The NSW Government last year overhauled the old CTP Green Slip Scheme to create a more affordable, lower cost scheme. In addition to lower premiums in 2018, partial refunds will be given for insurance premiums paid in 2017 based on the old scheme.
Ballina MP Tamara Smith said more than 40,000 motor vehicle owners across the Ballina electorate will now be able to access their CTP Green Slip refund.
"The new CTP scheme is delivering savings for motorists. The average Green Slip price this year across the local area will be $423, down from $481 last year,” Ms Smith said.
Refund amounts will differ between motorists depending on when they renewed their Green Slip. The closer to 1 December 2017 a motorist paid their premium, the larger the refund.
Member for Clarence Chris Gulaptis said Greenslip refunds were also available for 68,000 Clarence and Richmond Valley motorists.
Mr Gulaptis said $29 million will be returned to vehicle owners across Northern NSW.
"Public transport users have not been forgotten with regional train fares falling by nearly one third,” Mr Gulaptis said.
Minister for Finance, Services and Property Victor Dominello said as a result of the government's reforms, more than $29 million will be returned to vehicle owners across Northern NSW. The average refund is $43.
"The new CTP scheme is delivering a big win for motorists through lower premiums, greater protections for those injured on the road and refunds on premiums paid during 2017,” Mr Dominello said.
People with a MyServiceNSW email account can expect to receive an email advising them they are entitled to a refund. The refund will be processed through their MyServiceNSW account and paid into a bank account of their choice.
Vehicle owners who do not have a MyServiceNSW account can check online if they are eligible for a refund at www.service.nsw.nsw.gov.au/greensliprefund or by visiting their local Service NSW Centre before creating an account.
Refunds will be available in the coming days and weeks and are available until September 30, 2018.

Panchayat Minister Mauvin Godinho on Wednesday said sarpanchas will be given full autonomy and that there will be no interference by the government as regards functioning of the panchayats.
Speaking to media in Vasco on the sidelines of the panchayat results, he said that the panchayati system needs to be strengthened at the grassroots level.
“The first important thing for the sarpanchas will be to keep their villages and surroundings clean from garbage and plastic,” said Godinho.
He said the state government has decided to initiate steps to tackle garbage menace and free villages from this problem.
The minister also opined that the panchayats need to launch awareness programmes to educate citizens on their basic civic duties towards keeping their surroundings clean.
On youth as young as 21-year-olds getting elected in the panchayat elections, Godinho said that “it is a very good sign of building of the new leadership for the future because it is through the panchayats the future leaders will grow and we can see talents coming from every nook and corner.”
He further mentioned that the coalition government in the state has been largely accepted by the people of Goa.
He said that though the elections have not been fought on party lines, it is clear from those elected that BJP has fared better.
Meanwhile, Godinho on Wednesday took charge of his official cabin allocated to him at the Secretariat in Porvorim. He has directed the panchayat authorities to initiate immediate measures to curb garbage menace in all the panchayat areas, especially those coming under the radius of flying zone at Dabolim airport which include Chicalim, Chicolna-Bogmalo and Sancoale.

Family members of various fishermen, who are still missing following cyclone Ockhi, stage a protest near the sea shore seeking central and state government agencies to step up the search operations in Kanyakumari. Photo: PTI
Chennai: The day the India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) launched its campaign for the RK Nagar bypolls on a development plank, thousands of fisherfolk staged protests against government inaction in the aftermath of cyclone Ockhi.
On 7 December, Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his deputy O. Panneerselvam kicked off the ruling AIADMK's campaign for RK Nagar bypolls slated for 21 December. They were seeking votes to “continue the developmental work” in late chief minister J. Jayalalithaa's constituency that has about 50,000 fisherfolk.
On the same day, 700 kilometres away on the southern tip of the country— Kanyakumari—thousands of fisherfolk from about eight fishing villages protested against the inaction by the state and central governments in expediting the rescue operations to trace the several thousand fishermen who went missing after cyclone Ockhi hit the coastline on 29-30 November.
“Votes in RK Nagar is their priority. Not us,” said John Leonard, a fisherman from Enayam Puthenthurai village in Kanyakumari district, and president of fishermen association Neithal Ezhuchi Peravai.
The fishermen of Kanyakumari have been demanding a visit from the chief minister and the deputy CM; the chief minister is expected to visit the district on Tuesday.
The fisherfolk marched more than 10 kilometres from various fishing hamlets to reach the Kuzhithurai railway station. They shouted slogans demanding that cyclone Ockhi be declared a national calamity.
Fisherfolk are also not happy with the response of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is also the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority. A release from the Tamil Nadu state government on 1 December said the prime minister had assured the chief minister in a telephonic conversation “to give the required assistance”.
“Before seeking help from the centre to send out the Navy, the state should have sent the Coast Guard for rescue work on 1 December, but they flung into action only on the 5th,” said Leonard.
As protests, demonstrations and processions intensified across the Kanyakumari district, cases were registered against at least 15,000 people, following protests on 7 December. The Deccan Chronicle quoted Kanyakumari district SP M. Durai, saying cases have been booked under section 341 of the IPC for blocking rail traffic and public vehicle movement, under section 143 for unlawful assembly and under section 188 for disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.
Leonard said the state and central governments should “extend their search beyond 150 nautical miles”.
“Our fishermen are involved in deep sea fishing and with the fiery cyclone, they could have gone even deeper into the sea,” he added.
Over the last two weeks, fishermen have been questioning the delayed warning that was issued by the government regarding the cyclone. The state government issued the cyclone warning on 29 November evening—by then the cyclone had already hit the coast.
There are discrepancies in the number of missing fishermen and accurate data is unavailable. The government had initially claimed that only few fishermen were missing.
A statement from the chief minister Palaniswami on 1 December said that 76 fishermen had been rescued and efforts were on to trace 30 others who went missing. However, the number of fishermen who are yet to return from the sea has climbed up. As many as 623 fishermen from Kanyakumari district are yet to be traced, said collector Sajjan Singh R. Chavan on Sunday.
According to the government, some fishermen are on safe shores in Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Lakshadweep.
“If the Coast Guard and the Navy had acted swiftly, we could have saved many lives. The response from the both the centre and state has been pathetic. What is the purpose of the government, if it doesn't help its people?” asked Leonard.

For the first time since joining the Horizon League in 2013, the Oakland men's basketball team was tabbed the preseason favorite to win the conference this season on Friday.
Oakland, the reigning regular-season champions, received 31 of the 47 first-place votes in a poll that was voted on by the league's head coaches, sports information directors and media members.
It's the first time the Golden Grizzlies have been selected to win their league since 2010 when they were a member of the Summit League.
Detroit Mercy received one first-place vote and is picked to finish fourth.
The Golden Grizzlies also landed the most players on preseason all-conference teams, with senior forward Jalen Hayes and senior guard Martez Walker being named to the first team and Illinois transfer Kendrick Nunn to the second team.
Hayes, a two-time all-league selection, recorded nine double-doubles and finished third in scoring (17.9 points) and second in rebounding (9.2) during conference games last season. Walker, who earned second-team all-conference honors last year, led Oakland in scoring (17.8 points), minutes (33.7) and games with at least 20 points (15).
Nunn averaged 15.5 points at Illinois in 2015-16 before sitting out last season due to transfer rules.
Detroit Mercy senior forward Jaleel Hogan and sophomore guard Corey Allen garnered preseason second-team honors. In conference play last year, Hogan averaged 16.9 points and 6.9 rebounds, and Allen averaged 15.4 points en route to being named the Horizon League Freshman of the Year.

PanARMENIAN.Net - A Rutgers University professor accused of posting anti-Semitic rants on his Facebook page, including accusing Jews of masterminding the Armenian Genocide, will lose his role as a director and no longer will be allowed to teach required classes, the school announced, Fox News reports.
Michael Chikindas, a professor in the food science department, reportedly posted dozens of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel comments on his page over several months, as Fox News has reported.
One of his posts said the Armenian Genocide was orchestrated by Jews, for example. Although the professor claimed his Facebook page was hacked, he did not deny sharing some of the images, comments and cartoons considered to be anti-Semitic.
Rutgers President Robert Barchi, who previously said the professor's posts were protected by “academic freedom,” said in a statement to the university community that Chikindas no longer will teach required courses and will be removed from his post as director of the Center for Digestive Health at the Institute for Food, Nutrition and Health.
Chikindas, a professor at Rutgers since 1998 who earned tenure in 2007, will undergo cultural sensitivity training and will be “subject to ongoing monitoring if and when he returns to the classroom,” Barchi said.
“This has been a sad and deeply troubling situation for our students and our staff, and for our faculty, who stand for much nobler values than those expressed by this particular professor,” Barchi told the university in his statement.

Last year, a group of CSUSM students and military veterans received news that a fellow student veteran had been diagnosed with cancer.
Inspired to take action, the group rallied together and garnered support for the student by holding an event where attendees shaved their heads in a noble act of solidarity.
Additionally, the group raised money for the Fisher House Foundation which, according to the foundation's website, “… is best known for a network of comfort homes where military and veterans' families can stay, at no cost, while a loved one is receiving treatment.” The foundation served over 30,000 families in 2016 and provided 11,000 students with $18 million in scholarships.
The event found significant success and is planning to hold its second installment on Saturday, Feb. 18 in Sunset Park, San Marcos from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The event will feature, catering from Two Brothers from Italy Pizza and have 30 classic cars on display, courtesy of Visions Car Club.
Every donation made on Saturday will be given to the Fisher House Foundation and the Military Heroes Campaign, a military veteran and family aid. As popularity for the event increases in time, the group will look to expand their efforts further through San Diego County.
A website is currently under construction by the CSUSM group that will allow users to donate and find more information on the group's efforts. In the meantime, inquiries can be directed towards [email protected] and [email protected]
Chloe Eudaly is about three weeks into her new job. And as career transitions go, hers has been eventful.
“It's hard to avoid cliches,” Eudaly told OPB, “so I'm just going to say it: It's been a whirlwind in the middle of a snowstorm.”
Eudaly started work as Portland's newest commissioner amid a winter weather event that shut down city offices, just as she was getting her bearings.
In a town wracked by tumultuous gentrification, Chloe Eudaly is a single mom and a renter. With no elected experience, she scored a huge upset victory over a one-term incumbent. And as Portland's weirder side is under the gun, Eudaly comes to City Hall with 22 years experience running her small independent bookstore, Reading Frenzy.
Eudaly's soft-spoken presence has already defused at least one tense situation. On Wednesday, protestors repeatedly disrupted a city council meeting, speaking out about police force and homelessness. Joe Walsh, a council meeting regular, told Mayor Ted Wheeler in no uncertain terms what he thought of Wheeler's one-minute limit on each public comment. It was Chloe Eudaly who brought the stunned room back online, even getting some approving call-outs from the audience.
But as Eudaly has been welcomed as a fresh voice on council, she's navigating tremendous change in her own life.
Eudaly closed her Mississippi Avenue bookstore, Reading Frenzy on Dec. 31, to comply with the city's conflict of interest laws. Hundreds of customers packing the store on its last day, snagging a few lasts books, zines and art prints.
“I made the joke to one of the people working here, I wouldn't have voted for her if I'd known Reading Frenzy would have closed,” writer Emilly Prado quipped. Prado said she appreciated how Eudaly went out of her way to stock up-and-coming writers, and titles that reflected city issues.
Customer Gus Kroll does church work with people living on the street, and for years looked to Reading Frenzy to fill his night table.
“There is a small pile of books ,” he said, “mostly on gentrification, houselessness, land-based politics — I've gotten here from Reading Frenzy,” Kroll said.
Kroll voted for Eudaly. He said he wants to feel better about the city's future. But while he's cautiously optimistic about Eudaly's new role, all politics has him on edge.
“Honestly it's terrifying,” Kroll said. “I'm not interested in looking for messiahs, but I'm cautiously optimistic about her position in the city council.”
Eudaly said it's been a shock, transitioning out of job she's done her entire adult life. But she added it hasn't been bad.
April Baer: What have the first few weeks been like?
Chloe Eudaly: It's been quite an introduction. We had to hit the ground running and got some pretty big assignments. We've dug right into that as well as putting in this emergency tenant protection ordinance. We've had our hands full.
Baer: Officeholders in Portland aren't allowed to maintain a business. When you decided to run, did the possibility of having to close Reading Frenzy cross your mind?
Eudaly: I think the most challenging thing for me is relentless meetings and demands made on me. It's really hard to simply check my email or read a document or think deeply about an issue, because I may have meetings booked back to back from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and I'm lucky if I get a lunch break. I think I've taken two days off since beginning the job. Saturday I had multiple events and a 17-hour day, which I haven't done in a while. It was satisfying. I got to connect with people in the community. It feels good. I couldn't do this job if I didn't love the work that I'm getting to do because it consumes most of your life.
Baer: Your bureau assignments involve supervising the Office of Neighborhood Involvement and the Bureau of Development Services. Any surprises out of the gate?
Eudaly: I don't think there have been many surprises. I think my biggest surprise is how many people are here to help us. Because I'm used to doing everything myself. So meeting with the city attorneys or the office of government relations — I was shocked to discover all these people work for us. They support the commissioners and the mayor and help us do our jobs. The bureaus really couldn't be more different, but they do dovetail in some regards, as well as my assignments to the joint committee on homelessness (A Home For Everyone).
Baer: Are you satisfied with your bureau assignments?
Eudaly: Oh yeah. Starting out, I had firm ideas about what I wanted, but the more I learned about City Hall, the deeper I got into the campaign, I realized there's important work to be done in any bureau. I'd been saying for months I'd be happy with any bureau I get. BDS was a surprise, because I don't think it's an obvious fit for my strengths, necessarily.
Baer: Just to unpack that, BDS is where a lot of permitting gets handled, and architectural and structural minutiae get sorted through. And it's a place that has interface with a lot of builders and developers. Your background is advocacy. You feel like it's a good place to do what you want to do?
Eudaly: Yeah, maybe that's one of the surprises is seeing BDS as this monolithic bureau that does things that I and most of the public do not understand, and realizing, no, BDS is essential to development in the city. We can make it easier or harder for developers to building housing. We can facilitate affordable housing, figure out ways to incentivize affordable housing. We also do rental inspections, Airbnb enforcement, urban canopy enforcement, so it actually is home to a lot of smaller items that are of great concern to me. I am, again, pleasantly surprised in figuring out where I can best connect with this bureau and have the biggest impact. And the big focus right now is making sure we are supporting developers in building affordable housing to the greatest extent we can.
Baer: Your orientation toward the city has been through the lens of Reading Frenzy, talking to writers and artists. Do you think about how you'll stay in touch with those people?
Eudaly: I'm thinking more about how I'll stay in touch with my own family, at this point!
Baer: You have a kid who's school-age?
Eudaly: I do. And in the mornings I give him an extra long hug, because I know I may not see him again until the next morning. That's been tough, but I know the workflow will ebb and flow, and as I get more accustomed to how things work here I'm going to figure out how to carve personal time out. I just want to dig in and get my bearings and get stuff done right now. As far as staying connected, I brought Pollyanna Birge with me . She worked for me at Reading Frenzy many, many years ago. She served as the director of IPRC several years ago, and also worked in Sam Adams' office as a cultural liaison. Polly and I are excited about how we can open the doors back up to City Hall. I'm excited about that piece of it, but that's not the priority of our office right now. It's going to take some time, but we're going to establish some new traditions here, I think.

Jurgen Klopp has insisted he has no problems with Virgil van Dijk's fitness...and his struggles so far “are only to be expected”.
And the Liverpool manager hit back at suggestions from Reds old boy Jamie Carragher that the £75m record signing needs to lose weight, by joking: 'Jamie needs to lose weight more than him!”
Van Dijk was left out of the Reds side which won at Huddersfield in midweek, after struggling in his previous two matches when Liverpool lost to the bottom two Premier League clubs.
He also missed the incredible victory over Manchester City, but Klopp insisted the defender was always going to take time to settle in.
“Wow. I am sure Jamie needs to lose a little bit of weight, but I am not sure with Virgil it is the case,” Klopp said.

“He is a big and tall player, that is how it is. We have the best nutrition department and no-one came to me and said we need to work with him. Being fit means all of that so you have at the end more muscle than anything else. It is not an issue, not at all.
“I am very happy (with him), it is just exactly as clear as it would be. A few ups and downs and we will see Virgil van Dijk at his best after the summer but we don't have the time to wait until then and why should we?”
Klopp believes that van Dijk's struggles so far are purely down to fitness levels after missing much of the first half of the season at Southampton through injury.
And he also explained that the most expensive defender in the world still needs time to adjust to a new system.
“It is quite difficult because our defending style is different to Southampton or to Holland so that's why it makes so much sense you get used to it.
(Image: Getty Images Europe)
“At the moment it is like I expect to be honest, completely normal. At Huddersfield, (being left out) it was purely a physical thing. When Virgil came here he was not fit, that is the truth.
“He had a long injury, then he played, then he was injured, then the transfer was kind of an open case and he didn't play for Southampton so it was not a consistent season so far.
“I don't know long enough to say 'Yes you can play all three games in a week in this moment. That is why Virgil didn't play. I spoke to him and he expected it.
“He is still a new player but you cannot train in a Premier League match so we need to use the time between the matches and in the matches we have to deliver.”
Van Dijk looks set to return against Spurs at the weekend, while Gino Wijnaldum should also come back into the midfield.

Next time some gun prohibition lobbyist starts whining on national television or in the pages of the local newspaper about the “well-funded gun lobby,” you just might want to respond with some information dug up by KATU in Portland, Oregon that essentially puts the dollar in the other wallet.
This report revealed that in Oregon — which is considered a politically “blue” state where liberal anti-gun Democrats seem to run things — it turns out that in 2016, anti-gunners actually got more than six times the amount of contributions as pro-gun politicians. And that, if you break out the pocket calculator and do some math, might be a bit on the low side.
Keep in mind, this spending pattern seems to be spreading across the country as anti-gun organizations use money as a weapon.
That year, the gun control crowd in Salem — the Oregon state capitol — reportedly pulled in $538,288.36 while politicians considered supportive of Second Amendment rights received $52,312.73. That includes contributions from the National Rifle Association, invariably demonized as a bunch of gun nuts that go around buying elections and politicians. Based on the KATU report, there might be some questions about who can be bought, or at least how expensive they are.
Back in 2016, the Reuters news agency reported that anti-gun billionaire Michael Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety lobbying group spent a fortune pushing its gun control agenda. Their Nevada campaign to push so-called “universal background checks” in a measure that was apparently so poorly written that it could not be enforced collected some $14.3 million to push the successful initiative. On the other side, Second Amendment activists could only raise $4.8 million to fight them.
Bloomberg and other elitist billionaires who can afford their own armed security see nothing wrong with spending millions of dollars to prevent law-abiding citizens from arming themselves. Safety is good for them, not so good for everyone else, evidently.
If gun owners are going to be at least competitive against the big bucks gun prohibition lobby, they will need to set aside some money each month, perhaps the cost of a couple of boxes of ammunition, and send it to their favorite Second Amendment group. There are plenty of them on the landscape including the NRA, Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Second Amendment Foundation (their forte is legal action rather than lobbying), Gun Owners of America or some other state or local rights group.
Last year, according to Politico, Bloomberg's Everytown group promised to spend more than $25 million on political races this year. That's the equivalent of pocket change for a billionaire. One of their main targets is concealed carry reciprocity. They want to derail it, and if it passes they will want to politically punish the politicians who voted to pass it.
CCRKBA Legislative Priorities Include Reciprocity
By no small coincidence, CCW reciprocity is high on the agenda for one national rights organization, the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms.
This sister-organization to the Second Amendment Foundation is a grassroots education and support group, chaired by Alan Gottlieb, the SAF founder. In a statement released to the press, he said CCRKBA needs to raise “at least $2.1 million for our direct and grassroots lobbying efforts,' which is not really that large a chunk of cash in political terms.
In addition to concealed carry, Gottlieb wants the proposed Hearing Protection Act passed. That's the one to remove the paperwork from the purchase of a silencer, removing the devices from the 1934 National Firearms Act.
At the state level, Gottlieb said CCRKBA is focused on California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington. In the latter state, he has already testified before a state Senate committee in opposition to several gun control proposals that included bans on “bump stocks” and original capacity ammunition magazines.
That hearing also saw unified testimony from NRA and the Firearms Policy Coalition. The event drew hundreds of Evergreen State gun owners, and hundreds of anti-gunners were bused in by the well-financed Alliance for Gun Responsibility, a Seattle-based organization.
Interesting Data About Accidental Deaths
Some interesting numbers recently surfaced, courtesy NPR, which reported, “accidental deaths rose significantly in 2016, becoming the third-leading cause of fatalities for the first time in more than a century.”
Was it gunned? Apparently not. The trend, according to the National Safety Council, was “fueled by the steep rise in opioid overdoses.”
“Accidents — defined by the council as unintentional, preventable injuries — claimed a record 161,374 lives in 2016, a 10 percent increase over 2015,” NPR reported. “They include motor vehicle crashes, falls, drowning, choking and poisoning, a category that encompasses accidental overdoses.”
The top causes of “preventable” deaths were listed in order as poisoning, motor vehicles, falls, choking, drowning, fire, flames and smoke, followed by “all other.”
On Jan. 1, the Los Angeles Times reported, “There were 489 people killed in unintentional shootings in the U.S. in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. That was down from 824 deaths in 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Taking into account population growth over that time, the rate fell 48%.”
Accidental fatal shootings may have climbed in 2016, but it is significant that these deaths probably ended up in the “all other” category. As noted by the Times, “Accidents made up just 1.3% of the 36,247 U.S. shooting deaths in 2015.”
Now here's something to stimulate your gray matter. In Seattle, Washington there is an effort to provide a “safe injection site” for heroin users. They'll be able to go to this place, shoot up on dope they supply (maybe via property crimes or something more serious) and not worry about being arrested. Meanwhile, the Seattle city government wants more gun control affecting people who don't commit crimes.

It took the Miami hockey team some time to get going in its first game in three weeks, but once the RedHawks did on New Year's Eve against Ohio State, the Buckeyes didn't seem to have an answer. Miami used a four-goal third period to take down the no. 9/10 Buckeyes 6-3 on their home ice in Columbus.
Recovering From a Rough Start
The game could not have started much worse for the RedHawks. On the opening shift, Ohio State's Tommy Parran sent the puck on net from the center red line. It eluded Miami goalie Ryan Larkin to give the Buckeyes the lead nine seconds into the contest
“Any time you give up a goal like that you kind of wonder if it's gonna be your night or not,” Miami head coach Enrico Blasi said.
Ohio State extended the lead to 2-0 before Miami responded with goals in the closing seconds of the first period and opening minutes of the second to tie the game at 2-2. The RedHawks carried the play for stretches of the second period following the tying goal, but the Buckeyes regained the lead on David Gust's goal at the 17:25 mark. The game, however, was far from over.
“I think we knew the whole game that we could beat them if we just stuck to our game and played hard,” Miami freshman Carson Meyer said. “Some guys spoke up in the second intermission and we came out with a little fire in the third and we just finished our chances, that's all it came down to.”
Miami dominated the third period, outshooting Ohio State 14-1 in the final frame. Ohio State goalie Christian Frey made some big saves to maintain the lead for the first half of the period, but he could not keep the RedHawks at bay. Miami scored three times in a 3:34 span to turn a 3-2 deficit into a 5-3 lead, then added an empty-net goal for good measure.
That'll do it, we score 4 3rd-period goals to top Ohio State 6-3! #RiseUpRedHawks pic.twitter.com/hd2rjuGZyK — The Brotherhood® (@MiamiOH_Hockey) December 31, 2016
“Obviously it wasn't the start that we wanted but I think that we responded well,” Miami sophomore Kiefer Sherwood said. “We know we have a good team here, we really believe it, and when we play like that and continually get better I think we're gonna be a tough team to beat.”
Ohio State outshot Miami 8-7 in the first period but managed just seven shots on goal in the next two periods combined. The New Year's Eve tilt was the first game after long breaks for both teams, and while Ohio State enjoyed a better start than Miami, the Buckeyes did not do enough to win.
“We just didn't take care of the puck…we didn't play with a sense of urgency,” Ohio State head coach Steve Rohlik said in a postgame press conference. “When you're playing a very good hockey team, you gotta bring it. There's no excuse.”
Central Ohioans Star in Columbus
As if the loss wasn't bad enough for the Buckeyes, two players who helped fuel the RedHawk offense hail from the Columbus area in Meyer and Sherwood, who combined for three goals and four points in the win.
Great way for the boys to close out 2016 & start the 2nd half! Congrats to the #614 natives @KSherwood44 @Cmeys18! Happy New Year everyone https://t.co/OPU7SUcKWO — Nick Petraglia (@NickPetraglia) January 1, 2017
With Miami trailing 2-1 in the second period, an Ohio State turnover led to an odd-man rush for the RedHawks. Meyer finished the play by burying a feed from Anthony Louis for the fifth goal of his freshman season. Meyer also notched an assist in the game and said it was good to be back playing in Columbus, especially considering the result.
“It feels awesome,” Meyer said. “Obviously I got a bunch of friends and family in the crowd so it feels nice to get that goal and that win right in front of them.”
Sherwood also made some big plays in this return to central Ohio. Less than three minutes after Miami tied the game at three in the third period, he gave the RedHawks their first lead with what became the game-winning goal. Then, 53 seconds later, he buried his ninth goal of the season to give Miami some insurance on the way to winning its final game of 2016.
Conference Play's Coming
The New Year's Eve affair can be looked at as a one-game tune-up for both teams, as Miami and Ohio State now prepare for league games. The RedHawks sit seventh in the NCHC standings and look to make some progress this Friday and Saturday when they host St. Cloud State. While the Buckeyes are now in the midst of a five-game homestand, things aren't getting any easier for them. Ohio State hosts third-ranked Penn State Friday and Saturday in Big Ten action.
After Ezequiel Carrera fouled a ball off his right foot during the Blue Jays' 8-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday, the outfielder stumbled out of the batter's box, hobbling briefly before returning to the plate for a strikeout.A day later, Carrera was once again hobbling, this time on crutches, his foot in a walking boot. It turns out the seemingly innocuous incident was more serious than originally thought. Toronto put Carrera on the 10-day disabled list Wednesday with a fracture in the top of his right foot. That makes 16 Blue Jays players forced to the sidelines this season; Carrera's stint on the DL is the 20th for the team. Collectively, players have missed 478 games to injury. The Jays had spent 574 days on the disabled list before Carrera's injury, according to spotrac.com, fourth in the majors behind the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Texas Rangers and the New York Mets. The site estimates the cost of Toronto's disabled list before Carrera's injury was $17,316,865. It's a statistic manager John Gibbons, who didn't think anything of Carrera's plate appearance either, would prefer his team wasn't excelling in. Article Continued Below“I don't think I've seen it in half a season, put it that way. You stretch it out over a full season, it's probably common,” he said. Carrera, who has been in left field for 55 per cent of the Jays' game this season, was replaced by 24-year-old outfielder Dwight Smith Jr., both on the 25-man roster and in left field Tuesday night. The call-up from the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons appeared in three big-league games in May. The 30-year-old Carrera, who has been in Toronto for more than two seasons, knew the blow to his foot was hard but X-rays taken on Tuesday didn't show anything. It was only after he woke up on Wednesday morning unable to put weight on his foot that Carrera underwent a CT scan that showed the fracture. He was scheduled to see a specialist later in the day.
One example: I remember a garden party a few years ago, where the host had come up with a brilliant, simple menu of a tray of lasagna and a giant bowl of salad — both stellar family recipes.
For dessert, we had Klondike bars, straight from the freezer. It was an easygoing affair, and the lasagna delicious.
But there are some types of pasta — improvisational, perhaps — that can be expressions of a season's beginnings. These are the pastas I prefer just now, which are, for the most part, vegetable focused.
The other day, I came upon fresh peas in the pod and the first few bunches of new garlic shoots. While West Coast cooks have been blessed with these, and many other vegetables, for several weeks already, we on the East Coast are thrilled to finally have these harbingers of spring arrive at the market, especially this year, when winter's end has seemed more delayed than ever.
With that in mind, I set about to make pasta with peas. Normally, I would have been pleased to serve it with just a pat of butter and a bit of Parmesan, but a few other words came to mind, like pappardelle and pancetta. Then a little bunch of tender mustard greens caught my eye, so off they went into the basket, too.
Pappardelle is a great choice here: saucy juices like to cling to those wide, delicate ribbons. I could have made my own, but I was pressed for time. Thankfully, there are tasty imported dried versions sold in boxes, and fresh ones available at my local Italian deli.
Finding pancetta — Italian bacon, usually unsmoked — can be a bit more difficult, but regular smoked bacon is a fine substitute.
While not essential, a few lardons of pork give pasta with peas a nice boost. Whichever I use, I often simmer it in water for a minute or two, which tones down the smokiness a bit and renders some fat. Lemon zest and a quickly made herb pesto with basil, mint and parsley could round out the pasta's flavor, and a bit of fresh ricotta adds a creamy quality without adding richness.
Temperatures plummeted again the next day. But for our dinner, at least, spring had begun in earnest.
——
And to drink ...
With almost all pasta dishes, the wine is chosen to match the flavorings of the sauce. In this case, that's a combination of creamy ricotta, sharp herbs and spring-fresh peas, with savory pancetta accents — a combination that calls for a white.
The instinct with pasta is to think Italian, which offers many options, including pinot bianco from Alto Adige, vermentinos from Liguria and fianos from Campania. Just as good would be an array of French wines. I think a good white Bordeaux, made of a combination of sauvignon blanc and sémillon, would be great.
Or you could stick with sauvignon blanc alone, in an herbal, minerally Sancerre. Chablis would be delicious, as would a springlike sylvaner (also spelled silvaner) from Alsace. Come to think of it, Alto Adige makes excellent sylvaner as well. — ERIC ASIMOV

Islamabad
The inordinate delay in balloting of remaining Hajj applications has disappointed Hajj aspirants and government has been urged to resolve the dispute with Hajj Group Organisers (HGOs) for smooth implementation of Hajj Policy announced by the government in January.
It may be recalled that the government had already selected 50 percent aspirants of Government Hajj Scehme by holding a balloting earlier this month. The ministry had promised to conduct another balloting for selecting 17 percent more aspirant for performing the sacred religious ceremony under government scheme after settlement of dispute with HGOs, who got stay orders for reducing their share from 40 percent to 33 percent.
Last week, the Islamabad High Court had ordered the ministry to retain quota of HGOs to 40 percent. Thus the ministry should conduct balloting of 10 percent, said Hafiz Abdul Quddus, an aspirant of performing Hajj this year under government scheme. He said due to the unclear policy of the government regarding the Hajj quota, the balloting of remaining 10 percent Hajj application had not been announced so far thus causing disappointment to the applicants and their families.
The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony will initiate extensive Hajj training programme for intending pilgrims from current month, aimed at familiarizing pilgrims with Manasik Hajj. According to official sources, the pilgrims would be imparted training with the help of models, charts, maps, sketches, lectures and television. The focus of the programme would be the first timers those who were going to perform Hajj rituals first time. The training had been extended from district to tehsil level.
Informative booklets along with CDs would be distributed among the pilgrims free of charge. “The training also covers how to wear `Ahram' and observe sanctity of the holy places, besides performing Manasik at Madina Munawarrah and manners of offering prayers at Masjid-e-Nabvi and `Salam' at `Roza-e-Rasool (Peace Be Upon Him).” The official said the ministry also planned to administer seasonal vaccines to protect the intending pilgrims from viral diseases. As per directives of the Saudi authorities, the intending pilgrims would have to carry with them medical certificates of administration of vaccines.—APP

Lionsgate and sister company Roadside Attractions have acquired U.S. rights from Los Angeles Media Fund to Jesse Peretz's romantic comedy “Juliet, Naked,” starring Rose Byrne, Ethan Hawke, and Chris O'Dowd.
A summer release is planned for the film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 19.
The film is produced by Albert Berger & Ron Yerxa, Barry Mendel, Judd Apatow, and Jeffrey Soros. The executive producers are Simon Horsman, Nick Hornby, Thorsten Schumacher, and Patrick Murray.
Tamara Jenkins & Jim Taylor and Evgenia Peretz adapted the screenplay of “Juliet, Naked.” Rocket Science is handling international sales.
Byrne portrays a woman stuck in a long-term relationship with O'Dowd's character, who is a huge fan of an obscure rock musician named Tucker Crowe, played by Hawke. When the acoustic demo of his hit record from 25 years ago surfaces, its release leads to a life-changing encounter with the elusive rocker himself. It's based on Nick Hornby's best-selling novel.
Owen Gleiberman said in his Sundance review for Variety: “‘Juliet, Naked' is a gently winning romantic comedy, all keyed to a delightful note of indie-rock obsession. It's exactly the sort of movie you want to see at Sundance.”
“We're delighted to be teaming with Howard and Eric in bringing this fun and funny Sundance favorite to theaters,” said Lionsgate's Jason Constantine. “The filmmakers and the cast are incredibly talented and give justice to the comedy and originality of Nick's novel. We look forward to seeing audiences rock out to the film when it hits screens this year.”

Korean Boy band BTS will perform at the Billboard Music Awards next month as the first K-pop artist to do so.
Announcing the news on the band's official Twitter account Tuesday night, Big Hit Entertainment said the seven-member K-pop sensation will return to the BBMAs as a performer and debut its new single.
"Look out for our second appearance or - say what? - FIRST PERFORMANCE at the BBMAs!" the group wrote. It also thanked its fans, known as Army, for making the performance possible with their enormous support.
(Big Hit Entertainment)
The group is nominated for the Top Social Artist award for the second consecutive year. Last year, it won the award, beating such American top artists as Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.Two days prior to the scheduled performance, the group will drop its third regular album, "Love Yourself: Tear."The awards show, set to take place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, will air live on NBC on May 20. The show features other performers, including Dua Lipa, Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes. (Yonhap)
The new Jeep Wrangler heads for the hills
CASEY WILLIAMS | Auto Reviewer
autocasey@aol.com
When you're clinging to the side of a mountain, hanging in peril, you better have four capable wheels beneath you. So when one redesigns the Jeep Wrangler, it better look like a Jeep and it better master trails like one. In creating the new 2018 Wrangler, current customer expectations were paramount, but it's also a lot more enticing for the less adventurous.
The larger Wrangler's shape is instantly familiar, but stylists improved aerodynamics with a faster windshield rake and canted grille. Headlamps bend the outer slots of Jeep's trademark grille as did the classic CJ's. Fender vents look cool, but minimize hood flutter. LED headlamps, running lights, foglamps and taillights imbue a modern ethos. The jacked up and nostriled Rubicon model is especially menacing.
Gone is the cloth erector set of previous generations, replaced with a choice of tops that includes a proper hardtop, available with removable front panels, but that's where generations diverge. Integrated frame rails let the softtop fold back in about 15 seconds. Add another 15 seconds to slide off and stow the rear and side curtains. Or, choose Unlimited models with a one-touch power-opening canvas center section that reveals sky to both rows of seats. Absolutely brilliant.
Inside, designers were inspired by the CJ7's horizontal row of gauges, so they created a wide contrasting panel that connects the analog dials to round air vents and the new center console cradling Chrysler's baby-simple infotainment system. Click through icons for radio, media, climate and navigation on the touchscreen. Or use redundant buttons and knobs below. Or command by voice. Your choice.
Adding refinement, Sahara trim brings stitched dash coverings and soft-touch door panels. Rubicon models embrace red for the dash. While this may seem sacrilege for Jeep purists, you can choose heated seats and heated steering wheel. Beautiful, but Jeeps don't run on styling flourishes.
The base engine is a 3.6-liter V6 delivering 285 horsepower and 260 lb.-ft. of torque, but hold your Jerry because an optional 2.0-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, assisted by a light hybrid system, manages 270 horsepower and 295 lb.-ft. of torque. A 3.0-liter diesel arrives in 2019. Choose between a new shorter-throw 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission. Fuel economy for the V6 four-door rates 18/23-MPG city/highway.
On-road, rear axle hop and wandering steering are diminished. Launching down a rough gravel road, the suspension soaked it up more like a Grand Cherokee than classic Wrangler. The new automatic transmission added a level of calm never experienced in a Wrangler.
For those who think Jeep emasculated your beloved Wrangler, take a seat… and head for the hills. During our drive, Jeep guides plotted a course through cactus and boulders, heading straight up a mountainside. We shifted into 4Lo, locked differentials, electrically disconnected the sway bars, and gently eased up the face of Hell's rock garden, skid plates clanging away.

A WOMAN in her 60s has allegedly been attacked by an American soldier in the car park of Brisbane's Enoggera Army Barracks.
The victim was dragged from her car and assaulted by the 20-year-old Marine about 3.15pm on Tuesday, police say.
Military police along with an off-duty Queensland Police officer intervened and arrested the man, with the off-duty policeman also allegedly assaulted during the scuffle.
The woman, who is understood to be an Australian public servant, sustained serious injuries and was treated in hospital before being released.
Police said the man and woman were not known to each other and it wasn't known what sparked the attack.
The Defence department says it's providing support to the woman following the assault.
The American national has been charged with multiple offences including serious assault in relation to a person over 60, assaulting police and causing wilful damage in relation to the woman's car.
He's due to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on July 18.

Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas played in Game 1 against the Chicago Bulls less than 24 hours after learning his younger sister, Chyna, had been killed in a single-car accident across the country. He performed admirably, scoring a game-high 33 points in a disappointing four-point loss.
Before tip, television cameras captured Thomas crying courtside, being consoled by teammate Avery Bradley. His status remained in doubt. No one knew for sure how he'd cope with the situation.

Sports are great for many reasons — so many of them bigger than the actual game. Tragedy and the subsequent grief in the sports world provide a window into society as a whole. Heartbroken athletes persevere, sullen fans get lost in the distraction of a big game. Sports provide an outlet both to player and spectator alike.
But with good comes the bad. With the uplifting comes the troubling. Death is never easy or simple in any form and is almost always uncomfortable. Charles Barkley is currently in hot water for suggesting Thomas' tears were “a bad look” and made him feel “uncomfortable.” Barkley, per usual, did not choose his words carefully but there's some merit to his sentiments.
It is uncomfortable to watch a player cry. It is uncomfortable to know that their heart is breaking. It is uncomfortable to care about the game while that's going on.
And it's most uncomfortable when it's real and raw, like it was for Thomas on Sunday. There's something oddly addictive about cleanly packaged pain voiced by Tom Rinaldi. Immediate, soul-crushing pain without the flowery poetry is harder to handle.
While athletes are deified, they're just as often dismissed as human beings. We see them as entertainers or robots there to carry out calculating athletic skills. Their problems are diminished and sympathy withheld because they make a lot of money.
That's just the cost of doing business, we somehow say. But humanness should not be defined by salary. Thomas should not have had to live his grief out in public like that. He deserved better to have his every move scrutinized and his personal heartbreak become public. The choice he was forced to make Sunday was a personal one, but no one should ever have to make it.
It's sickening knowing that, deep down, Thomas is a story and not a person in the eyes of many. There's an enormous gulf between caring about the narrative for a few hours and caring about the person. Perhaps that's why I found it so uncomfortable to watch. Asking myself if my compassion for Thomas had a shelf life until the final whistle or if it was authentic gave reason for pause.
Death is always complicated. Not every sports story in the wake of death hits the same way. Thomas', for some reason, seemed so much more palpable than usual. It was easy to feel guilty watching and assessing his grief. It's a situation no person deserves to be in. He handled it well, but it was anything but comfortable.

Arsenal vs Bayern Munich SHOULD be a glamour tie that comes up once in a while.
Instead, thanks to some weird quirk of fate, it's the Champions League tie which seems to come up more often than some Premier League clashes. Remarkably, once this season's two-legged Last 16 clash is complete, the Gunners will have faced the German giants EIGHT times since 2012.
Which got us thinking…the packed recent history of this head-to-head give us the perfect chance to see how much Arsenal fans REALLY know about their team.

The quiz below contains the Arsenal line-ups from each of the Gunners' last five games against Bayern. All you have to do is fill in the names of the players… in less than ten minutes.
A few things to remember:
1. You only need to type in the player's surname.
2. There are 55 slots, but certain players will (of course) appear several times.
3. If you get a score of under 40, you are no longer allowed to call yourself an Arsenal fan.

Vice Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok (3rd from L) speaks at a meeting in Seoul with central bank and financial community officials on March 16, 2017, just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the key rate.(Yonhap)
The US Federal Reserve's interest rate hike is likely to worsen South Korea's rising household debt problem, dampening domestic demand and possibly hurting exports to emerging markets, experts said Thursday.The Fed raised the key rate by 0.25 percentage point to the 1-1.25 percent range Wednesday, its second hike this year, which was widely expected in the market.Along with Bank of Korea Gov. Lee Ju-yeol's recent hint at monetary tightening, the Fed's move raises concerns that higher market interest rates will weigh on Korean households, whose disposable income will be reduced due to higher repayments for their borrowing.Asia's fourth-largest economy has been bogged down by high rising household debt, which hit 1,359.6 trillion won as of the end of March. The ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Korea rose to 92.8 percent as of March, the third highest among 43 countries monitored by the Bank for International Settlements.“Korea's household debt has continued to rise, with the economy suffering a downturn for a long time. The recent growth in credit loans highlights that Koreans' disposable income has barely increased,” Sung Tae-yoon, an economics professor at Yonsei University, told The Korea Herald.“The US rate hike is likely to sap Korea's private consumption and domestic demand further. The financial regulator should tighten lending rules such as the debt-to-income ratio.”The Fed's rate hike could also have a negative impact on exporters to emerging markets, as higher interest rates in the US usually prompt global investors to move their funds from emerging markets, including China, to the US, observers said.Another concern is the possibility of a reversed interest rate gap between the US and Korea. If the Fed raises its rate again, possibly in September, the Fed's key rate will be higher than the BOK's key rate of 1.25 percent. In this situation, the reversed rate gap might prompt foreign investors to pull their funds from Korea and move to higher-yielding assets in the US.However, Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon brushed off such concerns, saying the impact of the Fed's rate increase on the Korean economy will be limited.“The US interest rate hike was already expected both by policymakers and the market,” Kim told reporters at a visit to a local IT firm in Seoul.“We're preparing various policy efforts to manage household debt. The government will announce comprehensive measures by the end of August.”Park Seong-woo, an analyst at NH Futures, said the household debt problem will make it difficult for the BOK to raise its rate this year, despite Gov. Lee's recent hint at monetary tightening.“Even if the BOK raises this year's growth forecast from 2.6 percent, consumption is still sluggish. Korea's core inflation is still too low at 1.4-1.5 percent, which enables the BOK to have some room to hold the rate,” Park said.The BOK's monetary policy committee will hold its next rate-setting meeting on July 13.By Kim Yoon-mi (yoonmi@heraldcorp.com)

New year, new you?
Many of us make New Years resolutions with every intention of keeping them, finally kicking the cigarettes , or drinking less, or calling our parents more.
With time though, these best-laid plans often fall by the wayside.
However, should you need some inspirations come January 2018, then look no further than Lexi Reed from Terre Haute, Indiana and her husband Danny.
In January 2016, Lexi weighed 220kgs and Danny 127kgs - the heaviest both of them had been.
The couple set themselves a resolution - to shed the weight.
There was no complex meal plan involved, no personal trainer and going down the surgery route was not an option.
Fast-forward almost two years and the transformation is both inspiring and incredible.
Lexi wrote on Instagram: "We didn't have a meal plan, surgery, personal trainer, but what we did have was each other and the motivation within to work hard every single day.
"We wanted to be parents in the future and live a longer life together. We had no idea that in just over a year and six months we would be a completely different couple. We may have lost the weight but we have grown closer together.
"Pound by pound, step by step, day by day - we have transformed our lives and moulded our bodies into the people we've always wanted to be."
Lexi also paid tribute to her husband, citing him as a huge inspiration and support.
She also revealed that, rather than taking its toll on their relationship, the demands of their routine had actually brought them closer together.
"This man has been by my side for the last 10 years and treated me no different at 485lbs than he does at 182lbs. We all deserve to live a life we are in love with and have people around that make it worth living."
Lexi and Danny's weight-loss journey has understandably inspired others, and it's proof that hard work really can pay off.
As Lexi herself says: "You won't always have the time - you will have to make the time. Tomorrow is a new day. Never give up on yourself & keep fighting my friends!"
Cassie Breen, a 2014 graduate of Woodhaven, has shined for the the Central Michigan University women's basketball team. The senior has netted 81 3-pointers this season and has a shooting percentage of 38.2 from behing the arc. Breen and the Chippewas (28-4) won the Mid-American Conference Tournament championship on March 10 and will play a first-round NCAA Tournament game on March 17. Digital First Media File Photo
The Central Michigan womens basketball team has danced its way into the NCAA Tournament for the first time in five years, and the team could not have done it without the help of two key players from the Downriver area.
Mid-American Conference Player of the Year and senior forward Tinara Moore (Southgate Anderson) and senior guard Cassie Breen (Woodhaven) have started and played in all of CMUs 32 games this season.
The Chippewas (28-4, 17-1 MAC West) will face Louisiana State in the first round of the tournament.
Overall, CMU has lost just one game this calendar year  a nail-biting 85-82 defeat at Buffalo on Feb. 14.

CMU went on to beat Buffalo in the MAC Tournament championship game, on March 10, by a score of 96-91 at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.
Moore rightfully earned the MAC Player of the Year for 2018, averaging 18.7 points per game (fourth in the MAC) with a 58.1 percent shooting percentage (second). She even managed to break Chippewas legend Crystal Bradfords single-season point record of 588 points during the MAC Championship game, where she scored 17 in the second half.
Moores former Anderson teammate Amani Corley is also on the CMU roster. The guard shined for the Chippewas in her first three seasons in Mt. Pleasant, but suffered an injury before the 2017-18 campaign kicked off and has been unable to play.
This winter, Moore also hit 79.9 percent of her free throws (155-of-194, sixth) and managed to add 313 rebounds (second) and 76 blocks, 15 more than the closest player in the conference  Buffalos Cassie Oursler.
The Southgate native scored 41 points and collected 35 rebounds and eight blocks in three MAC Tournament games. She wasnt the most valuable player in the MAC Championship Game  that honor went to junior forward Reyna Frost  but you could argue she was the MVP of the entire tournament.
Meanwhile, Breen continued to put up impressive numbers from beyond the 3-point line. She broke the school record for career 3-pointers. The previous record (288) was held by former Chippewa Niki DiGuilio. She also has scored more than 1,000 career points, and contributed 30 points in the MAC Tournament.
This season alone, Breen scored 81 3-pointers (fifth in the MAC) with a 38.2 3-point shooting percentage (81-of-212, eighth). She also scored 384 total points (23rd) for the Chippewas, which is no easy feat for the amount of pure scorers head coach Sue Guevara has on her team.
Moore and Breen will have to wait to extend their legacy in the biggest game of their career  11:30 a.m. this Saturday, March 17 in Columbus, Ohio against the LSU Tigers. The winner of that game will play either Ohio State University or George Washington University in the next round.
Willie Nelson cut short his concert in Salt Lake City on Sunday night after experiencing shortness of breath, according to Billboard.
In a tweet, Nelson blamed the venue's high elevation (and not his decades' worth of marijuana smoking). Though he was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, the 84-year-old country singer assured fans he was fine, writing, “I am feeling better now & headed for lower ground.”
This is Willie I am sorry to have to cut the SLC show short tonight The altitude got to me I am feeling better now & headed for lower ground — Willie Nelson (@WillieNelson) August 14, 2017
Nelson is on tour in support of his latest album, God's Problem Child, which arrived back in April. The album contains a track called “Still Not Dead”, which seems like an appropriate way to end this article.
April Gives Birth and It's a Boy!
April the Giraffe at Animal Adventure Park finally gave birth on Saturday after fans waited for weeks, hoping to witness the amazing event. The birth has made a frenzy in social media as well.
The birth was video streamed live from Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, attracting viewers from Facebook and Youtube. The video garnered 1.2 million views in Youtube and 800,000 views in the park's Facebook account.
The birth is also buzzing in media outlets. According to news reports, around five media outlets – both local and from Pennsylvania and New York City arrived at the park shortly after the birth. Several reporters also were spotted outside the parking lot for hours.
The Perfect Birth
The waiting game is finally over for millions of fans who spent weeks glued to their computer screens hoping to witness a giraffe give birth.
Finally, at 9:53 a.m. on Saturday, a calf greeted the world. The park's crew observed the labor by 7:20 a.m. and by 7:30 a.m., two baby hooves were sticking out. This alerted the park's crew that birth was imminent.
Jordan Patch, the park's owner, was elated by the birth and overwhelmed by millions of waiting fans wanting to watch the birthing process.
Patch said, “It was an absolutely perfect birthing process, it went exactly as planned.”
At 10:06 a.m., Patch announced on a Facebook Live post, “Perfect delivery, perfect fall.”
In addition, the park was delighted to announce that the calf was indeed a boy!
The Name Game
April's calf has no name yet. With this, delighted fans are invited to join in the park's invitation for the possible name of April and Oliver's little boy.
Any animal lovers are invited nominate a name for $1 on the park's GoFundMe page. The voting started Saturday evening. The funds will probably be used for giraffe conservation in the wild and giraffe care at Animal Adventure. Six names will be selected for a social media naming contest.
Meet the New Parents
April and Oliver are the new parents of the calf. April is a 15-year-old reticulated giraffe who came to the park in September 2015. Oliver, the calf's father, is five years old and he arrived at the park in May 2015.

ISTANBUL (AP) — The waters around Istanbul have turned a striking shade of turquoise.
A natural phenomenon called a "phytoplankton bloom" has turned the normally dark waters of the Bosporus and Golden Horn into an opaque tone of light blue. It's caused by microscopic organisms that have inundated the Black Sea, just north of Turkey's largest city.
Berat Haznedaroglu, an environmental engineer, says it's a normal annual event.
He said: "This year we got a lot of rain events that carried nutrients from the Saharan desert to the Black Sea, which created an optimal environment for this phytoplankton to bloom." Haznedaroglu works at the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Istanbul's private Bogazici University.
The Bosporus, a strait that separates Europe from Asia, also connects the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara.

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP)  Animal welfare groups are pushing SeaWorld to release more information about how Tilikum, the orca that killed a trainer at the company's Orlando park, died from an infection in January.
SeaWorld announced earlier this month that a necropsy revealed the whale had died from bacterial pneumonia. But the Orlando Sentinel (http://bit.ly/2lERM3K ) reports that groups want to know where the infection came from and if Tilikum had other injuries.
Tilikum was profiled in the documentary "Blackfish," which helped sway public opinion against keeping killer whales in captivity.
Details about deaths of whales and dolphins in captivity have been shielded from the public since 1994, when Congress amended the Marine Mammal Protection Act after industry lobbying.

SeaWorld officials say Tilikum's tissues are being used in studies that will be published when complete.

NEWBURY Racecourse station is in line for a makeover following a £70,000 investment.
The upgrade will include improved waiting facilities, covered cycle parking, a ticket vending machine, CCTV cameras and improvements to the footbridge.
The cash was secured from Great Western Railway's (GWR) customer and communities improvement fund, following a bid from West Berkshire Council.
The bidding process attracted 158 applications, totalling more than £4.4m, for improvements across the whole of the GWR network.
With only £750,000 available in the fund, the council's bid was considered one that stood out from the other requests.
West Berkshire Council's executive member for highways and transport, Jeanette Clifford (Con, Northcroft) said: “The news about this award is fantastic, especially given the strong competition for the funding available.
“Our bid won because of the well-established racecourse housing development, electrification of the rail line, the successful employment area almost next door – and because the council put together a really powerful case, working with our partners.
“It's a welcome and well-timed boost for Newbury Racecourse station, serving ever more travellers and businesses.
“I am sure the improvements will be welcomed by people who already use the station, as well as encourage new travellers to choose rail”.
The bid was supported by Thames Valley Berkshire's Local Enterprise Partnership and David Wilson Homes (DWH), which is delivering the 1,500 home development at Newbury Racecourse.
The GWR funding will be combined with £150,000 from developer money.
Project manager for DWH, Daniel Pavely, said: “David Wilson Homes was keen to support this bid for funding and the successful outcome is welcomed.
“We look forward to these improvements taking place and benefiting residents as well as visitors to the racecourse.
“To use our funding to attract even more is a great result and will help to boost our work through the residential travel plan for our site”.
The delivery of the scheme will be managed by GWR.
The works co-incide with a £6m upgrade for Newbury station.
Thames Valley Berkshire Local Enterprise Partnership has earmarked funds for the multi-million pound revamp, which will see improved connections for pedestrians, cyclists and those using public transport, with office space also planned.
A further £500,000 to provide 300 additional cycle spaces, along with bike pumps and repair equipment, has also been committed.

In Michigan vehicles aren't just a way to get around, they're a way of life.
Automotive manufacturing supports thousands of jobs all across the state and we're getting an update on the health of that industry.
“The auto industry nationally is healthy,” said Tim Nash, from Northwood University. “It's even more healthy in Michigan.”
Nash knows the auto industry bumper to bumper. He is an auto Industry expert at Northwood University. He co-authored the school's latest automotive industry report. Nash said the auto industry, that was hit hard by the great recession, is starting to recover.
“We added about 5,000 jobs this past year in Michigan and over half of those were in the auto industry,” Nash said.
According to the report, in 2016 there were
944,000 auto-related jobs, representing 20 percent of the state's workforce
$30 billion in auto sales and maintenance
645,000 new cars sold
611 new car dealerships were open. That's nearly double the national average of dealerships per state.
So what will it take to keep the state's auto industry moving in the right direction? Nash has some ideas.
“Michigan and the states can't do much more than they've done,” Nash said. “We have to have pro-growth tax reform at the national level.”
Nash believes President Donald Trump has to find a way to get Congress to pass business-friendly tax reform. If not, Michigan's smooth ride to economic recovery could hit a few speed bumps.
“If we can't get that I would suggest that the economic recovery that we are in instead of speeding up with tax reform, we'll begin to decline,” Nash said. “And that will be bad for the auto industry and that will be bad for the state of Michigan.”

JONES MILLS, Pa. (AP)  A Pennsylvania man says he used flashing dashboard lights to mimic a police speed trap  but only so he could slow down vehicles speeding past his rural home and killing deer and endangering people.
Fifty-seven-year-old Ricky McMillen tells WPXI-TV (http://bit.ly/2z3i8zF ) that he used the flashing lights on his car because he's been complaining about speeders for years and getting few results. What he says he has gotten is very smelly deer carcasses along the road in Donegal Township, about 50 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
State police charged McMillen on Thursday with impersonating a public servant and displaying improper lights.
McMillen says he's been using the lights for a while and they've worked well.

McMillen has been mailed a summons to appear for a preliminary hearing Dec. 15.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Saturday claimed complete vindication from a congressional memo that alleges the FBI abused its surveillance powers during the investigation into his campaign's possible Russia ties. But the memo also includes revelations that might complicate efforts by Trump and his allies to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry.
The four-page document released Friday contends that the FBI, when it applied for a surveillance warrant on a onetime Trump campaign associate, relied excessively on an ex-British spy whose opposition research was funded by Democrats. At the same time, the memo confirms that the investigation into potential Trump links to Russia actually began several months earlier, and was “triggered” by information involving a different campaign aide.
Christopher Steele, the former spy who compiled the allegations, acknowledged having strong anti-Trump sentiments. But he also was a “longtime FBI source” with a credible track record, according to the memo from the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and his staff.
The warrant authorizing the FBI to monitor the communications of former campaign adviser Carter Page was not a one-time request, but was approved by a judge on four occasions, the memo says, and even signed off on by the second-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rod Rosenstein, whom Trump appointed as deputy attorney general.
Trump, however, tweeted from Florida, where he was spending the weekend, that the memo puts him in the clear.
“This memo totally vindicates ‘Trump' in probe,” he said. “But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their (sic) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!”
The underlying materials that served as the basis for the warrant application were not made public in the memo. As a result, the document only further intensified a partisan battle over how to interpret the actions of the FBI and Justice Department during the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation that Mueller later inherited. Even as Democrats described it as inaccurate, some Republicans quickly cited the memo — released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department — in their arguments that Mueller's investigation is politically tainted.
A closer read presents a far more nuanced picture.
“Having decided to cherry-pick, the Nunes team picked a bunch of the wrong cherries for its own narrative,” Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor and former Bush administration official, wrote in an email.
The memo's central allegation is that agents and prosecutors, in applying in October 2016 to monitor Page's communications, failed to tell a judge that the opposition research that provided grounds for the FBI's suspicion received funding from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Page had stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of that summer.
Steele's research, according to the memo, “formed an essential part” of the warrant application. But it's unclear how much or what information Steele collected made it into the application, or how much has been corroborated. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, a firm initially hired by the conservative Washington Free Beacon to do opposition research on Trump. Steele didn't begin work on the project until after Democratic groups took over the funding.
Republicans say a judge should have known that “political actors” were involved in allegations that led the Justice Department to believe Page might be an agent of a foreign power — an accusation he has consistently and strenuously denied.
The FBI this week expressed “grave concerns” about the memo and called it inaccurate and incomplete. Democrats said it was a set of cherry-picked claims aimed at smearing law enforcement and that releasing the memo would damage law enforcement and intelligence work.
For one, Democrats said it was misleading and incorrect to say a judge was not told of the potential political motivations of the people paying for Steele's research.
Beyond that, though, the memo confirms the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began in July 2016, months before the surveillance warrant was sought, and was “triggered” by information concerning campaign aide George Papadopoulos. He pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI.
The confirmation about Papadopoulos is “the most important fact disclosed in this otherwise shoddy memo,” California Rep. Adam Schiff, the House committee's top Democrat, said in a tweet Saturday in response to Trump's assertion that the document vindicated him.
The timing makes clear that other Trump associates beyond Page, who was part of the election effort for only a short period and was not in Trump's inner circle, had generated law enforcement scrutiny. The memo also omits that Page had been on the FBI's radar a few years earlier than part of a separate counterintelligence investigation into Russian influence.
The memo focuses on Page, but Democrats on the House committee said “this ignores the inconvenient fact that the investigation did not begin with, or arise from Christopher Steele or the dossier, and that the investigation would persist on the basis of wholly independent evidence had Christopher Steele never entered the picture.”
Other details in the memo could also challenge Republican claims of bias. The warrant requested was renewed on three additional occasions, meaning that judges approved it four times.
The memo had been classified because it deals with warrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The White House declassified it Friday and sent it to Nunes for immediate release.
That disclosure is extraordinary because it involves details about surveillance of Americans, national security information the government regards as among its most highly classified. The release is likely to further escalate the conflict between the White House and Trump's law enforcement leaders. Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray had personally lobbied against the memo's disclosure, arguing it could set a dangerous precedent.
The memo's release also comes amid an effort by Trump and congressional Republicans to discredit Mueller's investigation. His probe focuses not only on whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia but also on whether the president sought to obstruct justice.

Aneela Afzali was born in Kabul, Afghanistan. One day, when she was walking down the boardwalk along Alki Beach, somebody driving by opened their window and shouted obscenities and told her to “go home.” Her home, incidentally, was less than a mile away.
Afzali told this story and others like it to community members gathered for a panel discussion on Saturday in the Nisei Veterans Committee Memorial Hall. The event was called “Facing Prejudice, Past and Present,” and challenged both panelists and those in the audience to see what parallels can be drawn between the experiences of Muslim Americans today and those of Japanese Americans before, during and after World War II.
Afzali, whose family immigrated to the United States and who grew up near Portland, Oregon, is the founder and Executive Director of the American Muslim Empowerment Network, or AMEN, an initiative launched through the Muslim Association of Puget Sounds, or MAPS.
Afzali was joined by five other panelists: Joseph Lachman, presidentelect of the Seattle Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League and the donor relations specialist for the Council on American Islamic Relations; Kim Muromoto, a Nisei Japanese American who was incarcerated in the Minidoka Concentration Camp and drafted into the famed 442nd segregated infantry; Diane Narasaki, who has served as the Executive Director of Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS) since 1995; and Rasul Pasha, a convert to Islam and an activist in issues regarding the Muslim faith.
During the event, panelists took turns answering questions about their own personal thoughts and recollections concerning historical events like the bombing of Pearl Harbor or 9/11, along with the implications of those events and how we see them playing out today.
“Growing up, nobody knew where Afghanistan was. None of them would get anywhere close to finding it on a map. 911 changed all of that,” Afzali said. “People learned where Afghanistan was for all the wrong reasons.”
Afzali described what it was like watching the news on September 11, 2001 in her Harvard Law School dorm room. She felt fear and disbelief, and even began to cry. She was shocked and hurt by the atrocity that had been dealt her country. But, at the same time, she said, she had that feeling in the pit of her stomach, that feeling only people of color know, that anytime anybody in your community does something bad, it reflects on everybody.
“The good does not seem to reflect the same way,” she added.
In years to come, she said, antiMuslim sentiment has only grown. Referring back to her story about what happened near her home in Alki, Afzali explained that she was most afraid for Muslim youth.
“I can take it. I'm an adult. I recognize what's going on. but the impact on kids is heartbreaking,” she said. “The kind of long-term damage that can have, and the emotional trauma that it can create in people, is really something that we should all be worried about.”
Afzali believes that overcoming racial or religious barriers and recognizing the parallels in the experiences of minority communities is the best way to protect our rights and freedoms. She concluded her statement with an age-old saying: “if we don't remember the lessons of history, we are bound to repeat them.”

ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's Kurds will maintain their plan to hold a referendum on independence on Sept. 25, despite a U.S. request to postpone it, a high-ranking Kurdish official told Reuters on Saturday.
"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change," said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, commenting on the request communicated by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
The U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from "more urgent priorities" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.
A team of impetuous 20-something-year-old startup founders may not automatically reach out to the AARP to bring its products to market. Ignoring the aging population isn't the sharpest move, however. With its Innovation Champion Award, AARP wants to highlight that those over 50 have sacks of disposable cash and aren't afraid to spend it — as long as the value is there.
“Historically, people would retire at 65 and then have another 10 years to live or so,” says Anne Marie Kilgallon, vice president of Enterprise Strategy and Innovation for the AARP. “But things have changed a lot since then. These days, people live into their 90s, and these ‘bonus years' are important.”
Ageism is a real thing, and it swings both ways. Remember, oh, about 100 words ago, when I flippantly referred to startup founders as 20-year-olds? You probably didn't even notice, because that sort of thing happens all the time. “Young people are selfish and impulsive” and “old people hate technology” are truisms that hold true less and less often. This is one fight AARP is picking with its Disrupt Aging campaign — and a part of that is its new Innovation Champion Award.
“AARP is really committed to this caregiving space, and we want to be one of the voices that drives innovation to this space,” Kilgallon tells me. “That's what we do as a social advocacy organization. But the realistic truth of the matter is that we can only relieve the burdens placed on caregivers by embracing technology.”
For most businesses, $10,000 is a nice chunk of change, but for the most successful of businesses isn't going to move the needle. AARP knows that, but for them, it's more of a $10,000 spotlight pointing at an enormous opportunity than the cash incentive in and of itself.
“Research shows that 70 percent of U.S. disposable income is controlled by an aging population,” Kilgallon explains, “so there are tremendous business opportunities here. We just want to help companies find those opportunities and help solve some of our key challenges in the process.”
The key challenges are reflected in the company's awards categories, which are daily essential activities, caregiver quality of life, health and safety awareness, care coordination, social well-being and transition support. The companies up for awards will be judged on a number of criteria, not least of which is whether the businesses are viable.
“We love technology,” Kilgallon says, but stresses that her organization isn't pushing tech for tech's sake. “Winning technology needs to be affordable. It needs to have a business model that makes it viable. And it needs to be extremely well-designed. Gone are the days where the older generation eschewed all technology, but that doesn't mean the tools and services shouldn't be well-designed and easy to use.”
If the $10,000 doesn't get your business senses a-tingling, the grand prize probably should: It includes traveling to Washington, DC to speak with top AARP executives about your business. A golden opportunity, of course, for a company that could benefit from AARP's amplification.
“AARP is a social impact organization,” Kilgallon explains when I push her on what's in it for them. “What's in it for us is that we want to shine a light on the incredible innovation that is happening in products and services. We hope that the winners solve real, concrete problems experienced by people aged 50 and older.”
While there are fewer companies actively marketing to the silver economy, there are a few that do, and that do it well.
“I have been keeping an eye on Honor. The way the company has rolled out is really interesting, and it's a great model for how to connect care-givers to individuals in need of care,” Kilgallon says. “Caring Village is another startup worth looking at. They are all about the connection between family, care givers and care recipients.”
Nominations for the innovation champion award open today.
Two years ago, Google launched universal app campaigns (UAC) to make it easier for developers to easily promote their iOS and Android apps across its various platforms. Instead of having to set up separate campaigns for Search and Google Play, for example, developers can simply use UAC with a few lines of text, images and their bid and the service then handles the rest, based on what the developers want to optimize their campaigns for (installs or in-app conversions, for example).
This has turned out to be such an effective service — thanks in large part to the company's advances in machine learning — that Google is moving all app install campaigns to UAC over the rest of this year. Starting October 16th, all new app install campaigns created in Google Ads will run on UAC, and starting November 15th, all existing Search, Display and YouTube app promo campaigns will stop running.
Google tells us that it has delivered more than 6 billion installations to developers so far. That's a big increase over the last stats it offered in 2016. At that time, Google said it had delivered 2 billion installations. The company also told us that UAC already delivers more than 50 percent of all app downloads from ads today and that the machine learning algorithms that power the service analyze more than 300 million potential signal combinations in real time. That means the service looks at signals like where people are looking at an ad, for example, and what they are likely trying to do.
What's most important, though, is that these campaigns perform very well. UACs drive 140 percent more conversions per dollar than the company's regular app campaigns. Given these numbers, it's no surprise that Google is doubling down on this campaign type.
One major advantage of UAC is that it allows developers to not just optimize for app installs but also for in-app engagement and lifetime value. For many developers, it's now less about getting low-value installs but to make sure that the users they get want to make a purchase, book a hotel room or subscribe to their service. Google argues that its algorithms know enough about potential users to allow it to automatically optimize when and where it shows a developer's ads to bring the right users to the app.
“Having entertained over 1 billion people to-date, at Zynga we're focused on creating games that are designed to entertain consumer audiences over the long-term while delivering strong operational efficiency,” Zynga's VP of User Acquisition Kimberly Corbett told me about her company's use of UACs. “As such, our User Acquisition strategy has evolved to focus on bringing in players who will become part of our forever franchises, including games like Zynga Poker and Words With Friends, which are 10 and 8 years old, respectively.”

Uma Thurman says she was attacked by Harvey Weinstein multiple times.
The 47-year-old actress worked with the now-disgraced movie producer many times during her career and she alleged that he made his first sexual advance towards her in a Parisian hotel room, before attacking her in London.
She told the New York Times: "It was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not his track."
Uma told the publication that she later confronted Harvey in a hotel about the encounter, leading to an incident which she cannot fully remember.
Her friend, make-up artist Ilona Herman, recalled that Uma came downstairs after meeting Harvey in his room and was "totally out of control".
Ilona said: "She was very disheveled and so upset and had this blank look. Her eyes were crazy and she was totally out of control. I shoveled her into the taxi and we went home to my house. She was really shaking."
Uma also accused Quentin Tarantino of failing to protect her from a car accident during the filming of 'Kill Bill', after he insisted she perform a stunt driving sequence she was uncomfortable with.
Speaking about crashing the car, she said: "The steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me. I felt this searing pain and thought, 'Oh my God, I'm never going to walk again'. When I came back from the hospital in a neck brace with my knees damaged and a large massive egg on my head and a concussion, I wanted to see the car and I was very upset. Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused him of trying to kill me. And he was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because he didn't feel he had tried to kill me."
Pranoy's death triggered a series of student strikes across several campuses in Kerala, primarily demanding a change to some stifling rules imposed by private college managements. One of those strikes at the Kerala Law Academy in the state capital ended with the removal of its principal, Lakshmi Nair from her post and the demolition of the college gate by government authorities, pointing out that the gate was illegally constructed on government-owned land.

Idaho may be synonymous with potatoes, but the state is also one of the largest dairy producers in the country. Like much of the agriculture sector, a majority of the labor at dairies comes from foreign-born workers.
Click 'play' to hear the audio version of this story.
In southern Idaho, cows' hooves clack gently as they stand in the milking parlor of a small dairy. Taking the noise of the automated milkers in stride, the cows are calm as they're milked in 10-minute sessions. Monitoring the animals, overseeing the machinery and wrangling the cows in and out of the milking parlor is Pedro.
He came to the U.S. from Mexico 20 years ago. As he watches the livestock, he says in Spanish through a translator that his day usually starts at 3 a.m.
He's quite a sight. “My sweatshirt is torn; I'm all dirty from cow poop,” he says, spreading his arms and showing a streaky mess on his faded white hoodie. “My pants are wet, but this is all part of my job.”
Following a stint in Phoenix, Arizona, Pedro found his way to Idaho and got a job in the dairy industry. It's hard work, but Pedro says he likes it. This isn't his first job working with animals; before the dairy he worked on a cattle ranch.
While a job on a dairy may suit Pedro, he thinks the labor side of the agriculture sector is work most Americans wouldn't even consider.
“I don't believe the people who were born here want to work in the fields,” he says. He's seen a few Americans try the work, but based on his observations they usually only last an hour or half a shift before calling it quits.
The owner of the dairy where Pedro works doesn't sugarcoat the demanding nature of the jobs both she and her employees perform.
“Milking happens 365 days a year, seven days a week, whether it's windy or rainy or cold,” she says.
Like many dairy operations across the state, even this smaller one relies on labor from undocumented immigrants to get the daily tasks of feeding, milking and breeding the cows completed. As she's operating in violation of the law, she'll be referred by a pseudonym: Sherri.
Sherri says the trend of outsourcing undesirable jobs is nothing new.
“In America we've always had jobs that Americans aren't willing to do. We've always needed an immigrant workforce to do those kinds of jobs.”
Located in a rural part of southern Idaho, President Trump's fiery campaign rhetoric resonated throughout the region where Sherri's dairy is located. Many counties in the vicinity voted for the GOP by margins north of 70 percent. With Trump's determination to secure the U.S. border with Mexico, many undocumented dairy workers living in the shadows are afraid.
Pedro married an American in 2010 and only received his documentation a couple years ago. His brother Juan, who works with him on the dairy, is still without papers.
Standing by a pen filled with cows chewing cud and loudly mooing, Juan states the undocumented have always lived in fear.
“But now,” he says through an interpreter, “they're trying to categorize us as drug dealers, rapists – in other words, criminals. We're here working pretty much every day making an honest living.”
As bombast casts suspicion on all immigrants, Juan says authorities know where the actual criminal elements are.
At 31, Juan has spent over a third of his life in the U.S. He crossed into California over a decade ago and began working in landscaping there. Eventually, he headed north to Idaho to join his brother Pedro.
Like any regular job, Juan had to fill out an application to work on the dairy – an application that required he makes up a few of the numbers his employer asked for.
“If they wanted to check [workers'] status, it would make a difference, but since we're talking about agriculture work, work that really nobody wants to do, [employers] are willing to look the other way and not risk not having any employees,” Juan says.
Employment forms ask for things like residency status or social security numbers, and workers fill those sections in. Whether or not it's true isn't a concern of dairy owners.
Sitting at her kitchen table eating sandwiches and drinking coffee with a splash of fresh milk in it, Juan's boss Sherri says she takes the information provided to her by the employees of her dairy at face value.
“Because they are the people that are willing to do the job and they do the job well – and there is no legal system to hire somebody year round – it is pretty well accepted,” she says. “It's part of the system that nobody wants to talk about but we all participate in.”
There is one visa program specifically designed for foreign-born agriculture workers, but the H2-A visa only lets those guest workers stay in the country two to 10 months. That's no good for the dairy industry, which is a year-round operation.
The head of the Idaho Dairymen's Association, Bob Naerebout, says the dairy sector makes up a third of the agriculture industry in Idaho. It contributes $3.5 billion to the state's GDP. According to Naerebout, Idaho is the fourth- biggest dairy producer.
“The rural economy of Idaho, so the economy of Magic Valley and basically the rural economy across the state, is dependent on foreign-born labor,” he says. “For those in agriculture that aren't seasonal and temporary, we don't have a visa program.”
With the head of one of the largest industry groups in Idaho admitting dairy owners have few choices when it comes to employment, options are limited for owners of small dairies like Sherri or larger operations.
Sherri isn't looking for amnesty for her employees. Of a possible visa system, she says: “it doesn't have to lead to a path to citizenship. I think people should have that opportunity, but, at this point, if there was a legal year-round visa system, we would participate in it for sure.”
Her undocumented employees say they also wish there was a legal system in place for them to stay and fill the jobs native-born citizens won't do.
As he continues to live and work in the shadows without papers, Juan says he doesn't really have a plan should he get caught in an immigration raid.
“The only thing is that my wife is a citizen, and she would be able to stay here with the children,” he says. “But they're going to suffer as well. The only reality that I have is that I'm here undocumented.”
Juan's situation isn't uncommon, and the specter of deportation facing him is shared by millions of undocumented workers nationwide. With directives from the Trump Administration broadening the spectrum of who's made a priority case for removal from the country, the safest place for those doing the dirtiest and hardest jobs remains out of sight.

WINDOW ROCK – On Wednesday, Oct. 4, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA) notified the Office of President and Vice President (OPVP) about an emergency situation regarding an exposed gas line that feeds into Chinle.
“The serious nature of this situation warranted immediate resolve,” President Russell Begaye said. “OPVP was glad to assist and divert a situation that could have negatively impacted our communities and people.”
The line was critically affected but was addressed rapidly by OPVP, the Navajo Land Department and the Navajo Department of Justice.
Upon notification, OPVP staff responded immediately and
an Emergency Management Commission meeting was called. Within hours, NTUA was cleared for approval to begin repairs.
If neglected, the exposed gas line could have resulted in a large fire. It could have also left Chinle without natural gas.
“Navajo Nation government reacted immediately and took action,” said Rex Kontz, deputy general manager for NTUA. “Not like traditional government that is slow and has lengthy red tape. I am honored to work with true leaders.”
“The Office would like to thank all those who came together to address this exposed gas line and those who took action to resolve the situation. By working together, we were able to avoid a serious incident,” Vice President Jonathan Nez said.
The situation is being closely monitored by OPVP and updates will be provided as they are made available.
WASHINGTON – If it's a holiday, it must be time for President Donald Trump to hit the golf course.
Right on schedule, the presidential motorcade arrived at the Trump National Golf Club in suburban Virginia in the late morning, the middle of a day that also has the president tweeting and hosting a military-themed picnic later at the White House.
As he departed the presidential mansion in the morning, Trump took to Twitter.
In addition to a general salutation – "Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!" – Trump also tweeted out a video in which he salutes the authors of the Declaration of Independence and the American solders who won the revolutionary war against Great Britain.
Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2018
Trump also saluted current members of the U.S. armed forces – "truly special people" – saying "we are in awe of their courage, and we are eternally in their debt."
Later in the day, the president and first lady Melania Trump will host a July Fourth picnic for military families at the White House.
The Trumps and their guests will watch fireworks from the South Lawn.

(Reuters) - Male rats exposed to very high levels of the kind of radiation emitted by cellphones developed tumours in the tissues around their hearts, according to a draft report by U.S. government researchers on the potential health risks of the devices.
Female rats and mice exposed in the same way did not develop tumours, according to the preliminary report from the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP), a part of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
The findings add to years of research meant to help settle the debate over whether cellphone radiation is harmful.
Although intriguing, the findings can not be extrapolated to humans, NTP scientists and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Friday. They noted that the animal studies were meant to test extreme exposures to cell phone radiation, and that current safety limits on cellphone radiation are protective.
However, the two 10-year, $25 million studies - the most comprehensive assessments of health effects and exposure to radiofrequency radiation in rats and mice to date - do raise new questions about exposure to the ubiquitous devices.
In the studies, about 6 percent of male rats whose entire bodies were exposed to the highest level of cell phone radiation developed schwannomas - a rare type of tumour - in nerve tissue near their hearts, while there were no schwannomas in animals that were not exposed to radiation.
“The intriguing part of this is the kind of tumours we saw were similar to tumours noted for quite some time in some epidemiological studies in heavy-duty cellphone users,” John Bucher, a senior scientist with NTP, said in a telephone interview.
“Of course, these were in the nerves in the ear and next to the brain, but the tumour types were the same as we saw in the heart.”
Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, noted that the studies were negative for common tumours.
“These draft reports are bound to create a lot of concern, but in fact they won't change what I tell people: the evidence for an association between cellphones and cancer is weak, and so far, we have not seen a higher cancer risk in people,” he said in a statement on Twitter.
Brawley said if cellphone users are concerned about this data in animals they should wear an earpiece.
Unlike ionizing radiation such as that from gamma rays, radon and X-rays, which can break chemical bonds in the body and are known to cause cancer, radiofrequency devices such as cellphones and microwaves emit radiofrequency energy, a form of non-ionizing radiation.
The concern with this type of radiation is that it produces energy in the form of heat, and frequent exposure against the skin could alter brain cell activity, as some studies have suggested.
In the NTP study, rats and mice were exposed to higher levels of radiation for longer periods of time than what people experience with even the highest level of cellphone use, and their entire bodies were exposed all at once, according to the draft report.
Bucher said the effect likely only showed up in the male rats because they were larger, and likely absorbed more radiation than the female rats or mice.
Cellphones typically emit lower levels of radiation than maximum levels allowed, the draft report said.
Cellphone radiation quickly dissipates, so the risk, if any, would be to areas of the body in close proximity to the device emitting the radiation, Bucher said.
He said the findings are intended to help inform the design of future cell phone technologies. The study looked at only 2G and 3G frequencies, which are still commonly used for phone calls. It does not apply to 4G or 5G, which use different frequencies and modulation, he said.
NTP, a part of the National Institutes of Health, will hold an external expert review of its findings on March 26-28.
Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, head of the FDA's radiological health division, said there is not enough evidence to say cellphone use poses health risks to people.
“Even with frequent daily use by the vast majority of adults, we have not seen an increase in events like brain tumours,” he said in a statement. “We believe the current safety limits for cellphones are acceptable for protecting the public health.”
Asked what the public should take from the study, Bucher said, “I wouldn't change my behaviour based on these studies, and I haven‘t.”
Nevertheless, the findings are potentially a concern for device makers, especially the world's three biggest smartphone sellers, Apple Inc, Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and China's Huawei Technologies.
The CTIA, the trade association representing AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, Apple Inc, Sprint Corp, DISH Network Corp, and others, said on Friday that previous studies have shown cellphone RF energy emissions have no known heath risks.
”We understand that the NTP draft reports for its mice and rat studies will be put out for comment and peer review so that their significance can be assessed,” the group said.
Samsung and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sean Justice/Getty Images High demand and low interest rates drove housing sales in 2016, and 2017 is shaping up to be another good year, albeit with a few minor caveats. While home prices for starter-to-midrange homes are pushing upward toward pre-recession peaks, especially in secondary markets, they're stabilizing in higher-priced areas. Prognosticators see the robust markets of Seattle, Portland and Denver as 2017's top performers, with 10 percent to 11 percent price growth. If mortgage rates rise modestly as expected in 2017, sales elsewhere may normalize with smaller price appreciation, especially as housing starts rise to fill the inventory breach. But it sure looks like another seller's market again in 2017, and likely in 2018, with a few localized exceptions such as the overwrought Atlantic City, New Jersey and Detroit urban markets. As we march into the latter part of the decade, homeownership remains a practical long-term hold and self-enforced savings plan. Here are 10 tips to adapt to the latest market conditions.
1. First-time homebuyers: Get that starter home now
Well, you'd best gyrate into action. And we mean now! More than half of the home sales (52 percent) in 2017 are expected to be to first-time buyers, and mostly to the millennial set (19 to 34 years old), many moving from urban rentals, research by the National Association of Realtors shows. That means competition -- and bidding wars -- could become fierce in the spring for such "starters" in desirable areas.
While there'll be less inventory this winter, there'll also be less competition per unit and a higher percent of motivated sellers.

2. Sellers: Hire the right agent
Oftentimes, the best investment a seller can make is time spent researching agents. A bad hire can cost sellers tens of thousands of dollars and months of worried waiting.
First, look at an agent's' online marketing material and listings. Is there good photography or video? Does it "pop"? Are descriptions accurate and complimentary without seeming exaggerated?
Then, look at profiles of the agents on LinkedIn, Facebook and other social media; and be sure to read web reviews. What kind of vibe is an agent sending out?
Narrow your search to three agents and interview each, ideally in person. Ask for sales-activity reports, existing listings and time-on-the-market averages, plus the requisite local comps.
A seasoned listing agent also will know the best times for open houses and how to initiate a price war if the market allows. Never consent to a listing contract of longer than 90 days in a seller's market. You can always extend.
3. Buyers: There's more loan money out there
Those who couldn't get mortgages during the downturn because they didn't have 20 percent to put down can find affordable financing again.
Borrowers with FICO scores as low as 690 are now getting conforming mortgage loans (those under $417,000).
One telling sign: About two-thirds of mortgage refinancing were getting approved in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to just one-half of those at the end of 2014.
However, borrowers without a 20 percent down payment will still likely pay private mortgage insurance, or PMI, until they hit the 20 percent to 25 percent equity mark.
The best rates go to those with 800-plus credit scores, though 750-plussers are getting virtually the same terms.
Unfortunately, those seductive interest-only loans are also on the menu again. Avoid them. They're affordable at first since you're not paying principal, but then years later, well … see the Great Recession of 2008.
4. Sellers: It may be a seller's market but …
Home sellers can do several simple things to enhance appearance, increase buyer interest and boost their home's profile:
Renew selectively: Instead of wholesale renovations from which sellers recoup maybe 60 percent on investment, do light makeovers everywhere, with an eye on the kitchen and bathrooms. They're far more cost-effective.
Instead of wholesale renovations from which sellers recoup maybe 60 percent on investment, do light makeovers everywhere, with an eye on the kitchen and bathrooms. They're far more cost-effective. Clean, clean and clean some more: It's hard for buyers to picture themselves living in a dirty house. Scrub floors, baths, kitchens, windows and walls, and be sure to clean, vacuum and deodorize rugs. This is simple but effective.
It's hard for buyers to picture themselves living in a dirty house. Scrub floors, baths, kitchens, windows and walls, and be sure to clean, vacuum and deodorize rugs. This is simple but effective. Depersonalize, declutter: Show the space, not the contents. Box up family photos, kids' school papers and excess art, and store bulky and worn furniture. Organize your closets to make them look half empty.
Show the space, not the contents. Box up family photos, kids' school papers and excess art, and store bulky and worn furniture. Organize your closets to make them look half empty. Illuminate: Think bright and cheery. Open drapes and add brighter light bulbs in dark areas. Repaint where needed but use neutral colors.
5. Renters: It might be time to buy
In many cases, rents are rising faster than home values, yet mortgage rates remain low. That, and the fact that renters now account for 37 percent of households (the highest level in 50 years), seem to indicate an imminent coming-out party for renters-turned-buyers, especially if they plan to stay put for five to 10 years after buying.
There are limitless buy-versus-rent calculators like Bankrate's calculator for renters to compare affordability. But no gauge accounts for human behavior, such as reluctance of renters to re-invest what they've saved from not paying property tax, insurance, upkeep, etc. Homebuying basically enforces that discipline.

6. If you're a buyer, don't believe the house is yours
Don't bank on a done deal or other verbal promises from listing agents until you sign a contract.
In heated markets across the country, sales agents are giving buyers false hope and using their offers to bid up the price for preferred buyers who they think can pay more and close faster. Have other homes in mind.
Strategies such as preapproval (versus prequalification), proof of funding, closing flexibility and the always-risky practice of waiving inspection and repair contingencies can help sway buyers.
For added clout, tell sellers you're willing to "escalate," or exceed all offers to a certain limit. Some agents even advise buyers to write so-called "love letters" to sellers, telling them how much the home will mean to their families.
7. Sellers: The grass is always greener ...
… in yards with a "sold" sign. Major presale upgrades typically aren't needed, but a little greening outdoors is a must.
Surveys show that strong curb appeal can increase prices by 10 percent or more. Greener grass, whether derived from new sod or fertilizer and water, is a must.
New shrubs, plantings and flowers also project a welcoming feel. Sellers typically enjoy a 100 percent return on the money they put into curb appeal.
Another form of green, sustainable landscaping has become a value-add for buyers. Native plants, native grasses and perennials that require less water and attention fill that bill.
Do some local research or ask your local home-and-garden pro for simple "greening" tips.

8. Sellers and buyers: Know the state of your market
A balanced housing market is defined as one with an average inventory of 6.5 months, according to Texas A&M University Real Estate Center research. When inventory remains below equilibrium, sellers enjoy more control over prices and terms, and the area becomes a seller's market.
When inventory lingers well above stasis, you have a buyer's market where sellers must get more serious about price reductions, credits and throw-ins. Of course, these averages don't necessarily reflect demand in certain desirable and undesirable submarkets.
Go to Realtor.org for such market home sales data by state or to a local agent, business journal and daily newspaper you can read online. In 2016, the U.S. housing inventory average was under five months.
9. Sellers: House going on sale in the spring?
Do some prep work now. First, grab your camera or smartphone and do an exterior autumn photo shoot, with the leaves changing colors.
It's a much better way to showcase your home than to wait until late winter when everything is still dead and brown and mucky. Also take some landscape shots after the first snow, ideally on a sunny day, to show how cozy your place looks in winter.
Take a preliminary inventory, too. Look through your attic, closets, basement and garage to see what stored items you'll want to keep, give away or sell in the spring. This will help you determine whether you'll need a storage unit when your home is on the market and if there are any problem areas that need repairs or attention.
It's also a good time to start discussing financing options with a local lender and interview prospective listing agents who also might provide additional preparation tips.
10. Buyers: Relocating near a waterfront?
You'd best consider weather and insurance realities. Major hurricanes and floods of the past dozen years, particularly Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, have pushed the National Flood Insurance Program into a $23 billion hole, forcing flood-insurance rates to spiral.
FEMA flood-map changes are aggressively expanding flood zones, especially along the East Coast and Gulf Coast, forcing hundreds of thousands of homeowners to buy flood insurance for the first time and others to pay thousands more annually.
Parts of Florida saw 20 percent increases in 2016 and will likely see similar hikes in 2017. Insurers also are imposing coverage caps so there's no guarantee you'll be made whole post-catastrophe.
Some home sellers and their agents are conveniently not disclosing these realities, so buyers will have to ask pointed questions and do their own research. Go to FEMA.gov for more info.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Booz Allen Hamilton said on Friday it won a $621 million federal contract to develop and implement cybersecurity tools across the U.S. government.
The contractor, which earns billions of dollars a year contracting with U.S. intelligence agencies, said it was selected for a six-year task order to support the Department of Homeland Security's program known as Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation, which includes cybersecurity support for cloud and mobile devices and incident response services.
Finally, the die is cast.
The Vice President of the Ghana Football Association has been relieved of his duties following an Executive Committee meeting held on Tuesday.
It's interesting that the decision has come now, weeks after Afriyie announced at his 50th birthday party that he intended to contest in the 2019 GFA polls.
In the intervening period, the media waited for the blessing of Kwesi Nyantakyi for his vice. It never came. Instead, a loud silence filled the void, highlighting the rumoured rift between the two.
This rift, which had started months before when Afriyie had described Nyantakyi as greedy following disagreements over financial matters, has ultimately proven to have grown into Tuesday's announcement.
Last year, Nyantakyi had also mentioned at one meeting, at least, that he wanted his deputy out because he suspected Afriyie of conniving with Nii Lante Vanderpuije, an avowed critic of the GFA boss.
But what will be the domino effect of Afriyie's sacking?
Battle lines drawn
Before now, the line in the sand between the two men had been blurred. Now it's not, and both know where there are on the political divide. Without a doubt, Afriyie will now be emboldened to go all out in his quest to wrestle power from the GFA boss.
Even though Afriyie has denied on several occasions that he was at loggerheads with Nyantakyi, the former's sacking has simply validated that rumour. This will pave way for the 50 year-old George, whose campaign team had already told Joy Sports that his plans for the future of Ghana football are ready.
But history is not on his side.
Fred Pappoe (sidelined in 2011), and Fred Crentsil (sidelined in 2015) are the two previous Vice Presidents who suddenly found themselves out of the position, and their subsequent career trajectories say a lot about Nyantakyi: he does not allow his former lieutenants to continue being influential in football circles.
But George has never been deterred by this, as he told Joy Sports following his announcement to contest.
“I think after serving on the Executive Committee for three terms and the role I have played in this current tenure, I have gained the experience needed as well as gone through the mill to and learnt enough to place me in a position to take over from my boss.”
“Irrespective of the numerous criticisms, I believe this administration under Nyantakyi has achieved a lot and I don't think anyone is better placed to continue and build on the achievement than my good self," he said at the time.
Clearly, he was not singing from the same hymn sheet as his boss.
Relationship at the Executive Committee level
The Executive Committee (ExCo) is the second most powerful decision making body of the Football Association, after the Emergency Committee.
And since Nyantakyi announced he will not seek re-election several times within the last year, some names have popped up as possible contenders. None of those names were as high-profile as Afriyie.
This resulted in quiet division amongst the Exco – with some pandering towards him, while others felt Nyantakyi was still the right man for the job.
This toxic atmosphere at the helm of power needed to be fumigated. Trust Nyantakyi to deal with it, and he started doing so two weeks ago, when the FA announced that Afriyie had been removed as head of the Black Stars Management Committee. This position was one Afriyie had held since 2014, as a reward for his loyalty to Nyantakyi.
His removal was a clear signal that his end was near, and he knew. Last month, Afriyie told Kumasi-based Oyerepa FM that he was ready "to leave this position...because it is not for my mother or my father's lineage. Position is not possession."
If anyone was in doubt about the internal disquiet, some of Afriyie's own colleagues on the Exco publicly shamed him. These included Western Regional Football Association chairman Kojo Yankah, and Winfred Osei, who has now (conveniently) taken Afriyie's place at head of the Black Stars Management Committee.
“There is nobody in the country that has more experience in football administration in Ghana than Kwesi Nyantakyi. He is the CAF Vice President and FIFA Council member,” Osei said, effectively throwing Afriyie under the bus.
It is now clear that the relationships within the Executive Committee are frayed.
Nyantakyi will seek re-election in 2019?
The big picture of all this politicking has been because nobody is sure if Nyantakyi will go for his fourth term.
The experienced administrator has been at the helm since late 2005. Despite three straight qualifications to the World Cup, football in Ghana has not been at all rosy. Of particular has been the alarming decline in the Ghana Premier League by all stakeholders, and the death of the FA Cup for many years - until its revival some seven years ago.
Though Nyantakyi himself maintains the league is one of the best organised on the continent, the calls for change have always come from the general public, and not the so-called 'football people'.
However, the sacking of his vice has finally emboldened opinions that to save his legacy, Nyantakyi will have to seek re-election. For the first time since 2005, the existence of enemies rallying for his downfall is a clear and present danger.
But Nyantakyi did not get this far by chance. He knows the game. He's played it since his mid-twenties, and he will not be easy to uproot.
As George Afriyie himself said about why he wanted the top job after denying it for years, “only a fool doesn't change his mind”.
We wait and see.

PORVORIM
Goa bowled well to restrict Chhattisgarh to 189 for five on the first day of their Ranji Trophy opening match at GCA Academy ground in Porvorim on Friday.
Winning the toss and electing to bat first, Chhattisgarh suffered early jolt when they lost their opening batsman S Gupta lbw to RR Singh on the third ball of the match.
With the score reading 0 for 1, next man Abhimanyu Chauhan met other opener Rishabh Tiwari, and the two began resurrecting the innings. However, a bit of a mix-up between the two resulted in the run-out of Chauhan who departed for 37, as the team's score read 72 for 2.
Goa's Darshan Misal, who was instrumental in the run-out of Chauhan, soon gave the visitors another jolt when he removed AN Khare for 9. With the team stuttering at 95 for 3, Ashutosh Singh joined Tiwari who looked rock-solid at the other end. However, Tiwari too failed to make the most of the start that he had got and became Darshan Misal's second victim. Tiwari made 45 before being dismissed caught by Sumiran Amonkar as Chhattisgarh reached 110 for 4.
With his team finding itself in some sort of bother, entered captain Mohammad Kaif and the former India batsman stitched a 23-run partnership with Ashutosh Singh before the latter departed for 6 as Chhatisgarh score read 123 for 5.
Wicketkeeper batsman Manoj Singh then joined his captain and made sure that no more damage was done. At the end of day's play, the team reached 189 for 5 with Kaif batting on 49, which he scored with the help 8 boundaries, and Manoj Singh batting on 31, having hit 3 fours.
For Goa, Darshan Misal was the most successful bowler with figures of 2 for 15 in 17 overs. RR Singh and Amit Yadav scalped one wicket each. Veteran spinner Shadab Jakati went wicketless in the 21 overs that he bowled and conceded 42 runs.
Due to cloudy weather only 76 overs play was possible on the first day.

Orlando, Fla. — Al Kaline told the story Sunday afternoon, hours before the news was released that former Tigers Alan Trammell and Jack Morris were selected for induction in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Kaline doesn't ask for autographs. He gives them out constantly, almost non-stop when he's in public. But he rarely, if ever, asks for one of somebody else. On Nov. 30, after the 25th anniversary dinner for Angel's Place in Detroit, he presented Trammell with a ball and a Sharpie pen.
“Sign it, Alan Trammell, Hall of Fame,” Kaline asked.
Trammell balked.
“I'm not in the Hall of Fame,” he said.
Kaline said, “You're gonna be.”
So, the first-ever Hall of Fame autograph Trammell signed was for Al Kaline. Not too shabby.
“The Hall of Fame, that's got a great ring to it,” Trammell said on Monday morning as he and Morris were formally introduced by the Hall of Fame Board of Directors. “But when I hear, ‘Alan Trammell, Hall of Fame,' it hasn't resonated yet, and I'm just speaking from the heart.”
Honored, humbled, and in awe, that's how Trammell was still feeling, even after having a full night to digest the news.
“I still again have a hard time saying that, ‘Hall of Fame, Alan Trammell,' but I guess I'd better get used to it,” he said. “But to be part of a dream team, you can't envision that. Young boy, all I wanted to do was become a Major League Baseball player. And now to become a Hall of Famer, it's really indescribable.”
If Trammell was still a bit shell-shocked by the news, Morris was overcome with emotion. One of the fiercest and feared competitors of his generation, his eyes welled with tears and his voice cracked and broke throughout the press conference.

“Jack had me choking up,” said Hall of Famer Robin Yount, who was on the 16-member Modern Era Committee that selected both Trammell and Morris. “Heck, I didn't know that guy existed. I don't know Jack very much and I didn't know him personally, but I know the guy I faced all those years and that wasn't the guy I remember.
“That wasn't the guy I remember on the mound snorting and sweating — that guy was out for blood trying to get you out. He has a soft side?”
Morris, like Trammell, had all but resigned himself to never getting the call to the Hall of Fame. After falling just short of the 75 percent needed to gain entry for 15 years, he'd gone through all the various stages of grief — disbelief, anger, bitterness and finally acceptance.
“After failing on the writers' ballot, reality sinks in,” he said. “For me, it was a wonderful learning time because I had to remind myself of how much I am grateful for without the Hall of Fame. And then you get this wonderful news from your peers, and it happens, and Tram and I are both having a tough time grasping that right now.
“For me, this is more for the people that were in my corner than it is for me, myself, right now. I think if I made it on the first ballot, I wouldn't have that same feeling. So I'm grateful for the time because it has taught me a lot.”
Trammell, who remains in the Tigers organization as a trusted and leaned-on special assistant to general manager Al Avila, had a very Tram-like story to tell of how he got the word of his selection.

He was on a flight to Orlando from San Diego. While others on his flight — Brad Ausmus, Bud Black, Trevor Hoffman, Bruce Bochy and others — were seated in first class or up front, Trammell was contentedly seated in the back of the plane.
“As long as I get an aisle seat, I'm fine,” he said.
He knew the call, if it came, would come between 5:15 and 5:45 p.m. With delays, the plane didn't land until around 5:50. So there he was, in the back of the plane, surrounded by rambunctious kids anxious to get to Disney World, when he got the call that he was at last going into the Hall of Fame.
“There were numerous kids and I wanted to be emotional and jump and down and do something, but I think it was a little bit out of place to do that,” he said. “So I had to kind of keep it in check a little bit. Say, really? Unbelievable
“And then it took a while to get off the plane.”
Still, he couldn't say anything about it until the announcement was made on MLB Network at 6:15 p.m. So he had to stall.
“I purposely waited, being that I was kind of towards the back of the plane,” Trammell said. “So I waited, and I kind of stalled for a few minutes, going to the restroom, getting down to baggage claim. Our bags had not come out.
“And I saw this group (Ausmus and company), and it was right at 6:15. And as I walked up, they were all looking, waiting for me. I gave them the thumbs up. Then we took a little team picture kind of there. That's how it happened for me.”
Classic.
Both Morris and Trammell choked up some when the topic turned to their manager, Sparky Anderson.
“He was my No. 1 mentor,” Trammell said. “Hall of Fame managers and any of the real good ones — they had the ability to push the right buttons. And it was tough love. It was an era, almost an extension of your parents — the discipline and structure that I believe in very strongly. And that's what he did.
“As young athletes, we thought we were good, and we thought we knew what we were doing. And little did we know, we didn't know squat. We really didn't.”
Trammell talked about how he was in awe of Anderson, at first. Coming over after managing the Big Red Machine teams in Cincinnati, he seemed larger than life to Trammell.
“I found out a lot more about him and played for him for 17 years,” Trammell said. “So we had a very special relationship. But it was tough early on, but he did it for a reason, and I am very thankful and appreciative that our lives crossed because without him, it wouldn't have been the same.
“I know he's looking. I know he's looking down on us smiling. But he was a good man, a very good man. And, again, I'm very thankful that I played for him for that many years.”
Being inducted into the Hall of Fame with his teammate, Trammell said, was beyond special. But in his dreams, it wasn't Morris who he went in with. He said often the true story-book ending would be to go into the Hall of Fame with double-play partner Lou Whitaker.
“People I'm sure have heard my story many times but I have a dream, and I'm entitled to my opinion,” Trammell said. “My dream is as a double-play combination. We did it longer than any duo in the history of the game. We're linked together, as we should be. He's a friend of mine. He was an excellent player.
“I'm hoping at some point that my dream comes true. It didn't happen that we would go in together this year. I'm going in with my other buddy Jack, and I'm grateful and honored, as we've said many times. But I'm hoping that someday there is some more talk and that it does happen for Lou. But that will never change our relationship. It will never change the fact that we're the longest running double-play combination in the history of baseball. It's got a good ring to it. Got a good ring to it.”

LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) - Malik Monk scored 24 points, helping No. 6 Kentucky beat Auburn 92-72 on Saturday for its fifth straight win.
The balanced Wildcats (15-2, 5-0 Southeastern Conference) shot 57 percent from the field and placed five players in double figures. Edrice "Bam" Adebayo had 15 points, and De'Aaron Fox finished with 13.
The physical matchup included 49 fouls between the two teams, with Fox fouling out with 7:23 remaining. Kentucky connected on just 17 of 32 free throws, compared to 5 for 15 at the line for Auburn.
T.J. Dunans led Auburn (11-6, 1-4) with 23 points, and Mustapha Heron had 11.

Less than half of those surveyed aren't insured for earthquakes and wildfires
An example of an emergency preparedness kit. (City of Victoria photo)
British Columbians have no one to blame but themselves for not being ready for an emergency, a survey commissioned by the provincial government suggests.
Fifty-four per cent of the more than 1,200 respondents said they have a draft emergency plan, according to results released Monday suggest, but only 13 per cent of them have actually completed one.
Emergency kits were also lacking around the province: Only four in 10 people have one in their car, and only three in 10 have one ready at home.
And there's no good reason why: most people cited “personal laziness” and “apathy.”
Most British Columbians had some emergency supplies, but key items were lacking.
Only 60 per cent had prepared at least four litres of water per person per day, and less than half had cash in small bills, a battery-powered or hand-crank radio, a whistle or a dust mask.
If the worst did happen, most people weren't prepared to rebuild, either.
Around half of people living in Metro Vancouver and on Vancouver Island were insured against earthquakes, and less than half of southern Interior and northern residents were covered for wildfires.
All around, most people admitted they didn't really understand how their insurance worked or what it covered.
A recap of NFL Week 17 in which the Raiders and Texans suffered injuries at the quarterback position, while the Chargers and 49ers decided to part ways with their head coaches. (1:52)
Now that the NFL regular season is over, the 2017 opponents for every team have been finalized. The dates and times of each game will be determined in the spring, when the full regular-season schedule is released.
Click the links after each team to view the full lists.
Arizona Cardinals: Neither the Cardinals' road nor home schedule will be easier than the other next season. It's 2016 playoff teams galore. Full list.
Atlanta Falcons: With a first-place finish in the NFC South, the Falcons will face the first-place teams in both the NFC East and NFC West: Dallas and Seattle. The latter is Atlanta's only extended trip. Full list.
Baltimore Ravens: The Ravens defense will be tested again next season with a 2017 slate featuring five of the league's top quarterbacks. Full list.
Buffalo Bills: The Bills have the misfortune of playing the AFC West next season, including a road matchup with one of the two division's 2016 playoff teams. Full list.
Carolina Panthers: The Panthers have the potential for some cold games with trips to Chicago, Detroit, New England and New York (Jets). Full list.
Chicago Bears: Strength of schedule is overrated. The Bears supposedly had one of the easiest 2016 schedules -- and they finished 3-13. On paper -- outside of the division -- Chicago's schedule appears palatable. Full list.
Cincinnati Bengals: On the surface, this looks like a much easier schedule than in 2016, when the Bengals faced six playoff teams. Next season won't be a walk in the park, however. Full list.
Cleveland Browns: Any team that stared down an 0-16 finish should consider any schedule tough. But overall, this is a Browns-friendly slate. Full list.
Dallas Cowboys: There hasn't been a repeat champion in the NFC East since 2003-04. And with seven games against 2016 playoff teams on the docket for Dallas next year, it could be a challenge for the Cowboys to break that trend. Full list.
Denver Broncos: It could be a season of transition for the Broncos, but the Super Bowl 50 champs will get five of their toughest opponents at home in Denver. Full list.
Detroit Lions: It's an intriguing lineup for the Lions, but one that is likely to be more difficult than the records of their opponents would indicate. Full list.
Green Bay Packers: For the second straight year, the Packers won't have to play west of the Central time zone, making their travel about as light as possible. Full list.
Houston Texans: The Texans might not be able to rely on divisional play for five or more wins next season as Andrew Luck is no longer Houston's only threat in the AFC South. Full list.
Indianapolis Colts: The Colts have missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons, but hope could be on the horizon with only four games vs. 2016 playoff teams -- two of which are against Houston. Full list.
Jacksonville Jaguars: The Jaguars -- who will have a new head coach -- could be facing as many as six new head coaches in 2017. Full list.
Kansas City Chiefs: The 2017 schedule will be no picnic for the Chiefs no matter how the games are ordered: They have eight games against 2016 playoff teams. Full list.
Los Angeles Rams: The Rams will lose a traditional home game for the second straight year by hosting Arizona from London. The 2017 schedule will be challenging but not as difficult as the one from 2016. Full list.
Miami Dolphins: This is not an easy schedule for Miami, which finished second in the AFC East. The Dolphins will get at least three tough games against the AFC West, one of the best divisions in the NFL. Full list.
Minnesota Vikings: The Vikings' schedule will include at least four games against playoff teams. It probably represents a step up in class after the Vikings faced the meager AFC South this season. Full list.
New England Patriots: The Patriots will be traveling to Denver for the third straight regular season, and they will also take on the Falcons and Panthers at home. Full list.
New Orleans Saints: The opponents aren't any more overwhelming than in any typical year, but the locations could make for a grueling travel schedule with a pair of potential cold-weather games and trips as far east as London and as far west as Los Angeles. Full list.
New York Giants: Get the frequent flier miles ready. The Giants will do a lot more traveling in 2017, making four trips to Denver and beyond. Full list.
New York Jets: The AFC West, one of the best divisions in the league, is on the docket for the Jets next season with a road trip to Oakland. Full list.
Oakland Raiders: Could another trip to Mexico City be on the horizon for the Raiders? Either way, it'll be a marquee home slate in 2017, with four 2016 playoff teams coming to the Bay Area. Full list.
Pittsburgh Steelers: The Steelers get a slight upgrade to the schedule in 2017, with only a few games that stand out as major challenges. Full list.
Philadelphia Eagles: The Eagles have been fortunate to log a limited number of air miles during the past two seasons, but that will change with three West Coast trips. Full list.
San Diego Chargers: The road schedule is tough for the Chargers, with five playoff teams and four games on the East Coast. But the home schedule has several winnable games. Full list.
San Francisco 49ers: The best news for San Francisco is the NFC West has lost some of its luster. And while the NFC East will provide a stiff test for the 49ers, they also get the AFC South. Full list.
Seattle Seahawks: Even though it's a first-place schedule, the 2017 slate doesn't appear all that daunting at first glance. Full list.
Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Tampa Bay will need some momentum heading into a 2017 schedule that features four 2016 MVP candidates. Full list.
Tennessee Titans: Next season looks manageable for the Titans, with only two opportunities for cold-weather games and at least four games against teams with new coaches. Full list.
Washington Redskins: Three home opponents with 10 wins in 2016, three others who were strong Super Bowl contenders and three West Coast trips -- three reasons Washington's 2017 schedule doesn't look easy. Full list.
The Seattle Seahawks signed kicker Blair Walsh to a one-year deal last week, and the details of his contract make it clear that Walsh will have to perform well to earn his spot on the 53-man roster.
The deal can net Walsh up to $1.1 million, but it contains no guaranteed money. Walsh is set to receive $800,000 in base salary in 2017 and can earn an additional $300,000 in bonuses.
The first bonus is for $150,000 and kicks in if Walsh is on the 53-man roster for the first game of the season.
Additionally, Walsh can earn $9,375 for each game he is on the 53-man roster.
This is a low-risk deal for the Seahawks. Steven Hauschka is scheduled to be a free agent, and the Walsh signing suggests that Seattle is preparing for Hauschka to sign elsewhere. But it does not mean that the Seahawks are sold on Walsh being their kicker in 2017.
They will almost certainly bring in a rookie kicker to compete with him in the spring. And if a rookie performs well, he will be a less expensive option than Walsh.
The Seahawks don't want to go into next season with a question mark at kicker, but Hauschka will likely want to be paid like a top-10 player at his position, and that could mean a salary of at least $3 million per year. They'll save money and cap space by going with Walsh or a rookie instead.
Walsh made the Pro Bowl in 2012 but struggled when the Minnesota Vikings played outdoors. In the wild-card round of the 2015 playoffs, he missed a potential game-winning field goal from 27 yards out against the Seahawks and was never able to bounce back last season. The Vikings released Walsh after he struggled through nine games.
The Seahawks will see if Walsh can find his footing this spring and summer. If he does, Walsh will be well-positioned to earn his money in 2017.

Erdoğan says attack sought to create chaos in Turkey
Istambul
An intense manhunt is underway in Turkey for a gunman who fired at a crowded Istanbul nightclub during its New Year's Eve celebrations early Sunday morning, killing at least 39 people and injuring at least another 65, said interior minister Suleyman Soylu.
Of the 39 deceased victims, five Turkish nationals have been identified so far. At least 15 foreigners were killed, but their nationalities have not yet been revealed.
Of the 69 people hospitalized, four are in critical condition and one is in very critical condition, Soylu said. The s
At a press conference Sunday, Soylu said the attack was carried out by only one individual. Soylu said the assailant arrived wearing a jacket and pants, and is believed to have left wearing different clothing. There were local reports that he wore a Santa Claus costume, but that has not been confirmed.
The attacker walked into Reina nightclub — a see-and-be-seen hotspot popular with foreigners — after midnight with a long-barreled weapon after killing a policeman and a civilian outside the venue and began spraying bullets, said Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin.
There were between 400 and 500 party-goers inside the nightclub at the time of the attack.
“Unfortunately (he) rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year's and have fun,” Sahin told reporters.
And Soylu described the attack as “as a cowardly terror attack that targeted civilians. It happened when people were renewing their hopes for the New Year. This terror attack targeted unprotected people.”
Soylu said authorities are aggressively searching for the gunman. “Our security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing he will be caught in a short period of time.”
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said in a statement Sunday, “I vehemently condemn the terror attack … Turkey continues its combat against terror and is absolutely determined to do whatever is necessary in the region to ensure its citizens safety and peace.”
“They are working to destroy our country's morale and create chaos by deliberately targeting our nation's peace and targeting civilians with these heinous attacks,” Erdoğan said in a statement on the presidency website.
The US was quick to condemn the attack.
“The President was briefed by his National Security Team on the attack in Istanbul,” President Barack Obama's principal deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said in a statement. “The President expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted.”
The US consulate in Istanbul tweeted, “Security operations still in progress. U.S. Citizens should shelter in place, limit movements & contact family & friends if you are fine.”
Russian president Vladimir Putin sent Erdoğan a telegram of condolences, according to the Kremlin, writing, “It is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than killing innocent people during New Year celebrations. However, terrorists don't share moral values. Our common duty is to combat terrorists' aggression,” Putin said.—Agencies

O'Mahony leads Lions against Maori All Blacks

By Greg Stutchbury
AUCKLAND (Reuters) - Irish flanker Peter O'Mahony will captain an experienced British and Irish Lions team for the match against the Maori All Blacks on Saturday but tour skipper Sam Warburton gets another chance to press his claim for a test spot from the bench.
Warburton arrived on tour under an injury cloud having not played since April due to a knee injury and only returned to action in the opening match against the Provincial Barbarians, a 13-7 victory.
The Welsh flanker scored a try in Tuesday's loss to the Otago Highlanders but will be hoping for plenty of gametime to impress in Rotorua on Saturday given the back row talent coach Warren Gatland has available to him.
Gatland was expected to select close to his first choice side for the fifth match of the tour with the first test against the All Blacks only a week away.
If that is the case, then the New Zealander will clearly be looking to dominate the hosts physically in midfield after naming Jonathan Davies and Ben Te'o in the centres.
Jonny Sexton also returned at flyhalf in an all-Irish combination with scrumhalf Connor Murray, while England's Owen Farrell will be on the bench.
The hulking George North and pacy Anthony Watson will occupy the wings with Leigh Halfpenny named at fullback, a position that might have been taken by Stuart Hogg had the Scot not been ruled out of the tour by injury on Tuesday.
In the pack, England duo George Kruis and Maro Itoje will make up the second row with their international teammate Jamie George getting the nod at hooker.
"At this stage of the tour it is important to build on the foundations that have been laid in the last few weeks," Gatland said in a news release.
"We were obviously disappointed with the loss against the Highlanders and realise that we need to improve in several areas, including our discipline, but we feel that overall we are building well towards the test matches.
"Every game is a big challenge, which is what we wanted, and this is an experienced Lions team with eight of the starting 15 involved in the last test in Australia in 2013."
O'Mahony will lead the team from to blindside of the scrum with his Irish teammate Sean O'Brien at openside and Welshman Taulupe Faletau in the number eight jersey.
"Peter is a proven captain with Munster who never takes a backward step and we believe that those leadership qualities will serve us well on Saturday against a quality and determined Maori All Blacks team," Gatland added.
Lions: 15-Leigh Halfpenny, 14-Anthony Watson, 13-Jonathan Davies, 12-Ben Te'o, 11-George North, 10-Johnny Sexton, 9-Conor Murray, 8-Taulupe Faletau, 7-Sean O'Brien, 6-Peter O'Mahony (captain), 5-George Kruis, 4-Maro Itoje, 3-Tadhg Furlong, 2-Jamie George, 1-Mako Vunipola.
Replacements: 16-Ken Owens, 17-Jack McGrath, 18-Kyle Sinckler, 19-Iain Henderson, 20-Sam Warburton, 21-Greig Laidlaw, 22-Owen Farrell, 23-Elliot Daly.

I am so deeply socially anxious that asking strangers questions or for directions sends me into a stomach-turning panic (which, come to think of it, is not a great quality for a journalist). For me, even making a dinner reservation is a struggle, and one of the reasons I've never bothered trying to apply to graduate school is that asking my old professors and/or bosses for a reference letter is harrowing, to say the least. But LinkedIn's new referral system is a godsend for people like me: it'll let you ask for referrals with just one click, so you don't have to send off a "Hi, don't know if you remember me, but..." email into the ether ever again.
As reported by Mashable, LinkedIn is rolling out a new "Ask for a Referral" feature, which will send your selected LinkedIn connections a referral request. Basically, when you see a job posting on LinkedIn, the website will show you which of your connections works at the company that posted the listing. That's already available systemwide, but with the new feature, an "Ask for a Referral" button will pop up next to the connection's profile, and if you click it, a pre-written request for a referral will generate. Press send, et voila — you've asked for a reference.
Note that it's a good idea to personalize the message a little, so the person you're asking to stick their neck out for you doesn't think they're doing a favor for a bot. But the referral feature does take some of the sting out of having to dig up someone's email and beg them to tell their boss nice things about you, plus it's an easy way to see who works at what company, so you know who to reach out to in the first place.
Of course, even if you are freaked out about asking someone for help with your job search, know that it's a totally accepted and welcome practice. People who work at jobs they love are always looking to add cool new coworkers who'll help brighten up the workplace and get thinkings working smoothly, and if you're taking the initiative to ask someone for a referral, or to reach out and ask off-the-record questions about the job/company culture, etc., you're already showing people you're excited and serious enough about the available gig.
It's also important to note that it's possible someone won't want to be your reference, but it's not personal if they reject you. When I was new at a job a few years ago, my company put out a hiring call and a few people I didn't know too well asked if I could recommend them. Since I had only just been hired myself, and wasn't totally familiar with the company's hiring practices or the people asking me for the referral, I gave the inquisitors some tips and names of people to contact, but told them I'd prefer they leave my name out, lest my bosses thought the new girl was overstepping her bounds. Later, when I was more comfortable at the company, I was much more liberal with my referrals.
Also, while the LinkedIn feature is super useful, you should still get in the practice of sending real emails and not LinkedIn messages. A lot of people don't check LinkedIn regularly, especially if they're not hiring managers or in the market for a new job. More importantly, an email does show that you've made the effort to look someone up and reach out, and the more personal a touch you make, the more likely someone will make the equal effort to reach back out. A job search is a symbiotic relationship, after all.
Nowadays, practically every credit card has an embedded chip that contains encrypted digital data about you.
They're designed to help safeguard your identity, but that same technology could leave you vulnerable to fraud.
Recently a Chicago man claims the chip on his card fell off. His bank told him he needed to get a new card with a new number since that chip could be used on another card.
Kelly Ueoka, president of Pacxa, a Hawaii company that specializes in information technology and data security, explains why.
“Hypothetically, they could forge that (chip) onto another card, go to the store and use it like their own. Although I would note that it is extremely difficult to do that,” he said.
Ueoka says losing the chip is the same as losing your credit card.
“It would need to be forged, meaning you would need to have a credit card, exact same shape and size of one, and be able to put that chip into that forged card, which it would take a professional to do that,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Hawaii Bankers Association says there have been no reports of chips falling off here in Hawaii, and instances of it happening are rare.
The Hawaii Better Business Bureau offers the following tips:
Pay close attention to the chip on your card.
If it's missing or looks damaged, report it to the card issuing agency immediately.
Avoid exposing your card to unnecessary wear and tear.
Always monitor your credit card and bank statements for any irregularities.
“We always tell consumers it pays to be vigilant when you're dealing with your credit cards, your personal information, anything like that, and that's what can lead to people getting a hold of your information,” said Jason Kama, Hawaii Better Business Bureau director of marketing.
Ueoka emphasizes that while this latest incident might have some questioning the new technology, he says it's significantly helped protect consumers from fraud.

Since starting my internship with All Classical Portland, I have been given every opportunity to learn new things about classical music, radio, and nonprofit organizations. In addition to learning new skills at ACP, my love of writing has never been overlooked here, and I have been able to write a handful of blogs for All Classical Portland's website thus combining two things I am passionate about: writing and music. As my time with ACP comes to an end, it's time for one last blog for the station, my “Swan Song”, if you will, which is exactly what my final blog post is about: the origin of the term Swan Song, as well as several famous swan song performances throughout history.
A swan song is a metaphor used to refer to a final gesture before retirement. The term originated in ancient Greek culture, and its first reference is found in Aeschylus' Agamemnon, which was written in 458 BC. The remark was made when Cassandra dies, “after singing her last death-laden lament like a swan.” Since then, it has been used frequently throughout literature from the works of Aesop to those of Tennyson.
It was rumored that swans live a silent existence until the time of their death, when, with their last breath, they would sing a beautiful song. Plato credited Socrates for remarking on the beautiful, finale song of the swan as being sung, “merrily.” It's a romantic notion, however, if you've ever met a swan, seen one in a park, witnessed a flock making its migratory trek, or been attacked by a protective mother swan while windsurfing, you may be well aware that the birds are anything but quiet. In fact, of all the adjectives used to describe their song, “beautiful” is probably one of the least likely to be employed.

A perfect example of a swan song in metaphorical context is Franz Schubert's Schwanengesang; literally translated into “Swan Song”, Schwanengesang is a collection of fourteen pieces based on the poetry of the German poet, Heinrich Heine. Schubert worked on the music just before he died, and it was published posthumously. The music itself expresses emotions full of joy, remorse, yearning, loss, and love, thus marking the end of the remarkable career of Franz Schubert.
One of the biggest operatic divas of the late 19th century was Australian soprano, Nellie Melba. Dame Nellie Melba demonstrated her own take on a swan song performance towards the end of her career when she announced her departure from grand opera in Australia in 1924. Her farewell tour lasted a healthy four-year period until 1928, when she moved to Europe and toured off and on again for the remainder of her life. Her lengthy farewell tour reflected her eccentric career, and inspired the Australian turn-of-phrase, “more farewells than Dame Nellie Melba.”
On January 8, 2016, David Bowie released his final album, Blackstar. Two days later, the celebrated rock star lost his battle with cancer and sent fans reeling. Immediately, the world recognized Blackstar for what it is: a farewell album. The album articulates Bowie's sincere gratitude towards his fans and reflects on his avant-garde career. Blackstar is both an unequivocal Rock & Roll swan song and a sincere parting gift.
This past April, the New York Times published an article titled, “The Diva Departs: Renée Fleming's Farewell to Opera.” This exaggerated title implied that Ms. Fleming was planning to retire from her extensive career, when, in truth, she was merely retiring from one of her many operatic roles, that of the Marschallin in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. Ms. Fleming made sure to correct the misunderstanding, and has assured numerous sources that she is not retiring from opera, merely exploring additional avenues. Reneé Fleming's Swan Song performance of Der Rosenkavalier in May did not signify her retirement; instead, it marked a shift in her career focus.
This article is not marking my retirement from writing by any means; however, it does mark my departure from All Classical Portland. This station has provided me with memories that I will always cherish, and experience that I will call on throughout future endeavors.

Pretoria - In a surprising twist in the matter involving Zimbabwean first lady Grace Mugabe, the country's embassy has decided to withdraw from the matter as an intervening party claiming its lawyer had received threats.
The lawyer representing the embassy, Simba Chitando, told the media that: "I have received instructions from consul general of the Zimbabwean embassy which reads: 'I have read the memorandum by Adv (Simba) Chitando our counsel of record and have personally seen various threats made against him while representing the Zimbabwean embassy.'
"The conducts of various individuals in this matter has made the Zimbabwean embassy and its future involvement in this matter undesirable.
"The Zimbabwean embassy, regardless of the outcome of the proceeding, shall no longer participate in these hearings,'' said Chitando on Friday.
Chitando, who did not clarify whether these were death threats, was responding to acting judge Harshila Koovertjie's short order - in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria - in the application on whether Mugabe should be served court papers at the Zimbabwean embassy in SA or in person in her home country.
Costs
Koovertjie said the matter should be referred to the opposed court. She said costs in this matter had been reserved.
AfriForum's Willie Spies said essentially, there was no order granted with regards to the arguments that were brought before the court on September 19.
He explained that the Zimbabwean embassy was granted seven days to file an affidavit confirming whether they represented Mugabe or not.
AfriForum will have seven days thereafter to respond to the embassy's affidavit, he said. The matter will then be argued at the opposed motion court.
Responding to the shocking news of the threats, Spies said it was "surprising".
"I have not heard of it [the threats]. That is absolute nonsense and I think that it is just an effort to taint the process and to put them in a position to attack the process later and I cannot believe that it is possible.
"Obviously, if it is true, then the matter needs to be investigated. But then I would like to see whether there were any criminal charges laid at the police station.
"The only criminal charge that was laid at the police was the criminal charge laid by [Gabriella] Engels against Grace Mugabe. That is the only criminal charge that was laid."
He explained that the embassy went to court on September 19 in an "absolute irregular fashion" to oppose an application that in normal course is not an opposed application.
"After they made this huge meal of the whole process, they come and announce today that they are withdrawing all of their efforts."
Delay tactics
Spies said to him, it looked like the embassy was using delay tactics.
"The mere involvement of the embassy from the onset was to frustrate and delay the process to ensure that justice is delayed. Fortunately now they have withdrawn which makes the process further, easier."
Spies said because the order was not granted yet, no one had received what they wanted.
"The matter was postponed for a hearing on the opposed motions roll..."
He said the process was not to "take on Grace Mugabe".
"The issue is to serve justice and to make sure that issues are brought before the court… and not [dealt with] by politicians in positions of power…
"The ultimate goal is to bring a review application, which is a civil proceeding, in order to set aside the immunity that was granted to Grace Mugabe so that criminal and civil proceedings can continue."
Mugabe was granted diplomatic immunity despite allegedly assaulting South African model, Gabriella Engels with an extension cord on August 13.
Mugabe reportedly denied that she assaulted Engels, 20, after she allegedly found her with one of her two sons, Chatunga Bellarmine, in a hotel room in Sandton. DM

The Atlanta Gladiators took a one-goal lead into the third period and held the Stingrays' offense quiet for the final frame to claim a 4-2 win in South Carolina's first preseason game of the 2017-18 season on Friday night at the Carolina Ice Palace.
Joe Devin scored twice in the first period for South Carolina, with both tallies coming on an assist by Tim McGauley. The Stingrays finished the exhibition contest a perfect 3-for-3 on the penalty kill.
Devin wasted no time putting the Rays in front, scoring in the opening minute. 37 seconds in McGauley found his captain with a pass through the slot and Devin beat goaltender Troy Passingham with a shot to the top left part of the net.
Atlanta evened things up at 1-1 on a goal by Patrick D'Amico with assists from Phil Lane and Eric Shand at 6:14 of the first.
Devin then got his second of the period less than a minute later at 6:48 to put South Carolina back in front 2-1. Once again it was McGauley who picked up the assist, his second of the evening.
The Gladiators scored with three minutes left in the opening frame to re-tie the contest at 2-2. Forward Thomas Frazee deflected a shot by Derek Nesbitt past Rays' netminder Carmine Guerriero to send the teams into the locker room with an even score.
Atlanta notched the only goal of the middle frame, with D'Amico finding the back of the net for a second time to give the Gladiators a 3-2 advantage at 3:12 of the second. The goal turned out to be the game-winner, as South Carolina was unable to muster any more offense later in the matchup.
The game remained a 3-2 contest until the final minute when South Carolina pulled Guerriero for an extra attacker. Atlanta's Nathan Todd sealed the win for his side with an empty net marker at 19:49.
South Carolina finished 0-for-1 on the power play in the game, while Atlanta was 0-for-3. The Gladiators led in shots on goal, 30-15.
Guerriero took the loss, making 26 saves, while Passingham stopped 13 shots to earn a victory.
The Stingrays are back in action Saturday night when they host the Greenville Swamp Rabbits at the Carolina Ice Palace in their final preseason contest at 7 p.m.
The Stingrays open their 25th anniversary season at the North Charleston Coliseum on Oct. 20 against Greenville at 7:05 p.m.

Secret Service Director Announces Retirement
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP
The director of the Secret Service is stepping down. Joseph Clancy informed his colleagues of his decision to retire, effective March 4, saying that "for personal reasons, it is time." Clancy, 61, says he wants to spend more time with his family.
Clancy was brought back to the Secret Service as director by former President Obama in 2014 after a string of security lapses and misconduct by agents and officers.
He had left the agency for a job in the private sector in 2011 after serving as the head of Obama's protective detail.
Obama asked Clancy to return to the service as acting director after then-Director Julia Pierson was asked to resign. Clancy took over an agency in turmoil, with reports of carousing agents and security breaches, the most embarrassing when an Iraq War veteran scaled the White House fence and made it into the White House itself before being stopped.
In his letter to Secret Service staff, Clancy said he can assure them that "better days are ahead for this Agency with new leadership at the Director's position" and that he could not be "more impressed, more grateful and more proud of all of you."
The Secret Service has some 7,000 employees and is charged with investigating counterfeiting as well as protecting the president, vice president, their families, former presidents and other dignitaries.
President Trump, who Clancy said has been "very supportive" of the agency, will be able to name a replacement.
Over the Thanksgiving holiday, I was one of the many Americans who took to the skies to visit loved ones. A good book can help ease the pain of flight delays and fortunately I had one.
It was titled Shoe Dog, which in essence tells the story of the founding of a Portland, Oregon shoe company originally called Blue Ribbon, and which we all know today as NIKE.
Phil Knight, one of NIKEs cofounders, wrote the book and I enjoyed it very much. He covered the trials and tribulations of trying to get his firm from a start-up company dependent for financing from his local bank to where it stands today.
He wrote of the frequent daily challenges, from dealing with overseas suppliers to juggling employee personalities and the near collapse of the firm when a Washington D.C. bureaucrat nearly closed him down.

Not only did I enjoy the ups and downs of his business decisions, I thought it was equally interesting to read how he struggled to find time to spend with his two young sons.
He built an extremely lucrative business, but his concern for family and friends and the wellbeing of his employees were clearly a part of his equation for success.
This isnt a book review; its a snapshot of whats going on all over America today. There are businesses everywhere trying to show a profit, treat their employees fairly and display good corporate citizenship. From my experience the challenge is daunting, but most small business owners remain undaunted.
While I was travelling, one of the hot news topics was tax reform. The twofold intent was to lower corporate tax rates to make them competitive with the rest of the world, and to provide tax relief and simplification for individual taxpayers.
These are reasonable objectives, but the comments I read on social media make me grimace. The divisiveness of our nation is quite disturbing and it amazes me that most discussions on the matter are rife with profanity.
I read tons of business publications and I have worked with
everything from mom-and-pop companies to Fortune 500 corporations. Guess what? Theyre not trying to scorch the environment and put it to all their employees.
Are there a few bad apples? Sure. But far from the majority. Likewise, the wealthy arent trying to further enrich themselves by putting it to people struggling to make ends meet. Many of the mega-wealthy are extremely generous. As an advisor, I have witnessed some very substantial gifts and donations that have not made it into the headlines.
For corporate America, high tax rates and the world of bureaucracy and complexity are simply hurdles to overcome, with or without any reform.
As for individuals, I wouldnt count on lower income taxes or any type of government program that will make your lives easier. At the end of the day, individual success is a result of disciplined saving and investing and spending prudently.
If by chance something gets done in our nations capital that puts more money in your pocket, think of it as an unexpected windfall and apply it toward your long-term goals. There are many other issues besides tax reform that need to be addressed by our nations leaders. Lets hope the discussions are civil.

A 36-year-old mother of three is donating two of her organs in order to save the life of her young son, telling him “This is going to be your year,” BBC News reports. Sarah Lamont will be donating one of her kidneys and a part of her liver in order to give her son the transplants he desperately needs. Ballymena mother Sarah Lamont gives four-year-old son Joe “gift of life” for Christmas: https://t.co/C6DNz5rVl6 pic.twitter.com/9P0nd2JX3H — BBC News NI (@BBCNewsNI) December 23, 2016 Lamont's four-year-old son, Joe, was born with a rare kidney condition known as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, which ­destroyed his kidney function at birth. His kidneys were so enlarged that they were the size of adult kidneys. They had to be removed to save his life because they were pressing on other vital organs. Doctors did not expect him to survive. Joe beat the odds and lived, but he has had an extremely difficult time. He has had a number of serious illnesses in his short life and he has been on the waiting list for combined liver and kidney transplants for two years. When there was still no sign that her son would be getting a call soon about organs being available, Sarah asked if she could donate both of the needed organs for her little boy. While it is relatively common for parents to donate organs to their children, no parent has ever given two organs. “They hadn't suggested it before because it hadn't been done before but in January I will donate part of my liver and a few months later my kidney,” Sarah said. Devoted mum Sarah Lamont just can't wait to give brave Joe a kidney and part of her liver' https://t.co/RywbXa0JNg — Allan Preston (@AllanPreston) January 2, 2017 The first of the operations will take place later this month at Birmingham Children's Hospital, where doctors have only carried out a procedure like this once before. The liver transplant will be the riskier one for Sarah, with a one in 250 risk of death. Removing a kidney for live donation leads to death in one in 4,000 cases, doctors say. Sarah says things have been very difficult for little Joe. He has been on kidney dialysis since birth but there is no machine that will do the job of the liver, she says. “He's had a really hard run,” she said. “His doctors have called him a miracle. He's like the cat with nine lives. “We've been told so many times ‘we can't do any more prepare for the worst'. The doting mother describes Joe as a “great, funny feisty wee boy”and says “he puts up with so much.” “I just want him to be a normal happy wee boy and have the opportunity to grow up and get a job and get married and have babies,” she said. Sarah says she's doing what any parent would do to save the life of their child. “If I can help him do that like any parent – you'd do anything for your child,” she said. He's fighting so hard to stay on this earth so I have to be his mummy and fight for him too. Sarah has two other children at home, Max, 12, and Eve, 10. She knows that she is putting herself at risk with the surgeries but says she would do the same for her older children. “I've had all the ­counseling about the risks, she said. “They are great surgeons and will do the best for me. But if anything goes wrong for me I know I will die knowing I saved my son.” Sarah is passionate about organ donation encourages people to find out the wishes of their loved ones so they can donate their organs if it is possible. “I would urge everybody to sit down and have a chat with their loved ones about what their wishes are,” she said. Doctors are planning to do the liver transplant on January 25, with the kidney operation in the following months when both mother and son have recovered.

South Korea's annual imports of automobiles topped $10 billion for the second consecutive year in 2016 despite lingering repercussions stemming from Volkswagen's emissions scandal, industry data showed Wednesday.
According to the data by the Korea International Trade Association, South Korea imported a total of $10.63 billion (about 12.1 trillion won) worth of foreign vehicles last year, but the reading marks a 1.4 percent dip from the previous year's $10.78 billion.
(Yonhap)
The country's foreign auto imports topped $1 billion in 2003 for the first time since the local automobile market of South Korea was open to foreign brands in 1987.Except for 2009, the imports of foreign vehicles have increased at an annual rate of between 5.3 percent and 44 percent in the past decades. In 2015, auto imports surged 18.3 percent on-year as well, the data showed.Due to Volkswagen's diesel gate, imports of foreign vehicles with a diesel engine of 2.5 liters or below dropped 19 percent on-year last year to $3.37 billion, marking the first on-year decline.Imports of cars with a diesel engine of 2.5 liters or above also sank 23.6 percent to $1.63 billion over the cited period, the data showed.Reeling from a sales ban here, Volkswagen saw its sales here plummet 63.2 percent to 13,178 units last year, with the sales of Audi cars also plunging 48.6 percent to 16,718 units over the cited period, they showed.Instead, other foreign automakers, such as BMW and Toyota, expanded their presence here last year.BMW's 520d was the best-selling model here among foreign brands last year with a total of 7,910 units sold, followed by Benz's E-300 with 6,169 units and Lexus's ES300h with 6,112, the data showed.

Centerfielder Estevan Florial went 3-for-3 with a double and twice scored on RBI knocks by designated hitter Angel Aguilar as the D.R. and Venezuelan duo combined to lead the Charleston RiverDogs past West Virginia, 5-2, in front of 3,787 on Wednesday night at Joe Riley Park.
Freicer Perez (2-3) turned in six strong innings of work, allowing just two runs on four hits as he collected his second win of the season. It was the Dominican Republic native's fifth consecutive outing turning in at least 5 2/3 frames as he lowered his ERA to 3.51 after fanning six and walking three.
All-Star outfielder Florial continued to do damage on the base paths, swiping his 12th bag of the season. Aguilar brought his RBI total up to 28, the second-most on the RiverDogs.
Charleston (32-34) got on the board in the first. Florial hit a two out double to left and Aguilar brought him in with a single to make it 1-0 RiverDogs.
West Virginia (31-34) answered back and took the lead in the third, scoring two off Perez. Left fielder Ty Moore walked with one out and was brought around by a double off the bat of first baseman Albert Baur. Third baseman Hunter Owen followed with a single that gave the Power the lead.
Cam Vieaux (2-3, 2.73) settled in until the fourth when Charleston tied it. Right fielder Isiah Gilliam led off the inning with a double, then scored from a single by left fielder Ben Ruta. In the fifth, Diego Castillo led off the inning with a single to spark Charleston to take the lead. The bases were loaded after a walk and a single before Gilliam hit a sac fly to deep left field giving the RiverDogs a 3-2 advantage.
Florial and Aguilar paired up again to give the RiverDogs some insurance in the seventh. Florial hit his second single of the game and scored from a double by Aguilar. Charleston got one more in the eighth as Ruta scored on a throwing error at third from Owen.
Phillip Diehl turned in three innings of relief work and shut down the Power as he collected his first save of the season. Vieaux took the loss after tossing 5.1 innings and allowing three runs on eight hits.
Ballpark Fun
The RiverDogs welcomed in armed service members and their families on a Military Appreciation Night at The Joe. As part of a “Wardrobe Wednesday” presented by WEZL and ABC News 4, the first 500 fans through the gates received a Holy City dog tag giveaway item.
Upcoming
Charleston will go for the sweep Thursday night against the Power at 7:05pm. The RiverDogs send to the hill right hander Jio Orozco (3-4, 5.36) to face righty Luis Excobar (5-2, 4.03). The game can be heard on “The Big Talker” WTMA 1250 AM and streaming live on the RiverDogs TuneIn radio station and on MiLB.tv.
Rask hasn't lost in regulation since Nov. 26. He improved to 18-0-2 in his last 20 starts, and had an assist on Schaller's score.
Marner and the Maple Leafs knew Rask was on a hot streak, and they felt like they needed more traffic in front of the net.
"He's been unbelievable the last month and a bit," he said. "We knew that coming in. When you give him his eyes, he's going to make the saves."
The Maple Leafs had their four-game winning streak stopped and lost for the first time in seven games against Boston after going 5-0-1.
"They came ready to play," Toronto goaltender Frederik Andersen said. "They were right on top of us getting out of the zone."
Pastrnak's score moved the Bruins ahead 2-1 when he came in on the right wing and fired a shot that caromed in off Andersen's left shoulder at 8:03. Krug one-timed a shot by Andersen with 3:13 left in the period. It was Andersen's first regular-season loss to Boston after he won his first nine games.
Bruins captain Zdeno Chara played his 1,400th NHL game.
The Bruins had jumped ahead when Bergeron fired a wrister past Andersen 4:29 into the game, stopping Toronto's shutout streak at 146 minutes, 46 seconds.
Less than a minute later, Rask made a right-pad stop on Kasperi Kapanen's clean break-in.
NOTES: Toronto D Ron Hainsey returned after missing the previous game due to an illness. ... Bruins D Kevan Miller was out with an upper body injury. . Boston F Brad Marchand served the fourth of his five-game suspension for elbowing New Jersey's Marcus Johansson. ... The teams face each other once more in the regular season, in Toronto on Feb. 24.

There have been reports that Intel has already started shipping its latest, Kittson version, Itanium processor chip.
The current Itanium processors are the 9500 series, code-named Poulson, and introduced in 2012. There are four versions: 9520, 9540, 9550 and 9560.
HPE uses Itanium chips in its high-end Superdome 2 servers, running the HP-UX operating system, and has previously said it will have a Kittson refresh coming out this year. Megsco has sued Oracle over Larryco's wish not to develop its software for Itanium servers any more – because of low sales and, now, Oracle's headlong cloud rush.
Our understanding is that Itanium was developed by Intel to compete with IBM's POWER and Oracle/Sun's SPARC processors. However, multi-processor, multi-core Xeon developments, the unwillingness of mainframe users to migrate to POWER/SPARC/Itanium server alternatives, and the rise of public cloud computing are three things that have weakened the POWER/SPARC/Itanium server market.
Itanium server sales are understood to lag POWER and SPARC server sales, with all three being a long way behind Xeon server sales. It is generally reckoned that Intel would like to dump Itanium and concentrate on its more mainstream Xeon and Knights Landing products.
Consequently Kittson is likely to be the end of the line for Intel's Itanium processor architecture products. Itanium does not provide significantly more powerful servers than Xeon chips do. Applications need specially developing and compiling to execute on Itanium, and HPE also bears the cost of developing Itanium server hardware and the HP-UX software. All-in-all Itanium-powered servers are costly beasts to develop, support and operate, and there is no easy migration path off them.
Another factor to bear in mind is that HPE has bought HPC server supplier SGI and its technology overlaps that of Superdome in the shared memory area. There has been speculation that there could be some kind of convergence of SGI and Superdome technologies.
HPE will, of course, support its Itanium customers for a number of years, at least until 2025, after having introduced Kittson-powered Superdomes later this year. There is no available information about any Kittson performance advantages over Poulson Itanium processors, although this will emerge when HPE launches its Kittson-powered Superdomes. ®
UPDATED: Following its contentious world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Terry Gilliam's “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” has been acquired from French sales company Kinology by Italy's M2 Pictures, which is planning to release it on Italian screens this fall.
“Don Quixote,” which stars Adam Driver, Jonathan Pryce, and Stellan Skarsgård, screened earlier this month as the Cannes closer after a French court threw out a request by producer Paulo Branco to block the premiere.
The film was also released on the same day by French distributor Ocean Films on about 300 screens in France thanks to a separate ruling that Kinology maintains has removed any and all impediments to the film's French and international distribution.
Branco's disputation over the rights to the film did, however, did prompt Amazon to pull out as the film's distributor in the U.S.
Reviews for the film have been mixed at best. Variety's Peter Debruge called it “a lumbering, confused, and cacophonous mess.”
Branco continues to claim that commercial exploitation of the film cannot go ahead, though in an email he told Variety that he is “open to negotiations.”
Branco and his Alfama Films allege that he was wrongly cut out as a producer on “Don Quixote,” in breach of an agreement that awarded him rights to the film. After Branco and Gilliam signed that agreement in 2016, funding for the production failed to come through, which sent Gilliam in search of new backers.
That was just one of a laundry list of problems that have bedeviled “Don Quixote.” Since Gilliam conceived of the project 25 years ago, he had to halt or abandon production several times because of on-set accidents and financial woes.
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated whether “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” received a theatrical release in France.
MARCH 19, 2018 – Moose Boats, San Vallejo, CA, has been awarded a San Francisco Fire Department contract for the construction of a M2-38 CBRN dive and fire rescue vessel which is set to go into operation in the third quarter of this year.
The aluminun catamaran vessel will be powered by twin Cummins QSB6.7 425hp turbo diesel propulsion engines with Hamilton HJ292 water-jets will power the M2-38 aluminum catamaran.
Serving primarily as a dive and rescue boat, the M2 will be outfitted with a integrated dive/recovery platform and a bow ladder for beach rescues.
The vessel was 75% funded by FEMA's FY2015 Port Security Grant Program and to meet its Homeland Security role, it will also be equipped with a Hale fire pump, flowing in excess of 1,500 gallons per minute of fire suppression water, radiation detection equipment and CBRN positive pressure cabin filtration.
A heavy-duty push knee will enable the M2-38 to come in contact with larger vessels and San Francisco's many piers.
The boat will be equipped with a wide range of electronics including a Simrad multifunction navigation screen, radar and 3D side scan sonar, L3 AIS, FLIR stabilized thermal imaging camera, Icom communications radios and an OTS diver recall system.
Including grapes in your diet may have a positive impact on your mental health as researchers have found that certain grape-derived compounds might be developed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of depression.
The results, published online in the journal Nature Communications, indicate that these natural compounds may reduce depression by targeting newly discovered underlying mechanisms of the disease.
"The discovery of these new, natural grape-derived polyphenol compounds targeting cellular and molecular pathways associated with inflammation may provide an effective way to treat a subset of people with depression and anxiety, a condition that affects so many people," said lead researcher Giulio Maria Pasinetti, Professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Depression is associated with a multitude of pathological processes, including inflammation of the peripheral immune system, a set of biological structures and processes in the lymph nodes and other tissues that protect against disease and abnormalities involving synapses, the structures that permit neurons to pass an electrical or chemical signal to other neurons.
However, currently available antidepressants are largely restricted to targeting the systems that regulate serotonin, dopamine, and other related neurotransmitters, and these treatments do not specifically address inflammation and synaptic maladaptations that are now known to be associated with major depressive disorder.
Previous research has found that grape-derived polyphenols have some efficacy in modulating aspects of depression, yet the mechanisms of action had largely remained unknown until now.
The new study found that a bioactive dietary polyphenol preparation from grape was effective in promoting resilience against stress-induced depression in mice.
Specifically, the researchers found that two grape-derived compounds dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA) and malvidin-3'-O-glucoside (Mal-gluc) can promote resilience in mouse models of depression by modulating inflammation and synaptic plasticity, respectively.
"Our research shows that combination treatment with the two compounds can promote resilience against stress-mediated depression-like phenotypes by modulating systemic inflammatory responses and brain synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of depression," said Jun Wang, Associate Professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“We've talked to family and survivors on what kind of process they would like, and this is the process they felt most comfortable with, and that's what we implemented,” she said Monday.
The inquiry's director of health, Terrellyn Fearn, said officials begin three days in Halifax on Tuesday, before moving on to Membertou and Millbrook First Nations.
HALIFAX—The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is making “community visits” in Nova Scotia this week, as it seeks to put a crisis of confidence behind it.
The visits are being held to prepare for nine community hearings starting this fall across the country, Fearn said.
For weeks, the commission has faced questions from concerned family members who say they have lost faith in the process, which is expected to take at least two years and cost $53.8 million.
In an open letter released last week, some family members called on the commission to start over from scratch, citing the resignation last month of one of the commissioners, Marilyn Poitras.
Some Aboriginal leaders have argued the inquiry has not put families first, and fails to respect their voices.
Fearn said Monday the inquiry is attempting to address concerns through these meetings.
“It's through these community visits that we'll actually be able to meet families and survivors in person, answer their questions and start to build a relationship with them so they'll feel comfortable enough to engage in the process,” said Fearn, herself a member of the Glooscap First Nation in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley.
Journalists have been asked to stay away from the sessions, which are being held at undisclosed locations. Inquiry officials are meeting with families and survivors who want to register with the inquiry, or have questions.
She said the inquiry has seen major growth in participation in the last month, and now has almost 500 registrants.
“Our shift in this new direction is illustrated by the vast numbers of increasing participants,” she said.
Families and survivors can speak to the inquiry's health support staff to discuss their options and possibly begin telling their stories ahead of the hearing, she said. Legal counsel will also be available if participants wish.
“I know there have been some concerns around the legalistic process of the hearings; this part of the community visit and our intake process is really focused around the family and the survivor. And they're really the one in the lead.”
Assembly of First Nations Chief Perry Bellegarde has acknowledged that First Nations leaders are divided on what to do about the troubled inquiry. Bellegarde is steering a middle course, saying the commission needs to focus all its energy on ensuring the stories of families are front and centre, adding it is critical it improves communications.
Last month, commissioner Michele Audette told the AFN that there was a lack of communication at the beginning of the inquiry process, in part because the commissioners were told not to speak or go to events. But she said they “were too silent,” which was a mistake.
She told reporters the inquiry has “been in crisis mode for quite a few weeks now.”
Fearn said her own family has experience with the issues being explored by the inquiry, and she has a responsibility to them.
“I know there are a lot of good constructive criticisms out there ... there are also a lot of good things that are happening, and there's a lot of support from families and survivors,” she said.
“By the very nature of the work, within Canadian society we are going to be pulling up the roots, shaking the roots of the marginalization of Indigenous women. And whenever you pull up those roots from the ground, it unsettles the earth. And I think a lot of what we may be seeing now is some of that unsettling.”
ISLAMABAD, Mar 19 (APP):Benzair Income Support Program (BISP) and National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) Monday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to lay out and agree on the broad framework of “Business Incubation for Self-employment” (BISE) Programme for graduation of its beneficiaries across the country.
The programme is financed by (Asian Development Bank) ADB under Social Protection Development Project, which is to be followed by signing of Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the BISE Programme, said a press release here.
The first phase of the US$35 Million BISE Programme shall be implemented over two years from April 2018 as further specified in the SLA by NRSP as implementing agency.
Chairperson BISP MNA Marvi Memon stated that the programme was envisaged in 2015 and it took three years to launch. She thanked the Secretary BISP and his team for their unequivocal efforts and further added that, “BISP must continue this programme.” The ADB and the Government of Pakistan mutually agreed to include NRSP as an “implementing agency” responsible for carrying out the “Business Incubation and Inclusive Business Components” of the BISP Graduation Program (BGP) on the terms and conditions to be agreed between BISP and NRSP and duly endorsed by ADB.
The said project has also been endorsed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. While opening the meeting, Secretary BISP, Omar Hamid Khan welcomed the guests and termed the partnership as “significant and momentous” for the vulnerable segments of society across the country.
He hoped that the partnership would benefit the BISP beneficiaries in unique ways in the years to come.
BISE aims at making poor people ready for taking up viable self-employment.
The program will target a total of 100,000 households in total 5 districts including Bahawalpur, Charsadda, Jacobabad, Kech and Nasirabad.
The selected beneficiaries shall be competent to be self-employed and show their willingness to be part of the graduation program.
Director General ADB Mr. Werner Liepach said, “We consider ourselves as partners, not donors.” He said that the partnership between BISP and ADB started with support for the Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) segment only. He added that US$400 million were initially given to BISP to increase the number of its beneficiaries.
He appreciated the efforts of BISP and said that he was happy to see that the programme was moving towards its second phase of graduating beneficiaries.
He further added that the flow of funds would not be a problem as the program progresses.
The key features of BISE programme comprise of profiling and validation of targeted households on their potential for self-employment. It includes social mobilisation and capacity building specific technical skill trainings and business development support, Income Generating Grants (IGGs), access to working capital through Community Investment Fund, business coaching through developing their capacities in asset and business management, numeracy and functional literacy and linkages development.
It also includes insurance of beneficiaries against accidental death, hospitalisation and disability risks, linking up the poor to the value chains of small and large companies in the private sector.
Ms. Xiaohong Yong, Country Director ADB added that BISP was rapidly implementing the graduation model and termed it as “light at the end of tunnel.” One of the major aspects include an agreement with the selected BISP beneficiary that UCT shall continue for only 1-2 years to provide protection against risks, thus, successfully graduating the BISP beneficiary out of poverty.
Rashid Bajwa, CEO NRSP hoped that this partnership would have a long-term impact on the lives of poor across the country. At the ceremony, Professor Reema Hanna, who is part of MIT-Harvard-LSE research team, stated that the graduation model was being tested around the world to eradicate poverty.
She hoped that the BISP's graduation model could offer field learning. She further added, “We've a real opportunity here as we can utilize this learning at global scale.”
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP)  Environmental advocacy groups are trying to halt construction of a $2.5 billion natural gas liquids pipeline across southern Pennsylvania while they appeal newly issued permits that they say would unleash massive and irreparable damage to the state's environment and residents.
In filings Monday night, three groups said the state Department of Environmental Protection had approved incomplete and legally flawed permit applications for Sunoco Logistics' Mariner East 2 pipeline hours earlier "in response to heavy and sustained political pressure."
Supporters view the project as crucial to helping capitalize on the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir, where producers complain that a lack of pipeline infrastructure is depressing prices and demand.
The permits approved water crossings and earth moving for a 306-mile section of 20-inch pipeline that can move 275,000 barrels per day, according to Sunoco Logistics.

The project is designed to move propane, butane and possibly ethane east from Marcellus Shale producers in southwestern Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and West Virginia to Sunoco Logistics' Marcus Hook processing and distribution facility near Philadelphia.
It has the support of Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature, business groups and labor unions.
According to the environmental advocacy groups, construction would deforest more than 1,500 acres, cross hundreds of streams and wetlands and damage farmland and aquifers that provide drinking water.
The Clean Air Council, Delaware Riverkeeper Network and Mountain Watershed Association did not elaborate on the political pressure in the filings to a state board that hears appeals of the department's actions. A hearing was scheduled for Thursday.
In an interview Tuesday, Maya van Rossum of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network said it was clear from the groups' reviews of documents in the case, meetings and conversations that Wolf's office and the department's central office were pressuring inspectors to stop asking detailed questions and wrap up.
"Governor Wolf wants to see these pipelines rushed out the door to make sure they happen," van Rossum said.
Wolf said Tuesday that he had not applied pressure to approve the pipeline project. He said he had only asked the department to stick to the timeline that it said it had needed to review the permit applications.
"That's not political pressure, that's actually trying to manage an organization," said Wolf, who had had the support of environmental advocacy groups in his 2014 gubernatorial campaign.
Wolf said he was convinced that the department had done its due diligence, and that the pipeline would ultimately have a net benefit, despite the potential environmental impact.
"The net benefit of having jobs, the net benefit of having clean sources of energy with gas is big for Pennsylvania," Wolf said.
He also echoed industry officials, pointing out that prices at one of the major trading hubs for Marcellus Shale gas remain below prices at other big hubs.
"We need a distribution system and this is part of it," he said.
Efforts to compel the United States Congress to reform the country's “antiquated” music copyright laws were the burning issues at the 2017 edition of the ASCAP Expo, as the performing rights organization's leadership attempted to advance causes designed to help its members earn a decent living.
ASCAP President Paul Williams noted that while the group collected a record $1.059 billion in 2016 on behalf of its songwriter, composer, and music publisher members, that increase of slightly more than 6% is inadequate when measured against the number of performances, which nearly doubled, to 1 trillion. “That disparity is due to our nation's outdated music regulations,” Williams said.
The point was brought into vivid relief by songwriter Priscilla Renea, who has written for Mary J. Blige, Chris Brown, and Miranda Lambert. Renea pointed out that the writers' royalty for a million streams, across all platforms, “is only about $170. So if it takes 15 people to make a song, which sometimes it can, how are we expected to be able to sustain a career?”
Added Williams: “Talk about feeling the pinch. We're bathing with lobsters!”
Here are five of the biggest takeaways from the ASCAP “I Create Music” Expo, which drew roughly 3,000 attendees to the Loews Hollywood Hotel in Los Angeles last weekend.
1. Although musicians actively supported Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, Donald Trump has emerged the great white hope of copyright activists in the music world. The views expressed by Karen Bass (D-Calif.) at a regulatory session were echoed by many at the meet: while it's too early for sure, the fact that Trump's regulatory approach is the diametric opposite to that of the prior administration was, according to Bass, “a boon” for songwriters. “We've all heard about the executive order that says for every new regulation two old regulations should be disposed of. That's a good starting place to re-look our consent decrees, which are among the oldest rules on the record, and prime candidates for review.” In fact, they're 76 years old. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) also sat on the panel with Bass.
2. Modernizing the system “is going to take friends,” according to Williams, who noted that for the past three years, ASCAP and its chief competitor, BMI, have been working together to urge the Department of Justice to update copyright laws — an effort that has yet to produce change, though the industry is watching with great interest as Trump's nominee to head the U.S. Justice Department's Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, moves to confirmation.
3. Among the legislative solutions on the table, the Copyright Selection and Accountability Act is earmarked as favorable to the music community. The bill, which proposes the U.S. Copyright Office become an independent agency, led by a presidential appointee, would give copyright parity with the other two intellectual property rights: trademark and patent, something the creative community-weighted copyright sector lacks. “Copyright should not be regulated [by Congress],” stressed attorney Dina LaPolt, moderating the panel “Getting Credit Where Credit Is Due.” “It's your property and you should be able to negotiate in a free market without the government saying what you should be paid. When there is a compulsory license, it means you are compulsed to say ‘yes.' These are horrible laws. In the U.S., songwriters are more heavily regulated than pharmaceutical companies. That is f—ing sad!”
4. Metadata may not sound sexy, but songwriters who like money will make a point of becoming intimate with the various ways to tag credits to tunes using it. The Swedish-based Auddly, a free service that allows songwriters to sign-up and input their credit data for automated music meta tagging, was something of a sensation at the meet. AdRev CEO Noah Becker put it in perspective, noting the key to generating royalties from streaming outlets. “Today, you have a line item worth a tenth of a penny and you have 10 million rows of those, whereas in the old guard music industry, you'd sell a CD with a 1,700% margin and you could manage it all in a Word doc.” Key to metadata success is keeping the tags to-the-letter consistent across all credits and platforms.
5. In the world of accumulating pennies rather than collecting dollars, Ben Patterson, CEO of digital distribution service DashGo.com, urged attendees to “think like a whale, not like a shark,” by opening wide and catching up tonnage of krill. “It's micro-revenue, but it does add up,” Becker said. “At AdRev, we manage rights for people you've never heard of who earn six-figure incomes from music. Myself, I'm not very active any more as a songwriter, but I have about 1,000 cuts of 15-30-second edits that generates $10-15,000 per year in passive income, and it just comes in.”

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Relatives of people killed in a 2016 California warehouse fire say others besides the two men who agreed to plea deals are responsible for their losses.
They are suing the city of Oakland, the building's owner and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., alleging issues related to inspections and maintenance.
Derick Almena and Max Harris each pleaded no contest Tuesday to 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the December 2016 fire at the illegally converted Oakland warehouse dubbed the Ghost Ship.
Prosecutors say Almena rented the warehouse and illegally converted it into a residence and entertainment venue. Almena hired Harris to help collect rent and schedule concerts.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm investigators said they were unable to determine a cause of the blaze.
9 dead, dozens injured in Oakland fire A woman places a candle at a makeshift memorial near the site of a warehouse fire that has claimed the lives of at least thirty-six people on December 5, 2016 in Oakland, California.

In court Tuesday, the judge read the name of each victim aloud at an emotional hearing, bringing tears from loved ones in the Oakland courtroom.
Prosecutors say the two defendants turned the warehouse into a "death trap" by cluttering it with highly flammable knick knacks and blocking the few exits in the poorly lit building.
Under terms of a plea agreement, Almena could be sentenced to nine years in prison and Harris could face a six-year term when a judge sentences them next month.
The men could have faced life in prison if convicted at a trial. Now, with good behavior, they are only expected to serve half their sentences after spending a year in jail.
David Gregory, whose 20-year-old daughter, Michela Gregory, was among the victims, said hearing the defendants say no contest was "some small sense of justice" but he was dissatisfied with the outcome.
"That's 36 lives, you know," he said outside court. "We wanted fair justice, and we didn't get it."
Parents and lawyers allege in the lawsuits that the Oakland Fire Department failed to inspect the warehouse annually as required. The lawsuit says inspectors would have discovered the illegal conversions.
Alex Katz, a spokesman for the Oakland city attorney, declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.
Warehouse owner Chor Ng, who has never been charged, did not return a phone message Tuesday.
The lawsuits claim PG&E failed to properly monitor, inspect and repair electrical equipment that provided power to the warehouse.
PG&E said in a statement that it cooperated with the investigation and that a review of its record found no electrical problems at the warehouse in the 10 years before the fire.

Beijing
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) signed a natural gas project with a Chinese company Monday to improve the air quality in Beijing.
“It is the common responsibility of the international community, including multilateral development banks, to tackle climate change. With substantial support of the board of directors of the AIIB, this project hopes to contribute to meet this global agenda,” AIIB President Jin Liqun said at the signing ceremony.
It marks the AIIB's first loan in China for a natural gas project. The 250-million-U.S. dollar loan will fund a project to connect 216,750 households in approximately 510 villages to the natural gas distribution network. Upon completion and after subtracting the emissions from burning natural gas, the project is expected to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 595,700 tonnes, particulate matter by 3,700 tonnes, sulfur dioxide by 1,488 tonnes and nitrogen oxide by 4,442 tonnes, according to the statement.—Xinhua
BERLIN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Negotiators trying to agree the parameters of a new grand coalition between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and Germany's Social Democrats said in a working paper seen by Reuters on Friday that they wanted to progressively abolish air transport tax over the coming legislative period.

The Wall St sign is picture in front of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., August 2, 2017.
LONDON (Reuters) - After this week's war of words between the United States and North Korea triggered the biggest fall in global stocks since the U.S. presidential election, investors are wondering what other off-radar shocks may be waiting to rock world markets.
Although there is little sign so far that investors are protecting themselves against a major sell-off, some say the current environment masks latent risks.
"Every day, our risk models tell us to take more risk because of falling volatility but with markets being where they are, we have to be very careful in not following them blindly," said James Kwok, head of currency management at Amundi in London.
"So we try to project scenarios on what can go wrong and where are markets not looking."
Such has been the extraordinary period of stability in financial markets in recent years that world stocks have hit a series of record highs while gauges of broad market volatility have plunged to record lows.
That benign investment environment has been fostered by central banks which have pumped vast sums of cash into economies since the global financial crisis that began a decade ago, lifting asset prices globally.
Flows into most asset classes have already overtaken peaks reached before the financial crisis.
For example, inflows into active and passive equity funds have nearly doubled to $10.9 trillion at the end of June 2017 from a September 2007 peak, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data. Inflows into bonds have meanwhile increased nearly three-fold to $4.1 trillion in that period.
Broad market gauges of risk, such as the CBOE Volatility Index, better known as the VIX, and its bond market counterpart, the Merrill Lynch Option volatility index remain pinned near record lows despite a spike this week.
But analysts say low market volatility masks the heavy weight of options written on these gauges by investment banks betting that the calm conditions will persist for a long time.
That has been accompanied by the growing popularity of inverse-volatility ETF products, which have doubled in value this year as market volatility has cratered.
Morgan Stanley strategists say the volume of bets on volatility remaining low means even a small increase in price swings could force some of these leveraged bets to unwind, triggering shock waves in the financial system and sending stock markets tumbling.
Daily percentage changes are important in the volatility world because a lot of these exchange-listed products and notes are rebalanced daily based on these changes, so that any large change would automatically trigger selling pressure elsewhere.
"This is why lower volatility creates higher risk," said Christopher Metli, a Morgan Stanley quantitative derivatives strategist in a recent note.
He estimates that a 12 point rise in the VIX could send the S&P 500 index down by 3.5 percent. A move of that magnitude was last seen after Britain's shock Brexit vote in June 2016.
But a spike in volatility is not the only scenario worrying investors.
Other risks markets may be ignoring include the implications of a messy British exit from the European Union and the risks that the Qatar crisis could spiral out of control in the Middle East and hit oil prices. Even the prospect of a newcomer at top of the U.S. Federal Reserve when Janet Yellen steps down in 2018 could prove unnerving.
"Today's low volatility is the calm before the storm and doesn't reflect the real world in which companies are operating, or the major uncertainties that are developing," said Paul Hodges, chairman at International eChem, a consultancy.
Another variable is the expectation that central banks will soon start unwinding their massive post-crisis stimulus measures, with unpredictable results.
One of the biggest risks seen lurking is the rise and growing influence on the world's stock markets of passive funds, which aim to track rather than beat benchmarks and charge lower fees than their more actively-managed peers.
The proportion of stocks on the main U.S. benchmark equity index that are now owned by such passive investors has nearly doubled since the 2008 crisis to 37 percent.
But redemption pressures on large passive investors could exacerbate any market selloff.
Apple Inc, a stock market darling, has a fifth of its outstanding stock held by index funds with Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street making up the top three holders, according to the latest Thomson Reuters data.
The head of sales of a large British-based bond fund said some of its clients are trying to put together pools of money with which to snap up beaten-down stocks if a large emerging market-focused ETF is faced with sudden redemption pressures.
"We get a lot of queries on what are some of the risks that markets may be overlooking, and that is what keeps us up at night," he said.

In about a month from the time this article is posted the New Jersey Devils will be starting training camp in preparation for the 2017-18 season. After a miserable season that saw them finish in the bottom of the Eastern Conference there were many changes to be made on the roster and GM Ray Shero subtracted and added a lot of players this summer. The franchise was also gifted with the number one overall pick in the 2017 NHL Draft when they won the draft lottery and vaulted from the sixth pick to the first, where they selected Nico Hischier.
Following New Jersey's Development Camp in early July Hischier signed his entry-level deal before heading back to his native Switzerland for the summer. His addition to the franchise has given them a shot of adrenaline to their rebuild as Shero and coach John Hynes look to get New Jersey back to the playoffs for the first time since 2012.
Make no mistake about it – Hischier will be given every chance to make the team's opening night roster and that possibility was made more likely when the Devils did not bring back a plethora of forwards from last year's group. It would be a shock if he wasn't on the team from jump street and throughout the entire season.
Since there's not much going on with New Jersey for the next month — other than agreeing to terms with restricted free agent defenseman Damon Severson — we decided to take a guess at what the roster could look like when they make their season debut on October 7 against the Colorado Avalanche at the Prudential Center.
Forwards:
Let's consider that Taylor Hall, Adam Henrique, Kyle Palmieri, Marcus Johansson, Travis Zajac, Brian Boyle and Pavel Zacha are all locks to be there opening night, which leaves six to seven spots available. Adding Hischier to this group, and Miles Wood (barring a regression) sets up a heavy battle for the final four or five forward spots.
Included in that battle will probably be Stefan Noesen, John Quenneville, Joe Blandisi, Michael McLeod, Blake Speers, Blake Coleman, Kevin Rooney and Nick Lappin. As of now, the Devils haven't announced any players coming to training camp on a PTO.
Noesen, Blandisi, and Quenneville saw enough time at the end of last season that they should have what it takes to win a spot and it appears that McLeod and Speers are ready to make the jump from juniors to the NHL, but don't sleep on Rooney or Lappin nabbing one of the final spots. Those two players are pretty well seasoned in playing against men after a season in the AHL and each has also had a taste of the NHL game.
With that here are the 14 forwards we think will be there on October 7:
Hall-Hischier-Johansson
Henrique-Zacha-Palmieri
Quenneville-Zajac-McLeod
Wood-Boyle-Noesen
Speers, Blandisi
Defense:
The puzzle is a little easier to solve on the Devils' blue line and we'll operate under the assumption that Severson gets a new contract and stays put. You can add his name to a group with Andy Greene, John Moore, Ben Lovejoy, and Steven Santini. That's five players and leaves us with only two spots to fill, setting up a competition amongst a handful of defenders.
Mirco Mueller, who was acquired from San Jose, will be given a good chance to win one of those spots as he battles with Dalton Prout, Yaroslav Dyblenko, Colton White, Colby Sissons and Michael Kapla.
Both Prout and Kapla have limited NHL experience like Mueller, while White and Sissons will be looking to make the jump over the AHL from juniors. White is a real dark horse pick here, as he has been with the organization for three years now and had his best development camp to date this year after a solid season in the OHL.
Here are the seven defensemen we think will be on the roster on October 7:
Greene-Severson
Moore-Santini
Mueller-Lovejoy
White
Goalies:
No drama. No intrigue. No question about it. With full confidence, we can say that the Devils two goaltenders come October 7 will be Cory Schneider and Keith Kinkaid.
“Water flying is the most fun I've ever had in aviation, and if I never fly anything other than my Cub on floats, I'll be happy,” says David Lewis, owner of a flight instruction business based in Pineville, Louisiana, called CUBS, FLOATS & FUN!
With multiple fixed wing, rotorcraft and instructor ratings, Lewis has the credentials to fly almost anything, including 737s, but his love is flying floatplanes.
A natural instructor with an easy-going style, Lewis' enthusiasm for water flying comes through in every lesson. And, fortunately for my son and me, he loves to share his passion with others.
The connection was made last year at the annual Seaplane Pilots Association (SPA) Corn Roast at Oshkosh, where I met Lewis, SPA's volunteer Field Director for Louisiana, as he was hawking raffle tickets. None of my tickets was a winner, but when it was announced that Lewis had donated a seaplane rating to be auctioned off, I knew I had to buy it.
Although I already had a seaplane rating from years ago, most of my time is in a Lake Buccaneer “flying boat” and I wanted to get more experience in a floatplane, with the idea that I might buy one or the other.
And, as it came time to renew the insurance on our Bonanza, I knew my son, Sam, would benefit from an additional rating and a fresh BFR.
Although you might not think of central Louisiana as an ideal locale to get a seaplane rating, for the past four years Lewis has operated from the Pineville Municipal Airport (2L0), where he discovered a perfect venue for seaplane training just across the Red River from Alexandria, Louisiana.
Pineville's 3,000-foot airstrip happens to be on a peninsula sticking out into Lake Buhlow, a small man-made reservoir that has a charted seaplane landing zone and a resident alligator named Elvis.
Using a converted helicopter trailer, Lewis is able to easily launch his 1952 PA-19-S (Army L-18C) Super Cub on straight PK 1500 floats from a nice ramp built by a former student and local asphalt contractor for his amphibious Seabee.
Lake Buhlow provides an ideal place to learn “confined area” water takeoffs and landings and a roomy mile-long oxbow lake formed by the river is just a quarter mile away.
Since no time is lost flying to and from a remote practice area, a minimum fuel load can be used and a dozen or more landings are usually logged in a one hour lesson.
Lewis also uses a section of the Red River (which is actually brown) to practice landing where there is a current.
An additional benefit of staying close to Pineville is that a 500-foot ceiling and a mile visibility is plenty for Lewis to conduct a lesson, since there's no need to climb more than 300 feet above the water.
Since Lewis' Super Cub only has a 90 horsepower engine, climbing even that far was a struggle on a hot day with me on board (at 250 pounds) instead of my slim son. However, I benefited from practicing the precise attitude and airspeed control demanded by the underpowered Cub. A planned 160 horsepower O-320 engine conversion will significantly improve the plane's performance.
Instead of following a set curriculum, Lewis uses a free-form method of flight instruction and lets his students progress as rapidly as possible, with the hope that he can include some advanced maneuvers if time permits during the fixed-price rating.
A native of Milwaukee, Lewis, 50, grew up around aviation as the son of an aeronautical engineer. After joining the Army right out of high school and learning to fly helicopters — Cobras, Hueys and OH58s — as a warrant officer, he later attended Embry Riddle Aeronautical University and obtained pro pilot and business degrees.
“I failed to follow my father's advice to never fly an ultralight and when the plane crashed after the engine quit, my ankles were crushed, along with other injuries,” said Lewis with a grimace. “I spent the next three months in the hospital and over the subsequent years I've had over 50 operations related to the crash.”
Fortunately, Lewis has not let the accident slow him down. In the early 1990s, he flew freight in Cessna 210s and Barons from Orlando Executive Airport and then spent 11 years moving around the country with Mesa Airlines, including being based in Maine, where seaplanes are very popular.
In 2007 he moved to Alexandria to fly with the U.S. Marshal Service, known as “Con Air,” and he also spent time as a civilian contract pilot flying classified missions in Afghanistan.
Most recently, until oil prices tanked, he flew with Petroleum Helicopters Incorporated (PHI) to deliver workers and supplies to oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.
RATINGS
Lewis can complete a seaplane rating in two days and allowing three days for the two of us turned out to be just right. He currently averages two or three float ratings a month and he recommends coming with a buddy so training flights can be alternated and the Designated Pilot Examiner (DPE), who flies in from over an hour away, can test two applicants for the rating instead of just one.
The flat rate seaplane training and check ride fee is $2,399. That covers everything, according to Lewis, including books, your check ride, a one year Seaplane Pilots Association membership, “and the most fun you can have flying!”
Lewis splits his time between Pineville and his main residence in Tomball, Texas, near Houston, where he and his wife, Sandee, operate a growing business selling all kinds of O-rings.
They fell into that specialized niche through sourcing O-rings to maintain spray equipment Lewis used in a previous business. Selling mainly online, he now estimates they are in the top 10% of O-ring distributors nationwide.
Lewis is close to getting his A&P rating and one of the phone orders he received during our time together was for a set of O-rings to rebuild a King Air nose gear.
“I like how my life is going these days,” added Lewis as we sat under a shade tree waiting on my son to return from his check ride with DPE Lyle Panepinto, president of Southern Seaplane, who flew to Pineville from his base near New Orleans in his Cessna 185 on straight floats.
“I now have the freedom to teach float flying and also run our O-ring business,” said Lewis, with obvious satisfaction. “I can always go back to the airlines, but I've made a lifestyle choice that I hope to continue.”
As for my son Sam, I'm pleased to report that he passed his check ride “with flying colors” and we've now started our search for a seaplane to be based at Chattanooga, near the Tennessee River and its numerous Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) reservoirs.
And, since we fly our turbo-normalized Bonanza mostly on long business trips at altitude and IFR, we too are hoping that having a seaplane will introduce us to a more relaxed lifestyle of fun flying on the water.
A new privacy-centric cryptocurrency project with some big names on board just raised a round worth noting. On Tuesday, the team at MobileCoin announced that Binance Labs, the major blockchain incubator associated with the Binance exchange, led a $30 million round denominated in bitcoin and ether for the new cryptocurrency. MobileCoin will enjoy “priority consideration” for being listed on Binance as part of the relationship.
New cryptocurrency projects are a dime (or less) a dozen, but the legitimacy of an established name can make all the difference. Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of end-to-end encryption messaging app Signal and Open Whisper Systems, is one such name. As Wired reported in December, Marlinspike began working with MobileCoin as a technical advisor in August of 2017.
Marlinspike is joined by Joshua Goldbard, a general partner at hedge fund Crypto Lotus and MobileCoin technologist, and Shane Glynn, legal counsel, to help the company navigate the choppy waters of cryptocurrency regulation. Glynn has served since 2010 as senior product counsel at Google, though it's not clear if he is leaving his longtime role for the new project.
In the MobileCoin whitepaper, published in December, the project's creators describe its mission:
…Most attempts at building a compelling crypto-currency user experience unfortunately resort to trusting a third party service to manage keys and validate transactions. This largely sacrifices the primary benefits offered by crypto-currency to begin with. MobileCoin is an effort to develop a fast, private, and easy-to-use cryptocurrency that can be deployed in resource constrained environments to users who aren't equipped to reliably maintain secret keys over a long period of time, all without giving up control of funds to a payment processing service.
MobileCoin is being built on the Stellar blockchain, a popular ethereum alternative that some projects are flocking to for its scalability and speed, and will emphasize user privacy and integration into mobile messaging apps, including WhatsApp and Signal — two apps that use Marlinspike's end-to-end encrypted Signal Protocol.
“MobileCoin is designed so that a mobile messaging application like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Signal could integrate with a MobileCoin wallet,” the team described in its whitepaper.
Marlinspike is a rare sort of reverse tech celebrity, a figure who eschews both spotlight and Silicon Valley-style excess and has instead cultivated quiet respect in digital privacy and cryptography circles. That makes him an odd fit for the fraud-laden universe of empty multi-million-dollar ICOs with no product to speak of, but it also means that MobileCoin is probably worth paying attention to. At the very least, the prominent cryptographer's new project should amuse anyone who's complained about the digital currency world's habit of using the term “crypto” as shorthand for “cryptocurrency.”
MobileCoin has funding and talent, but it's still very early days for the nascent cryptocurrency. As an incubator, Binance Labs concentrates on pre-ICO projects and MobileCoin will use the funding to “build out [its] team and processes” as it develops its product.
“A mobile-first, user-friendly cryptocurrency, like MobileCoin, plays a critical role in driving mainstream cryptocurrency adoption,” Binance Labs said of the funding. “The MobileCoin team and Binance Labs share a common vision and we are proud to be a supporter of what they are doing.”
Along with the news, MobileCoin announced that it is recruiting a “core team” of engineers:
“Specifically, we are looking for those who have worked on large systems (greater than 10,000,000 daily active users) in a senior role who enjoy working on low-level code. Direct memory access is a critical part of our problem set.”
Given the legitimacy of Marlinspike's best-known project and his reticence to attach his name to things, it's not unreasonable to give MobileCoin the benefit of the doubt, even if aspects of its raison d'être remain unarticulated. Beyond the core question of why a new cryptocurrency needs to exist at all, MobileCoin will need to position itself as a compelling alternative to existing mainstream mobile payment services like Venmo and PayPal for normal users.
MobileCoin will also face the full slate of regulatory challenges, including fraud prevention, that plague other digital currency projects, though given its stealthy behavior and the fact that one-third of the three-member team listed on its website represents legal counsel, its founders are don't appear to be charging in recklessly.
“This is a journey and we are excited to build a simple system for trusted payments,” Goldbard wrote in the announcement.
In the digital currency realm, too much style — think celeb-endorsed ICOs and endless press release hype cycles — can signal a lack of substance. The reverse can be true too, and in MobileCoin's case, a modest mission could be a strong signal for a compelling product a bit further down the blockchain.

TOKYO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The United States, Japan and South Korea will hold two days of missile tracking drills this week, Japan's Maritime Self-Defence Force said on Sunday, as tensions rise in the region over North Korea's fast-developing weapons programmes.
North Korea has fired two missiles over Japan as it pursues nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. sanctions and international condemnation. On Nov. 29, it test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching the mainland United States.
The exercises, on Monday and Tuesday, will be the sixth drill sharing information in tracking ballistic missiles among the three nations, the defence force said.
The United States and South Korea conducted large-scale military drills last week, which the North said have made the outbreak of war “an established fact”.
Last month's missile test prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea's leadership would be “utterly destroyed” if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests.
North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea, Japan and the United States and says its weapons programmes are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. (Reporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Nick Macfie)
(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday that it had approved Pfizer Inc's drug, Xeljanz, to treat adults with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis.

The effectiveness of Xeljanz in treating ulcerative colitis was shown in three controlled clinical trials, including two trials that showed the drug caused disease remission in about 17-18 percent of the patients.
The drug is already approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.
Xeljanz is expected to bring in sales of $2.16 billion in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It had generated sales of $1.35 billion in 2017.
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease that affects the colon and causes recurrent flares of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.
More than 900,000 people suffer from the disease in the United States, according to the FDA.
Pfizer's shares were up 1.1 percent at $36.11 in afternoon trading.

CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy said he was considering a break from golf to deal with a back muscle injury that left his left arm numb after his final round at the PGA Championship on Sunday.
"Right now I can feel my left rhomboid going into spasm. It's sort of the way it has been the last few weeks," world number four McIlroy said after shooting a three-under-par 68 at Quail Hollow to finish one over for the year's last major.
"It's a tough one because I go out there and play and shoot decent scores but when I come off the course I feel my left rhomboid going into spasm. Inside of my left arm goes numb."
The Northern Irishman injured the muscle in his upper back early this year in South Africa and had treatment on it, but was bothered again by the injury at The Players Championship in May.
"So I don't know what to do. I have got this next week off to assess what I need to go forward," he said, adding that he would consult with his trainer, Steve McGregor, who is a doctor, and consider his options.
"I'm flying home to Northern Ireland tonight. I'll catch up with Steve McGregor this week," McIlroy said.
"Just sort of have a chat with him about it and see what we need to do going forward. But the more I play, it's just not allowing that time to heal 100 percent.

"An injury like this, it's eight full weeks of rest before you start to rehab it and then you go again."
Last year McIlroy finished the season in high style, winning the Tour Championship finale and claimed the $10-million bonus prize for winning the FedExCup playoffs.
McIlroy said he might decide to skip the FedExCup events, which begin later this month.
"I feel like I'm capable and playing well enough to give myself a chance in it. At the same time, April is a long way away. That's the next big thing on my radar," he said, alluding to the Masters, the major he needs to complete a career grand slam.
McIlroy said he took the time he needed at the start of the year to heal and felt okay through the Masters in April but, after taking time off for his wedding and honeymoon, plunged back into training and did not build up the volume gradually.
"I went from zero to hitting balls for three or four hours a day. That aggravated it a little bit," he said.
"It's there. I can feel it. I can play 18 holes. I warm it up, it's okay. But once I get done, having to go through the whole routine of getting it ready to go again the next day, you shouldn't have to do that.
"If I want to challenge on a more consistent basis, I need to get 100 percent healthy."
* U.S. 10-year yield posts the longest weekly losing streak * Year-over-year U.S. wage growth strongest since 2009 * Fed's Williams calls for rate hikes as economy improves * U.S. 2-year yield dips on safe-haven bids as Wall St sags (Updates market action, adds quotes) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A strong U.S. payrolls report on Friday raised concerns the Federal Reserve might hasten to increase interest rates to stem inflation, compounding a bond market rout that pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to a four-year high. Global bond yields have been rising on expectations of improving global growth and speculation of reduced stimulus from overseas central banks. The spike in yields rattled stock markets this week on worries about the impact of rising borrowing costs on consumers and companies. "Right now, everyone is a bit nervous," said Gemma Wright-Casparius, senior portfolio manager at Vanguard in Malvern, Pennsylvania. "We are seeing a global sell-off in rates." While traders appear more upbeat on economic prospects outside the United States, domestic business activities have remained solid with signs inflation is edging closer to the Fed's 2 percent target. Some Fed officials have been reluctant to raise rates further without evidence of an acceleration in inflation, while others felt conditions are ripe for the Fed to further tighten policy. The Labor Department said on Friday that employers hired an additional 200,000 workers last month, more than the 160,000 they added in December. More importantly, average hourly earnings grew 0.3 percent, bringing the year-over-year increase to 2.9 percent, the biggest annual rise since June 2009. The encouraging wage figure lifted a gauge of investor expectations on inflation to its highest level in almost 3-1/2 years. INFLATION EXPECTATIONS The yield premium on regular 10-year Treasury notes over 10-year Treasury inflation protected securities grew to 2.14 percentage points, the most since September 2014, according to Reuters and Tradeweb data. San Francisco Fed President John Williams said on Friday that more rate increases are warranted as the economy has showed more improvement, but he did not favor increasing rates more than the three hikes the Fed has forecast for 2018. Interest rates futures implied growing bets the U.S. central bank will raise rates three times this year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury reached a four-year peak at 2.852 percent. It was last at 2.841 percent, up 6.8 basis points on the day, marking five consecutive weeks of increases for the longest such stretch since late 2016. The 2-year yield touched a more than nine-year high at 2.186 percent before ending lower to 2.145 percent on a bout of safe-haven buying. The S&P 500 and the Dow both scored their worst weeks in two years. The yield curve further reversed its earlier flattening move tied to expectations that inflation would stay muted. The yield spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries widened to 69 basis points, the most since mid-November after hitting a decade low nearly a month ago. "Yields can go higher, but I don't think they are going to stay there," said Rich Piccirillo, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income in Newark, New Jersey.

Volkswagen Group is launching a car-sharing service called WE that only uses electric vehicles, following the lead of rivals such as Daimler and BMW that have operated their own on-demand car rental services for years.
VW's car-sharing service will launch in Germany next year and then expand to major cities in Europe, North America and Asia beginning in 2020. The entire fleet will be electric vehicles, VW Group said Wednesday.
“We are convinced that the car sharing market still has potential,” Jürgen Stackmann, Volkswagen's board member for sales said in a statement. “That is why we are entering this market with a holistic single-source concept covering all mobility needs from the short journey that takes just a few minutes to the long vacation trip.”
The German automaker's WE business is designed to do more than car-sharing. The vehicle-on-demand platform will initially focus on car sharing. But eventually it will include other modes of transportation such as scooters.
Volkswagen showed off two electric concepts in March, an e-scooter it calls the Streetmate and Cityskater, which the company describes as a “last-mile electric street surfer.” Volkswagen sees the WE platform helping connect customers to car-sharing service, rent one of these micro-mobility vehicles, or even pay for parking.
The automaker also sees the WE platform connecting to MOIA, the automaker's mobility company that has launched a ride-sharing service with an all-electric shuttle vehicle. The all-electric car, which made its debut at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin in December, is designed to provide space for up to six passengers.
The vehicle-on-demand services available on the Volkswagen WE platform will be managed by UMI Urban Mobility International, a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG that began operating in 2018.

Thousands of folks lined-up the New Year tradition of receiving a blessing Sunday morning.
Lines formed at the Daijingu Temple of Hawaii in Nuuanu even before the clock struck 12 a.m. and continued into the day.
For many this is a tradition they've been taking part in their entire lives.
“We're just looking for good health, good health and business,” said temple patron Keri Krzykowski.
KHON2 was told as many as 8,000 people are expected to visit the temple for the blessing.
A $28.5-million lawsuit still hangs over Brampton City Hall, council is wrestling over a future route for a LRT corridor, long-standing policing policies in one of Canada's most-diverse communities are being challenged by residents and plans for the city's first university need to be hammered out. These are some of the critical issues facing Canada's ninth largest city in 2017.Some city hall watchers and councillors worry that the ongoing lawsuit launched by local builder Inzola Group against the city in 2011, regarding the handling of a historic downtown redevelopment deal, is causing reputational harm and the possible loss of business as it drags through the courts. “It's of the utmost importance that this matter be resolved in 2017,” says Councillor John Sprovieri, who has been critical of the city's handling of the six-year-old lawsuit, which Mayor Linda Jeffrey said has “paralyzed” city hall. “A lot of people are following what's happening with this lawsuit,” Sprovieri said. “There is a lot of speculation and much of it is negative. Until it is resolved this speculation and the allegations are a reputational issue for Brampton — it could be doing significant damage to our reputation.”Article Continued BelowAfter Inzola was disqualified from bidding on the project, its lawsuit was filed, alleging bias against the local builder by senior city staff and former mayor Susan Fennell in the awarding of a $500-million downtown redevelopment project. The city denies all the lawsuit's allegations. The city, responding to numerous questions from the Star about the lawsuit throughout 2016, did not address documents that had been filed with the court raising concerns about the conduct of senior staff involved in the selection process. The city stated that it had filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit “in its entirety.” In November, after more than 19,000 pages of documents supporting its case had been filed by Inzola to fight the city's attempt at dismissing the lawsuit, the city abandoned its dismissal strategy, dropping its motion, and now the case is heading for trial.

Got an older PC that's still running Windows XP or Windows Vista? Then you better update that computer now: Microsoft released a number of new patches for Windows computers Wednesday to prepare for possible attacks from nation states and other sinister actors.
Those patches are automatically being installed on more recent versions of Windows, provided that users didn't disable automatic updates.
Users of older Windows PCs should manually update their computers, said Microsoft Cyber Defense Operations Center General Manager Adrienne Hall in a blog post. “In reviewing the updates for this month, some vulnerabilities were identified that pose elevated risk of cyberattacks by government organizations, sometimes referred to as nation-state actors or other copycat organizations,” she wrote.
Microsoft phased out support for older versions of its PC operating system some time ago. But in light of a recent hacking attack that quickly hijacked hundreds of thousands of PCs, the company decided to release patches for those older, unsupported versions as well. “Due to the elevated risk for destructive cyberattacks at this time, we made the decision to take this action because applying these updates provides further protection against potential attacks,” wrote Hall.
A month ago, hackers targeted Windows PCs worldwide with a massive attack that resulted in the hijacking of more than 200,000 computers. The attack took down parts of the U.K. health care system, and affected a number of other companies and government institutions around the world.
The attack was based on an exploit that hackers had stolen from the NSA, leading Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith to demand that governments should stop stockpiling cyber weapons. “We need the tech sector, customers, and governments to work together to protect against cybersecurity attacks,” Smith said
Emergency response vehicles gather at Great Lakes Dragaway on Sunday, Aug. 13, 2017, near Union Grove, Wis. Three men were shot and killed during an auto racing event at the facility, a Wisconsin sheriff said. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth said authorities responded around 7 p.m. after receiving reports about shots being fired. The three men were shot by another man at point-blank range near a food vendor, Beth said at a news conference Sunday night. No suspects were arrested and no one else was injured.

Union Grove, Wis. — Three Illinois men who were shot to death at point-blank range during a drag racing event in southeastern Wisconsin may have been targeted by a rival gang member but a lack of cooperation has stymied the investigation, sheriff's officials said Monday.
The three were fatally shot as they stood near a concession area in the parking lot of the Great Lakes Dragaway near Union Grove about 7 p.m. Sunday, according to Kenosha County sheriff's officials.
The shooter remains at large, Sheriff David Beth said Monday. A lack of cooperation has made his detectives' work harder, he added.
“Some of the family members, some of the people involved, are not very cooperative with law enforcement. And, that's making it more difficult to investigate this whole thing,” Beth said on WTMJ-AM.
Sheriff's Sgt. Mark Malecki said the victims were from the Aurora area in Illinois.
“The victims were known gang members,” Malecki said, adding that deputies were investigating the possibility that the assailant was a rival gang member.
Two of the men died at the scene and the third died in an ambulance on the way to a hospital.
Beth urged any witnesses to the shooting to contact his department.
“A lot of people may not have wanted to come up and talk to the sheriff's department initially because maybe they were afraid someone was going to see them,” Beth said. “So what I'm hoping happens is someone who knows what's going on or saw what happened will call us, give us more information and help us catch the individual who did this.”
The sheriff's office estimated that more than 5,000 people were at the raceway for an event known as “Larry's Fun Fest.” The track's website shows the event included drag racing, tailgating, live entertainment and a car show.
Union Grove is about 25 miles south of Milwaukee.

The man responsible for shooting House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others during a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia has been identified as 66-year-old James T. Hodgkinson from Belleville, Illinois.
In a White House speech addressed to the nation, President Trump stated on Wednesday that Hodgkinson died from injuries sustained during the shooting. He also expressed his well-wishes to Representative Scalise and the other victims involved in the incident.
Early reports indicate that Hodgkinson was a member of a number of anti-Republican groups, one of which is called "Terminate the Republican Party." The Washington Post and other outlets report that the shooter's alleged Facebook page contains several posts of strong, anti-Trump rhetoric.

Here are some fascinating Facebook posts from James Hodgkinson, the Alexandria shooter. pic.twitter.com/9hLaWQCpoZ — Elizabeth (@BasedElizabeth) June 14, 2017
Other such groups identified on Hodgkinson's social media account are listed as "The Road to Hell is Paved with Republicans," "Donald Trump is not my President," and "Expose Republican Fraud." The Belleville News-Democrat is reporting that Hodgkinson had an arrest record for several offenses, including damaging a motor vehicle, resisting a peace officer, eluding police, and driving under the influence.
Just prior to the shooting, the baseball field was occupied by a group of Congressmen and members of their staff practicing for a baseball game. Rep. Scalise, a staffer for Republican Rep. Roger Williams from Texas, and two Capitol Police officers protecting Scalise were among those injured when Hodgkinson opened fire.
Ivanka Trump, a senior advisor to President Trump, this morning visited a high-tech center where central Iowa high school students are working on projects for local businesses.
“This is an unbelievable example of innovation in education,” Trump said, “and pairing the skills being taught in a classroom environment with the jobs in demand in the modern economy.”
Trump met with students in two classrooms to see what she called their “work of the future.”
“I was personally very excited to see so many young ladies who were here today because women and minorities have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields,” Trump said. “And, as we embark on the fourth industrial revolution, it's critical that trajectory changes.”
After the tour, Trump sat down for a longer discussion with state officials, teachers, people from businesses involved in the center and students. One student said he had a “light bulb moment” when working on a construction site that has changed his perspective on what he can do after high school.
Trump replied that she had a “special place in my heart construction,” prompting the crowd to laugh. “My old life as a builder — I understand why you're passionate about it.”
Trump promised “a very important component” of the president's infrastructure proposal would be investment in broadband for rural Americans.
“To be able to innovate and grow their businesses and develop themselves,” Trump said, “by being connected.”
Trump also said efforts were underway to ease federal regulations for apprenticeships and expand the federal work-study program to more employers.
AUDIO of discussion, 40:00
Republican Governor Kim Reynolds hosted Trump, starting with an early morning breakfast at the governor's mansion, then the tour of classrooms at what's called the APEX center in Waukee. Reynolds pressed for changes in federal college grant programs — so the grants could be used by high schoolers who take classes at community colleges.
After Trump left, Reynolds told reporters she hopes the “First Daughter” takes that idea back to Washington.
“Really providing flexibility to states, so that we can be innovative and think outside of the box,” Reynolds said.
Trump did not take questions from reporters. Before she arrived, students and staff at the center were warned if they asked Trump questions about politics or “current events,” they'd be escorted out by the Secret Service.
The Iowa Democratic Party held a counterprotest at a city park in Waukee, accusing Ivanka Trump and Reynolds of pursuing an agenda that “puts special interests ahead of workers.” The chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party said while is “claiming to care” about American workers, she outsourced production of Ivanka Trump-branded shoes to China.

Selena Gomez stepped out in Los Angeles on Friday afternoon looking as stylish as ever.
The former Disney starlet, 25, was all smiles as she was spotted grabbing a bite to eat at Casa Vega in Sherman Oaks.
Dressed in denim button up overalls and a white vest top, fashion forward Selena looked every inch the off duty A-lister.
She paired the hot look with tan sandals and wore her dark hair in loose, messy waves.

After grabbing food, the star and her group of pals soaked up the warm California sun in a nearby park.
She's been keeping a low profile lately, but earlier this week she turned out to support on-off boyfriend Justin Bieber at a hockey game.
Her outing on Friday comes after her fans noticed she'd stopped following her mum Mandy Teefy on Instagram, sparking rumours of a fall out.
(Image: Splash News)
Shortly before that, TMZ had reported that Mandy was admitted to hospital due to a huge argument with Selena over the Baby singer.
But People magazine later shot down the report, saying she was voluntarily checked out by medical staff last week.
(Image: http://www.wenn.com/)
A source close to the family told the publication: “It's been a stressful time for Mandy and she made the decision herself to go to the hospital and make sure everything was okay.
“This wasn't just about Justin.”
A Selena source added: “It's true her family doesn't approve of Justin, but this wasn't just over a fight about him.”
The NHL has its first Aussie.
Washington Capitals forward Nathan Walker is scheduled to make his NHL debut against the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday, becoming the first Australian national to play in the NHL.
The 23-year-old Walker, born in Sydney, became the first-Australian to be drafted when Washington selected him in the 3rd round, 89th overall, in 2014.
"I don't want to be known just as being the Aussie," Walker told ESPN.com during Capitals training camp.
"But I do realize that it is a big deal for Australian hockey."
Walker, a 5-foot-9, 186-pound left wing, was first drawn to hockey by watching "The Mighty Ducks." He began playing hockey in Australia but moved to the Czech Republic for junior hockey.
Walker has represented Australia in several international competitions, including the 2011 IIHF World Championship Division II tournament and the 2012 World Championship Division 1 Group B tournament.
In 202 career games with the Capitals' AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears, Walker has tallied 34 goals and 45 assists.
On Sunday, April 22 at 3:25 a.m. a terrorist killed four innocent people at a Waffle House restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee. The killer was Travis Reinking, 29, who was naked, fled on foot and finally captured by police earlier today. James Shaw Jr., 29, managed to wrestle the weapon out of Reinking's hands, which made him run. Thanks to Shaw, many lives were saved.
The killer used an AR-15, which was reportedly given to him by his father who was ordered by a court to not give his son the gun because of mental health issues — he once crossed a barrier at the White House. In deeply disturbing news, Reinking has made bond.
SEE ALSO: Calls For Starbucks Boycott After The Company's Weak Apology For A Racist Arrest
USA Today reports Reinking's bond was set at $2 million, $500,000 for each of the people killed. Their lives were only worth $500,000 a piece? Considering Reinking is a terrorist who killed four people and was on the run for 36 hours, there is no logical reason why he should have made bond. Any rich racist can decide to pay his bail and he could be back on the streets with his incompetent father who give his psycho son guns.
The hypocrisy is disgusting. In 2015, Jamycheal Mitchell was arrested by police in Portsmouth, Virginia, for stealing $5 in groceries. He had mental health issues and spent four months in jail without bail. Mitchell died in his cell in August 2015. He was 24 years old.
In April of last year, Meek Mill was denied bail for breaking his probation. Mill didn't commit anything close to a violent crime.
In March, Richard “Stitch” Daniels, 52, was held without bail for a large-scale marijuana trafficking operation. No bail and he didn't kill anyone.
This is exactly why people of color do not trust the criminal justice system.
We should also note Trump has not tweeted about this. Let's imagine if this were a Muslim man who killed four white people, Trump would be tweeting all day.

Do you like your cars rough, ready, and exceedingly rare? Of course you do.
This is a 2008 Ferrari FXX Evoluzione. It's rough, in the sense that it's a stiff-riding machine built to devour racing circuits. It's ready by way of sitting pretty with just 1,300 miles on its odometer. Finally, it's exceedingly rare because this is one of just 30 FXX cars produced by Ferrari—and this is the only one that is legal to drive on the road.
That's right. This car is basically one of one. The owner took it back to Ferrari and convinced the Prancing Horse ($) to alter this car to make it legal for road use in the owner's native England. That means taillights, turn signals, a handbrake, and a system that can raise and lower the nose were all fitted to this particular car. While the rest of the FXX owners have to stop and load their cars on the trailer before leaving the circuit, this one can drive all the way home.
The FXX is essentially a heavily modified version of the Enzo. The original 6.0-liter V-12 engine is pumped out to 6.2 liters with output rising to more than 800 horsepower. To change gears you'll tug on one of the paddles connected to the 6-speed sequential racing transmission. If you want to hear your passenger, you had better be wearing the Ferrari-branded headphones.
Wisely, all of the bits that made this legal for track-use only have been retained. They can be refitted to the car if desired. But we urge the future owner not to do that. This is still a wildly capable machine, and it's the only one of its kind in which can make runs to the grocery store. Theoretically, you could also hit the 247 mph top speed along the way.
That's if you can afford to pony up the $12 million it will take to put it in your garage.

WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen expects cash outflows of 4-5 billion euros ($4.7-5.9 billion) next year in relation to the dieselgate emissions cheating scandal, the carmaker's Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter told journalists on Monday.
A Volkswagen logo is pictured at the International Auto Show in Mexico City, Mexico November 23, 2017. REUTERS/Henry Romero
“I am not at all relaxed with regard to the diesel issue,” Witter said. The figure is below the up to 17 billion euros in outflows expected this year.
Dieselgate has so far cost the company more than 25 billion euros and contributed to a strategy shift in the sector towards electric vehicles, with most manufacturers having announced far-reaching investment packages.

Sylvester Stallone is teaming with MGM to produce a movie about boxer Jack Johnson, who was recently posthumously pardoned by President Donald Trump.
The film will launch Stallone's Balboa Productions, created to develop film and television projects.
Johnson was a dominant boxer and the first African-American heavyweight champion. Stallone was instrumental in obtaining a presidential pardon for Johnson, who was convicted of violating the Mann Act in 1910 for transporting a woman across state lines for “immoral purposes.”
MGM Motion Picture Group president Jonathan Glickman and MGM executive vice president of production Adam Rosenberg are overseeing the film on behalf of the studio.
Stallone partnered with MGM on the Rocky movies and the “Creed” spinoff. “Creed II,” which hits theaters in November, is the continuation of the Rocky franchise and the sequel to 2015's “Creed,” which earned more than $170 million at the worldwide box office. The new film, starring Michael B. Jordan and Stallone, is being directed by Steven Caple Jr., from an original screenplay written by Stallone based on characters from the franchise.
Balboa Productions has also entered into a multi-year deal with Starlight Culture Entertainment for feature film development. Stallone teamed with producer Braden Aftergood on the endeavor.
Aftergood most recently worked at Eighty Two Films, and previously executive produced “Wind River” and “Hell or High Water.”

Two decades ago, an Indian army officer killed a civilian in Brath village of Sopore and took his body, keeping his grave empty forever. There is an empty grave in Brath area of Sopore which was dug for a man, killed by the Indian army in the village in 1995.
After killing the man, the villagers say, the army took the body and declined to return it. “The grave which we dug for my husband was lying open for 11 days, but when the army officer declined to return the body, we closed it by burying some clothes in it,” said Sharifa Begum, widow of Nazir Ahmad Mir, a resident of Mir Mohalla, Brath. Villagers describe the day as one of the darkest days in their memory when an unarmed innocent civilian of the village was ruthlessly beaten up, dragged, tortured and killed.
It was on the 9th of June, 1995, Sharifa says, that her husband, Nazir Ahmad, was working in his fields when Major A K Chatterjee of the 9 Gorkha Regiment from Seelu camp, an officer who had terrified the village, swooped down on him, dragged him, beat him ruthlessly and took him away. Sharifa only came to know of the incident in the evening, when Nazir didn't return from the fields.—KMS
A day after he declared a narrow victory in a referendum vote that radically expands presidential powers, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is criticizing elections observers and their concerns about the fairness of the vote.
Decrying a "crusader mentality," Erdoğan told a crowd of his supporters that the international monitors should "know their place," according to Reuters. Erdoğan added that Turkey did not "see, hear or acknowledge" the reports of irregularities from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Preliminary returns say the presidential proposal passed by just 51 percent of the vote.
The European monitor released preliminary findings about Sunday's poll, saying the vote "took place on an unlevel playing field and the two sides of the campaign did not have equal opportunities."
Its report states that "while the technical aspects of the referendum were well administered and referendum day proceeded in an orderly manner, late changes in counting procedures removed an important safeguard and were contested by the opposition." The OSCE also said the vote did not meet standards set by the Council of Europe.
Allegations of vote rigging are uncommon in Turkey, Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy tells NPR. "We don't know whether the amount of vote fraud was significant enough to change the outcome — or more than 1 percent — but definitely something happened."
But in a country that is deeply divided, "where it's almost half and half for and against Erdoğan, if you even have allegations of voter fraud, whether or not it happened, his legitimacy will be completely and constantly questioned by that half that does not vote for him."
That could present problems for Erdoğan in the future, Cagaptay says.
Acting State Department spokesperson Mark Toner said U.S. officials have noted the OSCE's concerns, according to Reuters. "We look forward to OSCE/ODIHR's final report, which we understand will take several weeks."
Considering how tilted critics called the campaign, NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul says many were surprised at how close the vote was.
"It's close enough that the opposition says it's going to challenge alleged irregularities," he says. "It might be an uphill fight. It could be days or longer before we know the final results."
The new framework expands Erdoğan's powers and means he could potentially stay in office until 2029. As Peter explains:
"Power would be more concentrated under the presidency. "If the referendum is approved by majority vote, the office of prime minister would be abolished after the next elections, scheduled for 2019. Another body, the Council of Ministers, would also go, and all executive and administrative authority would be transferred to the president's office. ... "The change would increase Erdoğan's influence over who runs for Parliament. "Cabinet ministers would no longer have to be members of Parliament, and the Parliament would not have power over Cabinet appointments — ministers would be appointed directly by the president."
People who voted "Yes" say concentrating power in the hands of the presidency will make the country more stable, while critics say it will fundamentally undercut Turkey's democracy.
Cagaptay says Erdoğan "has become the most powerful person in the country's history in at least a century."

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani left open on Saturday the possibility for talks with militants who accept peace but said the door was closed to those who cause tragedies like recent attacks in the capital, Kabul.
An attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul on Jan. 20 and a suicide bombing on a crowded city street a week later have stoked public anger and stepped up pressure on Ghani's Western-backed government to improve security.
The attacks, which killed more than 130 people and were claimed by the Taliban, have also raised fresh doubt about long-running efforts to initiate talks with the insurgents.
The president's office said on Tuesday the militants had crossed a “red line” and peace would have to be won on the battle field.
But Ghani raised the possibility of reconciliation with some militants in a speech to Islamic clerics in Kabul.
“Those who are responsible for this tragedy and do not want peace, the door of peace is closed to them,” Ghani said.
“Those who accept peace, they will witness that the nation will embrace them. But there is a clear difference, our commitment to bringing peace does not mean we will sit quietly and won't retaliate.”
“We will dig them out from any hiding holes.”
Afghanistan's government has made such vows for years but the insurgency appears ever more resilient. Peace efforts have been made in fits and starts but without progress.

U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to dash any hope for peace efforts on Monday when he condemned the Taliban for the Kabul violence and rejected the idea of talks.
Trump last year ordered an increase in U.S. troops, air strikes and other assistance to Afghan forces, to force the Taliban to negotiate.
But his comments on Monday suggested he saw a military victory over the Taliban, an outcome that U.S. military and diplomatic officials said could not be achieved with the resources and manpower he had authorized.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan said in Kabul on Tuesday the U.S. strategy had not changed and the aim was still to press the Taliban militarily to convince them that they had to negotiate.
The Taliban are fighting to drive out foreign troops and re-establish their form of strict Islamic law.
Afghanistan has long accused neighbouring Pakistan of failing to act against Taliban plotting violence from safe havens on the Pakistani side of the border.
On Friday, Ghani accused Pakistan of being the “Taliban centre” and said he was waiting for Pakistani action.
Pakistan denies helping the Taliban and a Pakistani delegation led by Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua visited Kabul on Saturday with the aim of fostering cooperation. Janjua called for both sides to stop the “blame game”, Pakistani media reported.
The United States said last month it would cut security aid to Pakistan, complaining it was not doing enough to fight militants sheltering there.
Police Say Suspected Drunk Driver Crashed Into Traffic Light & Pole
July 4, 2018
Temporary stop signs have been installed at an intersection in Fenton after a suspected drunk driver destroyed a large traffic pole.
A suspected drunk driver struck the traffic light and pole at the intersection of Rounds Drive and Shiawassee Avenue around 3:15am Sunday. The Tri-County Times reports the man was traveling eastbound on Owen Road/Shiawassee Avenue. The road curves at the traffic light but the driver, a 24-year-old Sterling Heights man, is said to have steered directly into the pole. The man fled the scene but was located in a nearby neighborhood. He had sustained injuries in the crash and was transported to a hospital. The results of a blood draw are pending.
The Genesee County Road Commission will be installing a temporary traffic light while a new specialty pole is ordered. Fenton's Department of Public Works has since installed stop signs at the intersection, which will be treated as a four-way stop. Officials are working to get a temporary pole and signal installed as soon as possible, hopefully next week. (JM)

LAWRENCEBURG, Ky., Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Following in his father's and grandfather's footsteps, Wild Turkey Master Distiller Eddie Russell decided to dabble in the family business a few miles from his boyhood home at the Wild Turkey Distillery. That was back in 1981, and the new college grad wasn't quite sure the distilling business was for him. Flash forward more than three decades and the student has become the master, celebrating his 35th anniversary and releasing some of the finest whiskies the Bluegrass State has to offer. To mark the occasion, Eddie is releasing Wild Turkey Master's Keep Decades, the second limited-edition Bourbon in the Master's Keep series.
“For Master's Keep Decades, I went all out and used some of the rarest and most precious barrels in our stocks,” said Eddie Russell. “The final product is a whiskey with the finesse and deep character of older Bourbon, anchored by the bold, balanced, and vibrant backbone of younger bourbon. I have to say, this is a whiskey I truly love and I'll be holding a few bottles back for my personal collection.”
With this release, Wild Turkey looks back on the long road to the release of Master's Keep Decades, which started on June 5, 1981, when Edward Freeman Russell put his work boots on for the first time at Wild Turkey. Starting the same way his father did, Eddie had to master every menial job in the distillery before being promoted to supervise the rickhouses where the barrels aged. As he got further along in his career, his father, legendary Master Distiller Jimmy Russell, began to pass down the knowledge he had learned from his own mentors, while instilling in Eddie the values of integrity, craftsmanship and never compromising on quality.
In 2015, Eddie earned the illustrious title of Master Distiller and joined his father at the distillery's helm. Today, the two Bourbon Hall of Famers work side by side as the industry's only active father and son master distiller duo, boasting almost 100 years of combined experience. With the same sense of humility, humor and passion for perfection as his father, Eddie continues to influence the ever-expanding whiskey industry and bring new products to market, including Wild Turkey Bourbon (formerly known as Wild Turkey Bourbon 81), Wild Turkey Diamond Anniversary, Wild Turkey Master's Keep and now, Wild Turkey Master's Keep Decades.
“When Eddie started working at the distillery, I didn't make it easy for him. I didn't want people to think I was giving him special treatment, so I made him do a lot of hard, thankless work to earn everyone's respect,” recalled Master Distiller Jimmy Russell. “Watching him step into his own, earn the admiration of his peers and create some of the best whiskies I've ever tasted has been the most fulfilling experience a father could ask for.”
Made from a blend of whiskies aged 10 to 20 years, this 104 proof (52% alc. /vol.) Kentucky Straight Bourbon has a nose of oak and caramel. It delivers beautifully intricate notes of butterscotch, dried fruit, chocolate, and smoke, and lingers with a smooth, sweet, and spicy finish. Available nationally and at the Wild Turkey Visitor Center in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, Wild Turkey Master's Keep Decades will retail for $150 for a limited time.

Snow and ice can make for dicey conditions on the roads.
Hundreds of accidents were reported over the weekend during the season's first snowfall, but on Monday it was a different story.
"Not bad, everybody's driving sane," said Georgejean Ridley, driver. "This is the first practice run of the year for me so we'll keep our fingers crossed."
Many drivers said they found the interstates and expressways manageable.
"I haven't had any trouble today," said Lynda Schodowski, driver.
She said the only thing making her nervous is other motorists.
"I think the trucks are going too fast," Schodowski said.
However, it wasn't an easy commute for everybody.
"Lot of ice building up. I had to stop because of my windshield. We had to let it defrost. It's pretty bad," said Branden Knack, driver.
Knack said he would like to see the snow take a break.
"We're kind of waiting a little bit to see if it's going to clear up out there. It's not looking like it's gonna so nothing we can really do," Knack said.
Meanwhile, crews with the Michigan Department of Transportation said they have been working around the clock to keep the main roads clear.
"Whenever there's a snow event we have every piece of iron out on the road doing all the removal we can," said Robert Ranck, MDOT spokesperson.
He said snow removal efforts are going well, but he cautions drivers to keep their guard up.
"As the temperatures get cold like that we end up melting the snow and then that could refreeze," Ranck said.
Richard Coleman said the streets in his Saginaw neighborhood are slippery. He said he is worried about more than lack of traction in residential areas.
"The visibility, you know what I'm saying? You can't see and sometimes you get a whiteout," Coleman said.
Saginaw City Chief Foreman Simeon Martin said he is aware of the problem, but so far the weather hasn't given him the chance to address it.
"It was a light snow, but it's been a steady snow off and on. And right now we're concentrating on the schools, hospitals, state highways and your majors. And when we finally get a break in the snow we'll go through and do the intersections," Martin said.
Martin said his crews will probably start working on the intersections of local streets on Tuesday.
This is just the beginning of the winter driving season and people like Ridley said they are ready for the challenge.
"We'll get used to it," Ridley said.

On Saturday afternoon, the New Jersey Devils' season came to an end, as they were defeated by the Lightning to end their postseason run. Despite the loss, they accomplished a great deal in 2017-18 and finished well ahead of most's expectations. With the organization now moving ahead and looking into the future, there's plenty of reason to be excited about the direction of the Devils heading into 2018-19.
Devils' Core Young and Talented
One of the keys to the Devils success this season was due to the performances from their core players — starting with Taylor Hall. After a tough 2016-17, he increased his point totals by 40, finishing with career highs in points (93), goals (39), and assists (54). Had he not produced at an MVP level, it's unlikely the Devils would've qualified for the postseason.
While Hall was by far and away the Devils' best player this season, the team still managed to get significant contributions from other players. Kyle Palmieri, who missed 19 games due to injury, finished with 44 points in 62 games — good for a 58 point pace over an 82-game season. Palmieri has been one of the Devils' most consistent players since being acquired in a trade in 2015, and despite injuries, this season was no different.
The Devils also relied on several first and second-year players to make the playoffs. Nico Hischier finished his rookie campaign with 52 points (20 goals, 32 assists), while Miles Wood finished with 19 goals, an 11-goal jump from last year. Blake Coleman, who only had two points in 23 games last season, finished with 25 in 79 games this season and was one of the team's top defensive forwards.
In addition to Hischier, Wood, and Coleman, Jesper Bratt made a name for himself with a strong preseason and first half of the regular season. Despite totaling only nine points in his final 34 games, Bratt finished the season with 35 points in 74 games. He was a regular through most of the season and spent plenty of time on the top line with Hischier and Hall — pretty impressive considering he was a sixth-round pick just in 2016.
On defense, Will Butcher proved to be a steal and had one of the best rookie seasons for a defenseman in franchise history. He finished with 44 points in 81 games, which is the most for a rookie defenseman since Scott Niedermayer's in 1992-93. At 23-years old, he figures to be a valuable part of the Devils going forward and should see an increased role next season.
What all these players mentioned above have in common is that they're 27 years old or younger. All are under team control for the foreseeable future, as well. That positions the Devils to build on this year's success not only in 2018-19 but in the years to follow.
Devils Filled with Exciting Prospects
When Ray Shero took over as Devils general manager in 2015, the Devils' pipeline was lacking speed and skill. Since then, the organization has made a priority of drafting young forwards who fit the speedy style of hockey they want to play. They even saw the benefits of that this season with Hischier and Bratt.
Over the next season or two, the Devils should see more of these prospects making a push to make the NHL roster. John Quenneville, who missed plenty of time with injury this season, has been knocking on the door for a couple of seasons now. He's played in 14 NHL games the last two seasons but hasn't been able to maintain a regular spot with the big club. Could 2018-19 finally be the season he cracks the NHL roster?
Quenneville is not the only forward in the AHL who has a shot at the NHL next season. Nick Lappin finished as the Binghamton Devils' second-leading scorer with 53 points in 65 games. He's also played a total of 49 games with the big club since 2016 and could be ready for a shot at a regular spot much like Quenneville.
While Lappin and Quenneville may be the closest players to earning an NHL spot, other prospects are on the way, too. Joey Anderson, who just won a National Championship with the University of Minnesota Duluth, signed an ELC with the Devils during the playoffs. Michael McLeod, the team's first-round pick in 2016, will also begin his first full professional season in 2018-19. The organization also has a few promising prospects over in Europe, such as Jesper Boqvist, who could be a year or two away from making their NHL debuts.
The Devils may not be as loaded on defense as they are up front, but they do have a couple of prospects that should help their back end over the next few seasons. That said, they do lack an A-level defense prospect and is something they make take a look at in this year's entry draft.

Final Thoughts on Devils Season
The Devils are already reaping the benefits of their young players, such as Hischier and Butcher, at the NHL level. Their best players are locked up long-term, and they have more talent working up through the system. The Devils do have quite a few needs entering the offseason, but they'll have around $20 million in cap space to help address some of them. Given that and the prospects they have coming up, the Devils are in a prime position to sustain their success beyond the 2017-18 season.
It's really unfortunate that with the passage of time our public libraries are being continuously abandoned due to lack of public interest and government negligence. This national apathy has reduced the already shrunk space for the growth of reasonable minds of this nation. Libraries play an important role in the process of national growth by providing a conducive environment for the inquisitive minds.
The act of reading is a great growth factor: it mushrooms sanity within a society. It's about time that the government should devise a comprehensive plan to revive these fast depleting avenues of intellectual growth and save this nation from falling prey to ignorance and the onus lies on general public as well to utilize this space for their own well being.

Band To Watch honorees Kississippi have been pretty quiet since releasing a pair of EPs a few years ago — 2014's I Can Feel You In My Hair Still and 2015's We Have No Future, We're All Doomed — but Zoe Reynolds' project has returned today with “Cut Yr Teeth,” a new song that keeps the sort of circuitous ache that made their early songs so enduring but beefs it up with a driving energy. The song is an excavation of a relationship that was built on a false foundation, and Reynolds' words are tragic and precise: “You were my light for so long/ Oceans deep and mountains tall/ Our future plays tricks on us, huh?” The track is a precursor to Kississippi's full-length debut that will be released next year. Listen to it below.
Cut Yr Teeth by kississippi
“Cut Yr Teeth” is out now via SideOneDummy.
Known for his presence in the Southern Americana scene — in Justin Vernon's pre-Bon Iver band DeYarmond Edison, as a member of North Carolina's freak-folk band Megafaun, as a sideman in Hiss Golden Messenger, etc. — Phil Cook has also carved out a nice little solo career for himself in recent years. We were fans of his debut LP Southland Mission, and he has a new one called PEOPLE ARE MY DRUG on the way.
On a yearning new single from that release, Cook partners with another leading light from his scene, Sylvan Esso and Mountain Man's Amelia Meath, for an honest track about emotional distance despite physical proximity. “Miles Away” is a bluesy tune filled with a soft, cathartic charm reminiscent of the Wood Brothers. Cook's voice is soothing and soulful over the bass' swinging groove; as he backs up Meath's ethereal voice, he falls into a peaceful whisper. The song's chilled-out sound and twinkling guitar are fully capable of swaying you to sleep.
The power on “Miles Away” derives from warmth in sadness. Even with searching lyrics like “I'm out here waiting/ Where could you be?” there's still a binding feeling of hope. The two drifters will reunite one day. Listen below.

As musical theater performers go, you couldn't ask for a more personable fellow than Andy Karl. His high-energy athleticism kept “Rocky” on its toes. And his comic chops earned him plenty of notice in “On the Twentieth Century.” Now, in “Groundhog Day,” he proves he can carry an entire show on his back — even after injuring himself during a late preview. (He bounded back for opening night.)
Danny Rubin scored a winner with his screenplay for the fondly remembered 1993 movie “Groundhog Day” starring Bill Murray as Phil Connors, an insufferable TV weatherman who only discovers his humanity after spending a lifetime re-living a single day in his sorry life. In the musical book Rubin adapted from his own screenplay, he softens the character's repellent nature, while still leaving him room to learn how to be human.
The rest is up to Andy Karl, who faithfully delivers the lines that let us know Phil is a jerk. In “Small Town, USA,” composer-lyricist Tim Minchin lets Phil vent his snobby contempt for country burgs like Punxsutawney, PA, and the dumb “hicks” who live there. As the song goes: “Small towns, tiny minds / Big mouths, small ideas.” But even when he's sneering at this one-horse town (where the one store on Main Street has an inventory heavy on plaid shirts and fishing tackle), Karl seems constitutionally incapable of showing us his bad side; if, indeed, this affable thesp even has a bad side.
We get that message in the first scene at the TV studio where weatherman Phil Connors (Karl) is taping his last show before heading for the Pennsylvania boondocks to cover the annual appearance of the celebrity groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil. “Will he see his shadow? Won't he?” Phil asks. “Civilization once again hangs in the balance,” he sarcastically adds.
Phil clearly has no use for the cute seasonal features that his job periodically entails. But there's not a trace of Murray's withering scorn in Karl's cheerfully wry delivery. And while Phil's experiences in rural America are life-changing, they are still a far cry from the dark night of the soul that his character endures in the movie.
Under Matthew Warchus's helming, Phil's adventures in Punxsutawney are like Alice's adventures in Wonderland — fantastical and fun. Rob Howell's set designs and Paul Kieve's illusions rely on amusing optical illusions like miniature car chases and teeny-tiny houses that curl around the proscenium. These funny folk even build a sort-of functional truck on stage.
When Phil and his producer (and love interest) Rita Hanson (Barrett Doss) first arrive in Punxsutawney, they're greeted by a parade of local characters, including some goofus in a groundhog suit, singing some dumb song about the inevitability of spring, whatever the groundhog predicts. As the show goes on, Tim Minchin's lyrics turn out to be much cleverer than this introductory number would indicate. Unfortunately, his music lacks a distinctive sound and doesn't rise above monotony, not even in the song that (so help me!) involves an enema.
Karl's charismatic perf and Warchus's inventive staging are in the service of a book by Danny Rubin, who wrote the original screenplay about how Phil is forced to relive Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney until he learns to care about other people. Although the story holds up, it doesn't entirely make sense here, given Phil's nice-guy persona and the absence of a redemption number to signify his transformation into an even-nicer guy.
Dongsanqi village is the latest community to be demolished under a municipal campaign to dismantle what the city authority says are unsafe dwellings following years of "disorderly" development.
Intel Corp chief executive officer Brian Krzanich has become the third business leader to resign from Donald Trump's manufacturing council.
The chief executives of Intel Corp , Merck & Co Inc and Under Armour Inc have now resigned from US President Donald Trump's American Manufacturing Council, following Trump's initially tepid response to weekend violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.
"I resigned from the council to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues...," Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a blog post on Tuesday.
Kenneth Fraizer, the chief executive of drugmaker Merck and an African-American, said he left the advisory council because of the president's reaction after the violence between white supremacists and counterprotesters. Frazier cited the need to "take a stand against intolerance and extremism."
The AFL-CIO, a federation of labour unions that represent 12.5 million workers, said it was considering pulling its representative on the committee.
After the white nationalist rally turned deadly on Saturday, Trump initially said that many sides were to blame. On Monday, in a statement, Trump denounced neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan as criminals and thugs, bowing to mounting political pressure as critics assailed him for not singling out white supremacists.
The CEO of Under Armour, Kevin Plank, announced his resignation from the council in a Twitter posting. "We remain resolute in our potential and ability to improve American manufacturing," said Plank. "However, Under Armour engages in innovation and sports, not politics."
Plank was criticised last winter by some of Under Armour's biggest stars over his support of Trump, comments that basketball star Stephen Curry echoed.
The demonstration in Charlottesville by hundreds of white nationalists took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car ploughed into a group of counterprotesters and killed one person.
"America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal," Frazier said in a statement announcing his resignation.
"As CEO of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism," he said.
Trump responded shortly later in a tweet, saying, "Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!"
The chief of South Korea's spy agency on Wednesday confirmed that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother was murdered with poison in Malaysia.
National Intelligence Service Director Lee Byong-ho told lawmakers that for the past five years Pyongyang has been attempting to assassinate Kim Jong-nam, who was under the protection of the Chinese government.
People watch a TV broadcast announcing the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother Kim Jong-nam, at Seoul Station on Feb. 15, 2017. A press statement released by the Malaysian police on Feb. 14 said a 46-year-old North Korean named Kim Chol died the previous day on his way to a hospital from a Malaysia International Airport service counter where he sought initial medical treatment. Reports said Kim Chol, an alias used by Kim Jong-nam, was attacked by two unidentified women with chemical spray. (Yonhap)
During a meeting with the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee, Lee confirmed that Kim was killed with poison at the airport, although it still needs to find out whether a needle or chemical spray was used. The agency conceded it was notified of the incident about four hours after it occurred.Kim was at the airport to take an airplane heading to Macao when he asked the staff for help after interacting with two "Asian" women. Kim died on the way to a nearby hospital.The Malaysian authorities presume Kim was poisoned, although details will be revealed through an autopsy. The agency said the suspects are presumed to be still at large in Malaysia."There was also an (assassination attempt) in 2012," Lee was quoted as saying by Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the Democratic Party.Lee then said the North's latest action is presumed to have been based on Kim Jong-un's "delusional disorder," rather than on any calculation that his half brother is a threat to the regime.The NIS head also told lawmakers that Kim sent a letter to the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in 2012, asking his brother to spare his and the lives of his family.Kim Jong-nam's wife is currently staying in Beijing with a son, while his second wife is living in Macao with a son and a daughter.All of them are currently under the protection of Chinese authorities.The son in Macao is Kim Han-sol, who came into the spotlight in 2012 after being interviewed by a Finnish television station. He said he hopes for the unification of the two divided Koreas and wants to improve the livelihoods of ordinary people living in the impoverished country now controlled by his young uncle.The agency said Kim has never asked South Korea for asylum, nor was there an effort within North Korea to place Kim Jong-nam as the leader.South Korea's unification ministry also said it is certain that Kim has been killed in Malaysia."Police in Malaysia are conducting a probe into the killing, and they have yet to announce the results (of the investigation)," Jeong Joon-hee, spokesman at Seoul's unification ministry said."Seoul is closely cooperating with the Malaysian government."Experts said that Kim might have been killed due to the North Korean leader's move to strengthen his reign of terror by eliminating any potential rivals to his iron-fist rule.Kim Jong-nam -- the eldest son of late former leader Kim Jong-il -- had been living in foreign countries for years after apparently falling out of favor with his father for attempting to enter Japan with a fake passport in 2001.He was critical of the power succession to his brother Kim Jong-un. In 2010, Kim Jong-nam told Japan's TV Asahi that he is "against third-generation succession," although he said he hopes Kim Jong-un will do his best to improve the lives of North Koreans and that he stands ready to help from abroad.It marks the highest-profile death under the Kim Jong-un regime since the execution of Jang Song-thaek in December 2013, the once-powerful uncle of the incumbent leader.Since inheriting power from his father Kim Jong-il in late 2011, the North's young leader has propped up his control by executing more than 100 military, party and government officials, according to Seoul's spy agency.Japan's Kyodo News, meanwhile, said that authorities in Tokyo are checking reports that the two suspected assailants may have died.South Korea police said it has increased the number of officers protecting high-ranking North Korean defectors in the country."We have added more forces to the team since Tuesday night amid the rising concerns over the safety of many important defectors," an official from the police said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Manchester City beat Manchester United 2-1 at Old Trafford to go 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League on Sunday while Liverpool and Everton drew 1-1 in a snowswept Merseyside derby at Anfield.

City's victory marked the first time a team have won 14 consecutive English top-flight games in the same season and ended United's run of 40 home games unbeaten in all competitions.
Pep Guardiola's side took the lead in the 43rd minute through David Silva but poor defending allowed United to hit back immediately with Marcus Rashford grabbing an equaliser before the break.
Nicolas Otamendi volleyed in the winner on the half-turn nine minutes into the second half.
City now have 46 points from 16 games, with United staying second on 35, and look like the title is theirs to lose even if Guardiola was not about to get carried away.
“We won because we were better. We are still in December, if we have 11 points (lead) when we play the second derby in April then maybe I will tell you that we have the title,” said the Spaniard.
Champions Chelsea, who lost 1-0 at relegation-threatened West Ham United on Saturday, are third on 32 points with Liverpool squandering a chance to overtake them and staying fourth on 30.
Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp fumed after his side's draw, with Everton's former England captain Wayne Rooney equalising from the penalty spot after a sensational first-half goal by Mohamed Salah.
“The other team was not even in our box, I don't know if they had a shot on target apart from the penalty. To give them an open door like this, in my understanding, that's not okay,” said Klopp.
“There are greater catastrophes on this planet than getting a point after a game like this but it feels not too good,” added the German.
Salah's 42nd-minute stunner sent the Egyptian clear of Tottenham Hotspur's England striker Harry Kane as the league's top marksman with 13 goals. Kane had scored twice in a 5-1 victory over Stoke City on Saturday.

Rooney's goal was his first in a Merseyside derby, a match he last featured in almost 14 years ago before moving to Manchester United.
“It's always nice scoring against Liverpool, whoever you're playing for,” he said.
GIROUD STRIKES
In the day's early match, Southampton and Arsenal also drew 1-1 with Charlie Austin putting the hosts ahead in the third minute at St Mary's and Olivier Giroud heading in a late equaliser after coming on as a second-half substitute.

It was the 17th time Giroud had scored as a substitute for Arsenal, equalling Norwegian Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's record with Manchester United for most goals scored off the bench for a single club.
City dominated possession at Old Trafford, showing they have grit as well as class even if the performance was not a classic display of the manager's attractive passing football.
Jose Mourinho's team selection had suggested a more expansive approach, with Anthony Martial and Rashford supporting central striker Romelu Lukaku, but the Portuguese was left with a bitter taste.
“It is a significant distance,” he said of City's lead, before being asked if his team could make it up.
“I don't know. I know we can win next Wednesday (against Bournemouth).”
Like Klopp, Mourinho was also upset with the referee -- in this case for not awarding a penalty to his side in the 79th minute when Ander Herrera went down in the box under pressure from Otamendi.
“My first reaction is I feel sorry for referee Michael Oliver because he had a very good match but unfortunately he made an important mistake,” he said.
“The result was made with a big penalty not given... Michael was unlucky because it was a clear penalty.”
WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday banned the export of weapons and defense services to South Sudan, stepping up pressure against President Salva Kiir to end the country's four-year conflict.
“The Department of State today announces that it is implementing restrictions on the export of defense articles and defense services into South Sudan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
While the United States government does not conduct arms sales to South Sudan, the move prevents any American company or citizen from sending military equipment or services to the country's warring factions.
The unilateral embargo is another signal by Washington that it is losing patience with Kiir after ceasefires have been repeatedly violated. (Reporting by Lesley Wroughton Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - The United Nations' relationship with Nigeria is intact, a U.N. official said on Saturday, despite a military raid on a compound belonging to the international body in the conflict-ridden northeast.
"I am very pleased to report that our relationship of collaboration and trust is intact," Peter Lundberg, the U.N. deputy humanitarian coordinator for Nigeria, said at a briefing in the northeastern city of Maiduguri.
Friday's raid had threatened to undermine an already-rocky relationship between Nigeria's military and the United Nations and other aid organisations.
The army said it was a search for members of Islamist insurgency Boko Haram in Maiduguri, the epicentre of the fight against the militants, in an area of the city that included the U.N. compound.
The army and United Nations still disagree over whether the compound was registered and designated as belonging to the U.N.
A worsening of relations between the U.N. and Nigeria could risk destabilising efforts to deliver aid to almost seven million people affected by the eight-year conflict with Boko Haram, one of the biggest humanitarian crises in the world.
The United Nations on Friday had halted various operations around the northeast, but following reassurances from Nigeria those resumed on Saturday, said Lundberg.
The insurgency has driven at least two million people from their homes, left tens of thousands on the brink of famine and millions more without secure access to food.
"We are here in support of the government of Nigeria, the United Nations agencies and over 60 non-government organisations," said Lundberg.
In a separate statement, Ibrahim Attahiru, a commander of Nigeria's operations against Boko Haram, said the army was not trying to block the United Nations' activities.
"We will continue to collaborate with the United Nations humanitarian agencies to achieve the goals of the counter-insurgency campaign and other developments to address the humanitarian crisis in the northeast region," he said.
It only took 20 years for Brie Larson to become an overnight success.
The Oscar-winning star of the drama Room and the future Captain Marvel herself has been acting since she was a child.
At age six, the Sacramento native became the youngest student ever to attend the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco.
Acting in childhood, Larson says, “Was a playground for me to be able to express all these things that were confusing to me, or things I wanted to know more about, to try on different people, different ways of doing things."
The self-described shy child began her career in television. She made her film debut in the 1999 movie, Special Delivery, and appeared in such films as 13 Going on 30, Sleepover and Hoot, graduating to roles in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, 21 Jump Street, Rampart and The Spectacular Now; on television, she starred in the United States of Tara, among other projects.
In 2013, Larson, 27, was in two films — Don Jon and Short Term 12 — that brought her critical attention. Trainwreck and Room made 2015 a ‘breakout' year for the young actress, and she is currently in theatres starring in Kong: Skull Island.
Later this year, Larson will make her feature directorial debut with Unicorn Store; she also stars in the movie alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Joan Cusack and Bradley Whitford.
This week, Larson's new movie, Free Fire, opens in theatres. The blackly comic crime caper from director Ben Wheatley (Kill List) is a shoot ‘em up about a small arms deal gone wrong; Larson stars in Free Fire with Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley, Cillian Murphy and Noah Taylor.
Martin Scorsese is the executive producer.
We spoke to Brie Larson when she was at the Toronto International film festival to promote Free Fire.
Had you encountered director Ben Wheatley in the past?
“I had watched his films. You hear good things from other actors.”
Wheatley has said the game Counter Strike was one source of inspiration for Free Fire.
“It did feel like a long game of Laser Tag. [Laughs]. It's really entertaining, but there's a lot more going on under the surface.”
And it was shot in Brighton. You must be travelling the world these days?
“That's just how it goes. At least it's usually a couple of months in one spot, which is usually enough to get a handle on a place. I'm grateful for that. And I love the fact I've worked in so many places. But we're always constantly moving around, so that's why certain moments, like a banquet or a gala or an awards' ceremony, when you see someone again, it's an amazing chance! It's like a reunion because you run into so many people. Recently I was shooting in Montreal and Jen Lawrence was shooting at the same time and it was incredible that we got to spend weekends together. We were like, ‘How could we be so lucky?' You get so used to being on your own, and exploring a new place and meeting new people all the time, so it's such a treat when there's a friend there.”
Can we talk about change in your life? A year ago you were here to promote Room, and now you have an Oscar for that movie. And a huge public profile.
“I think it's kind of a typical thing — a year later, so much has changed and so much has stayed the same. A lot of things about my public persona have changed, in that more people know what my face looks like, but all of the intimate details — like my private life, the friends I have, how I take my coffee — that's all the same. It's an intriguing experience being back here after a year, because I'm the same, but I've noticed that my public perception has changed.”
That public perception is going to change again with your Captain Marvel role, right?
"That wasn't my motivation for doing it. I have very specific reasons for doing film, and they don't have to do with me, or getting my face plastered on more objects. It's about the material. And movies live on and can be places I can't, and I want to be conscious about what that is that I'm presenting to the world. And what those representations of life are, and how they're being shared. And obviously, Marvel is such an incredible platform to be able to share in storytelling, and I think that what Captain Marvel represents, and what this film is shaping up to be, has a message that's undeniably important to the world right now.”
How do you feel about this sudden flood of attention on you?
“I'm a pretty private person; so much of my day-to-day is much the same. The beauty of being a 20-year overnight success is that I've had a lot of time to have a clear understanding of what I'm interested in and why it fills me up. This job can be really draining on one side, because it's a lot of giving. You're giving emotionally when you're playing a character, you're giving emotionally when you're doing interviews, when you're meeting with fans. It's an act of service. You have to find a way to balance it up with things that are for yourself, that fill you back up again. I feel like I'm still learning about that balance, because the output is more than what it was. But my overall life is the same. I'm in the same body I was always in.”
Is this film festival in Toronto different for you now?
“This TIFF experience is bizarre. [Laughs] It's like, a year ago I could walk around anywhere and nobody cared what I was doing. That's a weird, sort of, out-of-body experience now that I'm the same, but everyone around me has sort of changed. But it's wonderful! I'm so incredibly grateful for this last year and for what TIFF has brought into my life.”

REMEMBER THIS?
Brie Larson is such a chameleon that you've likely seen her in more than a few films without even realizing it.
Here are five Brie Larson movies you forgot she was in:
RIGHT ON TRACK (2003)
In this made for TV Disney movie, baby-faced Larson and Beverley Mitchell starred as Courtney and Erica Enders, real-life drag-racing sisters who challenged a male dominated sport and won.
HOOT (2006)
Larson and Logan Lerman star as dedicated kids trying to protect an endangered species of owl from a massive construction project. Luke Wilson plays a cop; also with Tim Blake Nelson, Cody Linley.
TANNER HALL (2009)
This is cheating, because the movie was never really released into theatres. But still — here's Larson starring with Rooney Mara, Amy Seders and Tom Everett Scott in a coming of age (and sexual awakening) drama about a girls' boarding school.
21 JUMP STREET (2012)
How could you forget? In this comedy about two moronic young cops sent to work undercover in a high school, Larson plays Jonah Hill's adorable love interest.
THE GAMBLER (2014)
Larson is the spunky love interest opposite Mark Wahlberg in the story of a literature professor leading a double life — as a gambling addict. Larson plays one of Wahlberg's students, but she also works part-time in a casino, so she knows both sides of his story. Drama also stars Jessica Lange and John Goodman.

Slate has published a report offering surprisingly compelling evidence that Bob Dylan referenced and outright quoted passages from the Spark Notes for Moby Dick in his recent literature-focused Nobel Prize Lecture without citation. One might think that Dylan's general, freeform explanations of many of the main characters and boilerplate themes of Herman Melville's novel could just coincidentally overlap with Spark Notes' simply-worded, overarching summaries. However, as Slate shows, there are specific similarities in the language used by Dylan and Spark Notes, using phrases that are not included in the novel, that seem much to close to be coincidental, especially considering that the lecture came from the collage-and-quotation king of rock music.
One notable example of this comes when comparing a passage from Spark Notes' broad-stroke “Summary” of Meville's plot to Dylan's text. Here's Spark Notes:
“Captain Boomer has lost an arm in an encounter with Moby Dick. … Boomer, happy simply to have survived his encounter, cannot understand Ahab's lust for vengeance.”
Here's Dylan:
“Captain Boomer — he lost an arm to Moby. But … he's happy to have survived. He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance.”
The fairly specific phrase “lust for vengeance,” as Slate writer Andrea Pitzer points out, is not in the novel.
The shared description of the character Gabriel is also convincing: Spark Notes (in the same “Summary” section as the “vengeance” passage) refer to him as a “crazed prophet,” while Dylan called the character a “crazy prophet.” Neither is a Melville description, nor is that phrasing used in any other text I could readily find accounted for on the Internet. Here's Spark Notes: “One of the ships … carries Gabriel, a crazed prophet who predicts doom for anyone who threatens Moby Dick.” Here's Dylan: “There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom.”
Another character description of Stubb, stated by both Dylan and the Spark Notes team (on their “Characters” summary page), is that Stubb assigns no or little “significance to anything.” This is also not from the novel.
Pitzer's report offers 11 examples of similar passages, many of which do not involve quotations from the novel. You can check out an infographic with side-by-side comparisons and more information at Slate's website. Dylan delivered the lecture, which he offered as a recording rather than delivering live, shortly before the deadline he had been given to do so. Listen to the speech, which lightly mocks the fact that his work is even being considered “literature” in the first place in its conclusion, below.
This article originally appeared on Spin.
“It: Chapter 2” will be even more scary than last year's horror blockbuster, director Andy Muschietti promised Tuesday.
“Bring your adult diapers,” he told the audience at Caesar's Palace in a video clip on the second day of the CinemaCon convention of the nation's theater owners during the Warner Bros. presentation.
Though the studio showed no footage of the sequel, which has not begun shooting yet, it screened plenty of scenes from the original — which stunned the movie world with a $700 million worldwide gross. The sequel was dated a week later.
Stephen King's 1986 novel focuses on a group of friends in a fictional Maine community that battles the small town's demon as children, and then again as adults. The blockbuster movie centered on the children, while the upcoming film will follow them into adulthood.
Warner Bros. also highlighted its horror film “The Nun,” a spinoff movie based on the demonic character in “The Conjuring 2.” Producers are James Wan, who directed the two “Conjuring” movies and produced the sequel, and Peter Safran, who produced both movies. The current script for “The Nun” is written by Gary Dauberman and Wan.
A huge fire engulfed a tower block in west London this Wednesday morning leaving more than 50 people injured and an unknown number of people dead. Police haven't confirmed the exact number.
Grenfell Tower, the 24-storey block, burned for more than 6 hours while 200 hundred firefighters battled to rescue residents from their flats.
A resident sent me this video they took when they escaped the building around 1:30 am pic.twitter.com/WdNMQpa2Mv Advertisement — AssedBaig (@AssedBaig) June 14, 2017
Eye witnesses have told of residents screaming for help, building ropes from sheets and lean out windows.
Dany Cotton London fire commissioner confirmed there was a "number of fatalities', but an exact number could not yet be confirmed due to the size and complexity of the emergency.
The cause of the blaze remains unknown. A baby was caught by a member of the public after being dropped from the window on the 10th floor, a witness told The Guardian.

Protestors made some noise this morning in downtown Des Moines, outside a Wells Fargo stockholders meeting.
The protesters are blasting the bank over its business practices. Federal regulators recently slapped the bank with a $1 billion fine for loan abuses. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan apologized in a video statement released last October.
“I am deeply sorry for the unacceptable sales practices in our retail bank and other mistakes that we've made. There is simply no excuse for what happened,” Sloan said. He echoed those remarks this morning. Sloan told investors that rebuilding trust is the company's top priority. The protestors are calling for Wells Fargo to fire Sloan and the company's entire board of directors.
In Iowa alone, Wells Fargo has around 16,000 employees.
The night before the murders, he said, he went to see Culleton, who he claims to have dated, at her cottage on Kamaniskeg Lake, where he said she and her new boyfriend laughed at him.
Then he returned to his home, about 24 kilometres away in Palmer Rapids, Ont., and drank rye with a neighbour while they discussed the Bible, before falling asleep on the couch.
The next morning, he borrowed a friend's car, stopped for gas and then drove back to Culleton's cottage.
"I remember thinking that God is really helping me because when I went to Carol's, Carol walked right outside," he says, so quietly it is at times difficult to hear, with long pauses between sentences.
"And then I asked her, I said, 'Why do you hate me, why are you doing this to me?' And then she closed the door, I was right there, and then I broke the window with my elbow and I reached in and I unlocked the door. And she said, 'This isn't you, Basil, this is not you'."
He said Culleton then told him a man was coming over to fix the electricity and he told her she was lying.
"There was a, a cable, a TV coil, I picked it up and I hit her with it and I wrapped it around her head. She just kept saying 'this is not you Basil, this is not you.' And then, then I walked around the cottage."
He said he found her purse and took her keys and phone and car. He threw the phone out the window as he drove so nobody could see the text message conversation they'd had.
He drove to Kuzyk's house, about 20 kilometres away in Wilno, Ont., and she too walked outside before going back into her home after seeing him. He followed.
"I asked Anastasia 'why did you lie in court?' and she said 'I didn't,' and the gun went off. Because it's just lying."
He said God then told him to get back in the car so he did and drove to Warmerdam's home, about 30 kilometres west in Cormac, Ont.
"What happened? I just drove in, walked in the door, she was sitting there, she went around the corner, I followed her. Boom. That was it and I walked out. It was funny, like I wasn't even pulling the trigger on the gun, the gun was just going off. Boop."
Borutski at one point said the Bible makes a distinction between killing and murder and only murder is wrong because it is taking the life of someone who is innocent. That's why, he said, he didn't shoot himself that day, because it would have been like murdering himself.
He said that throughout much of the day he experienced an out-of-body experience and described himself repeatedly as a "zombie."
The trial resumes Tuesday.

Poland's police says they have arrested a Nigerian man who is wanted by Interpol and FBI in the United States for alleged cyberfraud and extortion done over the internet totaling an estimated $7 million.
An elite group from the Polish police's Central Bureau Investigation (CB?P) said in a communique on Wednesday, that the 27-year-old Nigerian was tracked down in the southwestern city of Wroclaw, as a result of cooperation with the FBI and Interpol, which had circulated a warrant for the man.
The police raid took him by surprise, the communique said. The man is suspected of banking fraud, extortion and theft of online banking access data as well as an identity theft. He remains under arrest pending extradition to the United States, where he faces up to 30 years in prison.

Europe's elite learned their Champions League last-16 fate on Monday as a number of very tasty ties were announced.
Favourites Paris Saint-Germain were drawn against last season's competition winners Real Madrid - the tie of the round.
While Chelsea were drawn against their age-old nemesis Barcelona. Elsewhere Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool were given favourable ties against Sevilla, Basel and Porto respectively.
Here are five things we cannot wait to discover following the draw.
(Image: AFP)
Neymar vs Ronaldo - who will prevail?
Many football fans were probably hoping these two European titans would meet in the later stages of the competition.
But they've be drawn together in the round of 16, so expect fireworks.
The obvious sub-plot from the tie sees recent Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo go head to head with the world's most expensive player, Neymar.
(Image: AFP)
The pair - widely considered two of the best players on the planet, and two players happy to revel in the limelight - will be gunning for superiority.
And with the narrative that Neymar could one day move to Real Madrid lingering in the background, it will be interesting to see which man prevails.
Barcelona vs Chelsea - who wins this rivalry?
Over the years Barcelona and Chelsea have taken part in some very feisty matches, which have produced some moments of magic.
For the most part the south-west London team have prevailed against the Catalan giants.
They certainly did when the two teams were drawn against each other in the 2012 semi-final, the year Chelsea won the competition for the first time in their club's history, and also the last time the two teams came face to face.
(Image: AFP)
But their 2009 semi-final lives long in the memory of Chelsea fans after they were knocked out by the away goal rule thanks to a very late strike from Andres Iniesta.
The game, which was marred by many controversial refereeing decisions, descended into chaos as the final whistle blew, and you can expect a lively atmosphere when the two sides meet in this year's competition.
How far can Tottenham go?
Last season Tottenham had a Champions League campaign to forget as they failed to get out of their group, but this year they go into the last 16 having accumulated more points than any other team.
Most impressively they also beat Real Madrid to top Group H and were part of the reason Bundesliga giants Dortmund will be playing in the Europa League.
But Spurs have drawn one of the harder teams available in Juventus, who finished second in Group D just behind Barcelona.

They'll have to be at their very best if they are to prevail against last season's runners-up and match their greatest ever Champions League finish - a spot in the quarter-final.
After all Juventus, who have been eliminated in each of their last five knockout ties with English teams in Europe, will want to finally get one over a Premier League outfit.
Pep Guardiola vs Basel - time for revenge?
Back in 2008 Pep Guardiola, who was relatively new to the whole management thing, embarked upon his first Champions League campaign as Barcelona boss.
His Catalan giants were drawn Basel in Group C and well and truly thumped them 5-0 in their first match against the Swiss outfit.
Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, Bojan (2) and Xavi were on the scoresheet on the day as Barcelona took their opposition to the sword.
(Image: Reuters)
Guardiola's Manchester City team are more than capable of inflicting a similar level of punishment on Raphael Wicky's side.
But the Swiss club will be well aware of how the Spaniard embarrassed them some 10 years ago, and will be determined to offer a little more this time round.
Can Man United and Liverpool do their ties justice?
Manchester United and Liverpool fans were likely unified when they discovered that their teams had drawn Sevilla and Porto respectively.
While both clubs are good in their own right, they are kinder than some of the other names that could have been pulled out of the hat.
So what now? Two easy wins for the Premier League teams, and spots booked in the quarter-final of the competition, right?
(Image: REUTERS)
Things are never this easy, especially in Europe - and both clubs would do well to remember this going into the game.
Liverpool were punished by complacency last time out in their 1-1 draw with Everton, while Manchester United have also shown they can be upstaged by a supposed minnow - Huddersfield proved this to be true this season.
Also, when do these ties ever follow the script?
KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Inspired by the mobile game Pokémon Go, campaigners in the Philippines are using a smartphone app to send users to locations with condom dispensers in a bid to promote safe sex and break stigma to fight a worsening HIV epidemic.
The Philippines has registered the fastest-growing HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia-Pacific, according to the United Nations, with a 140-percent jump in new infections over six years from 2010 and young gay men and transgender women most at-risk.
To tackle low condom use, activists have teamed up with restaurants and shops to set up dispensers with free condoms in the capital Manila which users can locate through an app.
Led by Save the Children and campaign group LoveYourself, which promotes HIV awareness, the Safe Spaces project has set up 30 dispensers in Manila so far and aims to expand to 150 locations across the country this year.
“It's like Pokémon Go when you run out of Poke Balls, you need to refill at a nearby station. At Safe Spaces, you can see the nearest stations where you can access free condoms,” LoveYourself founder Ronivin Pagtakhan said.
“This is an innovation, it has never been done before. Now people can access condoms safely and without stigma,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Manila.
The Philippines in recent years has seen rising incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can leads to AIDS, although the rate has fallen in other parts of the world.
Most cases were transmitted through sexual contact and two out of three new HIV infections were among 15 to 24-year-old men, according to Philippine officials.
Philippines researcher Carlos Conde from Human Rights Watch - which is not involved in the project - said advocating condom use and sex education are keys to fight HIV but the Philippine government has “failed miserably” to do so in the mainly Catholic nation.
“The main hurdle has been the lack of political will to resist the deeply rooted opposition to these measures,” he said in a statement on Friday.
In another attempt to fight the epidemic, a group of HIV-negative gay men and transgender women started to take anti-HIV drugs last year under a two-year pilot project.
The daily pill, known as PrEP, is designed to protect the body pre-exposure, rather than after HIV spreads.

For years, abortion-rights advocates have used the First Amendment as a weapon to challenge laws that require doctors to display an ultrasound or describe a fetus in detail to a patient.
Now its the anti-abortion side that says its speech rights are being violated.
The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Tuesday on a California law that forces licensed pregnancy-counseling clinics that promote childbirth as an alternative to tell patients they might be eligible for free or discounted abortions. Pregnancy centers say they are being compelled to advertise a procedure they abhor.
The government cannot gerrymander a law to target disfavored speakers, and it cannot require Americans to promote messages that violate their convictions, said Kristen Waggoner, an Alliance Defending Freedom lawyer who represents the centers.

In a Supreme Court term without any cases that involve direct regulations on abortion, the case has become a proxy for the broader fight over the divisive issue. Abortion-rights groups say the California law helps keep fake womens health centers from misleading vulnerable patients about their options. (Continued below.)

Deceiving and manipulating pregnant women is not a free speech right, said Nancy Northup, chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights.
Under the measure, which took effect in 2016, licensed pregnancy centers must tell patients they can call a county health department to learn about state-funded prenatal, family planning and abortion services.
The law imposes separate requirements on centers that arent licensed as medical facilities but still offer pregnancy testing or ultrasound imaging. Those centers must post prominent notices on-site and in any advertisements to say they dont have a medical professional on staff.
The challengers include the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a nonprofit organization that says it represents more than 110 pro-life pregnancy centers in California and more than 1,400 around the country. Two San Diego-area clinics are also pressing the case.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that abortion doctors could be required to provide a variety of information to women, including a list of agencies that offer adoption services and information about the child-support obligations of the father. That holding was part of the Planned Parenthood v. Casey ruling, better known for upholding the core right to abortion.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra says that reasoning should lead the court to uphold the states disclosure requirements. The Pennsylvania law upheld in Casey required doctors to provide state-prepared publications containing extensive state messages, he said in court papers.
The California measure, by contrast, requires only a two-sentence notice that services are available to eligible women through public programs and that a county office can provide more information if it is desired, Becerra wrote.
The centers and their supporters say the California law is fundamentally different from the type of informed-consent requirements upheld in Casey.
Californias law has nothing to do with giving patient information to assess the risks and consequences of a procedure a doctor in a certain medical facility is about to perform, a Texas-led group of more than 20 states said in court papers.
The Trump administration is taking a middle ground in the case, urging the court to strike down the requirements for licensed centers but to uphold the rules for unlicensed centers.
The latter provision merely requires service providers to disclose an accurate, uncontroversial fact about their own services: that they are not provided by a state-licensed medical professional, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued.
The centers say the rules are onerous, demanding the use of 48-point type and potentially requiring statements in 13 languages.
It forecloses a number of communications channels completely for these centers, Waggoner said.
The justices will rule by June. The case is National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra, 16-1140.
Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump
On Wednesday afternoon, Kim Kardashian met with Donald Trump at the White House. They didn't chat about their mutual love for Kanye West, instead discussing the serious topics of criminal justice and prison reform.
Specifically, Kardashian talked about Trump possibly granting clemency to Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old nonviolent drug offender currently serving a life sentence behind bars. Kardashian was moved by Johnson's story, which was featured in a Mic.com profile last October and detailed all the ways her punishment did not fit her crime. “This is so unfair,” Kardashian tweeted at the time, alongside a link to the lengthy write-up.
Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you 🙏🏼✨ — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018
Prior to arriving at the White House, Kardashian wrote on Twitter: “Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you.” As Yahoo points out, Johnson is one of the whopping 39% of the prison population that is serving time for nonviolent offenses — despite the fact that they'd likely benefit from alternative rehabilitative options.
In addition to Trump, Kardashian met with Jared Kushner. She had reportedly spoken to the adviser “several times” in the past about Johnson's sentence.
Along with the general randomness of this meeting, lest we not forget all the times Trump has hurled misogynistic comments Kardashian's way. In a 2013 interview (via The Daily Beast), he criticized that she “absolutely” had “a fat ass.” “It's record setting,” he commented again to Howard Stern about a year later. “In the old days, they'd say she's got a bad body.”
Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. pic.twitter.com/uOy4UJ41JF — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018
Say what you will about the Kardashian family and their reality show dynasty, but it says a lot about Kim and her priorities that she insists on meeting with someone who has repeatedly disrespected and put her down in the public eye.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Monday as investors prepared for an expected Federal Reserve rate hike later in the week, while stocks rose around the world on continued solid global economic growth indicators.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 opened flat after news of an explosion in New York's busy Port Authority commuter hub which New York Mayor Bill de Blasio described as an “attempted terrorist attack.”
U.S. stocks edged higher after worries receded over the explosion.
“The market makes an assessment almost immediately as soon as new information comes in, and this is what you're seeing,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in New Jersey. “You're seeing the equity market move higher and the Treasury yields climb just a bit.”

Gains in the energy .SPNY and technology .SPLRCT indexes helped boost Wall Street. CenturyLink (CTL.N) rose 8.18 percent after the telecom provider signed a 5-year contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.38 percent.
“There's somewhat of an enthusiasm that global growth is more synchronized than it's been in a long time, and it's synchronized in the right direction,” said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.
MSCI's emerging market stock index .MSCIEF rose 0.83 percent. Its broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.81 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.56 percent.

The Iowa Department of Public Health was happy to find the state in the minority following a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the number of deaths from strokes nationwide.
DPH Health Systems Coordinator Terry Meek says the numbers in most states increased or held steady in the report — but not here. “Iowa is one of 13 states where we have actually continue decreasing the number of deaths due to stroke,” Meek explains. “Our rate has decreased 33 percent between 2005 and 2015.” Meek says the biggest factor in the Iowa's ability to lower stroke deaths is linked to money it received from the CDC.
“That funding was called the Coverdale Stroke Program. And what it did was give us some money where we were able to call together a lot of partners and really work on some targeted activities to decrease stroke deaths,” according to Meek. That targeted program included education that highlighted the signs and symptoms of a stroke, and encouraged people to immediately call 911 at the first signs of stroke.
“The reason for doing that is important because there is medication that usually can be given if people get there (the hospital) soon enough that will preclude some of the major problems with stroke,” she says. They also strengthened the stroke identification and care at the Comprehensive Stroke and Primary Stroke Centers in Iowa, along with changing the EMS protocols to include immediate transfer of stroke patients to the closest and highest level of stroke center.
“So more people were getting to those compressive and primary stroke centers in Iowa quicker,” Meek says. The quicker treatment and transports led to fewer deaths. Meek says the state also developed the Iowa Stroke Registry with the University of Iowa to help track what is going on. She says you can help continue to improve its stroke death rate in Iowa by taking steps to prevent strokes.
“Eating a healthy diet, watching their blood pressure, making sure that they have regular checkups with their physician, where the physician can check for cholesterol, high blood pressure and other things that may be a problem — including diabetes,” Meek says.
Meek says you can recognize the signs of stroke by remembering “F.A.S.T.”
Here's what it means:
Face — Ask the person to smile. Does one side droop?
Arms –Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downwards?
Speech – Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Are the words slurred?
Time — If the person shows any of these symptoms, call 911 immediately.

ESPN Buccaneers reporter Jenna Laine shares the players that Tampa Bay passed on to draft Roberto Aguayo in the second round of the 2016 draft. (1:28)
Tampa Bay Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht says his decision to release kicker Roberto Aguayo on Saturday was his way of owning up to the mistake he made in drafting Aguayo, but that won't stop him from making bold moves in the future.
Editor's Picks Roberto Aguayo proved to be a costly risk for Buccaneers In a few games he was all they had, but other times kicker Roberto Aguayo made it harder for the Bucs to win and mount a run at the playoffs.
Bears claim Aguayo one day after his release Roberto Aguayo will once again compete with Connor Barth for kicking duties -- only this time in Chicago. 1 Related
"I'm owning up to it," he told The MMQB.com. "I'm owning up to it by releasing him. It was a bold move and it didn't work out. I don't know what else to say. I know I have the support of my coach and my ownership.
"At the time, I was bound and determined to get the best kicker we possibly could. I thought Roberto had the chance to be a special kicker in the league for a long time. That's a position that had been a rough spot for us.
"What did I learn from this? I've said this before, but when we took him, we essentially anointed him. If I could do it again, I would have gone back and brought in competition to challenge him. I look back on that a lot. Roberto is a great kid, but the magnitude of that position, and the pressure on a 21-year-old -- his performance is affecting the lives of men who have families to support. That got tough."

The Buccaneers' move to trade into the second round of the 2016 draft to select Aguayo drew scrutiny from the start. Aguayo then scuffled in his rookie year, making just 71 percent (22-for-31) of his field goal attempts. He continued to scuffle in training camp with the final straw coming Friday night, when he missed an extra point and then missed wide right on a 47-yard field goal attempt against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Licht vowed in his interview with The MMQB.com that the experience with Aguayo will not make him "afraid of making bold moves" in the future.
"You can't make decisions, or not make them, based on fear. I will say that you have to learn from things that didn't work out. Whatever that is in this case, we'll figure it out," he told the website.
The Bears claimed Aguayo off waivers on Sunday, and he will compete with veteran Connor Barth for the team's starting job. Barth was released by the Buccaneers after they selected Aguayo in 2016.

TEENAGE prodigy Jack Walker wants to cement himself a place with Leeds Rhinos in 2018 – and knows Ashton Golding will challenge him all the way.
Full-back Walker became the youngest-ever Grand Final winner when – aged just 18 years and 60 days – he helped Leeds beat Castleford Tigers at Old Trafford in October.
Remarkably, it was only his 12th senior game but he handled the occasion with real class and maturity.
Walker was preferred to Golding, the club's other talented young full-back who – only 21 himself – had played most of the campaign for Brian McDermott's side. Both having signed long-term contracts at Headingley, it seems they will now be battling each other for the custodian role for some time.
Walker, who scored a hat-trick on debut in the Challenge Cup tie versus Doncaster in April, admitted: “Me and Ashton are good mates and we push each other.
“He's got things in his game that I need and I've got stuff in my game that he needs, so we'll just keep pushing each other.
RISING STAR: Leeds Rhinos' Ashton Golding
“When it comes to game day, you then just go out and do your best and it's up to Mac who gets the nod.
“My big thing for next year is mainly just to play as many games as possible and get as many as I can under my belt to develop my performances.
“I just want to get better really.”
On that historic Grand Final appearance when the ex-Oulton Raiders junior surpassed team-mate Stevie Ward's record – he was 18 years and 324 days when he helped Rhinos beat Warrington Wolves in the 2012 Grand Final – Walker recalled he was not perturbed by the whirlwind feel around it all.
Now I just want a big pre-season. I want to get faster, bigger and stronger, while my goal-line D (defence) is something I definitely want to improve. Leeds Rhinos' Jack Walker
“I just take everything as it is; for me every game is just another game,” he said. “Obviously it was a big occasion, the crowd and things like that, but I just went with it.
“Now I just want a big pre-season. I want to get faster, bigger and stronger, while my goal-line D (defence) is something I definitely want to improve.”
Walker admits he has been keeping a close eye recently on Australia legend Billy Slater, the illustrious veteran full-back who shone again in the World Cup.
“I grew up watching Danny McGuire and then recently Zak Hardaker,” he said. “I never really watched Australians.
“I knew Billy Slater and how good he was.
“It's only recently I've been watching how he plays and just trying to get little tips from him. He's a very good player.”
Walker, who thought about leaving his hometown club earlier this year before signing a new three-year deal in August, has played at half-back earlier in his fledgling career but does not see that as a long-term option.
“I've switched between full-back and half-back before,” said the player, who hopes to feature against Wakefield Trinity on Boxing Day. “It's not that I don't want to play half-back – I'd play anywhere for the team – but I feel I get the best out of myself from full-back.
“If they needed me to so I'd do the best I can.”
Peterborough charity Goldhay Arts has been working with nationally-acclaimed Eastern Angles Theatre Company to help make performing arts more accessible.
The Bretton-based charity specialises in providing activities for adults with learning difficulties.
Peterborough charity Goldhay Arts with nationally-acclaimed Eastern Angles
Participants aged between 19 and 73 from Goldhay Arts took part in a two-hour drama workshop funded by sponsors Ensors Accountants. The workshop took place on the set of Eastern Angles' latest production ‘The Ladykillers of Orton Brimbles' at the Key Theatre Studio.
Eastern Angles' Development Manager Karen Goddard said: “The group from Goldhay Arts were absolutely brilliant. They really got stuck in and loved getting on stage, taking part in various acting exercises and talking to our actors and production team. They learned a lot about how a theatre performance is created, and afterwards they loved watching the finished show.
“It's great to be able to make theatre that can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of age or disability. We hope to be working more with Goldhay Arts over the next few months.”
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian shares were under pressure on Wednesday, with a rise in U.S. bond yields above the 3 percent threshold and warnings from bellwether U.S. companies of higher costs driving fears that corporate earnings growth may peak soon.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dipped 0.1 percent while Japan's Nikkei .N225 dropped 0.6 percent.
Wall Street shares lost steam the previous day, with the S&P 500 .SPX falling 1.34 percent, the most in two-and-a-half weeks.
Caterpillar (CAT.N), an industrial heavyweight, beat earnings estimates due to strong global demand but its shares tumbled 6.2 percent after management said first-quarter earnings would be the “high watermark” for the year and warned of increasing steel prices.
“We've seen quite a lot of companies announcing above-estimate earnings and their shares falling sharply,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
Fujito noted major financial shares such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Citigroup (C.N) as well as Google parent Alphabet GOOG.N, the first major tech firm to report earnings, have followed a similar pattern.
“If shares are falling when corporate earnings are rising 20 percent and the economy is growing at 3 percent, the market is in trouble. The market reaction so far feels as if we are starting to see an end of its long rally since 2009. Investors could be thinking that the best time will be soon behind us,” he said.
Creeping gains in U.S. Treasury yields are fuelling fears. The 10-year yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, has been driven steadily higher by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply, and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield US10YT=RR rose to as high as 3.003 percent on Tuesday and last stood at 2.992 percent.
A break of its January 2014 high of 3.041 percent could turn investors even more bearish.
Fed Funds rate futures price <0#FF:> have been constantly falling this month, pricing in a considerable chance of three more rate hikes by the end of this year.
Rising U.S. rates underpinned the U.S. dollar in the currency market.
The euro stood at $1.2234 EUR=, not far from Tuesday's low of $1.2182, a low last seen on March 1.
The dollar traded at 108.83 yen JPY= after having jumped to a 2 1/2-month high of 109.20 yen on Tuesday.
Oil prices slipped back from near 3 1/2-year highs as the talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron eased concerns Washington may reinstate sanctions against Iran, although Trump refrained from committing to staying in a 2015 nuclear deal.
Brent LCOc1 fetched $74.02 a barrel, up 0.2 percent on the day. On Tuesday it rose to $75.47, its highest since November 2014. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 traded at $67.83, up 0.2 percent so far in Asia.
WTI's discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 widened to as much as $6.32, the most since Jan. 2, on rising U.S. production.

Football Soccer - Premier League - Everton vs Stoke City - Liverpool, Britain - August 12, 2017 Everton's Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring their first goal with teammates Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith
LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Everton manager Ronald Koeman said Wayne Rooney, who scored on his return to the club in the 1-0 win over Stoke on Saturday, was far from a spent force and showed exactly why he was the right signing for the club.
Rooney's move back to his boyhood club, after 13 successful years at Manchester United, divided opinion between those who viewed it as a welcome romantic return and those who felt he was not the right player for Koeman's new-look side.
But in his first Premier League outing Rooney not only scored the winner with a beautifully executed header from a Dominic Calvert-Lewin cross, but he also exuded quality and composure throughout.
"There was one player in an Everton shirt today who was, from the first second to the last, comfortable on the pitch," said the Dutch manager.
"He made every decision the right one and he scored a great goal from a great cross from Dominic.
"In difficult moments, he showed his experience. That is why we signed Wayne -- expecting to show his team-mates all that experience, and it was really important," he said.

Rooney last scored a goal for Everton at Goodison on March 13, 2004 when he claimed the winner against Portsmouth.
That gap of 4,869 days is the longest between goals for the same club in the Premier League. The header was his 300th involvement in a goal in the Premier League, with 101 assists to add to his 199 goals. Only Alan Shearer, with 324, has more.
And he joined Shearer and Frank Lampard with the most goals on the league's opening day - eight.
Koeman not only believes that Rooney fits perfectly into his plans at Everton, but he also thinks he is far from the faded force that many felt he was becoming at United.
"Wayne showed he is still one of the best players in his position and he showed today the player that we expected," said Koeman.
"A lot of cleverness on the pitch and a great goal and a great header. We can't ask for more than he showed today."

The provincial government is asking for public input on a $27-million provincial caribou recovery program, Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development announced on Friday.
“We have started the work on caribou recovery, but more needs to be done,” said Donaldson.
“The provincial caribou recovery program will consider ways to reduce threats to caribou, while balancing the needs of all British Columbians, including Indigenous communities, industry, recreation enthusiasts and the public.”
The Province has committed to $27 million over three years to build a comprehensive, science-based approach to protect and preserve B.C.'s 54 caribou herds. The number of woodland caribou in B.C. has declined, from 40,000 to less than 19,000, since the early 1900s. The program aims to restore this Canadian species to a sustainable population.
Considered threatened under the federal Species At Risk Act, the federal government has increased its efforts to protect the woodland caribou. The Province has also implemented detailed recovery plans that include caribou habitat recovery and restoration, predator management and increased maternal protection.
The public is invited to provide feedback before the June 15, 2018, deadline at: engage.gov.bc.ca/caribou
In addition to recently held stakeholder sessions, the ministry is reaching out to Indigenous communities for their input. All feedback gathered will help to inform the provincial caribou recovery program, which will be shared with the public in the spring of 2019.
A few months ago, Ontario NDP health critic France Gélinas realized just how overcrowded Ontario's hospitals are. That's when she saw someone sitting on a commode at Sudbury's Health Sciences North as she was walking by in the hallway.
That patient is not alone in enduring such indignity. Overcrowding is so bad at Ontario hospitals that patients are being cared for in hallways, visitors' lounges, sunrooms and storage rooms. The bed shortage, in fact, is reminiscent of the late 1990s when hospitals were actually turning patients away.
It shouldn't come as a surprise to the Wynne government. As the Star's Theresa Boyle reports, although Ontario's population has increased by 36 per cent since 1990 and the percentage of seniors who need more care is growing, the province has purposely shrunk its hospital system. In 1990 there were 33,403 acute-care hospital beds; today there are only 18,571.
The cuts have been so steep, in fact, that patient capacity at about half of Ontario's 145 hospital corporations during the annual winter surge exceeded 100 per cent and reached as high as 130 per cent, according to the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA).
That's dangerously high. Experts agree hospitals are most efficient at 85 per cent when they have room to manoeuvre for emergencies and surges. “There is no slack left in the system. Zero,” warns Hamilton Health Sciences president Rob MacIsaac.
Prisons would fall short of space: Maryam
Our Correspondent
Gujranwala
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz has claimed that prisons would fall short of space while rhetorically asking the top court how many of the people would be tried for contempt of court for supporting Nawaz Sharif despite disqualification as premier.
Addressing a convention of PML-N's social media workers in Gujranwala Friday and in his speech, she alleged that ‘the court operating on vengeance' has not been able to find witnesses against disqualified premier Nawaz Sharif in corruption references. She questioned disqualification of Nawaz Sharif by saying that entire cities continue to welcome him following the ouster.
She claimed that grounds where Nawaz Sharif addresses rallies fall short of space. She asserted that Nawaz Sharif had reached Gujranwala and pro-judiciary movement became a success.
‘Strategists' were hoping that Sharif family would fall apart, Maryam said and asserted that Nawaz Sharif has won after the disqualification.
She complained that top court has followed a path of holding people accountable for alleged contempt of court. How many of the people would be served contempt of court notices, she rhetorically asked.
Maryam Nawaz said that senator Nehal Hashmi's anti-judiciary speech disturbed her as Panama Papers case was under hearing at the time but would the top court that has sentenced Hashmi to a month-long imprisonment and five-year ban, hold former dictator Pervez Musharraf accountable for manhandling ex-chief justice of Pakistan (CJP).
Disqualified premier Nawaz Sharif met all the promises made to the people of Pakistan after assuming federal government in 2013. The government of PML-N eradicated power outages by overcoming energy crisis and countered terrorism.
The apex court declared a man godfather after he secured crores of votes and people's mandate, Maryam complained.
Fans who found it difficult to come to terms with the death of one of Our Girls the biggest characters, Elvis Harte, will be comforted to know that the show's leading actress also struggled. Ahead of Our Girl's return, Michelle Keegan, who plays Corporal Georgie Lane, has opened up about just what it was like filming without Luke Pasqualino, who acted opposite her as Elvis for three seasons. Spoiler alert — it wasn't easy.
As fans will know, the last season ended with a seriously unpleasant surprise. While viewers were busy hoping that the will-they-won't-they love interests Elvis and Georgie would finally overcome their differences and get back together, writers had another idea entirely. Much to everyone's shock and horror, they decidedly to kill off the army medic's on-off fiancé in devastating scenes, ending any hopes of a relationship revival.
But while it certainly made for heart-rending viewing, Our Girl has always been about much more than Georgie's love life. Remember when faced with the option of ex-boyfriend Elvis or current partner Jamie? She ditched them both and instead opted to head out alone, finding solace in her work as part of 2 Sections. So what can fans expect from the next series?
Well, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise to viewers that Georgie will be putting on a brave face in the aftermath of Elvis' death, and throwing herself into her work. Ahead of the show's return for Season 3, part 2, Keegan, who plays the fearless medic, shared some details about how her character is coping and just what it was like filming without Pasqualino on set for the first time.
BBC
After taking a break from her duties for six months, Georgie is back on the job, but that doesn't mean she's processed the loss. "She's had six months out for grievance purposes and is now throwing herself into work," Keegan explained in a BBC press release. "She's definitely not over Elvis at all and you'll see throughout the episodes that his death has really affected her."
You might think that like her character, Keegan would get some time off to come to terms with the finale of Our Girl: Nepal Tour. But, well, you'd be wrong. The actress was back filming scenes without him just a day after Pasqualino left.
BBC on YouTube
"It was really, really strange [filming without him]. Luke and I started on the series at the same time together and it was so odd when he left. It was like a hole and I definitely missed him," Keegan continued. "We literally started the next episode the day after Elvis died. Luke left on a Thursday and on a Friday we started to film episode 5. It took a long time for me to adjust as all our storylines were always based around Georgie and Elvis and the 'will they, won't they' situation. So when he wasn't there, I had to have a different mind-set."
But that's not to say that Pasqualino's absence will mean Elvis is totally forgotten. Keegan went on to reveal that Georgie will be keeping his memory alive in a seriously emosh way. Our Girl mega-fans, you may want to grab the tissues before you read this. It turns out that the medic is keeping the engagement ring he gave her with her at all times. Sniff. "She still wears his engagement ring around her neck, which was my idea, as she loved him so much and he was the love of her life. I thought it was a nice idea to have a part of him with her at all times," Keegan added.
BBC
The former Coronation Street actress also admitted that she'd been surprised by the fan reaction on social media after scenes of Elvis' death were shown. "Oh my god, I was in Malaysia at the time and it was 6:00am when it aired in the UK," she admitted. "I looked at my phone and it had gone crazy. What was great was that it hadn't been released that Elvis was going to get killed so it was obviously a massive shock for the audience who follow the story. I just remember that all the women's hearts on Twitter were broken that night."
While I'm not sure I'll ever quite recover from scenes of Elvis basically dying in Georgie's arms (that frantic CPR was just too much), it sounds like the upcoming instalments will have plenty of action to keep us occupied. There'll be a new recruit in the form of Bones (played by Olly Rix), who'll be stepping into Elvis' shoes as head of special forces. Unfortunately his and Georgie's relationship doesn't get off to the most promising start. "You first meet [Bones] when he is undercover. They get off to a rocky start as Georgie sees him in Nigeria where he throws a child out of his way," added Keegan. "But obviously goodie two shoes Georgie won't stand for that and ends up confronting him."
Ooh, I can't wait to see how that particular set-to pans out. I'm backing Georgie all the way.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian stocks are expected to erase recent losses and rise a little this year, but an array of political developments at home and overseas along with just a steady economic growth outlook will likely restrain the market, a Reuters poll showed.

While the Indian stock index gained nearly 7 percent in January and hit a lifetime high, it is down about 4 percent since then, tracking the rout in global equities as worries of a trade war between the U.S. and China intensified.
The consensus from the latest Reuters poll of over 50 strategists and brokers taken May 21-30 points to gains for the BSE Sensex.
The index, which is up 2.6 percent for the year, is now expected to gain 1.7 percent from Tuesday's close to 35,550 by end-2018. It is then forecast to hit a fresh record high of 36,300 by the middle of next year.
But over a third of respondents forecast the index to be lower then, including one strategist who expects it to dip to 27,500, a level not seen since January last year.
The consensus view is also the weakest six-month outlook since at least the financial crisis and is also a slight downgrade compared to three months ago.
A majority of poll respondents attributed their views to national election results or political developments outside the country.
More than half the losses so far this year have come after an inconclusive Karnataka state election earlier this month.
That has also coincided with the turmoil in global financial markets amid the political chaos in Italy.
“Ahead of the next year's general election and ongoing global political uncertainties, the stock market will not show any large up or down move, remaining consolidated,” said Vedant Manore, a consultant and trader at ‎Edelweiss Financial Services.
“But, if the (current) government wins the majority of seats in Parliament, stock prices would rally on hopes of quick policy decisions.”
Indeed, the more tempered view for a market used to double-digit gains in recent years was driven by the political situation in Karnataka which has clouded the outlook for general elections next year.
The surge in crude oil prices, India's biggest import item, has also weighed on stocks as it is inflationary and may push the Reserve Bank of India to raise rates much earlier than previously thought - possibly as soon as August. [RBI/INT]
India's economy probably gained a little momentum in the first three months of 2018 which should ensure that it remains the world's fastest growing major economy, a separate Reuters poll showed.
Still, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold $1.4 billion of Indian stocks this month, in line with a wide sell-off in emerging markets, driven by the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
After hitting a 10-year high of 25.69 in January, the BSE Sensex price-to-earnings ratio fell to 23.44 in May - above the long-term average of 18.74, suggesting stock prices are still expensive.

Last season was, to put it mildly, an absolute disaster for the Colorado Avalanche. They posted a 22-56-4 record, not only worst in the league but the worst in the salary cap era (dating back to the 2005-06 season). Their top scorer (Nathan MacKinnon) managed only 53 points, and virtually every lineup regular posted a minus rating, led (?) by Matt Duchene and Tyson Barrie (both -34). In goal, Semyon Varlamov suffered through the worst season of his career, managing only an .898 save percentage in 24 games. So given all that, should there be any reason for optimism in 2017-18? In a word, yes.
As witnessed in their opening night 4-2 win over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, the Avs are a far better team than last season would suggest. MacKinnon, Duchene, Barrie and sophomore forward Mikko Rantanen have the talent to turn the Avs' power play into a dominant force, and their performance against the Blueshirts' stout defense on Thursday night was an important step in the right direction. Former first overall pick (by the St. Louis Blues) Erik Johnson got the lion's share of the ice time alongside Barrie on the top defense pair, posting a +2 rating along with four hits. Most importantly of all, Varlamov rebounded in a huge way against the Rangers, stopping 37 of 39 shots (.949 save percentage) to lead the Avs to an upset win.
Without a doubt, Varlamov's strong play against the Rangers was critical for the Avs' confidence, demonstrating that he's finally healthy and perhaps ready to resume his position amongst the league's top netminders. If he falters, Jonathan Bernier (former Kings prospect and failed Leafs starter) could provide the Avs with a capable safety net, though his ugly performance for the Ducks in last year's playoffs (.873 save percentage, 3.28 goals-against) definitely gives cause for serious pause.
Of course, the pink elephant in the room is Duchene. Long rumored to be on the trading block, it was quite surprising that he suited up for the Avs on opening night. But given how well the team performed, perhaps winning will be the salve that keeps Duchene happy in an Avs uniform. With Duchene (26), MacKinnon (22) and rookie Tyson Jost (19) up the middle, the Avalanche could be very well-positioned for the long haul. And if Rantanen and mid-season trade acquisition Sven Andrighetto can progress in their first full seasons in Colorado, the team's offensive talent will certainly be in the top half of the league. Given how well the team played on Thursday night, it will be hard for GM Joe Sakic to justify dealing him away for futures; if a deal goes down, Sakic would almost certainly need to acquire a blueliner to provide support for Barrie and Johnson. The Avs' biggest weakness is on the blue line, but a strong start from rookie Andrei Mironov would help immensely, as would continue solid play from Chris Bigras (one assist, +1 rating).
No, the Avs probably won't be Cup contenders in 2017-18. But it's certainly reasonable to expect them to compete for a playoff spot, particularly if they can continue to progress from what was a pretty fantastic (and for many pundits, unexpected) start.

Moreover, NESTEA's new range of real-brewed teas is made with up to five ingredients (water, sugar, tea, rooibos and citric acid). New NESTEA sources its tea leaves from Nilgiri, India, a region known for producing high-quality tea. To showcase the product, the new NESTEA will have a contemporized, transparent bottle with a wider mouth and easier grippability.
The new fruit-flavored NESTEA product line comes in 6-packs and 23-ounce single bottles in these flavors:
Lemon
Peach
Raspberry

Rodney Smith Jr. is a mowing machine.
The native of the British island territory of Bermuda has cut lawns of various sizes in every state in the country. One of the biggest was in Vermont, where the founder of the nonprofit Raising Men Lawn Care Service said he used a push mower to single-handedly cut an acre's worth of grass in about two hours.
Rodney asked God to tell him his purpose. He found it when he saw an elderly man struggling to mow his lawn.
Militarykind
That's been just one stop in the second rendition (he completed the inaugural campaign last summer) of the 50 States 50 Lawns campaign, Smith's journey to cut lawns in every state for veterans.
The organization was born in 2016 during Smith's undergrad career at Alabama A&M. On his way home from school one day, he saw an elderly man mowing a yard. The man appeared to be struggling, so Smith decided to lend a hand. The rest is history.
See how Rodney is changing lives and lawns for military veterans with one small token of kindness.

PanARMENIAN.Net – Russian president Vladimir Putin made a surprise visit to Syria Monday, December 11, after a busy weekend that dealt with several regional issues, including the ongoing problems between the Israelis and Palestinians, Al-Masdar News reports.
Putin reportedly landed at the Hmaymim Military Airport near Jableh city this morning, making a rare appearance in Syria after more than six years of war.

Google is increasing its focus on India after it released a new social app that's aimed at building neighborhood communities within cities in the country.
The company's ‘Next Billion' team in charge of emerging markets has dedicated significant resources to India. Its initiatives include data-friendly versions of YouTube and other popular services, its Tez mobile payment app, a food delivery service and a national WiFi network initiative. Now it is adding one more to the list with the release of Neighbourly, a Q&A app for sharing local knowledge.
The basic goal is to give local communities an outlet to seek answers to practical questions about local life, routine and more. Google believes that an increase in urban migration, short-term leasing and busy lives has changed the dynamic of local communities and made it harder to share information quite so easily.
“Life happens close to home, in order the of a 1-2km radius, and local questions come up all the time. But as cities get bigger and bigger, we're finding that these local questions are getting hard to use — word of mouth used to be key,” Josh Woodward, a product manager within the Next Billion initiative, explained to TechCrunch.
“We built neighborly as a way to connect you with your neighborhood, ask questions, share expertise and stay up to date in a safe way,” he added.
This idea is nothing new, of course. Already in India, WhatsApp — which counts 200 million users in the country — has a range of community groups, but the big issue is discovery since new users have to be added to the group directly.
The new Google app is much like Jelly, the question and answer service from Twitter co-founder Biz Stone that was ultimately bought by Pinterest, but with localized tweaks. A beta version of the app is initially available in Mumbai, but users located in other areas can join a waitlist pending expansion.
Questions and answers are handled via swipeable cards — who knew Tinder's design would reach neighborhood community apps in India — while the app uses GPS to add a user into their neighborhood right from sign-up.
Woodward said Google is employing ranking and personalization technology which, over time, will match users with the kind of questions they can answer or have shown an interest in. For now, the service is app-based with a read-only mobile web version.
Google's local tweaks to make the app easy to use include voice-based entry for questions, which covers a range of India's non-English languages, and a series of prompts that pop up when a user decides to post a question to help them start.
The company has looked at safety issues, and made it easy to flag content which is unsuitable. Once flagged, Woodward confirmed the content is passed to a local content moderator who asses whether it is “neighborly.”
In terms of safety, users sign up using a first name only, there is no private messaging or phone number requirement, and individual profile photos cannot be copied via screenshot and don't expand when clicked to prevent being stolen. That taps into concern women have about their photos being abused, an issue that Facebook has taken measures against in India, too.
In fact, at sign-up, Google asks users to agree to a ‘contract' — “I will respect my neighbors” — before letting them into the app. But still, you'd imagine that the laws of the internet will mean that some people will misuse the service.
Profile pages do, however, display badges earned by answering questions — both an incentive and a display of trust, according to Woodward — while users can follow, and be followed, to keep with certain users and their content.
Google tested the app on thousands of users over a period of about a month to get the mechanics right. Woodward said that 30-50 percent of questions were answered within five minutes, which bodes well but discovery looks like being the key issue. That was ultimately the downfall of Jelly, albeit that both apps serve very different audiences and purposes.
Further down the line, Woodward said that Google could add business accounts and integrate other Google services into Neighbourly, but for now the sink-or-swim challenge is to make an impact.
The launch of Neighbourly comes the same day that Google launched Files Go in China. In doing so, the search giant gave a glimpse at its new strategy for China, which involves opportunistic product launches, relationships and strategic investments.
B.C. voters will be given three new voting systems to choose from in the mail-in referendum on proportional representation this fall.
Attorney General David Eby has decided the ballot will contain two questions, the first being a choice between the current “first past the post” system for choosing MLAs, and a proportional representation system.
The second question is a choice of three systems, determined after review of more than 90,000 submissions. They are:
• Dual member proportional, where neighbouring pairs of districts in B.C. would be combined into one two-member constituencies, except for the larger rural districts, which would remain unchanged.
• Mixed member proportional, which combines single-member districts with party list candidates, added to give each party the number of seats determined by their share of the province-wide vote in an election.
• Rural-urban proportional representation, with multi-member districts for urban and semi-urban areas, with voters choosing their MLA on a ranked ballot. In rural areas, a mixed-member proportional system using candidate lists chosen by parties would be used.
The complexity of the options means voters will not have an official map of the new voting districts when they make their choice. Eby said if voters choose to change to a new system, the district boundaries would be determined by the independent Electoral Boundaries Commission.
B.C. Liberal leader Andrew Wilkinson called the options an “alphabet soup” of systems, some never heard of before. He said Premier John Horgan broke two promises, including one in last year's election campaign to offer people a simple yes-or-no choice.
The other was that regional representation would be protected in the referendum, which will now be decided in a simple majority of province-wide results where rural regions of the province are vastly outnumbered by urban centres.
“You'll notice that they've launched this question the day before the legislature is scheduled to rise for the summer,” Wilkinson said. “That is a sleazy and manipulative step that they've taken to avoid public debate on this issue.”
Eby said his recommendation to cabinet is that parties that receive less than five per cent of the total popular vote would not get an MLA.
He said organizations in favour of proportional representation and in favour of the current system are “ready to go” and he hopes to have the formal campaign underway as soon as Elections BC can administer it.
Advocacy organizations will have a spending limit of $200,000 each and political parties will be subject to the same restrictions as an election, with no corporate or union donations permitted.
Details of the options are in the government's release here.

NASHVILLE — Indie Pereira and her wife Pari Bhatt still want a church wedding.
The Nashville couple regularly attends St. Philip's Episcopal Church, but opted for a civil ceremony in the living room of the city's former mayor because their bishop will not permit same-sex couples to have the religious ceremonies in the church.
Pereira and Bhatt live and worship within the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee, which is one of only eight dioceses in the country where such a ban exists. Their struggle is illustrative of how views on marriage continue to threaten the unity of the denomination.
The other dioceses that ban same-sex marriage ceremonies in the church are Albany, New York; Central Florida; Dallas; Florida; North Dakota; Springfield, Illinois; and the Virgin Islands, according to a report from the church's Task Force on the Study of Marriage.

"It amazes me that I could literally go to any other dioceses that touches us and get married," said Pereira.
But that could change soon.
Same-sex marriage rules could change
Episcopalians will consider altering rules related to weddings for same-sex couples when they gather this month in Texas for the denomination's triennial meeting. The legislative session of their General Convention begins Thursday and runs through July 13 at the Austin Convention Center.
Two resolutions before this year's General Convention could make weddings like the one Pereira and Bhatt want a reality.
One resolution, authored by the denomination's Task Force on the Study of Marriage, would require that bishops make the religious marriage ceremonies available to all couples. And, it proposes changes to the Episcopal Church's Book of Common Prayer, including stripping out the gender specific language as it relates to marriage.

May 19: Royal wedding 2018: Black bishop makes history, mentions slavery in American-style sermon
Three bishops put forward the second resolution. This one would give couples access to the religious wedding, too. But it would require bishops who object to have another willing bishop step in and authorize it. This resolution would not try to change the prayer book.
"My hope is that what they are able to do at the General Convention is to open this up to those of us who have been left out without making anyone feel like they have to participate in something that they're not ready for," Pereira said recently as she sat next to her wife in their home.
The current patchwork of rules started in 2015 when the General Convention opened the door for same-sex weddings by approving trial-use liturgies for marriage. But they left it up to each bishop to decide whether they could be used within their geographic regions.
Tennessee bishop stands firmly behind his decision
Ninety-three bishops authorized same-sex weddings, according to the report by the Task Force on the Study of Marriage. All but 20 of those bishops did so without conditions.
Bishop John Bauerschmidt, who oversees the Middle Tennessee region of the church, stands firmly by his decision not to authorize their use, nor allow clergy within his diocese to officiate the religious ceremonies or permit the weddings on church property.
In doing so, the bishop says he is being faithful to his job of guarding the discipline, faith and unity of the church.

July 2015: Episcopalians vote to allow gay marriage in churches
"The teaching that Christian marriage is between a man and a woman is reasonable, traditional, and scriptural," Bauerschmidt said in an email. "There really is nothing remarkable about a Christian bishop who holds to this teaching."
While Bishops can place limitations on the use of the marriage liturgies, they must refer couples to a willing diocese if they do not authorize them. Bauerschmidt chose the Diocese of Kentucky.
Pereira and Bhatt became engaged June 26, 2015, the day the U.S. Supreme Court declared that same-sex couples could legally marry across the country. The landmark decision came just days before the General Convention approved the trial-use liturgies for marriage, and Bauerschmidt issued his decision that November.
The couple did not want to marry in Kentucky.
Bhatt is originally from India, and the need for the legal protections civil marriage offers forced the issue. Megan Barry, who was Nashville mayor at the time, married the couple on Jan. 3, 2016, in her living room.
"It clouded the day because it felt like we had to do it at a place that we didn't want to do it," Pereira said. "We needed those protections while we were waiting for the church to come around."
While some members of the Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee disagree with Bauerschmidt's prohibition, some church members support it.
Langley Granbery, who is a member of an Episcopal Church in Nashville, agrees with Bauerschmidt because he believes the bishop's viewpoint matches what scripture says as well as the church's historic position on marriage.
"I'm very thankful that he's taken the stance on upholding traditional marriage," said Granbery.
He worries the denomination could eventually shift far astray of its past position on marriage. This year, he hopes the General Convention will not overrule bishops such as Bauerschmidt nor change what the book of prayer says about marriage.
Granbery is concerned that eventually there may no longer be space in the Episcopal Church for conservative positions like his.
The future is unknown
Bauerschmidt has tried to emphasize unity in the face of the division within the diocese, but the ban has strained relationships for those on both sides of the issue.
In January, church members voted nearly unanimously during their diocesan meeting to send an official message to the General Convention, asking the bishops and deputies to "take in account the exclusion, competing convictions, and loss of community experienced by members of this diocese" because of the 2015 policy change.
That step was driven in part by the work of All Sacraments for All People, a local grassroots group formed in response to the bishop's ban. The organization wants everyone to be able to belong to a congregation that allows them to receive all the sacraments, including marriage.
Connally Davies Penley, who is a part of the group, does not know what to expect from the General Convention, but is hopeful.
Davies Penley wants the resolution that does not require a bishop's permission passed.
They have been in touch with church members in some of the other seven dioceses where the use of the marriage liturgies is banned.
Members in the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas put together a similar campaign. The national group, Integrity USA, also continues to push for LGBTQ inclusion in the church and hopes the General Convention will make it so couples can marry in the church regardless of where they live in the U.S., said Bruce Garner, president of Integrity.
The Rev. Susan Russell, of California, who served on the Task Force on the Study of Marriage, said the bishops' resolution is well intentioned, but would enshrine a separate and inherently unequal status for LGBTQ church members.
"We can do better," Russell said in an email.
Resolutions can change as they make their way through the General Convention process. So it remains to be seen what will happen in Texas.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Earlier this year, the city of Hangzhou, home to the internet giant Alibaba, was poised to join Beijing, Shanghai and a handful of other urban areas in banning smoking in public places, part of a long-running campaign against tobacco use in China.

But, like the country's broader anti-smoking campaign, the Hangzhou initiative then lost momentum. Instead of blanket bans on smoking in public indoor spaces, the city revised its regulations to allow smoking in designated areas in train or bus stations, as well as in bars or karaoke clubs.
Opposition to the tougher rules, according to a top national tobacco control official, was led by China National Tobacco Corp, the state monopoly.
The company has reported rising sales over the last year, which anti-tobacco campaigners say has helped to stall earlier successes in the national anti-smoking campaign.
The official declined to be named, citing a lack of approval to speak to the media.
“When it comes to the tobacco industry's obstruction and interference in implementing specific tobacco control articles, China has a serious problem,” Yang Gonghuan, the former head of tobacco control at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said during a recent launch event for her book, “Tobacco Control in China.”
In the book, Yang details what she characterises as China Tobacco's efforts to thwart control measures by interfering with policy-making, spreading “false science” about the safety of low-tar cigarettes, promoting a smoking culture and criticizing anti-tobacco advocates for working with foreign organisations.
The company did not respond to faxes and phone calls seeking comment.
In official statements, China Tobacco says it is trying to improve public health by fulfilling tobacco control obligations and working to decrease things like tar in cigarettes.
China Tobacco is huge, powerful and opaque.
Selling 98 percent of the cigarettes in China under brands such as Red Pagoda Mountain and Double Happiness, the unlisted company is the world's biggest cigarette-maker by volume, generating revenue last year of 1.1 trillion yuan ($172 billion).
It accounts for roughly 7 to 11 percent of China's taxes.
EARLY PROGRESS
In 2015, after China rolled out measures under the World Health Organization's tobacco control convention, including a tax hike, health warnings on cigarette packets, advertising curbs, and public smoking bans, tobacco sales dropped for the first time since 2000. That trend continued into 2016.
In Beijing, tobacco sales dropped 8 percent in 2016 after smoking was banned in public places in July 2015, according to state media.
“When they saw the statistics, China Tobacco started to fight the policy at all costs,” the tobacco control official said.
In 2017, China Tobacco sold 0.8 percent more cigarettes than the year before; in the first three months of 2018, sales rose 4.15 percent by volume, according to official data.
CHEAP SMOKES
China produces and consumes the most tobacco of any country: over 300 million Chinese smoke, including more than half of all adult men, according to Yang.
Social acceptance of smoking in China, where cigarettes are often given as gifts at weddings or business gatherings, combined with low awareness of the associated health risks, means demand remains high despite 1 million tobacco-related deaths each year, according to her book.
Cigarettes are also cheap, even as other goods have become more expensive.
The affordability of average-priced brands, about 13 yuan per pack, and for cheaper brands, as little as 3 yuan, halved between 2001 and 2016, when taking into account inflation and rising income levels, according to research by Zheng Rong at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.
Illegal online sale of cigarettes via food delivery platforms, arcade games with cigarettes as prizes and thin cigarettes targeting female smokers have also fuelled sales in recent years, according to an article by Zheng Pinpin, a public health researcher at Fudan Univesity in Shanghai.
‘FIREWALL' HOPES
In March, China's parliament announced a reshuffle of the body in charge of implementing the WHO measures, putting the National Health Commission in the lead, which sparked hope among tobacco control advocates that the industry would be cut out of regulation.
“One would like to see, such as in Thailand, a process where a firewall is built between the concerns of the industry and its interests and any policymaking,” Gauden Galea, the WHO's China representative, told Reuters.
Yet, anti-smoking advocates worry that heavy reliance on tobacco tax revenue undermines political will to curb smoking.
An increase in the wholesale tax from 5 percent to 11 percent in 2015 is largely credited with the 2.3 and 5.6 percent drops in cigarette sales volumes in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
But Hu Teh-wei, an expert on China's tobacco industry at the University of California, Berkeley, said that impact had now been blunted and that significant tax hikes were needed to seriously deter smokers, a prospect he said was not currently under consideration in China.

Trailing last week's news of The Crown's reported equal pay disparity, a pool of organizers are calling Time's Up on the series' former leading man. As of Monday morning, March 19, a new public petition is asking The Crown actor Matt Smith to donate part of his The Crown salary to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. As reported by Variety last week, Smith made an undisclosed amount more on the Netflix series than Foy, who portrays Queen Elizabeth II, the titular crown of the series. Bustle reached out to Netflix for comment on the salary situation and the petition, but did not receive an immediate response.
The petition is asking that Smith donate the difference between his and Claire Foy's salaries to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund. "You know gender pay gaps are a problem when even the Queen isn't paid fairly," reads the petition, in bold-faced type. The petition is located on the Helmed by activist-centric social networking site Care2 (a virtual stomping ground for campaigns that focus on women's and civil rights, among other political and environmental issues) and it has already received over 23,000 signatures of its requested 25,000.

Foy and Smith have yet to publicly comment on the petition. Neither Left Bank nor Netflix have issued any public statements, either. (For the record, Left Bank, a Sony Pictures subsidiary, is the London-based production company who created The Crown.) During the INTV conference in Jerusalem last week, two of The Crown's head producers, Suzanne Mackie and Andy Harries (Left Bank's CEO and creative director, respectively), acknowledged the pay gap between the series' leading actors, crediting Smith's higher salary to his long-held Doctor Who fame. But, gearing up for the show's third season, the producers said they're committed to making a change. "Going forward, no one gets paid more than the Queen," said Mackie, according to a March 13 report by Variety.
Unfortunately, Foy will not reap the benefits of their redress, since The Crown's upcoming third and fourth seasons call for at least a partial overhaul of its cast members. Foy's performance as Queen Elizabeth II over the series' past two seasons has been met with widespread critical and commercial acclaim, the likes of which have earned her two Golden Globe nominations (the first of which, she won), as well as one Emmy nomination.
"Women in all industries are facing a struggle for pay equality," wrote the petition's lead organizer, listed on the site as Rebecca G. As most working women already know, the verity of Rebecca G.'s statement is certainly no well-kept secret. But, given the burgeoning momentum of Hollywood's Time's Up campaign, which seeks to end sexual assault, harassment, and inequality in the workplace, it seemed like the optimal time for a data-driven call-to-action.
The statistics, in and of themselves, are pretty much proof enough. Penning the petition's description, Rebecca G. continued,
"Women in the US typically earn 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts for full time work. And the pay gap for women of color is even more striking. Black women typically only make 63 cents for every dollar paid to their white male counterparts and Latina women only make 54 cents on average."
Her salary stats aligned with those presented by the U.S. Census Bureau. And, in addressing The Crown's wage disparity specifically, Rebecca G. explained the motives behind her advocacy. And while she did acknowledge that, compared to most women, Foy gets paid well, she also offered some insights into why the issue remains a critically important one. "While it may be easy for some to dismiss gender pay disparity for already high-paid actors like Claire Foy," wrote Rebecca G., "I believe that publicly addressing high-profile cases of sexism will also help create greater opportunities for all women — in all careers."
Stuart Hendry / Netflix
As Rebecca G.'s call-to-action stated, an earlier petition called on Mark Wahlberg to donate his re-shoot earnings from All The Money In The World to Time's Up after it was reported that he'd been compensated significantly more generously than Michelle Williams, his female co-star. In January, Wahlberg did end up donating his full $1.5 million re-shoot salary to Time's Up — and he did so in Williams' name. It remains to be seen if Smith will follow suit.

He has yet to sign a contract, yet to take his first steps as a professional and yet to experience the toll of the unique brand of intense fan and media scrutiny that is likely to meet his first extended slump, but already this much is clear about Hunter Greene: He may be the most intriguing, most important baseball prospect to arrive in years, if not ever.Greene, the 17-year-old Los Angeles prep superstar taken by the Cincinnati Reds with the second overall pick of this week's amateur draft, possesses the sort of electrifying ability one might expect of someone so young taken so high in the draft.But Greene's potential impact goes well beyond that. In many ways, he could be — as the headline of the Sports Illustrated cover story on him this spring put it, in all-caps — “THE STAR BASEBALL NEEDS,” and he is arguably the most marketable baseball prospect to come along since another former teenage SI cover boy, Bryce Harper, arrived in 2010, selected by the Washington Nationals with the first overall pick.Like Harper, Greene has the requisite combination of generational talent, preternatural charisma and indefinable star power to become an iconic player of his era. Both have compelling family backstories: Harper's father, Ron, was a Las Vegas steelworker who helped build some of the city's iconic casinos; Greene's father, Russell, is a renowned private investigator whose clients include Justin Bieber, Kanye West and the Kardashians.But there are elements of Greene's overall package that even Harper can't match.Article Continued BelowMost significantly, Greene is African American, and comes along at a time when the sport's effort to retain a foothold in the black community has reached a crossroads: Despite a massive expenditure in money and manpower on the part of Major League Baseball, fewer than eight per cent of big leaguers are African-American, down from a peak of around 20 per cent in the 1980s. (Royce Lewis, the Orange County prep shortstop taken with the first overall pick by the Minnesota Twins, also has an African-American father.)As a Little Leaguer, Greene attended MLB's Urban Youth Academy in Compton, California — one of the initiatives the sport has introduced in recent years in an attempt to grow the game in African-American communities. When he was 13, he won an essay-writing contest, the prize for which was an audience with Jackie Robinson's daughter, Sharon. He clearly understands and embraces the responsibility that comes with having his stature and platform.“This is huge for our game,” commissioner Rob Manfred, who announced each pick from the MLB Network studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, told reporters. “We hope these programs will continue to produce players like Hunter.”
Source: Masire: The president who left Botswana, the world an enduring legacy | Newsday (Opinion)
GABORONE — In the Western press, the legacies of African leaders tend to hinge on their respect for term limits, property rights and fiscal restraint.
Since his death in June 2017, the late Quett Ketumile Masire, Botswana's former Finance and Development Planning minister (1966-1980) and President (1980-1998), has been remembered largely in these terms.
A Washington Post obituary quoted former United States President Bill Clinton, who in 1998 called Masire “an inspiration to all who cherish freedom.”
Even before Masire's death, the literature on Botswana's economic history was filled with praise for his leadership.
A 1999 World Bank report hailed his government for its “fiscal discipline”.
A Harvard Business School case study described Botswana under Masire as a stalwart of “prudent social and macroeconomic policies.”
All of this is quite true. But there is more to the story. Masire was also original and daring.
While international financial institutions now praise his careful economic management, they often disagreed with his decisions and denied his requests.
One of the most important (but little-mentioned) parts of Masire's legacy was his commitment to invest in health and education programmes, even when the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised against it.
Fiscal prudence
Careful planning and hard work were central to Masire's identity. With both his parents dead by the time he was 21 years of age, it fell to Quett Masire, the eldest son, to look after his siblings.
He admitted to being a tough disciplinarian as manager of the family farm.
As Botswana's Finance minister and, later, as President, he made fiscal prudence a central tenet of policy making.
When diamond deposits were discovered shortly after Botswana's independence in 1966, Masire insisted the government saves a significant portion of its diamond revenues. He later wrote: “As farmers, we have always known the importance of saving for a rainy day, or in our case for a dry day.”
Development economists have applauded this practice, which allowed Botswana to escape the “resource curse” that has left many governments at the whim of volatile mineral prices.
But even the fiscally conservative Masire thought development institutions often took a too-narrow view of the determinants of growth.
In the late 1960s, before Botswana was able to draw on mineral revenues to finance public spending, the new government sought foreign aid.
When I interviewed Masire in November 2015, he recalled that while the World Bank would provide concessional loans for roads, bridges, power plants and factories, they would not finance health and education.
Investments in social services, bank officials told Masire, could not provide a sufficient “rate of return.”
By the mid-1970s, World Bank President Robert McNamara and bilateral aid agencies showed greater enthusiasm for health and education.
Breaking into a grin during our interview, Masire suggested that African leaders could claim some credit for this shift saying: “We would like to think we educated them. Because we said to them, look, without health, people cannot be productive. Without education,
people cannot improve their production . . . It's a long-term investment . . . So slowly, slowly, slowly, the penny dropped.”
Health and education
Botswana, though, did not wait for this about-face. By the 1970s the government was collecting diamond revenues and, less reliant on donors, it steadily expanded access to health and education.
In 1968, Botswana's government ran 12 hospitals, 16 health clinics, and no health posts.
By 1998, it operated 30 hospitals, 222 clinics, and 330 health posts.The number of public secondary schools increased from 9 in 1966 to 261 in 1996. The real test came in the early 1980s when demand for commodities (including diamonds) plunged and interest rates soared.
The IMF demanded its developing country borrowers adopt fiscal austerity.
Masire remained committed to fiscal prudence, but he disagreed with the IMF's one-size-fits-all approach.
He was, he later wrote, “determined” to use his government's hard-won savings so that “development efforts should proceed and not be seriously interrupted”.
During the global debt crisis of the early 1980s, when diamond sales fell, Masire demonstrated why he had saved so diligently.
Though Botswana was still poor enough to be eligible for an IMF loan, Masire declined the offer, and instead used the nation's own reserves to successfully weather the downturn.
Thanks to the government's continued spending on social services, health and education outcomes continued to improve. The literacy rate rose from 34% in 1981 to 86,5% in 2014.
While numerous studies have demonstrated an adverse impact on maternal and child health following IMF programmes, Botswana's independent course allowed it to achieve sub-Saharan Africa's second-lowest under-five mortality rate by 1990.
The Masire legacy
What led Masire to depart from the prescriptions of the World Bank and IMF?
In addition to framing health and education as integral to economic growth, Masire told me he was deeply affected by the poverty he witnessed during his childhood saying: “Some people suffered from malnutrition . . . and other people were sick, but could not go to hospitals because of their dire poverty . . . We felt that whatever we did, we must factor in social justice.”
Masire's tenure was not without failure. He came to openly regret his administration's delayed response to HIV and Aids.
By the mid-2000s, Botswana had one of the world's highest HIV prevalence rates.
Botswana remains a nation with tremendous income inequality, and the San people of the Kalahari Desert have long complained of mistreatment by the government.
Despite these profound challenges, Masire should be remembered for his courage as well as his prudence.
He was eager to hear advice from near and far, and he helped Botswana to blaze an independent path. Today, the nation he led is the better for it. Long before academic economists and epidemiologists detailed the adverse health outcomes of IMF austerity policies, Masire understood — and avoided — the deadly consequences of slashing social services. In doing so he left an inspiring example not only for Africa, but for the world.

Slippery Rock sophomore forward Micah Till makes a move for a layup in a game this past season. Till made several All-region and All-American teams at SRU, his fourth school in as many years.
Slippery Rock sophomore forward Micah Till makes a move for a layup in a game this past season. Till made several All-region and All-American teams at SRU, his fourth school in as many years.
This past basketball season, it became common news to hear that The Rock's sophomore forward was attaching yet another accolade to his name. The only Slippery Rock player to start all 30 games for a team that finished its season in the PSAC quarterfinals, Micah Till wrapped up his first season in the Green and White with a multitude of honors. Among other praises, Till was an All-PSAC West honoree and a consensus All-Region selection by both the National Association of Basketball Coaches and the Division II Conference Commissioner's Association. Most impressively, he was named as a third-team All-American by the D2CCA last month.
Now known as an integral part of Coach Kevin Reynolds' team, Till first opted to play on the turf instead of the hardwood. He made a pair of one-year stopovers in different states, with different sports, before ending up here in western Pennsylvania. Prior to his time as a significant player on two-state championship-winning teams at Wise High School in Upper Boro, Maryland, Till suffered a broken tibia and dislocated kneecap as a freshman.
“Going into eleventh grade, I wasn't on any map, anywhere,” Till said of the injury that set him back as a sophomore also. That all changed in the subsequent months.
He began receiving interest letters from D-1 schools while his football team cruised undefeated into the postseason. The Pumas march brought them to the title contest for the state's 4A classification at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. Trailing late in the fourth quarter, Till snared a fade pass from his quarterback to put his team ahead. The catch ended up being the game-winner.
Later that year, Till pledged to play football for North Carolina State over other ACC schools Duke, Maryland, and Pittsburgh, and SEC schools South Carolina and Missouri. He was the 42nd-ranked tight end (according to 247 Sports) in a 2014 position class that was headed by former Penn State tight end and NFL prospect Mike Gesicki.
“I felt like [N.C. State's] program would put me in the best position to further my football career,” Till said. “They had playing time open for me. I just felt like it was the best option.”
That summer, he was at an AAU tournament when Rutgers head basketball coach Eddie Jordan approached with the only high-level D-1 offer Till fielded as a high schooler.
“I told him, like, ‘I'm already going [to N.C. State] for football' and he told me, ‘Well, if you ever change your mind, you have a full ride to Rutgers',” Till said. “It was kind of an informal offer, but he still offered me.”
The following season, after his football team fell in defense of their title in the opening round of the state playoffs, Till looked for a better result in basketball. His team dropped two straight games in late-December and then responded by reeling off 16 straight wins to close out the regular season. Ending up in the state championship game, Till and company rolled Whitman High School, 70-43, for Wise's first-ever state title.
He moved to N.C. State the next fall and was told he would redshirt, and, saved for any sudden lack of depth at his position, would not see any game action in his freshman year. Meanwhile, in practice, he pulled in passes from junior quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who has since gone on to start for both the New England Patriots and Indianapolis Colts in the NFL. He frequently had to block Bradley Chubb, a top defensive prospect in this month's professional draft. Ultimately, with the demands of football and the absence of playing time with the Wolfpack, Till realized his love for the sport had waned.
“If you don't love the sport you're constantly doing, it's like having a job, but you don't want to work,” Till said. “All in all, I feel like I've always loved basketball more.”
He sat out the spring semester of 2016, unsure if it was just the school and setting that impacted the way he saw football. He visited a number of FCS schools, such as North Carolina A&T, North Carolina Central, and Bowie State, to see if they would be a fit on the gridiron. “It just never seemed right,” Till said.
He ended up at Harford Community College in Bel Air, Md., a little over an hour drive from his hometown. “I actually didn't have anywhere to go until the head coach remembered me from high school and was talking to people for me,” Till said. “That was pretty much my only full ride to junior college that I had on the table.”
In the summer before throwing on the blue jersey for Harford, Till played in three separate summer leagues. He played in the Kenner League, whose most notable alumni include NBA icon Allen Iverson and Steve Francis, the second-overall pick of the 1999 NBA Draft. He also played outdoors in the George Goodman League at Barry Farms, where Prince George's county-native and Golden State Warriors superstar Kevin Durant has rolled through.
The following winter, Till led his Fighting Owls to a 24-8 record and a Region 20 Championship. “Seeing [my family] at the games really kept me motivated … Just having them there supporting me throughout the time I was there was really helpful,” Till said. He paced his team's offensive effort with a 16.3 scoring average and grabbed the second-most rebounds by a Harford player.
Multiple PSAC schools showed interest in Till coming to play basketball for the school, and it turns out that The Rock was not initially his first choice. “I honestly wanted to go to Cal U at first,” Till admitted. His mind changed once SRU assistant coach Ian Grady began recruiting him. “[Coach Reynolds and Coach Grady] basically said that they were going to put the ball in my hands. That's always a valid option for me if I want to go somewhere and go to the next level,” he said. “Why not go somewhere where they're going to give you the ball and let you score?”
“The pitch to him was just ‘Hey, you're going to be part of one of the better teams in Division II,'” Head coach Kevin Reynolds stated. “'And, if you play up to your potential, you're going to have a good year, and so will our team'.”
Coming to Slippery Rock marked his fourth school in as many years, a frequency of change that would be tough to anyone, but was a little easier for the six-foot-seven forward. Born in Japan, Till lived overseas in Italy before moving to Spokane, Washington at age six and then again to Maryland at eight. Of the experiences, Micah stated, “Mentally, [moving a few times as a child helps]. You're used to moving and losing some relationships or just a lot of different things changing. I guess you could say it's helped me cope with everything.”
Growing up with two older brothers, his toughness carries over to his physicality as well. “My brothers both molded me to be tough and I think that shows in how I play,” Micah stated. Titus, four years older, was Maryland's third-ranked football player in Maryland in his recruiting class. He went on to play defensive back at the University of Maryland and transferred to James Madison University, where he played as a linebacker. “My [other brother] was real talented, there was just no one out there [in Washington] to see him play,” he said of his second older brother, Durward. “I always say that, if he had played in Maryland [like Titus and me], he would have ended up going Division I.”
Micah wasn't the only Harford player to transfer to SRU, as guard Aaron McDonald tagged along. “Having him [here too] definitely helped me feel a lot more comfortable about the situation […] “Knowing I'd have someone here who I knew and was comfortable playing with.” He lists SRU mainstays Cristal Malalu, Khyree Wooten, Merdic Green and Tony Gates as big help with the transition.
Again, conditioning was a minor issue in adapting to Coach Reynolds' offense. “When we first started doing live scrimmages […] I wasn't in very good shape. So Coach Reynolds was doing a lot of talking about how I might not be able to get a lot of playing time if I was out of shape,” Till said. “And I was just like ‘I'll show you on the court', that's what I kept saying. And when it came to that time it was real competitive, but I just felt like personally that I was standing out a little more.”
“I think he had a good year, but I also think he could have had a better year if his conditioning was at its best,” Reynolds said. “It's a credit to him that he's able to fight through it, but I think that's part of that football mentality, grind through it.”
Before leaving, Till spoke of what people see him as. “‘How was N.C. State?' is one of the first things people will ask me. Honestly, I wish people would look at it differently because I've always seen myself as a basketball player who played football up until I went to N.C. State,” he admitted. “It's kind of funny that now it's the other way around.”

University of Wisconsin's Blake Geoffrion, winner of the 2010 Hobey Baker Memorial Award for college hockey's best player, is the new Crown Prince of NCAA Hockey. Like a champion thoroughbred racehorse, Blake's hockey bloodlines can be traced back four generations. Howie Morenz, his great-grandfather, who played fourteen years in the NHL (twelve of those years with the Montreal Canadiens), is considered by some to be the best of all time. His grandfather, Bernie “Boom-Boom” Geoffrion, married Howie's daughter Marlene and after an outstanding career in Montreal, New York and Atlanta as player, coach and TV personality, followed his father-in-law into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Dan, his father, played four years in the NHL. Now, it is Blake's turn.
Let's take a look back in time at the evolution of this family dynasty.
The Origins of Howie Morenz
It all began at the turn of the 20th century with a talented young forward from Stratford, Ontario. Born in Mitchell, Ontario on June 21,1902, he started his career playing pond hockey on the Thames river. When the family moved to Stratford in 1917 Howie played five seasons with the Stratford Midgets of the OHL, leading them to the 1921 Memorial Cup finals against the Winnipeg Falcons. Despite his spectacular personal performance, they lost eleven-nine in a two-game total point series.
After the series, Falcon defenseman, Harry Roth said: “It was Morenz, Morenz, Morenz, as the fastest junior I ever saw, scored goal after goal. Howie had speed to burn. He would come right up to you and when you tried to check him he wasn't there.” He was soon dubbed: “The Stratford Streak”.
In 1920 he became an apprentice in the Canadian National Railway shop in his hometown. His hockey ability had a great deal to do with his appointment. Playing in a CNR Tournament game between teams from Point-St-Charles and Stratford at the Mount Royal Arena in December of 1922, Morenz scored nine goals. Ernest Sauve, after refereeing the game, drove immediately from the arena to the Windsor Hotel office of Leo Dandurand, managing partner of the Montreal Canadiens. There he informed his friend of this newfound marvel on skates.
Morenz the Canadien
Dandurand, who, along with his two friends, Joseph Cattarinich and Louis Letourneau, had acquired the team for eleven thousand dollars the year before, made a trip to Stratford in January to see him play and marveled at his innate abilities on the ice. His speed, his passion for the game, his checking prowess, all added up to a brilliant future wherever he decided to play. In a meeting at the Morenz home with Howie and his father William, Dandurand was informed that the boy would not be allowed to make any move away from Stratford that would interfere with his apprenticeship at the CN factory that had two years to go before completion. “It would be regrettable if he abandoned his trade,” mused William.
In July, after hearing that Morenz father and son had been considering playing for the Toronto St. Pat's, Dandurand summoned Cecil Hart, his trusted negotiator, to his office, armed him with signed checks for different denominations and put him on a train for Stratford. “Do not return without a signed contract,” he told Hart. By the end of the next day Hart visited Stratford, had worked his magic and was able to inform his Montreal patron that the deed was done. By coincidence the signing was concluded on July 7, 1923, Dandurand's 34th birthday, prompting Leo to decide that Morenz would wear Canadiens sweater number 7.
Howie Morenz's Career
In December 1923, Morenz joined the Canadiens, quickly impressing his new teammates and the local press with his speed and scoring touch. Three games into this first season, Elmer Ferguson of the Montreal Herald wrote: “He's the best looking youngster who has broken into the NHL. If he isn't a star of the first magnitude by season's end, it‘ll be because he has lost a leg.”
His new line mates were Aurel Joliat and Billy Boucher, the youngest forward line in the league, and they led the team to its first NHL regular-season title in five years. With the great Georges Vezina in goal and Sprague Cleghorn on defense, they went on to win his first and the Canadiens' second Stanley Cup, defeating first the Ottawa Senators for the Eastern title, and then both the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey League and the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League. In the first game of the Cup Finals, Morenz notched a hat trick as the team won, 6-1. In the second and final game, each member of his line scored, leading the team to a 3-0 victory. His legend was launched.
Morenz's Legacy
The Stratford Streak played eleven consecutive seasons for Les Habitants (1923 – 1934). In that time he became the brightest star ever to appear in the Canadiens' constellation. With their flashing speed and laser-like scoring abilities, he and his teammates filled not only the Mount Royal Arena but also every NHL arena they visited. Teamed with his friend and line mate, Aurel Joliat, he was never far from leading the league in goals scored and points earned. Though not a big man by NHL standards, (he stood 5'9” and weighed 165 lbs.) he played with a ferocity and passion that made him seem much bigger to his opponents.
In the 1927-1928 campaign, Morenz set a new league record, breaking the fifty-point barrier for the first time in the league's history with 33 goals and a 51-point total. His 18 assists also tied the league record set the year before by Chicago Blackhawk Dick Irvin.
In 1929-1930, he scored 40 goals in 44 games, and led his team to another Stanley Cup, adding three playoff goals to his totals, one of which was the Cup winning goal against the Boston Bruins. The following season he won the Hart Trophy for the second time, his second Art Ross Trophy for the scoring title and his third Stanley Cup.
Trouble Brewing in Montreal
In 1931-32 dark financial clouds were gathering over the Montreal Canadiens and their hard-working blue-collar fans. Every team in the league was affected by the stringent conditions brought on by the Great Depression. Thousands of seats in their home rink were empty, game after game. Despite winning his third Hart Trophy that year, Howie worried about his and his team's future.
Cecil Hart resigned the coaching position. Soon after, Dandurand and Cattarinich decided to sell the team to The Canadian Arena Company, owners of the Montreal Forum, for one hundred sixty-five thousand dollars. To make matters worse, in the fall of '33 the years started to catch up to the great Stratford superstar. Canadiens were no longer dominating their opponents. As he struggled with his scoring touch, the fans turned against him, disappointed that their hero could no longer leave defenders bewildered at the blue line. His vaunted speed was now a step slower. On October 1st, 1934, the rumors that had been bandied about in the Montreal press, rumors that the team was preparing to trade him, suddenly came to fruition. Headlines blared that the great Howie Morenz was traded to Chicago.
Morenz's Unhappy Trade
Without his beloved Bleu, Blanc et Rouge jersey Morenz was devastated. His turn in Chicago ended mercifully with a trade eighteen months later to the New York Rangers. His results there were not much better. At the end of that miserable season, Howie was forced to ask himself if indeed this was the end. Was it indeed time to hang them up? Then, to his delight, a miracle occurred.
The Canadiens had not fared much better than Morenz after their separation. The team was experiencing fiscal deficits, losing seasons, empty stands and disillusioned new owners. Looking to right the ship, the new management reached back in the club's history to rehire Cecil Hart, the winningest coach in their history. Hart's one condition for returning behind the bench was that the club re-acquire the Stratford Streak. Days later the deed was done and a jubilant Morenz could not believe his good fortune. He would return where he always knew he had belonged.
The End of a Storied Career
The season started out with the Canadiens battling the Montreal Maroons for first place. The rivalry was renewed, the spirit was back in the team, and the fans were returning. Morenz was high on his and the club's future. Reunited with Aurel Joliat and his old teammates the magic had returned.
On January 28 the Canadiens played the Black Hawks at home. Early in the game Morenz darted into the Chicago end with burly defenseman Earl Seibert in close pursuit. Suddenly, he lost an edge and fell feet-first towards the end boards. The blade of his left skate sliced through a crack in the planks. Seibert, caught by surprise at the fall, was unable to stop and piled into the fallen winger. The momentum of the collision carried both players further toward the goal but the snared leg did not move. Spectators could hear the bone snap.
Writhing in pain, he was carried from the ice by his teammates and later taken to L'Hopital St-Luc, where the club doctor determined that his leg was broken in four places.
Morenz's Injury
Hockey fans across North America prayed for his recovery. Bags full of get-well mail arrived at the hospital and at the Forum. After the initial expectation that the leg would heal quickly, reality and the seriousness of his injury slowly seeped into the atmosphere surrounding him. The fallen star became obsessed with the realization that he would never play again. His passion, “the fire in his belly”, that had driven him to the elite level of modern hockey was now turning inward on him, gnawing away at his psyche. He did not sleep and he would not eat. By the first week of March his doctor determined that he had suffered a nervous breakdown and ordered all visitation stopped so he could recover.
On March 8, suffering from chest pains late in the day, he was diagnosed with a heart attack. That night, around eleven-thirty, he struggled out of bed headed for the washroom. He never made it. Falling hard to the floor of his room, his heart gave way and he quickly passed away.
Saying Goodbye to Howie Morenz
The funeral was held on March 10 at the Montreal Forum. The doors opened at 11 a.m. and thousands of fans had formed a three-wide line all the way around the building, waiting to file past the casket and pay their last respects to their idol. His commitment to excellence in every aspect of the game, his loyalty to his team, and his love of the fans had won him a permanent place in their hearts. No one would ever replace him.
The service began at 2:30. Every seat in the building was filled. Thousands, after being turned away, milled about in the surrounding streets. His wife Mary and the children Howie Jr., Donald and the baby, Marlene sat in the first row of chairs placed on the boarded-over ice surface. Eight of his teammates acted as pallbearers and, at the conclusion of the eulogy, followed his cortege to the Cote-des-Neiges Cemetery where he was laid to rest.
Aurel Joliat spoke for the entire masses when he told the press: “Hockey was Howie's life. When he realized he would never play again, he couldn't live with it. I think Howie died of a broken heart.”
MEDINA, Ohio (AP)  A northeast Ohio man has pleaded guilty to fatally shooting his brother and sister last year.
The Medina (meh-DY'-nuh) Gazette (http://bit.ly/2lGI2po ) reports 43-year-old Dean Simms pleaded guilty Monday in Medina County to two counts of aggravated murder.
He was charged with killing 52-year old Cynthia Gesaman and 45-year-old Randy Szychowicz with a shotgun in February 2016 at the siblings' home in Hinckley Township, about 25 miles south of Cleveland. They were shot in the head.
The Medina County prosecutor says Simms never explained why he killed them.

A defense attorney says Simms could have faced the death penalty had he gone to trial and that plea negotiations were fair.
His sentencing is scheduled for April 3. He could face life in prison.

* Maruzen Petchem likely shipped products in question to 121 firms
* Maruzen President says no impact to product quality, safety
* Revelation latest in scandals to rock Japan's manufacturing (Recasts with formal announcement)
TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japan's Cosmo Energy Holdings said on Friday its subsidiary, Maruzen Petrochemical Co, failed to properly inspect 30 percent of its products for petrochemicals and tyres, the latest quality assurance scandal involving a Japanese company.
Maruzen Petrochemical said it was involved in “inappropriate conduct regarding quality inspection” on 21 products such as propylene and benzene produced at its two factories.
It said it failed to conduct some of the tests and analysis on products that are outlined in contracts with customers.
Maruzen Petrochemical President Masaru Nabeshima told reporters the misconduct had no impact on quality or safety and that it has continued to supply products to customers.
The revelation is the latest in a slew of scandals to rock Japan's manufacturing industry. Similar lapses have occurred at Kobe Steel and Toray Industries Inc, and incorrect final inspection procedures have been found at automakers Nissan and Subaru.
As of now, it does not appear that any laws have been broken, the company said. The products in question are likely to have been shipped to 121 corporate customers, it said.
President Nabeshima said the company would set up an internal investigative committee to make thorough checks on the issue and come up with measures to prevent their recurrence by around April.
Cosmo Energy Holdings has a 52.7 percent voting right in Maruzen Petrochemical. Other major shareholders include Ube Industries, Denka Co and JNC Corp.
A Cosmo Energy spokeswoman said some of the products in question had been manufactured by Maruzen's naphtha cracker at its Chiba plant, adding that it had rectified the misconduct by late January. The revelation would not lead to a halt in manufacturing units operated by Maruzen or Cosmo, she said.
Shares in Cosmo Energy fell as much as 10 percent before closing down 2.5 percent, against a 0.9 percent decline in the Nikkei average. (Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Richard Pullin and Tom Hogue)
In the lead actor Emmy races, which tend to recycle many of the same names year after year, it's rare to see more than two or three fresh faces in the mix. This year, a strong crowd of new hopefuls is hitting the playing field and that could test the history. (At least, one can only hope.)
Last year's first-timers in the drama category included a pair of actors from broadcast phenom “This Is Us” (Sterling K. Brown and Milo Ventimiglia) and an acting veteran from the wildly popular sci-fi program “Westworld” (Anthony Hopkins). The latter won't be in the mix this time, after Hopkins' character bowed out last season. Some other spots will open up as well, with the absence of Bob Odenkirk in “Better Call Saul” (premiering after the deadline) and the ejection of “House of Cards” star Kevin Spacey, who was removed from the Netflix series after his dramatic fall from grace amid sexual misconduct allegations last year.
Lined up and waiting to fill the void are nearly a dozen new contenders, though. Jason Bateman, for one, picked up Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations last year for his work in Netflix's “Ozark.” He's perhaps the strongest of the lot, with added visibility in comedy series “Arrested Development” to help his cause. “The Good Doctor” star Freddie Highmore, meanwhile, landed a Globe nom for the ABC series. He's poised for TV Academy recognition as well.
Related Milo Ventimiglia Wants 'This Is Us' to Explore His Character's Time in Vietnam 'The Terror' Team on Importance of Tuunbaq Attack Coming From 'Almost Surreal Vantage Point'
A number of actors in other debuting shows are worth keeping an eye on: James Franco, pulling double duty in HBO's “The Deuce,” though he could be sidelined due to his own brush with the #MeToo movement; J.K. Simmons, doing the same in Starz' “Counterpart”; Jonathan Groff, in David Fincher's Netflix psychodrama “Mindhunter”; and Donald Sutherland, as J. Paul Getty in FX's “Trust.”
Adding to the glut is HBO's plan to move “Westworld” players Ed Harris and Jeffrey Wright from supporting to lead this season.
In addition to reigning champ Brown and his “This Is Us” co-star Ventimiglia, incumbent nominees looking for another bid include Matthew Rhys in “The Americans” and Liev Schreiber in “Ray Donovan.” They'll join others like Rami Malek (a former winner for “Mr. Robot”) and Matt Smith (Netflix's “The Crown”) in a fierce competition.
On the comedy side, voters can be even more loathe to shake things up. One or two freshmen per year is the norm. Last year it was just a pair: Donald Glover (“Atlanta”) and Zach Galifianakis (“Baskets”).
This season, embattled comedian Aziz Ansari will be absent with “Master of None” on hiatus, while “Transparent” star Jeffrey Tambor won't be submitted for consideration by Amazon following sexual misbehavior allegations, allegations he has denied. (Tambor will, however, get a shot at recognition in the supporting race for “Arrested Development.”)
Eric McCormack picked up a Globe nom for NBC's returning “Will & Grace,” while Larry David was recognized by the Screen Actors Guild for HBO's own returning series, “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” And speaking of returns, Matt LeBlanc is eligible one last time for the final season of Showtime's “Episodes” (as well as his CBS sitcom “Man With a Plan”).
Debuting comedy contenders include Iain Armitage in “Young Sheldon” (CBS) and Tracy Morgan in “The Last O.G.” (TBS). They and the rest will be looking to join a race that already includes Galifianakis and last year's winner, Glover, along with other incumbents including Anthony Anderson (“Black-ish”) and William H. Macy (“Shameless”). Also lurking are Ted Danson (assuming NBC's “The Good Place” can find footing), Will Forte (a former two-time nominee for Fox's “The Last Man on Earth”) and Thomas Middleditch (also a former nominee, for HBO's “Silicon Valley”).
The good news for whichever newbies make the cut? Fully half of the last 10 lead actor winners (drama and comedy combined) have taken the gold on debut nominations. So hope springs eternal in the lead-up to the 70th annual Primetime Emmy Awards.
DUBAI, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Stock markets in the Gulf may be quiet on Sunday as investors are reluctant to invest aggressively but Dubai investment bank Shuaa Capital may shine after it reported strong quarterly results.
Tensions between the United States and North Korea have continued to escalate, driving investors to safe-haven buying of gold and the yen. On Friday, MSCI's index of stocks across the globe posted its largest weekly drop since the week before Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November, although Wall Street was stable. Brent oil settled at $52.10 a barrel, flat for the week.
However, Shuaa Capital said it swung to a second-quarter net profit of 12.1 million dirhams ($3.3 million) from a loss of 50.8 million dirhams a year ago.
The Dubai index, last at 3,647 points, has been slightly outperforming its peers over the last several weeks, and technical analysts at NBAD Securities say the main trend remains bullish as the index is trading above its 14- and 21-day moving averages.

Tech Is Dominating Efforts To Educate Syrian Refugees
Enlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
The crisis in Syria has displaced around 1.4 million children and teenagers from their homes. An estimated 900,000 of them are not in school.
Historically, in conflict zones, education has taken a backseat to immediate needs like food, shelter and medical care. But more recently, there has been a movement in the international aid community to provide better "education in emergencies."
Many private companies and nonprofits are stepping up to do just this — but their efforts are not always well balanced or well coordinated, a new report claims.
Would-be students have many immediate needs. They have universally experienced some form of trauma. There is a lack of schools, teachers, books, uniforms and food. Yet, according to this study, nearly half of the donors have chosen to supply educational technology, far more than are building schools, providing basic books and materials or employing teachers.
"Many of these companies are based in Silicon Valley, and they do not have a very clear picture of the context they are delivering to," says Zeena Zakharia at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the coauthor of the report.
Zakharia has been researching education in Middle East conflict zones for over a decade, and she noted the growing role taken by the private sector, both philanthropies and corporations. "I was like, isn't this interesting!" she tells NPR Ed. At the same time, her colleague Francine Menashy, whose research focuses on the privatization of education, had noticed the same phenomenon.
The two collaborated on research, interviewing more than two dozen people dealing with the education of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Education International, a global federation of teachers' unions, released the report.
Zakharia and Menashy catalogued a recent, and overwhelming surge of interest among donors in supporting education for refugee children.
This survey doesn't capture every form of aid available to Syrian refugees, who are assisted by international governments and nonprofits like the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders. The authors were trying to get a sense of what the private sector was up to. They counted 46 businesses, such as Accenture, Bridge International Academies, Goldman Sachs, Hewlett Packard, IBM, McKinsey & Co, Microsoft and Pearson Education, with money or projects in the area. In addition they counted 15 philanthropies, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, IKEA Foundation, Open Society Foundation, and Vitol Foundation. (The Gates Foundation and Open Society Foundation also fund NPR).
These private organizations often back more than one type of educational activity, but there are clear trends. The authors found that 1 percent of organizations focused resources on social and emotional skills; 5 percent on extracurriculars such as sports; while fully half were focused on providing education technology. To oversimplify a bit, for every donor funding a soccer ball there are 10 backing tablets, educational games, online courses or learning platforms.
She says one school leader in Lebanon told her she was approached "every week" with offers of technology.
"And I say, 'Oh great, come visit us, see how we operate. And they do not.' "
This is a problem, Zakharia says, because based on her interviews, ed-tech isn't necessarily what existing schools need or are asking for.
For example, in many settings with Syrian refugee children, there is electricity one hour a day at best, so keeping devices charged can be a problem. "If you don't have the resources to build latrines or to pay teachers, I mean ... investing in technology isn't well placed," another interviewee told the researchers.
In addition to the desire to help, many of the business donors Zakharia interviewed talked about the financial motivations behind their initiatives, such as improving their brand image, breaking into the lucrative, untapped Middle East market, and testing new innovations. The idea of dual motivation is nothing new for corporate philanthropy, of course. But, says Zakharia, there is always a risk when these business motives come into play.
"What happens when the initiative is not seen as profitable? Education is a very long-term commitment."

This is the fourth story in a five-part series on the issues surrounding Kinder Morgan's proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, investigating the history, science, Indigenous reaction, politics and economics of the controversial project. Read part one, part two, part three and part four.
There's a lot riding on the federal government's decision to take over the Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project from Edmonton to its terminal in Burnaby.
Kinder Morgan agreed to carry on with its construction plan as part of Ottawa's offer to buy its Canadian assets, primarily the pipeline and its terminal, for $4.5 billion.
The federal purchase does not include the $7.4 billion construction budget, which is to be financed by Ottawa and Alberta. Kinder Morgan estimates that the first 20 years of construction and operation would generate $46.7 billion, including federal and provincial taxes paid. Over the same period, the company calculates that municipal tax payments over 20 years would total $922 million in B.C. and another $124 million in Alberta.
The Conference Board of Canada estimates the project would create the equivalent of 15,000 person-years of employment in construction and 37,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs each year it operates.
Benefits agreements have been signed with 19 communities, representing $8.6 million in infrastructure, education and training projects. Examples include $500,000 for improvements to Hope Community Park, $290,000 for trails and trades training in Barriere, $845,000 for community infrastructure and training in the Thompson Nicola Regional District, $390,000 for projects and training in Clearwater, $1.3 million to revitalize an Abbotsford golf course and $1.2 million for a new Vedder Greenway trail pedestrian bridge in Chilliwack.
There are another 43 “mutual benefit agreements” with Indigenous communities, 33 in B.C. and the rest in Alberta. Kinder Morgan says those agreements will see $400 million go to the communities, and agreements may be extended as the project proceeds.
Trans Mountain requires its contractors to have Indigenous monitors on its environmental inspection teams at all construction areas, advising on traditional land use and cultural values.
Beyond the direct jobs and community benefits agreements along the route, the project is a key step toward increased spill response capability on the B.C. coast. It also affects the supply of crude oil to southern B.C.'s last oil refinery and bigger refineries in Washington.
And then there are pending oil pipelines to the U.S., and another proposal to build a pipeline similar to the cancelled Northern Gateway pipeline across northern B.C.
Here's a closer look at the implications.
What happens if there's a spill
Spill response on the B.C. coast is the responsibility of Western Canada Marine Response Corp. (WCMRC), an industry-funded network of facilities and vessels that works with the Coast Guard to respond contain and clean up incidents.
As part of its Trans Mountain expansion, Kinder Morgan Canada committed $150 million to increased response equipment and bases, conditional on completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project.
That funding was suspended in April, along with all non-essential spending on the pipeline, with Kinder Morgan seeking assurances by the end of May that further delays and demands won't be imposed on a project that has already received federal and provincial approval.
WCMRC plans include response bases at Burrard Inlet, on the Lower Fraser River, Nanaimo, Port Alberni, Sidney, Beecher Bay in the Juan de Fuca Strait, as well as an offshore supply vessel to be based at Ogden Point in Victoria. Kinder Morgan's conditions laid down by the National Energy Board require that those facilities be up and running nine months before the Trans Mountain expansion begins operation.
Ogden Point is Victoria's cruise ship terminal, and may also be the location of a new spill response vessel financed by Kinder Morgan Canada if the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion proceeds. (Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)
The project suspension puts all that work on hold, said Michael Lowry, communications manager for WCMRC.
“We were close to signing leases in a lot of these spots,” Lowry said.
“We had construction vendors all lined up, tender packages ready to go to start construction this summer.”
The goal of the response bases is to reduce the maximum response time for Vancouver Harbour from six hours to two. The six-hour maximum would then be applied to the entire southern B.C. shipping lane, where in remote places the response time can be up to 72 hours.
In November 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an upgrade to marine spill response for the West Coast. It included two new large vessels capable of towing large freighters or other ships in distress, such as the U.S. tugboat and fuel barge that had run aground near Bella Bella on the remote B.C. coast.
“Canada has the longest coastline in the world, and it's a poorly kept secret that we haven't done enough to protect it,” Trudeau said after touring Vancouver harbour aboard a Coast Guard vessel.
Cleanup crew works on Burrard Inlet shoreline after a backhoe ruptured the Trans Mountain pipeline in July 2007. About 224 cubic metres of heavy synthetic crude was spilled, affecting a residential area, a creek and the inlet shore after some of the oil ran down a storm drain outfall. Approximately 95 per cent of the released oil was recovered. (Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)(Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)
That national project was not a direct response to the potential for increased tanker traffic. The B.C. government calculates that while all eyes are on the potential seven-fold increase in oil tankers, the Trans Mountain expansion represents only a six per cent increase in total shipping.
There has never been a spill of crude oil tanker cargo in B.C., after 64 years of Trans Mountain delivering crude to the Westridge tanker terminal at Burnaby, and daily Alaska tanker traffic past B.C. for nearly 50 years. Recent spills included a fuel system rupture of the freighter MV Marathassa in Vancouver harbour in 2015, spilling bunker fuel, a semi-refined product carried in large quantities by many ocean-going vessels.
Oil price and investment
Alberta oil is “landlocked,” as a U.S. protest network's strategy first described it in 2008. Pipeline backers point to the discount on Western Canada Select, as Alberta heavy oil is called by traders, and West Texas Intermediate, the similar grade of U.S. crude.
Between 2012 and 2017, the price difference averaged $16.54 a barrel. As the Fraser Institute pointed out in a May report, The Cost of Pipeline Constraints in Canada, the 2018 price spread is $26.30 a barrel, which works out to an annual loss of $15.8 billion on Canadian oil.
Calculating the investment impact of cancelling third major pipeline project is less certain. The Justin Trudeau government effectively killed the Northern Gateway pipeline by banning crude tankers docking on B.C.'s North Coast, then added downstream greenhouse gas requirements to the Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic coast that caused Trans Canada Corp. to abandon the project.
Energy East would have converted existing gas pipelines, moving Alberta oil to refineries that currently depend on imported oil from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and other sources.
Oil refineries
With Imperial Oil's refinery at Port Moody long dismantled, the last remaining source of refined fuels in southern B.C. is near the Trans Mountain Burnaby terminal. The Burnaby refinery was acquired from Chevron in April 2017 by Parkland Fuel Corp,, a Red Deer-based company that also owns Columbia Fuels on Vancouver Island.
The $1.5 billion purchase includes more than 100 Chevron-branded filling stations in B.C., marine fuelling stations and an aviation fuels business supplying Vancouver International Airport.
Trans Mountain, one of few pipelines in North America used for shipping refined fuels and crude oil in batches, also supplies the Parkland refinery. News of the Trans Mountain expansion prompted Parkland CEO Bob Espey to express his concerns to the B.C. and Alberta governments.
“Our company's view is that any measure that restricts the supply of oil to British Columbia would be negative for both the economies and B.C. and Alberta,” Espey said in a statement. “We are committed to doing what we can to serve our customers and will continue to monitor the issue closely.”
The Cherry Point refinery in Washington State(BP)
Washington state's five refineries, at Cherry Point, Anacortes and Ferndale, receive crude from the Trans Mountain pipeline as well as by tankers from Alaska. With Trans Mountain now over-subscribed, Alberta oil is moving by rail in greater volumes, winding down the Fraser Canyon to enter the U.S. at Bellingham.
A 2017 Washington state ecology department report says the volume of Alberta oil shipped by train to the state has more than doubled, from 7,000 barrels a day in 2012 to 15,000. That translates to 80 to 90 rail cars per week carrying Alberta heavy crude through B.C.
Other pipelines
Alberta's oilsands crude is in demand in California and the U.S. Gulf Coast, where refineries are built to handle heavy oil such as Venezuela's oilsands product. Some critics say much of Trans Mountain's additional capacity would go south, rather than by Aframax-sized tankers across the Pacific to Asia.
Enbridge is working on its Line 3 replacement, from Hardisty, Alberta across Saskatchewan and into the U.S. Construction of the Saskatchewan and Manitoba sections is scheduled to start in the fall of 2018.
U.S. President Donald Trump carried out his campaign promise to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which faced similar international opposition as Trans Mountain does today. Keystone would run from Hardisty to Nebraska, strengthening Alberta's historic ties to the U.S. petroleum industry.
Another project that could benefit from Trans Mountain's expansion being cancelled is Eagle Spirit Energy, an Indigenous-led effort to build a pipeline across northern B.C. similar to Northern Gateway.
Eagle Spirit founder Calvin Helin has backing from the Aquilini Group, real estate developers and owners of the Vancouver Canucks. A lawyer from Lax Kw'alaams on the northwest coast, Helin has worked to secure Indigenous consent for a pipeline route that terminates at Grassy Point, in Lax Kw'alaams territory.
Where the Trans Mountain expansion is opposed by the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh, Eagle Spirit may have consent for the Grassy Point terminal, which could accommodate larger crude carriers for Asian ports.
Another coastal option is a refinery proposal backed by Black Press chairman David Black, that was originally to be supplied by the Northern Gateway pipeline to a site near Kitimat.
The Trudeau government's decision to ban crude oil tankers from the North Coast is being challenged in court by Eagle Spirit, but Black has since focused on an innovation that would see Alberta bitumen dried to a solid and shipped by rail hopper cars for processing.
In the event of a land spill, the product could be picked up without significant impact, Black said.

Is this the most quintessentially Yorkshire moment ever?
Two of the county's sporting heroes stepped in to rescue some lambs which had escaped from a field in the Dales.
Olympic triathletes Alistair and Jonny Brownlee were cycling one of their favourite routes last week on a pre-Easter training ride.
And the Leeds-based stars didn't hesitate to help out when they spotted the spring lambs in trouble.
Seeing the creatures had escaped onto the road, the brothers picked them up and returned them to safety.
Such a competent display of animal husbandry will no doubt have impressed their youngest brother Ed, who is currently studying to become a vet.
A former Beaverton nurse who pleaded guilty to charges including third-degree sex abuse was sentenced to more than two years in prison.

Jakarta
At least 23 people were killed and dozens rescued after a blaze ripped through a boat carrying tourists to Indonesian islands.
The craft was heading to islands north of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, when it caught fire with around 230 people on board.
Another 22 people needed hospital treatment after being injured, the Thousand Island police said.
One survivor told local media: “Fifteen minutes after the boat set sail, people at the back of the boat started making noise. Then I saw smoke. There was more and more, the boat was crowded and people were fighting for life jackets.”
Another passenger said: “When we wanted to go, I panicked because I saw my son jump off the boat without a (life jacket) because somebody else had taken it.” Nearby fishermen managed to get many of the survivors out of the water.
The head of Jakarta's search and rescue agency, Hendra Sudirman, said 98 people had been rescued.
A search involving 10 ships has been launched to try to find 17 people still missing. All those on board are believed to have been Indonesian.
The fire broke out aboard the Zahro Express about 15 minutes after it left Muara Angke port in north Jakarta early on Sunday.
The cause of the blaze has not been confirmed, although one police source said it may have been a short circuit on the boat's power generator. Sea accidents are frequent in Indonesia — a sprawling archipelago — with vessels often overloaded and having too few life jackets on boat. — Agencies
Donald Trump is the most powerful person in sports this year.
So says SportsBusiness Journal in its annual 50 Most Influential List, which was published on Monday naming Trump "for his angry, loud and visceral rhetoric that has divided the sports industry and caused massive reaction, response and reflection."
"There are many elements about this choice that are unfortunate," wrote the trade publication's executive editor Abe Madkour. "The biggest being it's not a positive for the industry we work in and cover. But when pressed to decide who had the greatest influence -- positive or negative -- on the sports business this year, it came down to an individual outside of sports who had the business on its back foot since he arrived on the political scene in 2015."
Trump's year in sports most prominently featured his battle, mostly via Twitter, with NFL players for their protests during the national anthem and the league for its failure, in his opinion, to address kneeling players by mandating standing during "The Star-Spangled Banner." He also withdrew the Golden State Warriors' invitation to come to the White House after Warriors guard Stephen Curry said he wouldn't go.
Recently, Trump's back and forth with LaVar Ball over being "ungrateful" for what Trump said was his help to get UCLA basketball players, including his son LiAngelo, out of China after shoplifting, got plenty of play.
"Nothing drove more attention to -- and response from -- the sports industry than Trump," Madkour wrote. The amount of media attention was overwhelming."
NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who finished first last year, was No. 2 on the list, followed by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and NBC Sports chairman Mark Lazarus.
The biggest year-over-year jumps on the list were Fanatics owner Michael Rubin, who moved up 10 spots from No. 29 last year to No. 19 this year. The biggest drop was Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank, who fell 18 spots from No. 16 to No. 34.
Two athletes made the most influential list: LeBron James (No. 23) and Colin Kaepernick (No. 50).
LANSING (AP)  Democrat Shri Thanedar is highlighting his background as a scientist in the first TV ad of the 2018 governors race.
The ad, which debuts Tuesday 11 months before the general election, criticizes President Donald Trump as a climate change denier and Gov. Rick Snyder as an accountant who brought us the Flint drinking water crisis.
Thanedar, a political newcomer who sold a stake in his chemical-testing company, has given his campaign nearly $6 million.
The ad touts Thanedar as a chemist who worked on medicines ignored by big drug companies. It notes his support for a single-payer health care system and calls him the most progressive Democrat running.

PRESS RELEASE – IN the last seven years of our existence as a political movement, no one has ever been able to accuse the Lucian People's Movement (LPM) of not being a responsible opposition that always fights for the best interest of our country.
While we fought bravely against the inadequacies and failures of the Saint Lucia Labour Party (SLP) when it governed St. Lucia, we also demonstrated balance in our praise of its efforts whenever it was warranted.
By June 6, 2016, on the very day that the SLP was finally booted out of office, it was the consensus within the LPM that a grace period of six months should be afforded to the new government of the United Workers Party (UWP). We felt then that the UWP deserved the very same consideration which was given to the SLP in 2011.
In honouring our commitment to respect the wishes of the people, the LPM did everything in its power to remain silent and to allow the UWP to make the transition from politics to governance. We had hope then that the UWP would see the merit in becoming the government of all the people and, thus, become transparent with our nation. It was also our hope that the UWP would have demonstrated that, unlike the previous administration, it was capable of governing with a remarkable difference.
Sadly, on its first anniversary in office, none of this has happened. Instead, what we have is a government that enjoys peddling untruths, seeks to alienate fellow St. Lucians who did not vote for it, and is not transparent about its activities and the work which it does on behalf of our nation.
We have been placed at a great disadvantage by this government's inability to create a level playing field, which would ensure that local entrepreneurs are given the very same respect and lavish opportunities that are granted to their foreign counterparts.
Today, what we have in St. Lucia is a government that continues to promote political tribalism, engages in gross victimisation, and enjoys promoting internal corruption (which puts some members of government on track to becoming very wealthy overnight), among a whole list of dirty laundry and political transgressions against the common interest of the people of St. Lucia.
To make matters worse, we have become very disillusioned with the direction in which our Prime Minister is taking the country. His arrogant political posturing and high-handed behaviour in undermining the opinions of those who disagree with his policies invoke a growing dislike for him within the ranks of the LPM.
While Mr. Chastanet has aligned himself with conservative political values, he has failed to realise that St. Lucia is not the United States, where there are safety nets to protect the poor and less fortunate among us. Moreover, even the great United States, which is today ruled by an irrational and perhaps insanely dangerous president in the person of Donald Trump, still cannot prevent millions of its poor and disadvantaged citizens from falling through the cracks.
Therefore, when the Prime Minister of St. Lucia purposefully sets out to introduce a Donald Trump- or Republican Party-like agenda which seeks to benefit the rich while crushing the ambitions of St. Lucia's already poor and desperate lower class, the LPM can no longer remain silent in the face of this vicious political onslaught.
Those who believe that the Prime Minister is alone in this need look no further than at the men and women around him and, specifically, at those who enable him through their silence to pursue these incoherent policies. They, in the view of the LPM, are no different from the Prime Minister.
Although it has been a full year since the election of the UWP into office, there are no tangible signs that things are about to get any better in the country anytime soon. Unemployment is still dangerously high, and crime is threatening to finally destroy the existence of peaceful communities throughout the island while only a few members of the UWP have profited from a change in government since 2016.
As members of the LPM, we affirm that the end results will be no different from what has traditionally obtained in the country. It is our view that, given the governing trajectory of the UWP, one can expect nothing more than ti-boutik-style road repair projects, upgraded public facilities, and the offering of rations and other political sponsorship in hopes of securing re-election in 2021.
Within the entire scope of this perpetual struggle for economic survival in St. Lucia for the last 38 years of self-rule, all we have seen are big promises of jobs, which, in the end, amount to nothing more than a grand illusion of comfort to partisans and political fools.
The Desert Star Holdings Limited (DSH) (project), with all of its economic trappings of grandiosity and infused with the short-sightedness of all Mr. Chastanet's men put together, will prove grossly inadequate in terms of fulfilling our nation's need to effectively eradicate poverty and provide decent-paying jobs for most St. Lucians.
It is for this very reason that today, the LPM is drawing a line in the sand by stepping up our commitment to oppose a Prime Minister who is too proud to listen, does not entertain dialogue, and is too naïve to even understand that these bad policies serve only to diminish his political appeal.
As a small political organisation, it is clear that we cannot do it alone, and so, we would like to enlist the support of new members who are willing to offer our country a new flicker of hope.
No one who understands and values progress can sit around without questioning the rule of a man who is too arrogant to accept that protecting the country's poor and those who are already economically oppressed is the very essence of good governance.

Britney Spears
Net worth: $200 million (as of February 2017)
Year of birth: 1981
1981 Education: Parklane Academy Professional Performing Arts School
How Britney Spears' net worth was built
Britney Spears made her debut in front of America back in 1992 on the competition show "Star Search." She didn't win the competition, but she did land a role on Disney's "The All-New Mickey Mouse Club" later that year, alongside Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.
After leaving the show, Britney focused on building her music career. In 1998, she released her first single "Baby One More Time," which launched her to superstar status by selling more than 500,000 copies in its first day. Since then, six out of seven of her albums have reached No.1 on the Billboard 200 charts.
In addition to singing, Britney has also starred in movies, made guest appearances in TV shows and designed her own clothing line. Britney even returned to a competition show as a judge for "The X-Factor." She's sold more than 100 million records in a career that has spanned more than two decades, earning her a net worth of an estimated $200 million.

What she's up to now
Britney Spears has taken up residency in Las Vegas where she performs her show "Britney: Piece of Me" at Planet Hollywood. She began her stint in 2013 and is expected to remain there until December 2017.
Her show is an energetic performance of all her chart-topping hits and some new songs from her latest album. She continues to make music and released her ninth studio album titled "Glory" in August 2016. Later that year, she confirmed that she's already working on her 10th studio album, proving that she's still hard at work despite her busy performance schedule.
Accolades
Britney Spears started racking up awards wins in 1999 when she was nominated for and won Billboard Awards in the categories of New Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, Female Albums Artist of the Year, and Female Singles Albums of the Year. Since then she's won countless awards, including American Music Awards, MTV Music Awards, Kids' Choice Awards and People's Choice Awards.
Perhaps her most impressive feats are the multiple world records she's set over the years, such as best-selling teenage artist and youngest female artist to have six number one albums.
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak, on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to abuse of power and other charges arising from an investigation into a scandal-plagued state fund, weeks after he was ousted in a stunning election defeat.
Najib, 64, who has denied wrongdoing in relation to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund he founded, was charged with abuse of power and three counts of criminal breach of trust as part of an investigation into a transaction involving its former unit SRC International.
The charges relate to some 42 million ringgits ($10.4 million) of funds that allegedly went from SRC into Najib's personal bank account. This represents a small fraction of the billions of dollars the U.S. Department of Justice has said was misappropriated from 1MDB.
Malaysia's attorney general said he expected more reports from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) investigating wrongdoing at the fund.
“This is arising from the first MACC IP (investigation papers) given to my office three weeks ago. No doubt there will be more,” Tommy Thomas, who is leading the case against Najib, told reporters outside the court.
In a pre-recorded message posted on Twitter after his arrest, Najib said he was not perfect and “not all the accusations against me and my family are true.
“Let investigations be carried out. I have not had a chance to defend myself,” he said.
Each of the four charges against Najib carries a prison term of up to 20 years. The abuse of power charge carries a fine of not less than five times the “value of gratification”.
Najib was granted bail of 1 million ringgits ($247,000) and was ordered to surrender his passports. The judge set a tentative date for the trial to begin of Feb. 18, 2019.
The son of a former prime minister, Najib joined parliament at the age of 23 and rose through the ranks to take the top job in 2009. But his second term in office from 2013 was plagued by allegations around 1MDB, prompting a stunning fall from grace that culminated in his arrest on Tuesday.

Mahathir Mohamad, who helped Najib's political ascent before turning on him as the allegations surfaced, led a campaign that unseated Najib in a May 9 election and ousted a coalition that had ruled since Malaysia's independence from Britain in 1957.
One of Mahathir's first acts was to reopen the 1MDB investigation.
SUPPORTERS GATHER
After spending the night in detention, Najib arrived at the court in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday wearing a dark blue suit and a red tie.
Crowds of media and onlookers jostled to catch a glance of the former premier. Some supporters of Najib's UMNO party chanted and held up placards in support of him.
Soon after coming into power in 2009, Najib founded 1MDB. The fund is being investigated in at least six countries on suspicion of money laundering.
SRC, created in 2011 by Najib's government to pursue overseas investment in energy resources, was a unit of 1MDB until it was moved to the finance ministry in 2012.
SRC has been the initial focus of Malaysian investigators as all the suspicious transactions involving the firm were made through Malaysian entities, unlike other 1MDB related transactions that went through foreign banks and companies.
A spokesman for Najib said on Tuesday that the SRC charges and the 1MDB investigations were “politically motivated”, and Najib will contest the charges and clear his name in court.
Mahathir told Reuters last month that embezzlement and bribery using government money were among the charges being considered against Najib, adding that his former protege was fully responsible for the 1MDB scandal.
Since his election loss, Najib has been barred from leaving the country and investigators have seized luxury handbags, jewellery and other items worth millions of dollars from properties linked to his family.

After signing an entry-level contract with the New York Rangers this summer, Russian goalie Alexandar Georgiev has finally played his first few games in a Rangers uniform. In this translated interview, originally appearing on the Russian website sport24.ru, Alexandar Georgiev talked about his NHL debut, his move to North America, and everyday life in New York.
* You can enjoy the original interview by Milana Mamayeva in the Russian language here. *
Georgiev and His First NHL Games
Milana Mamayeva: So, you're finally pushing Henrik Lundqvist into a pension?
Alexandar Georgiev: [laughs] It's early to talk like that. For now, I'm happy to have the trust of the coaches and to play for the Rangers. Lundqvist still has a long contract with the team.
MM: He's 36 already and won't get any younger.
AG: He's a very experienced player. I still have a lot to demonstrate.
MM: Recently, you stopped a penalty shot by Evgeni Malkin when the score was 3-3 [with] just 10 seconds to the end of the third period. Did you understand what you did?
AG: I didn't check the clock, but I knew that it was a key moment in the game. I tried to be focused as much as it was a normal one-on-zero.
MM: Did Malkin tell you anything after the game?
AG: Not really, we never talked.
MM: I've read that when you played for TPS in Finland you were always practicing the shootout with Mikko Koivu. Do you think that the shootouts are your strong point?
AG: I always tried to give as much attention as possible to the shootouts. I like going one-on-one. It's either you read what the player is going to do or the player himself needs to show something else. Shootouts are my favorite drills during practices.
MM: What did your teammates tell you after the win against the Penguins?
AG: The guys always support me. They told me that I was good and needed to keep on playing this way. After the save, half of the team celebrated me.
MM: After that save you said that you simply didn't buy Malkin's moves. How can you take yourself in hand when you are faced with such superstars?
AG: When those players are playing, I try to understand where they are, what they are going to do. Well, I also try to concentrate on my game.
Playing at the Madison Square Garden
MM: When you play in front of a packed 18,000-seat Madison Square Garden, is it easier thanks to the fans' support or harder due to the pressure?
AG: Of course there is a huge difference when you play in front of a packed arena or in an empty place. It's always pleasant to hear the public clapping their hands when you have a save.
MM: When you got to know that you were going to play your first NHL game against the Canadiens, what did you feel?
AG: I was told that I was going to play one day before the game. I told everyone right away (laughs). My father and my girlfriend were in the US. When they knew, they rented a car and got to Montreal. It's a six-hour drive from Hartford.
MM: Where are you shaking before your first game?
AG: Absolutely not! I long waited [for] that moment, and I was thinking during the practices that I was ready to play [in the NHL]. I tried not to think too much and to have a good debut.
MM: Were you upset after the loss?
AG: I was upset, but I tried to control my game. I allowed two goals, but I don't think that I had many mistakes. I think I played well, but unfortunately, I can't really control the way forwards play and that they need to score more goals than the opposition.
MM: Was your first NHL won in the game against the Oilers the biggest event in your career so far?
AG: It was a great game. I am glad that our players helped me a lot since the first minute, and we were always up in the score. They played well against McDavid and Draisaitl. I feel directly on myself that Connor can get a great pass out of nowhere and create a scoring chance.
Georgiev's Life in New York
MM: Are you often asked for an autograph in New York?
AG: In the US the Rangers have a lot of fans, not only in New York. When we played in Florida, half of the crowd was in a Rangers sweater. Before the games at home, there are always a lot of people who try to get close to the players and get a photo with them.
MM: Do you have your personal fans?
AG: Maybe, but I am not sure they exist or not. My relatives recently showed me that a person on Twitter has my picture as an avatar. But I haven't seen a fan with my jersey yet.
MM: Are the practices truly different in the US if compared with Finland or Russia?
AG: I can't say that it's radically different. It's up to the coach. Mostly it's pretty much the same. But to speak the truth, with the Rangers there are a lot of games and trips, therefore practicing is rare. In the AHL, games are mostly concentrated on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, therefore you can practice in the other days. The practices are usually one-hour-and-a-half long, while in the NHL the guys stay on the ice for 35 to 40 minutes.

MM: Where was it harder to adapt to the US?
AG: In day-to-day life there are a lot of differences. For example, here [in the US], to have lunch with a cap is normal, but in Russia you'd get told: “Are you crazy? You need to respect other people.”
MM: Now you're used to it?
AG: I can say that I have adapted now.
MM: How's your English?
AG: I don't have any problem with the English language. When I was young my parents sent me to a foreign languages school, I [have] freely (spoken) in English since I (was) 10.
Georgiev in the AHL
MM: You spent most of the season in the AHL. What surprised you the most?
AG: There are a lot of talented players, even (on) the fourth lines. The level of players and shots is very good. But, (on the other) hand, the hockey structure reminds of junior hockey; there are more runs for the puck, and less attention to the defensive game. In the Finnish league, the game is more structured, there is more attention to the tactical side of the game. To me, as a goalie, this is not something that has a lot of impact, the only difference is that here [in North America] there are more shots.
MM: Many say that it's better to play a lot of games in the AHL than being a backup in the NHL. Do you agree?
AG: I do, being in game shape is very important and I wanted to play as much as possible.
MM: Andrei Mironov, who recently got back to Russia, said that he was tired of living with his suitcases ready and always going up and down. How did you accept that?
AG: I was called up just twice, and the first time just for one day. But I am not scared of going up and down. I'm ready to play in the NHL even without any suitcase, if needed.
MM: How were you greeted when you got to the Rangers?
AG: It was great. All the guys are very friendly and helpful, no one ignored me just because I'm a rookie.
MM: Do you talk the most with Pavel Buchnevich and Vladislav Namestnikov?
AG: Yes, with them and with other young players with whom I played in the AHL. We try (to stay) together.
MM: How do you like New York?
AG: With any free day I try to discover something new. But I also think that you can spend your whole life studying New York without knowing it all anyway. I like that each borough has its history. At three minutes by feet from the Madison you have the Korean district, there are a lot of stores and restaurants there.
MM: Did other NHL teams invite you this summer, other than the Rangers?
AG: No one really invited me, and I couldn't just go to any team in America for camps. The Rangers were very interested in me, they even wanted to draft me, and they got to know that no other team wanted me, so they invited me and then even offered me a contract.
MM: Did you have any offer from Russia?
AG: I was under contract with TPS in Finland, so I could move to Russia just later. My number-one goal was to get to the NHL.
MM: Right now both Hartford and the Rangers are outside of the playoffs, [so] this means that you may be available for the IIHF WC in Denmark. Do you think you have a chance there?
AG: I'd be very glad to be called for Team Russia. But right now I try not to think about it. We'll see if we can get to the playoffs.
MM: How would you judge the chances for the Rangers to get to the playoffs?
AG: I think that considering the standings, the Rangers have like (a) one-percent (chance) to play in the playoffs. But as the saying goes, nothing is impossible, right?
Amy O is Amy Oelsner, a veteran DIY artist who's currently based in Bloomington, Indiana, and who's gearing up to release the new full-band album Elastic later this summer. Amy O impressed us with the dreamily energetic “Lavender Night,” the album's first single, and now she's followed it with “Sunday Meal,” a truly gorgeous piece of fuzz-pop that speeds up and slows down on its own schedule. The song crams a whole lot of feelings (about the death of Amy O's grandmother) and melodic ideas into its two minutes and 18 seconds. Below, listen to the song and read a quote about it from Amy O.
Amy O writes:
I wrote this upon returning home after spending a week in Connecticut watching my Grandma die in the summer of 2016. She was a sailor all her life, which inspired the line “She is calling me, come on home, steer the wheel along.” The whole experience made me think of home and all the forms it can take. The life I am building for myself is home, my childhood and the shared history I have with my family is home, my body is my home and I'm actually just a visitor here.
Elastic is out 8/4 on Winspear.
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's main monitoring group backed the official result of this week's ballot on Saturday as opposition anger at the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta erupted in the western city of Kisumu and slums ringing the capital, leading to two deaths.
In Nairobi, a young girl was shot dead by police firing "sporadic shots" at protesters in Mathare, a witness said. The run-down neighbourhood is loyal to opposition leader Raila Odinga, whose party has rejected the results of Tuesday's vote as a "charade".
A government official told reporters another man was killed in Kisumu county, centre of serious post-election ethnic violence in 2007 in which 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 displaced.
Kisumu's main hospital was treating four people brought in overnight with gun-shot wounds and six who had been beaten by police, hospital records showed.
One man, 28-year-old Moses Oduor, was inside his home in the impoverished district of Obunga when police barged in after midnight as part of house-to-house raids, dragging him out of his bedroom and laying into him with clubs.
"He was not out fighting them, he was rescued by my sister who lives next to him, she came outside screaming at the police asking why they are beating people," his brother, Charles Ochieng said, speaking on behalf of a dazed Oduor.
More shooting was heard outside the hospital on Saturday morning. In Nairobi, Kenyan television showed footage of armed police units backed by water cannon moving through the rubble-strewn streets of Kibera, another pro-Odinga Nairobi slum.
The election commission announced its official results late on Friday, giving 55-year-old Kenyatta another five years in power after securing 54.3 percent of votes cast.
Odinga's NASA coalition rejected the results even before they were announced, saying that the election commission's systems had been hacked, that the conduct of the count was irregular and that foreign observers who gave the poll a clean bill of health were biased.
However, the main monitoring group, ELOG, which had 8,300 observers on the ground, said its parallel vote tally conformed with the official outcome.
ELOG's projected outcome put Kenyatta on 54 percent, compared with the official figure of 54.3 percent. This was well within ELOG's 1.9 percent margin of error, the group said.
"We did not find anything deliberately manipulated," Regina Opondo, the chairwoman of ElOG's steering committee, told a news conference.
Angelina Jolie has hired a publicist before but she didn't like it. But it looks like she has changed her mind as she is reportedly seeking professional career makeover help. The "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" actress has been through tough times after she divorced from Brad Pitt in September 2016. She is now plotting her comeback with the help of top advisers among them Geyer Kosinski, her former manager.
Angelina Jolie has enlisted top career advisers before, Be Entertainment reported. The "Maleficent" star hired political advisers to help her before including Judy Smith, Washington D.C. crisis specialist, Lady Arminka Helic of the UK House of Lords and Chloe Dalton fellow Hague aide. These high profile advisers have helped the UN High Commissioners throughout the years and Angie has apparently sought help from them for her personal affairs.
Aside from these political advisers, Angelina Jolie has also asked the help of a friend and former manager Geyer Kosinski. He was the actress' manager till 2013 but remained close to her after they split. Reports said that she is desperate to hire a professional because her film "First They Killed My Father" is set to premiere soon. Angelina directed the film and is about the life of a Cambodian human rights activist.

Meanwhile, Angelina Jolie's new film is set to premiere Saturday and no other than Cambodia's King Norodom Sihamoni will be present, USA Today reported. Other royalties who will grace the premiere are Queen Mother Norodom Minineath Sihanouk and top government officials and will be held at the historic Angkor Wat temple.
There are reports that Angelina Jolie will be present with her Cambodian-born son Maddox at the event. The teen was said to have helped his mother on the film as well. "First They Killed My Father" was filmed in 2015 - 2016 and was Angelina's special project because of the actress' affinity for the country. The "Tomb Raider" actress has started her goodwill work in Cambodia in 2001 in behalf of the U.N. Maddox has been on the set of the movie almost every day after his classes and Angie plans to have him take over her foundation for Cambodia when he gets older.
COX'S BAZAR/DHAKA, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh is deploying thousands of extra police to Rohingya refugee camps in the south, officials said, after a series of mostly unexplained killings that have sown fear among hundreds of thousands of people who have fled from neighbouring Myanmar.

Since August, when a military crackdown in Myanmar forced many of the Muslim minority to cross the border into Bangladesh and seek shelter in the crowded camps, 19 people, some of them community leaders, have been killed.
Police have made a number of arrests in connection with some of the killings, but say the motives often remain unclear.
Conducted after dark and often by groups of men wielding pistols, knives, and sticks, the killings have sent a chill through the camps, which are guarded by the Bangladesh army during the day but manned by fewer police officers at night.
A.K.M. Iqbal Hossain, police superintendent of the coastal town of Cox's Bazar under whose jurisdiction the camps fall, said a special force of roughly 2,400 men was being formed to guard the refugees.
A second senior officer, Superintendent Afrujul Haque Tutul, said police numbers were already being increased.
“We have 1,000 police officers right now for a million people, so you can imagine,” he said.
More than 700,000 Rohingya have taken shelter in Cox's Bazar district since August, joining thousands who were already living there, making it the world's largest and fastest growing refugee camp.
Even before the August exodus, there had been violence in the camps, which Bangladesh police and aid workers have previously blamed on a struggle for control of supplies to the camps.
STABBED 25 TIMES
The latest killing, of 35-year-old Arifullah, took place last month on a busy road outside the Balukhali camp, where he had been appointed a leader of thousands of refugees.
A group of men surrounded him on the evening of June 18, stabbing him at least 25 times, police said. A pool of blood stained the spot the next morning, and a crowd of refugees could be seen gathered around.

Police said three Rohingya men had been arrested over the killing of Arifullah, who spoke English, had worked for international agencies in Myanmar, and often met foreign delegates who visited the camps.
His wife, who did not want to be named and asked Reuters not to disclose the location where she was interviewed because she feared attack, said Arifullah was a critic of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) – a militant group whose assaults on Myanmar security posts in August triggered the crackdown by the military.
The group says it is fighting for the rights of the Rohingya. Police said investigations into the murder were ongoing and they had not found links to ARSA.
A spokesman for ARSA referred Reuters to its Jan. 31 statement that said other armed groups were responsible for “activities” at refugee camps and were using its name to malign its image.
The group said it did not attack civilians and would never carry out killings in the camps because its was thankful for Bangladesh's generosity in sheltering the refugees.
That statement was issued after the Jan. 19 killing of Yusuf, another English-speaking camp leader. Sitting on the mud floor of her shelter, Yusuf's wife Jamila said her husband had been watching a football match on his phone with his two sons when around a dozen men barged into their shelter in the Taingkhali camp carrying knives and pistols, shooting him twice.
She said police had urged her to file a case and name suspects, but she had refused, fearing retaliation, and because she did not want to leave her shelter for hours to go to court. “I'm scared for my children,” she said.
Details of Yusuf's killing were confirmed by police superintendent Tutul at the Cox's Bazar police station. He said the police investigation was hampered because the refugees were afraid to name suspects.
He said intelligence received so far suggested several of the killings, including those of Yusuf and Arifullah, were due to personal disputes refugees had brought from Myanmar.
Police have arrested about 300 Rohingya in cases involving killings, robberies and abductions in the camps since the August influx, Tutul said.
Camp leaders at Balukhali and Taingkhali said the army had appointed Rohingya volunteers to keep guard at night, but most had stopped working because they were not being paid.
Foreign officials said security inside the teeming camps was a worry. “What I hear from my colleagues is that is obviously a big concern,” Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said on a visit to the camps on Sunday.
“It is obvious that it is a big challenge when you have big numbers, poor conditions, cramped situations.”

San Diego Chargers QB Philip Rivers says he's talked to Mike McCoy since the team let him go after the game on Sunday. Rivers says the players worked hard for McCoy, but the bottom line is the Chargers did not win enough games over the last two years. (0:35)
SAN DIEGO -- Players expressed some surprise but ultimately seemed resigned upon learning that the Chargers had fired coach Mike McCoy after the team's season-ending loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.
"It sucks," said guard Orlando Franklin, who played for McCoy when he served as offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos. "I have a lot of respect for Coach McCoy. He's a big reason why I came here to San Diego, being that we had that relationship when we were in Denver.
"It's unfortunate anytime someone gets fired in this league. But Coach McCoy is a great coach, and I'm pretty confident he'll have a job here in the next few days or couple weeks. So good luck to him and his family wherever he lands."
Editor's Picks Tampa Bay DC Mike Smith could make sense for Chargers The San Diego Chargers can begin the process of hiring the 16th head coach in franchise history. Here are five potential candidates.
Quarterback Philip Rivers spoke with McCoy since the announcement of his firing, wishing him well, and Rivers said if he had made a few more plays, perhaps McCoy would still be with the Chargers.
"Shoot, I thought Mike gave us a chance each and every week over the last four years," Rivers said. "He was consistent, and guys played hard for him. And we just didn't win enough games, especially in the last couple years.
"That's the reality of this league we're in. Shoot, Mike's still a young coach that's got a lot of years left in this league and will continue to be a heck of a coach."
As far as who will fill the head-coaching vacancy, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports that the Chargers have asked the New England Patriots for permission to interview defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. That interview likely would have to take place during the Patriots' playoff bye.
As Rivers has in the past, the QB said he will talk to the front office about potential hires but is not directly involved with the coaching search.
"My job is to play quarterback and to play it better than I played it this year," Rivers said. "So that's really as far as it goes. Are there conversations that you have? Certainly, I think over 13 years you earn at least that dialogue. But as far as being part of a search or heavily involved, I don't see that as my role."
Safety Jahleel Addae and defensive tackle Damion Square said they hope a new head coach keeps what the team has done well, including the retention of some of the assistants on staff so the Chargers retain some continuity during the offseason.
"Just a guy that establishes a great culture," Square said. "Culture is everything. When a good culture is in place, it takes care of a lot of things, from an injury standpoint to guys stepping in and playing at a high level.
"I think New England is one of those places like that; the organization is a winning culture. It's been established a long time ago. I think with any college or pro organization, you want someone who's going to be a leader and someone who wins more than they lose. You've got to start with culture. It's everything."
As it stands, whether the team relocates to Los Angeles or stays in San Diego, the offseason program is expected to remain at Chargers Park through June.
FORT MYERS, Fla. -- About a month ago, Minnesota Twins shortstop Jorge Polanco learned he had tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance.
The news of his 80-game suspension, including ineligibility for postseason play, hit the Twins hard on Sunday after their exhibition game.
"We don't want it in our game. We want a clean game. It sometimes is disappointing in seeing guys still trying to use performance-enhancing drugs," second baseman Brian Dozier said on Monday as the Twins started their final full week of spring training. "But at the same time, when it comes to a guy on my team, that's my brother. He needs love right now. That's the only thing I'm really worried about."
Now the Twins must concern themselves with Polanco's place in the lineup. He had a breakout second half of his first full season as the regular shortstop in 2017, batting .316 with 10 home runs and 42 RBIs over his last 55 games from Aug. 1 on while taking over the No. 3 spot in the batting order and helping the Twins reach the American League wild-card game.
Editor's Picks Twins SS Polanco given 80-game suspension Minnesota Twins shortstop Jorge Polanco has been suspended 80 games after testing positive for the performance-enhancing substance stanozolol.
Twins chief baseball officer Derek Falvey said shortstop is one of the positions he felt the team entered the spring with depth, including Eduardo Escobar, Ehire Adrianza and non-roster invitee Erick Aybar. The versatile Escobar, who played five different positions for the Twins last season, including one inning at catcher, is likely to be the primary option. Nobody has played more shortstop for the Twins since 2014 than Escobar, who hit 21 homers with 73 RBIs in 457 at-bats, all career highs.
"What Escobar did step up for us last season and we're going to ask him again, which is to step up and be a big part of this," Falvey said. "He's worn that jersey and been fine with that before. I think Adrianza is somebody we really liked last year when we got him and was somebody who could continue to progress and grow. So, between those two guys internally who are on the roster, we feel like those guys are in a great spot to step up for us."
Aybar, who has begun his 12th major league season, was signed to a minor league contract last month, before the Twins knew about Polanco's pending suspension. There's also some uncertainty about the availability of third baseman Miguel Sano, though to a much lesser degree than the half-season Polanco will be absent for. Sano is being investigated by Major League Baseball for alleged harassment of a freelance photographer after an autograph signing in 2015, and he's also recovering from surgery on his shin.
Then there's Nick Gordon, the fifth overall pick in the 2014 amateur draft who was at Double-A Chattanooga last season. He spent plenty of time at second base during spring training before being reassigned to minor league camp on Sunday shortly before news broke of Polanco's suspension, and Falvey said Gordon would continue to work out at shortstop, his original position.
As for Polanco, he decided to drop his appeal of the punishment on Sunday out of respect for the team so he'd begin serving it as soon as possible. Polanco met with reporters briefly on Monday before he had an opportunity to address his teammates. He'll continue to work out at the team's facility in Fort Myers when the team breaks camp and can play in extended spring training games with the minor leaguers.
"I know how everything happened," Polanco said. "I know the details, but today's not a day to discuss those things. Today's a day for me to be here in front of all of you guys and the Twins organization and my fans and just apologize."
In a statement distributed by the players' union on Sunday, Polanco said he didn't realize he'd consumed the banned substance Stanozolol, which came from a combination of vitamin B12 and an iron supplement supplied by his athletic trainer in his native Dominican Republic.
"My hope is that through this extremely disappointing situation other players will learn from my mistake," Polanco said in the statement.

MOSCOW (AP) — Russia has climbed out of recession despite the continuing Western sanctions, President Vladimir Putin said Thursday, adding that the restrictions have forced the country to "switch on our brains" to reduce its dependence on energy exports.
Speaking in a live call-in show televised nationwide, Putin deplored the U.S. Senate's decision Wednesday to impose new sanctions on Russia as a reflection of Western efforts to "contain" Russia but insisted that the measures only have made the country stronger.
The Republican-led Senate voted Wednesday to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2016 election by approving a wide-ranging package of sanctions that targets key sectors of Russia's economy and individuals who carried out cyberattacks.
The Senate bill follows up on several rounds of other sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union over Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and its support for pro-Russia insurgents in eastern Ukraine.
Putin argued that Russia has done nothing to warrant the Senate's move, saying it highlights the West's policy of containing Russia and also reflects domestic infighting in the United States.
"It's evidence of a continuing internal political struggle in the U.S.," he said.
Putin said that the sanctions have given Russia an incentive to shed its dependence on oil and gas exports and "switch on our brains and talents" to develop other industries. He emphasized that electronics, aerospace industries and agriculture have all received a boost.
Russia has responded to the U.S. and EU sanctions by halting most Western food imports, a move that has helped increase Russian agricultural output.
Russian farmers have pleaded with the Kremlin to keep the import ban even if the West lifts its sanctions, but Putin said that if "our partners lift the sanctions against our economy, we will respond in kind."
The Russian leader claimed that the "crisis is over," pointing at modest economic growth over the past nine months, low inflation and rising currency reserves.
Putin said that a slump in oil prices had been a more important factor in Russia's economic slowdown than the sanctions.
He acknowledged that the Russian economy hasn't yet shed its dependence on exports of raw materials, but noted that non-energy exports have been growing.
Putin recognized that people's incomes have fallen and 13.5 percent of Russians now live below the poverty line.
(Reuters) - Standard Chartered on Tuesday raised its 2018 crude oil price forecasts by $10 saying that the market has begun to acknowledge the importance of OPEC-led production cuts.

The British bank, which revised its forecasts for the first time in almost a year, saw Brent and WTI crude prices averaging $71 a barrel and $68 a barrel respectively this year.
It also raised its 2019 price outlook by $13 with Brent oil seen averaging $75 a barrel and WTI $71.
“OPEC and its non-OPEC partners are now receiving greater acknowledgment for market discipline, views of shale oil economics are no longer the most important price-setting factor, and demand pessimism is significantly reduced,” the bank said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia have agreed to cap output by about 1.8 million bpd in a deal running from January last year until the end of 2018.
OPEC oil output fell in March to an 11-month low due to declining Angolan exports, Libyan outages and a further slide in Venezuelan output, a Reuters survey found earlier this month, sending compliance with a supply-cutting deal to another record.
Oil prices were little changed on Tuesday after Brent hit its highest level since November 2014, supported by strong demand, OPEC-led production cuts, and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. [O/R]
“Should the U.S. waiver on certain sanctions on Iran not be renewed in May, we are likely to roll our forecast back to where it was two years ago, to $75 per barrel,” the bank said.
Maps from “They Shall Not Pass,” a DLC package released last March for “Battlefield 1” will be released for all players, developer DICE announced today. Additionally, with the launch of the expansion “Apocalypse” on March 6, the game's monthly updates will soon come to an end.
Starting today, the map “Rupture” is now available for all players owning a copy of the game. Next month, more maps from “They Shall Not Pass” will be made available, DICE said.
Rupture takes place during the Second Battle of the Marne, and allows for game modes like Team Deathmatch, War Pigeons, Conquest, and Domination.
A new game mode will launch for “Battlefield 1” in June, the developer added. Called “Shock Operations,” the new mode “supports 40 players and sees attackers and defenders battling over sectors” of a singular map. Shock Operations will be available on the following in-game maps: Giant's Shadow, Prise de Tahure, Lupkow Pass, Zeebrugge, and River Somme. Though some of these maps are typically only available to players with the “Battlefield 1 Premium Pass,” DICE did say they'll be available to everyone while playing the new game mode.
And lastly, monthly updates will still be coming to “Battlefield 1” – for a few months. Until June 2018, DICE is promising to support the game with new content and tweaks and fixes to the game. Though it looks like DICE is getting ready to move full-time support over to the next “Battlefield” game – reported taking place during World War II – it's probably safe to assume the developer will still update the game in some capacity with patches and bug fixes going forward, just less frequently.
“Battlefield 1,” released October 21, 2016, was a radical shift for the 16 year old series. Typically focused on modern combat and warfare in later entries in the series, the most recent iteration took place during the first World War. This change proved to be a success for DICE and publisher EA, as the game's sold an estimated 15 million copies.

They called it Victory Veg for a reason.
After years of the daily grind in the mainstream workforce, a Beachville couple said they are delighted to be able to return to their farming roots.
Jeff and Lesley Lucassen, who met and married while working Great Northern Insulation in Woodstock, quit their jobs a couple years back to start a market garden and farm stand on land he grew up on.
“We wanted to get outdoors more and work for ourselves and serve the community,” Jeff said. “If we can make a living while people are eating healthy and supporting local (we are happy).”
The roughly 300-acre farm, which Jeff's parents once operated as a dairy farm, was purchased by his Dutch grandparents who immigrated to the region in the 1940's.
Some of the Karn Road farm, located near Beachville, is now home to a massive market garden complete with almost every type of seasonal vegetable going.
The couple, both in their thirties, said they love spending their days working on their land instead of toiling for others.
“It doesn't matter how many hours I work, being able to do what I love to do instead of being in an office is so nice,” Leslie said. “I love being outside and hearing the birds.”
Back in the winter of 2016, after saving up for a long time, they developed their vision and implemented a plan for the garden.
Two years later the garden has grown as they conquer challenges that every farmer faces including getting people to know they are there.
“Getting the word out is really tough,” Lesley said.
This springs hot, dry weather was also a challenge for vegetables that prefer cooler weather.
“We missed spring,” Leslie said.
Eventually they hope to operate year-round with a storefront, as they continue to grow and welcome new clients.
Currently they offer pre-paid community-supported agriculture memberships that provide participants with a weekly large-or-small box of their freshest produce over a 20-week period.
“We focus on seasonal varieties,” Jeff said.
Weekly on-demand boxes are also available complete with veggies, herbs and fruits.
They also accept custom orders and offer free-range brown eggs for purchase on the farm.
You can visit Victory Veg at the Ingersoll Farmers' Market Saturday morning, stop by their Karn Road location or visit their Facebook page Victory Veg.

When Oakman Inns was founded 12 years ago by its CEO, Peter Borg-Neal, his vision was that he would not only create a highly-regarded, very successful business but that Oakman Inns would be a sustainable organisation that would contribute to its local community rather than exploit it.
Oakman, which runs the White Hart in Ampthill, is ditching plastic straws this weekend.
Peter Borg-Neal CEO of Oakman Inns
As the company's many awards and accolades testify, Oakman has consistently achieved those aims. However, over the years that vision has broadened to encompass a much more holistic approach to sustainability and the Oakman team always believes there is more to do.
Which is why My Borg-Neal and his colleagues are launching their own BAN THE STRAW campaign - #banthestraw - on Earth Day this Saturday April 22, declaring “we believe straws suck”.
The company currently uses over 100,000 plastic straws a month across its 17-strong group. While the company is highly-rated by The Sustainable Restaurant Association for its many green policies including plastic, glass and container recycling, the sheer number of straws consumed had begun to be a concern.
“Our monthly straw consumption sounds enormous, but compared to the estimated 500m straws that are used and discarded in the USA every day, it's still a hugely dangerous and an everlasting drop in the ocean. And that is rather the point, “explains Peter. “It sounds ridiculous, but it is entirely accurate to say, that every plastic straw that was ever made, still exists today. They pollute landfills, rivers, roadsides, sewers, beaches and of course oceans and this relatively small amount that this pub group is taking out of circulation, needs to be repeated by every one of my colleagues across the hospitality industry.”
If customers ask for a straw, they will, of course, be offered an eco-friendly alternative, as Oakman is entirely sympathetic to their customers' wishes.
Alex Ford, Oakman's operations director, said; “From 2020, all plastic cutlery and plates will be banned in France. Bangladesh was the first country in the world in 2002 to ban plastic shopping bags and California banned single-use plastic bags in 2014. Yes, the UK has introduced a charge for plastic carrier bags and has banned microbeads, the tiny plastic balls used in cosmetics and cleaning products, but I believe we all have to do more. Because pretty soon, every fish we eat will have ingested some plastic and that will become a truly global environmental disaster that will probably be impossible to solve.”
Peter added: “At Oakman we try to live by our values every day, and we hope that those values and our commitment to sustainability means that everyone here is contributing to a better future for us all.”
ROUYN NORANDA, Que. — A barber from western Quebec is drawing widespread praise for going out of his way to accommodate a young client with autism.
A photo posted online last week shows Francis "Franz" Jacob lying on the floor of his Rouyn-Noranda shop as he gives a young boy named Wyatt a haircut.
The 45-year-old says he's stunned by all the attention he's gotten after the photo was widely shared on social media sites.
Jacob says Wyatt doesn't usually sit still for haircuts so he bought a pair of wireless clippers in order to follow him around.
TAMPA, Fla. -- Tampa Bay Buccaneers starting left tackle Donovan Smith can now see what all the fuss is about when it comes to Disney movies. The Walt Disney Co. got word that Smith hadn't seen "The Lion King" and set out to rectify the situation, sending a package to One Buc Place on Friday.
It was filled with DVDs, including "The Lion King," "Frozen," "Bambi," "Pinocchio" and "The Jungle Book," among others. Inside the package was a handwritten note that read, "Heard you haven't seen many of our films. Hope this package gets your teammates off your back."
It's been a hot topic around One Buc Place for months. Offensive guard/tackle Caleb Benenoch even created an online poll in which 80 percent of participants said that it was "not OK" that he hadn't seen the Disney classic about the adventures of a young lion named Simba.
It even played out on HBO's "Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers." In one of the funnier scenes, Smith was in the training room getting ridiculed by teammates because he didn't know what "Hakuna Matata" meant.
Smith admitted, "I really have never seen 'The Lion King.'"
Center Joe Hawley asked, "Have you seen any movies? Give us a childhood movie you saw."
Offensive guard Kevin Pamphile chimed in: "He's never seen 'Aladdin.'"
Winston asked: "'Matilda'?"
Smith responded, "I've seen 'Matilda.' I haven't seen 'Aladdin.' I've seen 'Toy Story' ... I haven't seen 'Winnie the Pooh.'"
Hawley said, "'Toy Story' is great. You've saved your face a little bit."
The Bucs are coming off a Thursday night game, which means Smith now has three full days to restore his childhood, get over Mufasa's passing and discover the meaning behind "what a wonderful phrase."

Troy High students gather in Flint to meet the students at a Flint high school after they raised money to assist them because of the water crisis. Troy High is raising money this year to supply 1,000 Flint elementary school students with personal hygiene products. Photo courtesy of Troy School District
Students at Troy Athens and Troy High School are putting each other in jail, dressing up for spirit days, holding penny wars and more to raise money to help others this month.
Troy Highs annual Activist Week is Feb. 5-9. This year, the students want to help 1,000 children at two Flint Elementary schools. They hope to fill two buses, one with hygiene items like soaps and toothbrushes and the other filled with Troy High students to personally deliver them.
Troy students have planned restaurant fundraisers, spirit days, donation competitions between the classes, a Mr. Troy competition and a Snowcoming dance to raise money.
Two years ago, Troy High School created a fundraiser to help out with the crisis in Flint, MI by adopting Northwestern High School, the Troy students GoFundMe page explained. Through a variety of activities and fundraisers, we were able to put together 500 bath packs filled with many basic hygienic and sanitary products for the students at Northwestern, as well as supply a food bank in the city and provide a gift card for each graduating senior. Now, years later, the crisis in Flint is not over. It may not be talked about anymore, but the people there still need help.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank on Wednesday tightened rules on banks' statutory auditors saying it reserved the right to not approve appointments of such auditors for a specified period if their audit quality was not found satisfactory.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it will take action against statutory auditors of banks in case of any lapses in their auditing process including instances such as misstatement of a bank's financial statement or wrong information in audit report.
The banking regulator came out with these guidelines after a recent $2 billion fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank revealed several lapses in the auditing process in banks.
“The framework would cover, inter alia, instances of divergence identified in asset classification and provisioning during the RBI inspection vis-à-vis the audited financial statements of banks,” said RBI in a statement.

NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - An upscale New Jersey town violated anti-discrimination laws by insisting that a proposed mosque have more parking spaces than churches or synagogues because of its unique worship times and traditions, a federal judge has ruled.
The ruling issued Saturday by U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp stated that Bernards Township violated the Religious Land Use and Institutional Persons Act by applying a different standard to Muslims.
Shipp found the township's planning board had “unbridled and unconstitutional discretion” because of its vague parking requirements.
The Islamic Society's application to build the mosque was denied after more than three years and 39 public hearings. The group sued the township in March.
The Islamic Society's attorney, Adeel Mangi, had argued that parking requirements were the tool municipalities used to thwart construction of mosques.
“This truly is a landmark ruling with national impact,” Mangi told NJ.com.
Bernards Mayor Carol Bianchi issued a statement criticizing the judge's ruling. The town had argued that it was completely appropriate to insist a mosque provide more off-street parking than a comparably sized church or synagogue because of its unique worship times and traditions.
“The Township vehemently disagrees with the court's decision and awaits a full analysis of the 57-page decision by its attorneys, who only learned of the decision on New Year's Day,” the statement said. “The Township will consider how to the best move forward including appealing the decision when ripe for appeal.”
The mosque has said its peak worship time was likely Friday afternoon prayers. Township planners determined that because congregants would most likely be arriving straight from work, every worshipper would require a parking space.
Shipp, though, noted that the township had not conducted individual assessments of worship habits when churches or synagogues came before its boards. By its own admission, the town applied a different standard to Muslims, he wrote.
Shipp did not take into account the sentiments expressed in emails from township officials that were revealed in documents filed in the case, Mangi noted. In those, officials disparaged the Islamic Society's president, former mayor Mohammed Ali Chaudry, and passed around jokes calling President Barack Obama a Muslim.

SCRANTON — The Little Sisters of the Poor, who have served in the Diocese of Scranton for 110 years, are withdrawing from the Holy Family Residence in Scranton.
The announcement came today from Mother Mary Alice, the Little Sisters' provincial superior.
In a statement, she said the decision was part of a strategic plan aimed at strengthening the order's ministry. The Little Sisters are actively seeking a buyer for the Holy Family Residence, according to the announcement.
In a statement, Bishop Joseph C. Bambera said:
“For more than 100 years, the Little Sisters of the Poor have provided compassionate, loving care to countless numbers of elderly and infirmed residents from throughout the Diocese of Scranton.
Although Holy Family Residence is not a Diocesan facility, the Little Sisters have tirelessly fulfilled the mission of the Church by providing for those in need of their care with a particular commitment to serving the poor in an atmosphere of respect, dignity, and love.
While there is sadness that the Sisters will no longer be able to continue their ministry in the Diocese of Scranton, we give thanks for their witness and dedicated service to the people of our region.”

A number of shifts in thought have occurred in relation to early human migrations during the last several months, which include questions about when, precisely, the ancestors of modern humans first left Africa, and began to populate other parts of the world.
For some time, consensus opinion on this has held that a single migration occurred, where early humans left Africa around 60,000 years ago, spreading into parts of Asia, and outward to other regions from there.
However, some parts of this ancient story, generally called the “Out of Africa” theory, are changing based on new evidence of different migrational paths, as well as migrations which occurred much earlier than previously determined.
A study appearing in the journal Science recently suggested that several migrations out of Africa led to the dispersal of modern humans, rather than a single migration that occurred en masse. In just the last decade, scientists had begun to accept that migrations out of Africa might have begun as early as 120,000 years ago, placing them twice as early as originally thought. Now, fossil evidence found in parts of central and south China seem to support the idea of numerous successive migrations out of Africa, although it is still believed that a larger migration did occur around 60,000 years ago.
Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History said in a press statement that, “A later, major ‘Out of Africa' event most likely occurred around 60 000 years ago or thereafter,” which remains in keeping with long-held ideas about human migrations around that time in history.
It is suggested that future explorations of remote parts of the world, particularly in parts of Asia, paired with new models for early migrations of humans out of Africa, may lead to a clearer picture of humankind's early origins.
Few would argue that 2017 has been a tremendous year for discoveries about human origins, with a number of surprises, and instances where history has been re-written.
These discoveries range from controversial claims of neanderthal presence in North America as early as 130,000 years ago, to more acceptable assertions, like the appearance of modern humans in much earlier times than once thought.
Jonathan Davies must prove his fitness in training today to be able to stake a British and Irish Lions Test match claim in Saturday's Maori clash.
Wales powerhouse Davies is the favourite to wear the Lions' 13 shirt in the first Test against the All Blacks on June 24.
The 29-year-old suffered a head injury in the Lions' 12-3 Crusaders win on Saturday, however, and missed Tuesday's 23-22 loss to the Highlanders. Now the Lions hope the in-form Scarlets star can complete the return-to-play protocols in time for Saturday's Maori All Blacks clash in Rotorua – where the tourists are likely to field a line-up close to their Test XV.
“Jonathan is still going through protocols but hopefully he'll be back in training (on Thursday) and we'll see from there,” said Lions assistant coach Neil Jenkins, who also hopes Ross Moriarty will beat a back spasm before Saturday.
“Ross has been back in training doing a little bit of running, and hopefully he'll come through as well.”
Courtney Lawes suffered a nasty-looking head knock in Tuesday's Highlanders loss, with Jenkins admitting the England lock is unlikely to recover in time to feature this weekend.
“Courtney's been okay today but it's the same as always with head injuries – the protocols and see how he goes for the rest of the week,” said Jenkins.
“He's a tough old character, he wanted to walk off the pitch, albeit with a bit of help. But the likelihood is he will miss the weekend.”
Tour captain Sam Warburton returned from ankle trouble to start the Dunedin defeat to the Highlanders, as he steps up his bid to be ready for the three-Test All Blacks series.
The Lions have two more matches before taking on New Zealand in the series opener in Auckland, with Warburton battling against time to force his way into that starting XV.
England coach Eddie Jones will announce his team for the second Test against Argentina today and it looks likely he will make at least two changes.
Former captain Chris Robshaw is set to win his 56th cap after missing the opening game with an ankle injury while fly-half or centre Piers Francis is poised to make his first start after coming on as a substitute in San Juan.
Francis, who turns 27 next Tuesday, joined the England camp on the eve of the tour from Auckland, where he plays for the Blues, and missed the chance to play against the Lions.

A lawsuit against the Justice Department has revealed new details about the infamous tarmac meeting between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton.
Due to Freedom of Information Act request from the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), the DOJ released 413 pages of documents related to the June 27, 2016 meeting.
The documents revealed that reporters were reluctant to cover the the meeting, and also that Lynch used an alias for official DOJ emails, including those related to the meeting.
Jay Sekulow, an attorney for President Trump and chief counsel for the ACLJ, said the documents also show that there were email exchanges between the FBI and the DOJ, and the DOJ and the White House, regarding the controversial meeting.

Confirmed: Police Told to Stand Down in Charlottesville—Did Nothing as War Broke Out
August 13, 2017
Charlottesville, VA — The events that unfolded in Charlottesville, Virginia this Saturday were tragic, hateful, insidious and even deadly. Saturday will go down in history as the day America's hate reared its ugly face and proved to the world that this country is being divided — to be conquered. Adding fuel to the fire of hatred and violence were politicians who told police not to intervene and allowed the unchecked carnage to unfold before their eyes.
The stand down was confirmed by the ACLU who quoted a police source saying, “We'll not intervene until given command to do so.”

CNN Ditches Its Polling Firm of More Than 10 Years Amid ‘Fake News' Charges
August 12, 2017
CNN announced that after ten years, it parted ways this week with its longtime polling firm, ORC International, amid charges of fake news and faulty polls.
ORC's chief marketing officer Ana Mackay-Sim confirmed that CNN “did not renew their polling contract” with ORC International. The polling firm worked with CNN since 2006 and had continued their partnership after the 2016 presidential election until late April.
“We are thankful for the opportunity we have had to partner with CNN in the past and wish them well in their future polling work,” Mackay-Sim told Politico. “We have no further comment at this time.”
CNN has, instead, decided to switch to the major survey-research firm SSRS.

North Korea's Missile Success Is Linked to Ukrainian Plant, Investigators Say
August 14, 2017
North Korea's success in testing an intercontinental ballistic missile that appears able to reach the United States was made possible by black-market purchases of powerful rocket engines probably from a Ukrainian factory with historical ties to Russia's missile program, according to an expert analysis being published Monday and classified assessments by American intelligence agencies.
The studies may solve the mystery of how North Korea began succeeding so suddenly after a string of fiery missile failures, some of which may have been caused by American sabotage of its supply chains and cyberattacks on its launches. After those failures, the North changed designs and suppliers in the past two years, according to a new study by Michael Elleman, a missile expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Such a degree of aid to North Korea from afar would be notable because President Trump has singled out only China as the North's main source of economic and technological support. He has never blamed Ukraine or Russia, though his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, made an oblique reference to both China and Russia as the nation's “principal economic enablers” after the North's most recent ICBM launch last month.
Analysts who studied photographs of the North's leader, Kim Jong-un, inspecting the new rocket motors concluded that they derive from designs that once powered the Soviet Union's missile fleet. The engines were so powerful that a single missile could hurl 10 thermonuclear warheads between continents.

MSM Spins Tragic News Just As Washington Declares WAR ON BITCOIN
August 13, 2017
Bitcoin is targeted, so stack up on gold & silver before things really get out-of-hand! Here's the latest on the battles against cryptocurrencies.
The United States has Bitcoin firmly under a microscope. From ledger data, server traffic, hardware and software penetrative capabilities, network intercepts, and it's all fresh off the presses. There's more to it than that, especially since I'm a tech expert, however, I want people to read this very important information, not lull themselves to sleep on some boring techno-academia, so we'll go light on tech and heavy on governmental burden, and this one shall be just fine.
This War on Bitcoin gets worse. This war is in the name of combating terrorism through illicit Bitcoin use. ‘Merica is bringin' down the hammer on cryptos.
Goldbugs and silverbugs rejoice: we live to fight another day. Our powder is dry, and regardless of what happens, the gold and silver you can reach and touch at a moments notice, it seems, right now, is better than any digital, un-backed fiat currency that depends on a complex system prone to outages and failures. Yes I get it. People say “it's backed because it is digitally mined, solving complex math problems that prove it has to perform math to mine. This is indeed true.

One Dead, Multiple Injured After Car Rams Through Pizzeria In France
August 14, 2017
A young girl has died and multiple others have been seriously injured after a car is said to have intentionally rammed through a pizzeria in the French town of Sept-Sorts.
UPDATE 17:38 EST: Initial reports stated that the age of the girl killed was eight-years-old. New reports say this is incorrect and that she is actually twelve according to L'Express. Authorities have also stated that the man involved attempted to kill himself on Sunday. The investigation has been passed on to the gendarmes and is still ongoing.
UPDATE 16:45 EST: Police now claim that the suspect in the incident is totally “unknown” to both police and the French intelligence services.
UPDATE 16:20 EST: According to French broadcaster RTL police are saying the man wanted to commit suicide, had weapons in his vehicle and is 39-years-old. Authorities are saying the motive for the act is not terrorism according to early investigations. Five of those injured in the attack remain in critical condition.

On Monday, officials backed away from reports that he was the principal suspect.

Peru's attorney general has ordered the arrest of two suspects in the killing of a Vancouver Island man who travelled to the Amazon rainforest to study hallucinogenic medicine, officials said Monday.
Authorities said over the weekend that a mob dragged Sebastian Woodroffe by the neck to his death shortly after people accused him of killing Olivia Arevalo, an octogenarian plant healer from the Shipibo-Konibo tribe of northeastern Peru.
Prosecutors said Monday the two suspects were identified in a video shot on a cellphone showing the moment Woodroffe, who was 41, was killed last week.
Officials said forensic experts were studying Woodroffe's body to determine whether he had any involvement in Arevalo's killing, as was initially suggested. On Monday, officials backed away from reports that he was the principal suspect.
Arevalo and Woodroffe were both killed Thursday in the Indigenous community of Victoria Gracia, officials said. But police did not begin to investigate until a cellphone video appeared in local media showing a man purported to be Woodroffe begging for mercy while being dragged between thatch-roofed homes. He was then left motionless on the muddy ground.
On Saturday, officials dug up Woodroffe's body from an unmarked grave where he had been hastily buried.
Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman Brianne Maxwell said Monday the department was aware of the case and had been in touch with the man's family and Peruvian officials but no further information would be provided due to privacy concerns.
Every year thousands of foreign tourists travel to the Peruvian Amazon to experiment with ayahuasca — a bitter, dark-coloured brew made of a mixture of native plants.
The hallucinogenic cocktail, also known as yage, has been venerated for centuries by indigenous tribes in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia as a cure for all sorts of ailments. It's also increasingly consumed by Western tourists looking for mind-altering experiences, sometimes with deadly consequences.
Arevalo was a staunch defender of Indigenous people's rights in the region. She also practised a traditional form of singing medicine that the Shipibo believe removes negative energies from individuals.
Woodroffe, who was from Cumberland on Vancouver Island, said before going to Peru that he hoped an apprenticeship with a plant healer from the Shipibo tribe would help his goal of changing careers to become an addiction counsellor using hallucinogenic medicine.
“A recent family intervention for a relative with an alcohol addiction has opened my eyes to what I should be doing for work,” he wrote on the Indiegogo crowd-funding website seeking financial help to advance his studies.
“The plant medicine I have the opportunity of learning is far deeper than ingesting a plant and being healed. It is not about getting ‘high' either. It is true some of the plants I will be learning about do have a perception-altering effect, but these are a few plants out of thousands I will be working with,” he said.
Friends of Woodroffe have posted messages of condolences on social media pages, and Woodroffe's Facebook profile has changed to ‘Remembering Sebastian Woodroffe.'
Yarrow Willard, a close friend of Woodroffe, said in a Facebook message he was a loving father and kind man, “who was not capable of the crimes he was accused of.”
Friend Brodie Dawson echoed Willard's statement.
“(Sebastian) was well-loved in the community and he was a sweet and loving person, and … this was very out of character for him,” she noted.

South Korean taekwondo athletes have performed for Pope Francis, after a planned show of Korean unity at the Vatican fell apart when the North pulled out at the last minute.
Pope Francis didn't seem to notice or mind, thanking the athletes Wednesday for their exhibition “which was a show of the will for peace, the two Koreas together.”
South Korea's World Taekwondo organization, the Seoul-led international body, said last week that a demonstration team from the North withdrew from the performance over the U.S.-South Korean military drills.
The performance had been planned to ceremonially open the World Taekwondo's Grand Prix competition this week in Rome.
The South's team performed for thousands of people in St. Peter's Square and featured a young girl releasing a dove in a sign of peace.

Investigators say a man who was attempting to stop two thieves from stealing his car was gunned down after firing warning shots in the air.
The North Charleston Police Department has charged 17-year-old Bobby Cason and 20-year-old Brandon Meyers, both from North Charleston, with murder and attempted grand larceny.
Both are expected in bond court at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.
Detectives say they learned that the suspects went to the Park at Rivers Edge neighborhood to steal the victim's vehicle because they had the keys from a previous break-in.
According to a report, the suspects were in the process of stealing the vehicle when the victim came out with his gun and fired two warning shots in the air.
Police say it was at that point the victim was shot.
"The suspects fled the area eluding police and eventually crashing in to several cars in the Forest Hills 2 neighborhood before being captured," said Spencer Pryor with North Charleston police.
Initial Response
Police responded at about 1 a.m. to the 7000 block of Park Gate Drive to investigate reports of shots fired.
"Responding officers heard gunfire as they approached the location and saw the suspect vehicle roll backward into a yard then flee the scene," Pryor said.
Officers found a male victim lying in the yard suffering from a wound. That victim was pronounced dead at the scene, Pryor said.
During the search for suspects, police were notified about a vehicle traveling on the opposite side of Dorchester Road, which led to a chase, he said.
The suspect vehicle crashed into four vehicles and the pair then fled on foot before being captured in the area of Buck Pond Road and Rosin Drive, Pryor said.
"My nerves are finally calming down,” said Esther Courtney, of North Charleston. “It was very nerve racking."
Courtney said she was shocked when she found surveillance videos on her computer which she believes captured the arrest of one of the suspects by North Charleston Police.
"We saw an officer right outside our window here by the tree trying to peek up over the fence," she said.
The search for the two suspects came after the car they were driving fled the shooting scene on Park Gate Drive.
Pryor said they fled to the Forest Hills 2 neighborhood, crashed into four vehicles on Buck Pond Road, then fled on foot.
"It's terrifying,” said Brenda Everett, who lives on the street. “But as I said, it's very quiet here... and it was just really frightening."
Courtney believes one of the suspects hopped over the fence from Buck Pond Road to Brookdale Boulevard before hiding under the pool deck for several hours before he was apprehended by police.
"[The police had] me lower my windows and look[ed] in the back,” said Avis Johnson, who lives on Brookdale Boulevard. “I get to school 12 minutes away and she says, he's in our driveway. So the chain of events has just blown me away."
Homeowners in the area said a helicopter started circling their neighborhood shortly after the crash.
Surveillance cameras captured the light from the chopper as it flew over houses.
"The helicopter kept getting closer, and when it got close enough that it was very loud, I went back in the house," Everett said.
"It was circling, and every time it circled my windows shook,” Johnson said. “So I realized it was getting lower."

Katherine Heigl considered quitting Hollywood after rumours of her difficult reputation began.
The actress hit headlines after starring in 2007 comedy Knocked Up, where she played successful E! News presenter Alison who has her world turned upside down when she falls pregnant after a one-night stand with Seth Rogen's stoner character Ben.
Katherine later upset Seth and the film's director Judd Apatow when she called the comedy film “a little sexist”, telling Vanity Fair back in 2008: “Ninety-eight per cent of the time it was an amazing experience, but it was hard for me to love the movie.”
Katherine also faced a backlash for declining to submit any of her work from U.S. TV medial drama Grey's Anatomy episodes for Emmy consideration in 2008, releasing a statement criticising the material she had been given. “I did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination,” she said in the statement.
Despite later apologizing for her gaffes, Katherine struggled to come to terms with the criticism and has revealed in a new interview that she even considered quitting acting.
“Maybe everybody in their career feels that way, especially when you've been at it for a really long time,” the 38-year-old told the Press Association. “You have these ups and downs and these ebbs and flows.
“This thing you were once so passionate about and was your heart and soul has now turned on you and it's your mortal enemy instead of your best friend. I think that's pretty typical of most people.”
The mother-of-three added she often overanalysed her previous interviews to see how she could have been misconstrued as being difficult. “Nobody wants to hear things like that about themselves,” she said. “One thing I think I'm relatively good at is asking myself and truly addressing; ‘Is there an issue here?'
“You have to be accountable for your behaviour. Now maybe I go a little too far in beating myself up, or self evaluation, or not trusting my own instincts.”
Katherine has since buried the hatchet with her Knocked Up co-star Seth and director Judd, and even considered working with them again on a sequel to the hit comedy.
“Wouldn't that be fun? What do you think that looks like? (Ben and Alison) 10 years later. Do they have more children? Have they made it? Are they still together?” Katherine said.
“Maybe they're getting separated. That would be depressing though. I wouldn't want to see that one.”

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities are close to fully identifying the terrorist responsible for an attack at a popular Istanbul venue which killed 39 people on Sunday and have detained eight other people, the government's spokesman said on Monday.
“Information about the fingerprints and basic appearance of the terrorist have been found. In the process after this, work to identify him swiftly will be carried out,” Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told a news conference.
He said it was clear that Turkey's military incursion into Syria, launched in August, had annoyed terror groups and those behind them, but said the offensive would continue until all threats to Turkey were removed.

Turkey sent tanks and special forces into Syria just over four months ago to push back Islamic State terrorists from its border and prevent Kurdish militia fighters from taking ground in their wake.
Kurtulmus also said Sunday's attack bore significant differences to previous attacks in Turkey and that it had been carried out to create divisions within Turkish society.

As USA Swimming Grapples With Sexual Abuse, Athletes Cite Lack Of Female Coaches
Enlarge this image toggle caption Ted S. Warren/AP Ted S. Warren/AP
Congressional committees have been looking into the issue of sexual abuse in Olympic sports, with a particular focus on gymnastics. Now stories of alleged abuse are emerging in swimming. Last month, former Olympic athlete Ariana Kukors Smith sued her former coach, Sean Hutchinson, for allegedly abusing her. She also sued USA Swimming and the U.S. Olympic Committee because she says they failed to protect her.
Today, there are more than 150 coaches on USA Swimming's permanently banned list. Almost all are men, most of whom the organization has deemed to have violated its code of conduct, including a section that prohibits "any inappropriate sexually oriented behavior or action."
Chris DeSantis, a swim coach in New Jersey, says the actual number is probably much higher than the public list would suggest: "I would estimate the actual number of coaches who have done something that they should be banned for is north of 1,000."
Hutchison, the coach, denies Kukors Smith's allegation. "I absolutely deny having any sexual or romantic relationship with her before she was old enough to legally make those decisions for herself. Prior to that time, I did nothing to 'groom' her," Hutchison said in a statement, according to the The Seattle Times. "I deeply regret that she would make these wild allegations all these years later."
USA Swimming did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Earlier this year, USA Swimming CEO Tim Hinchey sent a letter to its members reading, in part "Let me be clear: USA Swimming does not tolerate sexual abuse or misconduct, and I assure you that this organization is facing this extremely serious issue with one very clear goal – protecting children and athletes."
"We will not shy away from acknowledging or supporting survivors of abuse, and we will strive to ensure that there is never a lapse of a support system again," the letter continues.
There are also coaches who have been publicly accused of assault who are not on the banned list. Sarah Ehekircher accused her swim coach Scott McFarland of misconduct more than two decades ago.
McFarland said that two had a consensual relationship when Ehekircher was 18 and they were both living in Colorado. But she said he first sexually assaulted her on a trip to California when she was 17. After a hearing conducted in 2010, USA Swimming did not discipline him.
She wonders if having more female leadership at the club would have changed things. "Specifically for me," she says, "I think I would have had someone to go to."
There are very few female swim coaches at the elite level. It wasn't until 2012 that a woman — Teri McKeever, who coached at the University of California for more than 25 years — was appointed to serve as coach of the U.S. Olympic women's team. In a speech McKeever gave four years ago, she spoke about how long it took for women to break that barrier. "Swimming started at the Olympics for women in 1912," she said. "I had the great honor in 2012 to be the head coach as we went into in London. So 100 years."
That milestone didn't augur permanent change, though: four years later, McKeever was left off of the coaching roster. It was once again, all white men.
Susan Teeter, who recently retired as the head coach of the swim team at Princeton University, was disappointed by the snub. "I personally was pretty upset," she says. "I just don't understand how you can leave off someone who got rave reviews in 2012 as the head coach. It was mind boggling."
In past statements, the organization has pointed out that there are roughly the same number of female and male coaches in the sport. Women, however, are much more likely to coach younger age group swimmers.
Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a gold medalist in swimming in 1984 who now leads the advocacy organization Champion Women, says the lack of female coaches at the elite level has implications beyond depriving young girls of potential role models. "I think the consequences of having an overwhelming male coaching staff and leadership is a lot of sexual abuse," she says.
She says one of her former coaches, Mitch Ivey, abused a fellow teammate in the 1980s. In 1993, he separately denied allegations of sexual misconduct against him, according to The New York Times. He was banned by USA Swimming for violating its Code of Conduct decades later, in 2013.
"What made swimming so dangerous in my era and from what I understand today," says Hogshead-Makar, "is that there's this implicit understanding that coaches can find their romantic or sexual partner from within the athletes that they coach."
Those relationships have been prohibited since 2013. But as Hogshead-Makar points out, that only happened once the U.S. Olympic Committee pressured USA Swimming to adopt the rule.
Susan Teeter, the former coach at Princeton, says she is devoting her retirement to bringing more women into the coaching ranks.
"I don't have a solution, I just know it's a problem," she says. "And I'm willing to go out looking for the answers and trying to change it."
To that end, she says, she formed a task force to study the issue. Her hope is to ensure that the women who are on the pool deck aren't just swimmers or their moms, but the people actually in charge.
Nancy “Dutch” Ellen Olszewski died on May 17, 2018. She was 85.
She passed away in Santa Cruz County where she lived with her daughter Holly Heffner. She is precceeded in death by her son John Bradford Babb.
Nancy is survived by her brothers Michael Scahill, Barry Scahill and Bernard Scahill; children Dinah Guy, Holly Heffner, Mary (Robert) Braniecki and Deborah Frank; grandchildren Amy Huddleston, Mary Nickerson, Matthew Heffner, Melanie Scudder, Christopher Braniecki, Jake Stout, Lisa Brillhart, Holly Frank and Hailey Frank; great grandchildren William Akers, Hailey Heffner, Samuel Heffner, Tiziano Hererra, Tate Nickerson, Paige Nickerson, Clara Heffner, Lillianna Huddleston, Tristan Braniecki, Dana Brillhart, Owen Braniecki, Griffin Braniecki and Grace Brillhart.
Nancy was born in Sacketts Harbor, New York to Burton Joseph Scahill and Irene Major Scahill. She started her career as a model and eventually developed a passion for astrology and ESP. She started a New Age retail outlet that is now run by her daughter Dinah Guy. She retired to California almost 20 years ago and discovered an interest in Genealogy. She delivered binders of proof to every family tree she researched, including one that dated back to 1410. She also beat cancer four times.

NEW ORLEANS (AP)  When Tropical Storm Nate formed Thursday and forecasts put New Orleans in its projected path, one big question loomed for residents and business owners: Will the pumps work?
"That's now a thought in everybody who lives in New Orleans," said Devin Shearman, a manager at Katie's restaurant and lounge, which flooded during an unexpected rainstorm Aug. 5. It was one of two flash floods this past summer that led to revelations about personnel and equipment problems at the New Orleans Sewerage and Water Board, the agency that runs the pumping system that drains the city.
Some pumps weren't working. Some turbines that provide power to the pumps were down. There weren't enough people on hand to man the system.
"Since early August, we have made substantial progress," New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said of work to upgrade the city drainage system. But he warned at a Thursday news conference that extremely heavy rain and storm surge from Nate still could pose flood dangers.

Nate formed in the western Caribbean Sea and moved into Central America on Thursday. Forecasters said it would likely emerge in the Gulf of Mexico and strengthen, possibly reaching hurricane strength before a Sunday morning landfall somewhere along the Louisiana, Mississippi or Alabama coast. Officials in the resort town of Grand Isle on a vulnerable barrier island south of New Orleans called a voluntary evacuation Thursday. To the east, in coastal St. Bernard Parish, authorities ordered an evacuation of areas not protected by levees.
In the center of Nate's possible destinations was New Orleans, where the summer floods shook public confidence in the Sewerage and Water Board.
It's a state-created agency governed by a board that includes the mayor and appointees of the mayor and the City Council.
After the Aug. 5 revelations, the agency's executive director, Cedric Grant, resigned. Landrieu announced the appointment of a new six-member emergency team to run the agency, make immediate upgrades and recommend long-term changes.
The team is headed by veteran emergency expert Paul Rainwater.
"It's an antiquated system," Rainwater said Thursday, as he discussed his work and the decisions ahead on what will be needed in terms of equipment and personnel.
As of Thursday, city officials said, 108 of 120 pumps and 26 power generators were in place to back up working turbines. Also, the city said efforts to clean thousands of street catch basins had been stepped up, with vacuum trucks dispatched to various areas to suck out thick mud and debris.
Long-term, a major question facing the city is whether to stick with nearly century-old pumps, which cost a lot of money and manpower to maintain but last longer than newer pumps that are reported to have shorter lifespans.
Many are also questioning where the S&WB leadership needs to rest. One option is reducing its autonomy  making it a department directly under the mayor with scrutiny from the council. It's a suggestion New Orleans Inspector General Ed Quatrevaux has made to the mayor and City Council in letters for years.
Meanwhile, city officials must deal with the public's shaken faith in the drainage system.
The Sewerage and Water Board's emergency management team also included a new public relations director  a result of early, erroneous initial statements that the pumps were all working during the Aug. 5 floods.
"There was a lot of misinformation, or lies, frankly, about where we stood," City Council President Jason Williams said in a recent interview. "Moving forward, we've got to make sure that the Sewerage & Water Board is transparent to the public and to all branches of government, because clearly that wasn't happening, and that there's veracity, just being really honest."
Williams said in a recent interview that council members recently learned to pump capacity wasn't tested ahead of the hurricane season that began June 1.
"It's not a time to figure out things when you're underwater and when you're in a kayak," he said.
"I'm glad they're addressing it, finally, but I don't know if you can get my approval for addressing it now, after something's happened," said Shearman, who says patrons were stranded in the restaurant for hours in August when water in the streets was thigh-high. "Trust can be brought back. It's not going to come overnight though. It's going to take a lot of time."
ISLAMABAD, June 14 (APP): Election Commission of Pakistan
(ECP) on Wednesday received a first consignment of
100 biometric Verification Machines (BVMs) from a private firm
M/s Secure Tech Pvt. Ltd to use in election purposes.
According to an official of ECP, these machines have been
purchased to use in by-elections throughout
the country as pilot testing, a fist time ever in the election
process of the country. He said that a complete data of electoral
rolls will be feed in these biometric machines, which will
further ensure transparency in scrutinizing the voters' names.
He said that the commission was waiting for the response of
NADRA on ECP's request of providing thumb impression.
He said that the report on results of
scrutiny of pilot testing will be presented before
the Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reforms. The official
said that these machines which are more technically efficient
and reliable will meet the technical requirement of the commission.
This summer, Radiohead will be playing shows in the finer hockey arenas of North America's northeastern quadrant. But frontman Thom Yorke won't spend the entire year in band mode. Yorke's got plenty of solo endeavors going on; he is, for example, scoring director Luca Guadagnino's remake of the horror classic Suspiria, which is due to come out later this year. And Yorke has just announced that he'll play a couple of weeks' worth of solo shows in Europe just before that Radiohead tour starts up.
Yorke won't be touring with Atoms For Peace, the band he assembled, more or less, to play his solo stuff on tour. Instead, Yorke will be performing with his Radiohead producer and Atoms For Peace bandmate Nigel Godrich. Together, they'll be performing what a press release calls a “live mix,” doing tracks from the Yorke solo discography. Visual artist Tarik Barri will also be assisting them, and the minimal dance producer and cellist Oliver Coates, who worked with Radiohead on A Moon Shaped Pool, will open. Check out the dates below.

There were gasps and tears in the courtroom. Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis turned to the gallery and told families to "use your words," not violence.
"This is letting him have this power over us," she said. "We cannot behave like this."
During a return to court, Margraves told the judge that he just snapped. He said he had not known what exactly his daughters were going to say about their abuse.
"I look over here and Larry Nassar's shaking his head, no, like it didn't happen. ... I'm embarrassed," Margraves said of his conduct. "I'm not here to upstage my daughters. I'm here to help them heal."
About 30 more people spoke in person, by video or had statements read after the incident. The case will end Monday with final remarks from the prosecutor, defence and Nassar, followed by the judge's sentence. Nassar faces a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.
At a news conference, Margraves repeated his apology and insisted he's "no hero."
"My daughters are the heroes, and all the victims and the survivors of this terrible atrocity," he said.
Melissa Alexander Vigogne, who travelled from France to speak, said she was surprised that an attack had not been attempted earlier.
"It's not that that's how we should respond. But it's truly understandable — the amount of pain that we've all gone through," Vigogne said outside court.
Sheriff Tom Reich said his officers will investigate what happened in court and send a report to the local prosecutor.
The judge started the day by addressing comments made by a Nassar lawyer who said she had doubts about the large number of women and girls who say they were assaulted by Nassar. Cunningham called Shannon Smith's remarks "unfortunate" and said Nassar did not authorize them.
Smith told Detroit radio station WWJ that it is "really unfortunate" if some people stepped forward only because of all the recent attention. Nassar released a statement saying Smith's comments were a distraction and that his accusers' remarks "have pierced my soul."
Many of Nassar's accusers have blamed Michigan State, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for not doing earlier to stop him. The USOC announced Friday that it hired a law firm to conduct an independent investigation. And the co-ordinator of the women's national team for USA Gymnastics, Valeri Liukin, said he was stepping down.

Score One Free For The Kids December 7, 2017
New WAC program engages whole family
JOCELYN MURPHY
jmurphy@nwadg.com
Some parents may take their children to the theater every chance they get so they can bond over a shared love of the live art form (or just over the show tunes). And some parents may simply be looking for a family-friendly activity to get everyone out of the house during the winter break. In either case, the Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville offers a fun new program fit for the whole family with Kids Night on Broadway.
Technically speaking, the program isn't actually new; it's just new to the WAC. For 21 years, The Broadway League has hosted Kids Night on Broadway in New York, inviting children to get in free to a show with the purchase of a full price adult ticket. The program expanded across the country several years ago to venues like the WAC that present Broadway productions.
“With ‘Finding Neverland' being here, it being a matinee performance and kids being out of school, it was a great time for us to do it” for the first time, says WAC public relations director Jennifer Wilson. “This will be a great Christmas break activity. And it's not just going to the show — going to the show is the cool part — but we're also doing activities around it.
“The big thing is to introduce Broadway to that next generation of theatergoers — make it a really great experience for them so they appreciate it and come to love Broadway,” she adds.
Kids will get to make their own pirate hats, go on a treasure hunt at the theater and participate in a few more activities in the works to enhance their experience with “Finding Neverland.” The Kids Night program is one of several new engagement opportunities for guests to foster connections with the arts. The new Broadway Book Club pairs a relevant book with each Broadway show to be discussed in a group following the performance week (with the exception of “Finding Neverland,” for which the book club meeting will take place the Monday of opening week). And the Arts and Appetizers program offers discussions on context, backstage stories and historical perspectives surrounding a show, led by the WAC vice president of programs and special guests.
“I think we're so used to seeing performances in two-dimensions, on a screen — a lot of us just a screen on your phone, so it's not even a big screen — that to get to sit in a theater and see a real, live-action experience in front of you is hugely important,” Wilson says. And the addition of Kids Night to the WAC's already robust tradition of engagement will only further the goal of fostering community.
“It connects us to the arts, it connects us to creativity, it connects us to a shared experience with the other people around us,” Wilson says. “As a culture that becomes more and more isolated with our devices, getting into the theater and enjoying a live performance with an audience is something that's really important to introduce kids to so that they really see the value of that.”

Film: "Maze Runner: The Dead Cure";
Director: Wes Ball;
Cast:Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Kaya Scodelario, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosa Salazar, Aidan Gillen, Walton Goggins, Ki Hong Lee, Barry Pepper, Will Poulter, Patricia Clarkson;
"Maze Runner: The Death Cure" is the third edition of the series and is a breeze for those who are initiated into it.
For those who are new to the series, the screenplay written by T.S. Nowlin based on "The Maze Runner" novels by the American author James Dashner, is directed by Wes Ball. This edition picks up roughly six months after its 2015 predecessor, "Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials", left off.
Set in the distant future, in a dystopian state, the narrative begins with an excitingly staged, action-packed, multi-prong assault on a train that seems like a great train robbery. The perpetrators are the last of the Gladers. If you have to ask who they are, then you haven't seen the first two films.
They include Thomas (O'Brien) and his cohorts Frypan (Dexter Darden), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and their fellow resistance fighters Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar).
Their target is to rescue their friend Minho who is in the coach filled with children being sent to the Lost City, WCKD headquarters. Minho and the other children are being sent to a research facility where scientists will sacrifice them in the hope of using their blood to find a cure for "The Flare", a plague that turns people into zombies referred to as "Cranks".
This plague is ravaging what is left of humanity and as one of the characters said, "It's amazing what people can do when their survival is at stake."
The plot is entertaining without a doubt. There are plenty of big-budget action stunts, explosions and intense shootouts like you would expect. It ties up loose ends and finds a way to close out the series in a surprisingly emotional send-off.
That apart, there are plenty of misgivings sprinkled into the mix. First of all, the amount of deus-ex-machina in the film makes the entire process seem too predictable and boring at times. Secondly, the scenes are unnecessarily lengthy. And thirdly, the plot folds within itself many times, making the entire process a bit tedious.
A case in point is the initial goal to recuse Minho. As soon as they nearly achieve this, we are told Newt is infected and getting the serum for him becomes the priority, followed by Teresa's revelations.
And most of all, in the action sequences, except for a stray bullet that hits Thomas the large army of Stormtroopers are pretty ineffective in capturing the opponents, only speaks poorly of them or the director.
The film features many of the same characters from its predecessors. And the performers all seem to have effectively grown into their characters. Each one of them have their moments of on-screen glory and they all shine.
Overall, this film is a wrap up tale of the previous two editions and thus will appeal only to fans of the series. Others will find this film a slog.
Promises decision about running for Langley City mayor by early August
After serving one term as a Liberal MLA, former Langley City mayor Peter Fassbender is considering a return to municipal politics.
“I've had lots of people approach me,” Fassbender told Black Press.
“I haven't made a final decision. If I run, it will be for mayor.”
Fassbender said he would decide soon, likely by the end of this month or early next month.
“I would only do it if I believe I had something to contribute to the community (and) I would have to feel it's the best for me and my wife.”
Great Volunteer gathering at the Campaign Office!!! pic.twitter.com/5rXkuahX2J — Peter Fassbender (@Fassbender_BC) April 8, 2017
Fassbender was serving as mayor of Langley City when he was elected MLA for Surrey-Fleetwood in the 2013 provincial election.
He was appointed Minister of Education during a bitter labour dispute with the B.C. Teachers Federation that ended with a settlement after five days of round-the-clock talks.

He then served minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development and minister responsible for TransLink.
Fassbender stepped down from the mayor's job after winning his MLA seat in Surrey-Fleetwood.
So far, two incumbent Langley City councillors have declared for the mayoralty.

Rumors have been swirling around Spotify's big event in Manhattan for weeks on end now. But we've known since the invites went out that the big show is about one thing, and one thing alone: free.
The feature has long been rumored to be a thorn in the side of record labels and artists, everywhere. After all, there's no direct revenue generation — rather, the tier exists with the understanding that it's Spotify's best recruiting tool. Get roped in with the promise of music for nothing, and you'll eventually pony up the $10 a month for the convenience of premium. It certainly appears to have worked thus far, as the company currently boasts 70 million paid subscribers to its 90 million free users.
That number keeps the company well above Apple Music's 38 million. Of course, Apple's been growing rapidly, helped out by music exclusives and the service's deep integration the iTunes/iOS ecosystem. Apple's plans to acquire Shazam will no doubt help push that even further, as the company uses the popular music identification app to push new subscribers.
What Apple doesn't have going for it, however, is a free tier. It's no surprise then, that Spotify is milking that feature for all its worth, further blurring the lines between premium and free.
“You may ask why give this away for free?” Chief R&D Officer Gustav Söderström rhetorically asked the crowd at the Gramercy Theater this morning. “We know that it's the only way we're going to achieve our goal of getting billions of fans on the plan.”
That's as much an acknowledged that free is the main thing Spotify has going for it in this fight as any I've heard thus far. It seems likely that the company had to pull some teeth behind the scenes in order to convince labels that an even better version of its free offering would still benefit them in the end. Thankfully for Spotify, however, the feature has been grandfather in — it's been such an integral part of the Spotify experience since the beginning that it's impossible to divorce it from the service's overall value offering.
Of course, while the company appears confident that beefing up its free service won't cannibalize its free tier, labels will be watching the breakdown of free vs. premium with a very close eye. If growth stagnates for paid subscribers, Spotify will have a lot of angry royalty holders to contend with.

Jamoney Moore, 18, was arrested and charged with Attempted Murder after he admitted to shooting an 18-year-old victim.
According to Lovvorn, officers arrived on the scene and found the 18-year-old gunshot victim, who has since been transferred to a Birmingham hospital, and is now listed in stable condition.
Lovvorn's tweet stated that there was a shooting in the area of Perdue Place in Greenville. Officers responded to a shooting in progress around 7 p.m.
Investigators believe the conflict was between two groups that began arguing and eventually exchanged gunfire.
The investigation is still ongoing.

Filming is well under way in Ripon for a new BBC drama series starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint.
Park Street has been transformed into a TV set for a three-part adaptation of Agatha Christie's The ABC Murders, which is due to be aired around Christmas.
Picture: Carole Brice.
And Ripon Spa Baths will be closed on Friday as film crews turn the reception area into a train station waiting room.
A post on the Ripon Spa Baths Facebook page reads: "As you may have heard, The ABC Murders, starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint, will be filming in Ripon. Ripon Spa Baths is pleased to announce that they will be transforming our reception area to look like a train station waiting room and filming on site.
"We will be closed to the public on Friday 6th July to facilitate this, and then we can all look forward to seeing the result on screen later in the year!"
City resident Carole Brice spotted the cast and crew in and around Ripon on several occasions this week.
Picture: Carole Brice.
She said: "I am so excited that this is happening here in Ripon! I love Hercule Poirot and actually went to see David Suchet when he came to Harrogate.
"I collected all of the Agatha Christie paperbacks when I was younger. I can't wait to see how this filming slots into the show, we'll definitely recognise the swimming pool foyer as the train station. This has brought a lot of excitement, and it's another chance to put our quaint little city on the map. I love it when famous people come to town."
The last day of filming in Ripon is Friday, July 6.
John Malkovich will lead the cast as Hercule Poirot, alongside the likes of Rupert Grint, Andrew Buchan (Broadchurch), and Tara Fitzgerald (Game of Thrones).
Picture: Adrian Murray.
A letter to city residents from production company Mammoth Screen reads: "The production is set in the 1930s, so in order to facilitate the filming, we will need to control traffic on Park Street so the camera doesn't pick up 'modern life.'
"To this end, we have arranged with North Yorkshire Highways a traffic management scheme which will allow essential traffic access to the hospital, doctors surgeries, businesses and residents, and provide an option for non-essential traffic to divert around Park Street.
"Location filming cannot work without the ongoing support of local residents and businesses - we hope you will feel able to support the filming over this short period and apologise in advance for any disruption we may cause you. We are very much looking forward to filming in Ripon."
A synopsis for the series says: "The once celebrated detective Hercule Poirot has aged and his popularity has waned. But a series of murders by an anonymous killer known only as A.B.C brings him back into the public eye faced with the most chilling case of his career."
Ripon is no stranger to film and TV crews - hit ITV drama Victoria was filmed at Ripon Cathedral only last year.
SONIL DEDHIA
Last year, Aamir Khan and his filmmaker-wife Kiran Rao partnered with the state government for its flagship scheme, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan, aimed at making villages drought-free in five years through water conservation programmes. The star announced Satyamev Jayate Water Cup, a competition among villages to conserve water.
Ahead of the second edition of the Cup in 30 talukas of the state, Aamir and Kiran have decided to raise awareness with a music video with some help from the Sairat team. The lead actors of the Marathi blockbuster — Akash Thosar and Rinku Rajguru — will be part of the video directed by Nagraj Manjule while the music will be composed by Ajay-Atul. What's more, Kiran has lent her voice to the campaign song penned by Guru Thakur.
Confirming the development, Aamir's spokesperson says, “This is the first time she will be singing
and that too, in Marathi. It features Aamir and Sairat lead pair among many other celebrities. It is
a beautifully shot video by Nagraj, who has understood the essence and importance of the initiative.”
The names of the participating talukas will be announced at a press conference tomorrow at Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' Sahyadri State Guest House, adds the spokesperson. Along with the CM, Aamir and Kiran will be present at the event. Last year, as many as 116 villages took part in the competition, which created an annual water storage capacity of 1,368 crore litres in three talukas of the state. The actor received tremendous success with the test project. “The first edition of the
Water Cup was a pilot project and with its success, we now want to extend the watershed management programme to 30 more talukas in Maharashtra to make villages water-sufficient,” Aamir had said during the Water Cup awards function last October. The competition will take place from April 8 to May 22.
Top three villages across the state will get a cash prize of Rs 50 lakh, Rs 30 lakh and Rs 20 lakh respectively. In addition, the top village from each taluka will be awarded a cash prize of Rs 10 lakh.

Florida A&M expected to hire former Clemson quarterback Willie Simmons
TALLAHASSEE, Fl. (WOLO) – Florida A&M is set to hire a former Clemson quarterback.
Willie Simmons, who played at both Clemson and The Citadel, is set to take over the Rattlers program Monday. The hire was first reported by the Tallahassee Democrat.
Simmons stepped down at Prairie View A&M, and according to WTXL in Tallahassee, sources close to the program said the offer was placed in front of Simmons at the end of the season.
A press conference to announce Simmons as new head football is scheduled for Monday at Florida A&M.
Hot off the billion-dollar success of “Black Panther,” Michael B. Jordan is on board to produce the World War II action-drama “The Liberators” through his Outlier Society Productions and with Safehouse Pictures.
It's not yet been determined if Jordan will also star. The project is based on a spec script written by Madison Turner and tells the story of the 761st regiment in World War II, an entirely African-American combat unit whose heroism led to the desegregation of the armed forces.
Along with Jordan, producers are Safehouse Pictures' Tory Tunell and Joby Harold, and Outlier Society Production's Alana Mayo. Safehouse's Matt Schwartz will executive produce.
Warner Bros. finalized the deal for the script package late last week. Niija Kuykendall is overseeing for the studio.
Jordan's credits include “Black Panther” as the villain Eric Killmonger, the title character in “Creed” and “Fruitvale Station” — all three of which are directed by Ryan Coogler. Jordan's also starring in and exec producing HBO's upcoming “Fahrenheit 451” miniseries opposite Michael Shannon.
Harold is a writer on Warner Bros. upcoming “Flashpoint,” starring Ezra Miller in the standalone Flash movie for DC Entertainment. Harold also wrote the upcoming “Robin Hood” and “King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,” which he produced with Tunnell.
Turner previously wrote “6 Below: Miracle on the Mountain.”
Outlier Society Productions' other projects include the hourlong sci-fi family drama “Raising Dion,” which has a 10-episode straight-to-series order from Netflix; “The Thomas Crowne Affair” reboot, which Jordan will star in; an untitled project with Tarell Alvin McCraney for OWN; and an adaptation of the bestselling YA novel “The Stars Beneath Our Feet,” on which Jordan will make his directorial debut.
Jordan is repped by WME and attorney Greg Slewett. Turner is repped by CAA.

LONDON/BEIJING - China's Nanjing Hanrui Cobalt, which sells the metal to a firm approved by the London Metal Exchange, said it was unable to ascertain that its products did not involve the use of child labour in Africa.
Nanjing Hanrui is a supplier to another Chinese company, Yantai Cash, which is on the LME's list of firms whose cobalt meets its quality standards.
Concerns about the sourcing of Yantai's metal have reduced interest in the LME's cobalt contract, trading sources said, although there is no proof to date that children are involved in its extraction.
The issue is sensitive because cobalt chemicals are used in batteries to power the electric vehicles whose rapid growth is revolutionising the motor industry. Car companies are worried about possible scarcities of responsibly sourced cobalt.
Nanjing Hanrui said in a statement that it was examining its cobalt supply chain in the Democratic Republic of Congo, adding that initial findings showed “a part” of its cobalt came from “small-scale mining and artisanal mining areas”.
As this investigation started just over a month ago, the company still lacked experience in supply chain compliance management and it was “not yet possible to judge whether there is a risk of child labour,” the statement said.
Nanjing Hanrui said it was stepping up its supply chain studies with the help of experts.
Liu Xiaohan, manager of the international trade department at Yantai Cash, said in an emailed response that the firm bought part of its cobalt from Nanjing Hanrui, which is a business partner of Yantai Cash.
“We are currently unable to confirm what you discuss about Nanjing Hanrui's artisanal mining and the risk of it involving child labour,” Liu said.
This is because Yantai Cash has just started to set up a responsible management system and has not yet completed supply chain traceability, he added.
Yantai Cash's metal can be delivered against the LME's cobalt contract, which was launched in 2010.
The LME said action would be taken if any evidence was found of practices that fell below its standards.
Concerns arose in the market about the source of Yantai's metal in June after it started buying from Hanrui, sources said.
“The market is worried Yantai's cobalt is sullied by child labour, the LME should take it off the deliverable list,” a source on the exchange's cobalt committee said.
The source said customers did not want to take the risk of getting Yantai metal. “They are shunning the contract.”
TAINTED
Cobalt metal is used in alloys for jet engines, while cobalt chemicals are a key ingredient for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles.
Consumers worried about potential scandal are under pressure to ensure the cobalt they use is not tainted by child labour in DRC, the source of about 65 percent of the world's cobalt.
Concerns about shortages of cobalt from untainted sources have prompted carmakers to take steps to secure supplies for the longer term.
Volkswagen last month held talks with Glencore, China's Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, commodity trader Traxys, U.S. miner Freeport-McMoran and Eurasian Resources Group about securing cobalt supplies.
“Besides supplies and costs, other topics in discussion include future capacity expansion, sustainability and transparency,” a VW representative said.
A report last month from Amnesty International said about a fifth of cobalt production in the DRC is mined by hand, including by children, often in dangerous conditions.
“At least on a temporary basis, they have to ban Yantai Cash from the good delivery list,” a cobalt industry source said, adding that worries about Yantai metal had negatively impacted prices, volumes traded and open interest, a measure of the flow of money into the market.
LME cobalt at around $70,000 a tonne has recently traded well below benchmark prices gathered by Metal Bulletin, a trade publication.
The discount has widened since June 19, when worries about where Yantai's material was sourced from started to filter through the market. It has averaged $4,500 a tonne since June 19 from near $400 a tonne between Jan 2 and June 16.
Open interest crashed by more than 40 percent to 308 tonnes between June 19 and 22, while volumes traded on the LME in the third quarter at 1,949 tonnes are less than half the levels in the previous three quarters.
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING INITIATIVES
Yantai Cash said it is willing to work with companies in the cobalt supply chain “as well as other stakeholders to promote the alleviation of child labour and other human rights risks”.
It recently submitted an application to join China's Responsible Cobalt Initiative (RCI). A representative of the RCI secretariat said Yantai Cash's application would be accepted by Dec. 12 if there are no objections from the RCI board.
The RCI was formed last year under the umbrella of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers & Exporters (CCCMC). Its members agreed last month to establish the association as a legal entity with more than 20 members involved in the cobalt supply chain
The LME too has been looking at the subject of responsible sourcing and has been working with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which gets involved in setting such standards, for several years.
“There is no international standard in this area and the jurisdictional differences between certification regimes, audits and codes are extensive,” the LME spokesperson said.
Last month the exchange sent out a survey on responsible sourcing, auditing and certification of metal to all producers delivering metal against LME contracts.
“The LME's recent survey sent to all LME-listed producers was designed to elicit further information with regard to the sourcing of materials,” a statement said.
“We have been clear that any evidence of sub-standard practices that fall short of our requirements would be investigated by the LME and action would be taken,” it added.
The LME said it wanted to apply international standards on responsible sourcing. These would cover sustainable environmental management and occupational health, required for producers wanting to deliver against LME contracts.
Netflix has granted public screening access to Ava DuVernay's Oscar-nominated documentary “13th” for classrooms, community groups, book clubs, and other educational settings.
The streaming service said Tuesday that there has been a groundswell of interest from elementary school, universities, another other educational institutions asking for permission to screen the film. “13th” — which takes its title from the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolishing slavery — explores the link between slavery and the modern-day prison system.
“We have been overwhelmed and inspired by the response to '13th' from people of all ages,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of original documentary programming.
“Communities across the country are feeling the full weight of this particularly divisive moment in time,” Nishimura added. “And when some are capitalizing on this fear, we are especially inspired by the next generation, who are able to acknowledge the complex system they have inherited while simultaneously vowing to change it. Like DuVernay, they understand that we must come face to face with our past before we can fix our future.”
“13th” was the opening film at the New York Film Festival and was released Oct. 6 on Netflix. DuVernay begins the film by pointing out that 25% of those incarcerated in the world are imprisoned in the U.S. and contends that maintaining such a system amounts to perpetuating slavery.
Following the Netflix debut, advocacy organizations such as the ACLU, Center for Media Justice, cut50, and Google.org hosted dozens of community screenings across the country to support their organizing efforts — from Oakland, Des Moines, and Columbus, Ohio; to Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.
“13th” is competing for the best feature documentary Academy Award against “Fire at Sea,” “O.J.: Made in America,” “Life, Animated,” and “I Am Not Your Negro.”
Netflix original documentaries that are also part of the educational screening program include Oscar-nominated shorts “Extremis” and “The White Helmets,” as well as “The Ivory Game,” “Winter on Fire,” “Audrie & Daisy,” and “Into the Inferno.”

The playoffs are upon us, that is for the CHL and NCAA. The Edmonton Oilers might be far from the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs but several prospects are gearing up for the playoffs in their particular leagues. Tyler Benson has put himself back on track after numerous injuries caused setbacks in his development. In his final year of junior, Benson and the WHL's Vancouver Giants are looking to make some noise, and they've got the offense to do so.
Newly acquired J.D. Dudek and his Boston College squad, are looking like long shots. They need a few dominos to fall their way to have a chance at the playoffs. There are a lot of questions about the 22-year-old who was a sixth-round pick in 2014. Do the Oilers have a player with Dudek, or is he looking like another long-term college prospect?
Lastly, Kirill Maksimov signed his entry-level contract (ELC) with the Oilers last week. He will carry a $770,833 cap hit eventually, but will likely have his contract slide for the next year or two while he continues playing in junior. Maksimov is riding a hot streak with the Niagara Ice Dogs, and that team might be an underrated favorite to go on a deep run in the OHL Playoffs. Here are some thoughts on three future Oilers.
Can Tyler Benson Crack Oilers Lineup in 2018-19?
As much as Benson's been a revelation this season, it's early to suggest he could jump right into the Oilers lineup next season. Benson's wrapping up his last year of junior with the Vancouver Giants and has 27 goals and 69 points in 58 games. Only Kailer Yamamoto (1.60), and Kirill Maksimov (1.29) have better points-per-game (PPG) than Benson's 1.19.

It's fair to suggest that Yamamoto will be penciled into the Oilers top six next seasons. Benson will likely do a year or two in the AHL before truly vying for a spot on the Oilers. The current projection might be 2019-20. Until then expect him to take a leading role with the Bakersfield Condors next season where he'll get top line minutes on a team with sparse forward depth.
It wouldn't be outside of the realm of possibility that, similar to Ethan Bear this year, Benson gets a handful of NHL games next season to wet his appetite. To end the 2017-18 season, Benson's Vancouver Giants will take on the Victoria Royals in the first round of the WHL Playoffs. That'll be a good series with some star power. Ty Ronning (New York Rangers), and Matthew Phillips (Calgary Flames) are two other notable stars in that series.
Is J.D. Dudek Going to be a Player?
Dudek is still a bit of an unknown for most fans. When the Patrick Maroon deal came together, speculation would suggest the third-round pick was offered along with a prospect of Edmonton's choosing. Of the handful that was thrown on the table, Chiarelli took a stab at Dudek for a reason. He plays on the same team as Aapeli Rasanen and Graham McPhee. So it's easy to suggest Edmonton's scouts became quite familiar with Dudek and thought he could be a player.

There's concern over what his NHL ceiling might be considering he's in his third year at Boston College and his numbers aren't inspiring. In their third years in college, Drake Caggiula had 36 points in 42 games, and Joe Gambardella had 37 points in 40 games. ‬Even Patrick Russell had a point-per-game in 41 games in his second year of college. Dudek has 19 in 36 games. ‪
There's the potential of Dudek forgoing his final year of college eligibility and turning pro next season. The 22-year-old would likely get a good look with the Condors next season, but his numbers don't suggest he'd be a scoring threat in the NHL. The Oilers added a prospect who can skate, isn't too shabby in his two-way skills, and could be a depth player in a few years.
Kirill Maksimov Riding Hot Streak into OHL Playoffs
We talk a lot about steals or late round gems found in the NHL Draft. That's one of the reasons people are raving about Maksimov right now. It's no secret the Oilers have struggled to find or even develop prospects found later in the draft. It's a huge reason why this franchise hasn't been able to build any continued success, and why the rebuild has failed time and time again.

Maksimov looks like a bonafide goal scorer with top six potential. He's got an incredible shot, seems to find time and space quite well, and is a fairly good skater. He's versatile and can play all three forward positions. Looking at the power play down the road, Maksimov could be a triggerman for Edmonton. The 18-year-old has been an absolute stud for the Niagara Ice Dogs in the OHL.
He's scored 34 goals and 80 points in 62 games, and more than doubled his totals from last year. If he didn't get suspended he would've been on pace to lead Niagara in scoring this season. The Ice Dogs will play the Oshawa Generals in the first round of the OHL Playoffs. In a limited sample size, Maksimov's proven to be a playoff performer with seven points in eight games. He's also riding a six-game point streak where he's scored two goals and 14 points.

Aston Villa owner Dr Tony Xia has admitted that the club face 'severe challenges' from Financial Fair Play next season.
Steve Bruce's side were resigned to their third season of Championship football following their 1-0 play-off defeat to Fulham.
Villa are now expected to cut costs this summer as the club tries to stay within Financial Fair Play restrictions.
Playmaker Jack Grealish has been linked with a move away while the Villa Park club could be set to sell former Bristol City stars Albert Adomah and Jonathan Kodjia.
Writing in a club statement, Xia explained: "We are all aware that we will face severe FFP challenges next season. I am an Aston Villa fan. But I am also a businessman.
"Under the current circumstances, I think the club needs to rethink not only the past two years but also the past ten years. Villa needs to be a sustainable football club. People join. People leave. That is the cycle of football. But the football club always remains through it all.

"This is the ultimate reality that cannot be changed, but I can assure you that everyone behind the scenes is working tirelessly towards achieving our ultimate goal."
"We have been heavily investing for the past two seasons. However, the loss on Saturday means that we need to change a lot of things.
"No one wanted to see the club have to go through this, but I believe that only changes can help the club to progress towards the positive direction and this requires the joint efforts of everyone associated with this great football club.
"No matter what the changes will be, I sincerely hope that everyone can unite and overcome the challenges together.
"Our goal has not changed and as long as we believe, regardless of how tough the process will be, I am sure we will succeed in the end."
Kieran Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, discussed Villa's problems in an interview with the BBC earlier this week.
He said: “It's really severe for Villa because this is the second year they've had parachute payments. They got around £35million from the Premier League to cushion the blow of relegation.
“Those payments get cut back severely next year so they're going to have £20million less coming in. I think the problem for Villa is that the owner has gambled in the last couple of years on recruiting players on big wages."
Villa has a large wage bill and Maguire says that this will make it a very tough summer for the club.
“The average wage at Villa is nearly £30,000 a week and it's simply not sustainable in the Championship.
“It's going to be a very big summer. They're going to have to sell the crown jewels, I suspect. The problem that they're going to have is that other clubs know they're in a financial pickle and they'll be trying to get them on the cheap.
“If you take a look at their first season in the Championship, they were losing around £800,000 a week, and that was on parachute payments of around £40million.
“Next season it's down to around about £15million so there's got to be severe cutbacks. I'd be very surprised if John Terry stays because he would have been on a decent wage."

Islamabad - Chief Commissioner of Islamabad Aftab Akbar Durrani on Tuesday directed the concerned departments in a joint meeting to expedite the anti encroachment campaign in the federal capital to clear all encroached areas.
The joint meeting also reviewed the implementation status of the ongoing campaign regarding the removal of encroachments from the city, a press release said.
Durrani while chairing a high level meeting of Islamabad Capital Territory Administration (ICTA), Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Islamabad Capital Territory Police stressed for the effective coordination among all the team members taking part in the operation against encroachments.
The commissioner directed the teams' members to conduct a preparation session one day before the operation and devise strategy, planning and coordination to carry out the anti encroachment drive.
The participants were informed that anti encroachment campaign has been carried out thrice a week and has been divided into three categories. It was decided in the meeting that team members would give 48 hours written notice to the buildings that fall in Category A before the removal of those encroachments and they should have police and magisterial cover at least a day prior to the operation. It was also decided that in case the CDA teams require police assistance in any area regarding encroachments which fall in the category B and C, they could contact Additional Deputy Commissioner Shoaib Ali for provision of police assistance and magisterial cover that would be provided at once. The commissioner also set a time frame of three days for the enforcement staff of CDA to complete a survey of illegal kiosks in ICT.
The meeting was also attended by the CDA Chairman Usman Akhtar Bajwa, Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Captain (R) Mushtaq Ahmed, Director Admin, and Muhammad Ali, Senior Superintendent of Police Najeeb- Ur -Rehman Bagvi, Director Finance Syed Najaf Iqbal and Additional Deputy Commissioner Shoaib Ali.
LAHORE, Aug 13 (APP): Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shehbaz
Sharif Sunday said more than two lakh students were being equipped
with education through the Punjab Educational Endowment Fund (PEEF).
Scholarships worth Rs 12 billion out of the income of this
fund had been distributed so far on merit basis, he added.
The chief minister said had this educational fund been established
70 years ago, instead of two lakh students, there would have been more
than two crore brilliant students fulfilling their educational thirst today.
Talking to elected representatives, Shehbaz Sharif said high
education was not merely legacy of elite but it was the right of every child of Pakistan.
He added doors of higher education had been
opened for talented students of poor families through the PEEF
and not only Punjab but industrious students of
underprivileged families from all over the country, including
Sindh, Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and
AJK, were benefitting.
The chief minister said one of the goals of
establishing Pakistan was also providing equal educational
opportunities and this fund was playing an imperative role in
the fulfillment of this important objective of creation of
Pakistan.
He said the Punjab government had laid the foundation of
nation's brightest future by establishing the PEEF and this fund
was a successful story of hardwork, trust and upright. Shehbaz
Sharif added that this fund had opened doors of standard
education on the poor children of the nation and was producing
young doctors, engineers, bankers and teachers who were playing
their active role in the development of the country.
The chief minister said the PEEF was not only Pakistan's
largest educational fund but also there was no such fund in
South Asia and the Punjab government had provided resourceless
children with their right through this fund. He added
that merit was rule of law in Punjab and like other programs,
it had been kept as criteria and scholarships were being
distributed purely on merit basis.
Marc Staal has spent his entire 12-year NHL career with the New York Rangers. One way or another that tenure with will have to end soon. Staal has three years remaining on a contract that pays him $5.7 million per season. The team is essentially paying Staal to be the lesser part of a top defensive pair.
While the 31-year-old defender had a bit of a resurgence this season, his game is no longer suited for a key role in the modern NHL style of uptempo play. There are still players of his ilk and ability operating in depth roles, getting matched up appropriately and being used to kill penalties. However, paying them among the top salaries at the position (Staal's salary ranks 23rd among league defenders) is a mismanagement of the salary cap and hinders a team's ability to be competitive.
How to Shed Staal's Contract
There are a few ways to shed a bad contract. Staal has a No Movement Clause (NMC) in his that requires his consent for a trade or demotion to the team's AHL affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. That complicates matters for the Rangers if they wanted to trade him.
Given his age and the remaining years on his current deal, it is unlikely that a contender would be interested. Even if the Rangers retained 50% of his remaining contract, he would still come with a three-year deal and a $2.85 million price tag. That is still a big investment for a player like Staal.
Another method would be to trade him to a less competitive team that might benefit from Staal's experience. The Arizona Coyotes would be a prime example of this. The issue here is the NMC. There is little incentive for a veteran player who has control over his destination to go to a team that won't provide him with an opportunity to compete for a championship. Staal would have to uproot his family to land in the same situation as he is in New York.
The final option for the Rangers would be to exercise their buyout option as they did with Dan Girardi. If they buy out Staal's contract this summer, the team would have six more years with a reduced cap hit before his contract was off the books. The numbers per year, starting with the upcoming 2018-19 season, would be around $2 million, $3 million and $3.8 million followed by three seasons at $1.4 million. That is a significant amount of cap space to throw away, but if the team is truly rebuilding, the cap space they have available for the next couple of seasons might not matter so much.
The 2020-21 year at $3.8 million could prove the most problematic if the team is ready to compete again by then. However, it would still be less than the $5.7 million he would be owed in the final season of his contract. After that, the $1.4 million over three years is manageable for a contending team.
Alternatively, the Rangers could keep Staal this coming season and buyout his deal at season's end. That would leave him on the books for four more years at a reduced rate of first $2.9 million and then $3.7 million followed by two additional years at $1.2 million.
Staal's Value During the Rebuild
A buyout either this year or next is the most likely method of removing Staal from the team. But is that a good idea?An argument against moving Staal, given his contract and ability, is that the Rangers are rebuilding and have plenty of salary cap space available right now. Rebuilding teams need veteran experience to help show incoming young players the ropes. By all accounts, in theory, Staal would provide exactly that type of leadership.
Staal has never been a distraction in the locker room and has worn the assistant captain's “A” for years. There is a case to be made that, barring an unforeseen about-face in organizational strategy, the team won't be using their considerable salary cap space this season to lure in high-priced free agent talent or acquiring big-ticket contracts via trade. Riding out the remaining years on Staal's contract is a viable option.
As mentioned above, the Rangers could keep him this season and readdress the situation next off-season. In that scenario, the buyout numbers would be slightly better over the following four seasons and also expire a year earlier than a buyout of all three of Staal's remaining years.
Why the Rangers Should Move on From Staal Now
While kicking the can down the road might seem more viable to long-term salary cap management, there are other issues with keeping Staal around. The most pressing is that while he does provide a veteran presence, his game is unsuited for the direction new head coach David Quinn has set for the team. Staal is not fleet of foot nor does he possess the creativity to aid the team offensively in transition. He doesn't regularly play with the snarl that Quinn has promoted.
His typical play in the offensive zone is to rush the puck up the ice, carry it deep and either lose it or put an ineffective shot on goal. When he finds an opportunity to use his shot from the point, he rarely gets the puck on net. While there are a few memorable moments when he scored big goals in the playoffs, Staal's regular season, across 761 career games, shows just 38 goals. Over the same span, he's contributed 126 assists and has not exceeded 20 points in a season since 2010-11.
He is unfit for the style of play that the Rangers should be transitioning towards and a locker room presence can be added for significantly less even with the cost of a buyout. Staal would also take away a roster spot from a younger player who is a better fit for the club or for a veteran defender whose game lends itself to the style the Rangers coach wants to play. Staal's best fit for the Rangers would be as a depth defender who doesn't regularly play except as an injury fill in.
That would be a poor way to treat a player like Staal who has given so much to the franchise. A buyout could benefit Staal in the same way it did Dan Girardi. He would be given the opportunity to sign a cheap deal with a contending team that could use him in a reduced role and would give him the chance to compete for a Cup again as his career winds down. Perhaps he could join the growing list of ex-Rangers down in Tampa where the cap-strapped Lightning could benefit from a low-cost depth veteran on their blue line.
Time for the Rangers to Let Staal Go
Staal has been a part of the Rangers through multiple Stanely Cup playoff runs, including a trip to the Final in 2014. While it is always difficult for a team to move on from a player who has spent his entire career with the club, for the sake of their rebuild it is time to rip the band-aid off. The team can handle the cap charge over the next three seasons and even if they become competitive again three years from now, his buyout cost would still be a reduction over his full salary.
Removing Staal would solidify the Rangers' change of system and culture as they move forward with their rebuild and begin looking towards a competitive future.

PRESS RELEASE – FORMER Australian Prime Minister Julia Eileen Gillard got it right when she said, “Our future growth relies on competitiveness and innovation, skills and productivity […] and these in turn rely on the education of our people.”
The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council (NCPC), the local body tasked with ensuring that the optimum conditions exist to facilitate an environment of maximum productivity and competitiveness and continued economic growth, remains committed to partnering with organizations which not only understand the importance of but are also invested in the Council's mandate.
In elaborating the Work Programme for 2017-2018, the Council identified capacity building as a critical component to improving employee productivity and ultimately the quality of service and the output in both the public and private sectors. Similarly, it was agreed that investing in the training and development of employees would be key in achieving the mindset change necessary to advance the productivity and competitiveness agenda locally and ultimately encourage sustainable economic growth.
Consequently, when the NCPC Technical Secretariat was approached by the team from Celestial Self Development Centre, the Eastern Caribbean Franchisee for Franklin Covey, to partner to offer the critically acclaimed “5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity” Workshop in Saint Lucia, the decision was simple.
The “5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity”, one of the many solutions offered by Franklin Covey, is aimed at empowering individuals by allowing them to “be more selective, and make high-impact choices about how and where they choose to invest their time, attention and energy.”
The one-day workshop was held at Bay Gardens Hotel in Rodney Bay on November 29 and attended by nine participants from the public and private sectors, of which three were from the Department of Finance.
In opening the session, Programme Facilitator and Trainer, Thecla Deterville, said that the focus during the 5 Choices training would not be on getting things done but rather getting the right things done.
“It is so easy to get inundated with activities which have little or no return. The 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity is about finding the delicate balance between the important and unimportant activities. Today, we are going to learn how to make the right choices for maximum results in all aspects of our lives,” she said.
Throughout the day, participants had an opportunity to define what extraordinary productivity meant to them from both a professional and personal standpoint, while engaging in lively discussions and exercises and sharing experiences and best practices.
The day ended with each participant sharing on what their key take-away was from the activity.
Donna Louis, Human Resource Officer in the Department of Finance, indicated that the workshop had left her with a renewed appreciation for the importance of living above the noise.
She said, “Choice 3: Schedule the Big Rocks, Don't Sort the Gravel is very important in my role as HRO. I am looking forward to applying the concepts learnt here today to identify the tasks which are not only important but yield the maximum output. Training like this 5 Choices Programme makes all the difference in helping to change mindsets and dispel the notion that being busy is equivalent to being productive. I look forward to immediately applying what I learnt here today and helping to change the way things are done in not only my department but within the service,” Louis explained.
Since 2016, Celestial Self Development Centre has hosted the 5 Choices to Extraordinary Productivity in Saint Lucia. This recent collaboration with the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council is testimony to the organization's commitment to addressing the state of productivity in Saint Lucia.

Mercedes-Maybach on Tuesday revealed its concept for the 2018 Beijing auto show, and as we learned via a leak last week the concept blends elements of a sedan with an SUV.
You're probably thinking the premise was a donk for the ultra-rich, but Maybach says its concept, whose full title is Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury, sets out to combine the comfort and elegance of a high-end sedan with the tall ride height and command seating position of an SUV.
As the head of design for all Daimler brands Gorden Wagener explains, the concept “combines the DNA of an SUV with that of a sedan to produce an ultramodern SUV of three-box design."
We're sure it's not to everyone's taste but there could be a niche for such a body style in parts of sedan-loving China where poor roads demand some decent ground clearance. The idea certainly isn't new. Dutch sports car marque Spyker rolled out an eerily similar concept as far back as 2006, and Volvo has actually put a sedan on stilts into production in the form of the S60 Cross Country.
Chinese market demands have also influenced the interior, which is lined in leather and accented with polished metal and blue ambient lighting. There's also "Magic Wood" ebony, which is traditional in Chinese furniture design, and just four seats, with the center console stretching the length of the cabin. This unit skips the traditional champagne cooler and flutes in favor of a Chinese tea set. Maybach has developed a matching furniture collection that reflects the design idiom, form and material mix of the concept, in case you were keen on a similar aesthetic for your home or office.
As the Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury is intended primarily for chauffeur-driven use, the cockpit has been reduced to the essentials. A pair of 12.3-inch screens provide all the relevant information and are flanked by air vents that feature the same pinstripe suit-inspired vertical strips found on the front grille.

Power in the concept comes from four electric motors that deliver a combined 750 horsepower and form an all-wheel-drive system. A lithium-ion battery in the floor holds 80-kilowatt-hours of charge and should carry the vehicle about 200 miles. The concept also features DC charging based on the CCS standard, allowing for up to 350-kilowatt charging capability. This is enough to add 60 miles of range in as little as 5 minutes.
While Maybach is unlikely to put the concept into production, we should see some of its design elements and technology in production in the not too distant future. In fact the general proportions from the front to about the midway point matches up with the next Mercedes GLS, which is due on sale next year and is expected to spawn a Maybach variant.
The Beijing auto show opens its doors on Wednesday. It's where Mercedes will also unveil its first-ever A-Class sedan. To learn about some of the other vehicles set to appear, head to our dedicated hub.
CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa captain Faf du Plessis has been ruled out of the remainder of the one-day and Twenty20 series against India due to a fractured finger.
The injury could also sideline the 33-year-old from the first two tests against Australia next month.
It is another injury blow for the Proteas, who have already lost AB de Villiers due to a finger injury for the first three matches of the 50-over series against India.

Du Plessis fractured his right index finger in the six wicket loss to India in the opening ODI in Durban on Thursday, a match in which he scored 120 runs to anchor the home innings.
He will be out of action for between three and six weeks, Cricket South Africa said in a statement on Friday, leaving him in a race against time to be fit for the first of four tests against Australia that start on March 1.
Farhaan Behardien has been called into the limited overs squad as a replacement, while the Proteas have also added uncapped Heinrich Klaasen as a reserve wicketkeeper-batsman.
There are five more ODIs in the series against India followed by three Twenty20 internationals.
5G is nearly here. The next generation of wireless connectivity promises superfast speeds, ultra-low latency and more network capacity than ever. 5G auctions have or are due to take place in the US, UK, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Germany, Australia and host of other countries.
The Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was billed as a major 5G-powered event. Companies such as Nokia, Ericsson, and Intel are all promoting their 5G credentials, with Huawei pushing the issue particularly hard saying it will be selling 5G ready infrastructure in the coming months.
But is this actually the case?
“I believe 5G is really, really over-hyped considering that there's only a few known use-cases that people really know that we need it,” says Magnus Jern, Chief Innovation Officer at mobility consultancy firm DMI.
“Of course, we do need 5G; there'll continue to be a huge demand for increased capacity, lower latency etc, but we just need to be realistic about the timeline. There will probably be a lot of use cases that can really leverage 5G, but are probably going to take five to 10 years, rather than next year as some of the operators are promising.”

Looking back on Zurich, I think it was an incredible success. It was the most well-organised race we have held, but it was also one of the most challenging to coordinate.
Our previous record for the number of walls we had to install on the last night came in Paris, where it was over 250. But in Zurich, we had 389 walls to go in at the last minute. The logistics that were in place were complicated, but they worked very well. This was all down to Swiss precision – the team was incredibly well-organised with very good planning. It was the pinnacle of street racing construction and it's never been done so well before.
There were also some absolutely spectacular hospitality structures, which we've never had at any other track. The ABB E-Cube was over the start/finish straight and the Julius Baer Pole Position Lounge was above the garages.
This was the first time that a race took place on the streets of Zurich. The historic significance was also very important after decades of not racing in Switzerland, and finally having that first race – I think that's why a huge crowd showed up, and why it was so spectacular.
The location itself was fantastic. It's exactly the thing we want to do in Formula E – take the race to the people and make it part of the city. People sunbathing on the shores of Lake Zurich were not there because of the race; they were there enjoying their weekend while the race was going on too. The Formula E race was part of the city life.
We had great feedback from the mayor and the local organisers, and I would be very surprised if we didn't go back to Zurich. It left a fantastic impression – the mayor loved it, as did the partners, who were a huge part of why the event happened in the first place. The sponsors were really pushing for the event to happen and were over the moon with the results. We're even looking at taking the big wooden pit structure to our other races, as it belongs to the Zurich promoter. It's pretty big, so we're talking to the promoter to see where there is space for it on the other tracks.
Now we're heading to New York City for the season finale, which will be the last race with the current generation of cars. It's the end of an era – an era that will probably never exist again in motorsport, a time when drivers raced with two cars. Formula 1 had a few races with two cars back in the 1950s – when one car broke down and a driver was allowed to drive their teammate's car. That was the beginning of an era, but we've had four years of full, two-car racing, so it is pretty significant that we're coming to the end of this period and then start a new one in Saudi Arabia.
That will be a very interesting moment in the life of Formula E – a huge moment with the new car – the beginning of a new chapter. It's also about all that comes with the change –the development of the technology. We are succeeding in moving forward with the energy density of the batteries and we're actually achieving many of our targets. On the back of that, everyone is following the series' progress over the years, so the car is a symbol of the new era.
There are always risks when championships go to a new car. People like what we have now: the pitstops, the change of cars, and so on. But there's also a risk in staying where you are and not moving forward – and I think there is more risk in staying where we are than making this leap. There are always risks, but we quite like that – if there is no risk, there is no motivation!
WILMINGTON — Clinton County was recently recognized as one of the “Top 100 Micropolitans” in the U.S., according to a ranking by Site Selection magazine.
This trade publication annually ranks states and regions on their success in securing projects that result in new investment and job creation opportunities.
In 2017, as it did the previous two years, Ohio produced more Top 100 micropolitans than any other state — 16 — while Georgia came in second with 14. The Wilmington — Clinton County micropolitan tied for 64th on the list.
Annually, Site Selection magazine offers the opportunity for states to submit projects, announced or initiated, for consideration for the Governor's Cup – awarded to the state(s) with the greatest number of qualifying projects and total projects, per capita for the previous year (2017).
Projects needed to meet at least one of the following criteria: 20 or more jobs created; 20,000 square feet or more of new or expanded space be constructed; or capital investment of $1 million or more for construction, land or building. According to Site Selection's Conway Projects Database, it focuses on new corporate facility projects with significant impact, including headquarters, manufacturing plants, R & D Operations and logistics sites.
Clinton County submitted four projects, with a combined impact of $70 million in new investment, 150 new job opportunities to be created, and 400 jobs retained. The project submissions are “vetted” by JobsOhio, the state's economic development agency, and again by Site Selection's staff.
County-wide projects were submitted by the Clinton County Port Authority (CCPA).
“We're pleased to see our community receive national recognition as an exceptional location for business expansion,” said Dan Evers, CCPA Executive Director. “The projects, and the effort to provide relevant project data for this review, are a reflection of our local units of governments and local economic development network working together to facilitate growth and investment.
“We appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with the Dayton Development Coalition and JobsOhio in submitting these projects, and in the work done to secure these opportunities. It speaks volumes about our community, region, and state's collective effort to facilitate economic development opportunities.”
Statistically, a micropolitan is area with an urban cluster with at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 in population, according to the Census bureau. It recognizes 550 micropolitan statistical areas in the United States.
The Bright Farms facility is under construction on Davids Drive.

Under the income-tax law, income tax is payable on any sum of money, movable property or immovable property received by an individual without consideration (that is, without a quid pro quo), except gifts received from specified relatives or on specified occasions such as marriage and inheritance.
Therefore, a gift of money to your daughter (who is your lineal descendant) will not be subject to tax in your hands or in the hands of your daughter in India.
From April 2017 to September 2017, I was working in India. I have come to Germany on deputation for 6 months. I will be working here from 1 October 2017 to 31 March 2018. What will be the income tax implication on earnings for the complete year (from April 2017 to March 2018)?
—Mahesh Ganti
Taxability in India depends on the following factors:
(a) Source of income
(b) Residential status as per income tax law
Typically, source of income lies where the services are performed, or where the asset, from which the income arises, is located. Any income, the source of which is located in India, is taxable in India (irrespective of residential status).
Residential status under the income-tax law is determined based on your physical presence in India in the current financial year (FY) (1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018) and preceding 10 FYs.
Depending on the number of days of presence in India, there can be following types of residential status in India:
(a) Resident and ordinarily resident
(b) Resident but not ordinarily resident
(c) Non-resident
On the basis of above facts, you will most likely qualify as a resident in India if you have spent 182 days or more in India during the FY 2017-18.
As resident, you will be taxable in India on the below mentioned during the FY 2017-18:
(a) Salary income earned in India during the period April 2017 to September 2017;
(b) Salary income earned in Germany during the period October 2017 to March 2018;
(c) Any other personal income earned or received in or outside India.
To avoid double taxation of salary income, you may consider the following:
(a) Claim foreign tax credit for taxes paid in Germany against India income-tax payable on doubly taxed salary income as per Article 23 of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Germany;
(b) Maintain proof of taxes paid in Germany (return, challan or any other documentary evidence);
(c) Prepare and file Form 67 along with India income-tax return (‘return').
Form 67 is a new requirement effective FY 2016-17. Under the Income-tax Rules, 1962, foreign tax credit claimed in the return will be allowed only upon furnishing Form 67 by the individual. This is in addition to the return to be filed by the individual.

If ‘Yer Favorite Powder Is Missin' Try TITE-WAD Instead …
Variety is the spice of life and there's always more than one way to skin a skunk without getting sprayed. Just as there are many ways to get a bullet to do what we want it to, but with different powders.
With panic in the air, and hoarding being the norm in our industry, it seems, many times our favorite powders just aren't on the shelves. Here is where we need to get innovative, without blowing ourselves and our guns up, when it's time to feed our favorite guns. Don't be a big chicken! The sky is not falling, if your pet powder is missing from the shelves of your favorite gun shop! There are alternatives!
For the casual, or beginner handloader, you can't beat good reference materials such as handloading books. Get all the books you can, from different sources. Handloading books suggest different powders with the loads shown, with the company's bullets, for that particular caliber. They are full of load data. You know you are hooked on handloading when you can study these cook books with enthusiasm, as you compare powders, measurements and bullet weights to get an idea of what is right. You can never go wrong by having too many handloading books. I dare say there is no such thing as too many.
Many powders are duplicated, that is, they may have different labels, but they are poured from the same spout at the factory. H110 and Winchester 296, and HP-38 and Winchester 231 are cases in point. For me, price dictates which I will buy when at my local “fix” shop.
Fancier Thinking
For the more experienced handloaders, a smokeless powder burn-rate chart is our best friend, and guide, to making sensible alternative choices. Burn rate charts always start with the fastest burning powders and progress to slower burning powders. These are usually posted in your handloading book, or can easily be obtained via the Internet. Sometimes making different choices allows us to stumble upon a better load than our original one. The basic rule is to find the powder you normally use and then look for powders on either side of it. Say your powder is number 43 in the burn rate chart. If you go faster, i.e. 42, 41, or 40, you will use less powder than your standard one. Start low and work up slowly is the cardinal rule to trying new load data. Re-check your reloading manuals for a possible reference point.
When going the other way, 44, 45, 46, etc., you can start with your usual powder charge of your original powder, and work up slowly. The aid of a chronograph is invaluable during the process. Using a three-pronged approach, with accuracy being the most important, with speed and pressure being the guidelines, it's actually very interesting to do your own load development. Know the pressure signs for each of your guns. Starting low and slow as you progress is key. Many powders from different companies have almost duplicate burn rates. Don't get pigeon-holed to just one powder company. Try ‘em all out.
Lately I've been using faster powders and lighter home-cast slugs just in the name of conservation. With prices going up, and availability sketchy at best, I like mean, lean, efficient handloads when punching paper. With 7,000 grains of powdered propellant per pound of smokeless powder, I want as many loads as possible for my practice loads. When I can get twice as many loads, or more, from a pound of powder, at approximately the same speed from a faster powder, it only makes sense, and makes me and my wallet happy! So what if the loads are a bit slower? The paper target doesn't know the difference.
A New Powder?
I'm waiting for the powder companies to come out with TIGHT-WAD powder, named after guys like me, who want 6-7,000 loads per pound of powder, to do our shooting at reasonable velocities, for any caliber we shoot.
Those white-coat lab guys are always coming up with new recipes for good ol' smokeless, but when availability is the issue, sometimes the old standbys are often overlooked. Bullseye, Unique and 2400 come to mind. As I get older and am prone to being a sentimental sap, I relish using these condiments the greats of our addiction used. Legends like Elmer, Skeeter, Phil Sharpe and the Bobs, of Hagel and Milek persuasion. If you haven't, look up these fellas and read what they wrote. You'll be glad you did, as you walk in their footsteps and experience their findings first-hand after reading about their innovative experiments. Then enjoy duplicating their loads for yourself.
Who said history wasn't historical and stuff? It's always good to know your roots and background whenever beginning a forward journey. No truer words can be said as you lay your foundation to experimenting with alternative powders. So don't be a big chicken! Try something new! If your favorite powder is missing from the shelf, the sky is not falling! Rather, a opportunity is being made to try something new!

The new year is looking bright for many of Hawaii's public school students thanks to the efforts of ukulele virtuoso Jake Shimabukuro.
He's completed a project he started last August to repair 100 damaged Kamaka ukuleles in Hawaii's public schools.
Shimabukuro stepped in, often times repairing them while he was on touring around the world.
He says he wasn't sure if he would be able to complete the project by the end of the year, but with some hard work and a little bit of help, it paid off.
“But if you had asked me two months ago I would have said no way we're going to finish this but the last week I had a lot of help,” Shimabukuro told KHON2. “For me, I went to Ala Wai Elementary School where we got a ton of ukulele from Ala Wai and those were the Kamaka that I learned on.”
The refurbished ukulele will be given back to the schools within the next few weeks.
Shimabukuro says he'll continue working on repairing as many ukuleles as he can.
TUSTIN, Calif. (AP)  Robert L. McKay, who designed the first Taco Bell restaurant and with founder Glenn Bell turned it from a quirky food stand into a fast-food empire, has died. He was 86.
His son, Rob McKay, says McKay died last week from cancer.
Bell opened his first Taco Bell in Downey, California in 1962, selling hard-shell tacos and other Mexican-inspired fast food.
McKay was an architect and designed the Spanish-style arched and tiled building that became the chain's signature look.

McKay eventually became president of Taco Bell, which had some 900 restaurants when it was sold to PepsiCo in 1978.
He went on to finance other businesses that invested in technology, consumer products, real estate and banking.
Many people may have noticed a spike in their gas bills in January, but Jenny Gobble with Spire says that's to be expected. (Source: Spire)
Many people may have noticed a spike in their gas bills in January, but Jenny Gobble with Spire, formerly Alagasco, says that's to be expected.
Gobble said the increase has to do with usage. The past two winters have been fairly mild in Alabama, but this winter has seen two snowstorms and colder temperatures. Customers are therefore using more energy, causing their bills to increase, Gobble said.
Spire acquired Alagasco in September 2014. In December 2017 they asked for a “very modest” two percent of the overall bill increase.
Gobble also said that starting Thursday, lower rates from Spire will go into effect, citing the recent tax cuts passed by Congress and signed by the president. Since Spire is facing a lower tax burden, she said the company is passing lower costs on to their customers. That translates to about a 2.9 percent cut in customers' overall annual bill.
When asked for comment on the higher bills, the Alabama Public Service Commission released this statement:
"The Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC) is certainly aware that the coldest winter experienced in this state in many years has resulted in natural gas bills that are above the levels normally experienced during our typical winters in Alabama. The increased gas bills customers are experiencing is primarily attributable to colder weather with the resulting higher level of gas usage. For January 2018, average residential gas usage in Alabama is 54.3% higher than January 2017. There is no correlation between Spire Alabama's acquisition of Alagasco and higher average gas bills this winter. Spire acquired Alagasco more than three years ago. On October 1, 2017 the utility changed its name from Alagasco to Spire but ownership and management has remained unchanged since 2014. Spire Alabama, Inc. did file for a rate increase in December 2017 that was reduced by 38% due to the efforts of the Commission and its staff. Further, the increase that ultimately went into effect on December 1, 2017 will be offset by a revised filing submitted by Spire to be effective today which will decrease base rates by approximately $12.8 million over the remainder of 2018. The rate decrease is attributable to the federal corporate income tax reduction approved under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Recovery Act of 2017. Anyone with questions about their Spire bill should call 800-292-4008."

Toronto FC is a very good team. Top of the East, leading the Supporters; Shield race, and with seemingly nothing to stop them from maintaining both of those statuses, it was always going to be a tough job for the Portland Timbers to go to BMO Field and get any kind of result. I'm not necessarily surprised the Timbers lost in Toronto. I am, however, surprised (and disgusted, and annoyed) at the manner in which they lost, a 4-1 capitulation in which nobody in green - players or coaches - really emerges with any credit at all.
The Good
45 minutes. The first half started out so promisingly. The Timbers ran out their 14th different back four in 25 games, but this back four was reasonably strong, missing only Liam Ridgewell from what would be considered the optimal back four at this point in time. Lawrence Olum slotted in for Ridgewell, but otherwise, Alvas Powell, Larrys Mabiala, and Vytas are as close to a first choice defense as Portland has.
And for the entire first half, that defense not only held but didn't appear to be working too hard to do so. Toronto's best chance came from a dangerously placed Sebastian Giovinco free kick that Jake Gleeson pushed away, in his last significant action before going off with an injured hamstring; otherwise, the Timbers dealt with Toronto's multiple threats pretty well, closing off Michael Bradley and even creating a few chances of their own, chances that, frustratingly, they didn't convert. This would turn out to be deadly, because...
The Bad
45 more minutes. ...because then, the second half arrived. Toronto seemed to be more focused, and Portland kept up with them and carried on as they had in the first half, until Alvas Powell Alvas Powelled it up, doing...something that I can't identify instead of controlling a ball that Giovinco lofted into the area, that then fell really nicely for Justin Morrow to smash home and give Toronto the lead, which had the effect of opening the floodgates. And wow, did they open wide.
Alvas Powell. He was directly culpable for that first goal, he took a half-swipe at the pass that led to Giovinco's assist for the second goal, he took another half-swipe - while being out of position - at the ball leading to the third goal, and while he had absolutely nothing to do with the fourth goal, I'm going to blame him for it anyway because it feels like it was his fault just because.
Alvas Powell is not good enough to be a starting MLS defender. And yet he is the Timbers defender with the most starts this season - he's Porter's starting right back. Thing is, though, I don't blame Powell for being bad; I blame Caleb Porter for both continuing to start Powell and for failing to recognize last winter that he's clearly not good enough and failing to even try to upgrade.
"Alvas Powell getting beat" is not an uncommon theme | Source: Jeff Vinnick - Getty Images
The Ugly
Reactions. Here we are, back talking about intangibles, my least favorite thing to talk about. And yet, they're a problem again. After a goal, you as a player and you as a team have two choices: You can hang your head, kick at the ground, and wish you were somewhere else because this sucks and you hate everything, or you can suck it up, fight back, and try to right the ship.
Guess which one the Timbers chose on Saturday? The same one they chose against Real Salt Lake in early July. The same one they chose in Montreal and in San Jose in May. They chose to fold. The Timbers have lost four games this season by three goals, which if you're a team with league winning aspirations is really not good enough.
I'm not sure where best to apportion blame here, either. Should Caleb Porter shoulder the blame for not getting his team in the right frame of mind to deal with adversity? That's a coach's job, after all, to coach guys through these things. Should Caleb and Gavin Wilkinson get an outsized share of the blame, for recruiting players that crumble under pressure? Or should all the blame go to the players, who fell apart like a wet paper bag at the first sign of trouble on Saturday?
That's the thing, though - there probably is enough blame to go around. There's no smoking gun, no right answer. But there are a lot of wrong ones, and that's what the Timbers seem to be finding the most of these days. If that tendency doesn't get fixed, this team has some serious work to do this off season. And if that tendency doesn't get fixed, I have very little confidence that work will pay off.

February 2nd, 2018 by Clément Thiery (Translated from French by Alexander Uff)
The latest Clint Eastwood blockbuster inspired by the 2015 attack on the Thalys train from Amsterdam to Paris will be in U.S. theaters on February 9, 2018 (and on February 7 in France).
On August 21, 2015, a 25-year-old Moroccan man named Ayoub El Khazzani opened fire with a Kalashnikov on the Thalys train N°9364 traveling from Amsterdam to Paris with 554 passengers aboard. The would-be attacker's gun jammed, and several travelers seized the opportunity to overpower him. Three Americans (including two off-duty soldiers) were among the heroes who prevented a potential bloodbath. Anthony Sadler, Alek Skarlatos, and Spencer Stone all received the Légion d'Honneur.
These same three Americans are now on the bill of Clint Eastwood's 36th movie, in which they play themselves. The screenplay is adapted from the book The 15:17 to Paris: The True Story of a Terrorist, a Train, and Three American Heroes, cowritten by journalist Jeffrey E. Stern and the three young men. Anthony Sadler, a kinesiology student, Alek Skarlatos, a Specialist in the Oregon National Guard, and Spencer Stone, a U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant, were originally supposed to be played by professional actors. But the director changed his mind. “I thought, ‘Why not? Let's give it a try,'” he said to the website Extra. “They said, ‘Do you think we should be taking acting classes?' and I said, ‘No, maybe not.'”
Following on from American Sniper, a portrayal of the life of renowned sharpshooter Chris Kyle, and Sully, which offered a nail-biting reproduction of the “Miracle on the Hudson,” Clint Eastwood is back with another testosterone-fueled tale of the valiant everyman. These movies about “real-life heroes” have become a whole genre, laments British newspaper The Guardian. They often fall flat, stumbling on their macho approach and simplistic vision of events. And it seems The 15:17 to Paris is no exception.
However, a sizeable part of the movie was filmed in France, at the Arras train station where the train was diverted following the attack, and in Paris. Charles de Gaulle airport, the Gare du Nord, the Elysée Palace, the Hôtel de Marigny, and several streets in the north-east of Paris make on-screen appearances. French actor Patrick Bradoué plays President François Hollande, who presented the three Americans with the Légion d'Honneur for their acts of bravery.

These pictures show the amazing transformation of a family who have radically changed their lifestyle to slim down and get fit.
Businessman Dean Musgrave, 49, together with his family have lost an incredible six stone in just a few months - and the difference is astonishing.
Mr Musgrave, his wife Sammy, 36, and their daughter Alex, 17, have shed the pounds between them in just a few months after enlisting the help of personal trainer Tom Cowen, from Cottingham.
Mrs Musgrave, of west Hull, says she was determined to lose weight after feeling "uncomfortable" on a family holiday to America.
"I had previously done Slimming World but never really stuck to it," she said.

"I came across Tom's Facebook page and saw the results he had so messaged him and arranged to meet up."
Sammy embarked on Tom's Transformation group sessions back in July last year. She now also attends his bootcamps and one-to-one sessions.
"It's not just about the exercise , it is eating healthily too and Tom is great at offering his support," she said.
"It's now first nature for me and I find myself improving every session."
Sammy started her transformation weighing 10st 2lbs and was a "big" size 12. She now weighs 8st 1lbs and is a size 6/8.

Sammy has been supported throughout by husband Dean, 49, who also embarks on a gruelling training programme with Tom.
Since July, he has lost an incredible four stone and completely transformed his body. He said: "I feel so much fitter now than I ever have done.
"I've got more confidence and I am now really looking forward to our holiday to Mexico this summer."
Seeing the success her mum and dad were having, the couple's 17-year-old daughter Alex decided to join Tom's transformation and bootcamp classes.
She has lost more than a stone in just a few weeks.
(Image: Hull Daily Mail)
Mrs Musgrave told the Hull Daily Mail : "Alex was just like any other teenager, eating rubbish and drinking fizzy drinks, but when she couldn't get a pair of size 14 jeans on I think she realised the effect it had.
"We said we would pay for her to join Tom's transformation classes and she has really gone for it and she looks fantastic.
"As a family we are so much healthier and it's just great for us all."
Mr Cowen, whose fitness studio is based in King Street, Cottingham, offers dietary and exercise advice as well as one-to-one training sessions and group classes.
He has praised the Musgrave family's remarkable achievements.

Mr Cowen said: "If you have those you love around you doing the same as you then that extra support really helps.
"Dean, Sammy and Alex have made constant progress and really smashed these last couple of months.
"Collectively as a family they have lost 77lbs and made wholesale changes and are continuing to improve.
"I have always wanted to create a family atmosphere at my transformation and bootcamp classes and these guys are an integral part of that.
"I am so proud of them."
LAHORE - High concentration of arsenic has been detected from a water filtration plant at cattle market Shahpur Kanjran, exposing people in nearby localities to serious health hazards.
The laboratory of Ministry of Science and Technology - Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) - has confirmed alarmingly high concentration of this heavy metal in sample-144.4 microgram per litre, more than 14 times higher than the prescribed standards of World Health Organization (WHO).
Sources at PCRWR revealed that the sample for analysis of arsenic concentration was submitted by a private party and not the management of the cattle market.
“The sample was submitted by local people and not the management. They (local people) have told the PCRWR that the sample has been taken from filtration plant at Shahpur Kanjran. PCRWR can only confirm arsenic concentration in the sample. We can't confirm the location from where sample is taken,” said an official at PCRWR who wanted not to be named.
“The cattle market management has submitted samples for microbiology analysis. These samples also failed. The management has not got analysed any sample for arsenic concentration. It was submitted by private client while giving information about the site,” he added.
Officials at Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also raised question not about authenticity of the report but the sample's location.
“I don't know who has taken the sample and for what purpose. There is need of taking fresh sample from Shahpur Kanjran cattle market as per set criterion for sampling and its analysis from PCRWR and some other laboratories of good repute. The situation is really alarming if same arsenic concentration is found in fresh and properly taken sample,” EPA Director Naseem-ur-Rehman Shah told The Nation.
“EPA will definitely intervene to assess the real situation. We will get a fresh sample for evaluation of arsenic concentration in underground water of Shahpur Kanjran,” he added.
Another official at EPA, seeking anonymity, termed the report horrible, saying such high concentration of arsenic could put health and even life of people at risk. “We know concentration of arsenic in Lahore aquifer is higher than the WHO standards. But such a high concentration (144.4 milligram per litre) has never been detected from anywhere in Lahore.
“There is need of getting verification by taking fresh sample and analysis from quality laboratory,” he urged.
He further said that more than 150 factories, from Thokar Niaz Baig to Maraka, were disposing hazardous waste either in irrigation channels or by digging wells.
“Definitely these factories are polluting underground water. But high concentration of arsenic could not be attributed to activities of these factories. Arsenic is little or not a part of waste of these factories. As such there is need of first assessing the real situation by analysis of fresh sample and then detailed investigation to determine causes of high arsenic concentration.”
Medical experts are alarmed at detection of high concentration of arsenic in underground water of Lahore, saying consumption or even exposure to this water could cause severe complications including cancer in the skin, lungs, bladder and kidney.
“There is risk of lung and bladder cancer, skin changes when concentration of arsenic in drinking water is 50 milligram/litre or lower. But here arsenic concentration is 144.4 milligram/litre. It means people in the area are at much higher risk of getting diseases,” said Dr Abdul Rauf, a leading family physician, adding, even continuous inhalation of arsenic could cause lung cancer.
“Consumption of arsenic can cause severe vomiting, disturbances of the blood and circulation, damage to the nervous system, and eventually death. When not deadly, it can reduce blood cell production, break up red blood cells, enlarge liver, color skin, loss of sensation in limbs and brain damage,” Dr Rauf added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's Fox is hoping the creation of an independent editorial board to protect the news channel at bid target Sky (SKYB.L) will satisfy regulators and allow it to finally take control of the European pay-TV group.
Britain's competition regulator told Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA.O) last month that Murdoch's near eight-year, $15.7 billion pursuit of Sky would be blocked unless a way is found to prevent the media mogul from influencing Sky News after a deal.
Fox had earlier offered to create an editorial board with a majority of independent directors. People familiar with the matter, lawyers and investors believe a stronger mechanism to guarantee independence should be enough to gain approval.
The takeover is being closely watched in the United States where Fox has agreed to sell most of its assets including Sky to Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), which wants to buy all of Sky in the deal and not just the 39 percent that Fox already owns.
WORKING ON A SOLUTION
Fox is likely to have taken encouragement from a comment from the regulator that given that Fox may not own Sky for long, it will be willing to accept the most cost-effective solution.
“Fox are still confident they can get the deal done,” a person familiar with the situation said. “They're working on new suggestions for the remedies.”
As Britain's biggest owner of national newspapers, every move by Murdoch is scrutinised by his political allies and enemies alike. Britain's competition regulator worries that a deal to own all of Sky News would give him too much sway over public opinion.
Prime Minister Theresa May's government has the final say on the deal, but will have to stick to the regulator's advice or face possible legal action. Lawyers and consultants think Fox can land Sky by offering a fully independent board for Sky News and long-term funding, preventing it from having to make the more costly option of spinning off the channel or selling it completely. Sky, Europe's leading pay-TV provider in 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Austria, Germany and Italy, has kept up the pressure by warning it could close the loss-making but award-winning channel if it prevented a takeover. ROLLING NEWS
Sky News launched in 1989 when Murdoch, having shaken up the newspaper market, sought to smash the dominance of the BBC and commercial network ITV by launching four channels as part of a new paid-for satellite service. The 24-hour channel, the first in Britain to follow in the footsteps of global pioneer CNN, immediately gave the fledgling network visibility, and it has punched above its weight in terms of influence ever since. Watched closely in newsrooms, boardrooms and the offices of state, Sky News is a politically neutral outlet that has forced the taxpayer-funded BBC to up its game in rolling news. The challenge is to find a system that protects Sky News' independence without forcing so much separation that it puts the channel into financial jeopardy. Murdoch has funded Sky News through nearly 30 years of losses. It has an average weekly reach of 4.4 million viewers, or average share of TV viewing of 0.56 percent, according to BARB ratings for the week ended Jan. 21. It reaches millions more through its online and radio output. In its provisional findings, the competition regulator suggested a system where independent directors form an Editorial Board for Sky News, perhaps appointed by media regulator Ofcom. The Board would appoint the head of Sky News, who would in turn retain editorial control. The regulator has asked interested parties to respond. ”It is a difficult circle to square,“ said a competition lawyer who is familiar with the case. ”It has to be independent enough to still be a viable independent voice, but not so independent that it is left to wither away. “But it can be done.”

DISNEY DIMENSION
Were the government and regulator to decide that the proposal does not go far enough, they could insist that in order to complete the deal, Fox should spin off or sell Sky News. In 2011, when Murdoch last tried and failed to buy Sky, he offered to put the news outlet into a new company with shares given to existing Sky shareholders. Reviewing the different options, the regulator has noted that Sky News has never previously constituted a standalone business, perhaps indicating its fears about how it would fare. The regulator has also acknowledged that Sky could next year be owned by Disney, a business that doesn't have any news outlets in Britain, meaning its concerns would lapse. Fox is now working on a response and is likely to address the concerns raised by the regulator about its earlier plan, including how the board members would be appointed and whether a majority of independents would be enough.
Twenty-First Century Fox and Sky declined to comment.
“As long as Fox is willing to submit the right remedies, it will get done,” said one hedge fund manager with investments in both companies.
IS PRICE RIGHT?
But the lengthy process has caused agitation among some shareholders, who say Fox should now stump up more than the headline 10.75 pounds per share.
“Basically, here is Fox being bought-out on 12 times cashflow,” Crispin Odey, whose hedge fund is a 0.9 percent investor in Sky, said in December. “If we (Sky shareholders) were being sold on 12 times cashflow we'd be at 12.30 pounds.”
Activist investor Elliott Management Corp, founded by Paul Singer, has also built a stake in Sky of 1.29 percent.
One London-based adviser said: “An effective ring-fencing of Sky News in some form should solve all the concerns of the regulator. Once that is done, Elliott is likely to push for a better price.”
Media Secretary Matt Hancock has said he will rule on the deal by June 14.
If approved, it will go to a vote of Sky independent shareholders, paving the way for the 86-year-old Murdoch to finally get his hands on a company he has long coveted.
NEW YORK (Reuters) - High-ranking officials of the United States and North Korea met in New York late on Wednesday in the first of two days of talks about the future of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program and a possible summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, a close aide of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, met for about 90 minutes over dinner and exited without providing any detailed remarks to reporters waiting outside.
Pompeo would only say that the dinner “was great” and that the two men dined on “American beef.”
It was not yet known whether the two men made any progress toward narrowing long-standing differences between Washington and Pyongyang that could end decades of hostile relations.
Earlier in the day, the White House left open the possibility of a Trump-Kim summit on June 12 in Singapore, despite Trump's cancellation of the meeting just days ago.
As the dinner was underway inside an apartment on New York's East Side, just south of the United Nations, a senior State Department official separately briefed reporters on the high-level talks that were underway.
Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, vice chairman of the ruling Workers' Party's Central Committee, “are trying to get to know each other” following their two initial meetings this year in North Korea, said the U.S. official who asked not to be identified.
The official added that before any summit between the two leaders can occur, Pyongyang is “going to have to make clear what they are willing to do” amid demands from Washington that North Korea permanently end its nuclear weapons program.
Trump, the official said, “can make a fly or no-fly decision anytime he wants,” referring to the possible unprecedented Singapore summit.
If not enough progress is made to lead to a productive meeting between Trump and Kim Jong-un, the official said, “We will ramp up the pressure on them and we'll be ready for the day that hopefully they are ready.”
Shortly before Wednesday's dinner, Pompeo repeated the Trump administration's bottom-line demand:
“Looking forward to meeting with Kim Yong Chol in New York to discuss @Potus potential summit with Chairman Kim. We are committed to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula @StateDept,” Pompeo said in a Twitter post.
Trump last week called off the summit after North Korea expressed anger at comments by senior U.S. officials. But Trump later said he was reconsidering his position and U.S., North Korean and South Korean officials have gone ahead with summit preparations.

The White House said on Wednesday that negotiations at the demilitarized zone along the border between North and South Korea for the summit were going well.
Separately on Wednesday at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Admiral Harry Harris, the outgoing head of U.S. Pacific Command who is Trump's pick to be the ambassador to South Korea, said North Korea remained the United States' most imminent threat. “And a nuclear-capable North Korea with missiles that can reach the United States is unacceptable,” Harris said.
Earlier, a U.S. official said negotiations about the summit's agenda have so far been slow going, and the two fundamental issues, the definition of North Korean denuclearization and whether both sides would take actions at the same time or separately, remained unsettled.
‘DENUCLEARIZATION'
Trump has sworn not to allow North Korea to develop nuclear missiles that could hit the United States and wants North Korea to “denuclearize,” or get rid of its nuclear arms.
But the leadership in Pyongyang is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival and has rejected unilaterally disarming.
The Trump administration, according to U.S. officials, has left open the possibility of North Korea eventually getting U.S. aid and investments if Pyongyang agrees to complete denuclearization.
North Korea's position going into the meetings with Pompeo was that a pledge of denuclearization alone should open the way to economic relief, said the official who briefed reporters earlier on Wednesday and spoke on condition of anonymity.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted Seoul's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon as saying in a speech on Wednesday that the differences between North Korea and the United States on the denuclearization issue remained “quite significant” and it would not be easy to narrow the gap.
However, Cho added that the engagement of the leaders of the two countries meant “chances are high that common ground can be found.”
Kim Yong Chol is the most senior North Korean official to meet top officials for talks in the United States since Jo Myong Rok, a vice marshal, met then-President Bill Clinton at the White House in 2000.

A former military spy chief, he has played a central role in the thaw in relations over the past six months between North Korea and South Korea, as well as the United States.
North Korea defends its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against what it sees as U.S. ambitions to overthrow its leadership and unite the Korean Peninsula. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War.
It all started as a bit of a joke… but ended in a pretty good cover.
Back in December, a Cleveland-area teenager named Mary created a Twitter account called @weezerafrica and tweeted at Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo, “It's about time you bless the rains down in Africa.”
Joke or not, roughly 340 tweets later, including a retweet of an endorsement of the project from Toto singer David Paich, Mary has gotten her wish. The band has unveiled its cover of “Africa” with a screenshot of her original tweet in the artwork.

Run, Don't Walk! This Casino's Going To Blow by David Stockman – Contra Corner
Yesterday afternoon brought three salient statements from Washington financial authorities that boil down to a simple admonition. To wit, if you are still in the Wall Street casino, run don't walk toward the nearest emergency exit.
We are referring first to the CBO's warning that Uncle Sam will run out of cash by early March if the debt ceiling is not raised sharply.
That warning was coupled, in turn, with the Treasury Department's estimate that it will need to sell the staggering sum of $617 billion in new debt during the next five months. And, by the way, that short interval happens to include Q2 when the great annual fleecing of taxpayers causes a bulge in collections.
Finally, the Fed's post-meeting statement assured that all is awesome with respect to the main street economy:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.
Whew!
After all, the following chart might have been unnerving in the absence of the FOMC's glowing confidence that the US economy is stronger than an ox and therefore, presumably, capable of shouldering the current eruption of Federal red ink.
Still, a crucial question recurs: Just because the US Treasury is happy to march the public debt across the $21 trillion mark, it doesn't mean there are 60 votes in the Senate or 218 in the House for the same.
So in light of the above discordance, we now commence some ruminations on how both ends of the Acela Corridor have ended up in an economic fantasyland like no other. Fittingly, the origins of the latter are squarely rooted in the Eccles Building, and the imminent departure of Janet Yellen, mercifully, provides the perfect jumping off point.
The above quoted meeting statement is pure Yellen. That is, the ritual gumming of a Keynesian school marm which is utterly irrelevant to what the Fed is actually doing, and dead wrong besides.
The entirety of the four paragraphs statement consists of rubbery expressions of the Fed's satisfaction that its goals for the labor market, inflation and economic activity are unfolding nicely. The only fly in the ointment, of course, is that the Fed's interest rate manipulations and balance sheet inflation have had almost no impact on the said objectives.
In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate ar 1-1/4 to 1‑1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
We will address tomorrow why the Fed has been tilting at macro-economic windmills for years.
But first it needs be noted that we are already at 2.00% inflation even by the BLS' sawed-off measuring stick. During the last 12 readings, the year-over-year CPI has been at or above the Fed's target 75% of the time, and has posted an average gain of 2.14%.
If the Fed were a decent economic parent, therefore, it would have told the boys and girls on Wall Street that we are already “there” long ago. As it happens, in fact, the chart below means that in its wisdom the FOMC yesterday choose to stand pat in month #104 of the current expansion with a real funds rate at negative 0.8%.
Sharing is caring!

By Jemima Kelly
LONDON, Feb (Reuters) - Sterling slipped on Friday, hit by weak data from Britain's construction sector, but was nevertheless on track for its seventh straight week of gains against the dollar - the pound's best run since 2012.
Britain's construction sector came close to contracting for the first time since September last month as uncertainty linked to Brexit caused new orders to dry up, data showed.
Sterling slipped to the day's low of $1.4210 after the data, down around a third of a percent on the day. It was also 0.2 percent weaker against the euro, at 87.82 pence .
“The PMI construction data today certainly could have had an impact, and certainly sterling is a bit softer, but I‘m wondering if there could be a reassessment going on in sterling,” Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said.
For the week, sterling was still up almost half a percent against the dollar. Analysts say the currency is being supported by a repricing of Bank of England interest rate hike expectations - several banks are now calling for a rise to come in May, and for another to come later in the year.
That follows testimony on Tuesday from BoE Governor Mark Carney, who sounded a more upbeat tone than previously, saying how wage growth was finally picking up and that the focus of the BoE is shifting back to tackling above-target inflation.
“There does seem to be a will in the Bank of England to reduce policy accommodation. If it weren't for the Brexit-related risks, I would be very confident that they will (hike) twice this year,” Foley added.
The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee is seen as almost certain to keep rates at 0.50 percent when it meets next week, however.
Sterling has also been helped in recent weeks by a lack of major bad news around Brexit, analysts say. Markets largely brushed aside talk of a leadership challenge to British Prime Minister Theresa May, as well as a House of Lords report that said her Brexit legislation plans contained “fundamental flaws”.
Data last week showed speculators added to their bets on the pound strengthening further in the most recent week, with net-long positions at their highest since mid-2014.
“While the front-end BoE rates market has sold off plenty and sterling has moved significantly higher (against the dollar), we think both moves have further to go,” wrote Nomura currency strategist Jordan Rochester in a note to clients late on Thursday. (Editing by Angus MacSwan)

Netflix has ordered a new 10-episode installment of “Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City,” Variety has learned.
As previously announced when it was revealed the series was in development, Laura Linney and Olympia Dukakis will reprise their roles as Mary Ann Singleton and Anna Madrigal respectively. In addition, Barbara Garrick, who played DeDe Halcyon Day in the original miniseries, is also set to return.
Finally, “Juno” and “Inception” star Ellen Page will join the series as Shawna, Mary Ann's daughter.
Based on the books by Maupin, the new installment follows Mary Ann, who returns home to San Francisco and is reunited with her daughter and ex-husband Brian, twenty years after leaving them behind to pursue her career. Fleeing the midlife crisis that her picture perfect Connecticut life created, Mary Ann returns home to her chosen family and will quickly be drawn back into the orbit of Anna Madrigal and the residents of 28 Barbary Lane.
Production is expected to start later this year with the show slated to debut in 2019.
Lauren Morelli, who previously worked as a writer and co-executive producer on the Netflix series “Orange Is the New Black,” will serve as writer, showrunner, and executive producer. Maupin will executive produce along with Linney. Alan Poul returns to direct and executive produce.

“Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City” is a Working Title Television and NBCUniversal International studios production for Netflix. Working Title's Andrew Stearn, Liza Chasin, Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner also executive produce. Michael Cunningham will serve as a consulting producer.
The book series has long been hailed as a cultural touchstone for the LGBT, with the novels being among the first to address the AIDS crisis.
PBS carried the original six-part “Tales” miniseries in January 1994, which generated controversy in some regions for its depiction of LGBT relationships. Showtime ran the subsequent miniseries, 1998's “More Tales of the City” and 2001's “Further Tales of the City.”

A professional football coach who ran a soccer school near Bristol for years used his ‘supreme power' over the future careers of ambitious teenage players to carry out a ‘systematic campaign of sexual abuse' spanning a quarter of a century, a court has heard.
Bob Higgins, who also ran the youth team coaching for Southampton Football Club and Peterborough United as well as the Maltese Football Association, is accused of using his position to act with ‘near impunity' against the trainees, several of whom went on to become professional players.
The 65-year-old is on trial at Salisbury Crown Court accused of 50 accounts of indecent assault against 24 complainants dating between 1971 and 1996.
Adam Feest QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations against Higgins were made after ex-pro player Andy Woodward, of Crewe Alexandra, appeared on the BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme and spoke of the abuse he suffered from an unconnected coach.
He said this led to the NSPCC setting up a helpline, adding: "The telephone started to ring and one name was mentioned over and over again - that is the name of Bob Higgins, this defendant."
Higgins was a high-profile and well-known coach of promising teenage footballers and, as well as his role at professional clubs like Southampton and Peterborough, he also set up and ran his own soccer schools, including one at Newton St Loe, near Keynsham, which attracted scores of young players from Bristol and Bath during the 1980s and 90s - between 1988 and 1992.
Mr Feest said Higgins was a ‘talented coach' who was ‘idolised' by the young players he trained to the extent that “young teenagers often turned down more prestigious clubs so that they could train with him at Southampton FC, hoping that by doing so they would have the best possible chance of becoming professional footballers."
He said: "During this time there was a much darker aspect to the defendant's character and behaviour, an aspect which his footballing roles, and the power that came with them, gave him the opportunity to pursue and to indulge.
(Image: PA)
"Throughout this period, this defendant was carrying out a widespread campaign of sexual abuse against many of those in his charge.
"The young footballers came to idolise the defendant. He, in their eyes, held supreme power over their footballing futures, a fact which he made abundantly clear to them.
"The boys realised that they needed to impress their coach and particularly those, perhaps, with slightly less footballing talent, to keep in his good books both on and off the training pitches.
"The defendant manipulated these feelings and desires, making sure that in order not to feel left out, the young teenagers would join in with the general sexualised behaviour, their infatuation in him and no doubt their naivety of the world making them blind to the real nature of it."
Mr Feest added: "Once their trust had been gained and their devotion to him made absolute, this predatory paedophile with a sexual interest in young boys was able to act with near impunity.
"After all, if any of these boys did ever complain, thereby putting any hopes they might have of playing professional football in serious jeopardy, who would believe them bearing in mind the position the defendant held and the prevailing atmosphere that existed at the time."
Mr Feest said the abuse allegedly occurred in training, during massage sessions and in the defendant's car and home while some of the boys stayed overnight.
Many of the alleged victims of football coach Bob Higgins told police their "shame and embarrassment" prevented them from coming forward earlier to tell of their allegations, a court has heard.
(Image: PA)
Adam Feest QC, prosecuting, said that it was only when the issue of abuse at football clubs was raised on television that many of them felt able to speak about their own alleged experiences when aged in their early teens.
He told Salisbury Crown Court: "For many of these people, now all grown men, this was the first time they had ever been able to speak about their abuse at the defendant's hands.
"Some had made brief mention to loved ones nearer the time, albeit unable through unfounded shame or embarrassment to go into any detail, whilst others have only felt able to tell their wives or friends since they spoke to the police."
Mr Feest said that the complainants, apart from one, were connected to the defendant through football and added: "Particular types of behaviour came to light time and time again from people who did not know each other, or who have not spoken for years since their footballing days.
(Image: PA)
"Being touched whilst being given naked soapy water massages, laying with their heads on his lap in a car whilst he either groped himself or tried to fondle them.
"Getting sexually assaulted under the pretext of being shown a training drill or being examined for injury."
The jury was told the alleged abuse was carried out at training sessions and at the defendant's home.
The complainants, several of whom went on to become professional players, describe how Higgins would sexually assault them while giving them soapy massages after training sessions, Mr Feest said.
He added that one complainant said that after he "tensed up" during a massage, he "found himself as substitute for the next training session".
Mr Feest said that one former top-level player has said that he was abused by Higgins at the defendant's home which some of the boys would use as a meeting point.
(Image: PA)
The prosecutor said: "He recalls standing there for a while going through what had just happened in his mind, almost in a state of disbelief."
He added: "He also recalls going to the training camp and getting naked soapy water massages from the defendant.
"He is unsure whether or not he was touched sexually during these but does recall that the defendant took a lot more time and was a lot more thorough than the other coaches."
Mr Feest said that another of the complainants regarded Higgins "like a God" and saw him as a "father figure" and said that the defendant ordered another boy to sleep naked when he stayed at his home.
The list of alleged victims includes Southampton youth player Billy Seymour, who went on to play for Coventry City and Millwall.
Higgins, of Southampton, Hampshire, denies the charges and the trial continues

Two Orangeburg men have been charged with murder in last week's fatal shooting near Santee, according to Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell.
“These arrests came about by simply staying the course and staying on the trail that led to these individuals,” Ravenell said. “A day, a week, a year – we don't stop until we've located, as in this case, individuals who have committed murder and then try to slip away.”
Alphonso Fields, 27, and Laron Thomas, 25, have each been charged with one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder, and one count of armed robbery.
During a hearing on Friday, Orangeburg County magistrate Sam Daily deferred bond on Thomas to a circuit court judge at a later date.
Fields, however, declined to be present for his court appearance. His case will still move forward regardless of his no show Friday.
The investigation began when a 24-year-old man died after shots were fired during a robbery on Sept. 26 at an Old Number Six Highway residence near Santee. Two others at the residence were wounded in the shooting.
Witnesses said that just after 10 p.m. they saw two men approach a neighboring home after a vehicle pull onto that property.
Moments later, gunfire was heard coming from the direction of the nearby home. The two men seen earlier were seen again running from the home. One appeared to be holding his side.
When deputies arrived they found three men laying on the ground, one deceased. The two wounded victims were taken to undisclosed hospitals.
According to the warrants, a .357 handgun and an AR-15 rifle were taken from the victims.
“These individuals needed to be taken off the street,” Ravenell said, “and they were.”
Investigator Marty Carrigg is leading the ongoing investigation.

In the Alabama Republican Senate race, every candidate wants to be just like Donald Trump.
But in Tuesday's primary, the leading candidate sounds and acts more like the president, while it's the incumbent, an appointed senator just fighting to make it into a likely runoff, who has Trump's actual blessing — but also the curse of being Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's favorite candidate.
That's the conundrum of the Republican contest, largely seen as a three-way race between front-runner Roy Moore, a controversial former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice; Sen. Luther Strange, appointed back in February to fill the seat of now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions; and Rep. Mo Brooks, who's seized on an anti-McConnell platform as the president's attacks against the Senate's top Republican have intensified recently.
Moore has consistently polled atop the field, and looks likely to claim a spot in a probable September runoff. His ads sound downright Trumpian, promising to "drain the swamp" and taking a swipe at D.C. elites.
Moore is well-known throughout the state — and the country — too. He first gained national notoriety when he refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from a state judicial building despite a federal court order; Moore himself was then removed from his position as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003. He won election to the same post again in 2012, but was then suspended after he ordered judges to enforce the state's ban on same-sex marriage despite the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in favor of gay marriage nationwide under the federal Constitution. He resigned earlier this year to challenge Strange.
To state observers, it's not surprising that Moore has been able to build a strong following and even expand beyond what might be his typical conservative base in the state.
"Alabama voters supported Trump because he spoke his mind and said all the things they had been thinking about government," said Brent Buchanan, a GOP strategist and pollster in the state. "Out of all the candidates, Roy Moore has some of those similar characteristics. You may not agree with all of his policy or personal preferences, but you know that Roy Moore is going to do what Roy Moore believes."
That's why it was so, well, strange last week when Trump tweeted out his support for Strange, saying the incumbent has his "complete and total endorsement!"
The senator has benefited from millions of dollars in ads from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. The very next day after endorsing Strange, Trump started going on Twitter tirades against the GOP Senate leader for failing to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
Strange has tried to prove his loyalty to the president ever since he was appointed under less than auspicious circumstances. As Alabama's attorney general, Strange was investigating then-Gov. Robert Bentley for misuse of his office amid a sex scandal when Bentley chose Strange to replace Sessions. Facing impeachment, Bentley eventually resigned, and the new governor, Kay Ivey, moved up the date for the special election to replace Sessions long-term.
Polling done in the wake of Trump's surprise endorsement showed that the president's blessing had done little — yet — to move the needle toward Strange. One by cygnal, Buchanan's firm, conducted partly after the endorsement, showed Moore still with a lead and high favorables, Strange remained static and it was Brooks who took a hit.
Buchanan said the Trump endorsement could help Strange turn out some who were less likely to vote on Tuesday, which could be key in what's already expected to be a very low-turnout affair.
And the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC also announced late Friday it would be spending up to $200,000 on digital ads targeting Trump voters to encourage them to come out for Strange.
However, although he's slipping in polling, Brooks is hoping to turn McConnell's fervent support for Strange into a last-ditch way to get into the likely runoff against Moore. He's hitched a "Ditch Mitch" banner to his campaign bus in the final days, and in his closing ad he echoes Trump's frustration with McConnell's inability to push through an Obamacare repeal.
"McConnell and Strange are weak, but together we can be strong," Brooks says. "Mr. President, isn't it time we tell McConnell and Strange, 'You're fired?'"
Ultimately, the Huntsville-area congressman hasn't had the resources the other two candidates have had, and he hasn't been elected statewide before like Moore and Strange. And, perhaps most damaging, he was certainly no fan of Trump during the GOP presidential primaries last year, during which he supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. McConnell's super PAC has pointed that out in ads, saying Brooks sided with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
If Strange does fall short of the runoff, University of Alabama political science professor emeritus William Stewart, a longtime political observer in the state, said that's a big problem for McConnell. And, if Strange does make it to the likely September runoff, expect that to be a big point Moore can use against Strange, too.
"The McConnell support for Strange will not be helpful because McConnell, as the president says, hasn't been successful at pushing through the president's agenda, " Stewart said. "If Strange doesn't make the runoff, that's a definite blow to McConnell," more so than Trump.
Polling shows Moore is still the favorite against Strange in a runoff, and that's where the McConnell ties could be the most deadly — and place the president in a more precarious spot given his surprising endorsement. Stewart said it would be interesting to watch how much Trump puts his muscle behind Strange later, and something like traveling to Alabama — one of Trump's best states in 2016 — for a rally on the senator's behalf would certainly give Strange a boost.
No matter who wins the GOP nomination though, they'll be the heavy favorite in the December general election, even if it's the more controversial Moore. Democrats are expected to nominate Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, though he could face a runoff against the aptly-named Robert Kennedy Jr., a Naval veteran who is not related to the famous Democratic political family.
If Moore is the GOP nominee, it will be interesting to watch whether the Democrats can make it even a mildly competitive contest — something Stewart, the former University of Alabama professor, said is doubtful, and is emblematic of the problems the party faces overall in the South.
"Right now the Democratic Party is very impotent here," Stewart said. "I think whomever the Republicans choose as their nominee will be the winner."

San Francisco Coffee Roaster Teams with Cannabis Startup for THC Cold Brew
Ritual Coffee Roasters is high on producing a new kind of morning Joe. The San Francisco-based company has partnered with Bay Area cannabis startup Somatik to provide the beans for a cannabis-infused cold brew.
According to The San Francisco Chronicle, the cold brew comes in 8 oz. bottles and contains with 15mg of THC (roughly 1.5 times the average dosage for edibles). Somatik CEO Chris Schroeder described the coffee as having a chocolatey flavor with notes of citrus and currant, with only “subtle notes” of cannabis.
The coffee retails for $12 per bottle and is sold at two cannabis dispensaries, one in San Francisco and the other in Oakland.
California Lawmaker Wants Plastic Caps Tethered to Bottles
A California lawmaker wants to limit environmental damage caused by stray bottle caps and has introduced a bill that would require plastic caps to be tethered to the bottle.
According to The Sacramento Bee, Assembly Bill 319 would bar retailers from selling beverages in bottles with untethered caps. If passed, the regulation would go into effect in 2020.
“By requiring that those lids stay attached to the plastic bottles that consumers use, we can ensure that they are part of California's successful recycling programs and not in landfills or the environment,” said Assemblyman Mark Stone, who introduced the bill. “Californians have been very clear about their desire to protect our communities from plastic pollution, and AB 319 is a clear step in pursuing that intent.”
Whole Foods to Close Nine Stores
Whole Foods Market last week announced that it will close nine stores this spring, according to CNBC. According to the report, the natural foods retailer plans to abandon its goal of opening more than 1,200 stores in favor of a more “disciplined growth” model. The announcement came during a recent earnings call to analysts.
Although the company shuttering some locations, Whole Foods added 14 new stores in Q1 2017. CEO and co-founder John Mackey told analysts the company has seen “modest traffic improvement from Q4 to Q1” and that 2017 is off to a “strong start for the first five weeks.”
The Secret History of the LaCroix Label
Bon Appétit dug into the backstory behind the design of LaCroix sparkling water's increasingly iconic label design last month with a feature profile of the brand and package designers.
The food and beverage website spoke with Lyle Zimmerman, head of design firm Alchemy Brand Group, the company that defied convention in the early 2000s and created the now iconic label for LaCroix's 12 oz. cans.
“In a sea of logos that were more sedate, precious in size, and often sans serif, the script denoted movement, energy, and fluidity—all traits applicable to water and especially the effervescence of LaCroix,” Zimmerman said.

Kara Goldin Resigns From NACIE in Defiance of President Trump
Hint Water CEO Kara Goldin this month announced that she has quit the National Advisory Council On Innovation and Entrepreneurship (NACIE) after only four months, writing in a Medium post that she believes U.S. President Donald Trump will not listen to the advice or guidance of the council.
Goldin began what was to be a two-year term on the council in October, 2016.
“I am resigning from NACIE because I believe that we now have a President that has no interest in advice, that is pursuing power as an end in and of itself and that has no intention of solving real problems or creating real opportunities for the people of this great nation,” Goldin wrote. “More importantly, as the leader of an innovative company that's helping America get healthier, I feel a deep obligation to our employees, our investors and our customers to distance myself from the sexism, racism, protectionism and hate that has defined the Trump administration's first days in office.”
Just days before Avengers: Infinity War hits theaters, former Marvel comics head Stan Lee has been sued over allegations of sexual misconduct, according to TMZ. The publication reports that Chicago massage therapist Maria Carballo is suing Lee and his former assistant Max Anderson after she claims he touched himself and allegedly tried to use her foot for sexual pleasure while she was massaging him. (Bustle reached out to a rep for Lee for comment and to the Cook County, Illinois Circuit Court, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.)
In court documents reportedly attained by the site, Carballo claimed that these massages took place two days in a row when she came to provide massages to Lee in his hotel room a year ago. She said she left after Lee allegedly began touching himself while on the table during the first visit, and when she came back for the second visit, he allegedly did it again. As Carballo claimed in the suit, she then threatened to leave, but stayed because Lee allegedly got angry. She then alleges he grabbed her foot during a Shiatsu massage and rubbed it against his genitals. Carballo claimed she then immediately left.
Now, Carballo is suing for over $50,000 in damages. Although Lee hasn't yet shared a statement in his own words, his business partner, Keya Morgan, denied Carballo's claims to TMZ and brought up Lee's assistant at the time, Anderson, who's also listed as a defendant in the suit.

"I have no idea what the convict Max Anderson did, but Stan Lee is 95 years old, completely harmless, and is 100 percent innocent, and denies any such false accusations," Morgan told the site. (According to the Daily Mail, Anderson is a convicted felon; Anderson could not be reached for comment.)
Carballo also claimed that when she left the second massage appointment, she was paid $240 for her services, and that Lee's assistant allegedly tried to give her a tip by handing her "a wad of money" when she was on her way out, which she claims could have been because he was aware of the misconduct that allegedly happened during the visit.
People shared more details of the lawsuit, including that the incident allegedly took place in April 2017 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. The magazine reported that the owner of the company Carballo worked for allegedly told her that "appeasing VIP clients" was important and shared an apology from Lee, which lead her to go back for the second appointment. When she arrived at the hotel the next day, Carballo claimed that four security guards, the Hyatt's concierge, and members of Lee's team all met her to apologize again for Lee's behavior the day before. (Bustle reached out to Hyatt for comment, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.)
According to the Chicago Tribune, Carballo's attorney, Alexandra Reed-Lopez, confirmed that she did file a police report on March 16, and police have said that an investigation is ongoing. Reed-Lopez confirmed to Bustle that Carballo has sued Lee, and in a statement said, "Ms. Carballo's complaint contains five counts, including assault, battery, violation of the Illinois Gender Violence Act, emotional distress and civil conspiracy."
Gender Violence Act, emotional distress and civil conspiracy.
One of Lee's lawyers, Jonathan Freund, told the Tribune that Lee was shocked by Carballo's claims and that they are unaware of a criminal investigation. “He is a high-profile public figure and I think it's a shakedown,” Freund said. “The guy is 95, I don't think he would do that.” He also added that Lee plans to "defend his rights vigorously." (Bustle reached out to Freund for additional comment, but did not receive a response at the time of publication.)
People also added that Carballo said in the suit that she was inspired to come forward because of the #MeToo movement so she could "fight for her dignity by standing up for herself,” although she claimed that initially she feared reporting the alleged incident to police could "hurt her job" because of Lee's wealth and influence.
Lee is only the latest in a string of Hollywood men who have been accused of sexual assault and misconduct over the last year. If Carballo wins her suit, she's asking for a judgment "in excess of $50,000, plus an award of punitive damages, and attorneys' fees and costs as permitted under the statute," according to People.

* MONOLITH MATERIALS, INC FILES TO SAY IT HAS RAISED $85 MILLION IN EQUITY FINANCING FROM A TOTAL OFFERING AMOUNT OF $125 MILLION - SEC FILING​ Source text : [bit.ly/2DVDIIG]
The voices calling for an immediate return to playoff contention for the New York Rangers have become deafening at times these days.
It only seems like every major media outlet and online Rangers fan forum has at least explored the possibility of such an approach for the organization's rebuild. Turn it over quickly by adding some star veterans, the thinking goes, and they'll lead the kids back into the postseason sooner rather than later.
These speculative stories cite cases such as the Edmonton Oilers and the Buffalo Sabres—clubs that have been “building” forever, consistently picking at or near the top of the draft, yet unable to escape NHL purgatory and return to making perennial playoff appearances. That the idea of building a powerhouse patiently and gradually with young players, enduring some pain along the way, is at least in some cases pure myth.
And while that point is accurate, all of the noise begs the question: do the Rangers really have a realistic choice?
It's difficult to envision how the Blueshirts will be ready to start consistently contending next season or even the one after that, given their needs. Those aren't much—only an elite goal scorer, a No. 1 center, a steady and competent defense, forward depth and some badly needed grit up front, just for starters.
This club's holdovers, both young and older, are question marks after an ugly 2017-18 season, with hardly an untouchable on the roster. The bevy of prospects and draft picks is exciting, but those are unproven commodities that even in the best-case scenario might not pay dividends for years.
So trade some of them for superlative Ottawa defenseman Erik Karlsson, the voices say. Ranger fans want to sign John Tavares, and not just because he's the star center they crave (anything to tweak Islanders fans). Those two will revitalize the roster and put the team back on track sooner rather than later, goes the theory.
Karlsson or Tavares in Blueshirts a Long Shot
Everything about that scenario, however, has longshot written all over it. Not only the possibility of adding one or both players—but that even if Karlsson AND Tavares landed with the Rangers, the club would start to resemble Pittsburgh in posing a consistent threat to emerge from the Eastern Conference playoffs and play for the Stanley Cup every spring.
The roster just isn't nearly good enough. There's too much work to do for any one (or two) player(s) to lift it back to the heights of 2014 and 2015 yet. Not even if those players' names were Crosby and McDavid (OK, maybe in that case, yes).
“We're looking for someone who can develop players and develop a team,” Madison Square Garden executive chairman Jim Dolan said last week in discussing who will replace Alain Vigneault as coach. “We want someone who is going to be able to work with young players — all of our players, really — so that they and we improve from one stage of the season to the next and we're better at the end of the year than at the beginning.
“The guy we hire has to be a developmental coach, I can't stress that enough,” Dolan said during the same interview.
That doesn't sound like an ownership that expects to make the playoffs next season.
The price for Karlsson would be immense, costing the Rangers a large chunk of the future assets they've acquired. And that might be OK if Karlsson was signed for several more seasons (he's not, with a contract expiring after 2018-19) and young and without significant injury history (he'll be 29 when his deal ends, and has suffered numerous injuries to his legs and feet in recent seasons).
Even if the Rangers were to pull the trigger on such a trade, would Karlsson want to stay past next season? At this point in his career, with the clock ticking on his prime, would he want to commit long-term to a club that may need two to three seasons at the very least to contend for a championship?
A more likely trade suitor would seem to be a team that's a current contender or right on the verge of becoming one, and is willing to give up the future assets—and commit to a long contract that would tie it to Karlsson during his years of decline – for a difference-making veteran defenseman that could put a good roster over the top.
Likewise for Tavares, who over the past season has proven to be a thoughtful, introspective athlete that won't be pressured into a decision on his future. At age 27, in his superstar prime and about to hit the free-agent market, does he want to join his current team's archrivals who probably don't have the adequate depth around him to become a Cup contender until his best days are beginning to wane? Given that, would the Rangers still be able to count on him as a top center when they are in fact ready to contend again?
Gradual Approach the Likely Focus for Management
These moves are of course possible, and the Rangers can certainly place a bid for Tavares that will be competitive with any other club. Adding him would be a coup. But as exciting as such additions might be in theory, there's a whiff of irresponsibility, especially in the case of a Karlsson deal. With the defense a mess, the roster in need of remaking and a grittier new identity sought, it's difficult to envision that the right route is to add those two players at great cost and expect them to work miracles.
The voices also mention the Rangers' finally favorable salary cap situation, with the club expected to be at least $25 million below the threshold next season. But did general manager Jeff Gorton put in the effort to clean up the cap problem over the last two seasons to simply blow it up again for two players? Tavares will cost between $10-12 million per season; Karlsson should at least approach double digits. How will Gorton re-sign ascending young players and add help over the next few seasons if he's once again forced to count every dollar, as he did while the Rangers were actually contending?
It seems more plausible that management would hoard that space for future seasons, when it's clear that the club is turning the corner and one or two key additions will allow it to reach the next level of its rebuild. Not to mention the impending near certainty of an excruciating buyout of Marc Staal's contract, which has three seasons left to run at $5.7 million per.
Last Rangers Core was Built Gradually With Youth
So while there's validity to the argument that starting over with youth is no guarantee, it's difficult to see what other route the Rangers can take to travel back to the perennial contention that wasn't that long ago. Speaking of that, it's worth remembering that those teams were constructed largely with strong drafting, shrewd trades for and signings of younger players and eventually, key veteran additions. That sustainable, cost-effective model for the salary cap era allowed the Blueshirts to reach the playoffs in 11 of 12 seasons and make it to three Conference Finals and one Stanley Cup Final before missing the tournament in 2017-18.
The Rangers helped pioneer that approach for a new era of NHL economics, and they weren't working with nearly the same amount of high-ceiling future assets they have now. So impatient fans and media might have to settle for a useful veteran stopgap signing or two this offseason, perhaps Ilya Kovalchuk, and the trading of some assets with the emphasis still on the future.
In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with getting excited about Libor Hajek, Ryan Lindgren, Brett Howden, Filip Chytil, Lias Andersson and a bunch of draft picks as the Rangers commit to the process of building a team that makes the playoffs every season and contends for championships.
After all, they've done it before.

Janelle Wood is on a mission.
The Arizona State University and Phoenix Seminary graduate has been on that mission since she gave birth to a son, years ago.
Her prayer, she said, is that she'll be a “radiant light in dark spaces” who leaves a legacy of hope, peace and love.
Wood and other parents in the Phoenix area's Black Mothers Forum are game-changers in the fight for education equality for Black children.
Led by Wood, who has served as a pastor in a women's prison and as Chief of Staff for the Phoenix City Council, the group has taken the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), the education law passed during the Obama Administration, very seriously. The Black parents' group is using ESSA to leverage their awareness and involvement in their children's education and to ensure that African American students excel in the public-school system.
“We, as Black mothers, have come together to collectively address the concerns that we have with our Black sons and daughters being pushed out of their schools at an alarmingly higher rate than their White peers all over the nation,” Wood said.
The mission of the Black Mothers Forum, Wood explained, is to educate parents on their rights with respect to student discipline and a culturally-inclusive curriculum, while also getting organized through focus groups that allow members of the forum to execute a course of action to effectively make structural changes.
“We do this by meeting multiple times a month and having various experts come in from various organizations to educate and train our mothers on knowing their rights, sharing a culturally-integrated curriculum and learning [the signs and symptoms] of any mental health challenges our children may be experiencing,” Wood said.
For instance, the group has entered partnerships with the ACLU's Demand 2 Learn programs, Arizona State University's Center for the Study of Race and Democracy, and other initiatives.
Members of the Black Mothers Forum also completed a 13-week course on Black history to help develop a deeper understanding of their ancestors so that they could properly inform their children.
“We attend high school and grade school district board meetings regularly and address the disproportionate suspensions and dismissals of our students of color for minor infractions,” said Gwendolyn Payton, a Black Mothers Forum member, who also serves in the Equality division of the organization. “As a result of speaking out, schools are contacting us to come on campus and be visible and interact with our students of color. We challenge the schools to include more culturally diverse curriculum and activities and to hire more teachers and principals of color.”
In February, when a Black Phoenix charter school student was pulled out of school after officials claimed the boy's hair braids violated school policy, the Black Mothers Forum sprang into action to defend the youth causing the district to issue a mea culpa and welcome the child back to school.
“The dress code at the school was specifically created as another means of targeting and harassing our Black children,” Wood said.
But, it's just one reason why the group must encourage Black mothers to attend school board meetings and request study sessions be conducted publicly to address the disproportionate disciplinary practices with respect to Black children, Wood said.
“When we show up in large numbers to address an issue we have seen positive results,” Wood said. “We have found that in order to dismantle the school to prison pipeline it starts with us focusing in on ensuring our children are in safe and supportive learning environments and that means we need to address the punitive disciplinary actions administered by implicitly biased school administers and teachers.”
Wood continued: “We strongly believe that, as parents, we have the power to change the current school system when we collectively communicate the same message.”
According to Wood, that message is simple:
“We, as Black mothers, will no longer remain silent while our children are blatantly disrespected, threatened, harassed, intimidated, provoked, neglected and set up to fail through policies, disciplinary practices, curriculum, regulations and/or laws deeply rooted in racial stereotypes.”

Islamabad-The Islamabad High Court Monday maintained its order of suspending the operation of an FIR registered against Deputy Chairman National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Muhammad Imtiaz Tajwar on corruption charges against him.
A single bench of IHC comprising Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui conducted hearing of the petition moved by the deputy chairman NAB against registration of FIR against him on charges of corruption and misuse of authority during his appointment as Chairman NADRA and issue aforementioned directions in this matter. However, no court proceedings could be occurred as it was informed the court that petitioner's counsel Shah Khawar Advocate could not appear before it due to his engagements in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
Therefore, the court maintained its previous orders of suspending the operation of the FIR and deferred the hearing till April 20 for further proceedings in this matter.
Previously, Shah Khawar had contended before the court that his client is a grade 22 officers and in case, if there were corruption allegations against a grade 22 officers, only federal anti-corruption council can initiate proceedings and FIA is not authorised to take action in this matter.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Tajwar on charges of corruption as well as misuse of authority when he was performing his duties as Chairman National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA). In this connection, the investigation authority has registered FIR against him under sections 409, 109 of Pakistan Penal Code and r/w 5(2)47 prevention of corruption act (PCA) at FIA corporate crime circle police station.
The deputy chairman NAB moved the petition through his counsel Shah Khawar Advocate and nominated Interior Secretary, Director General (DG) Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Director General, Deputy Director and Assistant Director FIA as respondents. In his petition, he stated that FIA registered this FIR against him and two others without any complaint from NADRA or anyone else. He contended that FIR was lodged against him for an occurrence of 2014/15 and inquiry was initiated in September 2016. At relevant time, petitioner was serving as additional secretary Ministry of Interior and in January 2014 he was given additional charge of Chairman NADRA till appointment of a regular Chairman. Petitioner kept serving as Chairman NADRA till February 6, 2015.
Tajwar argued that under rule 5 of the FIA inquiries and investigation rules 2002, FIA could not have initiated an inquiry against him without prior approval of NADRA.
He added that allegations against him for criminal breach of trust were baseless. He maintained that his entire career is unblemished and inquiry has been initiated against him on the whims and wishes of high-ups sitting in the Ministry of Interior. The deputy chairman NAB maintained that after receiving a questionnaire from an Assistant Director FIA, petitioner responded the same and has been requesting the respondents to allow him an opportunity to confront with the record that was not available with the petitioner.
He said that denying petitioner's access to the record is depriving his access to the fair trial. He informed the court that during his tenure as Chairman NADRA, the registration authority earned a record profit of Rs3.8 billion. The petitioner continued that he also did not draw a salary as Chairman NADRA and it was during his tenure that complete audit of the authority was done. The audit report was submitted after petitioner left the charge and not a single para in the audit report pointed an irregularity towards him. He adopted that he is being politically victimised. Therefore, he prayed to the court to declare initiation of inquiry and registration of FIR as mala fide and unlawful and the same may be quashed.

Chris Paul and new Houston Rockets team-mate James Harden
We already knew who will play on Christmas Day, but now we know the rest of the 2017-18 NBA schedule.
The season begins with the Boston Celtics taking on the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Houston Rockets — with new guard Chris Paul — traveling to reigning NBA champions the Golden State Warriors on October 17.
Following opening night, the Philadelphia 76ers face the Washington Wizards, while the Minnesota Timberwolves play the San Antonio Spurs on October 18.
The 76ers, complete with the last three top picks in the NBA Draft, will play in nationally televised games 14 times this season, including a November 15 game against the Los Angeles Lakers and number two overall pick Lonzo Ball.
One aspect of this season's schedule is more rest worked into the calendar.
While the first week of the NBA schedule was announced last week, along with the five Christmas games — the 76ers at the New York Knicks, the Cavaliers at the Warriors, the Wizards at the Celtics, the Rockets at Oklahoma City Thunder, and the Timberwolves at the Lakers — the rest of the schedule features several cannot-miss playoff rematches.
With many new faces in new places, here are 10 games you do not want to miss for the 2017-18 NBA season.
1. October 26: New Orleans Pelicans at Sacramento Kings — Former Sacramento centre DeMarcus Cousins gets to face his former team at his old home.
2. October 29: New York Knicks at Cleveland Cavaliers — Will Carmelo Anthony and Kyrie Irving still be with the Knicks and Cavs at this point? That remains to be seen. The two are both rumoured to be traded eventually, possibly for each other. Also, the Knicks will close the season at Cleveland on April 11.
3. December 9: Miami Heat vs. Brooklyn Nets — Hassan Whiteside and the Heat will face the Nets and new guard D'Angelo Russell in Mexico City in the second of two games for Brooklyn south of the border. The Nets will play the Warriors on December 7.
4. December 13: Oklahoma City Thunder at Indiana Pacers — All-Star Paul George returns to Indiana to face his former team.
5. January 11: Philadelphia 76ers vs. Boston Celtics — The long-time Eastern Conference rivals will head to London as the NBA placed a regular-season game in England's capital for just the eighth time.
6. January 15: Golden State Warriors at Cleveland Cavaliers — After facing off on Christmas, the second matchup between the Warriors and the Cavs will be the marquee game on Martin Luther King Day.
7. January 20: Golden State Warriors at Houston Rockets — The revamped Rockets will test themselves against the champs as the Warriors complete a five-game road trip.
8. February 9: Minnesota Timberwolves at Chicago Bulls — All-Star guard Jimmy Butler will make his first trip to Chicago since he was traded to the Timberwolves.
9. March 28: Boston Celtics at Utah Jazz — Gordon Hayward will head back to Salt Lake City for the first time since the coveted free agent reunited with former college coach Brad Stevens in Boston.
10. April 3: Boston Celtics at Milwaukee Bucks — The Bucks hope to be in a position to play spoiler to the Celtics and the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference and a late-season matchup with Boston could be key for seeding.
Association Urges Public Officials at All Levels to Increase Support for craftworker Training Programs to Address Chronic Worker Shortage Amid Strong Demand for Both Residential, Nonresidential Construction
Construction employment increased by 36,000 jobs in January to the highest level since November 2008 as employers increased pay in an effort to address a chronic worker shortage, according to an analysis of new government data by the Associated General Contractors of America. The association urged public officials to strengthen training and education programs to prepare more workers for careers in the high-paying construction field.
“This report aligns with what contractors have been telling the association—that the construction industry is still eager to add workers,” said Ken Simonson, the association's chief economist. “The employment gains would be even larger if there were enough workers with the right skills available to hire.”
Construction employment totaled 6,809,000 in January, an increase of 36,000 from the upwardly revised December total and an increase of 170,000 or 2.6 percent from a year ago. Average hourly earnings in construction increased 3.2 percent over the past year to $28.52 per hour. Hourly earnings in construction are rising faster than the 2.5 percent increase for all private sector workers and are now nearly 10 percent higher than the private sector average of $26.00 per hour, Simonson noted.
In a survey that the association released in January, 73 percent of the 1,281 participating contractors said they planned to add to their headcount in 2017. But an equally high percentage said they were having trouble filling hourly or salaried positions. End-of-month openings in construction have been at 17-year highs, according to recent government data, Simonson added.

Residential construction—comprising residential building and specialty trade contractors—added 20,300 jobs in January and 128,200, or 5.0 percent, compared to a year ago. Nonresidential construction (building, specialty trades, and heavy and civil engineering construction) employment increased by 14,900 employees in January and 41,600 employees, or 1.0 percent, over 12 months.
Association officials noted that both their survey and government data released earlier this week point to continued growth in construction activity and an eagerness by contractors to hire—if they can find qualified workers. The association urged lawmakers and government officials to expand and fund employment and training programs to equip students and workers with the skills needed to become productive construction employees.
“Contractors have the ‘help wanted' signs out and are offering good pay and benefits,” said Stephen E. Sandherr, the association's chief executive officer. “We need government at all levels to revitalize and better fund programs to educate and train the next generation of construction craftworkers.”

Showbiz scion, fashion model and in-demand actress Riley Keough, the eldest grandchild of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, soon to be seen in the upcoming Lars von Trier thriller “The House That Jack Built,” has set down some real estate roots, so swears always reliable real estate snitch Yolanda Yakketyyak. Keough and Australian stuntman husband Ben Smith-Peterson recently paid slightly more than $1.3 million for a renovated two-bedroom and two-bathroom 1920s Tudor cottage near L.A.'s trendy Silver Lake.
Hidden behind wispy trees, a vine-encrusted fence and tall, visually impenetrable hedgerow, the not quite 1,200-square-foot bungalow marries original architectural elements with modern-day amenities such as central heat and air conditioning. A courtyard entrance and itty-bitty vestibule lead to a living room with built-in window seat and a separate dining area open over a raised snack bar to a renovated kitchen with butcher-block countertops. The master bedroom has two small closets and a private bathroom.
The attic has been converted to a bonus room with steeply pitched cathedral ceilings and a variety of built-ins that include a window seat and a day bed. Both bedrooms have French doors to a half-moon shaped deck that overlooks a professionally landscaped and picturesque, tree-shaded yard composed of a verdant patch of lawn and several gravel-paved patios for lounging and al fresco dining.
Keough, who's appeared in the Steven Soderbergh films “Magic Mike” and “Logan Lucky” along with the first season of the Soderbergh-produced TV series “The Girlfriend Experience,” for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination, grew up in the guard-gated and heavily celebrified Hidden Hills enclave in L.A.'s far western suburbs in on a multi-acre estate her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, sold in 2010 for $5 million. That estate is now owned by Kanye West and Kim Kardashian-West, who bought it in 2014 for almost $20 million.

It's a situation any parent would hope their child never encounters, coming face to face with a kidnapper. As terrifying as the thought is, according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, at least 2 AMBER Alerts were issued last year for children in Alabama.
The Dothan Police Department is offering a free abduction prevention class for children,
"It's called Kid Escape," said Corporal Susie Peters. "It picks up where Stranger Danger leaves off. We still go over the importance of not talking to strangers and don't leave anywhere without an adult you're familiar with. We also go into some physical things to protect themselves from an abduction attempt."
"It's not to teach them how to out strength an attacker, it's actually teaching them how to outwit their attacker by using their body positioning," said Lieutenant Rachel David.
Typically an abduction happens in seconds.
"It's about 10 to 30 seconds," Peters said. "They're going to look around, have their vehicle positioned in a certain spot, walk up, grab, and go."
The techniques taught in the class help ensure the child isn't an easy target and isn't easily taken. The main technique is the "grip, dip, and spin," where a child d rops low to the ground, grabs hold of the attacker's legs to make it more difficult for them be picked up and carried away. Peters says the technique works for multiple scenarios.
"If they're coming at you from the front and grab your arm, get you in the headlock, throw you over their shoulder," she said.
In addition to the physical techniques, they also teach children how to bring attention to themselves.
"We teach them to yell and not scream. That sounds like kids playing," said Peters.
"In law enforcement we study those people who are able to overcome an attack. Often times, it's the mentality and pre-planning for how to handle a situation is the only differing factor," said David.
Peter's son, Austin Bennett, has gone through the course and says it's given him confidence.
"I can defend myself and get away," he said.
At least 50 people have already signed up for the class. Parents who registered say it's important to ensure their child is safe even when they're not around,
"I feel I'm doing the best of my ability to protect her. I know that if she has this set of skills, she'll be able to defend herself," said one mother, Ally Gulledge.
The course is next Saturday at Wiregrass Park and Recreation Center at 10 a.m. It's offered to children 5 to 11 years old. For more information call 334-793-0230 or email speters@dothan.org.

The president would like to see those who don't stand for the anthem fired from their lucrative jobs. He even called their mothers a word referring to female dogs.
It amazes me that someone silently genuflecting during the national anthem can cause such a stir when to genuflect in a church is a sign of respect. Their silent protest speaks volumes.
Unfortunately, what's being heard has nothing to do with the reason for their 'taking a knee.' A protest against racial inequality and police brutality has turned into a debate about whether people should be forced to be respectful or face retribution.
That's what North Korea does. Why would we want it here?
Comments abound about not respecting the veterans who fought to guarantee the freedoms we enjoy. Those comments somehow seem to forget that one of the most precious freedoms that many have died to preserve is the right for Americans to protest their own government without fear of retaliation.
So it's time for the NFL players to stand up. It's time for their silent protest to end.
It's time to silence those who would silence them. It's time to focus on the meaning of their protest and silence those who skew its intent. It's time for them to stand up and speak up and let their message be heard.

PanARMENIAN.Net - Canon introduced three new cameras on Tuesday, February 14 that will go on sale in April: the $749 entry-level Rebel T7i; the $899 prosumer-focused 77D; and a new $779 mirrorless camera, the M6. And while they appear to be very capable still cameras, they are also each missing a key feature that videographers have been clamoring for from Canon: the ability to shoot in 4K, The Verge reports.
Not everyone needs to shoot in 4K. But in the video world, it's becoming more important. Shooting at 4K resolution now helps people future-proof their video projects, which is a smart thing to do since an increasing number of monitors (and even some phones) have 4K or near-4K-resolution screens. Shooting in 4K is also a creative tool if you know that the video will only be shown in 1080p — that extra resolution can be used to create different crops, or even zoom and pan in post-production.
If you prefer Canon but you want a camera that can shoot 4K, your only options are the $3,499 EOS 5D Mark IV, the $4,999 EOS 1D C, the $5,999 EOS 1DX Mark II, or one of Canon's cinema cameras. That 4K is absent from any reasonably affordable Canon DSLR is conspicuous because it was a Canon camera that led the charge into DSLR videography in the first place. The 5D Mark II, which was released at the end of 2008, wasn't the very first DSLR capable of DSLR. But its full HD video was so much better than what Nikon offered at the time that it helped spark a revolution.
Now, if you can live without 4K, Canon's new cameras do have a lot to offer. Despite its embrace of video over the last decade, Canon has kept its DSLR and mirrorless cameras primarily focused on stills, and these models — especially the T7i and the M6 — significantly extend those capabilities. All three are equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC, and they all make it easy to just pick up and shoot.
The pilot behind the popular Ice Patrol blog that provides a bird's eye view of the lake's spring thaw, has just released his first science fiction novel.
Avians, published by Tim Armstrong under the pen name Timothy Gwyn, follows the story of a girl in a different world who flies gliders as an escape from an arranged marriage.
“The flying I do is very dependent on metal, fossil fuels and men, and this is entirely different,” Gwyn said. “Raisa [the protagonist] is a 14-year-old girl, and she basically runs away from home because she doesn't like her family situation. The flying she does is quite dangerous, but also very necessary.”
Gwyn said he grew up as an “indiscriminate reader” of science fiction and started writing it himself here and there when he was in Grade 7.
“It was always there in the back of my mind that it would be fun to do, and I just gobbled up everything,” he said.
The main appeal for writing in the genre is because it has a flexibility in talking about topics that would be harder to broach in an everyday world, The reason Raisa runs away and joins a flight group that resembles the French Foreign Legion is because her landowner family wants to set her up in a marriage in order to consolidate family power, Gwyn explained. “She's not happy about it.”
When he was originally pitching the book to publishers and getting rejections, Gwyn said he happened to run into Robert Runté, who lectures on science fiction at the University of Lethbridge and is a senior editor at Five Rivers Publishing, at CanCon in Ottawa.
Rather than looking for Canadian content, Runté said he was looking for stories with a “Canadian mindset”, even if it's found in another universe.
“He said American science fiction ends in victory and British science fiction ends in defeat,” Gwyn said.
Whereas in Canadian science fiction, “we know we can make a difference, but we don't expect to change the world. We try to accomplish something worthwhile.”
Without giving away the book's ending, Gwyn said the protagonist Raisa achieves a degree of freedom beyond her expectations, but her problems don't disappear.
Avians are released on Aug. 1, and Gwyn travelled to Calgary this past weekend for the official book launch at the When Words Collide literary convention, where he also took part in panels and presentations.
The local book launch will take place at the Kenora Public Library on Tuesday, Aug. 15 at 2 p.m. Copies are available at Elizabeth Campbell Books.

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. -- Purdue coach Matt Painter said he does not expect starting center Isaac Haas to play again this season -- even if the NCAA approves a brace to protect his fractured right elbow.
The 7-foot-2 senior was injured during an NCAA tournament win over Cal State Fullerton. Team trainers fitted Haas with a large brace to protect his arm and he worked out with his teammates Saturday, but that brace would not have been allowed in a game for safety reasons.
Painter also says Haas also has yet to demonstrate he can grab two-handed rebounds and shoot free throws with his right hand.
Second-seeded Purdue beat Butler without Haas to reach its second straight Sweet 16. The Boilermakers play Texas Tech on Friday in Boston.
ISLAMABAD, June 15 (APP): Pakistan believes that Afghan-owned and
Afghan-led political settlement is imperative for restoring long-lasting peace in the war-torn country.
The Foreign Office Spokesperson, Nafees Zakaria during the weekly
press briefing here Thursday said Pakistan was keen to see durable and lasting peace in Afghanistan.
While rejecting the military solution to Afghan conflict, he said the
country has been in war like situation for the last 40 years, adding that Pakistan has suffered tremendously due to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.
“Pakistan would benefit more from peaceful Afghanistan than any other
country, however, the blame game of Afghanistan would not serve any purpose.”
Replying to a question, the spokesperson said the longstanding
conflicts in Afghanistan have given space to non-state actors.
He said the growing presence of Daesh terrorist group was an issue of
grave concern for many regional countries, which is also a major threat to the Afghan peace process.
China and Pakistan are making concerted efforts for restoring peace in
Afghanistan, he added.
He said once peace returns to Afghanistan, the displaced Afghani people
will go back to their home-country for living there in a peaceful environment.
He, however, said the internal weaknesses of Afghanistan should not
be blamed on others.
Regarding the sideline meeting of Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif
and the Russian President Vladimir Putin during the SCO summit, the spokesperson said an immense potential exists in the field of education, culture, trade, and defense for further boosting the bilateral relations between the two countries.
He said, “We welcome Vladimir Putin's visit to Pakistan.”
The spokesperson said the Indian occupation forces in Indian
occupied Kashmir (IoK) while showing complete disrespect to the holy month of Ramazan, martyred more than 25 Kashmiris, including children and injured over 200, mostly students, using pellet guns.
He said hundreds of children have been blinded
– completely or partially – during this past year alone.
He said Pakistan's offer to get their eyes treated in any country
in Europe still holds, adding “We have broached this issue with UN HR officials in Geneva.”
Pakistan has also effectively taken up violations of Kashmiris' rights
and Indian atrocities in IoK at the ongoing 35th session of Human Rights Council in Geneva, he added.
Nafees Zakaria said, “As we speak today, Indian occupation forces may be
brutally beating up Kashmiris for celebrating Pakistan cricket team's win in semi-final as they did when Pakistan won on 12 June at Cardiff.”
He said the occupation forces broke into shops and looted goods to
punish Kashmiris for celebrating Pakistan's victory.
Yasiel Puig connects on a two-run homer in the second inning to open the scoring for the Dodgers, and on his way back to the dugout, he directs his middle fingers toward fans sitting near home plate. (0:22)
CLEVELAND -- Los Angeles Dodgers Yasiel Puig has been suspended one game and fined by Major League Baseball for making an obscene gesture to Indians fans on Tuesday night.
Puig flashed the middle finger on both hands at fans sitting behind home plate at Progressive Field after hitting a home run in the second inning. Baseball executive Joe Torre announced the one-game penalty and undisclosed fine.
Puig is appealing the decision and will play Wednesday night. The mercurial player said he "stooped" to the level of fans who he said were heckling him in the on-deck circle. Puig said that the group of fans kept talking to him after the home run.
The suspension is the latest incident involving Puig, who has tried the Dodgers' patience with previous behavior.
Puig got two hits in the Dodgers' 7-5 win over the Indians.
ISLAMABAD, Oct 6 (APP): Minister for Interior and Planning,
Development and Reform, Ahsan Iqbal on Friday urged for ensuring tangible outcomes of Pak-China industrial cooperation.
Chairing a meeting to review progress on Special Economic
Zones (SEZs), Minister Ahsan Iqbal directed all stakeholders to fast track the development of SEZs, complete land acquisition process and feasibilities.
He instructed the line ministries and provincial governments
to ensure concrete measures for provision of electricity, gas and other facilities to these SEZs.
“We need to transform these SEZs into an attractive
destination for foreign investment”, said Ahsan Iqbal, instructing
provinces to finalize their incentives plan for SEZs, in addition to
the incentives already announced by the federal government.
The zone authorities should create a competitive environment
for making this cooperation, a truly successful one, said Ahsan
Iqbal, emphasizing further to develop these zones on the basis of
feasibly studies and locally available resources.
Ahsan Iqbal said that a model and smart industrial park be
developed in Islamabad Capital Territory with consultation of
Islamabad and Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce.
The minister instructed the provinces to opt for best and
feasible financing model, ensuring maximum benefits from relocation
of labor intensive industries from China to Asia and subsequent
recreation of 85 million jobs.
Ahsan Iqbal underlined need of vibrant Board of Investment and
asked the officials of BOI to prepare reform package in accordance
with prevailing needs and circumstances.
During the meeting, BOI officials briefed the participants
regarding the visit of Chinese SEZs experts' group, scheduled in the
second week of October.
The experts would conduct training workshops besides holding
meeting with Pakistan's experts on industrial development sector.
Ahsan Iqbal instructed that all efforts be made to conduct
meaningful workshops and meetings during the visit of Chinese Expert
Group.
He issued instruction to undertake determined efforts
regarding industrial cooperation for bringing out tangible outcomes
prior to 7th JCC Meeting.
The meeting was attended by senior officials form line
ministries and provincial governments. On this occasion, the
provincial authorities briefed the meeting about their respective
SEZs.
The relationship between time and us here at SFU is gorgeously complex. We beg for more of it, demand the impossible from it, and curse the concept of it. Making deadlines, outings, and self-care fit together is like assembling a puzzle with no clue how the final product should look.
It feels nice, then, to believe that time's secretly got our backs, injecting magic into particular dates and hours for us. It's hardly surprising that we're so hung up on waiting for the exact turn of the year to turn over new leaves.
I'm not really in love with the concept of New Year's Eve. Oh, it had its charm when I was younger, but it doesn't feel special anymore. I've made so many resolutions growing up, and it's only now that I'm realizing that I just don't have it in me.
I hate New Year's resolutions; let me tell you why.
I hate the lead-up. Reminding myself of every mistake I've made, compiling an ugly itinerary of every flaw I've yet to fix about myself — and yes, doing so and learning from your mistakes is important, but why do it on any schedule besides my own?
I hate the parties, because they feel false and forced. What are we celebrating? A new calendar? Why? What was so special about the year before? The year after? Is it just that we've survived this long? Congratulations!
I hate the follow-up. Checking in with myself, falling short of my ambitious hopes every time and knowing that if I didn't have it in me to change in 2016, it will take more than 2017 to fix that.
See, I've spent more years than I care to count being told that I don't ‘fit'. I stretch out the ends of my sentences like rubber and run through the rest at double-speed, all in a voice that doesn't fit my appearance. I smile too much; I don't smile enough; I am too abrasive or too passive. Paper-thin first, too heavy later, and I wear the wrong things in the wrong temperatures.
This time of year, I'm constantly asked what my resolutions are, and therefore, constantly reminded of the traits that have stayed with me for nearly two decades — some of which I'd like to change and some of which I'm sick of being criticized for.
There's magic in accepting superstitions, but as much as I love magic, it's never helped me get in shape, or be a happier person, or help my crush to get a clue. Letting myself believe that there's anything special about January 1 gives me nothing but disappointment. I choose not to.
I don't get caught up in the traditions that don't ring true for me anymore, and that doesn't stop at New Years. Tradition has sort of broken me in more ways than I care to count, and if that's true for you too, then I'm telling you that things don't have to be that way. Figure yourself out at your own pace.
You aren't wrong for doing or thinking differently from friends and family. Celebrate what you want; place value on what matters to you, not on what you're told to. Don't fret because you've changed too much or not enough, and don't worry about making resolutions just because that's the common thing.
As you read this, 2016's been over for a while. I'm probably on a bus somewhere with no promises carried over from the year before, sipping my tea, and thinking of nothing much at all.

Could Probiotics Protect Kids From A Downside Of Antibiotics?
Enlarge this image toggle caption Rob Stein/NPR Rob Stein/NPR
It's a typical hectic morning at Michele Comisky's house in Vienna, Va., when she gets a knock on her front door.
"Hi, how are you?" Comisky says as she greets Keisha Herbin Smith, a research assistant at Georgetown University. "Come on in."
Comisky, 39, leads Herbin Smith into her kitchen.
"Which one isn't feeling good?" asks Herbin Smith, glancing at Comisky's children. "That one," Comisky says, pointing to her 8-year-old son, Jackson.
Jackson has an ear infection. So he just started 10 days of antibiotics to kill the strain of bacteria that's giving him an earache. That's why Herbin Smith's here.
"What time did he take his antibiotic?" Herbin Smith asks.
He asks because the antibiotics won't just wipe out the bad bacteria. They could also disrupt the good bacteria in Jackson's body, which can lead to stomach problems, including severe diarrhea.
Herbin Smith had rushed to Comisky's house to deliver a special yogurt drink that scientists are testing in hopes of preventing those serious problems.
"We want him to take the first yogurt within 24 hours of taking his first antibiotic," she says.
The yogurt contains a probiotic — a living strain of bacteria that researchers think could help prevent diarrhea and other complications of the antibiotic.
Some previous research has hinted that probiotics could help, and some doctors already are recommending probiotics to parents of children taking antibiotics.
But researchers hope the new yogurt study will provide clearer evidence as to whether that's a good idea. It's the first large, carefully designed test of a probiotic to get reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, says Dr. Daniel Merenstein, who is leading the study. He's the director of research programs in the department of family medicine at Georgetown University.
"The problem with a lot of probiotic research is that they haven't always been the best of studies," Merenstein says. "Many are done by industry. Many were done in other countries. We're looking to see if it actually prevents diarrhea in kids."
Merenstein's study is part of an explosion of interest in research on the microbiome — the billions of friendly bacteria, yeast and other microorganisms that live in the human body. There's mounting evidence these microbes play important roles in human health.

In addition to helping prevent diarrhea in children taking antibiotics, there is some evidence that probiotics could help prevent complications from antibiotics in adults as well, and might help prevent gastrointestinal infections that sometimes occur when people travel to other countries. Other people have suggested probiotics might help treat vaginal infections in women, or possibly alleviate colic in infants or perhaps prevent eczema in some babies. Probiotics are also being looked at as a possibility to prevent a serious condition in newborn babies — necrotizing enterocolitis.
Some researchers even argue there's enough evidence to recommend that healthy adults take a probiotic regularly to help maintain their health.
"I think there's a generic benefit in ingesting high numbers of safe, live bacteria every day," says Colin Hill, a professor of microbiology at University College Cork in Ireland. "If I had my way, there would be a recommended daily allowance of bacteria."
But many scientists question whether there's enough evidence to support that suggestion or the many claims some companies are making about the alleged benefits probiotics. Some products are being promoted to help prevent obesity, heart disease and even alleviate mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression.
NPR/ YouTube
"The marketing of every claim under the sun with every product under the sun is definitely questionable," says Linda Duffy, a program director at the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. "There's not much in the way a magic bullet anywhere."
The net benefit of probiotic use with certain conditions "is looking very, very promising," she says. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions.
While probiotics are probably safe for most otherwise healthy people, Duffy and others note that the products could pose some risk for people with weakened immune systems, such as those infected with the AIDS virus or for people undergoing cancer chemotherapy.
Another caution is that probiotics are not regulated as closely as prescription and over-the-counter medications. So there's no guarantee that what's on the label is actually in the bottle — or that whatever organisms were originally in the bottle are still alive. There are also concerns about potentially dangerous contaminants in products that could pose a risk even to healthy people.
"Are there contaminants out there? Are there adulterated products? Are there marketed products without the appropriate claims? Absolutely," Duffy says. "Like anything, you have to be a wise consumer."
For his part, Merenstein hopes his study will provide strong new evidence that probiotics provide benefits for children taking antibiotics.
In the study, 300 children will drink specially made strawberry yogurt. Half will drink yogurt that contains a probiotic called bifidobacterium. The researchers will then compare the incidence of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems in the two groups of kids.
In addition, the researchers are gathering fecal samples from the children to try to determine exactly how probiotics might work.
"One of our goals is to show that taking a probiotic will get your microbiome back to what it was before you started the antibiotic — and/or protect you from the changes," Merenstein says.
So, back at Comisky's house, Jackson takes his first gulp of Merenstein's special yogurt.
"All right, here you go — you can drink it right out of here," Comisky says as she takes a bottle out of the refrigerator, opens the cap and hands it to her son.
"Is it good?" she asks.
"Yeah," says Jackson, as he gulps down the yogurt and declares: "Done!"
It will take years for Merenstein's team to gather and analyze the results of the study. So it will be a while before they can say for sure whether this particular probiotic treatment works or not.
MAZAR-I-SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - At least one person was killed and nine were wounded in the Afghan province of Faryab on Wednesday during a protest that underlined the tension between powerful regional leaders and President Ashraf Ghani ahead of elections due in October.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Maiman, the capital of the northern province of Faryab, to demand the release of a prominent militia commander close to General Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ethnic Uzbek vice president who is in exile in Turkey.
The commander, area police chief Nizamuddin Qaisari, was arrested after a violent dispute during a meeting with leaders of government security forces on Monday, drawing angry protests from Dostum's supporters.
The dispute has highlighted fragile security in Faryab, where Islamic State fighters have gained a foothold, battling militia commanders loosely affiliated with the government.
Dostum, in exile in Turkey after accusations that he ordered a political opponent to be tortured and sexually assaulted, issued a statement calling for the release of Qaisari and warning that the province, on the border with Turkmenistan, could collapse in chaos.
The protest descended into violence when protesters tried to force their way into governor's compound and security forces fired in the air to stop them, said Karim Yourish, spokesman for the provincial police.
But the head of a provincial council, Mohammad Tahir Rahmani, said at least one person was killed and eight wounded in the firing, which then prompting the crowd to break into the compound.
“We were trying to control the protesters and have a peaceful protest, but unfortunately it turned violent after security forces opened fire,” Rahmani said, adding that one member of the provincial council was among the injured.
The trouble underlines the important role that Dostum plays in politics despite the international outrage that prompted his departure from Afghanistan last year.
Since his exile, there have been regular reports that he will return to Afghanistan, where he commands loyalty among ethnic Uzbeks who make up a significant minority in the north of the country.
With parliamentary elections due in October and presidential elections due early next year, there has been growing tension between powerful regional leaders, like Dostum, and Ghani's Western-backed government in Kabul.
This week, Atta Mohammad Noor, the former governor of Balkh province, who stepped down in March after a months-long standoff with the central government, announced a new opposition movement called the Grand National Coalition of Afghanistan.
Noor, a leader of a party supported mostly by ethnic Tajiks, is associated with both Dostum and Mohammad Mohaqiq, a leader of the Hazara minority. He has insisted that the coalition be involved in overseeing the elections.
The political tension is a distraction for the central government as it battles the Taliban insurgency and a growing threat from Islamic State.

Mpumalanga will play a bigger role than mere kingmaker at the ANC's December conference as newly-released figures reveal that the province – which was the fifth biggest in 2012 – has massively grown and officially overtaken the Eastern Cape as the ANC's second biggest stronghold. The embattled Western Cape has now officially shrunk to become the smallest. By CARIEN DU PLESSIS.
ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe has on Friday sent a letter to provincial secretaries confirming the number of branch delegates from each province to the party's national conference in December. KwaZulu-Natal remains the biggest province with 870, but its lead over the second province is much smaller than it was in 2012, when it had almost 300 delegates more.
In December, KZN will have only 134 more delegates than the second largest province, Mpumalanga (736), indicating that the conference would not be an automatic walk-over for the candidate with the most support in KwaZulu-Natal as it was in 2012. Growth in delegates from the “Premier League” provinces (North West and Free State) could, however, make up for this drop if they decide to form a voting bloc with KwaZulu-Natal.
It was previously thought that Mpumalanga would play the role of tipping the balance of forces either towards KwaZulu-Natal, where the current leadership supports former African Union Commission chairperson and ANC MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to become president, or towards the Eastern Cape, where Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has the most support. But figures now show Mpumalanga could be a player in its own right.
Mpumalanga Premier DD Mabuza has previously stood by the “Premier League” which supported Dlamini Zuma, but he has since come out strongly in favour of a third way in support of ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, who has portrayed himself as a “unity candidate”.
While some say Mpumalanga, the only province to also have grown its ANC electoral support, is united solid behind Mabuza's leadership, others say State Security Minister David Mahlobo has been doing a lot of canvassing in the province on behalf of Dlamini-Zuma.
Mahlobo is considered to be one of President Jacob Zuma's loyal confidantes.
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa's home province of Limpopo, which had the third largest number of delegates in 2012, has fallen to fourth place, with 643 delegates to the conference. Limpopo's leadership has been in support of Ramaphosa, although at least two regions have elected leadership in support of Dlamini-Zuma.
North West has also shown massive growth since 2012, more than doubling its number of delegates to 538.
Gauteng, which supports Ramaphosa, comes in just after North West with 508 delegates, while the Free State has been allocated 409 delegates – slightly more than in 2012.
The divided Western Cape is for the first time at the bottom of the list with 182 delegates, following the Ramaphosa-supporting Northern Cape, with 197.
A total of 4723 branch delegates will attend conference, forming 90% of the total. The other 10% - 525 delegates – will be made up of the 86 national executive committee members and top six officials, the provincial executive committees and the leagues, including the ANC Women's League, the ANC Youth League and the ANC Veterans' League.
Branch delegates for December 2017:
KwaZulu-Natal: 870
Mpumalanga: 736
Eastern Cape: 648
Limpopo: 643
North West: 538
Gauteng: 508
Free State: 409
Northern Cape: 197
Western Cape: 182
Total branch delegates: 4723 (90% of the total)
Leagues and PECs: an estimated 525
Total delegates: an estimated 5248
Branch delegates at Mangaung conference in 2012:
KwaZulu-Natal: 974
Eastern Cape: 676
Limpopo: 574
Gauteng: 500
Mpumalanga: 467
Free State: 324
North West: 234
Western Cape: 178
Northern Cape: 176
Total with PECs and leagues: 4500

Who's on the undercard?
British fans will not be too familiar with the names on the undercard, though one to watch out for will be German super middleweight prospect Stefan Haertel, who takes on Viktor Polyakov aiming to maintain his perfect record and move to 15-0.
Sauerland-promoted Zach Parker is in action against Matingu Kindele with the Brit aiming to move to 14-0 and move closer to fighting some of the box office names in the 168-pound division in the UK.

The Kansas Geological Survey reported new oil production numbers for the state Tuesday. Operators produced 3.08 million barrels in August. The total for the first eight months of the year is 24.151 million barrels of crude from 50,901 active wells.
Ellis County led the state with 230,000 barrels of new production for a total through August of 1.77 million barrels. Barton County reported 150,000 barrels in August for total production of 1.14 million barrels through August. Russell County 135,000 barrels for the month, with the running total reaching 1.07 million. And in Stafford County, producers added 90,000 barrels for a total through August of just over 700,000 barrels.
Here are the ten top oil-producing counties in Kansas through August (KGS):
Ellis 1.77 million barrels
Haskell 1.61 million barrels
Barton 1.14 million barrels
Finney 1.08 million barrels
Rooks 1.077 million barrels
Russell 1.072 million barrels
Ness 1.004 million barrels
Harper 706 thousand barrels
Stafford 700 thousand barrels
Barber 649 thousand barrels
Independent Oil & Gas Service reported 11 active drilling rigs in eastern Kansas last week, down two from the week before, and 25 west of Wichita, which is up three. Drilling was underway at one lease in Ellis County. Operators report drilling ahead at sites in Ellis and Russell County. They're moving in completion tools at three sites in Barton County, two in Ellis County, one in Russell County and two in Stafford County. Baker Hughes reported 931 active drilling rigs coast-to-coast, an increase of two oil rigs. Canada reported 219 active rigs, down three.
Kansas operators filed 35 permits for drilling at new locations across the state last week, 1,359 so far this year. There are 18 new drilling permits east of Wichita, 17 in western Kansas, including one new permit in Barton County.
Independent Oil & Gas Service reports 33 new well completions for the week, 1,243 so far this year. There were 22 wells completed in eastern Kansas and eleven west of Wichita, including two in Stafford County.
The Trump administration imposed two-year delay in implementation of an Obama-era rule intended to curb methane emissions from drilling on public lands. The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management is taking action to delay the rule, according to a filing in the Federal Register. The rules have been the subject of court fights and a failed vote in the Senate to repeal them.
The government's lease offering of 900 tracts in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska drew bids on just seven of those tracts. The bids Wednesday totaled $1.16 million. All of the bids were submitted jointly by subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips and Anadarko.
US Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner Bart Chilton and his team on Monday announced the creation of the first digital currency based on a physical asset. OilCoin will tokenize barrels of oil held in reserve with each token representing the value of one barrel. A public token sale is scheduled early next year. Commissioner Chilton says OilCoin is a regulated digital currency based upon “something real that folks can touch and feel,” which could provide a safe haven from the volatility associated with cryptocurrency.
The vice-chairman of China's securities regulator says they're near “the starting point for the comprehensive opening of China's futures markets to the world,” beginning with the imminent launch of crude oil futures. According to Reuters, he did not elaborate on when the Chinese crude futures would start trading.
Chevron announced it would cut its total capital and exploratory budget for a fourth consecutive year in 2018. But the supermajor is significantly boosting spending on U.S. shale, especially in the Permian Basin of Texas. The company will drop 3.3 billion for Permian production and another one billion for other shale investments, compared to $2.5 billion this year.
Government finances in New Mexico have turned around, after two years of drastic cuts, to the point that lawmakers can now expect revenues to exceed spending by $199 million, or about 3.3%. The rebounding oil patch in New Mexico gets credit for much of that. In a report to legislators, officials said income from oil and natural gas was adjusted upward by $140 million for the current and coming fiscal years. Income tax projections were also higher.
A North Dakota trucking firm learned the hard way that it can be fined by both the health department and oil and gas regulators for dumping oilfield wastewater. The company, Black Hills Trucking lost its bid to reject nearly a million dollars in civil penalties assessed by that state's Oil and Gas Division. Black Hills argued before the state Supreme Court that jurisdiction in the case belongs solely to the Health Department, because the dumping incidents occurred on a road and not on a well pad. The Health Department has already issued a civil penalty. The high court ruling Thursday affirms the Oil and Gas Division's additional $950,000 fine plus costs.
North Dakota health officials have concluded that a proposed oil refinery close to the Theodore Roosevelt National Park should comply with federal and state air pollution rules. The company still needs a state water permit as well. Operators were able to skirt the normal site-selection process because at up to 49,500 barrels, the proposal falls just below the state threshold requiring the Public Service Commission to approve the site. Meridian Energy Group says it will be the “cleanest refinery on the planet,” but activists complain it's too close, just three miles from the national park.
Federal geologists agree to reevaluate the amount of recoverable crude oil in North Dakota. U.S. Senator John Hoeven and industry officials requested the new assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey, saying it would likely attract investment by showing stronger production potential. They want the USGS to take into account 17 other formations in western North Dakota that could be exploited using technology developed for the Bakken and the Three Forks.
Thirteen oil companies failed to meet North Dakota's natural gas flaring goals in September. The Bismarck Tribune reports operators in September burned off more than 300 million cubic feet of natural gas daily — a level not seen since the summer of 2015. But Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms says the state's gas capture targets are working “extremely well.” He says they've brought the percentage of gas flared down from the peak of 36 percent in September 2011. Flaring is expected to be down to 12 percent next year and down to nine percent by 2020.
Channel 5 is adding 1,500 hours of new content from the likes of PBS America and A+E to its My5 streaming service.
The Viacom-owned U.K. broadcaster already had a deal with A+E. It has now extended the agreement for content from the channel operator's Blaze service. Titles from PBS America, the U.K. digital channel run by PBS Distribution, will also be added as Channel 5 ramps up its lineup of shows from third parties. There will also be new programming from Viacom stablemate BET.
The new shows will start to be added to My5 this month and 1,500 hours will be added in all over the next year. PBS America documentaries on My5 will include “Secrets of Stonehenge” (pictured), “Becoming the Beatles,” and “The History Detectives.”
The deal with A+E covers U.S. titles including “Swamp People,” “Pawn Stars,” and “Billy the Exterminator.”
With Netflix and Amazon gaining ground, the U.K.'s incumbent broadcasters, including the newest of the traditional players, Channel 5, are bolstering their streaming services. Channel 5 has bulked up My5 and Channel 4 is also adding third-party content to its service, recently striking a 900-hour deal for Vice programming. The changes effectively change the streaming offerings from catch-up services to platforms, with content from different suppliers.
“Viewers have come to expect a lot more from streaming services and this new slate of partners accelerates the development of My5 as we take it from player to platform,” said James Tatam, VP of commercial, digital & operations, Channel 5. “We look forward to announcing further content partners in future.”
For third-parties, striking deals with the likes of My5 means an additional free-TV outlet for their content. “Our launch on My5 gives us a great shop window for our offering in the free streaming world,” said Richard Kingsbury, general manager, PBS America.
Iran Focus
London, 6 Dec - In advance of the international Human Rights Day, members of the parliament of the European Union held a conference on EU policy towards Iran, in which they advised that the EU must- at the very least- condition its relationship with Iran with an improvement to human rights in the country.
On Wednesday, December 6, the Friends of a Free Iran (FOFI) intergroup met in Brussels to discuss the appalling human rights abuses in Iran from the 1988 massacre, which killed 30,000 political prisoners, to the current wave of arbitrary imprisonments of dual or foreign nationals.
The panel was attended by FOFI chair Gerald Deprez, the President of the European Iraqi Freedom Association Struan Stevenson, Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki, MEP Ivan Štefanec, British MEP Anthea McIntyre, Belgian MEP Mark Demesmaeker, Austrian MEP Heinz Becker, the president-elect of the Iranian Resistance Maryam Rajavi, and various other politicians.
Executions
The conference addressed the growing number of executions in Iran- some 3,500 under the so-called moderate Hassan Rouhani, who defended the accusations as God's will. The experts addressed that this was much more than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, considered a “hardliner” by the West.
Of course, there is no such thing as moderates in the Iranian Regime.
McIntyre said: “We have seen a deterioration of human rights and the shocking rise of executions in Iran since Hassan Rouhani took office [in 2013. Last month] the Iranian state media was filled with pictures of EU reps meeting with Iranian officials. They failed to say that 18 executions took place during their visit.”
Becker said: “We should be loud in telling the regime that enough is enough; time has come for their accountability. All relations with Iran must be conditioned on an end to executions.”
1988 Massacre
In the summer of 1988, the Iranian Regime ordered the execution of 30,000 political prisoners in just a few months. After a series of show trials, tens of thousands of people were slaughtered and no one has been held to account for this is nearly 30 years.
Štefanec said: “The massacre of 30,000 political prisoners in Iran in summer 1988 was a Crime Against Humanity. I call for an investigation into this crime because you can't ask the thief to investigate his own crime. Ironically, the EU has been silent on this.”
Rajavi said that Iran must be held accountable for their crimes in 1988, as many of those who were responsible for the crime still hold high-ranking positions within the Regime.
Deprez said: “The Regime today is the same as the one in 1988, only the faces change.”
Women's Rights
Women's rights are heavily restricted under the Iranian Regime. They not only have restrictions on things like employment, travel and dress, but are also discriminated against by the so-called justice system.
McIntyre said: “Defeating Islamic fundamentalism begins with women rights and human rights. If we could see a democratically elected Maryam Rajavi in charge of Iran we could defeat Islamic fundamentalism.”
Becker said: “We in the European Parliament are obliged to help you and I pledge to do my best. I address the women of Iran and tell them: Keep up fighting. We know you and we support you”
Arbitrary imprisonments
Stevenson brought up the case of British aid worker Nazanin Zaghari Radcliffe, who is being held on bogus charges in Iran. She is one of many falsely imprisoned in Iran.
Resistance and Protest
The Iranian people have long stood up against the Iranian Regime and Rajavi indicated that the situation was not reaching an explosive point, especially following the recent earthquake, which highlighted the Regime's corruption and fear over popular protests.
She said: “A nationwide protest movement has been going on for one year and growing by people whose assets have been plundered by financial institutes licensed by the government. On numerous occasions, these protests have turned into political protests against the entire regime.”
Czarnecinki spoke of the relocation of Iranian dissidents to safety in Albania and noted that the Regime had sent a delegation to the country o spread misinformation and incite violence against the Iranians because they were upset that the Resistance was being supported.
Support for Iranian Resistance
All of the panel members expressed their personal support for the Iranian Resistance and especially Rajavi's 10-point-plan for the future of a free Iran.
Czarnecki and Deprez said that they, along with hundreds of colleagues in EU Parliament, supported Rajavi's 10 point plan.
Deprez said that Rajavi's fight for human rights was remarkable and called on all democratic people in the west to support the Iranian resistance.
Demesmaeker said: “In Iran, we have a very competent and ready democratic alternative led by Mrs. Rajavi. We saw the support for Mrs. Rajavi when 100,000 supporters gathered in Paris… Rajavi's ten-point plan calls for the abolition of the death penalty in Iran.”
The conference also discussed the Iranian Regime's nefarious regional conduct, support of terrorism, and dangerous ballistic missile programme. This includes the mobilisation of the IRGC, and the dispatch of Afghan refugee to the Syrian war.
One of the key points that the conference agreed on, is that regime change is needed in Iran.
Feuerstein, who is also one of the show's six executive producers (as well as its co-creator), based "9JKL" on his own recent experience of moving back in with his parents. While giving journalists a tour of the show's set this summer, a reporter asked if there was a reason that the characters' Jewishness goes unmentioned -- was there some desire to downplay it, in a current climate of anger and hate? (Or is it more like a "Goldbergs" thing, in which the ABC comedy coasted for a couple of seasons on an implied Jewishness, until the Goldbergs finally celebrated Hanukkah?) If a show seems in every way about Jews but also seems to assiduously avoid saying so, what is the non-Jewish viewer supposed to think -- that it's too hot to bring up in the touchy, temperamentally divisive America of 2017?
According to a transcript of the set visit, Feuerstein said he expected "9JKL" to be more direct about the Roberts family's faith in later episodes. "I am very proud to be a Jew," he said. "I'm very happy to say to you that, yes, this family is Jewish. And we will take our time with how we treat those issues."
This might be more germane if "9JKL" felt like the sort of sitcom with staying power (TV critic's rule of thumb: whenever David Walton is in the cast, it's a subliminal cry for cancellation), or if the show could somehow convey a sense of television's long, interesting history with Jewish New Yorkers and the fabulous apartments they've lived in. Entire theses, after all, have been written about the significance of sitcom living arrangements. Sadly, the show gets off to a dreadful non-start. Old pros like Lavin and Gould are given no choice but to play their parts way, way over the top, because their characters have been brushed far too broadly, with jokes that are beyond stale.
To drop Jill Soloway's Emmy-winning, consistently superb Amazon dramedy "Transparent" into a discussion of "9JKL" seems rather unfair -- like comparing the smartest kid in the class to the dumbest.
Yet here they are, the success of one surprisingly relevant to the failure of the other (and each featuring parents who dote on a Joshie), with "Transparent" furthering its proud and frank exploration of how being transgender might closely and eerily mirror the outsider experience of being an American Jew.
In season 4, now streaming, Maura Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor) is invited to speak at a gender conference in Tel Aviv; her youngest daughter, Ali (Gaby Hoffman), decides to tag along at the last minute. On the way to catch their flight at LAX, Maura softly sings a calming line from "Everything's Alright," a Mary Magdalene number from the 1970 rock opera "Jesus Christ Superstar," an album Ali subconsciously recalls hearing from as far back as the womb. "Oh my God," she says, recognizing the tune. "You guys were obsessed with that."
After nibbling one of Ali's pot candies to relax herself, Maura has a humiliating experience in airport security, set to the raucous section of "Superstar" in which Jesus confronts the money-changers at the Temple of Jerusalem; Maura hallucinates an image of Ali sailing through TSA on the arms of men in Orthodox dress. The scene is at once hilarious, disturbing and sublime -- and among "Transparent's" finest.
In Israel, Maura and Ali make a startling family discovery that lures the rest of the Pfefferman clan to join them -- daughter Sarah (Amy Landecker) and her husband Len (Rob Huebel); son Josh (Jay Duplass); Maura's ex-wife Shelly (Judith Light) and Maura's sister Bryna (Jenny O'Hara). On a bus tour that includes the Wailing Wall and the Dead Sea, the family experiences another series of self-realizations, while snippets of the "Superstar" soundtrack ("What's the Buzz?"; "I Don't Know How to Love Him") rattle around in their heads. Ali, who continuously opens new doors to her own sense of identity, parts ways with her family to visit Palestinian friends, with eye-opening results.
Though the episodes in this season are short (careful, or you'll blow through all 10 in one sitting), a viewer can sense that "Transparent" is nearing a conclusion -- if not literally, then at least thematically, as far as its Jewish/trans dialogue goes. The Pfeffermans will continue to have their hang-ups, problems and assorted issues, but what's striking now is the way Maura has become a peaceful, gravitational centre in the lives of her family and friends. She has made it home in every sense of the word, and everything's all right.
“9JKL” (30 minutes) airs Monday at 8:30 p.m. on CBS and Global.
“Transparent” (Season 4, 10 episodes) is available on Amazon.

QUETTA - A resolution demanding a one-month delay in the upcoming general elections was adopted by the Balochistan Assembly on Wednesday.
The resolution, submitted by Balochistan Home Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti, demanded that the elections should be held in August, instead of July this year, because “a majority of the public wants to undertake Haj for which [many] would be travelling to Saudi Arabia in July” and hence, they would be unable to vote in the elections.
The resolution also expressed concern that the province receives monsoon downpours during the month of July, due to which many districts face flooding and a lot of residents are forced to move to other areas for shelter.
Such a situation would deprive these people of the opportunity to vote, it states.
Keeping these concerns in mind, the provincial government is requesting to ask the Federal government to instead hold the elections in the last week of August so that everyone can exercise their Constitutional right to vote, the resolution adds.
President Mamnoon Hussain last week approved a summary sent by the Election Commission of Pakistan for general elections to be held on July 25, 2018.
The current government will complete its five-year term on May 31. The caretaker government, under the leadership of Justice (Retd) Nasirul Mulk, will then take over to ensure a smooth transition of power after the elections.

The great Andrew Klavan has pointed out that some of the best free entertainment on the Internet is found at Everyday Feminism. Right now the site is running a wonderful satire. . . oh wait—this is for real! The item is “Ten Things Every Intersectional Feminist Should Ask on a First Date.” Keep your hot coffee mugs away from your keyboards.
As a queer femme of color, I keep close relationships with people who go beyond allyship; they're true accomplices in the fight against white supremacy, queerphobia, and misogyny. If you're not going to support marginalized folks, then we can't be friends, let alone date. The personal is political. . .
The following list of questions is applicable to all relationships — certainly not just cisgender, heterosexual ones:
1. Do you believe that Black Lives Matter?
Yes? Wonderful. Let's start here. There are three categories that are non-negotiables for me: an understanding of race, class, and gender. Not everyone understands how these three can be insidious, systemic and intertwined, but anyone who doesn't take the time to learn how systemic racism works isn't going to care about how racism affects me or people who are darker-skinned than I am. . .
2. What are your thoughts on gender and sexual orientation?
The gender binary is a tiny box and I wish it didn't exist, but it does. I wouldn't want to be with anyone who is queer-phobic. One out of many important elements to dismantling patriarchy is to abolish gender roles as well as the limited understanding that we have about sexuality and gender itself. I can't imagine being with someone who is transphobic; as a feminist and woman of color, it would be a betrayal of what I stand for. Ignoring trans-misogynoir would be to deny one of the biggest, most despicable problems that we face.
Alabama's price gouging law is in effect after Gov. Kay Ivey's State of Emergency declaration, Attorney General Steve Marshall announced.
The State of Emergency took effect at 7 a.m. Friday. According to sections 8-31-1 through 8-31-6 of the Code of Alabama, it is unlawful for any person within the state to impose unconscionable prices for the sale or rental of any commodity or rental facility during the period of a declared State of Emergency.
Marshall warned anyone who exploits bad weather conditions for profit will be held accountable. What constitutes as an unconscionable price is not specifically set forth in state law, but a price 25 percent or more above the average price charged in the same area within a month is an example of price gouging, unless the increase can be attributed to a reasonable cost.
The penalty for price gouging is a fine of up to $1,000 per violation, and repeat offenders could be barred from doing business in Alabama.
Anyone who suspects price gouging is happening at a business can call the Attorney General's Office of Consumer Protection at 1-800-392-5658 or visit their website.

IPID executive director Robert McBride presented an explosive report to Parliament's police committee on Wednesday claiming that the Minister of Police, Nathi Nhleko, was protecting acting Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane, currently being investigated for defeating the ends of justice and possible corruption. McBride said Nhleko regularly ignored IPID reports into wrongdoing by SAPS members. The IPID sketched a Medellín-like scenario of gangs of SAPS and Hawks members fighting and shooting each other at OR Tambo International in an all-out war to control drugs confiscated from smugglers. McBride also cleared up forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan's role as the complainant in the Phahlane matter. It was lit, as they say. By MARIANNE THAMM.
While Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko might have accompanied embattled acting Commissioner of Police Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane at his appearance before Parliament's police committee on February 1 in a show of apparent political support, IPID executive director Robert McBride on Wednesday enigmatically told the committee that he enjoyed “complete political support where it matters”.
Asked by a committee member why the minister was not present, McBride replied acerbically, “I am sure he would have loved to have given his support but must be caught up elsewhere.”
The comment reveals the extent of the massive political rupture between the SAPS, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) and the Minister of Police on the one hand, and those seeking to expose alleged corruption and abuse of state power on the other.
McBride did not hold back on Wednesday, saying that while IPID was underfunded, some of the high-profile cases the directorate was investigating included cases where SAPS and Hawks members had shot at each other in what appears to be a drugs feeding frenzy at OR Tambo International Airport. (Co-incidentally, O'Sullivan's “war” with former convicted Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi was sparked by similar issues relating to Sap criminality when O'Sullivan was head of ACSA security before he was fired in 2003.)
McBride said police officials were not only killing each other to get their hands on drugs confiscated from mules, but were illegally shifting quantities of drugs through domestic arrivals (presumably while the rest of us sip coffee and tap on our laptops in free wifi areas).
In another case involving SAPS in Sunnyside Pretoria, said McBride, police officers were specifically targeting foreign nationals, seeking to extort money, and – if this was not forthcoming – confiscating stashes of drugs to sell on to the public themselves.
The shocking revelations prompted ANC committee member Leonard Ramatlakane to remark that the situation was reminiscent of drug-infested Bogotá in Columbia.
In reply to questions with regard to the involvement of forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan in the IPID probe into Commissioner Phahlane, IPID head of investigations, Matthews Sesoko, said O'Sullivan was the complainant in the matter and had provided information “that usually checks out”. McBride later added that he had “the utmost respect” for the investigator.
He told Parliament that O'Sullivan had provided former IPID head Israel Kgamanyane with information but that Kgamanyane, instead of investigating the claims, had informed Commissioner Phahlane. (McBride had been illegally suspended by the minister at the time.)
The IPID head said he regularly sent reports to the Minister of Police who simply sent them back. He had sent a note on Phahlane, he said, “but it is difficult to envisage that he will take the recommendations seriously”.
Phahlane, added McBride, had in the meantime, and since the investigation became public, received a bravery award as well another award “from churches”.
The arrest on Friday of attorney Sarah Jane Trent and later of Paul O'Sullivan were attempts at derailing the investigation into Phahlane, said McBride, and were designed to intimidate them. There was not, he added, “a snowball's chance in hell that the charges [that they impersonated IPID officers] would stick”.
“Unfortunately for General Phahlane we have recordings of all interactions and at no time time (did) O'Sullivan or Trent present themselves as IPID investigators,” McBride said.
He said when Commissioner Phahlane found out he was being investigated he called in Major-General Mabula, who is under investigation for murder, to intimidate and arrest Trent and O'Sullivan.
“Phahlane has also phoned some of the witnesses,” said McBride.
McBride voiced concern about the independence of IPID and the Hawks after Minister Nhleko offered Kgamanyane a position with the Hawks after he [McBride] had been reinstated. Kgamanyane has been accused of attempting to purge IPID of staff loyal to McBride.
“I am really worried about this. It seems as if the minister told Kgamanyane ‘don't worry if they bring back McBride, I will find you a job'.”
He suggested that Phahlane had lied to Parliament when he told the committee that he was unaware of the IPID investigation.
“It is easy to target O'Sullivan when the issue is Phahlane's corruption.”
Committee chair Francois Beukman asked McBride to keep in contact with the oversight committee and that it would monitor developments. DM

LAHORE - The Punjab government told the Lahore High Court on Friday that the paper of Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) was leaked.
Special Health Secretary Sajid Chohan told the court a day after Minister for Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Kh Salman Rafiq told the media the same at a hurriedly-called press conference at the DGPR.
A fresh test will be conducted in the last week of the ongoing month. He said the vice-chancellor of the University of Health Sciences (UHS) had been sacked and an FIR had been lodged against those involved in the paper leak. Some accused had been taken into custody, he told the court. On this, Justice Shahid Waheed disposed of petitions moved by MDCAT candidates on Aug 20 for admission to MBBS.

New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday defended the budgetary proposals and allocations made in the Union Budget 2018 and said he had tried to address the genuine concerns of all segments of the society, especially the salaried class and the poor. In an exclusive interview to Zee Media, Jaitley spoke about a host of issues ranging from the ''ease of living'', benefits to the salaried class, housing for all, boost to the rural sector, infrastructure, job creation and announcement of several welfare schemes like the National Health Protection Scheme, which he billed as the world's largest government-funded healthcare programme.
''I have given several benefits to salaried class in the past three years. I tried to give relief to salaried class with my budget. I have always taken care of the salaried class in all my budgets, standard deduction worth Rs 8,000 crore has been given to the salaried class,'' Jaitley said. ''I have given benefits to the tune of Rs 12,000 crore to the middle class,'' he said and added that ''this is in the interest of the economy too.''

He also categorically rejected suggestions that the budget has hugely disappointed the middle class, especially the salaried class. ''We have introduced many structural reforms. I believe gains from these structural reforms will consolidate in coming two years. It was a challenging budget in terms of meeting fiscal challenges. Yet, we managed to maintain a balance between generating jobs and keeping the economy strong,'' he said.
''The first right on government's treasury is that of the poor. All I can say is that people have accepted the budget,'' the Finance Minister said.
While acknowledging that narrowing the tax slab is a big challenge, he said, ''Salaried class is honest in paying their taxes. So, I thought of giving Rs 12,000 crore relief to middle class in my budget.'' He also pointed out that the Union Budget 2018 also gave a huge relief to senior citizens. "The budget gave huge relief to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore to the senior citizens,'' the Finance Minister said.
During the interview, Jaitley stressed that the duty structure needs to be expanded to help the business community. Referring to the government's allocation of Rs 14.34 trillion for rural infrastructure, he said, ''Price fixation of Minimum Support Price (MSP) in future will be based on need and principles.''
''If you connect a village through road, give electricity to several households, provide toilets inside the houses under the ''Swachh Bharat'', it is all a panoramic view on the development of rural sector. Then comes the role of schemes like MNREGA to provide employment,'' Jaitley said. The Finance Minister expressed hope that ''slowly and gradually, this will improve the lifestyle of people living in rural areas."
He also rejected fears that disappointing announcements in the budget like on the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax and a higher-than-expected fiscal deficit target for 2018-19 have dampened the risk-taking appetite of investors.
To a question referring to suggestions of conducting simultaneous polls in the country, he said, ''I don't see that happening very soon.''
Jaitley had on Thursday presented what was the last full budget of the Narendra Modi government. The budget primarily focussed on agriculture and rural sectors and came up with 'world's largest' health insurance scheme for 50 crore Indians.
The budget projected the economic growth above 8 percent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described it as a vehicle to build a 'new India'.
The budget is "farmer friendly, common citizen friendly, business environment-friendly" and will add to "ease of living and ease of doing business," he said in a televised address.
With the playoffs quickly approaching, it's clear that the Tampa Bay Lightning will be buyers at this year's trade deadline. While the Lightning have been one of the league leaders all season long, they could use some defensive insurance before the playoff gauntlet begins. Despite featuring a fairly deep defensive unit that can provide scoring and suppress opponents, there is a noticeable hole in their top pairing. For the majority of this season, Jake Dotchin has appeared in over his head on the top line with Victor Hedman.
This sort of noticeable issue can be covered up during the regular season when you only see an opponent a few times, but it is exploitable over a seven-game series. While the Lightning could move Anton Stralman back on the top pairing with Hedman, this would leave rookie Mikhail Sergachev exposed on the second line – another less than ideal scenario for the Lightning. With this in mind, the Lightning need to find a defenseman who can play top-pairing minutes with Hedman or act as a mentor for Sergachev throughout his first playoff experience.
All-Star Mike Green Fits the Lightning's Needs
Of the defensemen likely available at the deadline, Mike Green is the perfect player for the Lightning. While playing with a rebuilding Red Wing's franchise, Green averaged 35 points each season in route to an All-Star nomination in 2018. Along with these solid offensive numbers, he consistently plays 20 or more minutes each night, giving the Lightning a needed minute-eating defenseman. Besides, he is a right-handed defenseman who slots in beautifully next to lefty Victor Hedman.
Even if Green doesn't work on the top pairing, having another All-Star defenseman on the roster would allow for Anton Stralman to move back onto the top line with Green taking over next to Sergachev. With over 750 regular season games and an additional 76 games of playoff experience, Green would be the perfect mentor for the 19-year-old Sergachev.
Green Is a Worthy Investment for the Lightning
Cost-wise, Green would be an expensive deadline acquisition for the Lightning. With relatively few defensemen available, the Red Wings will be demanding top dollar for their premier blueliner. Looking at rental defensemen trades over recent seasons, he will garner at least a first-round draft pick, a roster player and a conditional pick in the second to fourth round range. This price could be even higher if teams on the outside of the tight Metropolitan division decide to make a run at the playoffs instead of selling.
While this cost is far from cheap, it would be a smart investment by Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman. With the Lightning considered a contender for the Stanley Cup this season, they need a roster that can keep up with the multi-month grind of the playoffs. Without adding a player of Green's caliber, the Lightning are one blocked shot away from having to heavily rely on Dotchin and Andrej Sustr to carry the right side. With their less than consistent play, this could spell disaster for Tampa's Stanley Cup dreams.
Lightning Giving Green a Trial Run
This offseason, Green will be an unrestricted free agent. For the Lightning, bringing him into the franchise for a playoff run would be the perfect time to introduce him to Tampa. If he fits well with the team, Yzerman could work to re-sign him on a two or three-year contract to stabilize the Lightning's defense while prospects gain a few more years of needed experience.
At 32 years old, Green will be looking for a multi-year contract that brings him both job security and a consistent chance to win a Stanley Cup. In their current form, the Lightning will be a championship contender for the next few seasons, lining up with Green's ambitions. Given Yzerman's ability to re-sign players to favorable contracts, it wouldn't be surprising to see Green retained for more than just one playoff run.
Looking for Greener Pastures
Even if Green were brought in for just one playoff run, he is the right choice for the Lightning right now. He not only fixes the Lightning's largest issues on defense, he also provides an experienced locker room presence for a Stanley Cup push. Even with a team as strong as the Lightning, you can never have enough talented, high-character players on your roster.

The national leader of the MS-13 "Molinos" clique admitted he ordered the murder of a 15-year-old on an East Boston beach in 2015 as part of his plea in U.S. District Court in Boston on Thursday, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.
Oscar Duran, known as "Demente," entered a guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy and racketeering under the RICO, or racketeering conspiracy, statute. He faces the potential of life in prison when he is sentenced June 8.
Duran was one of 61 people named in the fifth superseding indictment handed up by a federal grand jury. The indictment alleges that between 2014 and 2016, members of MS-13 were responsible for six murders, 20 attempted murders and robberies and drug trafficking in and around Massachusetts.
Duran is considered the leader of the Molinos clique nationally as well as his home area of East Boston. prosecutors said Duran encouraged his members to commit crimes, including murder. One of those was the stabbing death of a 15-year-old, identified by the Boston Globe as Wilson Martinez, in East Boston.
Duran is the 35th defendant to be found guilty under the indictment, and the sixth person found guilty of the murder of Martinez.

The entire city of Lahore is drenched in water. After a long and torturous spell of heat, the rain has finally made its way to the city. However the problem is that while people were desperately waiting for the monsoon rain to push away the heat, they were also expecting the government to have made necessary measures to deal with the showers of rain which would disrupt the set up of the city. Lack and failure of rain management after 70 years of running a country and that too in a city considered the most developed is a huge disappointment, not just for the residents but also for the authorities in charge.
This is not the first time monsoon rains have managed to bring the city to a halt. Rains are a common occurrence during the monsoon season and can be predicted easily to make the necessary arrangements but it is no secret that our lawmakers prefer adhocism and policies and measures that result out of it. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Pakistan has witnessed more rain before this during the month of July, which clearly points out the failure of the authorities to prioritise their spending and come up with projects which help in times like these.
Time before the elections is very crucial and it is disasters such as these which makes room for criticism. PMLN's campaign is structured around promising cities and towns the future like that of Lahore but Lahore itself is underwater now because even the roads which were prioritised could not stand against the rainfall. This shows how underdeveloped the drainage system is, which allows mega cities to be converted to areas of ditches and potholes. The amount of damage done in a day is going to cost a lot and will definitely become one of the factors for the local population to decide their vote upon.
BAGHDAD (AP) — A service member in the U.S.-led coalition battling the Islamic State group has died in a “non-combat related incident” in Iraq.
A statement from the U.S. military said the service member was killed on Monday, without providing further details. It did not identify the individual or give a nationality.
According to the Pentagon, there are 4,815 U.S. troops in Iraq, including special operations forces. They are mainly providing logistical and other support to Iraqi combat forces, but have been operating closer to the front lines as part of a massive operation to retake the IS-held city of Mosul.

Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas labelled the US ambassador to Israel David Friedman a "son of a dog" on Monday during an attack on Donald Trump's policies.
The scathing comments come with US President Trump still expected to launch a plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians despite Abbas boycotting his administration over his controversial recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
"The US ambassador in Tel Aviv is a settler and a son of a dog," Abbas said in comments to Palestinian leaders in Ramallah.
The White House later Monday slammed Abbas's "insults", saying he must choose between hate and peace.
"The time has come for President Abbas to choose between hateful rhetoric and concrete and practical efforts to improve the quality of life of his people and lead them to peace and prosperity," top Trump aide Jason Greenblatt said in a terse statement
Relations between Abbas's government and Trump's administration have broken down since the White House recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December.
The Palestinians also see the disputed city as the capital of their future state and have refused to meet with Trump's envoys since.
Friedman, who was Trump's personal lawyer before being appointed last year, is a longstanding supporter of settlement building in the occupied West Bank, considered illegal under international law.
In response to Abbas, Friedman, who is Jewish, told a conference that Abbas's comments could have anti-Semitic connotations.
"His response was to refer to me as son of a dog. Is that anti-Semitism or political discourse? I leave that up to you," he said, according to a US embassy spokeswoman.
Abbas's comments appeared to be in response to a tweet by Friedman earlier on Monday.
In it he referred to an attack in the West Bank as "in the north", raising questions over whether he views it as part of Israeli territory, and accused Abbas's Palestinian Authority (PA) of failing to condemn it.
"Such brutality and no condemnation from the PA!" he tweeted, referring to a Friday car ramming that killed two soldiers and a Sunday stabbing in Jerusalem that left an Israeli dead, both carried out by Palestinians.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later denounced Abbas's remarks on Twitter.
"For the first time in decades, the US administration has stopped pampering Palestinian leaders and tells them 'that's enough'. Apparently the shock of the truth has caused them to lose their mind," he said.
Israel has militarily occupied the West Bank and east Jerusalem since 1967.
Abbas's government has limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank, while the Jewish state annexed east Jerusalem in a move never recognised by the international community.
All countries currently have their embassies in Tel Aviv and view the future status of Jerusalem as a matter to be negotiated between the parties.
But in December Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and in May Friedman will become the first US ambassador in the city as the embassy is moved.
- Bomb attack -Separately during the speech, Abbas accused rival Palestinian faction Hamas of a bomb attack targeting his prime minister Rami Hamdallah last week and threatened fresh sanctions against the Islamist movement.
Abbas had previously said Hamas was responsible as it controls security in the Palestinian enclave, but Monday evening said it was "behind the attack".
Hamdallah was uninjured in last Tuesday's attack, which saw a roadside bomb explode as his convoy entered Gaza in what Palestinian officials have called an assassination attempt.
Six of his security guards were lightly hurt.
In the speech to Palestinian leaders in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Abbas said if the attack had succeeded it would have "opened the way for a bloody civil war".
Hamas condemned what it called Abbas's "provocative positions," saying its security services were still investigating the explosion.
The Islamists and Abbas's secular party Fatah have been at odds since 2007 when Hamas seized control of Gaza in a near civil war.
Abbas controls the internationally recognised Palestinian government, based in the occupied West Bank which Hamdallah leads.
Abbas has previously taken a series of measures, including reducing electricity payments for Gaza's two million residents, in what analysts said was an attempt to punish Hamas.
Hamas and Fatah agreed a reconciliation agreement in October but it has collapsed. DM
Vijay Antony's upcoming political action thriller Yeman will be hitting the screens in February.
An official announcement in this regard has been made by Lyca Productions, producers of the movie.
Directed by Jeeva Shankar of Naan and Amara Kaviyam fame, the audio launch of the film will be happening next month. The film will also simultaneously release in Telugu.
The film features Vijay Antony and Mia George in the lead roles and began production during January 2016.release at January 26 2017.
In December 2015, Jeeva Shankar announced that his next film would feature Vijay Antony and the pair would collaborate after working together in Naan (2012).
He revealed that the film would be set in Chennai and Vijay Antony would portray the character who brings “the message of death”.
Vijay Antony put on weight for the film and began working on the project during the same month, with the producers revealing that the film would be shot within eighty days.
Thiagarajan joined the film's cast during May 2016 and revealed that he would portray the lead antagonist of a “political mastermind”.
Alexey Marchenko — an experienced NHL defenceman and potentially a solid depth piece for the Maple Leafs heading into the coming season — is reportedly returning to Russia's Kontinental Hockey League.
Marchenko's agent, Dan Milstein, tweeted Monday that the Russian blue-liner had been placed on waivers by the Leafs, with more details to come on Tuesday. Reports surfaced later Monday that the 25-year-old would be joining CSKA Moscow.
Marchenko, who was born in Moscow, played four seasons with CSKA before his NHL debut with the Detroit Red Wings in the 2013-14 season.
A seventh-round pick by the Wings in 2011, he notched four goals and 17 assists in 121 career NHL games — including a goal and an assist in 11 games in Toronto. Leafs coach Mike Babcock knew Marchenko's game from his days in Detroit and Toronto claimed him in February, after waiving defenceman Frank Corrado.
Marchenko's exit could help the Leafs' salary cap situation. His deal calls for a $1.45-million U.S. cap hit this coming season. He could earn more in the KHL.

PITTSBURGH -- The weather keeps wreaking havoc on the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Detroit Tigers.
Steady rain at PNC Park on Tuesday forced the clubs to postpone a game for the third time in the first month of the season.
Editor's Picks Manfred says new pace-of-play rules 'effective' Commissioner Rob Manfred applauded MLB's new pace-of-play rules, saying the number of mound visits are "way down" and inning breaks are "significantly shorter" so far this season.
The game was the 28th postponement in the majors this season, the most related to weather through April since the commissioner's office started keeping those records in 1986. Baltimore and Tampa Bay were also rained out on Tuesday.
Detroit and Pittsburgh will make up the game with a straight doubleheader on Wednesday starting at 4:05 p.m.
This is the second time the teams will play a doubleheader this season and the third time they've had to reschedule due to weather. Wintry conditions pushed back opening day at Comerica Park on March 29 and their game on March 31 was also postponed. Pittsburgh swept a doubleheader from the Tigers on April 1. Detroit also had two games against the New York Yankees wiped out earlier this month.
Pittsburgh will send out Jameson Taillon (2-1, 2.86) in Game 1 against Detroit's Jordan Zimmermann (1-0, 7.71). Chad Kuhl (2-1, 4.57), who had been scheduled to start on Tuesday and was originally slated to take the hill for the opener of the doubleheader, will face Matthew Boyd (0-1, 1.40) in the nightcap.
The Pirates have dropped six of seven following a hot start, while the Tigers have won five of seven.
Pittsburgh's offense has cooled off during its current slide and manager Clint Hurdle believes his team's struggles are part of a somewhat larger trend, one the weather is impacting. There could be more strikeouts than hits across the majors in a month for the first time, and Hurdle pointed to frigid temperatures as an issue.
"This has been the most challenging weather I've ever been a part of, and I'm not playing," said Hurdle, who spent a decade in the majors as a player from 1977 to '87 before going into coaching. "It's hard to hit when it's cold."
Pittsburgh had more strikeouts than hits in each game while dropping a four-game set with Philadelphia last week. Hurdle pointed to his own experiences as a player as proof that when conditions aren't ideal, hitting can become painful.
"Sometimes, you can only have one bad at-bat, the first at-bat of a game, in this kind of weather, (and) that can rearrange your mental furniture," he said. "I know if I hit a ball right off the end of the bat, that first at-bat, I knew I didn't want to do it again. Some of my aggressiveness might have leaked out of me."
Last month, Netflix canceled The Get Down, its crazily expensive rap-prehistory melodrama. That leaves Jaden Smith, one of the show's stars, unemployed. So he's done what any deeply strange, overwhelmingly rich and famous young person would do if he suddenly found himself with time on his hands. He's made a very silly music video in which he plays a tortured superhero.
Smith famously wore an all-white Batman costume to Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's wedding, and now he's brought that suit out again in his music video for “Batman,” a song that's a barely-disguised rewrite of Drake and Future's “Jumpman.” In the clip, we see Jaden, in full Batman gear, attempting to brood, lurking above the Los Angeles skyline at the golden hour, and getting into dance-fights with other superhero-costumed lunatics on Hollywood Boulevard. Director Moises Arias is the guy who played Rico on Hannah Montana. It's really something. Check it out below, via Noisey.
Fun fact: Jaden Smith is now 18, which is the same age that his father was when DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince released “Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble.” “Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble” > “Batman.”
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysian police arrested a woman Wednesday in connection with the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half brother.
Police released a statement saying the woman was carrying Vietnamese travel documents when she was arrested at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
Kim Jong Nam died Monday after suddenly falling ill at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport, said a senior Malaysian government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case involves sensitive diplomacy.
Kim, who died on the way to a hospital, told medical workers that he had been attacked with a chemical spray, the official said.
Malaysian officials have provided few other details. Police said an autopsy was planned to determine the cause of death.
Related: ‘Sudden death' of Kim Jong-un's half-brother investigated
Since taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has executed or purged a slew of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a “reign of terror.”
South Korea's spy service said Wednesday that North Korea had been trying for five years to kill Kim. But the National Intelligence Service did not definitively say that North Korea was behind the killing, just that it was presumed to be a North Korean operation, according to lawmakers who briefed reporters about the closed door meeting with the spy officials.
The NIS cited Kim Jong-un's alleged “paranoia” about his half brother. Still, the agency has a history of botching intelligence on North Korea and has long sought to portray the country's leaders as mentally unstable.
Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said Kim Jong Nam was killed at the airport by two women believed to be North Korean agents. They fled in a taxi and were being sought by Malaysian police, the reports said.
Police were searching for clues in the closed circuit television footage from the airport, said Selangor police chief Abdul Samah Mat. The airport is in Selangor, near Kuala Lumpur.
According to the Malaysian government official, Kim Jong Nam was in a shopping concourse and had not yet gone through security for a planned flight to Macau when the incident occurred.
Kim was estranged from his half brother, the North Korean leader. Although he had been originally tipped by some outsiders as a possible successor to his late dictator father, Kim Jong Il, others thought that was unlikely because he lived outside the country, including recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia.
He reportedly fell further out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.
A Malaysian police statement confirmed the death of a North Korean man whom it identified from his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang on June 10, 1970.
Ken Gause, who is with the CNA think tank in Washington and has studied North Korea's leadership for 30 years, said Kim Chol was a name that Kim Jong Nam had traveled under. He is believed to have been born May 10, 1971.
While the most likely explanation for the killing was that Kim Jong-un was removing a potential challenger to North Korean leadership within his own family, he could also be sending a warning to North Korean officials to demonstrate the reach of the regime. It follows the defection last year of a senior diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in London who has spoken of his despair at Kim's purges.
Mark Tokola, vice president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington and a former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, said it would be surprising if Kim Jong Nam was not killed on the orders of his half brother, given that North Korean agents have reportedly tried to assassinate Kim Jong Nam in the past.
“It seems probable that the motivation for the murder was a continuing sense of paranoia on the part of Kim Jong-un,” Tokola wrote in a commentary Tuesday. Although there was scant evidence that Kim Jong Nam was plotting against the North Korean leader, he provided an alternative for North Koreans who would want to depose his half brother.
Among Kim Jong-un's executions and purgings, the most spectacular was the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, once considered the country's second-most powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason.
Gause said Kim Jong Nam had been forthright that he did not have political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his half brother's legitimacy in the past.
Kim Jong Nam had been less outspoken since 2011, when North Korean assassins reportedly tried to shoot him in Macau, Gause said, though the details of the attempted killing are murky. South Korea also reportedly jailed a North Korean spy in 2012 who admitted to trying to organize a hit-and-run accident targeting Kim Jong Nam in China in 2010.
Despite the attempts on his life, Kim Jong Nam had reportedly traveled to North Korea since then, so it was assumed he was no longer under threat. Kim Jong Nam may have become more vulnerable, as his defender in the North Korean hierarchy, Kim Kyong Hui — Kim Jong-un's aunt and the wife of his executed uncle — appears to have fallen from favor or died. She has not been seen in public for more than three years, Gause said.
Kim Jong Il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong Nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong Chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong-un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended Eric Clapton concerts in London in 2015. It's unclear what positon he has in the North Korean government.
A younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was named a member of the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. She has a position in a propaganda and agitation department and is known as Kim Jong-un's gatekeeper, Gause said.

Additional security measures and personnel have been added to protect public safety at Sunday's Steamtown Marathon in light of this week's mass shooting in Las Vegas, race organizers and police said.
Jim Cummings, the marathon's assistant director, said security forces will follow enhanced plans that were developed following the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.
“We are building on the already stringent security plans based on what happened at Boston,” Cummings said. “We've gone to great lengths to significantly increase security more than it was years ago.”
Some of those security enhancements, which include barring runners from bringing
duffle bags to the start line, targeted stationary items that could pose a threat. The Las Vegas shooting, in which a gunman sprayed a hail of bullets into a crowd from the 32nd floor of a hotel room, highlights the threat of other types of violence.
Cummings said police asked race officials, for security purposes, not to disclose specifics regarding how they plan to address that type of threat.
“They are certainly aware of what happened in Vegas and how it happened and are taking measures to make sure it doesn't happen here,” he said.
The 26.2-mile race starts at Forest City Regional High school and winds its way through the Midvalley before ending at Courthouse Square in Scranton. This year, nearly 1,800 people registered to take part in the race, which also draws thousands of spectators.
Scranton police Chief Carl Graziano also said he could not provide specific details of security plans, other than to confirm additional personnel will be deployed.
“We have pre-race, special operations in place to try to identify threats and minimize the potential for any catastrophic events,” he said.
Cummings and Graziano reminded spectators and participants to be extra vigilant of their surroundings. Bags spectators bring to the race should not be left unattended, and organizers prefer spectators not bring any bags. They also should not hold a bag for anyone they don't know, he said.
“If they see something that seems amiss, speak to one of the police officers,” Cummings said.

A Vallejo man charged with murder in the 2015 death of a Jesse Bethel High School was in court Friday, where a date for his jury trial was set.
Zachery A. Kroll, 21, is charged with murder and robbery.
According to police, the May 14, 2015 incident occurred on a path near the Jesse Bethel campus while classes were in session. Kroll and co-defendant Elisha M. White Jr., then 16, allegedly attempted to rob Kenneth Maxwell “Max” Rusk, 17, before Kroll shot him in the back of the head. The pair were arrested the next day.
Both men have pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder.
Kroll reportedly had methamphetamine in his system at the time of the gunshot slaying, according to court discussions. Kroll's trial is set to begin at 9 a.m. March 27 in Department 4. His next court appearance is Dec. 8 for a trial readiness conference.
He remains jailed with a $1.5 million bail.
MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- It was a sight no Miami Dolphins fan wanted to see Sunday night before the postseason: Jay Ajayi, arguably the team's MVP this season, walked into the X-ray room soon after their loss to the New England Patriots to get checked out.
However, the second-year running back was jovial about 30 minutes later when meeting with the media and said he's looking forward to his playoff debut next weekend against the Pittsburgh Steelers.
“This is my first playoff in my career, so it's exciting,” Ajayi said. “We didn't get the result we wanted today, but we get the opportunity to keep playing. Every game after this is elimination. We still have a chance to go get it.”
When asked about the postgame X-rays, Ajayi would only say he was “good.” He also wouldn't confirm if his nagging shoulder injury he's had for the past couple weeks was the reason for the exam.
“I'm good,” Ajayi said.
In many ways, Ajayi helped define Miami's season.
Ajayi's slow start correlated with the team's 1-4 record through the first five games. Then, the Dolphins took off while Ajayi began on a breakout pace. He became just the fourth player in NFL history to post three 200-yard rushing games in the same season and finished with 1,213 rushing yards. Miami finished 9-2 in its last 11 games to get final wild card in the AFC.
Ajayi is the engine behind Miami's offense and most likely the biggest key to its postseason success. He ran for 204 yards in the Dolphins' win over the Steelers in Week 6 and will need another big performance in Pittsburgh for Miami to advance to the divisional round.
“The regular season is over. We know we still have a lot to play for,” Ajayi said. “We know [Pittsburgh], we're going to be ready for them. It's a playoff game, win or go home. Go get it.”

Morphing a digital collage into a wildly successful home for inspiration

Slibermann went from an advertising product specialist at Google to founding one of the most fascinating new products that can drive a different kind of user behavior than you would find anywhere else on the Web, and it's now worth more than $12 billion. That's caught the eye of advertisers as a product that could offer some kind of unique customer base that has a totally different behavior than those on Facebook and Google. And it's for good reason — people come to Pinterest to become inspired, to dig deep into topics (like cars or weddings) and then finally figure out what they want to do. And they go to Pinterest to get inspiration from things they might not have even realized they would find interesting.
Mapping out the human genome
Anne Wojcicki, CEO of 23andMe: With the hope of making the human genome searchable — just like the Internet — Wojcicki and her team founded 23andMe in 2006. Her story is not only one of innovation and science, but also navigating the complex regulatory ecosystem. The company hit a major snag when the FDA blocked the company's ability to basically do what it set out to do. Then four years later, 23andMe finally got the green light to once again start giving patients information about their genomes and the kinds of diseases they are at risk. It's the tale of a lot of work over a long period of time for the startup that's raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
Turning jaw-dropping home design photos into a massive business
Adi Tatarko and Alon Cohen, co-foudners of Houzz: If you haven't already opened Houzz, you're in for quite the ride. While Houzz could just be a guilty pleasure for many, with its curated photos of interior (and very lavish) home designs, it's also a massive business. Whenever you ask about Houzz, people in the valley would say they were quietly building their business — until the company announced its astounding $400 million financing round at a $4 billion valuation. Tatarko and Cohen have one of the quietest success stories in the Valley, and we'll get to know a little more from the married co-founders.

Iowa City police say a body found in the Iowa River is a woman who had been missing since March.
A news release from the police department says an autopsy has confirmed the body found in the Iowa River near Hills Friday is 37-year-old Katherine “Katie” Brooker. Police had requested help in finding Brooker — who had last been seen on March 10th — saying she had health issues.
Police say they investigated several leads and were unable to find Brooker until the body was discovered in the river. Investigators are still trying to determine the circumstances surrounding Brooker's disappearance and death, but say they do not believe there was any foul play.

TURANGI, New Zealand — New Zealanders still don't know who will next lead their country after a final vote count from a general election held two weeks ago tightened the close race between liberals and incumbent conservatives.
Election officials on Saturday released the final 17 per cent of the vote tally, including votes cast by people who were outside of their district or overseas during the election. The conservative National Party ended with 44 per cent of the vote, while the liberal bloc of the Labour Party and the Green Party ended with a combined 43 per cent.
Negotiations to form the next government will now begin in earnest.
Both sides will need to talk with the small New Zealand First party, led by maverick 72-year-old lawmaker Winston Peters. That party finished with 7 per cent of the vote, leaving it holding the balance of power.
Peters hasn't indicated which of the larger parties he favours. A former National Party lawmaker, Peters has formed coalitions in the past with both National and Labour.
In the 120-seat parliament, the votes translate to 56 seats for National, 46 for Labour, nine for New Zealand First and eight for the Green Party. The final vote count gave both Labour and the Green Party one extra seat apiece over their election night tally. Those came at the expense of the National Party, which lost two seats.
Prime Minister Bill English said voters had clearly favoured National over Labour and he looked forward to engaging with Peters so National could lead a strong and stable government.
The National Party has held power for the past nine years.
"Not since 1969 has the National Party finished ahead of the Labour opposition at four successive elections, and I want to thank everyone involved in this historic achievement," English said in a statement.
Labour leader Jacinda Ardern said she welcomed the final tally.
A Sioux City man who was taking his brand-new truck to be detailed today will end up requiring more than a wash and wax on the pickup.
Police Sergeant Scott Hatting says the 73-year-old man was pulling into “Hitches, Trailers and More” around 11 a.m when something went wrong. He says the man accidentally step on the gas instead of the brake as he was pulling in to park and the truck went through a window of the building and struck an employee who was working inside.
The employee was taken to the hospital as a precaution with minor injuries. Hatting says since the accident happened on private property the truck owner would not be cited. “But clearly he's at fault. The damage to his vehicle is probably around eight thousand dollars I would guess just for paint. And the building — substantially more — just because a lot of property was damaged inside as well,” officer Hatting says.
The unidentified driver was not hurt and had just bought the 2018 pickup Tuesday.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Three lakh schoolchildren in Kerala will, in two years time, come under the ICT Club, the largest students' IT network in the country managed by the state owned IT@School Project.
The club will focus on areas like animation, multimedia, hardware, electronics, language computing and internet and cyber safety.
Education Minister C Ravindranath said the programmes aims at facilitating an in-depth ICT learning environment for students to provide them with an experience of group learning as well as collaborative learning, thereby improving the efficiency of ICT enabled education in schools.
“As part of General Education Protection Mission, the Hi-School Student Group programme would be strengthened and the students' participation would be ensured in various activities,” Ravindranath said. The programme would be implemented in state run schools and a committee would be set-up with the headmaster as convener to coordinate the school level activities of the programme.
“As many as one lakh students would be part of this programme in this academic year itself and IT@School project would develop a mechanism for these students to provide the awareness and training for other students and parents. At the next academic year, another two lakh students would be covered,” said K Anvar Sadath, Executive Director of IT@School.
Various organisations such as Google (Internet Safety), Start-up Mission (Electronics) and Swathanthra Malayalam Computing will support this activity.
YEREVAN (Reuters) - A politician who forced Armenia's prime minister to resign led thousands of people on a march on Tuesday after which he said he was ready to take the reins of power and would keep up pressure on the ruling elite until they agreed to real change.

Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan, who had ruled the country as president before that for a decade, resigned on Monday after almost two weeks of street protests prompted by accusations he had manipulated the constitution to cling to power.
Lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan played an instrumental role in ousting Sarksyan, organising many of the protests and calling for the premier to go in a televised exchange before being jailed and then released. He is set to start talks with the ruling party on Wednesday.
In a move likely to prolong a political crisis that has rocked one of Russia's closest allies in the former Soviet Union, Pashinyan said on Tuesday he was ready to become the country's next prime minister.
“If people put this responsibility on me, I'm ready to become the prime minister,” Pashinyan, wearing his trademark black baseball cap and military-style T-shirt, told reporters.
The 42-year-old said the velvet revolution he had helped bring about was not over and that the next step would be the election of a new premier and the holding of an early parliamentary election.
He said he would not accept a new prime minister drawn from the ranks of the ruling Republican Party, which Sarksyan, the man he forced to resign, still leads.
If elected himself, he said he would try to maintain a balance in foreign policy, but ruled out questioning the presence of Russian military bases in Armenia or the country's membership in Russia-led military and economic alliances.
“We are not going to make any sharp geopolitical moves,” he said.
Hours earlier, Pashinyan had led thousands of people through the capital Yerevan to a hilltop memorial dedicated to the victims of Ottoman Turk massacres of Armenians in 1915, cementing his growing political stature.
Some chanted his name and waved the national flag as they marked the anniversary of the killings.
Armenia says the killings during World War One constituted genocide. Muslim-majority Turkey accepts that many Christian Armenians were killed in fighting during the war but denies the killings amounted to genocide.
Acting prime minister Karen Karapetyan, an ally of the ousted Sarksyan, said it was important to stay united amid the political tumult.
“We are going through a very difficult stage in our new history ... demonstrating to the entire world that despite difficulties and unresolved problems we are united,” Karapetyan said in a statement after laying flowers at the memorial to the victims of the massacres.
“We reaffirm our determination to build strong statehood and a free and civilised society.”

PROSPECTS UNCLEAR
Sarksyan's allies such as Karapetyan remain in important positions in government and it remains unclear whether his resignation will herald any real change.
Armenia's political parties in parliament must now put forward the name of a new prime minister within seven days.
Pashinyan has a history of political activism and was among opposition activists who demonstrated against Sarksyan's 2008 presidential election victory. Ten people were killed in clashes that followed that win.
After a period of hiding, Pashinyan surrendered to the police in 2009 and was sentenced to four years in prison for organising civil disturbances. He was released two years later under an amnesty.
“Nikol is a really popular leader, whom we trust,” Karen Mkhitaryan, a 19-year-old student, said of Pashinyan.
Politicians and experts said on Tuesday that Sarksyan had decided to step down due to what they described as unbearable pressure coming from the mass protests.
“Thousands of people were in the streets for days demanding his resignation and the moment came when he had no resources to suppress this movement,” Ararat Mirzoyan, an opposition leader, told Reuters.
Some said Sarksyan's move was a rare example of political wisdom from a leader under pressure.
“Serzh Sarksyan has confirmed once again that he is a real statesman,” Eduard Sharmazanov, a vice speaker of parliament, told Reuters.
Others praised him for not resorting to a bloody crackdown to stay in power, something he had hinted at on Sunday.
Sarksyan was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow is closely watching events in Armenia, where it has two military bases. The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was pleased the situation appeared stable for now.
Many experts say it is too early to predict what lies ahead however.

“What is needed is a sober power-sharing reconfiguration,” said Richard Giragosian, a director of the Regional Studies Centre.
“Yet such consensus and compromise seems very far away, and with mounting expectations and anger dangerously high, the real challenge of governance is only just beginning.”

APRIL 24, 2018 — Kuwait News Agency reports that Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) has signed a $167.6 million contract with South Korean shipbuilder Hyundai Mipo Dockyard covering the construction of four 48,000 dwt petroleum products tankers.
The first of the vessels will be delivered in February 2020 with deliveries of the others following by May 2020.
The orders are part of a major KOTC fleet overhaul that aims for a significant increase of the company's gas and petroleum products vessels based on the needs of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.
SHANGHAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - China's primary money rates fell this week as cash conditions were loose with few signs of liquidity stress, even after the central bank drained the most cash in nearly two years. The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 2.7424 percent on Friday afternoon. That is nearly 18 basis points lower than the previous week's closing average rate of 2.9194 percent. The People's Bank of China (PBOC), noting the banking system's "relatively high" levels of liquidity, has refrained from injecting cash via its open market operations for seven consecutive trading days, starting from Jan. 25. In that period, there's been a net drain of 1.15 trillion yuan ($183.46 billion) due to maturing repos, including 760 billion this week - the biggest weekly one since late February 2016. Traders said cash conditions were looser than expected, and the absence of reverse repos did not affect sentiment. Factors including the use of contingent reserve allowance (CRA), which lets some banks set aside fewer official reserves temporarily, has fueled the financial system with ample liquidity this week, according to traders. The PBOC said in late December it would let some commercial banks temporarily keep fewer required reserves to help them meet heavy cash demand ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. Gao Ting, head of China strategy at UBS Securities, said the loosened liquidity does not mean a change in the tone of financial regulation. "Money market rates will stay high ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday, with tighter liquidity for non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) than for banks, as regulators are curtailing the flow of credit from banks to NBFIs to limit leverage," Gao said in a note.

YORK, Pa. (AP) — When she walks onto a golf course as one of the few black women on the links, Sandra Harrison fills with pride and hopes her play will dispel stereotypes and disarm her fellow players — who are often white and male.
What she felt playing at the Grandview Golf Club as a new member in her community could not have been more opposite, Harrison said. The 59-year-old retiree said she was traumatized, rattled and hurt after she said she and the group of black women she was playing with were run off the course before police were called when a white man claimed the women were playing too slowly.
“It was like we were playing with targets on our backs,” Harrison said. “What other reason could there be other than we were guilty of being black while golfing?”
No charges were filed, but the confrontation Saturday touched a raw nerve after two other somewhat similar incidents. Two black men in Philadelphia were handcuffed and arrested on April 12 after a Starbucks employee called police because they hadn't bought anything in the store. And employees of an LA Fitness in New Jersey wrongly accused a black member and his guest of not paying to work out and called police, prompting an apology from the company.
Harrison and Sandra Thompson said they were at the second hole when representatives of the Grandview Golf Club told the group they were playing too slowly.
“We knew we snapped those balls and moved right ahead,” Thompson said in an interview with The Associated Press.
According to Thompson, one of the other women said she was confronted by a man with a posturing, aggressive demeanor who said, “You need to move forward! I'm the owner!”
Not wanting to lose the day, the group attempted to power through the front nine, Harrison said, but the confrontations made them increasingly upset and unable to concentrate on the game.
After the ninth hole, three of the women dropped out and headed home.
“I said, ‘I don't want to do this anymore,'” Harrison said. “I was traumatized.”
Down to two players, Thompson figured she and her partner could continue without being bothered. Again, they were approached.
The message this time: “Get off our property.” The women were informed the police had been called.
After they were questioned, police declined to proceed further. Thompson said she was offered a check refunding her membership, but refused.
On Sunday club co-owner JJ Chronister told the York Daily Record she called the women personally to “sincerely apologize.”
On Monday, she issued a second statement to the newspaper saying players who are slow typically leave the course when asked by club personnel.
“In this instance, the members refused to leave so we called police to ensure an amicable result,” the statement reads. It says the women skipped holes and took an extended break.
“During the second conversation we asked members to leave as per our policy noted on the scorecard, voices escalated, and police were called to ensure an amicable resolution,” it reads.
It's part of golf etiquette that slow-moving players let groups behind them play through if they are holding things up, and often golf courses have employees who monitor the pace of play, letting golfers know when they are taking too long.
The five are part of a larger group of local women known as Sisters in the Fairway. The group has been around for at least a decade, and all of its members are experienced players who have golfed all over the country and world. They're very familiar with golf etiquette.
“Our name implies that we want to live life in a fair way,” Harrison said. We want to be sisters in the fairway, in golf and in life.”
Normally, clubs don't allow groups larger than four. Sandra Thompson was the last member to arrive, and checked with a clerk to see if it was OK to join the four others, knowing a fifth member might be an issue. The clerk said it was fine, said Thompson, an attorney and president of the York branch of the NAACP.
Thompson posted a video on her Facebook page showing the interaction with club co-owner Jordan Chronister, his father, former York County Commissioner Steve Chronister, and several other white, male employees.
In it, Jordan Chronister tells the women he's been timing them and that they must leave the premises. The women respond that they took an appropriate break and that the men behind them were still on their beer break and not ready to tee off. The women are then told that the police have been called. And so they wait.
Northern York County Regional Police arrived, conducted interviews and left without charging anyone.
“We were called there for an issue, the issue did not warrant any charges,” Northern York County Regional Police Chief Mark Bentzel told the York Daily Record.
JJ Chronister, who owns the club with her husband Jordan Chronister, told the newspaper Sunday that she called the women personally to apologize. She said she hopes to meet with them to discuss how the club can use what happened as a learning experience and do better in the future.
RIO DE JANEIRO—At least 60 inmates died during a prison riot in the northern state of Amazonas, including several who were beheaded or dismembered, in the biggest killing at a Brazilian prison since 1992.Amazonas state public security secretary Sergio Fontes said that in addition to the deaths, some inmates escaped, but he did not say how many. He added that 40 had been recaptured.Twelve prison guards were held hostage by the inmates, though none were wounded.“This is the biggest prison massacre in our state's history,” Fontes said during a press conference. The riot at the Anisio Jobim Penitentiary Complex began Sunday afternoon and lasted until Monday morning.It was the largest death toll during a Brazilian prison riot since the killing of 111 inmates by police officers in the Carandiru penitentiary in São Paulo in 1992. Police said they acted in self-defence then.Article Continued BelowFontes confirmed that many of the dead had been beheaded and Judge Luis Carlos Valois, who negotiated the end of the riot with inmates, said he saw many bodies that were quartered.“I never saw anything like that in my life. All those bodies, the blood,” Valois wrote on Facebook.Authorities said the riot apparently grew out of a fight between two of the country's biggest crime gangs of the country over control of several prisons. Fontes said the inmates made few demands to end the riot, which hints at a killing spree organized by members of a local gang, the Family of the North, against those of the First Command of the Capital that is based in São Paulo.

There was a festive atmosphere at the San Diego Zoo's Panda Trek this morning (Sept. 7, 2017), as animal care staff and zoo volunteers threw a lavish party for giant panda Bai Yun's 26th birthday—celebrating the matriarch's life as an “ambassador of hope” for her species. The panda habitat was decorated with traditional red birthday envelopes stuffed with tasty treats, pillows packed with hay, a simple panda bread cake decorated with apple slices, and little goodie bags topped full of snacks—each with the names of Bai Yun's cubs written on the front.

Zoo guests watched as Bai Yun enthusiastically opened each of her present boxes and goodie bags, devouring all the treats inside. She also gobbled up every morsel of her panda bread cake, took a long drink of water and, after all that partying, decided to lie down for a well-earned nap. Panda keepers described the birthday bear as an energetic older animal, still curious and playful. They said she brings joy to anyone who visits her habitat and delights the crowds with her good-natured charm and grace.
“Bai Yun has been an amazing asset to our panda conservation program over the past two decades,” said Kathy Hawk, senior keeper at the San Diego Zoo. “Even though it's her 26th birthday, we wanted to let our guests know why she's here. Since she's been at the San Diego Zoo, we've learned a great deal about her and her species through her—including mother-infant relationships and overall panda biology. And for that we celebrate her.”
Bai Yun arrived at the San Diego Zoo in September 1996—just one year before the Zoo began its historic giant panda breeding program. She was the first giant panda to successfully give birth to surviving cubs in the United States—at a time when the species was on the brink of extinction. Since then, she has helped researchers and keepers learn much more about panda behavior, pregnancy, birth and maternal care.
Last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reclassified the giant panda as Vulnerable, instead of Endangered—indicating in their report that current conservation efforts are working; however, panda breeding and habitat loss remain a problem, so more work still needs to be done to grow the species and provide giant pandas with suitable places to thrive. Currently, scientists count nearly 2,000 giant pandas living in their native habitats—and the majority of them are adults.
The San Diego Zoo's giant pandas are on a research loan from the People's Republic of China. As part of this long-term program, the Zoo, in conjunction with Chinese panda experts, continues to work on science-based panda conservation programs. The Zoo also collaborates with the Chinese Academy of Sciences in studies of behavior, ecology, genetics and conservation of wild pandas.
To celebrate Bai Yun's birthday and help giant pandas worldwide, anyone can become a Hero for Wildlife and join San Diego Zoo Global in leading the fight against extinction. To find out how, visit the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy at endextinction.org.
Bringing species back from the brink of extinction is the goal of San Diego Zoo Global. As a leader in conservation, the work of San Diego Zoo Global includes on-site wildlife conservation efforts (representing both plants and animals) at the San Diego Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, and San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research, as well as international field programs on six continents. The work of these entities is inspiring children through the San Diego Zoo Kids network, reaching out through the internet and in children's hospitals nationwide. The work of San Diego Zoo Global is made possible by the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy and is supported in part by the Foundation of San Diego Zoo Global.

How Electronic Execution Platforms are Revolutionising Trading
When it comes to the financial industry, electronic execution platforms in the way of trading refer to any computer software program that can be used for placing orders and trading over a network. These transactions and orders usually include stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives with a financial intermediary such as a stock exchange, broker or investment bank and all of this can be done through electronic trading from any location.
With the speed in which the financial markets are changing, it could be well worth keeping up with electronic execution platforms with leading companies in the industry providing the latest updates on the industry. But are electronic execution platforms actually having a revolutionary effect on trading?
Ease and Agility
Electronic execution platforms are having an important effect on financial markets and just how efficient they are. Computerising trading platforms means a faster, more accurate and agile system that can ultimately allow businesses and financial institutions to do more in a shorter amount of time.
Large amounts of information around the trading of a business can be processed simultaneously, increasing operational efficiency, and ultimately, the efficiency and productivity of a business as a whole. With this speed also comes ease.
With a little knowledge or training of how the systems work, electronic execution platforms can make trading more and more accessible to people of all skill types and levels no matter where they are on the globe.
Transparency
With electronic execution platforms comes more transparency within trading, which can ultimately mean safer, and well-assessed risk management. Relationships between businesses can be built more securely when the marketplace is becoming more transparent, though there is still plenty of way to go when it comes to transparency within trading.
Some electronic execution platforms open the markets up to transparency all while keeping some kind of anonymity within transactions. Competition is healthy in the financial markets, and lower costs and increased transparency will put pressure onto dealers which will push them into action, ultimately improving the financial trading markets and making for quite the interesting market to watch. Add in the aforementioned ease and agility, and electronic execution platforms can offer a greater scale of transparency within trade transactions.
Stability
Financial stability within the financial markets hugely depends on the efficiency, liquidity, orderliness and resilience of the market at any time. Electronic execution platforms could very well impact all of these in some way.
With the financial industry in a period of instability due to the constantly changing state of the world, it's more important than ever to seek out ways to remain financially stable, and that's exactly what financial institutions are doing. Electronic execution platforms can help a business ride out any fluctuations in the markets, and in some cases, the platform you use could very well do this for you by making it clearer what your options are, what the risks are, and make it easier for a financial institution to then go and make the changes they need to, to ensure their business remains financially stable.
What's in a (university building) name?
Influential people in a university's history — a founder, a major donor — often have the honor of having a building, department or other prominent feature on campus named for them.
But a look into the histories of the namesakes of buildings around many college campuses in America reveal ties to white supremacy and slavery. And in the modern era, those ties are increasingly seen as problematic.
At some schools, students and faculty are holding their universities accountable for their racial history by demanding their universities change the names of the buildings that honor those who advocated for and benefited from systems of white supremacy, slavery and systemic racism.
The newest example: Yale University. After a renewed push in 2015 by students to have a building name changed, Yale University announced Friday it is renaming one of its residential colleges named in honor of former U.S. vice president and white supremacist John C. Calhoun, who was a prominent proponent of slavery.
Nick Girard, a Yale sophomore, pointed out that the Calhoun name change “is the result of decades of activism and action” by students and faculty. “It is excellent to see the university finally recognize this continued activism and listen to the students, alumni and professors who have protested Yale's honoring a renowned supporter of slavery,” Girard told USA TODAY College.
Girard explained the tireless work it took for the change to happen. “So many invested academic, emotional, and mental labor in fighting to make a better, more inclusive Yale,” he said.
Students & local activists rallying against Yale's Calhoun College, shouting "change the name." #wfsb pic.twitter.com/iyCs0xNYRN — Matt McFarland (@MattMcFarland3) October 28, 2016
The decision to rename Calhoun College was not always on the table. As recently as last April, Yale president Peter Salovey said the name of the building would not be changed. But by August, he had announced a committee to explore renaming the building. The committee developed a set of principles to use when considering name changes, and the board voted to rename Calhoun College on Friday.
“John C. Calhoun's legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a ‘positive good' fundamentally conflicts with Yale's mission and values,” Salovey said in a post on the Yale website.
The post also mentions that it followed guidance from schools like Georgetown that have recently changed building names on their campus.
In 2015, Georgetown president John DeGioia announced that the university would be renaming two buildings on campus that were named for two university presidents who had authorized and advised the sale of slaves to pay off campus debts. Mulledy and McSherry halls were both renamed at the suggestion of the working group on slavery, memory and reconciliation, a panel of Georgetown students, administrators and faculty. Students had lobbied the university for the building name changes.
While schools like Yale and Georgetown have taken steps to address their ties with slavery, there is still an uphill battle being fought at others.
At Clemson and Winthrop universities in South Carolina, students and faculty have called for buildings on their campuses named Tillman Hall to be changed and have been at the center of contentious debates over the renaming efforts.
The buildings' names honor Benjamin Ryan Tillman, a former governor of the state and an avowed white supremacist. Tillman was a vocal proponent of lynching.
Last fall, Winthrop students held a sit-in to enter talks with administration about the renaming efforts and to remind the campus who Tillman was.
Many students believe having Tillman's name being attached to a prominent building on campus doesn't reflect the university they attend today.
“It sort of invalidates and nullifies all of the student activities and engagement that happen in this building because most of the activities in this building are headed by students of color,” Winthrop student Candace Livingston told USA TODAY College. Livingston pointed to events hosted at Tillman Hall as one example of how off-putting it can be for students of color “to be in a building named after a man that could care less about our bodies.”
In 2015, Clemson's faculty senate and the graduate student government both voted to rename Tillman Hall — a symbolic gesture, because only Clemson's board of trustees can officially change the name of a building on campus.
In February 2015, Clemson University board of trustees chair David H. Wilkins announced in a statement that they would not rename the building, citing that whether the name of the building was changed Tillman would still remain a part of Clemson's history:
“Every great institution is built by imperfect craftsmen. Stone by stone they add to the foundation so that over many, many generations, we get a variety of stones. And so it is with Clemson. Some of our historical stones are rough and even unpleasant to look at. But they are ours and denying them as part of our history does not make them any less so. For that reason, we will not change the name of our historical buildings. Part of knowledge is to know and understand history so you learn from it.”
Ongoing efforts to change the names of both Tillman Halls face strenuous challenges. South Carolina's Heritage Act says that any street, park or plaque named for a historical figure in the state cannot be renamed without a two-thirds vote from the state General Assembly.
But Winthrop students aren't backing down from the fight to have the building's name changed on their campus. They've begun planning a letter-writing campaign and have engaged in other conversations with university officials to advance their fight to change the name of Tillman Hall.

The mega-rich deserve just a bit of our sympathy.
At least, that's the idea underpinning “Succession,” the new drama created by comedy writer Jesse Armstrong (the U.K.'s “Peep Show”) and executive produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay (the Oscar-winning writer and director of “The Big Short”). The show assays Logan Roy (Brian Cox), the Scottish-born head of media and entertainment conglomerate Waystar Royco, and his four children, sharp-elbowed beasts, all of whom aren't content merely with being wealthy. They want a bit of the power that Logan is unwilling to cede, and their inability to wrest it from him is both comic and, in moments, tragic.
Any resemblances to a certain other foreign-born media magnate are likely no coincidence. (Armstrong is the author of an unproduced screenplay titled Murdoch.) But the family dynamic, at least, feels original. Along with a hippie-ish son from a first marriage (Alan Ruck, neglected by his family but given some of the best material by his show), the Roys comprise Kendall (Jeremy Strong), reasserting his birthright as a corporate superstar after having been derailed by addiction; Roman (Kieran Culkin), who hides sharp ambition behind diffident, dissolute wit; and Siobhan (Sarah Snook), striking out on her own as a political consultant but still entangled in the family's drama. That drama comes fast and furious, as the show transpires largely in the wake of a medical incident that sidelines Logan, even as he remains the head of a corporation that more closely resembles a cult of personality.
The show's strengths and weaknesses come hand-in-hand; its pulpy willingness to be its silliest self can be great fun, but can also transport a show that often tries to say something real about the hazards of generational wealth into too-easy comedy, or fantasy. I admit I rolled my eyes whenever someone referred to Siobhan by her family nickname, “Shiv.” (It's too on the nose for a sharp competitor who plays by prison-yard rules.) And Roman is a character of whom we likely see more than we need; his relentless bon mots begin to feel curdled after a while. The point, that a certain kind of blase, seen-it-all rich kid can too easily confuse cruelty for wit, is amply made. But others of the family's interactions are stilted in a manner that serves the show. That no character seems to understand how to talk to any other makes sense; their discomfort with one another is the result of a climate of mutual suspicion and antipathy.
Generally, though, the show delivers on its promise of soapy interactions between family members for whom money has complicated everything. Kendall holds his siblings — his competitors — at arm's length, while Siobhan's impending marriage to a fast-climbing Waystar executive (Matthew Macfadyen, a sleazy standout) is haunted by the question of whether it's a love match or a mutually beneficial corporate merger. Aspects of the show play a bit like the high-finance camp of Showtime's “Billions,” but reinterpreted through HBO's prestige-y filter; the show has the skittering camera movements and the pounding, inescapable score of a show with greater ambitions than just documenting one clan's ludicrous devotion to making one another unhappy.
“Succession,” indeed, is at its best, and its most purely enjoyable, when it pushes past the temptation to be fun alone. The leonine Cox, for instance, sets a tone of family ferocity that's engaging because it's great, not just indulgent. Each family member follows his lead in their own deranged way, particularly Macfadyen, who brings into each scene an aura of menace and the stench of impostor's flop sweat. This show's core audience, those who thrill to the misdeeds of the powerful, is likely to find and embrace it, as “Billions'” has. But I wish this season had delivered a bit more nourishment at the banquet. One thread, not yet fully developed, involves Roy's control of his assets' political messaging; we see protesters raging against the dissension he sows and a bit of his own hard-right views. I craved a further sense of what it means to have his kind of power — and why the succession matters for all of us, for reasons beyond which character gets to lord over the rest.
What we see of the Roys' power tends to come through their interactions with functionaries and underlings, whom they boss around and maltreat in ways that bring to mind how thrilling and how wearying “Game of Thrones” would be if it only featured the Lannisters. In the first episode, at a family softball game, Roman offers the gamekeeper's young son a million-dollar check should he make a home run; once he's tagged out by the adults, the scion tears the check up in front of him. It's not easy being rich, sure, but it's a lot easier than not being rich — or than caring about the travails of the wealthy, spoiled, and ultimately unpleasant.

An audit of Domino's Pizza franchisees and a probe into individual complaints has so far recovered $1.1 billion in unpaid wages and super.
Domino's Pizza says it has recovered $1.1 billion in unpaid wages and superannuation from its probe into staff complaints and an audit of stores across Australia.
The pizza chain says it has so far recovered $770,000 in unpaid wages and superannuation from its completed audit of 15 stores, and ongoing audit of another 41 stores.
It has also recovered $249,000 in wages and super after investigating 55 individual complaints, while another 19 complaints are still being looked into.
Three Domino's franchisees, who operated a total of six stores, are no longer part of the business.
Domino's said it is withholding a total of $487,000 for wage back-payments at those six stores.
Chief executive Don Meij, who opted to forgo a cash bonus of over $500,000 because of the underpayments scandal, said the audit was taking longer than originally expected, and will take another five months.
He said the Fairwork Ombudsman, which is also investigating Domino's franchisees over allegations of staff underpayments, has issued notices to the company and some franchisees.
"There has been a small number of franchisees who have been cleared," Mr Meij said.
"We don't have the full report from the Fairwork Ombudsman and are still working with them on their review."
Allegations of staff underpayments were first raised in February, and have weighed on the company's share price as analysts raised concerns about the profitability of franchisees.
Mr Meij attempted to address those concerns on Tuesday as he presented the company's 25 per cent annual profit growth in the 2016/17 year.
"In a high inflationary wage environment, profitability for franchisees have increased by over 25 per cent in the past two years," he said.
Domino's will increase staff wages in the first half of the current financial year while it continues to negotiate a new enterprise bargaining agreement with the retail workers union.
Mr Meij chose to forgo his short-term cash bonus in the 2016/17 financial year because of the "negative effect" of the publicity of underpayments by franchisees.
But his total remuneration of $4.66 million was still nearly 17 per cent higher than the previous year's, due to an increase in share-based payments.
An inmate who attempted suicide in his cell at the Ottawa jail last week has died in hospital, the third suicide at the detention centre in the past 10 months.
It marks an alarming increase for the jail. Statistics on the number of suicides or attempted suicides in the jail are difficult to obtain, but the ministry said during a coroner's inquest in 2014 that there had only been two suicides in the jail — in 2005 and 2011 — in the previous decade. The ministry also reported there were 47 attempted suicides over that same time frame, the last date for which statistics were available.
Cleve Geddes, 30, of Killaloe hanged himself in his cell on Feb. 8. Geddes was being housed in protective custody in an area of the jail known as the pods, according to the president of the union that represents correctional officers at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre.
He is the third inmate to kill himself at the jail since April. Two others, Yousef Hussein, 27, and Justin St-Amour, 32, also hanged themselves in their cells. Geddes was taken to hospital where he was being treated in the intensive care unit before dying on Friday.
“We need to look at each of these cases and see what is the common factor here that can be addressed,” said Dr. A.G. Ahmed, the associate chief of the integrated forensic program at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre. “Whatever it is, it is not acceptable to have three people die in 10 months by suicide.”
One correctional officer, who can't be named as he was not authorized to speak publicly, said Geddes had been on a suicide watch earlier in the week but had been removed from it before hanging himself. Multiple sources have also told the Citizen that Geddes appeared to be mentally ill.
Both Hussein and St-Amour had also been on a suicide watch but were removed prior to hanging themselves. Inmates on suicide watch are supposed to be checked every 10 minutes, as opposed to every 20 minutes for inmates who are not on suicide watch.
“We need to make sure we up our game to make sure everybody is assessed,” said Ahmed, a psychiatrist who treats inmates at the detention centre.
The ministry of community safety and correctional services said a suicide watch can only be removed or downgraded by a psychiatrist, primary care physician or registered psychologist following an in-person assessment of the inmate.
From the time of identification of suicide risk, an inmate would receive additional supervision until further assessment deems the risk no longer exists, the ministry said.
The minister in charge of jails, Orléans MPP Marie-France Lalonde, was touring the jail in Thunder Bay Tuesday and wasn't available for an interview.
However, in an emailed statement, she said one of her “top priorities” is the safety and security of all inmates and staff. Lalonde said she is “especially concerned about the recent deaths at the OCDC.
“I am committed to ensuring that our institutions are providing appropriate care to inmates in need,” the emailed statement said. “When there is a death in one of our institutions, an investigation takes place to ensure that policies and procedures were followed. If an investigation or a coroner's inquest determines that policies were not followed, or that policies need updating, action is taken,” the statement said.
To date, the ministry of community safety and correctional services, which oversees the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre, wouldn't even acknowledge the latest death as a suicide, instead describing it simply as a “medical distress.”
“The Office of the Chief Coroner conducts death investigations in Ontario and would determine the cause of death. It would not be appropriate for the government to determine the cause prior to the Coroner's investigation,” said the ministry in an emailed statement.
According to the ministry, there are “standing protocols” for dealing with inmates identified as being at risk for suicide.
“An inmate is evaluated for suicide risk indicators upon admission to the institution and throughout their incarceration and may be considered to be at risk for suicide through the results of the screening tool, or the opinion of correctional staff, a notification from an external source or in the professional opinion of a clinician,” the ministry said. “The institution's administration and health care team are notified without delay of an inmate who may be at risk of suicide and a clinician would see the inmate within 24 hours.
“Reassessment of an inmate considered at risk of suicide occurs daily by clinical staff. Staff monitoring and observations, heath care assessments, as well as treatment and support provisions are provided including professional counselling and where deemed appropriate cultural and spiritual supports,” the ministry said.
Ahmed said he believes the ministry has been doing a much better job in the past year of identifying and responding to individuals who are actively mentally ill.
However, Ahmed suggested the jail conduct a quality of care review in relation to the three latest suicides to determine what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. He also thinks it should review staffing levels and ensure that the amount of nursing is adequate.
“Predicting suicide is not 100 per cent exercise,” said Ahmed.
The ministry recently touted the creation of interim “step-down units” for up to 16 inmates with mental illness. The dedicated units are intended for inmates with mental health care needs to access the same privileges as regular inmates, such as time out of their cell, fresh air, phones, showers, television and access to programming while they transition back to the general population.
The ministry is currently in the design phase of creating permanent mental health and step-down units, but construction on This has yet to begin. The ministry said it is also developing programming for suicide and self-injury prevention.
But Denis Collin, the head of the union representing correctional officers, questioned last week whether the ministry was doing enough to address mental health care within the jail. He worried the ministry was only coming up with a “Band-Aid” solution.
Geddes was arrested by Ontario Provincial Police in Barry's Bay on Jan. 30. Geddes had been charged with three counts of uttering threats as well as assaulting a peace officer and resisting arrest.
Attempts to reach his family were unsuccessful Tuesday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Brazil international and former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Paulinho will travel to Spain to complete a move to Barcelona on Sunday after the Catalan club activated the Guangzhou Evergrande player's buy-out clause, Chinese media reported.
Barça, who need reinforcements after the world record transfer of Brazil forward Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain last week, will pay the 40 million euros ($47.26 million) for the 29-year-old to end his two-year spell in the Chinese Super League.
Barcelona were not immediately available to comment.
Paulinho had recently been linked with a move to the Spanish side but Guangzhou chairman Xu Jiayin had denied that the former Corinthians midfielder would be sold before the end of the season after rejecting two previous bids.
Xu said the cost of replacing Paulinho, who signed a new deal this year, would make it impossible for Guangzhou to part with a player instrumental in their charge to the top of the table and run to the Asian Champions League quarter-finals.
Paulinho joined Guangzhou after a disappointing spell in the English Premier League with Spurs and has established himself as a key player for his Chinese club and his country.
In March got a hat-trick as Brazil handed Uruguay a 4-1 defeat in a World Cup qualifier, while he has scored seven goals in the Chinese league and five in the Asian Champions League.

LONDON—Sajad Jamalvatan was at the movies Tuesday night when he got a call from his panicked mother. Come home quickly, she begged. “The building is on fire!” she said. A few minutes later, the 22-year-old biomedical engineering student rounded the corner to see Grenfell Tower transforming into an inferno. “As soon as I arrived, someone pointed and said, ‘Someone is jumping! Someone is jumping!'” he recounted on Wednesday with the smell of smoke lingering in the air. He estimated the person jumped from the 16th or 17th floor of the 24-floor tower. That kind of fall is not the kind you can survive. The number of dead touched at least 12 — with dozens more injured and authorities warning the death toll could rise.

“Seeing people die in front of you ...” he said as his voice trailed off and he stared hard at the sidewalk. He said the blaze had advanced quickly, and that the alarms did not appear to have been triggered.
“When I arrived, there were 10 flats on fire. After that, the whole building was on fire,” he said. He snapped his fingers. “It went like that,” he said. Accounts such as his quickly added to suspicions that the material used in the 24-story building could have contributed to the fast-moving blaze at an enclave of modest-priced units in one of Britain's richest neighbourhoods. The residents' association from the tower block had previously warned the tower was a potential fire risk — they highlighted their concerns in a blog post last year — and there was palpable anger on the streets that more could have been done to prevent the fire. Some complained the fire alarms didn't work properly. Others said the staircase in the middle of the building was inadequate. Still others claimed that those who managed the building did things on the cheap. The London Fire Brigade called the fire “unprecedented,” and said an investigation was underway.
At a nearby community centre, meanwhile, hundreds gathered in hopes of locating missing friends and relatives — including some Muslim residents who were gathered for the evening meals during the holy month of Ramadan. Concerned locals also arrived in droves, many carrying plastic shopping bags sagging with food, diapers, toiletries and blankets. One man pushed a baby stroller teetering with water, milk and cans of baked beans. Ahmed Chellat, 60, a retired community worker, was at a community centre looking for his brother-in-law, his wife, and their three children who lived on the 21st floor of the tower. He said he spoke to his brother-in-law's wife at 1:45 a.m. and that she was told to stay put. When he asked her why they weren't instead rushing out of the building, she told him: “They are telling us to stay in — they're asking us to cover doors with towels. But fire is coming heavily,” he recalled. When he called back 30 minutes later, “the last thing she said was. ‘Smoke was coming heavily into flat.'” “If the emergency services tell them to stay inside, it means you are coming to get them. Did they? These are big questions,” he said. Many residents said the building had recently been refurbished and fitted with plastic panels that they believed helped the fire to spread quickly. “You could hear it cracking. Hear it flying. If it was brick it would not have caught fire as quickly,” said Chellat. In similar fires elsewhere around the world, flammable exterior cladding has been blamed for several rapid fires at highrises — including several blazes among Dubai's many skyscrapers.

Just before New Year's celebrations to welcome 2016, a fire raced through the 63-story Address hotel in Dubai as millions of people watched television coverage of the festivities at the nearby Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. A handful of people suffered injuries in the fire. In January, Dubai civil defence authorities ordered new fire safety regulations that include fire-resistant cladding and other measures. Mohamed Bouye, a 44-year-old manager, was touring the local community centres in London trying to find his friend from the 18th floor of the tower. “No word, no answer. So yeah ...” he said, as police began putting up a security cordon next to him. He watched the fire burn throughout the night. When he first arrived at the tower, shortly after 1 a.m., it looked as if the fire could be contained to one section of the building. He said he even saw one man casually leaning over the railing of the building, like there was no imminent danger. But things changed quickly. “The flames went from the 9th floor to the 27th floor in 10 minutes,” he said. “There were then screams. ‘Help us!' I saw two people jump, two bodies flying down, they were between floors 10 and 15. Other people told me they saw people jumping from the other side of the building.” Christine Umeh, 35, was woken up at about 3 a.m. by the whirring of helicopters, which continued on throughout the day on Wednesday. When she looked outside of her building, which faces the tower, saw helpless residents on the top floors flicking their lights on and off, on and off. “It's like they were saying, ‘Just help me. I'm here. Try to help me,'” she said, as she pushed her 21-month-old daughter back-and-forth in her stroller. “It was like an SOS signal.”
Michael Eric Dyson on white supremacism
Posted on August 14, 2017 by Fred Allebach
The following article by Michael Eric Dyson is cut and pasted from the New York Times Opinon section. The opinion was so good, I feel called to re-post it. Add the situation spoken of below to the Trump nativist immigration orders and nationwide abuse of immigrants, and it is clear the US is losing its moral rudder. Everything Trump does and says fuels me to resist more. I'm incensed by Trump and have never felt so energized to fight the power as I do now. I hope politicians realize that the time for candy-coated mediocrity is way over. Come the next election, those who stand up to the full house of abuses by Trump et al will be the ones who get elected. Be warned. As Dyson calls for, the time for actively speaking out is now.
Charlottesville and the Bigotocracy
Michael Eric Dyson AUG. 12, 2017
The late, great Gore Vidal said that we live in “The United States of Amnesia.” Our fatal forgetfulness flares when white bigots come out of their closets, emboldened by the tacit cover they're given by our president. We cannot pretend that the ugly bigotry unleashed in the streets of Charlottesville, Va., this weekend has nothing to do with the election of Donald Trump.
In attendance was white separatist David Duke, who declared that the alt-right unity fiasco “fulfills the promises of Donald Trump.” In the meantime, Mr. Trump responded by offering false equivalencies between white bigots and their protesters. His soft denunciations of hate ring hollow when he has white nationalist advisers like Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller whispering in his ear.
Such an ungainly assembly of white supremacists rides herd on political memory. Their resentment of the removal of public symbols of the Confederate past — the genesis of this weekend's rally — is fueled by revisionist history. They fancy themselves the victims of the so-called politically correct assault on American democracy, a false narrative that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory. Each feeds on the same demented lies about race and justice that corrupt true democracy and erode real liberty. Together they constitute the repulsive resurgence of a virulent bigotocracy.
This bigotocracy overlooks fundamental facts about slavery in this country: that blacks were stolen from their African homeland to toil for no wages in American dirt. When black folk and others point that out, white bigots are aggrieved. They are especially offended when it is argued that slavery changed clothes during Reconstruction and got dressed up as freedom, only to keep menacing black folk as it did during Jim Crow. The bigotocracy is angry that slavery is seen as this nation's original sin. And yet they remain depressingly and purposefully ignorant of what slavery was, how it happened, what it did to us, how it shaped race and the air and space between white and black folk, and the life and arc of white and black cultures.
They cling to a faded Southern aristocracy whose benefits — of alleged white superiority, and moral and intellectual supremacy — trickled down to ordinary whites. If they couldn't drink from the cup of economic advantage that white elites tasted, at least they could sip what was left of a hateful ideology: at least they weren't black. The renowned scholar W.E.B. Du Bois called this alleged sense of superiority the psychic wages of whiteness. President Lyndon Baines Johnson once argued, “If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.”
We have a bigoted billionaire-cum-president who has done precious little for the white working class whose resentment fueled his rise. They have emptied their ethical and economic pockets in support of him even though he turned his back on them the moment he entered the Oval Office. The only remnant of his leadership they have to hold on to is the folklore of white nationalist sentiment, and xenophobic passion, that offer them psychic comfort if little financial stability.
It is disheartening for black folk to see such a vile and despicable replay of history. Facing this unadorned hate tears open wounds from atrocities that we have confronted throughout our history. It is depressing to explain to our children that what we confronted as children may be the legacy they bequeath to their children as well.
It is more dispiriting still to realize that the government of our land, at least in the present administration, has shown little empathy toward victims of white bigotry, and indeed, has helped to spread the paralyzing virus of hatred, by turning a blind eye to what is done in their name.
Now is the time for every decent white American to prove he or she loves this country by actively speaking out against the scourge this bigotocracy represents. If such heinous behavior is met by white silence, it will only cement the perception that as long as most white folk are not immediately at risk, then all is relatively well. Yet nothing could be further from the truth, and nothing could more clearly declare the moral bankruptcy of our country.

CLEVELAND -- Never mind that the Cleveland Cavaliers nearly blew another late double-digit lead in their 117-111 Game 2 victory over the Indiana Pacers to go up 2-0 in their Eastern Conference first-round series.
LeBron James says the defending-champion Cavs are on the brink of putting it all together.
"We're right there," James said after putting up 25 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists on Monday. "We're right there of what we know we can become, and we'll figure it out. So, like I told you, I'd much rather have an 18-point lead than not have a lead at all. And we make plays down the stretch to win a ball game in the postseason, and that's all you can ask for. But we're right there on turning the switch on what we really can become."

Cleveland came into the fourth quarter with an 18-point lead and saw the Pacers cut it all the way to four with 19.5 seconds remaining, reminiscent of the way Indiana was able to turn a 12-point deficit late in the third quarter in Game 1 to a two-point lead with 3:31 remaining in the fourth Saturday.
James affirmed he's playing with an elevated level of confidence even with the No. 2 seed Cavs in such a close series with the No. 7 Pacers, in which Cleveland has won by a total of seven points on its home court through the first two games.
"Because we're playing some really, really good basketball," James said. "Even in, you know, the first two quarters, we build a lead, we didn't close out the second quarter as well as we would like to and, but, we have a chance. We have a chance to do something we all have been wanting to do all season, and that's to put together a four-quarter game. And I think we're right there on the cusp of doing that."
At the very least, James had ample reason to feel good about the Cavs on the offensive end. James, Kyrie Irving (37 points) and Kevin Love (27 points), combined for the most points they've ever had in a postseason game together (89 points). It was also the first time three Cleveland teammates all scored 25 or more in a playoff game.
The Cavs also shot 55.2 percent from the field as a team (41.9 percent from 3) and went 20-for-23 from the foul line (87.0 percent) after making just 14 of 27 free throws in Game 1.
Monday was the 19th straight first-round playoff game that James has won, dating back to May 2012 when his Miami Heat lost to the New York Knicks. Even though his confidence was high, he did not wish to speculate about Indiana's confidence, or lack thereof, after two near misses in Cleveland.
"Well that's not our mindset," James said. "Our mindset is what we can do to help each other to be successful out on the floor. We have a game plan from our coaching staff and we just try to execute that. We can't worry about what the opponent is feeling or if they feel like they lost composure. That's not our mindset, Our mindset is what can we do this defensive possession to get a stop. Offensively what we can do to get a bucket. And if we can follow that game plan for as close to 48 minutes as possible, then nine times out of 10 we can be successful."

Lake Buena Vista, Fla. — Now slugging for the Bronx Bombers, Giancarlo Stanton.
The New York Yankees announced Monday they'd acquired Stanton from the Miami Marlins, getting the NL MVP and cash from Miami for Starlin Castro and two minor leaguers, right-hander Jorge Guzman and infielder Jose Devers.
Stanton was to be introduced later in the day at Major League Baseball's winter meetings.
The 28-year-old outfielder is still owed $295 million over the final decade of his record $325 million, 13-year contract.
The Marlins, with former Yankees star Derek Jeter as their new CEO, are expected to send $30 million to the Yankees if Stanton doesn't exercise his right to opt out of his contract and become a free agent after the 2020 season.
Stanton led the majors with 59 home runs and 132 RBIs last season. Once he puts on the pinstripes, Stanton will pair with Aaron Judge, the 6-foot-7 rookie who was second in the majors with 52 homers.
The Yankees topped baseball with 241 home runs last season. The prospect of the daunting duo together in the lineup — and putting on batting practice shows — raised thoughts of their previous powerful 1-2 punches, such as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, along with Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.
Shortly after the Yankees and Marlins agreed to the deal last weekend, Judge, the unanimous AL Rookie of the Year, sent a tweet to Stanton showing a clip from the movie “Step Brothers” with Will Ferrell saying, “Did we just become best friends?”
The Yankees came within one win of the World Series in October, losing the final two games of the AL Championship Series at Houston. The deal is sure to get a legion of fans that already dislike the Yanks railing against Jeter sending Stanton to his old team.
Stanton had a no-trade clause in his contract and last week turned down prospective deals to St. Louis and San Francisco. There was speculation he wanted to play close to home with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but clearly the Yankees were to his liking.
The Yankees haven't had a losing record since 1992. The Marlins haven't had a winning season since Stanton made his big league debut for them in 2010.
Jeter is expected to reduce payroll by at least 20 percent to $90 million or less. The Marlins shed $38 million of salary through 2020 by trading two-time All-Star second baseman Dee Gordon to Seattle last week for three prospects.
Castro is due $10 million in 2018 and $11 million in 2019, plus a $16 million club option for 2020 with a $1 million buyout.
The Yankees' payroll for purposes of baseball's luxury tax was about $209 million this year, and owner Hal Steinbrenner has vowed to reduce it below next year's $197 million threshold, which would reset the team's base tax rate from 50 percent to 20 percent in 2019. That would put the Yankees, under new manager Aaron Boone, in better position for next offseason's free agent class, which includes Bryce Harper, Manny Machado and possibly Clayton Kershaw.
The 27-year-old Castro was an All-Star last season, hitting .300 with 16 homers and 63 RBIs. There's speculation the Marlins will try to trade him to the New York Mets.
The 21-year-old Guzman was 5-3 with a 2.30 ERA in Class A Staten Island. The 18-year-old Devers hit .245 in the Dominican Summer League and the rookie Gulf Coast League.

Tom Duffy, an industry veteran with more than three decades of experience, has joined the Global Market Development Center (GMDC) as its new VP of member development. His role will focus primarily on expanding the association's reach within the retail and consumer product industry in order to create “the best global network” of those in the health, beauty, wellness and general merchandise value chain.
Duffy most recently served as EVP of industry affairs at Acosta, a sales and marketing agency in the consumer packaged goods industry, where as a member of the executive leadership team, he was responsible for marketing, communications and industry affairs initiatives.
Prior to that, Duffy was VP of industry services at Nielsen, global information and measurement company, where he was responsible for development of client, partner and industry relations, trade strategy and thought leadership development for 10 years.
Duffy has been involved with GMDC through the years, serving as co-chair of the association's education leadership council, where he was the architect of the GMDC-exclusive GM hierarchy benchmarking initiative—a partnership with Nielsen and Retail Insights that was launched in 2012 to offer members a standardized and detailed look into the $202 billion GM industry. The platform showcases 18 major categories including apparel, baby, candy, and housewares with hundreds of sub-categories. The Nielsen coded data, which is reported from thousands of stores across the North American market, can be filtered by various channels for comparison, and includes more than 20 million SKUs. As an enhanced benefit to GMDC members, an interactive dashboard version of the tool was launched earlier this year.
“Tom is a visionary in the industry and has served as a valued member of GMDC, helping chart the future for our association through leading-edge initiatives like our Nielsen hierarchy platform that spotlights tomorrow's trends today,” said Patrick Spear, president and CEO of GMDC. “He has a proven track record of cultivating relationships and creating innovative ‘go-to-market' strategies that drive market share and brand loyalty with key audiences, influencers and industry communities. We are thrilled to have Tom on our team of thought leaders.”
From 2004-2007, Duffy served as director of business and industry partnership of TDLinkx, a division of Nielsen. He also was director of marketing for FulTilt Solutions, a commercial software development company, and VP of marketing and administration for UCCnet, a tech start-up.
“It's a privilege to join GMDC,” Duffy said. “The association has a rich legacy of driving tremendous value for members and partners for nearly 50 years, and I am excited to join this extremely professional, creative and talented team. I am eager to help leverage GMDC's vision for future growth and expansion on behalf of our member community.”
Duffy has been active in speaking and has written numerous columns and white papers throughout his career. He received a bachelor's degree in accounting and business administration from Rutgers University.

PARIS-A computer was better than human dermatologists at detecting skin cancer in a study that pitted human against machine in the quest for better, faster diagnostics, researchers said Tuesday.
A team from Germany, the United States and France taught an artificial intelligence system to distinguish dangerous skin lesions from benign ones, showing it more than 100,000 images. The machine - a deep learning convolutional neural network or CNN - was then tested against 58 dermatologists from 17 countries, shown photos of malignant melanomas and benign moles.
Just over half the dermatologists were at “expert” level with more than five years of experience, 19 percent had between two and five years' experience, and 29 percent were beginners with less than two years under their belt.
“Most dermatologists were outperformed by the CNN,” the research team wrote in a paper published in the journal Annals of Oncology.
On average, flesh and blood dermatologists accurately detected 86.6 percent of skin cancers from the images, compared to 95 percent for the CNN.
“The CNN missed fewer melanomas, meaning it had a higher sensitivity than the dermatologists,” the study's first author Holger Haenssle of the University of Heidelberg said in a statement. It also “misdiagnosed fewer benign moles as malignant melanoma... this would result in less unneccessary surgery.” The dermatologists' performance improved when they were given more information of the patients and their skin lesions.
The team said AI may be a useful tool for faster, easier diagnosis of skin cancer, allowing surgical removal before it spreads. There are about 232,000 new cases of melanoma, and 55,500 deaths, in the world each year, they added. But it is unlikely that a machine will take over from human doctors entirely, rather functioning as an aid.
Melanoma in some parts of the body, such as the fingers, toes and scalp, are difficult to image, and AI may have difficulty recognising “atypical” lesions or ones that patients themselves are unaware of.
“Currently, there is no substitute for a thorough clinical examination,” experts Victoria Mar from Monash University in Melbourne and Peter Soyer of the University of Queensland wrote in an editorial published with the study.
Hours after returning to Twitter to apologize to the “hundreds of people and wonderful writers and talented actors who lost their jobs,” Roseanne Barr changed course by slamming some of her ABC sitcom costars. The comedian responded negatively to tweets by Michael Fisher and Sara Gilbert condemning her behavior that led to the cancellation of ABC's “Roseanne” revival. The series was pulled from ABC shortly after Barr made a racist joke referring to former Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett as a mix between the “Muslim Brotherhood” and the “Planet of the Apes.”

Fisher responded to Barr's joke and the show's cancellation by releasing a statement to his Twitter page in which he expressed sorrow for the many “Roseanne” workers who lost their jobs. The actor said he “condemned” Barr's joke “vehemently,” calling it “reprehensible and intolerable.” Fisher said the joke did not reflect the inclusive views of himself or his “Roseanne” character.
“I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it,” Barr fired back at Fishman on Twitter. “You throw me under the bus. Nice!”
Gilbert, meanwhile, issued a statement after Barr's joke went viral. The actress and “The Talk” cohost said, “Roseanne's recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show.” Gilbert then expressed disappointment in Barr's actions. Barr responded: “Wow! Unreal.”
Barr's comments to her costars differ from the statements she made hours earlier. Breaking her silence after the show's cancellation, Barr apologized to the hundreds of people she put out of work due to her racist tweet. She urged her fans not to defend her and admitted she “did something unforgivable” and “made a mistake.” The comedian was feeling a bit more antagonistic hours later when responding to Fishman and Gilbert.

Legal practitioner, Anthony Namoo
Mr Anthony Namoo, a legal practitioner, polled 124 votes to unseat the incumbent Chairman of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), in the Upper East Region, Mr Mohammed Murtala Ibrahim in a surprisingly contested Regional Executive election.
The incumbent polled 51 out of the 303 votes cast by the delegates. Other contestants in the Chairmanship race were: Mr Filson Awankua who polled 88 votes, Alhaj Abdullah Otito Achuliwor, 30 votes and Mr Joseph Agongo had five votes.
The election which was conducted peacefully saw 52 aspirants vie for ten executive positions including Regional Chairman, First and Second Vice Chairman, Regional Secretary, Regional Organiser, Youth organiser, Assistant Secretary, Women's Organiser, Nasara Coordinator and Treasurer.
Mr Namoo thanked the delegates for the confidence reposed in him to steer the affairs of the Party in the Region, and congratulated colleague aspirants for their efforts.
He pledged to work in unity with all members and urged them to rally their support for him to increase the fortunes of the Party and win more seats in the Region in the 2020 Parliamentary election.
Mr Namoo, however, expressed worry at the way some of the aspirants conducted themselves during the electioneering campaign, saying “some of the statements are so defamatory,” which were not beneficial to the Party.
The newly elected executives who were immediately sworn-in into office in the presence of Dr Mustapha Hamid, Minister for information, included Mr Moses Kwabena Atinga, First Vice Chairman, Mr Ibrahim Abubakar Bugri, Second Vice Chairman, Mr Cletus Innocent Ayabire, Secretary, Mr Elvis Figo Atia Awonekai, Assistant Secretary.
The rest are Mr Joseph Awinpanga Akanfaba, Treasurer, Mr Jerry Asamani, Organiser, Madam Georgina Ayamba, Women's Organiser, Mr Solomon Latif Yenah, Youth Organiser and Alhaji Mohammed Siitah Abubakari, Nasara Coordinator.
MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Jose Mourinho said he “doesn't know” if Manchester United can pull back Manchester City's 11-point lead at the top of the Premier League after his side's 2-1 derby defeat on Sunday.
United's manager also took aim at the referee Michael Oliver over what he felt was a clear penalty for his team and, after pre-match comments about City players falling over easily, he noted their ability to use up time at the end of the game.
United need to produce an exceptional second half of the season and hope that City stumble but Mourinho hardly sounded bullish about denying Guardiola his first league title in England.
“It is a significant distance,” Mourinho said of City's lead, before being asked if his team could make it up.
“I don't know. I know we can win next Wednesday (against Bournemouth). Win or lose or draw, I know that we can win next Wednesday,” he said.
“We can work and fight for it. That is the only thing I say. Match after match and every match we are going to give everything, with our qualities, with our problems, that is what we do all the time,” he said.
But, not for the first time in his career, Mourinho focused his attention on a refereeing decision rather than his team's performance.

The Portuguese coach believed Oliver should have awarded a penalty in the 79th minute when Ander Herrera went down in the box under pressure from City defender Nicolas Otamendi.
The referee instead booked Herrera for diving, leaving Mourinho fuming and claiming it was a repeat of last year when he felt United should have had a penalty in the derby.
“Exactly the same, you can speak about anything you want, you can bring any football theory, you can bring the stats, the ball possession, you can bring everything you want – but like last season it is a huge penalty in a crucial moment of the game,” he said.

“But I have also to say that I feel sorry for Michael Oliver because I think he had a good game, I would say very good game, assistants the same. I think they came with the intention to make the perfect work which they almost did,” he said.
Mourinho said he had not expected to lose to City without United's rivals scoring quality goals.
“I think when you see Manchester City play, you expect Manchester City to score great goals not to score two disgraceful goals,” he said. Both came from set pieces and were helped by defensive misfortune.
“They are the last goals you expect to concede against a quality team like Manchester City, two very bad goals.... with rebound(s). (They were) incredible lucky or unlucky, depending on (your) perspective,” he said, before noting City's keeper Ederson had to make a double save in the late stages to secure the win.
“Yes, they had much more of the ball. Yes, they had that apparent control of the game but the biggest save is the double save of their goalkeeper and the biggest decision of the game is the unlucky decision of Michael (Oliver).”
Akrum Wadley may not be a household name in the 2018 NFL Draft running back class, but he is a player that presents tremendous value on Day 3 for the Panthers.
Carolina tabbed Christian McCaffrey with its eighth overall selection in 2017, so don't look for the Panthers to go running back in Round 1. However, they will need to find a complement to McCaffrey, and there will be quite a bit of value in this year's draft on Days 2 and 3.
Everyone will be looking for the next Alvin Kamara or Kareem Hunt, and Wadley fits that “overlooked” seed that could blossom at the next level.
The initial and easy knock on Wadley is his size. He checked in at 5-foot-10 and 194 pounds at the combine in April, which might scare a few franchises off from taking the talented tailback.
The former Iowa Hawkeye had a very productive career in Iowa City.
His final two years were almost identical, posting 1,100 yards and 10 touchdowns on the ground, and another 325 yards and three touchdowns receiving.
He is so fast that he loses a shoe on this one play against Miami (OH).
Wadley is a very balanced back. He is equally lethal as a receiver as he is on the ground. McCaffrey possesses this powerful dual-threat option as well, which would give offensive coordinator Norv Turner two matchup nightmares in his backfield.
Wadley's vision and elusiveness will create problems for defenders. Much like the way McCaffrey can stop on a dime and break linebackers' ankles, Wadley takes great angles and is sudden in his movements.
Similarly to LeSean McCoy and Ronald Jones II, who lack ideal measurables, Wadley is a dual-purpose weapon that can shred a defense.
Carolina is probably looking for more of a Sonny Michel, Nick Chubb, Rashaad Penny feature back, but the Panthers have been heavily linked to Southern Miss scat back Ito Smith.
It's unclear what style of running back Turner wants beside McCaffrey, but a player like Wadley presents great value in a deep prospect pool and can be had in the fifth round.
If Carolina misses out on the premier running backs on Thursday and Friday nights, tapping the electric Wadley on Saturday would be a great selection.

Putin also needs to make a key strategic decision: whether to groom a preferred successor or try to stay at Russia's helm beyond 2024, either by scrapping term limits like China just did or by shifting into a new position of power.
When asked if he intends to initiate changes in the Russian constitution that could eliminate term limits, Putin answered that he has no such plans "yet."
Putin's electoral power has centred on stability, a quality cherished by Russians after the chaotic 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. But that stability has been bolstered by a suppression of dissent, the withering of independent media and the top-down control of politics in Russia's so-called "managed democracy."
That included heavy pressure on Russian voters to fulfil their "civic duty" and vote Sunday in order to maximize the turnout — even though most could accurately tell you who was going to win the presidential race beforehand.
Two election observers in Gorny Shchit, a rural district of Yekaterinburg, told The Associated Press they saw an unusually high influx of people going to the polls just before 2 p.m. A doctor in the Ural Mountains city told the AP that was the deadline for health officials to report to their superiors that they had voted.
Observer Sergei Krivonogov said voters were taking pictures of leaflets that poll workers distributed, seemingly to prove they had voted.
Other examples of Russian election irregularities cited by observers or posted on social media included ballot boxes being stuffed with extra ballots in multiple regions; an election official assaulting an observer; CCTV cameras obscured by flags or nets from watching ballot boxes; discrepancies in ballot numbers; last-minute voter registration changes likely designed to boost turnout; and a huge pro-Putin sign in one polling station.
Leaders of the observation mission for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said Monday that the Russian state media's extensive coverage of Putin's activities gave him a significant advantage in the race.
"While the incumbent president did not participate in debates or campaigning, extensive and unchallenging news coverage of his official activities continued to provide him with dominant presence in the media," said Marietta Tidei of the OSCE's Parliamentary Assembly.
"A choice without real competition — as we have seen in this election — is not a real choice," said Michael Georg Link, a co-ordinator of the observer mission.
Sergei Klimov, a 32-year-old resident of Yekaterinburg, said he was forced to go to vote but he ended up spoiling his ballot. He added, however, that he didn't see anyone who could challenge Putin.
"It's better to be with him than with anyone else," Klimov said of Putin. "Someone else wouldn't deliver what Putin will deliver."
Tsiya Soskina, a 78-year-old retiree in Yekaterinburg, said she did not go to vote because "they're going to decide everything for me anyway."
"I don't think we should expect anything good from Putin ... but at least there are no upheavals," she added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street put a floor under global equities on Friday after a weak inflation reading brought investors back into U.S. stocks even as tensions between the United States and North Korea continued to escalate, though the geopolitical fears still drove safe-haven buying of gold and the yen.Wall Street put a floor under global equities on Friday after a weak inflation reading brought investors back into U.S. stocks even as tensions between the United States and North Korea continued to escalate, though that tension still drove safe-haven buying of gold and the yen.
A small rise in a measure of U.S. consumer prices pointed to benign inflation that could make the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates again this year, which would be favourable to equity investors.
The hope that the Fed will have to slow its rate-hike path appeared to stop, at least for now, the near $1-trillion loss in world stocks valuations this week triggered by the war of words between Pyongyang and Washington.
"The slight bias to the upside (in stocks) is a result of the CPI number. The market is interpreting it as lowering the odds of the Fed raising rates in December," said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
Reuters data show a 22 percent perceived chance for a rate hike after the Fed's December meeting.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday, but the tense mood dragged Asian shares lower and an MSCI index of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS posted its largest weekly drop since the week before Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November.
Trump issued a new warning to Pyongyang on Friday, saying in a tweet: "Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely."
North Korea had responded to Trump's previous promise to unleash "fire and fury" with a threat to land missiles near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam.
The Dow and S&P 500 inched higher on the day but they both posted their largest weekly percentage drops since late March.
"There's not a great incentive to buy big," said Lerner of SunTrust Advisory. "You're less than 2 percent off the high for the S&P heading into a weekend where uncertainty with North Korea still lingers."
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.31 points, or 0.07 percent, to end at 21,858.32, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 3.11 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,441.32 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 39.68 points, or 0.64 percent, to 6,256.56.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.01 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.26 percent for a weekly loss of 1.6 percent, the largest since the week to Nov. 4.
Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF lost 1.27 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.47 percent lower.
South Korea's KOSPI .KS11 fell 1.7 percent on Friday to its lowest since May 24, but its losses for the week were a relatively modest 3.2 percent.
"Pretty remarkable, perhaps even extraordinary, considering," said Tim Ash, strategist at fund manager BlueBay.
A Reuters Datastream index of more than 7,000 stocks across the globe saw its market capitalization drop from a record high $61.36 trillion on Monday to $60.43 trillion at the close on Thursday.
Many world stock markets have hit record or multi-year highs in recent weeks, leaving them vulnerable to a selloff, and the tensions over North Korea proved to be the trigger.
The yen on Friday added to a strong weekly rally against the dollar of close to 1.5 percent, hitting its highest versus the greenback in almost four months, at 108.73 yen.
The yen tends to benefit during times of geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world's biggest creditor nation and there is an assumption that Japanese investors will repatriate funds should a crisis materialize.
The Korean won KRW=KFTC continued to fall versus the dollar, down 0.13 percent to 1,143.5 on Friday for a 1.6 percent decline on the week.
The dollar was further weighed down on Friday by the soft U.S. inflation data.
"If the data continues to come in on the softer side, the market might start to price the Fed staying on hold this year," said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho in New York.
The dollar index .DXY fell 0.32 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.42 percent to $1.1819.
Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3007, up 0.25 percent on the day.
The Japanese yen last strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 109.22 per dollar JPY=.
In bond markets, the yield on U.S. Treasuries fell, also pressured by the lowered expectations for a Fed move.
"There are four more (inflation) prints between now and the December FOMC meeting and we expect the Fed to remain data-dependent, if a touch more cautious," TD Securities said in a research note.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.1905 percent, from 2.211 percent late on Thursday.
The 30-year bond US30YT=RR was last up 4/32 in price to yield 2.7871 percent, from 2.794 percent late on Thursday.
After touching a more than two-month high at $1,291.86, spot gold XAU= last added 0.2 percent to $1,288.81 an ounce. Its weekly gain of 2.6 percent is the largest since June 2016.
Ongoing global glut concerns lingered in oil markets despite a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories, leaving prices volatile.
U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.41 percent to $48.79 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $52.01, up 0.21 percent.

* Spot gold seen rising to $1,357/oz -technicals * Palladium heading for worst week since week-ending Sept. 8, 2017 * U.S. nonfarm payrolls data due 1330 GMT (Adds comment, updates prices) By Sethuraman N R Feb 2 (Reuters) - Gold prices held in a narrow range on Friday ahead of U.S. jobs data later in the day, with traders looking for any implications for the outlook for U.S. monetary policy over the rest of the year. Spot gold was little changed at $1,348.66 per ounce by 0758 GMT. U.S. gold futures were up 0.3 percent at $1,351.60 per ounce. Traders are looking to the U.S. government's jobs report on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls probably rose by 180,000 jobs in January after increasing 148,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Stronger-than-expected jobs data, lower unemployment and higher wages would signal strength in the economy, and could in turn strengthen the dollar and pressure gold, analysts say. "All eyes on the non farm payrolls numbers tonight, a figure outside the consensus forecast could rattle the markets where volatility has already crept in over the last week or so," MKS PAMP Group trader Tim Brown said. The U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates unchanged on Wednesday but raised its inflation outlook and flagged "further gradual" rate increases. "The rate hikes seem to be doing little to dampen the relative resilience on display in gold," said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. Spot gold is expected to rise to $1,357 per ounce, as it has broken above resistance at $1,347, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. The dollar nursed losses against a basket of currencies on Friday and was on track for a weekly fall as investors focused on renewed economic strength in the eurozone. "Funds have been buying gold, while short interest remains low ... The gold chart continues to look bullish with prices well placed to break out of a multi-year base," ScotiaMocatta analysts said in a note. Silver fell 0.1 percent to $17.22 an ounce. Platinum dropped 0.1 percent to $1,005, while palladium rose 0.4 percent at $1,040.99. Palladium fell to its lowest since Dec. 18 at $1,013.72 on Thursday and is on track to its worst weekly fall since the week-ending Sept. 8, 2017. Prices are down 4.6 percent this week. It touched a record high at $1,138 on Jan. 15. (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Joseph Radford and Amrutha Gayathri)
This summer, Floating Points, the electronic music outfit of producer Sam Shepherd, released the ambitious Reflections — Mojave Desert project, which encompassed both a short film and a soundtrack recorded in the titular landscape. Now, Shepherd is following up that atmospheric soundscape with something decidedly more dance-friendly.
“Ratio” spans 18+ minutes and was developed as part of his solo electronic show, which he perfected at festivals like Coachella and Mad Cool. Take a listen to a three-minute radio edit, which Shepherd debuted on Annie Mac's BBC1 radio show today:.
Floating Points will be releasing “Ratio” both digitally and as a 12-inch vinyl, which will present a “deconstructed mix” of the track. The A-side will feature the first nine minutes as it unfolds in the digital version, while the second half will contain only the organ section. The B-side will feature the beat/drums and bassline of the second half of the track in isolation.
“Releasing the track in such a fashion, Shepherd encourages DJs to create their own mixes by bringing the different elements together in their own style,” reads a press release. How courteous of him.
“Ratio” will be released on October 19th.
The newborn baby that was abducted from a Florida hospital and located in Walterboro on Friday has reunited with her biological family.
On Friday, police arrested the suspect Gloria Williams on kidnapping charges.
DNA evidence confirmed that officials had found Kamiyah Mobley who was abducted when she was hours old 18 years ago.
It was a tip sent to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that got the ball rolling on this case last year.
Mobley's biological family came up from Jacksonville, Florida, to meet with her today.
The father had a message for other parents with missing children: keep fighting, keep praying, it's going to happen one day.
Kamiyah Mobley was reconnected with her biological family in a private reunion at the Walterboro Police Department. It lasted about 45 minutes. Her father, Craig Aiken, said he is still in shock.
Aiken told her he loved her and he missed her.
"First meeting was beautiful, it was wonderful, couldn't went any better... she was glad to meet us," Aiken said.
Mobley's mother was present as well. She did not comment.
"It's a feeling that you can't explain it, it's hard to put it in words right now it's hard to deal with this here right now," Aiken said. "We are just trying to process it, 18 years, it's going to be hard to make that up."
At this point the family says they are not sure what's next for them. The father says it will be Kamiyah's decision whether or not she will be visiting Florida.
"For anybody that lost hope just keep hope alive, just keep praying, keep fighting, if it happened to me, it can happen to anybody," Aiken said.

TOKYO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded at an annualised rate of 4.0 percent in April-June, posting a sixth straight quarter of expansion led by private consumption and capital expenditure, government data showed on Monday.
That marked the fastest pace of growth since January-March 2015.
The preliminary reading for second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) compared with a median estimate for a 2.5 percent annualised increase in a Reuters poll of economists.
It followed a revised 1.5 percent annualised rate of expansion in the prior quarter, Cabinet Office data showed.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 1.0 percent, against a 0.6 percent rise expected by economists.

PanARMENIAN.Net - The Armenian Armed Forces carry out constant combat duty along the entire border, Defense Ministry spokesman Artsrun Hovhannisyan said in response to reports that a new Azerbaijani position has been built near the village of Areni in Armenia's Vayots Dzor province.
“In the Nakhijevan area, works are proceeding in a normal way, and large-scale military and other works are also being conducted on the sites mentioned in social media. Residents of these villages are well aware of this, they are actively engaged in discussions,” Hovhannisyan said in a Facebook post.
“Our fighting capacity and capabilities are not determined by any single combat position or a single height.”
"Frequent posts in social networks hinder successful operations,” said the spokesman, calling for restraint.
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Facebook is stepping up its modest moves into e-commerce by expanding its service for connecting local buyers and sellers into 17 new European markets, the U.S. company said on Monday.
Marketplace, which sits alongside Facebook's mainstay newsfeed, photo, video, messaging and other services, marks fresh competition for community-based e-commerce pioneers such as Craigslist and eBay's classifieds business.
Marketplace is being introduced this week in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Launched 10 months ago, Marketplace charges no fees to buyers or sellers and aims to make it easy for users to trade mostly second-hand goods, with the ability to post items for sale via smartphone or computer in less than 15 seconds.
Marketplace, already up and running in a handful of markets including the United States, Britain and Australia, is building on Facebook's buy-sell groups. These draw in about 550 million monthly visitors, accounting for more than a quarter of Facebook's 2 billion global users.
"We want to make it easier to buy and sell, but we also want to make it community based," said Deborah Liu, vice president of Facebook Marketplace.
Prospective buyers can pick a radius for how far they wish to travel to collect purchases, but most transactions are local. Marketplace restricts searches within national boundaries, mainly to avoid language confusion, Liu said.
Facebook's e-commerce push has yet to make any significant financial impact. The company posted a 45 percent rise in revenue to $9.3 billion in the past quarter, nearly 98 percent of which came from advertising on its free services.
The low-key Marketplace service had 18 million items posted for sale in the United States in May, the company said, though it was unable to disclose how many items were sold because most transactions take place offline and are paid in cash.
While not an exact comparison, eBay, which operates in more than 30 countries, counted 171 million active users who completed at least one transaction in the past quarter.

Las Vegas (KLAS) — How much is a good night's sleep worth to you?
Smart Nora is pretty pricey, but it claims to silence snorers in seconds.
Nick Roberts is a snorer. He's so loud, his wife, Heidi, says she hasn't had a good night's sleep in 12 years.
“It's very loud,” Heidi Roberts said. “I have to try to get to sleep before him so it doesn't wake me up.”
They've tried other snoring solutions, from continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to nose strips. Nothing silenced that snore.
So the couple turned to Smart Nora, an egg-shaped device that sits on the nightstand.
If Nora hears snoring, she magically tells the inflator in the pillow to rise or fall, which in theory, would stop the snoring.
Both Nick and Heidi reported results right away.
“Day one, we just woke up and it's amazing. No snoring, I slept awesome,” said Heidi Roberts.
If snoring did occur, Nora nixed it quickly. Nick Roberts says he never notices the pillow going up or down.
“It never woke me up,” he said.
After two weeks, the couple couldn't stop singing Smart Nora's praises.
Even their kids slept better, since snoring no longer reverberated throughout the house.
“Buy it. It works. It is worth the money,” said Heidi Roberts.
Smart Nora costs $300 full price (it's currently on sale for $269). Click here for more information.

Regarding “Trump cuts target Great Lakes, Mich. programs,” I am deeply concerned about what the proposed Trump budget would mean for clean water here in Michigan.
The Great Lakes are vital to our ecology, our health and our way of life here in Michigan. Federal EPA funding has been critical in helping the Great Lakes address major challenges — including the Asian carp threat and algal blooms. Yet, the Trump administration's budget would drastically cut funding to address these problems, and would mean less environmental cops on the beat to go after polluters.
As the article mentions, this budget virtually eliminates funding for the Great Lakes restoration, which is vital in maintaining our clean water.
Sens. Peters and Stabenow should reject this budget. The Great Lakes come in dead last in this so-called “America First” budget. Let's get a budget that helps us secure clean water for all Michiganians.

Letter: Dismantle the FAA's involvement in medical certification?
By Jim Posner, Poulsbo, Wash. I have long thought that the FAA should NOT be in the medical certification business, at least for Part 91 operations. Ever since my denial – despite letters from my doctors specifically stating that I am good to go – I have tried to understand why they should consider themselves more qualified to determine my fitness to fly than my own experts.
JILA's 3-D Quantum Gas Atomic Clock Offers New Dimensions in Measurement
Washington, DC - JILA physicists have created an entirely new design for an atomic clock, in which strontium atoms are packed into a tiny three-dimensional (3-D) cube at 1,000 times the density of previous one-dimensional (1-D) clocks. In doing so, they are the first to harness the ultra-controlled behavior of a so-called “quantum gas” to make a practical measurement device.
With so many atoms completely immobilized in place, JILA's cubic quantum gas clock sets a record for a value called “quality factor” and the resulting measurement precision. A large quality factor translates into a high level of synchronization between the atoms and the lasers used to probe them, and makes the clock's “ticks” pure and stable for an unusually long time, thus achieving higher precision.
Until now, each of the thousands of “ticking” atoms in advanced clocks behave and are measured largely independently. In contrast, the new cubic quantum gas clock uses a globally interacting collection of atoms to constrain collisions and improve measurements. The new approach promises to usher in an era of dramatically improved measurements and technologies across many areas based on controlled quantum systems.
The new clock is described in the Oct. 6 issue of Science.
“We are entering a really exciting time when we can quantum engineer a state of matter for a particular measurement purpose,” said physicist Jun Ye of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Ye works at JILA, which is jointly operated by NIST and the University of Colorado Boulder.
The clock's centerpiece is an unusual state of matter called a degenerate Fermi gas (a quantum gas for Fermi particles), first created in 1999 by Ye's late colleague Deborah Jin. All prior atomic clocks have used thermal gases. The use of a quantum gas enables all of the atoms' properties to be quantized, or restricted to specific values, for the first time.
“The most important potential of the 3-D quantum gas clock is the ability to scale up the atom numbers, which will lead to a huge gain in stability,” Ye said. “Also, we could reach the ideal condition of running the clock with its full coherence time, which refers to how long a series of ticks can remain stable. The ability to scale up both the atom number and coherence time will make this new-generation clock qualitatively different from the previous generation.”
Until now, atomic clocks have treated each atom as a separate quantum particle, and interactions among the atoms posed measurement problems. But an engineered and controlled collection, a “quantum many-body system,” arranges all its atoms in a particular pattern, or correlation, to create the lowest overall energy state. The atoms then avoid each other, regardless of how many atoms are added to the clock. The gas of atoms effectively turns itself into an insulator, which blocks interactions between constituents.
The result is an atomic clock that can outperform all predecessors. For example, stability can be thought of as how precisely the duration of each tick matches every other tick, which is directly linked to the clock's measurement precision. Compared with Ye's previous 1-D clocks, the new 3-D quantum gas clock can reach the same level of precision more than 20 times faster due to the large number of atoms and longer coherence times.
The experimental data show the 3-D quantum gas clock achieved a precision of just 3.5 parts error in 10 quintillion (1 followed by 19 zeros) in about 2 hours, making it the first atomic clock to ever reach that threshold (19 zeros). “This represents a significant improvement over any previous demonstrations,” Ye said.
The older, 1-D version of the JILA clock was, until now, the world's most precise clock. This clock holds strontium atoms in a linear array of pancake-shaped traps formed by laser beams, called an optical lattice. The new 3-D quantum gas clock uses additional lasers to trap atoms along three axes so that the atoms are held in a cubic arrangement. This clock can maintain stable ticks for nearly 10 seconds with 10,000 strontium atoms trapped at a density above 10 trillion atoms per cubic centimeter. In the future, the clock may be able to probe millions of atoms for more than 100 seconds at a time.
Optical lattice clocks, despite their high levels of performance in 1-D, have to deal with a tradeoff. Clock stability could be improved further by increasing the number of atoms, but a higher density of atoms also encourages collisions, shifting the frequencies at which the atoms tick and reducing clock accuracy. Coherence times are also limited by collisions. This is where the benefits of the many-body correlation can help.
The 3-D lattice design—imagine a large egg carton—eliminates that tradeoff by holding the atoms in place. The atoms are fermions, a class of particles that cannot be in the same quantum state and location at once. For a Fermi quantum gas under this clock's operating conditions, quantum mechanics favors a configuration where each individual lattice site is occupied by only one atom, which prevents the frequency shifts induced by atomic interactions in the 1-D version of the clock.
JILA researchers used an ultra-stable laser to achieve a record level of synchronization between the atoms and lasers, reaching a record-high quality factor of 5.2 quadrillion (5.2 followed by 15 zeros). Quality factor refers to how long an oscillation or waveform can persist without dissipating. The researchers found that atom collisions were reduced such that their contribution to frequency shifts in the clock was much less than in previous experiments.
“This new strontium clock using a quantum gas is an early and astounding success in the practical application of the ‘new quantum revolution,' sometimes called ‘quantum 2.0',” said Thomas O'Brian, chief of the NIST Quantum Physics Division and Ye's supervisor. “This approach holds enormous promise for NIST and JILA to harness quantum correlations for a broad range of measurements and new technologies, far beyond timing.”
Depending on measurement goals and applications, JILA researchers can optimize the clock's parameters such as operational temperature (10 to 50 nanokelvins), atom number (10,000 to 100,000), and physical size of the cube (20 to 60 micrometers, or millionths of a meter).
Atomic clocks have long been advancing the frontier of measurement science, not only in timekeeping and navigation but also in definitions of other measurement units and other areas of research such as in tabletop searches for the missing “dark matter” in the universe.
The National Bureau of Standards, now NIST, invented the first atomic clock in 1948

Damien Woody applauds Leonard Fournette for his honesty but encourages the running back to prepare for tougher opponents as the preseason continues. (1:03)
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Rookie running back Leonard Fournette caused a stir last week when he said the transition from college to the NFL was "really easy" because he played in the Southeastern Conference.
As outlandish as that sounds, several of his Jacksonville Jaguars teammates say he's right.
"I feel like he was kind of right," said third-year running back T.J. Yeldon, who played three seasons at Alabama. "Playing in the SEC, the game speeds up. It's faster. It's kind of like the NFL. The NFL is a tad bit faster.
"I get where he's coming from with that comment."
T.J. Yeldon agrees with new teammate Leonard Fournette, that the NFL doesn't seem so fast after playing in the SEC. Logan Bowles/USA TODAY Sports
Rookie offensive tackle Cam Robinson also played at Alabama, and while the offensive line is a different world than running back, he said his games against LSU, Auburn, Florida and the rest of the SEC have made a huge difference for him.
"I feel like what he was trying to say was the speed of the game we played in college, just the talent game in and game out that you're going against, is so elite that the game is played at a fast pace," Robinson said. "So I think he was just meaning that when it came to the actual pace of the game that what we faced at college did a god job preparing us for what we see at this level right now."
Unlike Yeldon and Robinson, running back Corey Grant wasn't drafted and didn't step into a starting role as a rookie. He signed with the Jaguars in 2015 as an undrafted free agent and got on the field as a kick returner and carried the ball just six times for 2 yards.
Even so, he said playing at both Alabama and Auburn -- he left Tuscaloosa, Alabama, after one season -- helped ease the transition.
"I kind of feel the same way [as Fournette]," Grant said. "Coming from the SEC, it's really a hard-nosed league. Pac-10, all those others conferences and stuff, they're good and they're physical and everything, but it's just something about coming out of the SEC. You see a lot of guys who come out of the SEC [and] when they get into the league they kind of have success. I'm not going to say more success, but the majority are successful.
"And you know just playing against that caliber of talent in the SEC and then coming into the NFL it, kind of just translated right over."
Fournette made his comment after the Jaguars' 31-24 victory over New England in the preseason opener in which he rushed for 31 yards and a touchdown on nine carries. He converted a fourth-and-1 with an 8-yard run and scored on a 1-yard touchdown run against a Patriots team that held 40 of their 90 players out of the game, including the entire starting lineup on both sides of the ball.
"It's a lot slower than I really thought," Fournette told NFL Media. "That's how I've been since I first got into the NFL. A lot of people were like, 'It's going to be fast.' But by me playing the SEC, that kind of helped me a lot. I think to me it was really easy."
To be fair, Fournette made a similar comment after an early training-camp practice, saying the game slowed down for him once the team put on full pads: "It's easier now."
Grant said that's what Fournette probably should have said last week: The transition hasn't been as tough as he was warned it would be. Using the word "easy" was what caused the uproar -- although it may actually be the case for Fournette, who rushed for 3,830 yards and 40 touchdowns in three seasons at LSU.
"I mean, it could be easy for him," Grant said. "He's a different breed. He's a very high-caliber player and since he's been here and being in meetings with him, he's surprised me as a rookie. This is just my third year but you have guys come and out all the time and he's one guy that really stood out to me. He knew protections, different cuts, runs, identifying defenses.
"That's a credit to him and credit to LSU developing players to be ready for the league once they get here."
Kim Jong-nam (left) and Kim Jong-un (Yonhap)
South Korea's spy agency Wednesday confirmed the killing of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's half-brother, saying Kim Jong-nam had faced murder attempts for the past five years that prompted him to “beg for mercy.”Kim, 46, asked for help while queuing to board a flight to Macau at the international airport in Kuala Lumpur at around 9 a.m. on Monday, after two women approached to poison him, National Intelligence Service Director Lee Byung-ho told lawmakers, citing CCTV footage. He was pronounced dead on his way to a nearby hospital and the suspects were likely to be North Korean operatives and still in Malaysia.Kim was believed to have a fake passport as he often did in the past. Malaysian police confirmed the death of a North Korean man identified with his travel document as Kim Chol, born in Pyongyang in 1970.The assassination of Kim Jong-nam had been a ‘standing order' since Kim Jong-un took power,” Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the Democratic Party of Korea told reporters after a closed-door session with the spy chief, adding that a full-fledged attempt was made in early 2012.“In April 2012, Kim Jong-nam sent a letter to Kim Jong-un, begging for mercy for him and his family and saying they have no place to go and hide out, and they know well that the only way to run away is to commit suicide.”The NIS assessed that multiple agencies may have been involved but the Reconnaissance General Bureau could be the chief engineer. His first wife and son live in Beijing, and his second wife, son and daughter in Macau, under the protection of the Chinese authorities.But the agency denied speculation that the deceased Kim could have sought to defect to South Korea, the lawmaker said, adding he had never made such an attempt.“(The killing) reflects Kim Jong-un's monomaniacal personality rather than the calculation that (Kim Jong-nam) posed a threat to his rule,” said Rep. Lee Cheol-woo of the Liberty Party who chairs the parliamentary intelligence panel.In Malaysia, Kim's body is set for autopsy later in the day, while the authorities continue to track down the two women who the NIS said took off in the same taxi.Japanese news reports suggested they could already be dead, but Seoul officials said they could not confirm it.Seoul is striving to analyze the incident's implications such as if it is a sign of instability within the reclusive regime. It also scaled up security for key North Korean defectors, some of whom have faced death threats from North Korean agents in the past.Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn convened a meeting of the National Security Council early Wednesday, calling for watertight readiness and vigilance across the border.By Shin Hyon-hee ( heeshin@heraldcorp.com
Source: Mangudya calls for consumer resistance | Daily News
HARARE – Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mangudya (JM) is really not amused by his countrymen's inclination towards inflicting harm on themselves; he is adamant that there is no need for the panic buying that rattled markets in recent weeks and advises consumers not to buy from shops that are bent on fleecing them of their hard-earned income.
The Daily News' Farai Machamire (FM) spoke to Mangudya on these and other issues. Excerpts:
FM: What is your view of the current state of Zimbabwe's economy?
JM: The truth of the matter is that economic indicators are improving. The economy is growing on account of agriculture and mining sectors that are doing well. Tourism is also performing well; there is an improvement in tourist arrivals. It's evidence-based.
Sometimes I feel I am not in the same country as others because when I go through magazines and newspapers, I read that certain companies are retrenching or that some are closing. (But) to the contrary, we have seen a net increase in employment in Zimbabwe.
I can give you a number of firms, as examples. The clothing employed 1 000 people about a year ago; now it employs 6 000. The depressing reports could be that Zimbabweans want to spend time on the negative side. I know in life there are always two sides hence it's natural sometimes to get these things.
But as far as we are concerned, the economy is expanding and what we are going through are the side effects of a growing economy. What are the downside risks of this growth?
The economy is growing at a much faster rate than we are generating foreign exchange required to sustain that growth. Why?
Because we are a net importer, Zimbabwe's import dependency in general is about 40 percent. For our industry, the average is 50 percent. Other companies are at 70 percent. Foreign exchange is therefore a critical function of production in Zimbabwe.
FM: So, if things are improving, why is the market pregnant with scepticism?
JM: Zimbabweans are so divided as individuals. We are so polarised as a society. We have no unity of purpose. So, you find that what is in the papers mirrors what we are at the end of the day also? So, I never blame the newspapers when they write their stories: What they are simply doing is to mirror our society, depending on who they ask.
Some people are now trying to take advantage of what happened in the past years, by trying to create the 2008 crisis this time for personal interests and not necessarily because of fundamentals.
FM: Prices have continued to increase; what is the antidote to this?
JM: There is need for consumer resistance. There is a lot of rent-seeking behaviour in our society. Some unscrupulous businesspeople keep increasing prices because there is demand for their products, never mind the extortionate prices.
What should actually be happening is that businesses should be reducing their prices as we don't expect them to remain high given that they are getting foreign currency from the banking system.
If we did not have the foreign currency to support their requirements, it could have been a veld fire. That's why I say the answer is that we need foreign exchange to dampen all these premiums on the parallel market. If prices are high, consumers should shun those retailers. Don't buy cooking oil at $5.
At times some of our people are difficult to understand. They want to fix Mangudya and government by engaging in some of these reckless behaviours. Well, go and buy at those prices if you have the money . . . you are basically fixing yourself.
But at the end of the day, some will come back and say they want a salary increase when they are shooting themselves in the foot. Forget it, there is not going to be any salary increase whatsoever. Just don't buy. That's consumer resistance. We need to show we are unhappy. People should not take advantage of the unsuspecting public.
FM: We have seen wads of new bond notes being traded on the streets by illegal traders. Who is funnelling this money onto the parallel market?
JM: The RBZ does not participate in that. All the money from the RBZ goes through the normal banking system. What we know is that there are cartels wherein the retailers when they collect cash they take it onto the streets.
Instead of banking the cash, they make an RTGS to the RBZ and give the physical cash to these guys (black market dealers). We have also been investigating all those social media pictures (of people with wads of bond notes) and we are making good inroads.
My guys go office by office, but we are spending more time on unproductive work. This is not my job, but as the governor, I can't sleep when people are playing with our resources. I should be spending time looking for foreign currency and not going from volt by volt. It's not right.
FM: What are you doing to clamp-down on the existing three-tier pricing system?
JM: Those premiums are an indicator that something is wrong. The three-tier system is a reflection of the foreign currency shortages. Zimbabwe is earning substantial foreign currency and if we were using it efficiently, there wasn't going to be any such problem.
(In fact), during the month of January to end of September, this economy earned $4 billion in foreign currency from exports, Diaspora remittances and other inflows, which is not small money. But, how it is being utilised (is the issue).
Some of it is being taken out of the economy by importing things that are useless. Some are keeping it in their houses due to lack of confidence. We need to have a national approach to business.
So, we don't clamp down on the three-tier pricing system, what we are doing is to look at way of increasing foreign currency earnings to eradicate it. As long as there is a gap between demand and supply, this will continue happening. Even if we arrest every Zimbabwean, that will not bring foreign exchange into the economy.
FM: How has been the uptake of the bureaux de change licences?
JM: To date, we have licensed 13 bureaux de change agents. We can have as many bureaux de changes as possible. Go and sell your money in a licensed bureau de change.
FM: Since you started clamping down on illegal traders, how much have you managed to recover?
JM: All I can say is that so far 20 people who were doing that have been nabbed. The funds have been taken from them and by last night there were still counting the money. If they were still counting by yesterday, I think it must have been a large amount although I don't have the exact figure right now.
FM: The bond notes have been seen as a complete failure by many; from your perspective, is the export incentive scheme working?
JM: If you ask me today whether the export incentive scheme is working, I will say yes it is working. Unfortunately, because of different narratives, either deliberately or ignorantly or both, you see someone spending more time on debating about bond notes than working. The export incentive is assisting companies to go and export and bring in foreign currency.
FM: Where do you see the rate of inflation in Zimbabwe going in the coming months?
JM: We are in a positive low inflation level. We need to maintain low level inflation. Businesses should, however, be responsible in their pricing. I am in retail myself and I look at prices in my shop, which are lower than those of my competitors and yet we are buying from the same producers. I ask myself; what is wrong with us?
Like what Michael Jackson said in his song The Man in the Mirror, let's look at ourselves critically. Let's sow the seed of love in one another. That's what is missing in this country. As Jesus said, I leave you with one great commandment, love one another. And if we love one another, you cannot increase cooking oil price to $5 when you have bought it at $3,10.
FM: Are we going to see the adoption of the South African rand?
JM: I have been saying this over and over again. I don't know why you believe in social media over what I am telling you. I said the rand is part of our multi-currency system. No one is refusing to use the rand in this country.
Number two, the rand is foreign currency you need to export to get. Number three, you cannot export gold or tobacco with US dollars and then sell our US dollars at the Reserve Bank of South Africa to get rands; does that make sense? . . . What I am saying is that this was a question for 2009 when we dollarised the economy. That is when the issue should have been discussed.
Secondly, if we don't have a facility from South Africa, a loan facility, how do we get the rand? So it means you need someone to give you the loan facility. And during the GNU, my understanding was that there was going to be a $1 billion facility from South Africa, that's what I thought; that's what I heard but we did not get that facility.
But if today there is a facility, it means the money will be in the market. And also, if we are now use the rand, it means we need to change US dollar accounts and if I am to change, people will get a currency with a lower value.
Imagine you are an exporter and tomorrow I change your money and give you rand. Do you think that is normal? Ahh no guys. Even yourself, your personal accounts from US into rand? Hamundirove? (Wouldn't you beat me?)
The answer in simple terms is that the multi-currency system is remaining in Zimbabwe. That's government's position and that's not changing. If that was true don't you think I would have sent out a statement? Haa this fake news ka ichakunetsai (this fake news will create problems for you).
FM: Despite your assurances, many still panic and have their own perceptions of the economy. Is there any need to panic?
JM: There is no need to panic. I am happy the economy has been responding positively to our policy interventions. We have availed facilities to ensure that foreign currency for basic commodities that include electricity, cooking oil, medicinal pharmaceuticals, fuel, is available. There is no need to panic in this country. Manufacturers should continue to produce.
Yes, resources are limited. There is no country in the world with unlimited resources. That's why we need to allocate them to the best of our ability. After everything is said and done, we need to remain as one. I always go to my favourite scripture Nehemiah; let's build Zimbabwe as a team.
