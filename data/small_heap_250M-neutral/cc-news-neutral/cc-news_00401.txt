A$AP Ferg just dropped a new track named after the actor Nia Long, who got their start playing Claudia Prescott in The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. This is the latest in a series of one-off singles Ferg has been releasing as of late; back in April we heard their Remy Ma collab “East Coast” as well as “Wrong,” which they debuted alongside A$AP Rocky. Listen to “Nia Long,” which was produced by HighDefRazjah, below.
Mount Maunganui: India on Saturday lifted a record fourth U-19 World Cup trophy after an eight-wicket rout of Australia in the final, underlining their dominant run in the tournament and giving Rahul Dravid the biggest success of their coaching career.
As it has been the case throughout the tournament, India had all their bases covered with bowlers' bouncing backing to dismiss Australia for 216 from 183 for four at one stage. The highly-rated batting, barring a minor blip, completed the job with conviction as India chased down the modest target in 38.5 overs.
Delhi-boy Manjot Kalra emerged as the man for the big occasion, scoring a sublime 101 not out off 102 balls and anchoring the innings after the loss of skipper Prithvi Shaw and team's leading scorer in the tournament, Shubman Gil.
With a fourth crown, India surpassed Australia in the race of most U-19 World Cup titles. Prior to the final, India and Australia were locked at three titles each.
The team's performance was also a fitting tribute to coach Dravid, who finally got their hands on a World Cup trophy. Under Dravid, the side had finished runner-up in the 2016 edition in Bangladesh. India's previous title came in Australia six years ago when the Unmukt Chand-led team beat the hosts in the final.
The Virat Kohli-led side was victorious in 2008 and Mohammed Kaif was captain when India triumphed way back in 2000. In the current edition, India were the overwhelming favourites and they played like one, dishing out dominant performances one after the other.
The gulf between them and other teams was clearly evident. In the playing eleven of the final, India fielded five players with First-Class experience while Australia had just one in captain Jason Sangha.
Having lost skipper Shaw (29) and Gill (31), Kalra displayed commendable calm and composure to see the team through. Harvik Desai (47 not out) provided the support Kalra needed after India were 131 for two in the 22nd over, needing another 86 for victory.
Kalra, who had smashed a match-winning 86 against Australia in the tournament opener, was in devastating touch again. They hammered the spinners for huge sixes and showed their silken touch by beautifully driving the pacers through covers. In the end, they finished with eight fours and three sixes.
It was only fitting that they reached the three figures in the last over of the final. Desai hit the winning boundary, sending the team members and the packed crowd into a frenzy.
Earlier, Jonathan Merlo made a solid 76 before India's left-arm spin duo of Shiva Singh and Anukul Roy sprung into action, limiting Australia to 216.
At 183 for four, Australia looked well on course to reach 250 in a high-pressure match until the Indian spinners engineered the collapse with the Sangha-led side losing its last six wickets for 33 runs.
Australia, who had little hesitation in batting first, were guilty of not converting starts into big partnerships. Merlo and Param Uppal (34) were involved in a 75-run stand for the fourth wicket before the innings' top-scorer shared 49-runs with Nathan McSweeney (23) to set the platform for a competitive total.
However, the momentum shifted hugely into India's favour when Shiva (2/36) set up Sweeney to have the batsman caught and bowled, leaving Australia at 183 for five.
Earlier, India's leading wicket-taker in the event, Anukul Roy (2/32), had sent back Uppal in a similar fashion as offered a simple catch back to the bowler while attempting to play against the spin.
While Indian spinners delivered under pressure in the middle overs, the pacers were impressive again upfront and towards the end. Hitting through the line was not easy as the surface was on the slower side. The best example of that was the dismissal of openers Jack Edwards (28) and Max Bryant (14).
Pacer Ishan Porel (2/30) got rid of both the openers who punched a rising ball straight to cover. Kamlesh Nagarkoti (2/41), another find for India in the tournament, removed Australian captain Jason Sangha (13) that moved away just enough to take the edge to the wicket-keeper.
Nagarkoti along with Shivam Mavi (1/46) also helped in polishing off the tail after Shiva's accurate throw from deep had Baxter Bolt run out on 13. Both teams went into the contest unchanged.
Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for London, and pretty much the rest of southern Ontario.
The national weather agency is calling it the first widespread snowfall of the winter season.
Locally, a weather statement is in effect for London, Parkhill, Strathroy and Komoka as well eastern and western Middlesex County.
It also extends to neighbouring Lambton, Huron, Oxford and Perth Counties.

Meteorologist David Rogers says an Alberta clipper is expected to come through the area, which could bring about 10 centimetres of snow by Tuesday morning.
“For Monday, we can expect the snow to be in late morning, early afternoon, with a couple centimetres of snow in the afternoon, then more snow tonight,” said Rogers.
“The afternoon commute could be a little slower and a little messier because of the snow, and Tuesday morning could be interesting as well depending on how the road crews do.”

Although some areas could receive 10 to 15 centimetres, Environment Canada isn't expecting the 15 centimetres in 12 hours that's required for a warning.
They say flurries are in the forecast for London most of this week, with snowsqualls possible in areas near Lake Huron Tuesday.
“The possibility of snowsqualls continues into Wednesday and then we're looking at scattered flurries for the remainder of the week with temperatures well below normal.”

Rogers says to brace for colder than normal temperatures this week, expecting highs around -5 C.
They say it's a little early to say for certain, but there's a decent chance the snow will stick around until Christmas.

Every quarter I take a look at the top FTSE 100 companies in each of the index's 10 industries to see how they shape up as a potential starter portfolio.
The table below shows the 10 heavyweights and their valuations based on forecast 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and dividend yields.
Company Industry Recent share price (p) P/E Yield (%) BAE Systems Industrials 612 13.9 3.7 British American Tobacco (LSE: BATS) Consumer Goods 4,774 15.5 4.1 GlaxoSmithKline (LSE: GSK) Health Care 1,530 13.6 5.2 HSBC Holdings Financials 756 13.9 5.3 National Grid Utilities 935 15.0 5.0 Rio Tinto Basic Materials 3,685 12.4 4.8 Royal Dutch Shell Oil & Gas 2,336 16.3 6.2 Sage Technology 727 22.1 2.4 Tesco Consumer Services 188 16.1 2.5 Vodafone Telecommunications 212 25.9 6.2
Before looking at which individual companies might be particularly good buys today, let's get a feel for the overall value. The table below shows average P/Es and yields for the group as a whole for the last four quarters and six years.
P/E Yield (%) October 2017 16.5 4.5 July 2017 16.4 4.6 April 2017 16.8 4.6 January 2017 17.0 4.4 October 2016 17.3 4.0 October 2015 13.7 5.6 October 2014 13.1 4.6 October 2013 12.1 4.7 October 2012 11.1 4.7 October 2011 9.8 5.0
My rule of thumb is that an average P/E below 10 is bargain territory, 10-14 is good value and above 14 starts to move towards expensive.
As you can see, the P/E has edged up this quarter after three successive falls and remains towards the expensive end of my valuation spectrum. This doesn't mean that the group of companies can't deliver a good return for investors, just that it could take longer to achieve than if the stocks were bought at a lower valuation.
Sin stock on offer
British American Tobacco (BAT) is one stock I'd highlight as looking particularly buyable today. The current P/E of 15.5 is a little above my 10-14 good value segment but so-called ‘defensive' sectors, such as tobacco, routinely trade on higher P/Es.
BAT's P/E was 17.6 last quarter and I have to go back to my October 2014 review to find the last time it was available on a P/E as low as the current 15.5. The current dividend yield of 4.1% also compares favourably with last quarter's 3.7%.
At 4,774p, BAT's shares are down 8.8% from 5,234p last quarter, despite a modest upgrade to its forward 12-month earnings and dividend forecasts. This combination of factors has led to today's significantly lower P/E and more generous yield.
Health choice also cheap
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is another defensive stock I'd highlight as looking very buyable today. I have to go back to my January 2014 review to find the last time this stock was available on a P/E as low as its current 13.6. And it was three quarters ago that it was last offering a yield as high as today's 5.2%.
At 1,530p, GSK's shares are down 6.5% from 1,636p last quarter when its P/E was 14.5 and yield 4.9%. The forward 12-month earnings and dividend forecasts are little changed, so it's the lower share price alone that accounts for the more attractive valuation today.
Elsewhere, shares of National Grid, which I spotlighted for you last quarter, have since edged down 1.8%. This has been enough to take the yield up to nudge 5% for the first time since my July 2015 review.
So, pot czar Justin Trudeau, realizing their actual street dealers were on the verge of a revolt, turned to their Mr. Big, Bill Morneau, and told them to divvy up a more saleable split of the profits from upcoming pot deals.
When profits are projected to be in the billions, honour among thieves, and we say “thieves” with all due respect, begins to lose its lustre.
After all, it will be the street dealers who will be taking on the majority of the risk, meaning all those premiers hypnotized by dollar signs who will have to set up their own turf, build their own drug outlets, collect the juice from the sales, and deal with law enforcement should the criminal element invade their space.
A 50-50 split just wouldn't cut it.
That was the original Trudeau-Morneau plan.
Right down the middle. Bada bing, bada boom.
On Monday, however, the country's provincial finance ministers met in Ottawa, much like mafia chieftains gathered back in 1957 at the home of Joseph (Joe the Barber) Barbara in the sleepy hamlet of Apalachin, N.Y., to discuss how to split up the illegal operations of the recently-departed Albert Anastasia (via a barbershop hit) and proclaim Vito Genovese as the capo dei capi.
While the Ottawa gathering was not raided by the coppers, the talk was all about drugs, and the Liberal government's plan to legalize the recreational use of marijuana by Canada Day of next year which, up until then, is technically as illegal as the possession of unprescribed opioids.
Judging by various media reports, the leader of the revolt by street-level dealers was Manitoba Finance Minister Cameron Friesen, who demanded a big share of the dividend because it was provincial governments such as theirs that would be taking all the risks and doing the majority of the heavy lifting.
Drug dealing is no easy task.
Up until July 1, 2018, people will still be going to jail for doing what the Trudeau Liberals plan to make legal — for legitimate government sales, that is, not the trafficking and sale of pot by gangbangers, bikers and other low lifes.
So, how does 70-30 sound?
Forget 60-40. Let's not nickel and dime each other. Instead, let's cut to the chase, shake hands, and call it a done deal.
Seventy per cent for the provinces; 30% for the feds.
Do we have a deal?
On second thought, let's make it 75% for the province, and 25% for the feds. And, on top of that, says Morneau, the feds will also toss the provinces any excess profit over $100 million for the first two years.
Just sign here.
The way Friesen saw it, provinces deserved a bigger slice for the dividend because they shoulder most of the burden, as in the “risks and responsibilities in areas like roadside policing and justice, health and mental health regulations.”
Ontario, of course, is desperate for new revenues, and is salivating at the thought of the millions that will be reaped from the legalization of marijuana, and hoping it will pay for new promises to get them re-elected in the weeks before bongs are legally fashionable.
Missing from Morneau's announcement, however, was any commitment to the municipalities that will be epicentres for legal marijuana sales.
This means every major city in the country will have to go begging to their provinces for their piece of the pot pie, even though they own all the street corners and have to pay for the majority of the policing.
So, another turf war looms — with only six months to go before the advent of legal dope smoking.
Look up the word snafu.

Switzerland says it has returned all the money kept in the country by late Nigeria Head of State Gen. Sani Abacha, with 1.5 million dollars interest. Ambassador Pio Wennubst, Assistant Director-General and Head, Global Cooperation Department, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, told reporters in New York on Monday. Wennubst said Switzerland returned about 322.5 million dollars (N116.11 billion) to the Nigerian government.
They also said that the original amount was 321 million dollars. The government had announced receipt of 322.51 million from the Swiss government as part of the looted funds recovered from the late former Head of State. Confirming this, Wennubst said: “We returned 321 million dollars including the interests.
“We return all the amount, 322.5 million dollars including the interest for the time that the funds were blocked.'' The Swiss envoy also said that the money was returned to Nigeria unconditionally. “After discussing, the only condition, set by the judiciary, not by us, was that the return of this asset should have been monitored by the World Bank and this is where we worked on.''
According to him, these funds were part of the Nigerian government contributions to the social safety net programme, “plus concessional loans from the Bank”. The ‘Abacha loot' was frozen in 2014 by a Swiss court after a legal procedure against their son, Abba Abacha.

NEW DELHI: Housing, auto and corporate loans are all set to become cheaper with half a dozen public sector undertaking (PSU) and private banks Monday steeply reducing benchmark lending rate by up to 1.48 per cent after spurt in deposits following demonetisation.
Taking a cue from State Bank of India, other lenders including the largest private sector lender ICICI Bank and state-owned Oriental Bank of Commerce and Andhra Bank announced cut in marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR).
The SBI on Sunday reduced the lending rate by a good 0.9 per cent after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their new year eve address urged the banks to focus on the needs of poor and lower middle class and middle class.
The reduction in lending rates may prompt an increase in credit offtake which has moderated substantially putting burden on balance sheet of banks.
Home loan rate for ICICI Bank will come down between 0.45 and 0.6 per cent depending on quantum and category. Another private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank too reduced the MCLR rate by up to 0.45 per cent. The bank has reduced MCLR by 0.20 per cent to 9 per cent from 9.20 per cent for 1-year tenor, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a statement.

Oriental Bank of Commerce has reduced the one-year MCLR rate by 0.8 per cent to 8.60 per cent while Andhra Bank has brought it down by similar percentage point to 8.65 per cent effective Tuesday.
Dena bank has reduced marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.75 per cent to 8.55 per cent for 1 year tenor, the bank said in a statement.
On Sunday, the country's largest lender SBI along with PNB and Union Bank of India, slashed lending rates by up to 0.9 per cent. Following the reduction, lending rate of SBI for a one-year loan has come down to 8 per cent from 8.90 per cent.

By Zhong Sheng from People's Daily
Last October, a three-episode documentary, “China: Time of Xi”, which introduces Chinese President Xi Jinping's ideas and visions on national governance, had its debut on the Discovery Channel.
The historic changes took place in China in recent years displayed in the documentary have made its US and UK producers feel deeply that the spiritual force pushing China forward, and that the primary source of power behind these changes is Xi's ideas on national governance.
Actions can generate more power under the guidance of thoughts. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held last October approved an amendment to the Party Constitution which enshrines Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, elevating the Thought into the Party's guidance to action.
On March 11, 2018, the Thought was written into the country's Constitution after the amendment was adopted at the first session of the 13th National People's Congress with an overwhelming majority. The inclusion of Xi's thought into the country's fundamental law ensures a high-level unity between the will of the Party as well as the aspirations of the people.
The two historic moments have made the world witness how the brilliant thought guides China to march toward more progress.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that “Karl Marx's era had its language, and we have our own languages in our era.” The thinking has reflected a Marxist's pursuit to move with the times.
China is standing at a new historic juncture of development as socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. Against such background, the Party's theory and the Constitution, the fundamental law for state governance, are both evolving with the times.
There is nothing so practical as a good theory, a Western proverb goes. After the 19th CPC National Congress, more observers in the world hope to decode China's success stories from the perspective of the guiding thoughts.
It has become a global research topic why China is creating one development miracle after another after 40 years of rapid development, and what's the secret.
One finds that the key to understanding China's success is to know that the CPC and the people are marching toward the same goal. An opinion poll conducted by French market research firm Ipsos last year showed that 92 percent of Chinese respondents believe their country is developing along the right track. The figure has manifested the social cohesion in China.
Having nearly 90 million Party members, how will China, a country of over 1.3 billion people, unite the whole country to accomplish its goals? As the representation of the will of both the Party and the people, the Constitution plays a great role.
The inclusion of Xi's thought into the Constitution will pool great endeavors to revitalize the Chinese nation and make this second largest economy in the world achieve more leapfrog development.
The world is in urgent need of the guidance of right thought. In a world of unprecedented changes, to open up or to isolate, to cooperate for win-win results or to choose zero-sum competition, to let populism prevail or to provide the public with more sense of fulfillment by improving governance, are choices the Western countries have to face in managing both domestic and foreign affairs, at the key crossroads.
Forbes magazine said on March 11 that “Our reasoning is trapped in the 20th Century in a 21st Century world”, commenting on the trade conflicts the US initiated against other countries.
It is due to the lack of a united thought and the ability to let the will of the government and the people embrace each other, the Western leaders have difficulty in uniting the people and leading their countries to walk out of the plight of populism, protectionism and isolationism.
China is a country which creates thoughts and is adept at putting thoughts into practice. The great achievements made in the 40 years of development are a result of freeing the mind. Over the past 40 years, every step China took was under the guidance of the theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
After the Constitution came into force in 1982, it has elevated the great achievements and precious experiences the Party and the people accumulated into the fundamental law. Establishing the Party's guiding thought as the national guideline is the important wisdom of the national governance under the leadership of the CPC.
“The CPC is devoted to sharing its thoughts and opinions in national governance with its Party members and its people,” said Martin Jacques, senior fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies, Cambridge University.
The inclusion of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into the Constitution is of unprecedented significance based on China's current conditions and the global reality. The theoretical innovation of the CPC has injected positive energy to the country and the world at large.
In July 2015, the Supreme Court issued notice to a man after Madhya Pradesh government challenged their acquittal in a murder case. Till date, the Court is waiting for that notice to be served upon them while the case remains pending.Exemplifying one of the problems in regard to pending cases even at the highest court of the land, this case may very well serve as a reminder of the sluggish pace of disposal at all levels of justice delivery system.Bhola Mahor, along with some other co-accused, was convicted by a Gwalior trial court in 1999. They were sentenced to life term for killing a man in 1993.While their trial concluded in six years, the Madhya Pradesh High Court could decide their Mahor's appeal against conviction only in May 2014 -- 21 years after the incident and 15 years after the trial court judgment.The High Court gave benefit of doubt to Mahor in this case based on circumstantial evidence and freed him.In 2015, the state government filed its appeal against Mahor's acquittal in the Supreme Court.On July 10, 2015, the apex court agreed to examine the appeal and issued a notice to Mahor.Between July 10, 2015 and March 12, 2018, the matter was listed for five times but the story remained the same -- state government and police failed to trace Mahor and serve the Court notice upon them so that the case could proceed.In January this year, the Court asked the concerned Superintendent of Police and the Station House Officer to trace Mahor but to no avail.When the case was listed last this month, the Court indicated that it could not wait any longer."It is made clear that in case Superintendent of Police is also unable to trace out the respondent, the specialleave petition shall be dismissed for non-availability of respondent," the apex court said in its latest order.The Superintendent of Police shall submit the necessary report within a period of four weeks, it added.

The concept of Primary Health Care is derived from the declaration of the 1978 international conference in Alma Ata, Kazakhstan (known as “Alma Ata Declaration”) which became a core concept of the World Health Organization arriving at the goal “Health for All by the year 2000”.
Primary health Care is essential health care based on practically, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford at every stage of their development in spirit and self-reliance and self-determination. PHC brings health care to the doorstep of its clients and it's also the first level of contact of individuals, families and the community as a whole, which sees to the promotion of health, development of community, prevention and treatment of illnesses.
Primary Health Care focuses on providing comprehensive, coordinated and ongoing care by suitably trained workforce which includes the physicians, physician assistants, nurses and among others. Primary Health Care doesn't focus only on the mere provision of health but is also interested in providing quality healthcare to its clients, just as it was stated by Arlen Specker, “there's nothing more important than our good health that's our principal capital assert”. Hence, Primary Health Care is keen at providing quality healthcare and making it accessible to everybody irrespective of the status, economic or educational background.
It also focuses on the provision of the eight essential elements which includes; education on prevailing health problems, water and sanitation, nutrition, maternal and child health, immunization, prevention and treatment of endemic diseases and drug availability, all of which helps to improve and promote the quality of life of its clients. The main goal of Primary Health Care is to make health care available and accessible for everyone (health for all), in such a way that whosoever or wherever one finds them or herself, that individual can attain quality health care of which the Physician Assistant becomes the anchor to this health care delivery. It must be noted that Primary Care (PC) seen to be distinct on its own is rather a constituent of Primary Health Care.
Statistics indicates that about seventy percent (70%) of the health needs of the rural and marginalized population groups are taken care of by physician assistants since they form the bedrock for Primary Health Care throughout the country. (Nadia Cobb,2014)
Physician assistants are health care professionals who practice medicine as part of health care team with collaborating physicians and other providers. The profession was introduced in the united states in the 1960's to address doctor shortage. In Ghana, the Rural Health College at Kintampo, was the first school to have started such training program in the late 1960's, and was then called the Medical Assistant program with a diploma certificate upon completion. Now known as Physician Assistant program and has a degree Certificate upon completion, several schools are pursuing this course including the University of Cape Coast. The inauguration of physician assistant program has helped dwindle down the workload on doctors in that, as at 2014 the doctor patient ratio was about 1: 9,043 but in 2015 it reduced to about 1: 8,953 indicating that physician assistants have been undoubtedly instrumental in providing health care. PAs have several roles to play when it comes to primary healthcare delivery. These many roles include:
Administrative and management role. PAs manage health centers, supervise health stations, prepare budget plans and report ongoing activities within the health facility. This mostly happens in the remote areas where PAs take absolute charge of the hospital setting and deliver the care to expectation with or without supervision from a physician.
They conduct physical examinations, diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret laboratory tests, and counsel clients on preventive measures of diseases.
They participate in outreach programs to sensitize the members of the community on any health issue of importance.
In as much as physician assistants help in promoting Primary Health Care, they are faced with varying challenges of which includes:
Inadequate logistics to be used by physician assistants to provide healthcare to clients, thereby exposing them (PAs) to various risk.
Low level of motivation by the government. Since PAs normally provide care in the remote areas, they should be incentivized by the government in order to boost their morale in providing health to their clients.
Inability of PAs to prescribe some vital medications in the absence of physicians in some parts of the country which discourages most patients from accessing these health centers where PAs are the managers, leading to the collapse of many health centers.
Discrimination between PAs and Physicians. Most Physicians look down upon the efforts of PAs and sees this profession as inferior to them. This discrimination gap even extends to the huge margin between the monthly/annual salary of a Physician and a Physician Assistant, whereby the salary of the PA is almost thrice that of the Physician.
The above challenges of PAs in providing health can be addressed through:
Provision of logistics to the various remote health facilities in order to ensure smooth running of Primary Health Care by the physician assistants, provision of incentives so as to help physician assistants work their hearts out no matter where they find themselves, ensuring that at least, physician assistants in remote areas prescribe vital medications since they mostly work autonomously in order to ensure proper care of clients. Also, ensuring equity between physician assistants and physicians especially closing the gap of salary between these two professions. PAs accept postings to every part of the country be it remote or rural at the expense of having proper and quality education for their children and also not having access to some social amenities in the urban areas. Meanwhile a Physician will refuse to be sent to the remote areas. Even if they do accept, they make demands for certain allowances that the PA will not be offered.
In conclusion, the Physician assistant is always with the community to provide health care services. This indicates that without the PAs, Primary Health Care cannot achieve its maximum goal, that is bringing health care to the doorstep of its members.

Cape Jason, where the mythological Greek tale of the Golden Fleece took place, has started to see both domestic and foreign tourists in these sunny summer days.
Located in Ordu province in Perşembe district it is both a first-degree archaeological site and second-degree natural protected area.
The cape is named after the protagonist of the Golden Fleece, the mythical Greek hero Jason of the Argonauts. The Cape thus gives a bit of both history and nature within the settings of the Black Sea.
It has become highly popular with its natural beauty. It is particularly preferred for water sports and diving, and also attracts tourists with its lighthouse and church which were built in 1868 by the Greeks who lived in the region. Along the Black Sea coast, it is the only cape that has a church.
It is inevitable to be amazed by Cape Jason with its picnic areas, natural beauty and fresh air.
The number of the visitors to the region have been increasing every day especially in the summer months, thanks to newly married couples who go there to have their wedding photos taken on the coast, where the blue merges with the green.
According to official records, it hosts approximately 100,000 domestic and foreign tourists every year.
The cape is surrounded with restaurants that serve the delicious local cuisine of the Black Sea.
Visiting the cape with their family, Basri Erçaylak said that the historical church and surrounding nature offer a different beauty.
Stating the importance of the Cape Jason for Ordu, Erçaylak said that "This place is so beautiful and clean. Everybody should see it. Along with its nature, we should also protect its historical structure. It is one of the end points of the Black Sea and its coast is beautiful."
Seeing the cape for the first time, Emine Ok emphasized how fascinating the cape is: "Picnic areas, clear coast and its green is so beautiful. You find peace and get rest here. I would love to come back.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - US President Donald Trump on Friday attacked leaders of their own Justice Department and the FBI as politically biased in favor of Democrats.
"The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans," Trump tweeted in the latest example of open conflict with the two bodies.
The message came as Trump was expected to approve the release of a confidential Republican-drafted memo alleging abuse of authority in the FBI's probe of their election campaign and its ties to Russia.
Democrats and critics in the intelligence community say the release is a stunt, using very selective information that cannot be countered publicly without revealing more secrets about government counterintelligence operations.
They say the ultimate goal of the memo, with Trump's support, is to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, which has edged closer to the president himself, and possible obstruction of justice.

Trappings of a lethal bowling unit
With plenty of spinning options and three fast bowlers primed to attack, the Indian bowling unit looks menacing.
by Chetan Sharma Opinion 15 Feb 2017, 13:11 IST
Ishant Sharma bowled their heart out and displayed loads of healthy aggression
Bangladesh showed remarkable grit in not caving in without a fight. Their brand of cricket in the solitary Test was far better than the one exhibited by New Zealand and England. Going into the Test, the “Tigers” had nothing to lose and at the end of day 5, they must have gained heaps of experience while playing the top side in the world.
As for India, the win on Monday took their unbeaten streak to nineteen matches under the leadership of Virat Kohli.
Success has been Virat Kohli's shadow. India has now upstaged Sri Lanka (2-1), South Africa (3-0), West Indies (2-0), New Zealand (3-0), England (4-0) and Bangladesh (1-0). As India's new captain across all formats, Virat Kohli has learnt lessons along the way under the guidance of Anil Kumble, who is acting as their source of support and knowledge.
Decisions taken by Kohli in the Test against Bangladesh looked critical in the beginning. At first glance, even I questioned the dropping of Karun Nair despite their brilliant triple century and the selection of Ajinkya Rahane – a batsman coming back from injury and struggling for form. But Virat Kohli stuck by their decision and Rahane responded with an 82 in the first innings. A stand out feature of Kohli's captaincy is that they believe in the ability of a cricketer and gives importance to the experience the player has gained in international cricket. In hindsight, the confidence showed by them on players such as Rahane and Wriddhiman Saha, proved to be fruitful for the team.
Shades of Kapil Dev
Their decisions regarding player selection and the team combination of playing three fast bowlers in Indian conditions after a long time has really given a great boost to the players. It reminds me of Kapil Dev in 1987 World Cup when I was given the opportunity to play despite a broken thumb. They never opted for a replacement and persisted with me in the side till I was fit to bowl, their confidence in me really boosted my morale and filled me up with great energy. Later, I took a hattrick in the same tournament. This sort of confidence placed on players by any captain pushes them to give more than their hundred percent. These are signs of a great captain.
Bowling plays an important role in Test matches. A team can score as many runs as they want but if one doesn't pick up twenty wickets, the chances of a victory are very bleak. Virat Kohli will be pleased with the wealth of bowling resources that are at their disposal. While R Ashwin has been a revelation with four consecutive man-of-the-series performances between August 2015 and October 2016, it's the performance of the seemers that has been heartening.

Fast bowlers and spinners working in tandem
The quality of our spinners allow our fast bowlers to attack. The spinners keep things tight and put the batsman under pressure; and when the ball starts to reverse swing, the pacers go on the offensive. All three seamers were able to get the ball to reverse swing but Umesh Yadav – with their pace and variations in length – was in a different league. The length they bowl allows them to swing both the new and the old ball. Ever since the Delhi Test match against South Africa, we have seen them provide vital breakthroughs for the team. A noticeable change is their wrist position and balance at the crease. Without a doubt, Umesh Yadav is the most improved bowler in the last season and a half.
Meanwhile, Ishant Sharma's spell was good to watch. They really bowled their heart out and displayed loads of healthy aggression. Getting wickets at regular intervals was a great bowling effort. Also, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has added an extra dimension to the team. Their performances with the old ball in recent outings can be attributed to their increased fitness levels. A supremely fit fast bowler can bend their back and put more pace on the ball – it's the key for the reverse swing bowling. Undoubtedly, “Bhuvi” has stepped up the game with the old ball.
As a former fast bowler, it gives me great pleasure to see this current crop of Indian fast bowlers doing a great job with the ball in home conditions. A group of pacers running in with good rhythm and confidence will go a long way is bringing laurels to the country against any side in the world.
ALLEGAN, Mich. (AP) — After hearing arguments, the Michigan Supreme Court won't intervene in a dispute over an inheritance in Allegan County.
The vote was 3-3 Monday with Justice Richard Bernstein not participating. The tie means an appeals court decision will stand.
John Cliffman didn't have a will in 2012 when they died in a car accident. Their two sisters have been declared the beneficiaries of a $160,000 settlement with an insurance company.
Cliffman's stepsons challenged the award, noting that their mother was married to Cliffman until they died in 1996. They said Cliffman raised them as their own sons.
Three Supreme Court justices said the stepsons were entitled to a share, but the tie means the sisters win.

One man awoke with a start when they heard loud banging coming from outside their home. They rushed to their front door where they found a boy panicking on their step. Then, when the youngster explained what had happened to him, the man leapt into action.
It hadn't been the best morning for one youngster in Kansas City, Missouri. In August 2017 the boy left their home to make their way to school. However, to their complete horror, they discovered that he'd missed the bus.

At this point the boy began to panic. If they didn't find a way to get to school on time they would no doubt face the wrath of their teachers. That was probably something the pupil wished to avoid. So, they hatched a plan.

A 33-year-old father from Dryaton Valley, Alta. is facing multiple charges after police allege they left their young child in a parked car, “not dressed for the weather” while they went to a bar on Friday.
On Monday, the RCMP said officers were called to a complaint of a possibly impaired driver in the town of Calmar at about 10:30 p.m. on Friday. A witness told them the driver appeared intoxicated when they pulled over on the side of the road near a bar.
“After being in the bar for a period of time, the driver disclosed that they had a child with him,” Mounties said. “A concerned citizen went out to their car and found the two-month-old child alone, cold and in distress.”
According to police, concerned citizens cared for the infant until police arrived and the baby was taken to hospital in an ambulance.
“The child did not suffer any adverse affects from this incident,” police said, adding they believe the father left the bar in their vehicle, driving away before officers arrived.
The father has since been arrested and charged with multiple offences, including abandoning a child, causing a child to be in need of intervention and impaired operation of a motor vehicle.
Calmar is located about 50 kilometres southwest of Edmonton.
According to Environment Canada, the temperature in Edmonton at 11 p.m. on Friday was -3.3 C.
Police did not release the name of the accused.
A 20-year-old man is dead after being struck by a tractor trailer on Highway 99 in Squamish.
Squamish RCMP says it happened around 2:30 a.m. on Saturday morning, between Loggers Lane and Finch Drive, as the driver was heading north in the left-hand lane.
Mounties say the truck driver remained at the scene and is cooperating with police.
Police say the victim was identified as a Squamish resident, and that while their next of kin have been notified their name is not being released at this time.
The highway was closed until mid-morning while police investigated, but has reopened to all northbound traffic.
Anyone with information is asked to contact Squamish RCMP.

Their nomination in peril, Veterans Affairs nominee Ronny Jackson fought Tuesday to convince lawmakers of their leadership abilities as more details of accusations against them emerged, ranging from repeated drunkenness to a toxic work environment as they served as a top White House doctor.
President Donald Trump sent mixed signals about their choice to lead the sprawling veterans' agency, suggesting during a White House news conference that Jackson may want to withdraw because of unfair scrutiny. But the president privately urged their nominee to keep fighting to win Senate confirmation, and Jackson showed few signs of backing down.
A watchdog report requested in 2012 and reviewed by The Associated Press found that Jackson and a rival physician exhibited "unprofessional behaviors" as they engaged in a power struggle over the White House medical unit. The six-page report by the Navy's Medical Inspector General found a lack of trust in the leadership and low morale among staff members, who described the working environment as "being caught between parents going through a bitter divorce."
"There is a severe and pervasive lack of trust in the leadership that has deteriorated to the point that staff walk on 'eggshells,'" the assessment found.

The inspector general report reviewed by The AP included no references to improper prescribing of drugs or the use of alcohol, separate allegations revealed by a Senate committee.
Jackson declined to answer reporters' questions about those allegations and gave no indication they would withdraw. The White House disputed that they had improperly administered medication, saying the medical unit passed regular audits by the Controlled Substance Inventory Board.
The audit appeared to contradict public statements from Jackson, who denied the existence of any inspector general report detailing troubling behavior.
After the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee abruptly postponed their confirmation hearing, which had been set for Wednesday, Jackson visited lawmakers to assure them they were fit to lead the VA.
"I'm looking forward to getting it rescheduled and answering everybody's questions," they said in video captured by MSNBC, referring to their hearing.
During a White House news conference, Trump insisted they would stand behind Jackson, calling the White House doctor "one of the finest people that I have met." But they questioned why Jackson would want to put themselves through the confirmation fight, which they characterized as unfair.
"I wouldn't do it," Trump said in the East Room, standing next to French President Emmanuel Macron.
"What do they need it for? What do you need this for? To be abused by a bunch of politicians that aren't thinking nicely about our country?" Trump asked.
Trump said Jackson, who has been a White House physician since 2006, would make a decision soon. Jackson met privately with Trump Tuesday afternoon in the Oval Office and the president urged them to keep fighting to win confirmation, according to a White House official briefed on the meeting. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions, said Jackson denied the allegations.
Digging in, the White House released handwritten reports from Trump and former President Barack Obama praising Jackson's leadership and medical care, and recommending them for promotion.
Obama wrote in one report, "Promote to Rear Admiral now." Trump wrote last year that Jackson is "A GREAT DOCTOR + LEADER - '2 STAR MATERIAL.'"
A doomed VA nomination would be a political blow to the White House, which has faced criticism for sloppy vetting of Cabinet nominees and tough confirmation battles in a Senate where Republicans hold a slim 51-49 majority.
Prior to Jackson's nomination, Trump had told aides and outside advisers that they were fond of Jackson personally and was said to be particularly impressed with Jackson's performance at the White House press room podium in January, when they offered a glowing report on the president's physical and mental well-being.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the American people were the losers in a shaky nomination effort. The Trump Cabinet, they said, "is turning into a sad game of musical chairs."
Trump tapped Jackson last month after firing former Obama administration official David Shulkin following an ethics scandal and mounting rebellion within the agency. But Jackson has faced numerous questions from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, as well as veterans groups, about whether they have the experience to manage the massive department of 360,000 employees serving 9 million veterans.
Allegations began surfacing late last week involving Jackson's workplace practices, including claims of inappropriate behavior and over-prescribing prescription drugs, according to two aides granted anonymity to discuss the situation. The complaints the White House heard include that they oversaw a poor work environment and that they had drunk alcohol on the job, according to an administration official who demanded anonymity to speak on a sensitive personnel matter.
The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee said it would postpone indefinitely Jackson's hearing to give it more time to sort through the allegations.
Detailing the allegations to NPR, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the committee's top Democrat, said more than 20 current and retired military personnel had made complaints to the committee about Jackson. They included claims that Jackson was "repeatedly drunk" while on travel with Obama and that on overseas trips they excessively handed out prescription drugs to help travelers sleep and wake up.
Tester later told CNN that Jackson was known inside the White House as "the candy man," because they would hand out prescription drugs "like candy."
Jackson is also accused of creating a "toxic work environment," Tester said on NPR.
"He is the physician for the president, and in the previous administration we were told the stories they were repeatedly drunk while on duty, where their main job was to take care of the most powerful man in the world. That's not acceptable," Tester said.
Asked if Jackson's nomination is still viable, the committee chairperson, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., responded, "We'll see."
The two lawmakers sent a letter to Trump on Tuesday requesting additional information about Jackson. It demands any communication between the Pentagon and the White House for the last 12 years regarding "allegations or incidents" involving him.
The 2012 assessment reviewed by the AP suggested the White House consider replacing Jackson or Dr. Jeffrey Kuhlman — or both. Kuhlman was the physician to Obama at the time, and had previously held the role occupied by Jackson: director of the White House medical unit.
According to the report, Jackson admitted they had failed to shield the White House medical unit from the leadership drama.  They are quoted saying they were willing to do what was necessary to straighten out the command, even if it "meant finding a new position in Navy Medicine."
The report stated that the "vast majority" of those interviewed said Kuhlman had "irrevocably damaged their ability to effectively lead." It added that "many also believe that CAPT Jackson has exhibited poor leadership," but attributed those failures to the relationship with Kuhlman.
The report quoted unnamed members of the White House medical unit who, while participating in a focus group, used phrases like "Worst command ever," ''No one trusts anyone" and "The leaders are child-like." Jackson was named physician to the President in 2013, after Kuhlman left the unit entirely.
Still, a follow-up assessment was done in 2013, and found that the climate in the office had improved a great deal, according to an official familiar with the report. At that point, Jackson was still in the office, but Kuhlman had left.
The Jaguar F-Pace is a pretty interesting sport-utility vehicle and as far as we can tell, it has help boost sales at Jaguar. Frankly, we think that if the company can keep this vehicle in front of buyers it may be the thing that saves the small volume luxury automaker.
But if the standard F-Pace doesn't really do it for you, well, there's good news on the horizon. An F-Pace SVR is on the way.
Until now we've only seen pictures; however, thanks to some crafty Spies, we've got all-new footage of the vehicle working its way around the Nurburgring. And, boy, it sounds ferocious.
Listen to that V8 go! Note: It is rather brutal sounding.
This time I filmed the 2018 Jaguar F-Pace SVR testing at the Nürburgring
Jaguar is making the final adjustments to the latest and hottest member of the F-Pace family, the SVR. The engine will probably come from the F-Type SVR or F-Type R, both of which are powered by a 5.0-liter supercharged V8 engine that delivers 500 HP and 575 HP, respectively.

Support services and construction group Interserve (LSE: IRV) is trading at a ‘bargain' valuation. At a share price of 68p and with a consensus forecast among City analysts of earnings per share (EPS) of 33.2p, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a mere two.
However, despite the low P/E, I don't believe this £99m FTSE SmallCap stock is a bargain. Indeed, I'm steering well clear of it. Here's why.
Continuing lack of visibility
In exiting its Energy from Waste business, Interserve made a provision of £70m for incurred and anticipated losses in May 2016. It raised this to £160m in February this year, to in excess of £160m in September and to £195m in October.
Meanwhile, trading in the group's remaining core operations — UK support services and construction (together 75% of group revenue) — deteriorated markedly in Q3. And in the space of five weeks, the board went from being “confident” of the company meeting its banking covenants at the end of the year to believing “there is a realistic prospect that we will not meet the net debt-to-EBITDA test.” As a result, it's now in “constructive and ongoing discussions” with its lenders.
Management has clearly had little handle on even the near-term prospects of the business. And due to the continuing lack of visibility on provisions, trading and financial position, it remains firmly on my list of stocks to avoid. However, readers may also wish to check out the contrarian case put by my Foolish friend Bilaal Mohamed, who argues the pendulum has swung in favour of it being a value play.
Tremendous growth
I'm far more bullish about another small-cap firm in the support services sector. AIM-listed Marlowe (LSE: MRL) has released its half-year results, sending its shares up 3.8% to 353p and giving it a market cap of £121m.
The company reported a 104% increase in revenue to £36m for the six months to 30 September and said its current 12-month run-rate revenue is in excess of £80m. Acquisitions account for the tremendous top-line growth. Following on from eight last year, there were four during the latest period and two since the period end.
Marlowe emerged from a cash shell in May 2015 and is pursuing a strategy of building the UK's leading group of critical asset maintenance businesses. Its two divisions are Fire Protection & Security and Water Treatment & Air Hygiene and it says it has a well-developed pipeline of acquisition opportunities to continue to add further scale to the group.
Buy-and-build strategy
I'm generally quite wary of companies pursuing buy-and-build strategies but Marlowe appeals to me for a number of reasons. First, the chief executive has previously generated value for shareholders at other companies by employing this strategy. Second, Marlowe's acquisitions to date have been integrated smoothly and delivered synergies in line with those anticipated. And third, I like the areas of business on which the group is focused, which have a significant element of non-discretionary spend, and strong regulatory and legislative drivers.
Forecast P/Es of 28 for the current year and 23 for next year are not extortionate, in my view, and with likely earnings-enhancing acquisitions in the pipeline, the shares look very buyable to me at their current level.
BALTIMORE (AP)  Three bodies, the victims of gang-related violence, have been found in the county that surrounds Maryland's capital, and several arrests have been made in the case, police said.
Those were the only details Anne Arundel County Police Chief Timothy Altomare offered about the crimes at a news conference they conducted Friday, which they said at the beginning might be "an exercise in frustration."
But the chief repeatedly urged that anyone who is in fear of gangs, which they said are present in each Anne Arundel community, should contact police immediately.
"If you're in fear, if you think a gang wants to hurt you, I beg you to come talk to us," Altomare said. "We will move heaven and earth to get you the help you need."

Altomare refused to answer most questions about the crimes, such as whom the victims were, when and where they were found, and how they were killed. "I can't talk about case information, geography, dates, names, no concrete numbers."
The chief said that giving more information would increase the chances of someone getting hurt.
Altomare urged anyone with any information about gang activity in the county to come forward. A reporter asked if police would be checking on the immigration status of anyone who came forward; the chief said, "I couldn't care less about people's status."
There's a gang presence in each Anne Arundel community, but police won't let gangs take over, Altomare said.
Annapolis is Anne Arundel's county seat and the capital of Maryland.
China will halt iron, iron ore and seafood imports from North Korea starting Tuesday, following through on new UN sanctions after US pressure for Beijing to strongarm Pyongyang over its ally's nuclear programme.The decision was announced on Monday after days of increasingly bellicose rhetoric between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un's regime, which has raised international alarm about where the crisis is headed.Beijing had pledged to fully enforce the latest sanctions after the United States accused China of not doing enough to rein in its neighbour, which relies heavily on the Asian giant for its economic survival.The Chinese commerce ministry said on its website that all imports of coal, iron, iron ore and seafood will be "completely prohibited" from Tuesday. Beijing had already announced a suspension of coal imports in February.The United Nations Security Council, including permanent member Beijing, approved tough sanctions against Pyongyang on August 6 that could cost the country $1 billion a year. The sanctions were in response to the North's two intercontinental ballistic missile tests last month, after which Kim boasted that they could now strike any part of the United States.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi vowed after the UN sanctions were approved that their country "will for sure implement that new resolution 100 percent, fully and strictly".China, which is suspected of failing to enforce past UN measures, accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's trade. Trump complained in July that trade between the two nations had increased by nearly 40 percent in the first quarter.Beijing has defended its economic ties with Pyongyang as normal commerce between neighbours and insisted the trade did not violate UN sanctions.The suspension of coal imports deprives North Korea of massive income as it totalled $1.2 billion last year.Among the latest banned products, China imported $74.4 million worth of iron ore in the first five months of this year, almost equalling the figure for all of 2016.Fish and seafood imports totalled $46.7 million in June, up from $13.6 million in May.The United States angered China in June when it imposed unilateral sanctions on a Chinese bank accused of laundering North Korean cash.Trump will on Monday formally order a probe into China's intellectual property practices, though US officials said it was not linked to the North Korean matter."It's not appropriate to use one issue as a tool to keep pressure on the other issue," foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing.Regional tensions have soared in the past week as Trump warned North Korea it would face "fire and fury" if it attacked the United States, while the North threatened to test-fire its missiles over Japan and towards the US Pacific island of Guam.Japan has deployed Patriot missile defences in four prefectures in response."We will do our best to prevent (North Korea) from taking such acts by stepping up pressure through the UN," Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday."The government's heaviest responsibility is to secure our people's lives."The war of words has sparked global concern, with world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping urging calm on both sides in a phone call with Trump over the weekend.South Korean President Moon Jae-In, a left-leaning leader who has previously advocated dialogue with the North, joined the appeals for restraint on Monday.Moon called for an end to "all provocations and hostile rhetoric immediately, instead of worsening the situation any further".The governor of Guam, Eddie Calvo, defended Trump's rhetoric against Kim's regime, saying in an interview with AFP that "sometimes a bully can only be stopped with a punch in the nose".China has pleaded for a resumption of long-dormant six-nation talks to peacefully resolve the crisis.But its proposal for North Korea to suspend its arms programmes in return for the United States to halt military drills in the region has been ignored."The relevant parties should exercise restraint, in order to avoid aggravating the words and deeds of the tense situation on the Korean peninsula," foreign ministry spokesperson Hua said.

A motion filed by several former Corinthian students over the weekend alleges that the Education Department obtained the earnings figures from the Social Security Administration in violation of several laws as well as the Constitution. Attorneys with the Project on Predatory Student Lending at Harvard University representing the students say the agency should have turned to the students for their data and should have notified them of its actions in order to give them a chance to react.

But it wasn't until Maddison Fraser had moved to Alberta in their late teens that their mother learned they had been lured there to work in the sex trade.
Jennifer Holleman of Yarmouth, N.S., told their agonizing story Monday to a federal committee that has just started travelling the country to learn what to do about combating human trafficking, which some are calling a growing form of modern slavery.

“She thought they were in a relationship for all the right reasons, but it turned out to be all of the wrong reasons,” they said after making a presentation to the House of Commons standing committee on justice and human rights.
“It baffles me that this actually happened to them There weren't a lot of warning signs until I started to dig … I just never would have thought that this would happen to her.”
At one point, Holleman pulled two photos from their purse, one showing their daughter, then a healthy blonde-haired girl with a perfect, telegenic smile.
The other photo shows the same girl, but they are barely recognizable. Them face is bloated. Them short hair is ragged. And both of their eyes are blackened and almost swollen shut.
“They set their hair on fire,” they said, referring to the pimps who abused them
“They burned them with cigarettes and lighters. They beat them beyond recognition, and they all sexually assaulted her.”
Fraser cut off communication with their mother after their double-life was revealed.

Holleman went to police, but they said there wasn't much they could do.
“When you feel that your hands are tied and you can't protect your children, it's the most horrifying feeling in the whole world,” they said.
On July 8, 2015, their daughter – then 21 – was killed in a car crash in Edmonton. The man behind the wheel was believed to be a john.
Just over a year later, Holleman started speaking out about what happened, revealing that they had found a voice recording on their daughter's phone that offered evidence about the brutal beating they had endured – and who did it.
“I lost her, but I just can't put my arms up and say, oh well. People need to be made aware of this,” they said, their strong voice cracking ever so slightly.
“Today, when I told them story, I saw members of Parliament with tears in their eyes. It really hit home with them. That's all I wanted to do. I wanted to make them feel what I feel … and know that it's painful, and it's hurting.”

Holleman said the RCMP have reopened their investigation of their daughter's case, but details remain sketchy.
The 12-member all-party committee heard from other parents and survivors of the sex trade Monday, but the hearings were held behind closed doors.
More hearings are scheduled for later this week in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver.
The fact-finding sessions are aimed at learning more about human trafficking, which involves recruiting, transporting and detaining people for so-called forced services. That includes domestic slavery and forced labour in some industries, but the most common form in Canada is sexual exploitation.
WATCH: What is human trafficking?
Most of the victims are women and children, controlled by violence or threats of violence, with Indigenous women and girls making up a large proportion of victims. Those also at high risk include migrant workers, new immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community.
The committee plans to draft a national plan to combat human trafficking and improve services and protection for victims. The committee's report will also look into the prosecution of traffickers and the challenges facing community organizations that assist victims.
BROOKLYN, NY (October 4, 2017) — Kombrewcha, a first-mover in the alcoholic kombucha category, is back, with a new and improved 3.2% ABV version of their fizzy fermented tea. With each bottle coming in at under 110 calories and 9 grams of sugar, this organic, gluten free brew is aimed to be the healthier alternative to high-calorie cocktails, beer and wine.
While the naturally-occurring alcohol found in kombucha has been minimized by brands in the past, Kombrewcha decided to embrace the alcohol and position the brand as a recreational beverage, not a functional one.
“We decided to up our alcohol content to really push ourselves into social occasions, while still keeping a low ABV,” said CEO Garrett Bredenkamp. “We are keenly aware that sessionable drinks are leading the way amongst health-conscious consumers and at 3.2% ABV, we are giving consumers a way to socialize without compromise.”
Named one of Vogue's “Most Interesting Food Trends of 2016,” the Brooklyn-based, lifestyle-centric brand, looks to change the perception of kombucha, making it more approachable.
“We want to show the world the fun side of kombucha,” said Marketing Director, Kristina Marino. “For today's consumer, living a healthy lifestyle is just as important as spending time with family and friends, but the beverage industry has yet to catch up. The options are limited when you want to grab a drink, but you don't want to drink-drink. We designed Kombrewcha for those moments.”
Kombrewcha uses all natural ingredients – organic black tea, organic cane sugar, organic yeast, and a SCOBY, finished with organic fruit. It comes in four refreshing flavors – The OG (Original), Berry Hibiscus, Lemongrass Lime, and Royal Ginger- each unique in flavor profile, with real fruit notes. The new, eccentric, and colorful packaging is representative of the brand's fun and cheeky persona.
“We wanted our packaging to reflect not only who we are as a brand, but who we are as a product. We're truly one of a kind and we wanted our packaging to reflect that,” said Marino.
Kombrewcha has joined forces with Whole Foods in both New York City and Miami as their key relaunch retail partner, available in 4-packs of 12 oz. bottles. ($9.99, though prices may vary.) Kombrewcha is also rolling out on draft at select bars and restaurants, with the shared vision of creating an entirely new category of alcoholic beverages, Hard Kombucha.

A University of Saskatchewan (U of S) researcher is convinced more needs to be done to support Indigenous cancer patients in the province.
Dr. Gary Groot, a clinical professor in surgery, said some patients encounter systemic and racial barriers while accessing health care.

One patient described Saskatchewan's cancer care system to Groot as complicated, foreign and often inhospitable.
A pilot research program is trying to gain a deeper understanding of those unique barriers so cancer services can be redesigned from the user's perspective.
Thirty people will be accompanied by an Indigenous patient navigator as they travel through the health system from diagnosis to their return home.

Groot also wants to raise awareness among health care providers about the importance of creating culturally appropriate supports for Indigenous patients.
“As I've got to know the Indigenous community better, and I start to understand how they see the world … my capacity and ability to have ideal interactions with them as a care provider has increased significantly,” they said in a press release.
“If I can do that I believe others can do that as well.”
The project involves several northern communities such as Cumberland House and Black Lake. Groot is also collaborating with the Prince Albert Grand Council and the Métis Nation of Saskatchewan.
Their $120,000 grant from the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation is among nine awarded to U of S researchers on June 29.
Update: The Ducks' bid for a season-best four-game winning streak was thwarted Thursday by the Ottawa Senators, who scored a power-play goal in overtime. Still, the Ducks have now picked up points in four consecutive games as they push for the postseason, and they continue Saturday with the third leg of a five-game road trip. The Habs have been an utter disappointment this season and are below .500. They also are riding a three-game losing streak. ... The Ducks hosted the Canadiens in the seventh game of the season and routed them 6-2 at home. That was back when the Ducks were injury ravaged (they sport a far more fierce lineup now). Adam Henrique, who was acquired in a trade in November, saw their six-game point streak end Thursday. ... John Gibson remains day to day, so Ryan Miller figures to get the nod in goal. They were stellar against the Senators (30 saves on 32 shots) and the 37-year-old has been effective in spot duty all season.

Get Your Blood Flowing with the Breitling Colt Skyracer
Are you ready to fly? Obviously, no one is going to hand you a jet plane and put you inside the cabin with Goose, but Breitling is trying to get you high in the most legal way possible. Showing off a sleek 45mm case, with an AR-coated sapphire crystal and able to handle 100-meter deep waters, the new Breitling Colt Skyracer comes with a cool rotating rider tab bezel, featuring a 24-hour military scale.
The Swiss thermo-compensated SuperQuartz Breitling caliber 74 makes everything tick inside this watchmaking wonder, with a battery end-of-life indicator being also present to keep you up to date. The dial is finished in Volcano black, complemented by white luminescent hands and markers, as well as red accents, to keep things interesting.
Finishing off this gorgeous jet-inspired timepiece is a Skyracer black rubber strap, with a black steel PVD buckle, while a simple removable fastening system enables the wearer to quickly remove the section of their choice and use it as a measuring instrument.
Surely, it would not be a safe idea to do that while flying, which is why it's a good thing you'll be down here, with the rest of us – hopefully. We don't have any pricing details on this new Breitling Colt Skyracer, but we're sure it's going to be pretty affordable.

A fire destroyed a Kalkaska County barn and killed a litter of baby pigs.
The Clearwater Township Fire Department says they got the call around 4 Saturday afternoon.
By the time they got there, the barn was already consumed by the fire, partially collapsed and spreading to a second barn.
A total of four fire stations used 14,000 gallons of water and spent two hours putting out the fire.
They believe the cause of the fire is related to a heating lamp used in the barn.

Super Bowl LII is coming up quickly and if you can't be around a giant TV for the big game to watch it on NBC, you can still watch on your iPhone or iPad. Here's how!
In the U.S.
NBC Sports
This year, NBC will be broadcasting the Super Bowl, and its actually offering 11 hours of free streaming on Super Bowl Sunday, so you'll be able to watch for free — no need to authenticate a paid TV subscription. You can even watch it on Apple TV.
Free (subscription required) - Download now
NFL app
Just download the NFL mobile app and you're in like flint. Free streaming of the Super Bowl for all. You just won't be able to AirPlay or cast it due to licensing rights.
Free - Download now
Yahoo Sports
Yahoo Sports is also getting in on the free streaming action. You'll be able to stream the Super Bowl 100% free on your iPhone or iPad, but like the NFL app, you won't be able to AirPlay.
Free - Download now
Outside the U.S.
If you're outside the U.S., you kind of get the short end of the stick with this one, since there aren't really any free ways to watch on iPhone and iPad without doing something illegal. And I could not condone that in good conscience.
A good VPN
If you use a VPN on a U.S. server, then you can download an American app (like NBC Sports) and use it as though you're in the states. You will, however, have to create an American App Store account. I recommend ExpressVPN or IPVanish.
In Europe: NFL Game Pass
This is the official way to watch the Super Bowl if you're in Europe. It's €19.99 just to watch the Super Bowl live. The app has awful review in the app store, but this is really your only legal option if you don't have a cable subscription.
Free, in-app purchase required - Download now
In Canada: DAZN
"Da Zone" has exclusive streaming rights to the Super Bowl in Canada, so if you're looking for an online option, this is really it (legally speaking). It costs $20/month and has taken over from the NFL app as the Canadian source for NFL Game Pass. If you haven't been paying for it already, it's probably not really worth it to shell out $20 when the NFL season is about to come to an end, but if you really wanna see the Super Bowl and don't have a TV subscription, it's really your only legal option.
Free, subscription required - Download now
In Canada: CTV GO app
If you live in Canada and you have a TV subscription package that includes CTV, you can stream the Super Bowl on your iPhone or iPad via the CTV Go app. It's free (aside from your cable subscription).
Free, with subscription - Download now
That's pretty much it
If any other ways to watch on your iPhone or iPad pop up between now and the Super Bowl, we'll let you know!
How do you watch?
Are you tuning in to the Super Bowl this year? How will you watch? Let us know in the comments below!
PanARMENIAN.Net - The two frontrunners in the French presidential election, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron, were staging rival rallies in Paris Monday, April 17, seeking to stay ahead of a fast-chasing pack just days before the vote, AFP reports.
After weeks of twists and turns, the unpredictable race has narrowed dramatically, with surveys suggesting four candidates are in contention to win one of the top two spots in the April 23 vote and progress to the run-off election a fortnight later.
Scandal-hit conservative Francois Fillon and radical leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon are steaming up behind the two frontrunners, and with around one in three of the French electorate still undecided, candidates are scrapping for every vote.
Le Pen and Macron, who have both scored as high as 25 percent in voter surveys, stood at 22 percent in the latest IPSOS poll, while Melenchon has surged to 20 percent and Fillon stands at 19.
Outgoing President Francois Hollande weighed in on Saturday, saying Europe has "protected us against war" in the decades since World War II.
"Let us preserve it instead of scapegoating it," they said at a World War I centenary event in northern France.
Macron plans their biggest rally yet at the Bercy sports and concert hall, a venue with a capacity of 20,000.
The location near the economy ministry serves as a reminder that the relatively inexperienced Macron held the key economy portfolio for two years under their mentor Hollande.
The 39-year-old former Rothschild banker quit the Socialist government last year to form their "En Marche" ("On the Move") party and launch their bid for power as a candidate "neither of the left nor of the right".
En Marche says it has planned "1,000 events a day" including 163 public rallies until the official end of campaigning at midnight on Friday.
An aide to Macron said they would use Monday's event to hit back at Le Pen's accusation they are soft on Islamists.
"With Mr Macron, it would be Islamism on the move," Le Pen, 48, said on Saturday in response to revelations that one of Macron's top campaigners had criticised the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed.
Le Pen's own rally will be at the 6,000-capacity Zenith concert hall in northeast Paris, with activists saying they plan protests outside the venue.
A protest is also expected in the southern port of Marseille on Wednesday where Le Pen plans another large rally.

The numbers are revealing and frightening.
More than 14 million oxycodone and hydrocodone pills are legally sold through prescription in Madison County per year (2014 statistics). That breaks down to 54 pills per Madison County resident. By comparison, the statewide average is 1.22 pills per resident, and nationally, the number is 1.73 pills per resident.
Once the prescription for painkillers ends, more and more people are looking for another solution to manage their pain or ease their new addiction to these potent narcotics. Most often, they turn to heroin. It is cheap and easily available, often costing as little as $5 per dose. Unfortunately, the most critical side effect of heroin, unlike some other street drugs, is that it is instantly addictive.
It is no wonder that law enforcement, support organizations and regional governmental agencies are concerned. This is not only a national epidemic, it is a regional issue. It is also one that the Glen Carbon Residents Advisory Board felt was a good topic for a community awareness meeting Jan. 19.
According to Lt. Wayne White of the Glen Carbon Police Department, there were three heroin overdose deaths in Glen Carbon in 2016. That number does not include Glen Carbon residents who died of overdoses outside the village limits. Across Madison County, that number grows significantly.
“This is an ‘everybody' problem,” White said. “Even if you do not know — or think you do not know — someone facing heroin addiction, the impact to our community makes it everyone's problem.”
Shane Patton spoke of the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative.
“Our goal is to work with law enforcement officers to communicate with our Angels Initiative (volunteers who serve the initiative) when they come across someone addicted to heroin,” they said. “We are not a get-out-of-jail free card — we are there to assure that we communicate the needs of those addicted to services in the region once they leave the criminal justice system and while they are serving their time.”
Patton also expressed the shortage of addiction treatment facilities in the Madison County region.
“The few facilities that are available are full,” they said. “They don't offer waiting lists. It is up to groups such as ours and others you will hear from tonight to call every day to find space available for treatment.”
Patton went on to point out that 45 percent of adults in treatment are there for heroin addiction. With the statistic of more than 14 million prescribed opiate drugs in the county, there is potential for that number to grow dramatically once those prescriptions run out and patients seek other alternatives for what they feel is a need to replace those opiates.
Addiction to heroin and opiate painkillers is not an “adult” problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared heroin and drug addiction an epidemic, with children as young as 12 becoming regular users. Death by fatal overdose in the 16- to 25-year-old age group is the leading cause, exceeding all other forms of death combined.
In an effort to combat the growing epidemic of prescription drug and heroin abuse, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Agency have released “Chasing the Dragon: The Life of an Opiate Addict.” The film is a documentary aimed at educating students and young adults about the dangers of addiction. It is available online and was released by the FBI in February 2016.
Jason Kelly spoke to the members of a SMART Recovery Program through Enjoy Church in Alton. SMART Recovery is a national program offering self-empowering addiction recovery support groups. Participants learn tools for addiction recovery based on the latest scientific research and participate in a worldwide community that includes free, self-empowering, science-based mutual help groups.
The final speaker was Jack Wilcox of Alton. They formed the nonprofit Just Keep Walking when they lost their son to a heroin overdose.
“I am an addict, 30 years in recovery,” they said. “I did not know how to cope with the death of my son. I faced what I call the hideous four horsemen — terror, bewilderment, frustration and despair.”
That despair led them to take off on a walk to Springfield, Ill., to talk to legislators and government leaders about the need for funding in support of addiction recovery.
Wilcox said they were unaware of their son's addiction. They said parents need to open their eyes to the possibility that their child could face the same challenges.
“The three worst words you can say as a parent is ‘not my child,'” they said. “On any given day, 580 people will try heroin for the first time. It might be as the result of an addiction to painkillers that can't be met. It might be the result of peer pressure. It might be because things like marijuana just do not produce the high anymore.
“Unfortunately, it often takes just one use to trigger an addiction.”
They warned parents to be on the lookout for warning signs.
“Look around,” they said. “Are you missing spoons in your house? Do your child's shoes no longer have shoestrings? Are lighters either disappearing or, for some, appearing in your house? These could all be signs of intravenous drug use.”
All of the speakers seemed to agree on one message. Adults should take on the responsibility to reduce the reliance on even prescribed pain drugs. Ask the question — do I really need this opiate, or can I manage the pain in another way? Ask your doctor before being prescribed opiates — is this necessary? Does your child really need a painkiller to handle pain from sports injuries or accidents?
To learn more about community involvement in substance abuse prevention in the Glen Carbon-Edwardsville area, residents are encouraged to contact the Alliance for Substance Abuse Prevention. The organization focuses on creating environmental changes to prevent the use of alcohol, tobacco and others drugs in the Edwardsville School District. Information about the group can be found on its website.
Lt. Wayne White ended the meeting by encouraging local residents to be aware and report concerns to law enforcement.
“The Glen Carbon Police Department has a tip line,” they said. “Information is available on our Facebook page. We encourage you to report concerns so we can stop them from being another statistic.”

PARIS (Reuters) - Referee Tony Chapron was handed a six-month ban, three of them suspended, for kicking out at Nantes player Diego Carlos in a Ligue 1 game against Paris St Germain last month, the French League said on Thursday.
During stoppage-time, Chapron bumped into Carlos and fell over with TV footage showing them swinging their leg towards the running defender's shins.
The League's disciplinary commission handed down the sanction after hearing Chapron's evidence on Thursday.
A few seconds after the incident, Chapron showed Carlos a yellow card, which resulted in the player being sent off as they had also been booked in the first half. Chapron apologised to Carlos.
: Britain's government and regulators will look in detail at the potential risks from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, British junior finance minister John Glen said on Monday.Glen said there had been an "explosion of growth" in crypto assets like bitcoin, which might pose risks even though the underlying technology has immense potential."In our upcoming fintech strategy, the government will announce further work with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England to consider these issues in more detail," Glen told the Innovate Finance conference.Britain's finance ministry will hold its own fintech conference on Thursday.Central bankers in Europe have called for regulation of bitcoin and initial coin offerings, or firms that raise funds by offering cryptocurrencies to investors.But there is no global consensus on action. A meeting of central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of 20 Economies in Argentina on Monday and Tuesday is expected to agree only on more detailed monitoring rather than concrete action.Britain is not expected to rush to impose draconian rules as it wants to remain a key financial technology, or fintech, centre as European countries like France sense an opportunity to lure British firms when Britain leaves the European Union next year."The UK is the best place in the world for fintech and my mandate is to ensure it remains such," said Glen, whose remit covers financial services."I hear rumblings across the Channel that (French) President Macron is looking to drag you all over to Paris," Glen said."It's a great city. Hop over on Eurostar and enjoy the weekend stocking up on croissants, and then come back to London on Monday morning and carry on making money and crack on as you have been."The Treasury Select Committee in Britain's parliament has already launched an investigation into cryptocurrencies, and its chair said regulation needed to keep up with the pace of change as different countries compete fiercely to attract fintech firms."We don't want to be dragged into a race to the bottom. Effective regulation is good for the sector and we can learn from other jurisdictions," Nicky Morgan said.Britain's fintech sector enjoyed a record year in 2017, with 1.3 billion pounds invested with over half the funding from abroad, and there was no desire to shift gears or resort to complacency, Glen said.Innovate Finance and the City of London Corporation, the municipal authority the runs the historic financial district, launched a FinTech Strategy Group on Monday.It will bring together senior officials from the industry, banks and regulators to advise on maintaining the sector's competitiveness.
DURING their maiden visit to Karachi where they also paid tributes to Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi announced development packages both for Karachi and Hyderabad. Karachi would get Rs. 25 billion and Hyderabad Rs. 5 billion for developmental activities and addressing fundamental problems of the residents.
By making formal announcement, the Prime Minister has fulfilled the commitment that was earlier made by Mian Nawaz Sharif and reiterated by them during their meeting with an MQM delegation that met them on the occasion of election for the office of the Prime Minister. Hopefully, the amount, if judiciously spent, would help alleviate sufferings of the people of these two urban centres of Sindh. It has to be kept in mind that the overall development and resolution of problems of these cities was responsibility of the provincial government and if the Sindh government also allocates matching grants for people-oriented programmes and projects for Karachi and Hyderabad the situation would change a lot. Development of these cities is deeply linked to improvement of overall security and law & order problem, as a satisfied population would help maintain peace. As MQM was complaining that it was being pushed to the wall, the meetings of the Prime Minister with its leaders and acceptance of their demands would also go a long way in soothing the overall political environment. The package, if implemented in letter and in spirit, would also help promote better understanding between PML (N) and MQM, which could prove to be crucial in the forthcoming general elections.

AT&T's lead attorney, Daniel Petrocelli, took aim Monday at thousands of pages of emails from AT&T employees that the Justice Department wants to submit as evidence of potential competitive harms of the deal. Petrocelli argued that the government was asserting too broad a view of what is considered a business record. As an example, they cited 18 documents produced by a lower level AT&T employee whom Petrocelli described as "one young man who just came out of business school."
Omission of RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav's name from a list of dignitaries who would be attending the party's 22nd foundation day celebrations here on Thursday, has added gist to speculations about a rift within party chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's family.However, a number of posters were put up at the party's state headquarters here and the venue of the function, featuring all members of the family currently active in politics. The posters also included Tej Pratap's newly-wedded wife Aishwarya Rai, signalling their possible entry into public life.Reacting to omission of their name, the RJD chief's elder son rubbished speculations about rift within the family."What is so big about my name not featuring in a list of RJD leaders on the invitation card. My name and my photographs can be found on all the posters and banners put up by the party. I will also be taking part in the celebrations tomorrow. All this talk of family feud is a rumour spread by BJP people," they told reporters.But, BJP and JD(U) seem to be in no mood to buy their defence and reiterated growing trouble within the RJD's first family.BJP state vice president Devesh Kumar told PTI there was trouble brewing within the Lalu family which controls the party."While we abhor dynasty politics, going by the Hindu tradition, Tej Pratap who is the elder son of the RJD supremo deserved to be the political heir. But that did not happen," they said."He had to remain content with a cabinet berth when their younger brother Tejashwi Yadav became the deputy chief minister. At present, Tej Pratap is just a party MLA while Tejashwi is the leader of the opposition in the state assembly," the BJP leader said."Lalu also played favourites by getting Tejashwi declared as the party's chief ministerial candidate, leaving Tej Pratap with no choice but to play second fiddle," they alleged."So now, while the three children of Lalu, including the eldest daughter Misa Bharti are active in politics, it is Tejashwi who is hogging the limelight. It is foolish to blame BJP for the rift in the family, which is all too obvious," the state BJP vice president added.About Lalu's daughter-in-law Aishwarya's photograph on the posters, the BJP leader said it only proves that in the RJD, you have to be related to the Lalu family, in whatever way, in order to take centre stage. Tej Pratap had tied knot with Aishwarya in May this year.Echoing the BJP leader's views, JD(U) MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Lalu Prasad has emerged as a neo-feudal force in modern politics."Indeed, there is a rift within the family and that is inevitable when the entire family enters politics and starts yearning for clout," they said."As if this was not enough, now the RJD supremo's daughter-in-law of two months also seems to be ready to enter the political arena. Lalu may have worked hard to earn their own political stature, but they have degenerated into a patriarch who cannot look beyond their family," the JD(U) leader alleged.It would be for the first time that Lalu Prasad, who had floated the RJD after breaking away from the Janata Dal in 1997, would remain conspicuous by their absence at Thursday's function which would be inaugurated by Tejashwi Yadav.Convicted in cases of multi-crore fodder scam, Prasad is presently on provisional bail on medical ground.  They are admitted at a Mumbai hospital.According to a statement issued by RJD state unit spokesperson Chitaranjan Gagan, top leaders like national vice presidents Rabri Devi, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Shivanand Tiwary, state president Ram Chandra Purve, MPs, MLAs and office bearers at district and block levels will be attending the function.

WATERFORD >> Jessica Stoddard had some big shoes to fill when they took over as coach of the Novi Detroit Catholic Central boys swim team.
Replacing legendary coach Shannon Dunworth wouldnt be easy, but Stoddard has quickly shown that the program is in good hands. That was emphasized on Saturday when the Shamrocks won their first Oakland County Championship, edging six-time defending champs Brother Rice, 269.5-266.5
Its amazing for us. It has been one of our goals, Stoddard said of the victory. You have to tip your hat to Brother Rice, they are always tremendous competitors. Winning this is a real honor for us. I am so excited for the kids.

Dunworth left coaching both the Shamrocks and the Farmington Hills Mercy girls swim program to move to Texas. Stoddard stepped in this winter at Catholic Central and the Shamrocks have looked as good as ever.
It can be hard being a woman coaching a bunch of guys, but they have all been great, Stoddard said. They do everything I ask of them and give everything they can to the team. Our senior class has been awesome. They have led by example for the rest of the team.
Saturdays meet came down to the very end. Brother Rice claimed the 400 freestyle relay with a time of 3:10.88 and the Shamrocks had to finish second behind the Warriors, which they were able to do with a time of 3:11.58. Conor Brownell, Bennett Loniewski, Matthew Kozma and Jonathan Lee made up the team that secured the title.
We had some guys not have their best swims, but it seemed like every time that happened, someone else picked them up with a better swim than expected, Stoddard said. It was a real team victory and it was good to see us respond the way we did.
The Shamrocks didnt claim an event win on Saturday, but did finish second in all three relays. August Thielking, Lee, Charlie Walsh and Brian Hussey were second in the 200 medley relay (1:37.09) while Brownell, Hussey, Tommy Wiaduck and Loniewski were second in the 200 freestyle relay (1:28.26).
The win for the Shamrocks should give them momentum heading into the final stages of the season.
We still have work to do. We have bigger goals ahead, Stoddard said. I am the most superstitious person ever, so I wont say what the goals are. I will just say they are pretty high. This meet is a stepping stone toward those goals.
Brother Rice still had plenty to celebrate on Saturday. The Warriors won four events, most of any team. Alex Margherio, Jake Farr, Spencer Geyman and Jonah Venos combined to win the 400 freestyle relay (3:10.88) while Timmy Page, Venos, Margherio and Farr won the 200 medley relay (1:34.95). Margherio won the 100 butterfly (50.47) while Venos won the 100 freestyle (46.54).
Rochester Adams finished a close third on the day with 261 points. The Highlanders were led by Soodong Kim, who won diving (405.20) and Graham Miotke, who won the 500 freestyle (4:35.91).
Harrison Farmington finished fourth on the day with 190.5 points. The Phoenix claimed the win in the 200 freestyle relay (1:26.66) with a team of Brody Jamieson, Drew Hinckley, Drew Hoelscher and Trevor Jones.
Troy senior Max Chen led the Colts to a 10th-place finish as they won the 50 freestyle (20.84) and the 100 breaststroke (55.84), which was a new county meet record. They were the lone individual to win two events.
I am really happy with how I swam. I really didnt expect to go that fast, Chen said. My blood just gets pumping for these meets. I just wanted to go for it and give my all. It was nice to come out of the water and see a first place next to my name.
Berkley first-year student Jack Hamilton claimed first in the 200 freestyle (1:42.61) while Walled Lake Northern sophomore Zane Rosely was the winner in the 200 IM (1:53.80) and Northerns Kaden Schwaiger won the 100 backstroke (51.70).

Calhoun May Come Out of Retirement
University of Connecticut's (UConn) former basketball coach Jim Calhoun might be coming out of retirement.
Calhoun is a Hall of Famer who led UConn's mens basketball team to three national championships.
He's been retired since 2012, but according to the Hartford Courant, he's been offered the head coaching job at the University of St. Joseph, a Division III school in West Hartford that does not have a basketball team currently.
Calhoun would be responsible for creating the school's first basketball program. The St. Joseph BlueJays are scheduled to begin playing in the fall of 2018 when the university admits full-time, traditional male undergrad students for the first time.
St. Joseph's was formerly an all-female school.
Calhoun told ESPN they want to clear this job offer with their wife and will make a decision in the next week.
NBC Connecticut reached out to St. Joseph's University for comment.
A spokesperson for the university's president, Rhonda Free, said they are letting the coach's comments stand on their own. However, they said they can't think of a better person to inaugurate a basketball program at the school.
At their annual golf tournament on Monday, Calhoun talked about how much they missed coaching.
"It's not a great day. You go in and you play a game, you win it. It feels like 85 degrees, perfect weather and you get on that cause a group of us got up and worked for the last three or four months to get this and we did it. Together we did it, and that's the part that I really miss," Calhoun said.
The athletic director at St. Joseph, Bill Carderelli, coached with Calhoun in Storrs in 1986.
Calhoun built the UConn basketball program and would have to do it from scratch again at St. Joseph.
It's not a done deal by any stretch but it appears Calhoun is ready for a new challenge.
Animal welfare activists began the new year in Massachusetts rescuing 10 dolphins stranded in Wellfleet Harbor.
International Fund for Animal Welfare spokesperson Kerry Branon told The Boston Globe that the nonprofit group began receiving calls Sunday morning about three dolphins swimming in the harbor.
By the time rescue crews arrived, the number of dolphins was up to 10.
At first, they tried to coax the dolphins into open water using two boats.

When the tide went out, the rescuers had to adopt more aggressive techniques.
They used stretchers to move the animals one by one to transport trucks and released them in nearby Truro where the group hoped favorable winds and tides would help the animals make it out to sea.
Dozens of staff and volunteers participated in the rescue.

BERLIN, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Martin Schulz, the main challenger to Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's Sept. 24 election, accused the country's auto executives on Sunday of putting the industry at risk by failing to plan for the future.
The future of the auto sector, Germany's biggest exporter and provider of some 800,000 jobs, has become a hot election issue as politicians pile blame on executives and each other for the sector's battered reputation after an emissions scandal.
Schulz, leader of the left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD), took aim at what they described as "irresponsible managers" in the sector.
"The problem is, we are living through a situation in Germany in which managers worth millions at VW, at Daimler, have fallen asleep and forgotten the future," they told broadcaster ZDF.
The crisis in the sector blew up when Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests almost two years ago.
VW, along with German manufacturers BMW, Daimler , Audi and Porsche are also being investigated by European regulators for alleged anti-competitive collusion.
Seeking to restore the industry's reputation, politicians - though not Merkel themselves - and car bosses agreed earlier this month to overhaul engine software on 5.3 million diesel cars to cut pollution.
Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, themselves a former member of VW's supervisory board, accused Merkel of neglecting their duties by going on holiday rather than chairing the talks with industry bosses on diesel emissions.
"I don't want to spoil anyone's holiday. But here I would have taken charge personally. It is all far too important," Schroeder, a Social Democrat who Merkel defeated in 2005, told Swiss tabloid newspaper Blick.
On Saturday, Merkel kicked off their re-election campaign with a stinging attack on German auto executives, pressing them to innovate to secure jobs, and win back trust lost by a diesel emissions scandal.
Merkel, whose government has faced pressure for being too close to powerful carmakers, and Schulz are both concerned that the sector is being too slow to embrace electric cars. Neither appears to have profited much from the auto debate so far.
An Emnid opinion poll for Sunday's Bild am Sonntag weekly newspaper showed support for Merkel's conservative bloc at 38 percent, unchanged from a week earlier, with the SPD gaining one point to 24 percent.
The two parties rule in a "grand coalition". Although Merkel's conservatives command a comfortable lead over rivals, a fractured political landscape could make forming a power-sharing alliance with a smaller party difficult after the election.
The Emnid poll put support for the far-left Left party at 10 points, with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) both on 8 points, and the environmentalist Greens on 7 points.
Brent crude oil prices moved above $65 per barrel following the closure of the Forties North Sea pipeline. The development did knock out major supplies from a market that was already tightening following OPEC-led production cuts.
Brent crude futures on Tuesday, the international benchmark for oil prices, sat at $65.07 dollars a barrel at 0211 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at 58.21 dollars a barrel.
Britain's Forties oil pipeline, the nation's largest at a capacity of 450,000 barrels per day (bpd), shut down on Monday after cracks were discovered“The market reaction shows that in a tight market, any supply issue will quickly be reflected in higher prices,” said ANZ bank.
The increase in Brent prices widened its premium to WTI prices. This makes U.S. oil exports more attractive.
Stuttgart:Roger Federer suffered a shock defeat to 39-year-old Tommy Haas at the Stuttgart grass court tournament on Wednesday in the Swiss great's first match after almost three months out of action.
Haas, a former World No 2 but now down at 302, won 2-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-4 for just their fourth victory in 17 meetings against their close friend.
Federer, building up for an assault on an eighth Wimbledon title, hadn't played since March, skipping the entire clay court season.
It was just the second defeat of 2017 for the 35-year-old, who claimed the Australian Open for their 18th major in January.
"It's always special to play a close friend like Roger on grass, always lots of emotion," said Haas, who has undergone nine surgeries in their career to mend a number of ailments.
"I saved a match point in the second set so was able to play more freely after that. I even shocked myself."
With a combined age of 74, it was the oldest match on the tour since 1982 as Haas, on a farewell to the sport in 2017, made their first quarter-final since Rome in 2014.
Federer also held match point in their only other defeat this year to Russia's Evgeny Donskoy in Dubai.
Haas is the oldest player to beat a top five opponent since Jimmy Connors, at 39 years and five months old, defeated Michael Stich in Memphis in 1992.
 They are also the lowest-ranked player to beat Federer since number 407 Bjorn Phau at Washington in 1999.
Federer, who fired 23 aces in the contest, had match point at 8-7 in the second set tie-breaker but hit a backhand long.
The German took their opportunity and converted their fourth set point when Federer double faulted for the first time in the match.
Haas controlled the decider, breaking for 3-1 before going on to take the victory on a second match point.
They will next face compatriot Mischa Zverev who beat qualifier and fellow German Yannick Hanfmann 7-6 (7/1), 6-2 in 83 minutes.
Philipp Kohlschreiber, the runner-up last year, advanced by beating Steve Johnson of the United States 7-6 (7/3), 5-7, 7-6 (10/8) in two hours and 39 minutes.
The 33-year-old Kohlschreiber, who lost to Austria's Dominic Thiem in the 2016 final, has won five of their seven career titles in Germany.

CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. - Gov. Ralph Northam told 10 News Tuesday that they have no plans to visit storm-ravaged areas of Southwest Virginia.
The three tornadoes that hit parts of Craig, Pittsylvania, Amherst and Campbell counties on April 15 caused more than $16 million in damage.
During an event for Carilion in Christiansburg Tuesday, 10 News asked Northam about their plans to tour the storm damage.
"I haven't yet, but we did declare a state of emergency so that we can make progress and help those individuals, so if there's a need for me to go view one of these areas, I'll be glad to, but I've spent a lot of time in the southwest. Just a couple weeks ago, I was in Lynchburg, so we're in communication and I know exactly what's going on," Northam said.
Northam has plans to visit the area again on Friday to throw out the first pitch at the Salem Red Sox game.

GREENSBORO, NC — The News & Record published an opinion piece yesterday it identified as having been written by Kevin Hazel and John Sorjonen. The authors, who are local employees of Proctor & Gamble, appear to have plagiarized the piece almost entirely. A cursory search, apparently beyond the interest of the N&R editorial page editor, reveals that what the News & Record published is corporate propaganda previously published elsewhere—nearly identical, but for a few words—under the names of other Proctor & Gamble employees.
Here is the piece Hazel and Sorjornen pass off as their own. Highlighted portions are found in columns previously published elsewhere under the names of other authors (linked below).
Congress is in the midst of moving a tax bill that is essential to the United States' economic future. Allow us an opportunity to introduce some facts on why it is so important to our company, our workers and our community.
Procter & Gamble sells consumer products in more than 180 countries and territories. We have 25 manufacturing sites located in 19 U.S. states and territories, as well as nearly 90 manufacturing sites in foreign countries, where we manufacture products close to the consumers we serve worldwide.
Here in Greensboro, we proudly employ nearly 1,200 people between two manufacturing facilities. Within North Carolina, P&G purchases about $995 million of products and services from more than 495 suppliers.
At P&G, we believe tax reform is crucial for both our company and our country. Why? The U.S. tax system puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. P&G has been a global company for more than 100 of our 180 years. In fact, one in five of P&G's U.S.-based jobs support our international business, in areas such as manufacturing, marketing, innovation and supply chain management.
So, when P&G succeeds in international markets, it means we succeed here at home, too.
However, the U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the developed world at 35 percent. The current global average for developed countries is about 24 percent, and countries are lowering their rates further, creating a downward trend. This makes it harder for P&G and other U.S.-headquartered businesses — small and large — to compete with peer companies headquartered overseas. It also reduces the competitiveness of the U.S. economy as a place to do business and create jobs. The Congress is currently considering legislation that would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.
Congress is also considering legislation that would move the U.S. tax code from a worldwide corporate income tax system to what is known as a territorial tax system. This would help American companies, including P&G, compete on a level playing field. Unlike P&G, our competitors headquartered outside the United States — who already operate under a territorial system — do not pay additional tax to their home countries when they sell products outside their home countries. Because 60 percent of P&G's sales are global, the current U.S. tax code puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Other American companies are in a similar position.
As members of Congress debate whether or not to pass tax reform in the coming weeks, it is important to remember that economic growth and jobs in our community depend on having a competitive U.S. tax system. The details will matter, but a tax system with a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a modern territorial tax system will boost economic growth here at home and level the playing field for U.S. businesses and workers — including P&G's U.S. employees here in Greensboro.
The first time Huong Tran pitched a group of Vietnamese investors on Epomi, a beauty retail startup they founded in 2014, they were shocked by their reaction.
“They told me that women are too emotional to run a business and they don't like investing in them,” they said. “This was one of the leading international VC firms in Vietnam—I didn't expect this.”
Until that point, Tran rarely had trouble convincing others to take them seriously. A Vietnamese national with an MBA from Duke and a decade of leadership experience at top multinationals like Samsung and GSK, they had a long track in business. At the time of their pitch, Epomi already had rapid sales growth, an adoring customer base, favorable contracts with top suppliers, and a clear plan to lead Vietnam's fast-growing beauty retail market.
Tran eventually found investment for their startup, but their initial experience is not uncommon. In both developed and emerging economies, gender discrimination is a universal challenge. So is sexual harassment—a problem that's becoming increasingly visible in light of the seemingly endless string of harassment scandals happening in the tech world.
Compared to other Asian countries, however, Vietnam performs relatively well on some measures of gender equality. For example, women hold 17.6% of board seats in Vietnam, more than any other country in the Asia-Pacific region except Australia (20.1%), according to a recent study by Deloitte. The study, which looked at 64 countries globally, also found that Vietnam outperformed the global average (15%), as well as more developed neighbors like Singapore (9.4%) and China (9.2%).
Women also run a substantial share of Vietnam's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Roughly 25% of SMEs in Vietnam are owned by women, according to a 2016 report by the Mekong Business Initiative (MBI), a development partnership co-led by the Asian Development Bank and the Australian government. In South Asia, by contrast, only 8% of SMEs are women-owned.
Women lead some of Vietnam's largest and most iconic companies as well. One of the most prominent is Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, who is best known as founder and CEO of Vietjet, a popular budget airline that listed on the Vietnamese stock exchange earlier this year, and which helped make their Southeast Asia's only female billionaire.
High-profile female executives can also be found in a diverse array of other industries, from retail to agriculture, as well as on the startup circuit.
In some industries, women hold a large share of senior management positions too. Between 2014 and 2016, I worked with a Singapore-based healthcare data company to launch a new service line in Vietnam. During that project, I made sales calls to nearly every multinational pharmaceutical company in the country. While many of those offices are still headed by foreign men, the majority of my business contacts were women. Behind the scenes, women often ran the show.
But not every industry had the same sensibility. Back in 2015, in a series of stories for Techonomy about Vietnam's burgeoning IT sector, throughout dozens of interviews and site visits with local IT services firms, I came across almost no women. As in most countries, women are underrepresented in Vietnam's tech industry, though some educational organizations are keeping this in mind as they work to build the country's STEM talent.
“Vietnam has some prominent female business leaders, but that doesn't mean there's gender equality across the economy,” says Shuyin Tang, a Principal in the Vietnam office of Patamar Capital (formerly Unitus Impact), an impact investment fund with offices in San Francisco and across Asia. To help bridge the gap, Patamar Capital recently launched an investment fund specifically for women-owned businesses in Southeast Asia.
Other organizations are also working to support Vietnamese business persons. For example, MBI recently helped launch the Women's Initiative for Startups and Entrepreneurship, a multi-stakeholder program that will provide programming and services to support women-owned businesses in Vietnam, which a vision to expand to the Mekong region. Another one is Women of Vietnam, a private community launched by a Vietnamese-Australian entrepreneur in 2015.
Organizations like these are tackling a thorny and sometimes contentious topic. “Anyone who brings up gender in the workplace is wading into deep and muddy waters,” wrote Sheryl Sandberg in Lean In, their bestselling book on gender and work in the modern era. “The subject itself presents a paradox: forcing us to acknowledge differences while trying to achieve the goal of being treated the same.”
Yet around the world, there's a growing movement to encourage gender equality and prevent discrimination against women in business. As this movement heats up in Vietnam, expect to see more women entrepreneurs taking charge in this fast-growing and dynamic country.

I understand hindsight is 20/20, but that was a shocking moment to me. And that was not from the hack; that was from interviews I did. And the story about how Marvel got into movies basically because of their anger over how successful Sony was with "Spider-Man," which was their character. Sony was making money off their character and Sony was getting credit for their character and they wanted to get into movies in response to that. They were doing it not because they cared about movies but [because] Marvel saw movies as a way to sell toys. Even to the extent that they picked "Iron Man" because they did focus groups with kids and kids liked "Iron Man" best of all the characters.

: Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi demanded on Friday that petrol and diesel be brought under the Goods and Services Tax regime to prevent "excessive profiteering".He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not view the new tax reform to further electoral interests. "Time to correct the 'One Nation, Seven Tax', multiple form filing and draconian power of taxman. Make it 'Good' and 'Simple' beyond rhetoric," Gandhi said on Twitter.In a series of tweets, they said, "Wish Modiji viewed economic slide and GST mess from prism of solving suffering of people than furthering electoral interests."The Congress leader said, "Then, 1st step would be to bring Petrol/Diesel under GST to prevent excessive profiteering from common man as GOI alone earns Rs 2,73,000 crore."His statement came on a day when the GST Council met to give relief to small and medium enterprises and exporters. In a video message on the Congress Twitter handle, Gandhi asked the government to support small and medium businesses and the informal sector to create jobs and "not unleash taxmen on them".He asked the prime minister to focus on job creation. Gandhi said around 30,000 youth are demanding jobs and only 450 get them everyday, thereby creating an army of 10- lakh unemployed youth a month.He warned that the youth, farmers and small business people are getting angry at the government and this is not good for the country."This will be dangerous for the country," they said. Gandhi accused the government of "attacking" these small and medium businesses first through demonetisation and then through the GST."Instead of helping them, the government is attacking them... These are brutal attacks on these sectors which will wipe them out. Without respecting these sectors you cannot get jobs... For employment generation, small and informal sectors need to be helped," they said.The Congress leader alleged that the government was spending all its energies on big businesses but neglecting the small and medium sectors.On Twitter, they said the textiles sector is the second biggest job generator that yearns for correcting the "distorted" GST structure."Traders, MSMEs, small businesses suffer and cronies profit," Gandhi said.
A car ploughed into the outdoor terrace of a pizzeria in the small town of Sept-Sorts east of Paris on Monday, killing a 12-year-old girl and seriously injuring several other people.The driver deliberately targeted the diners, said a local prosecutor who announced they were ruling out terrorism and opening a murder investigation."There is no doubt that they voluntarily decided to create what happened," prosecutor Eric de Valroger told reporters at the scene of the incident.No weapon was found in the vehicle, the prosecutor added.Interior Ministry spokesperson Pierre-Henry Brandet told Reuters the driver was a "depressive" aged 32 and described them as an unstable character.The incident occurred on a warm summer's evening on the eve of a national holiday and witnesses said the outdoor eating area was busy.A photograph published on social media showed a grey BMW car surrounded by upturned tables in the outdoor seating area of a restaurant. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the image.Brandet said five victims were being treated in hospital for life-threatening injuries. Eight others suffered minor injuries and seven were treated for shock."Everyone on the terrace was hit," one witness told BFM TV.A police source said the driver lived in a neighbouring village to Sept-Sorts, about 41 km (25.6 miles) to the east of Paris, and had tried to commit suicide on Sunday.The incident occurred less than a week after an Algerian national was arrested on suspicion of deliberately ramming a hire car into a group of soldiers on a patrol in the Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret, injuring six of them.The soldiers were part of Operation Sentinel, launched in the wake of Islamist attacks in Paris in early 2015. The Levallois-Perret attack was the 15th on troops and police in the last two-and-a-half years, many of them Islamic State-inspired.

The new Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge in Big Sur is set to open Oct. 13, about eight months after heavy winter storms created a buckle in the road over a 320-foot drop, Caltrans said.
The bridge is a vital link in California's coastal Highway 1 drive. When it was closed in February, it cut off a northern connection to the Big Sur community, whose economy depends heavily on tourism.
Additional storms pounded the Central Coast and created mudslides south of the community in the months that followed, further isolating the town.
Caltrans said replacing the bridge cost $24 million. Repairs of winter storm damage to Californian's roads, bridge and water infrastructure will likely cost upward of $1 billion.
The new bridge, rising 320 feet above Pfeiffer Canyon, uses steel girders rather than the columns that were used originally and became compromised during the storms, Caltrans said. An exact time for the bridge's official opening next week has not been announced.

The government has made biometric identification Aadhaar mandatory for all post office deposits, PPF, the National Savings Certificate scheme and Kisan Vikas Patra.Existing depositors have been given time till December 31, 2017 to provide the 12-digit unique identification number.Ministry of Finance has issued four separate Gazette notifications making Aadhaar mandatory for opening all post office deposit accounts, Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Savings Certificate scheme and Kisan Vikas Patra deposits."Provided that where Aadhaar number has not been assigned, the depositor shall submit proof of application of enrollment for Aadhaar," the notification dated September 29 said.Existing depositors who have not provided Aadhaar number at the time of application for such deposit "shall submit their Aadhaar number to the post office savings bank or deposit office concerned, on or before December 31, 2017," it added.The government has insisted on quoting Aadhaar for bank deposits, obtaining mobile phone and several other utilities to weed out benami deals and black money.Last month, it extended the deadline for obtaining Aadhaar for availing government schemes and subsidies by three months to December 31. Earlier, those who did not have Aadhaar were asked to procure it by September 30.As many as 135 schemes (of 35 ministries) including the free cooking gas (LPG) to poor women, kerosene and fertilizer subsidy, targeted public distribution system (PDS) and MGNREGA will be covered by the extension."As a result of the review of welfare schemes covered and to provide the benefits of such schemes to all eligible beneficiaries of the scheme, it has been decided to further extend the stipulated date in all such notifications up to December 31, 2017," an order dated September 26 said.The extension would also apply for Employees' Pension Scheme of 1995, scholarships, housing subsidy benefit, stipend to SC/ST trainees for coaching guidance and vocational training, stipend to handicapped and Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana.Besides, it would be applicable for national apprenticeship and skill development schemes, crop insurance schemes, interest subvention scheme, scholarship and fellowship schemes, various education programmes such as mid-day meal for children and Atal Pension Yojana."It is hereby clarified that this extension shall only apply to those beneficiaries who are not assigned Aadhaar number or those who have not yet enrolled for Aadhaar.

A young auctioneer from north Powys has been shortlisted for a national agricultural award, pitting them up against some of the UK's other up and coming auctioneers.
Tom Davies, a chartered surveyor at Morris, Marshall and Poole based in Welshpool and an auctioneer at Welshpool Livestock Sales (WLS), has been short-listed for the prestigious Farmers Guardian Marts' the Heart Awards 2017.
Tom, who comes from Welshpool, has been named along with four other new auctioneers from throughout the UK.
All five will be selected through a combination of public votes, the strength of their nomination and personal summary and the opinion of a panel of judges.
The Mart's the Heart Awards champions what makes livestock markets great and highlight the work of those within the industry in the UK.
Mr Davies said: “I'm really pleased to have been short-listed for the award and to be one of just five from throughout the UK to have been selected. British and Welsh agriculture is very important to me and developing the sector locally and within the mart has been a major part of my work at MMP and WLS.
“The past 12 months has been really busy. I also successfully passed my entry into the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and qualified as an RICS registered valuer. I'm part of the rural and agricultural team at MMP, working closely with farmers, landowners and agricultural businesses which means day-to-day involvement in the community I live and work in.
“So, when it comes to auctioneering livestock at WLS I have a deep understanding of the people involved, the flocks and livestock and wider industry involved.”
Tom attended Harper Adams University before joining MMP and WLS and its store sheep section.
Morris, Marshall and Poole is a partner in WLS, based at Buttington Cross.
Keith Davies, a partner at MMP, said: “We're really pleased for Tom who has achieved a great deal since joining us and has a passion for the development of the agricultural sector in the area.
“Being short-listed for the Marts the Heart Award is testament to their hard work and determination and we hope that their career continues to develop to serve the rural community of Mid Wales and the Borders”
Tom is also chairperson of the Welshpool fundraising committee for next year's featured county of Montgomeryshire at the Royal Welsh Show.

Netflix has a revolving door of movies and shows: as soon as something new comes in, something old must go out to make room for it. While it can be tough to say goodbye to certain programs you love, at least you can take solace in all the exciting premieres the new month will bring. And this list of 15 kids' TV shows and movies coming to Netflix in May proves that there's plenty to look forward to in the coming weeks.
Though there are quite a few originals making their way to Netflix in May, there will also be some older shows and movies debuting on the streaming service. In addition to the joy of discovering something new, subscribers can indulge in a little comforting nostalgia too. Adults might enjoy documentaries like Jewel's Catch One or End Game, both of which will be new additions after April's over, or they could be looking forward to the return of beloved sitcom Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. But Netflix is all about varity; the streaming service makes sure there's something for the entire family to enjoy together, so no one is left out when you settle down to stream.
Without further ado, here are all the kids' movies and TV shows making the jump to Netflix in May 2018:
'Shrek' (May 1) Giphy On the very first day of the month, enjoy the movie that spawned countless merchandise long before the Minions.
'High School Musical 3: Senior Year' (May 1) Giphy If Shrek isn't your speed but you're still craving some musical stylings, then perhaps you can start May off with the last High School Musical.
'Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures': Season 1 (May 1) Giphy You can also get to know Barbie and their friends a little bit better in the first season of Barbie Dreamhouse Adventures.
'Pocoyo & Cars' (May 1) Giphy Younger kids might enjoy the vibrant and colorful Pocoyo & Cars, which clocks in at under twenty minutes. If you only need a brief burst of entertainment, it's the one for you.
'Pocoyo & The Space Circus' (May 1) Giphy But if Pocoyo & Cars is a success with your little ones, you can extend the fun further with Pocoyo & The Space Circus.
'Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V': Season 1 (May 1) Giphy The first of May is a busy one of Netflix, with tons of properties making their debut — including Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V. It should give you plenty to pick from.
'A Little Help With Carol Burnett' (May 4) Netflix This Netflix original features comedy queen Carol Burnett handing out unscripted advice to celebrities and audience members alike with the assistance of some helpful kids.
'Kong: King Of The Apes': Season 2 (May 4) Netflix If you were eager to see the continuation of Kong: King of the Apes, then you don't have much longer to wait before the story picks up again.
'Spirit Riding Free': Season 5 (May 11) Netflix Originally inspired by the film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, the Netflix series charges ahead with yet another season this month.
'The Who Was? Show' (May 11) Netflix Based on a series of bestselling Penguin books, The Who Was? Show sketch comedy show is both humorous and informative. It gives kids a primer on historical figures using live action skits, animated shorts, improv, and music.
'Mamma Mia!' (May 16) Giphy Though some of its themes might be on the mature side, the musical fun of Mamma Mia! makes it a great family experience. Catch up ahead of its sequel's theatrical release on July 20.
'Inspector Gadget': Season 4 (May 18) Giphy Netflix's reboot of Inspector Gadget delivers a classic cartoon to a brand-new audience, and it will be returning shortly.
'Bridge To Terabithia' (May 19) Giphy After having your childhood crushed by the heartbreak that is Bridge to Terabithia, why not watch the entire tragic saga play out in live action and full color? It's always nice to see a beloved book adapted, even if the book in question is seriously sob-inducing.
'Trollhunters': Part 3 (May 25) Netflix The thrilling adventures in Trollhunter conclude on May 25, and it seems like it will be an intense finale. According to Netflix, the "fate of both trolls and humans hangs in the balance" while everyone waits to see if Gunmar will succeed in their tasks.
NOWSHERA - A 17-year-old transgender was shot dead on Monday in Khweshgi area of Nowshera district over a petty issue, police said.
The police claimed to have arrested the killers identified as Amir and their accomplice Abid, who would be produced before the court.
The police, while quoting the alleged killers, said that the transgender identified as Adnan alias Sufaid, a resident of Mardan, had friendship with Amir.
They said that the deceased stopped meeting Amir after differences over some petty issues. Amir forced them to meet them but to no avail. Enraged by transgender's refusal, Amir along with Abid took the extreme step and shot them dead.
Body of the deceased was handed over to their relative for burial while cases were registered against the arrested persons.
The teenager who fatally shot 17 people in a Florida high school giggled and proudly proclaimed they would become "the next school shooter," according to cell phone videos they made of themselves just before the attack.
asset not included because it is a duplicate of primary asset
“My name is Nik, and I'm going to be the next school shooter of 2018,” Nikolas Cruz said on the videos, released by prosecutors Wednesday. “My goal is at least 20 people.”
At least one of the videos appears to have been made on the same day as the Valentine's Day assault on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Cruz, 19, says they want to become a school shooter for the notoriety it would bring him.
“When you see me on the news you'll know who I am,” Cruz says with a smile. “You're all going to die. Pew pew pew. Yeah, can't wait.”
In one of the videos, Cruz outlined their plan for the massacre, saying that they intended to take Uber to the school and eventually end up on an upper floor of the building so that they could fire down on fleeing students like a sniper.
Cruz did take an Uber ride to the school that day, but for reasons that remain unclear, they aborted the last part of their plan and did not fire from an upper floor. After shooting 34 people, they fled with other people, mixing in with the crowd before getting a drink at a nearby restaurant.
Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was one of the victims, said they read a transcript of the videos but chose not to watch them, the Orlando Sentinel reported.
“I already know what they did,” Guttenberg told the newspaper. “He's evil. Repulsive. They deserve to be dead . . . They talked about how they were going to be someone now. It's a level of thought that I can't comprehend. It looks, from the words, like the kid had joy. I don't want to see the delight they took in planning the murders of our children.”
Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was among the dead, said Cruz can now rule out an insanity plea, the Sentinel reported.
“It just shows this kid was competent. This whole thing was premeditated murder,” they said. “This kid knew exactly what they were doing.”
Cruz suggested that they were planning the attacks in retaliation for being treated badly, although it is unclear by whom.
“I've had enough being told what to do and when to do . . . Telling me I'm an idiot," they said. “In real life, you're all stupid and brainwashed.”
Several Parkland students criticized the release of the video and implored others not to share it on social media.
That video is disgusting and is about to make me throw up. Their face haunts me every single day and now I can't get their demonic laugh out of my head. So can people please not spread that video around. It is only giving them what they want. — Morgan Williams #NEVERAGAIN (@morganw_44) May 30, 2018
Please do not share the recent video that the media released of the perpetrator talking about their plan of 2/14. Please. They do not deserve the spotlight they want. It upsets not only me but everyone personally affected by this event. — natasha #NeverAgain (@sighnatasha) May 30, 2018

DISGRACED TV star Roseanne Barr has gone into meltdown a day after their sitcom was axed over their racist tweets with another barrage of strange posts.
Despite repeatedly saying they were sorry and telling fans not to defend her, they continued to retweet their supportive messages, prompting some to doubt the sincerity of their apology.
"It was sincere, but there's just a limit of bullying I'm going to remain silent for. go away," they tweeted the day after the cancellation, telling another critic, "I've been punished enough and have my own story to tell."
Even Donald Trump weighed in on the drama after the actor's rebooted hit TV show was abruptly axed by the ABC, asking why the US network had apologised to Jarrett but not to them for "HORRIBLE statements" made about them on the network.
Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let them know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, they never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 30 May 2018
Barr earlier said they "felt bad" for the US President because "he goes thru this every single day."
Roseanne was cancelled after its star compared black former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett to an ape, writing that if Islamist political movement "Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby = vj."
Responding to a photo someone shared of them dressed as Hitler on Wednesday, the disgraced actor wrote, "I'm a Jew, bigot."
In a series of tweets unleashed hours after they were fired, Barr said they did something "unforgivable", "egregious" and "
indefensible" and admitted they "went too far".
They said their original comments were a result of "Ambien tweeting" - a reference to the sleeping pill.
cuz i've been punished enough and have my own story to tell — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) 30 May 2018
When they were called out for making excuses, they answered: "No, i didnt i blamed myself. stop lying. Yes, I have had odd ambien experiences on tweeting late at night-like many other ppl do. I BLAME MYSELF OK? it's just an explanation not an excuse, Ok, bully?"
Ambien maker Sanofi released a blunt statement on Wednesday morning, saying "racism is not a known side effect" of its medication.
Barr told one supporter: "I gave them the weapon to kill me - I was not equipped to take all the heat. I cracked & made a stupid insensitive joke - it's my fault."
They even retweeted a Charlie Sheen post that read "adios Roseanne!" and said the runway was now clear for a reboot of their sitcom, Two And A Half Men.
adios
Roseanne!
good
riddance.

They were among many celebrities, including Bryan Cranston, Minnie Driver and Jim Parsons, to join the criticism of Barr's offensive comments.
Barr initially clumsily apologised, saying they were "not racist, just an idiot who made a bad joke" and planned to leave Twitter.
But they then backtracked and became more vocal than ever, taking shots at two cast members who called them out for their "abhorrent" rant.
Sara Gilbert, who plays their on-screen daughter, tweeted: "Roseanne's recent comments ... and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in their actions to say the least."
Barr replied simply: "Wow! unreal."
They later told a fan: "I understand their position and why they said what they said. i forgive them It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up."

They also took aim at Michael Fishman, who has played their on-screen son since the show's start in 1988.
Fishman wrote: "Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience who welcomed us into their homes.
"Our cast, crew, writers, and production staff strives for inclusiveness, with numerous storylines designed to reflect inclusiveness."
Barr took exception to that. "I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. Nice!" they tweeted.
The comedian declared they aren't a racist, and tweeted at Jarrett directly to apologise for "hurting and upsetting u with an insensitive & tasteless tweet".
"I am truly sorry - my whole life has been about fighting racism," their tweet to Jarrett continued. "I made a terrible mistake which caused hundreds of ppl 2 lose their jobs. so sorry!"
While apologising repeatedly, Barr's choice of retweets from supporters justifying their original, racist message struck a defiant tone - they included a post that juxtaposed an image of Jarrett with an image of a Planet of the Apes actor and another that said they didn't know the Obama staffer was black.
They appeared to justify that move by tweeting that, while they were sorry for the joke that started it all, they would continue to defend herself.
They also suggested that US network ABC axed the show because of a "threatened boycott" from the show's advertisers by "ppl who do that sort of thing".
Critics leapt upon that declaration with swift replies, including: "I heard it was because your actions had consequences. Put your big girl pants on and take responsibility."
"I heard it was because you can't keep your racist typing hands off of social media," another added.
thanks for supporting me! I gave them the weapon to kill me-I was not equipped to take all the heat. I cracked & made a stupid insensitive joke-it's my fault. — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) 30 May 2018
This statement was originally published on africafex.org on 14 November 2017.
The government of Cameroon has within the last one year shut down the Internet in its attempt to clampdown on demonstrations by aggrieved citizens of the two English-speaking regions of the country.
Leaders of the North-west and South-west regions of Cameroon have accused the central government of discrimination against their people from the only two Anglophone regions out of the Central African country's ten administrative regions. Protests against the reported acts of marginalisation, which the government continues to deny, intensified in November 2016, when the Paul Biya government made an attempt to impose the use of French language in schools and courts in the two English speaking regions.
In its bid to restore calm to the restive Anglophone regions, the government ended up violating the fundamental human rights of its citizenry including their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.
The national telecommunications and internet service provider, Cameroon Telecommunications (CAMTEL), on January 17, 2017 ordered Internet Service Providers in North-west and South-west regions to completely shut down the Internet in the two regions. What started as the government's expression of dissatisfaction about the ongoing protests turned out to be Africa's longest Internet shutdown having lasted 94 days. The three-month Internet shutdown had serious ramifications for political, economic and human development in the country.
The government again shut down the Internet on October 1, 2017 barely six months later, while the country is still struggling to recover from the economic loss from the previous shutdown estimated at U.S. $4.5 million.
Today, November 14, 2017 marks 45 days since the Cameroonian government deprived citizens of the restive English-speaking regions of Internet access – a blatant violation of their right to freedom of expression and access to information.
The African Freedom of Expression Exchange (AFEX) once again joins the international community to denounce the use of internet shutdowns as a mechanism to stifle free speech on the continent. Network shutdowns have proven futile during protests; in many instances, the cyber repression has rather helped fuel further anger and agitation among aggrieved citizens.
We call on President Paul Biya's government to demonstrate its commitment to safeguard freedom of expression and access to information rights as enshrined in regional and international frameworks to which Cameroon is signatory.
AFEX urges President Biya to restore internet connection in the North-west and South-west Regions of Cameroon and ensure the protection of the lives of citizens in the dissenting regions.
We further call on the African Union (AU) and the United Nations Organisation (UNO) to intervene to ensure that the government of Cameroon and governments across the region put an end to the use of partial or complete network shutdowns to repress free speech during important national events under the guise of 'protecting national security'.
Background
In November 2016, the Cameroonian government decided to impose the use of French language in public institutions in the two Anglophone regions sparking a wave of protests. Several citizens have been arrested, detained, disappeared or even killed while the Internet has been shut down on two occasions. Calls from local, regional and international human rights organisations urging the Cameroonian government and the leadership of the two English-speaking regions to resort to resolving their differences have gone unheeded.

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday recalled its order taking on record an affidavit of the NDA government saying Jamia Millia Islamia was not a minority institution, and striking off the response of the erstwhile UPA government supporting its minority status. The high court recalled its 13 March order saying it had "erroneously" not noted that there were other parties in the matter who could have been affected by the proceedings.
It allowed the plea of the university vice-chancellor, its registrar and the teachers' association that the present government has not established any ground for replacement of the existing affidavit of 29 August, 2011. They said that neither were they served a copy of the Centre's recent application to take on record the fresh affidavit, nor were they heard before the disposal of the plea.
A bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said there was merit in the submission and added: "we have erroneously not noted that there were other respondents, who could have been affected by the outcome of the proceedings". The court said it was trite that all the affected parties were required to be heard before passing an order and recalled its 13 March order.
On 13 March, the court had accepted the prayer made by the Centre's counsel and permitted them to file a fresh counter affidavit which was submitted on 5 March. It had also said that the 2011 affidavit supporting the minority status, shall stand struck off from the record. Reversing the previous government's stand, the Centre had filed the revised affidavit in the high court opposing the order of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) declaring Jamia Millia as a religious minority institution.
The HRD ministry, under then minister Kapil Sibal of the UPA-II government, had on 29 August, 2011, submitted an affidavit in the court stating that the government respects the declaration made by NCMEI. The fresh affidavit, filed by the BJP-led government last month, cited the Supreme Court's decision in the Azeez Basha Vs Union of India case of 1968 to justify the change in stand. It stated that the first affidavit did not take note of the Azeez Basha case, in which the apex court had said that a university incorporated under an Act of Parliament cannot claim the status of a minority institution.
“In any event, in the present case, the Board of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) is elected and need not necessarily consist of majority belonging to Muslim religion. The question of it being a minority institution therefore does not arise,” the affidavit, filed by deputy secretary of Department of Higher Education under the HRD ministry, had said.
“Treating a central university as a minority education institution is repugnant to law besides undermining its status and is against the basic tenet of a central university. "By no stretch of imagination, Article 30(1) could be read to mean that even if an educational institution has been established by a Central Act, still the minority has the right to administer it,” the affidavit had said.
It had said that the earlier stand of the government that it respected the NCMEI's decision that JMI was a minority institution may be treated as withdrawn, considering its repugnancy vis-a-vis the facts and Supreme Court ruling in Azeez Basha's case and "treating it as an incorrect understanding of the government about the legal position that JMI is a minority institution".
The latest affidavit had concluded that JMI “is not a 'minority institution' having been set up by an Act of Parliament and funded by central government and also that it was not set up by a minority sect”.
The high court had in March 2011 sought the Centre's response on a petition seeking quashing of the order of the NCMEI conferring minority status to JMI. Petitioner Vijay Kumar Sharma had argued that the commission's order was "contrary to law and violative of provisions of the Jamia Milia Islamia Act".
The 22 February, 2011 order of NCMEI empowered the university to do away with all existing quota policies for the SC/ST and OBC candidates and reserve 50 per cent of the seats for Muslim students in all its programmes.
The petition had said,"the Commission order will mean, a large number of students belonging to non-Muslim community will be deprived of their right to seek admission in the university. Such a reservation cannot be allowed in a central university managed and funded by the state."

Nashville Waffle House shooting: Bond revoked for suspect
A judge has revoked the $2 million bond that had been set for Waffle House shooting suspect Travis Reinking, prosecutors confirm to CBS affiliate WTVF. The move came after community outcry over the bond set Monday for the suspect, who is accused of killing four people and wounding four others in a shooting rampage at the Nashville-area restaurant early Sunday.
Reinking, 29, was taken into custody Monday after a citizen tip, ending a 24-hour manhunt involving more than 160 law enforcement officers. They were arrested in a wooded area not far from their apartment complex and the crime scene. Reinking was formally charged late Monday with four counts of criminal homicide and was ordered held on the $2 million bond, court records show.
Additional charges may also be considered, WTVF reports.
A motive remains unclear, but questions remain about official responses to months of Reinking's bizarre behavior before the restaurant attack, including encounters with police in Illinois and Colorado and an arrest at the White House that raised red flags.
Police said about 20 customers were in the restaurant when Reinking opened fire. The first victims were Taurean Sanderlin, 29, of Goodlettsville, and Joe Perez, 20, of Nashville, who were shot down in the parking lot. Then DeEbony Groves, 21, a student at Nashville's Belmont University, and Akilah Dasilva, 23, a rap artist and music video producer, were killed inside the restaurant before customer James Shaw Jr. grabbed the hot muzzle of the assault weapon and wrestled it away.
Shaw, 29, a Nashville native who works as a wireless technician for AT&T, has been hailed as a hero.

Marvel fans were delighted at the end of last week when Marvel Studios decided to pull down the veil of secrecy and release a behind-the-scenes video for Avengers: Infinity War. Fans got to see Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) hanging out together, which was pretty cool. But perhaps more cool was the look at Thanos that was provided in the video. Now, in another welcomed reveal, Avengers: Infinity War co-writer Stephen McFeely has explained Thanos' grand plan.
Just in case you were worried, Stephen McFeely doesn't really give any spoilers, but just merely gives an idea of what Thanos is ultimately trying to accomplish in vague terms. The reveal comes courtesy of the Doctor Strange Blu-ray/DVD release, as reported by Screen Rant. Here is what McFeely had to say about Thanos' plan in Avengers 3.
"His goal is to re-balance the universe as they see it. So when they figure out that the Infinity Stones could do this for them at the snap of a finger, that becomes their main goal."
What is perhaps most interesting about Stephen McFeely's statement is that they very noticeably avoids using the word death. Fans of Marvel Comics who have read the Infinity Gauntlet arc will know why that matters. For those who may not know, in the comics, Mistress Death is a female character and is the personification of the abstract idea that is mortality. Thanos is obsessed with them and in order to impress her, wipes out half of the Marvel Universe after assembling all of the Infinity Gems. It isn't clear if that will be Thanos' method of balancing the universe in Avengers: Infinity War or what it is that has the universe unbalanced in their mind, but it seems like they are planning on cleaning house in a big way.
Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers 4 are currently shooting in Atlanta and will be shooting back to back in a massive production that is expected to last most of 2017. Mistress Death has not been confirmed for the movies, but it is possible that they are going to appear and that Marvel is holding off on revealing them until closer to the release of the movie. If Death isn't in the movie, it will be interesting to see what it is that is motivating Thanos to "re-balance" the universe.
Joe Russo and Anthony Russo, who directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, are directing the next two Avengers installments for Marvel. The cast for Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers 4 includes Josh Brolin, Chris Hemsworth, Sebastian Stan, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Chris Evans, Elizabeth Olsen, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Rudd, Paul Bettany, Chadwick Boseman, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Karen Gillan, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Benedict Wong, Brie Larson and Robert Downey Jr.Avengers: Infinity War is scheduled to hit theaters on May 4, 2018, with Avengers 4 set to come out a year later on May 3, 2019.

Premier Stephen McNeil says their Liberal caucus supports their decision to end work-to-rule and impose a contract on teachers.
On Tuesday, Education Minister Karen Casey introduced Bill 75 in the legislature. It will impose a contract on teachers and force an end to the work-to-rule campaign that teachers have been waging since December.
It's a controversial move, sparking condemnation from the Nova Scotia Teachers Union, the official opposition Progressive Conservatives and the NDP. While Casey introduced the bill, teachers and supporters were outside the legislature protesting the bill.

Despite the pushback, McNeil said their caucus is onside.
“We have caucus support to end work-to-rule and this piece of legislation will let that happen,” they told reporters Tuesday evening.
The opposition can use tactics to delay the passage of the bill but with a Liberal majority in the house, the contract will ultimately be proclaimed unless some Liberal MLAs vote against the bill.
Liberals walking into the house on Tuesday evening did not respond when asked where they stood on the bill.
Earlier in the day, Liberal MLA David Wilton said “no comment” when asked whether they will support legislating the contract.
Asked whether McNeil will allow a free vote on the contract or enforce the party line, the premier said, “I fully expect all members of the house to want to end work-to-rule and I expect them to vote that and I assume the opposition will do as well.”
Pressed further on whether it would be a free vote, McNeil said “every vote's that way.”
MLAs to sit overnight to debate teachers contract
After a brief sitting on Tuesday evening when the bill was introduced in the legislature, MLAs will return to Province House at midnight to start second reading debate.
Routine proceedings and question period will take roughly two hours. After that, the opposition will have two hours to debate a bill that they choose. Debate on Bill 75 is expected to start at 4 a.m.
The public can watch proceedings at the legislature or tune in online.

22nd annual SugarFest introduces juke joint exhibit

Musicians, artists and reenactors gathered with thousands of guests for the 22nd annual SugarFest, a sweet celebration of the sugarcane harvest, on Sunday, Oct. 1. This year performers took their music to the juke joint stage for the first time.
The juke joint stage is a new addition to the West Baton Rouge Museum that will be used for hosting concerts and will part of the museum's permanent blues exhibit. The exhibit pays homage to local blues venues of the past on the West Side and in the Baton Rouge area.
Visitors at Sugar Fest mingled among antique cars, food trucks and booths set up by more than 50 local vendors and kiosks.
The museum offered visitors a free tour inside the museum to view Julie Stewart's photography exhibit entitled “Raw Sugar: Harvest in Black and White” and “Water Trails of the Atchafalaya.”
The annual event in Port Allen celebrated the region's historical connection to the sugarcane harvest and the staple Louisiana traditions that are associated with harvest.
Some of the demonstrations using sugarcane included mule driven cane grinding, cane syrup boiling, and praline making. Visitors were also able to see the 22 foot working model of a sugar mill that was first displayed at the 1904 World's Fair in Saint Louis.
The West Baton Rouge Museum grounds were transformed into a bustling festival featuring tours and concerts by local legends. Despite the many activities and booths available on the museum grounds, visitors were spread evenly throughout the six acres.
Visitors, aged 21 and up, sipped on samples of liquor from Cane Land Distilling Company then took their two-step skills to the various bands that were playing. Local legend Lil' Ray Neal ended the event with a blues performance at the juke joint
Google parent company Alphabet reported a quarterly loss to set aside funds to pay taxes on repatriated profits, and named a new chairperson to replace outgoing Eric Schmidt.
Alphabet reported a loss of $3 billion for the fourth quarter as it set aside $11 billion for taxes. An estimated $9.9 billion was for taxes on repatriated earnings.
The California tech giant said revenues in the last three months of 2017 rose 24 percent from a year ago to $32.3 billion and cited "great growth" for the company.
The company used the earnings report announcing it had named board member and former Stanford University President John Hennessy as chairperson, replacing Schmidt, who announced their departure in December.
Hennessy has been a board member since 2004 and lead independent director since April 2007. The Google segment accounted for $31.9 billion in revenue and delivered an operating profit of $8.8 billion.
Gambia's Jammeh accuses ECOWAS of declaring war
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh has accused the West African regional bloc ECOWAS of declaring a war against their country amid an ensuing political crisis there.
In a New Year's speech broadcast on state TV, the Gambian president pledged to defend their country against what they called any foreign aggression.
Jammeh called the mediation by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as an insult to the Gambia's constitution.
“Let me make it very clear that we are ready to defend this country against any aggression … My government will never opt for such confrontation but defending our sovereignty is a sacred duty for all patriotic Gambians,” the president said, adding, “It is in effect a declaration of war and an insult to our constitution.”
Elsewhere in their remarks, the president questioned the role of the regional body as a genuine mediator. “ECOWAS has also disqualified (itself) to provide mediation services as a genuine mediator has to be neutral and impartial and win the trust and confidence of the parties to the conflict.”
Jammeh had initially accepted the results of the December 1 election, in which opposition leader Adama Barrow was declared the winner, but reversed their position more than a week later and called for a revote.
Their refusal to accept the results prompted political upheaval in the country, bringing pressure from the international community on them to accept the result and step down.
Leaders from ECOWAS have traveled to the Gambia in an attempt to strike a deal with the president to make them leave power.

ECOWAS has said that Jammeh must step down next month and vowed “to take all necessary action to enforce the results” of the election.
The Gambian military has already been deployed to civilian sites, such as the election commission headquarters, in a show of force by Jammeh.
Barrow says Jammeh lacks the constitutional authority to call for a new vote or to invalidate the election.
Several countries, the United Nations Security Council and international organizations have also called for a peaceful transition of power.
Jammeh seized power in a military coup in 1994 and has been in power ever since. They have long been under fire by human rights groups, who accuse them of torturing, imprisoning, or even sometimes killing their opponents.

United Nations: The UN has received an allegation of sexual abuse against unidentified members of the Nepalese contingent and called for a full investigation into the matter.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujjaric was responding to a question on allegations of child rape by a Nepali peacekeeper in South Sudan. They said any act of sexual abuse is "horrendous", in particular "one involving a child is especially heinous".
"The UN has informed, obviously, Nepal of the allegation. We've requested a full investigation be conducted by the troop-contributing country within the expedited timeframe of 90 days, jointly with a team of...from OIOS [Office of Internal Oversight Services]," they said.
Dujarric said Nepal's response on whether it will investigate the matter is expected by April 25. They reiterated that UNMISS, as well as the UN, has a “zero-tolerance” policy for sexual abuse and no excuse or second chance approach to child sexual exploitation and abuse.
"The Mission reiterates that such acts should be properly investigated, and where applicable, criminal prosecution be pursued under the law of the contributing country," Dujjaric said.
PENTICTON, B.C. — Time wasn't on Mary-Anne Arsenault's side at the Scotties Tournament of Hearts.
The Nova Scotia skip was initially challenged by the four-hour time difference between their Halifax home and Penticton for the Canadian women's curling championship.
Arsenault's team tried to prepare for the time difference by altering its sleep patterns prior to the Scotties.
“We talked about getting onto B.C. time, but it was such a short turn around from provincials to here,'' Arsenault said Friday. “We all work so we tried to squeeze in as much as we could. We said we would deal with it when we go to B.C. ''
The time difference has meant some late nights for their followers from the Dartmouth Curling Club.
“There were happy about the eight-end game (on Thursday),'' Arsenault said. “It was time for them to go to bed.''
The time difference hasn't been issue lately for Arsenault, who won their seventh consecutive game after Friday's 10-4 win over B.C.'s Kesa Van Osch.
Arsenault, Manitoba's Jennifer Jones and Team Wild Card Kerri Einarson were tied for first place with 8-2 records in the championship pool heading into Friday's late draw. The three skips are assured of at least a tiebreaker.
In the playoff hunt were Alberta's Casey Scheidegger (7-3), Northern Ontario's Tracey Fleury (7-3) and Team Canada's Michelle Englot (6-4). The results of Friday's late draw weren't available at press time.
The Page Playoffs begin Saturday with the 3 vs. 4 game (5 p.m. ET), followed by the 1 vs. 2 match (10 p.m. ET). The semifinal is Sunday (noon ET), followed by the final (7 p.m. ET).

At Apple's March Education Event, the company introduced a companion to its Everyone Can Code curriculum — Everyone Can Create. With Everyone Can Code, Apple sought to help schools and students implement programs from primary through post-secondary all based on the reality that programming is a form of communication with which everyone needs to be familiar. Everyone Can Create follows up on that with applicable, skills-based learning for music, photography, and video — everything you can do with the tools now powered by code. As much as Apple is often berated by It professionals in education for not providing rip-and-replace solutions identical to Microsoft of Google, and by budgeting offices for not making keyboard-equipped iPads as cheap as Chromebooks or Windows devices in school, what Apple is doing seems to be genuinely different. Apple never made beige boxes, office apps, and internet information servers to compete with Microsoft in Enterprise. The company never made budget handsets to compete with the free-with-Facebook carrier offerings. Apple has never been about being just another commodity. Especially not in education. What Apple is doing isn't just different in terms of approach, it's different in terms of philosophy.

Earlier today I got to watch the grade 7 and 8 students of Mazo de la Roche Public School test-drive Everyone Can Create at the McMichael Art Collection. The students were familiar with iPads — and had done some stunning work on them with fingers and third-party stylus pens — but this was their first time trying the Apple Pencil. As part of McMichael's Sketch Detectives program, the students came in and learned about native Canadian art. They got to see first-hand examples and hear about the history and meaning behind the work. Then, they were given iPads and Apple Pencils and asked to create their own works based on their own stories. The app they used was Tayasui Sketches School Getting the program up and running wasn't easy. Mazo de la Roche Public School has hundreds and hundreds of students and a faculty and parents that had to buy into the advantages of Apple's approach to education. But, over time, as the school rolled out everything from a green screen studio where the kids to record podcasts and videos, to paying special attention to kids with special needs or who were otherwise isolated and withdrawn from traditional approaches, they all started to see the value. Especially the students who, with an assortment of apps and mediums suddenly available to them, could find their voice and, though it, their agency.

Sony may have given Marvel Studios the right to use Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a seemingly very good decision for everyone involved, but that doesn't mean the studio is getting out of the comic book movie game. They are going to make use of the other Spider-Man characters they have, starting with an R-rated Venom movie that will star Tom Hardy in the lead role. Now we have word that the studio is plowing forward with the first of several Spidey spin-off movies, as Venom is reportedly going to be starting production in September.
According to Omega Underground, Sony will start shooting Venom on September 1 in both Atlanta, Georgia and New York City. Since the movie is currently slated to hit theaters on October 5, 2018, that timetable seems to make a lot of sense. There is no word yet on how long production is expected to last, but shoots for these kinds of movies often last several months, leaving plenty of time for post-production and reshoots, if need be. In rare cases, movies like Avengers: Infinity War, which are truly massive in scale, will have much longer shoots, but this probably isn't going to be one of those cases. Especially since Tom Hardy is quite the busy dude.
A lot of productions have been shooting in Atlanta Lately. Marvel Studios has been shooting a ton of movies there, such as a very good chunk of Spider-Man: Homecoming, which also shot in New York City as well, since that is where the webslinger resides. Venom, aka Eddie Brock, also calls NYC their home, which would explain why they will be shooting there, but it also presents some potential issues. How are they going to explain why Spider-Man is nowhere to be found if the Venom movie takes place in New York City? Will they even bother? Fans will surely want some kind of explanation. Granted, the general public may not care all that much, but it is a pretty glaring elephant in the room that will need to be addressed.
In addition to Venom, which is going to be directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland), Sony is also working on a Black Cat and Silver Sable movie. There is no word on a release date for that, or what other characters may be looking at getting their own movies, but Sony is planning on making use of what Marvel characters they have and is creating their own universe of movies, currently called Sony's Marvel Universe. It has been reiterated by both sides several times that these movies and characters will not cross over with the MCU, which presents all kinds of questions and, given Sony's track record with superhero movies over the last ten years, might make fans nervous.
As much as people may feel trepidation about a Venom movie that won't feature Spider-Man, there are reasons to feel good about this. For one, Tom Hardy is one of the best actors working today and they choose their projects carefully. The fact that they signed on for this is a big deal. Also, even if the movie winds up tanking, it won't affect anything over in the MCU, so there's really nothing to lose from the fan's perspective. Only some money for Sony to possibly lose.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's two main anti-establishment parties could yet form a government, after the man nominated as interim prime minister said politicians, rather than technocrats like himself, might be able to steer the country out of deadlock.
Wednesday's development came as financial markets calmed after a rout a day earlier when investor concerns about Italy's finances gave the yield on Italian 2-year bonds its biggest rise since 1992 and dented the euro's exchange rate.
The crisis started when the 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League abandoned their plan to form a coalition after the head of state vetoed their choice of 81-year-old eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona as finance minister.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli said possibilities had emerged "for the birth of a political government," and that financial market turmoil and other circumstances, "have caused me to wait for further developments."
A source close to President Sergio Mattarella, who vetoed Savona as finance minister and appointed Cottarelli to form a government to oversee fresh elections around the end of the year, said the two men had "decided together not to rush things, (to favour) a possible political government".
A source close to 5-Star, which emerged from inconclusive elections in March the single-biggest party in parliament, said the parties were now trying to find "a point of compromise on another name" for the economy ministry.
Laura Castelli, a lawmaker close to 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, said: "It's surprising that Paolo Savona, a person of great culture and a fine political sense, has not yet taken the decision to withdraw."
But League leader Matteo Salvini, who is surging in opinion polls, played down the notion that they and 5-Star would try again to form a coalition, saying Italy should have a snap election.
"The earlier we vote the better because it's the best way to get out of this quagmire and confusion," they told reporters.
UNCERTAINTY
On Tuesday, the prospect of a snap election - likely to lead to a eurosceptic government that could put Italy's euro zone membership in question - hit Italian bonds, shares and pushed the euro to multi-month lows.
A surprise breakthrough between the president and 5-Star/League would ease uncertainty but still usher in a coalition planning to ramp up spending in the heavily indebted nation and push for changes to European Union and euro zone fiscal rules.
But even with uncertainty remaining, Italy's government bond yields fell from multi-year highs on Wednesday and a smooth bond auction brought a degree of calm to a battered market.
"We are not yet at the point where investors refuse to lend money to Italy," said Roberto Coronado of PineBridge Investments.
In Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz played down the risk of the Italian crisis engulfing the currency area.
"One can say that Europe is better prepared for difficult situations than before. What is more, I am firmly convinced that the majority of Italians have a very pro-European stance. It is a European nation," they told Reuters.
Three officials at the European Central Bank told Reuters the ECB was not considering any intervention as indicators were not yet showing signs of stress among banks and the central bank did not have the tools or mandate to solve what they said was being treated as essentially a political crisis.

A Harrogate solicitor has been banned from being a solicitor after they avoided paying stamp duty land tax (SDLT).
The action has been taken on Richard Chan, aged 46, following a Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.
Declaring to the HMRC they had paid just £165,000 for a £525,000 house in Hampsthwaite
Declaring to the HMRC they had paid £100,000 for a £763,750 office in Harrogate
On both occasions the declared price meant they saved around £50,000 in stamp duty land tax payments.
Mr Chan did not appear in-person at the tribunal and did not present any mitigation to their actions.
From 1 July 2005 until September 2010, Chan was a member of Arc Property Solicitors LLP. From 1 June 2010 until 16 May 2014 they were a senior director of Abode Solicitors Limited. Abode traded as Arc Property Solicitors. On 4 October 2013, the SRA intervened into Abode.
The SRA closed down Abode Solicitors on 7 October, 2013.

Two Harrogate Solicitors Fined Following Multiple Failures
Chan told HMRC they had been advised at the time of the office purchase to insert an arbitrary figure as it was still unclear what the price was.
At the time of purchasing the office, Chan and their wife should have paid £30,500 in SDLT, given the property value of £763,750. On a tax return the respondent stated the price was £100,00. This was below the SDLT threshold at the time. HMRC imposed a penalty of more than £16,000 in full and final settlement.
The tribunal also found Chan had not told the SRA of the position with HMRC and that it had imposed a penalty on him. But it dismissed an allegation their firm had promoted SDLT avoidance schemes.
Chan paid a further penalty of £10,500 for tax avoidance in relation to the house purchase.The property was valued at £525,000 and SDLT of £21,000 was due. In a tax return a value of £165,00 was declared. This was below the SDLT threshold at the time.
After HMRC wrote to Chan in 2011, they had claimed to benefit from grandfathering rules which applied to certain tax avoidance schemes, but later withdrew this explanation. Tax officials said their failure to pay was deliberate in relation to the office and negligent in relation to the house.
The tribunal found dishonesty proven in relation to both purchases.
The tribunal also found Chan had not told the SRA of the position with HMRC and that it had imposed a penalty on him. But it dismissed an allegation their firm had promoted SDLT avoidance schemes.
Deaf since childhood, Razali Bin Mohamad Habidin has developed a closer bond with the creatures under their care than any other keeper at Singapore's Jurong Bird Park, where other staff refer to them simply as the "bird whisperer."
Razali, who lost 80 percent of their hearing after falling ill as a baby, started working at the park over two decades ago, and has risen to the position of deputy head avian keeper.
They communicate with the birds through grunts, gestures and body languages and told AFP that they recognize the birds by their "behaviors and personalities."
"All of them are my friends," they added, communicating through a mix of gestures and Malay.
Other staff at the park has dubbed the 48-year-old "the bird whisperer" - after the Hollywood film "The Horse Whisperer," starring Robert Redford as a trainer with a gift for understanding horses.
"He has a way of communicating with the birds that very few of us can," said assistant curator Angelin Lim. "Just by a look, they know whether or not the bird is well."
Communication with their colleagues can be more challenging than with the birds.
Razali leads about a dozen staff and giving them instructions usually involves them making various complex hand gestures, and then reading the lips of their colleagues when they respond.
Their way with the creatures at the park, which is home to more than 5,000 birds from parrots to hornbills, was on display as they brought a snack of palm fruits into an enclosure filled with parrots.
The hyacinth macaws, the world's largest parrots, stopped squawking and watched them curiously before following him.
One of the giant birds perched on their shoulder playfully rubbed their finger with its beak - a sign of trust and affection - and ate out of theirs hand.
Israel on Sunday ruled that it would not release to their families the bodies of Hamas members killed during attacks on Israelis, but would instead bury them, the government said.
The decision by the security cabinet followed the release on Saturday by the Palestinian group of video footage showing a mock birthday party for Israeli soldier Oron Shaul, believed by the army to have been killed in the 2014 Gaza war.
“The political-security cabinet discussed standing policy on treatment of the bodies of Hamas terrorists killed during terror attacks and decided that they will not be returned but will be buried,” a statement posted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official Twitter account said.
It did not elaborate on the burial plan, but said that the same meeting discussed ways of getting back the remains of soldiers killed in the 2014 Gaza war and obtaining the release of two Israeli civilians missing in Gaza and believed to be held by Hamas.
The statement said ministers adopted a “plan of action”, but gave no details.
Hamas spokesperson Fawzi Barhum said Sunday's decision on Hamas corpses was “evidence of criminality and barbaric occupation” by Israel.
“These decisions will not give positive results,” they told AFP in Arabic, without elaborating on the possible consequences.
In the past, Israel has buried the bodies of slain militants at secret locations in remote parts of the country.
Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said in a New Year's Eve statement that it had posted online “two video clips to mark the 23rd birthday of the Zionist soldier and prisoner Oron Shaul”.
The Israeli army believes that another soldier, Hadar Goldin, was killed along with Shaul two years ago and that Hamas holds their bodies as potential bargaining chips.
In September, a senior Israeli official said that Israel had been holding since the 2014 Gaza war 18 Palestinians from the enclave as well as the bodies of 19 others and “offered to swap them for the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers”.
But Lior Lotan, who is in charge of prisoners and missing persons, said at the time that Hamas rejected the offer.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) posted rare quarterly earnings misses on Friday as cost cuts and rising oil prices failed to offset weakness in international refining operations, sending shares of both companies plunging.
The results surprised Wall Street, where analysts had been steadily raising expectations due to stronger crude prices and a rebounding global economy, according to Thomson Reuters data.
But excluding U.S. tax benefits, results at both companies fell short of expectations, casting a cloud over the U.S. oil industry just days after the nation's output surpassed a milestone 10 million barrels per day.
“We got carried away with our expectations, and by we, I mean Wall Street as a whole,” said Oliver Pursche of wealth manager Bruderman Brothers LLC, which holds Exxon shares.
Exxon, Chevron and rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) all reported lower cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter despite higher oil and gas prices. Reasons varied, but included weaker refining profits and spending on capital expenses.
Shell, the world's second-largest publicly traded oil company after Exxon, managed to overtake its bigger rival for the first time in a key area, producing about 6 percent more cash last year than Exxon's $33.2 billion.
“What struck us the most was the decline in cash flow from operations at Exxon,” Pursche said.
Exxon's stock dropped 6 percent in Friday afternoon trading, the biggest one-day drop since August 2011. The stock had been making gains after hitting a low last summer, closing Thursday at a 52-week high. But Exxon shares are flat over the past year despite a 22 percent rise in the S&P 500 .SPX.
Analysts needled Exxon's director of investor relations, Jeff Woodbury, with unusually pointed questions about the cash flow drop on a Friday earnings conference call. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods did not participate in the call.
The frustration boiled over into the Chevron call, which followed Exxon‘s. Mike Wirth, in their second day as Chevron's CEO, described the refining weakness a one-time issue rather than a systemic problem.

While Wirth's answers did not seem to mollify all analysts, several thanked them for talking. “I really appreciate you coming on the call from time to time,” Barclays Capital analyst Paul Cheng said to Wirth. “I hope that at least one of your other major competitors will do the same.”
Chevron's shares were off more than 5 percent in afternoon trading. Both companies are part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, which fell more than 2 percent in late trading.
“It was a pair of disappointing results from both companies,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst at Edward Jones. “Is refining something to be concerned about as we move through 2018? Will that be an offset to those higher oil prices?”
Chevron said higher oil prices LCOc1CLc1, up 25 percent in 2017, and currency impacts hurt refining margins by $500 million in the quarter.
Both companies benefited from recent U.S. tax reform. Non-cash tax gains were $5.94 billion at Exxon and $2 billion at Chevron.
Excluding that tax change and other one-time items, Exxon earned 88 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Exxon's quarterly production fell 3 percent to 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the only gain coming from the United States. But its U.S. production business was unprofitable for the third year in a row.
At Chevron, production rose 2.6 percent. Excluding the tax change and other one-time items, the company earned 72 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
“I expect us to maintain capital cost and discipline,” Wirth said. “I intend to lead Chevron to win in any environment.”
France's Total SA (TOTF.PA) and the United Kingdom's BP Plc (BP.L) plan to post quarterly results later this month.
Prosecutors yesterday launched a criminal inquiry against Berna Laçin, an actor who sparked outrage in social media with an anti-Islamic tweet. The chief prosecutor's office in Istanbul said the actor is being investigated on charges of an "insult to the religious values of people."
"If the death sentence were a solution, Medine wouldn't break record in rapes," Laçin wrote in a July 3 tweet, using the Turkish name for the Saudi city of Medina, a sacred city for Muslims.
They were commenting on a debate for the introduction of the death sentence for pedophiles.
The tweet drew the public ire while some social media users called for a boycott of American multinational corporation Procter and Gamble as Laçin stars in ads for the company's cleaning products.

I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of the royal baby so when the Duke and Dutchess of Cambridge stepped out yesterday with their new bundle of joy in tow, I freaked out a little. I mean how good did Kate look mere hours after giving birth? If you're like me, you're hungry for any and all information about the latest addition to the royal family, including what the new royal baby's astrological sign is, and how it will shape theirs personality?.
The royal baby, who's name has yet to be revealed, is a Taurus, just like their big sister Charlotte, whose birthday is May 2. Those born under the Taurus sign, i.e. anyone born between April 20 and May 20, are known for loving the finer things in life. "A Taurus is happiest when surrounded by the best of everything," explained Astro Style. Fortunately for the royal baby, they were born into the lap of luxury so I anticipate he'll be one happy little guy.
The Taurus sign is also known for being responsible, and is one of the most reliable signs of the zodiac, according to Astrology Zodiac Signs. While the new royal baby will be fifth in line for the throne, and thus less likely to wear the crown than their two older siblings, it's reassuring to know that they are likely to possess reliable traits.

One of the things I'm most curious about is what the dynamic will be between big brother George, big sister Charlotte, and the littlest addition to the family. The zodiac can provide some answers here too. Those born under the Taurus sign are most compatible with Cancers and Scorpios, according to Astrology Zodiac Signs. And guess who happens to be a Cancer? You guessed it, George! That means that the two little boys in the family, Prince George and Baby #3, will likely get along swimmingly! And don't forget about dad, Prince William, who also happens to be a Cancer. Seems like there may be a boys alliance forming in the house!
And what about Princess Charlotte, who like their little brother, is also a Taurus? How will the two bull signs mesh? "There may be sibling head-butting with the two younger ones until they steak out their turf. A key phrase [for a Taurus] is 'Mine!'" said astrologer Ophira Edut, in an interview with Good Morning America.
Astrologically speaking, the new baby seems to already take after none other than the Queen herself, who was born on April 21, 1926. “To start it off, the little prince, who was born at 11:01 a.m., has their sun in Taurus and their Moon sign is Leo, which is the exact same combination as their great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II," explained astrologer Mirjam Schneider in an interview with Express.

The 92-year-old Queen, who welcomed the arrival of their new great-grandson with a horseback ride through the grounds of Windsor Castle, just celebrated their birthday two days prior to their birth with a televised concert at London's Royal Albert Hall, according to People. Now that's a lot of activity for the royal family!
It will be fun in the coming months and years to see the new royal baby's personality develop. Prince George seems every bit a ham, while Princess Charlotte seems like a poised little lady. Will Baby #3 be the wild card of the family?
"This is not a child who will enjoy being (only) third in line to the throne. In fact, as a young man, they will be extremely ambitious," explained astrologist Jessica Adams. "This is a person who wants to get to the top. They may do what Princess Anne has done, and create a separate career for themselves elsewhere."
I can't wait to see if she's right! And now we just need the adorable little guy's name...

Singer Robbie Williams is set to rejoin Take That as the group come together for the final of singing show Let It Shine.
They will join the panel as a guest judge, as well as give a special performance with Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald.
The BBC show's final, which airs on Saturday, February 25, will see three groups of singers battle it out for the opportunity to star in a West End musical based on Take That's biggest hits.
They will each perform twice in front of judges Williams, Barlow, Dannii Minogue and Martin Kemp, before a public vote is opened.
Williams, who left Take That in 1995 before briefly rejoining to create the Progress album in 2010, said: "I'm looking forward to being back with Gary, Mark and Howard on Let It Shine and am excited to be a guest judge for the very special final."
Launched early last month, the show has featured a number of guest judges, including Glee star Amber Riley, pop veteran Lulu and, for this weekend's semi-final, singer Ashley Roberts.
Let It Shine returns to BBC One at 6.55pm on Saturday.
How do you make sure you don't lose your photos, messages, and other data? Back up you iPhone and iPad now!
Your iPhone or iPad store all your photos, messages, health data, documents, accessory setups, settings, and more. In other words, your memories and your preferences. Your data is important, even precious, and should be treated as such. The best way to secure your data is to back it up. You can back up your iPhone or iPad via iCloud, or directly on your computer using iTunes. Before you download any software, you should always back up your device. You should also maintain a regular backup routine, just in case something happens to your iPhone or iPad, like getting lost or stolen.
What is a backup?
A backup of your iPhone or iPad includes your device settings, app data, Home screen and app organization, iMessages and texts, ringtones, your visual voicemail passcode, health data, and HomeKit configurations. Photos, and videos are only backed up if you don't already have iCloud Photo Library enabled on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
You can use iCloud to back up your device, or you can connect to iTunes on your computer. It's up to you. The main difference is where your backups are stored. iCloud backups are stored in iCloud and iTunes backups are stored locally on your Mac or PC.
If you back up your iPhone or iPad using iCloud, you'll be able to access and them anywhere using Wi-Fi. If you back up your device using iTunes, you have to use the computer you store the backups on to access them.
How to enable iCloud backup on your iPhone or iPad
Using iCloud as a backup location for your iPhone or iPad is a great idea. If anything happens to your phone or tablet, you will have a backup you can access from anywhere with an internet connection. But before you can start backing up to iCloud, you have to make sure that iCloud backups are enabled on your device.
Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. Tap on iCloud. Tap on Backup. Turn on iCloud Backup by moving the slider to the right. You will be warned that your iPhone will no longer back up to your computer automatically. Tap on OK. iCloud will attempt to start a backup your data every 24 hours or so, as long as your iPhone or iPad is connected to Wi-Fi and plugged in to charge. Most of the time this will happen while you sleep.
If you've never backed up to iCloud before, the first backup can take a while. After that, iCloud will only upload the changes you've made since the last backup, which is much faster.
How to manually trigger an iCloud backup
iCloud backups should automatically happen at least once a day: They trigger when your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch is plugged in and on Wi-Fi. That said, here's how to make sure you have an up-to-the-minute backup solution.
Launch the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. Select iCloud Tap on Backup. Tap on Back Up Now. Keep in mind: If you want to back up your iPhone or iPad to iCloud, you must first have an iCloud account and be signed in to it. If you don't and aren't sure how to make one, here's how to go about doing it.
How to enable iTunes backups
If you don't want to store your device backups in iCloud, you can store them locally on your computer instead.
Connect your device to your computer. Open iTunes. Click on the Device icon next to the category dropdown menu on the left side of the iTunes window. Select Summary from the sidebar. Select This computer under Automatically Back up. Tick the box for Encrypt local backup to ensure that your passwords, health, and HomeKit data is backed up. You'll have to create a password to protect your encrypted backups. The password will be automatically stored in Keychain. Click Done when you are finished.
How to back up your iPhone or iPad manually via iTunes
If you have enabled iTunes backups, your device will back up automatically when you connect it to your computer. You can also manually back up your iPhone or iPad if you want to make a new backup while it is still connected.
Connect your device to your computer. Open iTunes. Click on the Device icon next to the category dropdown menu on the left side of the iTunes window. Select Summary from the sidebar. Select Back Up Now under Manually Back Up and Restore. Click Done when you are finished.

Pickle at Drag Queen Story Hour Courtesy Siran Babayan
On a Sunday at Stories Books in Echo Park, Michelle Tea takes the stage to introduce a room full of parents and kids to Pickle, their storyteller for the day.
“Drag queens wear very glamorous, pretty and fantastical dresses, sometimes fantastical pants," Tea explains. "They wear lots of beautiful makeup, sometimes they're very glittery. They're always feminists. They get to run around with their drag queen friends, and they get to sing and dance and tell stories. And we're very lucky to have one here today.”
Pickle emerges in a pink gown with a slit, Rita Hayworth–style wig, tarantula eyelashes and lavender acrylic nails. Pickle may be the tallest person the children here have ever seen; she's 6 foot 3 and even taller in their nude pumps, which their clutch purse perfectly matches.
“My fairy godmother gave me these really magical nails,” Pickle says. “So if you see one fly off of my hand, I want everyone to scream really loud, because they said they aren't gonna give me another set.”
And with that, the inaugural Drag Queen Story Hour is off and running. Pickle first reads Judy Sierra's Wild About You!, a story about a kangaroo and a panda couple at the zoo; each adopts a baby, which the other animals help raise, because “to bring up a baby … it takes a whole zoo!” Next they read Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell's And Tango Makes Three, which is based on the real-life Roy and Silo, two male penguins at the Central Park Zoo in New York, who behaved like a couple and raised a girl penguin named Tango, “because it takes two to make a Tango.”
“I want everyone to shout a very special word,” Pickle instructs after they finish reading. “Love!”
“Performing for gay men is exactly the same as performing for children,” says Pickle, who performs in drag at various local gay bars and clubs, and hosts a weekly trivia night at Bar Mattachine downtown. (She's also starred in one-man shows, including Peg Bundy Has an Existential Crisis.) “They're just in bigger bodies. I just employ the same tactics I use for hosting trivia, but without the swear words. Gay men have no attention span; the children are actually a little bit more engaged.”
Monica Deamer brought their 2-year-old son, Reed, to Drag Queen Story Hour. They told them they were going to a story time with a “fancy lady who's gonna be very funny.”
“I find drag queens very inspiring,” Deamer says. “I'd like my son to grow up knowing that there are lots of ways of expressing yourself, and to be whoever you are inside, because inside is what matters.”
Pickle with fan Bridget Courtesy Pickle
Tea began the first Drag Queen Story Hour in December 2015 in San Francisco, where they were director of RADAR Productions, a queer-centric literary nonprofit, which produces, among other events, the ongoing open-mic tour Sister Spit. (Tea also has written several memoirs, novels and young-adult books, and co-authored Gossip singer Beth Ditto's 2009 autobiography, Coal to Diamonds: A Memoir.) They wanted to create a kid-friendly gathering that would bridge the gap between gay and straight parents in the increasingly gentrified Castro district. Kids get to interact with fabulously dressed drag queens while listening to not only classic fairy tales involving princesses and princes but also stories that teach them about feminism, gender identity and adoptive and blended families. The monthly readings take place at libraries and bookstores and have attracted as many as 135 people. Michael Roybal-Gonzales, who runs a local children's boutique and helped Tea organize the first L.A. storytelling, says that most of the parents who attend are heterosexual “but like-minded thinkers.”
“I always thought that drag queens and kids would be a really great mix,” says Tea, who currently lives in Eagle Rock with their wife, Dashiell Lippman, and their 2-year-old son, Atticus. “Drag queens are performers, and when they go out they just want to interact. The books we choose are about social justice, not just Green Eggs and Ham. They're about families being made by choice and love and community, and less about biology. They teach them that there's a million different kinds of families. It's as much about education as is it about joy and creativity.”
The series has since branched out to Brooklyn, where it's hosted by Feminist Press, which has published some of Tea's books. One recent storyteller was Honey Mahogany, who was a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race. Upcoming events will take place in March at the Open Space Café & Theater in West Hollywood, and in April at the LAB in Eagle Rock, as well as RuPaul's DragCon.
“They're so open-minded,” Pickle says, referring to kids. “They don't have that prejudice built into them yet. They're like a blank slate. They don't have boundaries. They take everything at face value. They just think of me as this big princess. And that's why something like this is so important.”
Q. Sun exposure is good for your hair.
A. True
“Of course – everything in small quantities,” says Syd Hayes, Hairstylist & Ambassador at L'Oréal Paris. “vitamin D is so important for hair; it helps with hair growth and our general health. People forget to sunblock their scalp which is one of my big tips. Use a Q tip to help you put sunblock on your parting!”
So there is no way it can be damaging?
“The perfect summer holiday definitely can be. Sun, salt water and chlorine all can cause damage to hair and the best things to do is prevent this all from happening before you hit the beach or even get to your sun destination,” explains Syd. “Coloured hair including Balayage or even the perfect set of Highlights can be over oxidised in the sun and end up looking brassy dry and damaged.”
Q. You CAN counter these effects.
A. True
“Yes – deep conditioning mask treatments are great. Botanicals Coriander Strength Cure Shampoo by L'Oréal Paris is epic for strengthening your hair and revitalising the hair from root to tip. Also Kerastase have an amazing spray called Soleil Aqua Seal with UV filters to protect against sun sea and chlorine. Make sure to turn down the heat on your electrical hair tools!”
Q. Using heated tools damages hair.
A. False
Provided the temperature is controlled – under 185 degrees – the damage is minimum. Anything above 185 is considered to destroy the keratin within your hair strands, resulting in broken, dead hair.
Q. Taking supplements isn't a hoax – they are good for you.
A. True
“The new and exciting Hair Pills by Ouai are excellent for both oily & dry hair. Take one of these each day and your hair will look and feel healthier than ever.”
Q. Shampooing your hair everyday is good for you.
A. False
In general, yes – if you clean you hair everyday it strips the follicles of their natural oils, leading to split ends and dull looking hair. Your scalp can also dry out, causing dandruff and hair loss, while colour fades at a faster rate when washed everyday.

Ethan Hawke is barely recognizable in Maudie, a new drama from Sony Classics. The veteran actor plays one of the most unusual, but eventually endearing characters of their storied career. Maudie Dowley (Sally Hawkins) was a diminutive, crippled woman who would become Canada's greatest folk painter. Maudie had juvenile arthritis. They were abandoned by their awful brother after their parent's death. Forced to live with a mean aunt, Maudie took their life into their own hands. They answered an ad in a local Novia Scotia store for a housekeeper.
Everett Lewis (Ethan Hawke) was an irascible fishmonger who lived in a tiny, 12 x 12 house. A solitary man of few words, they were surprised to see this tiny woman ask for employment. Maudie was a live in maid under tough circumstances. They had to sleep in the same bed. They barely tolerated their presence and was abusive at times. Maudie began to paint their little house. They also painted cards that Everett would also sell with the fish. A famous New York art dealer who was vacationing in Canada saw their work, and then commissioned them to do bigger paintings.
Maudie and Everett got married. They decided to sell their paintings by the side of the road. They became renowned for their folksy, beautiful artworks. Maudie even painted for Richard Nixon. All the while, they and Everett remained in their tiny house. They painted very inch of it. Them health declined dramatically over the years. Everett took care of her, establishing a deep bond that is the heart of this wonderful film. Sally Hawkins is a clear early awards contender. She's amazing as Maudie.
Ethan Hawke is the definition of cool. They walk into our interview with their trademark moustache and big smiles. They were so proud of the film, the rave reviews, and the spotlight on their costar's performance. Their portrayal of Everett is very physical and mannerism based. The character does not have a lot of dialogue. The love story between Maudie and Everett is a truly unique tale, wondrous to see. Hawke excels in these small, deeply personal relationship stories. Just as in the Linklater films with Julie Delpy, and Boyhood with Patricia Arquette, they give Sally Hawkins the space to be great. It's unselfish acting and a rarity in Hollywood. Please see our full interview with Ethan Hawke below:
Sally Hawkins is incredible in this film. Did you know of their work previously? Was they the reason you wanted to do this?
Ethan Hawke: Yes, I have been a big fan of Sally Hawkins. I had a great belief in their ability in this role. I was excited about the possibility. For example, I read Training Day when Denzel was already attached. So I read the script picturing Denzel Washington. What's they going to do with that scene? I wanted to be in that movie. It was something special. If they could have the right partner, then this thing could be ice hot. That's the way my brain thinks. I read this script the same way. This is a really complicated character. This woman [Sally Hawkins] could do it. I've spent a lot of time in Nova Scotia, so I could kind of picture this man. What they might look like? What they might sound like? I know these guys. I saw a window of opportunity here.
You and Sally have amazing screen chemistry? Especially when considering most of the scenes are in that tiny house. How much rehearsal time did you have together?
Ethan Hawke: The drag is we had all of these great plans for rehearsal. But I was shooting Magnificent Seven. It went over and over and over. We had all of these rainstorms. So I was late showing up for this film. They wouldn't let me go, blah blah. I had to work on everything by myself. I showed up a week before filming. Sally was painting three to four hours a day. They had a dance teacher, a body movement person, who helped them study juvenile arthritis. They were perfecting their Canadian accent. It became clear to me that I was working with someone who was working on perfection, a high level of excellence. So you just dive right in. The fun thing about these movies is also the hardest thing. We're in the middle of nowhere.
Newfoundland right?
Ethan Hawke: Yes, my kids weren't there, no friends. My wife wasn't there. My life wasn't there. So I took my imagination and disappeared into this character. That's what Sally and I did.
Everett married Maudie when they were forty. They were so gruff and irascible...
Ethan Hawke: Yes, they were a World War I vet. When I discovered that...the Canadians sent a bunch of people to World War I...they came back different. They didn't want to talk to anybody. That's war. They grew up in an orphanage. Joined the war, came back, and lived by themselves in a 12 x 12 house. They were a pretty haunted guy I think. They were scared to be intimate with a woman, to let someone in their heart and space. That's not something they were interested in.
A lot of people view Everett as an abusive guy that never loved Maudie, but just exploited them for the painting money. Do you think that might be true?
Ethan Hawke: (Emphatically) That's not true. I've read that as well. Look, they were definitely a tough guy. They didn't see art as art. They thought people were idiots to pay for these things. But it's clear at the end of their life that they had deep and powerful feelings for them This is what I love about the story.  They are a very serious misogynist. They only sees them as a maid. They have no ability to let a woman near him. They end of marrying here. Then they spend many years together. They ended up feeding her, washing her, getting their paint boards, taking them all over their world. I was very moved by that. If that's true in any sense, then I am not interested in that.
(pauses)
Ethan Hawke: Years ago when I did that Chet Baker thing, I interviewed a guy that played with Chet for ten years. I told them I read this book that said all these horrible things about Chet. Was that true? They said, "F*ck that book. I gave that guy three days of interviews. I told them in one hour of that time how Chet and I burglarized a dealer. The one bad thing in those three days of interviews, us committing a crime, shows up in that book". That was all that made it in. Chet even played the guy that did the documentary about him. These people didn't realize that Chet was acting for them. We all know books and documentaries can be manipulated. So let's face it then. We don't know the truth. I feel that Everett lived with this woman for thirty years. They celebrated their art. I see the story I want to tell from him.
What about the scene where they slap her?
Ethan Hawke: Well, we are looking at the issue of misogyny with 2017 eyes. Sadly, it was common for these men to hit their wives at that time. It was rampant. To not show it or it would make it wrong. So is they an abuser using modern standards of storytelling? In truth, the world is a complicated place.  They are f*cked up for all their behavior. There's a lot of bad behavior there, but that doesn't mean they are incapable of love or being loved. As an example, my mother is going through all of these complicated feelings about my grandfather. They felt neglected. They just found out from a neighbor, about how they helped another young woman who was addicted to heroin. My mother doesn't recognize this person. People are weird. I find all these issues are interesting. When I read that they slap her, I thought 90% of the audience will hate this character for the rest of the movie. What could I do to let them get to know him? It doesn't make the behavior okay. I am not saying that. I'm saying there's a possibility for understanding and forgiveness, if you have insight. A good movie humanizes people. Ah, I see where they're coming from. That's the value of telling stories. We improve our insight of people and the world around us.
Talk about the shooting schedule. This was a small film. Was it a difficult shoot?
Ethan Hawke: Four weeks, two actors shooting in a 12 x 12 room. (laughs) The trick to this movie was letting yourself disappear into that world. We had a wonderful director; an Irish woman [Aisling Walsh] who really embraces actors. Some directors are really excited about this new camera they're going to use to do a 360 shot around you. This director was excited about human nuance. It's exciting to be around them They were hunting for good acting, good portrayals. In many ways I don't remember making this movie.
So it was a lot of instinct, closeness with Sally?
Ethan Hawke: Yes, I enjoyed the hell out of it. Even working in the fields. It's rare to have a three dimensional character who's not just one thing. It's a full blown love story and we never kiss. (laughs) I don't know if I've ever seen anything like this.
Where did you get Everett's grunting from?
Ethan Hawke: It's the whole thing that made me want to do the part. I have a cabin in Nova Scotia that I got when I was divorced. I've been going up there for fifteen years. I know who this guy is. They remind me of a lobster fisherman I know. I knew their deal. There's something about a guy who lives out there in a tiny house all by himself. He's something like a bear, grunts, eats fish. (laughs)
The final question is about your choices. From working with Julie Delpy in the Linklater films, to Boyhood, to here with Sally Hawkins, you've made these very close, emotional stories with women. Why take these personal roles? What's the motivation?
Ethan Hawke: I appreciate that question. It's my secret priority. It's not gender specific for me. You a sports fan?
Definitely, big time...
Ethan Hawke: Why does every team that Jason Kidd plays on win? Why? I find it fascinating.
That's a great analogy...
Ethan Hawke: Thanks, I've watched their whole career. The guy had a decent shot, decent moves, but they never had said Carmelo Anthony's talent. My favorite thing about acting is that it is a collective art form. Set designers, costume designers, actors, writers, music, that's what is beautiful. It's a hodge podge of art. If you can figure out how to help other people excel, it feels pretty good, and you know what, you excel too. Figuring out what Julie needs to be great. I watched all of Denzel's movies before Training Day. When are they at their best? He's best with Gene Hackman, Viola Davis. They blow people off the screen. You can't let that happen. You don't defer. You need to be a good screen partner. It's very meaningful to me to be a part of great acting performances. If Sally Hawkins has a decent Everett, then Maudie is not a TV movie. It will be cinema. And it will be good for me. I'm not a selfless little monkey. (laughs) Jason Kidd did win a title.
Maudie will be released in the United States on June 16th. From Sony Pictures Classics, Maudie is directed by Aisling Walsh and written by Sherry White. The film stars Sally Hawkins, Ethan Hawke, Gabrielle Rose, and Zachary Bennett.

The provincial government launched the program in November 2015 aimed at recovering money paid in connection with public contracts obtained as a result of fraud or fraudulent tactics.
It gave businesses and individuals two years to voluntarily make such payments for contracts dating as far back as 1996.

When you have a newborn baby, trying to balance night feedings, diaper changes, and your own desperate need for sleep become a never-ending battle. Why on earth would you add another creature to the equation? Well, surprisingly, there are actually benefits to adopting a dog when a newborn is in the picture, and they just might send you to the shelter today.
In many cases, adding a dog to the family when your child is very young can pay off in health benefits. "Yes, having a dog in the house early can protect against wheezing or respiratory infections. But this exposure has to happen very early in life," said Karen DeMuth, assistant professor of pediatrics at Atlanta's Emory University, in WebMD. If you wait until your kid is older, and possibly already develops asthma or other respiratory problems, then introducing a dog not have the same effects. To max out the health benefits, adding a dog to your family ASAP may be a good idea.
As with any other major life decision, it's important to make sure the time is right to bring a dog into your home. After all, the last thing you want is to generate even more stress at this intense time in your life. But if you were set on getting a dog in the near future anyway, there are several potential benefits to raising your infant alongside a dog. (Hint: consider adopting an older dog if you don't want to raise two babies at the same time.)
1 Lower Risk Of Pet Allergies For Your Kid Giphy As anyone who suffers from them can attest, pet allergies totally suck. But they may be preventable. Infants who grow up with a dog in the home tend to have fewer allergies to the animal later in life, according to a 2011 study in Clinical & Experimental Allergy. Babies who grow up with dogs underfoot may have more robust immune systems in this respect later on.
2 Decreased Respiratory Illnesses For Your Kid Giphy This boost to the immune system may not be limited to allergies, either. Children who grow up with dogs have fewer respiratory infections than pet-free peers, according to a 2012 study in Pediatrics. Something about the presence of a dog in the home appears to help kids develop a robust immune system.
3 Lower Stress For You Giphy If there were ever a time you need to de-stress, it's when you're caring for a newborn. Thankfully, interacting with a pet dog is known to increase levels of oxytocin in people, meaning stress reduction is a potential benefit to dog ownership, according to a 2012 study in Frontiers in Psychology. Hey, the dog will be happy to keep you company during those endless nighttime feedings, hopefully making the whole parenting thing a little easier.
4 Lower Blood Pressure For You Giphy The health benefits of dogs just keep adding up. In fact, simply petting your dog can lower your blood pressure, according to WebMD. It helps the dog chill out, too, so everybody wins.
5 More Activity For The Whole Family Giphy Dogs help their owners get out and about more. Dog owners tend to get more physical activity than people without pooches, according to a 2008 study of Californians in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health. Even on days when you're really not in the mood to move, the dog will encourage you to take a trip around the block anyway.
6 Decreased Risk Of Asthma Giphy Being around the family dog as a baby may help your kid out later on. Children exposed to dogs during the first year of life had a reduced risk of asthma in later childhood, according to a 2016 study in Evidence-Based Medicine. Because asthma can be such a tough condition, anything that decreases its risk is worthwhile.

The war of words between the US and North Korea is generating headlines, amid growing fears it could erupt into a real confrontation. Almost 80% of Americans believe North Korea is capable of launching a missile that could hit the US, despite many experts saying Pyongyang's weapons are not sophisticated enough.
RT's Daniel Hawkins has been taking a look at who actually benefits from this scaremongering.
Days after a report suggested that the S Pen on the Galaxy Note 9 will feature Bluetooth support, new leaks via the US FCC website confirm that it will indeed be a Bluetooth device.
The details reveal the S Pen, bearing model number EJ-PN960, to be a 2.4 GHz Bluetooth LE (low energy) device. The listing does not reveal anything towards what Samsung's stylus will be capable of, but considering it does include Bluetooth support, it could be used as a trigger for multiple purposes. This ranges from controlling music playback to a trigger for selfies, as well as being a dedicated button to launch Bixby or a note-taking app.
Samsung has not openly dropped any clues yet, but it has been hinting that the S Pen will be one of the focus areas of this year's Galaxy Note 9 launch. Samsung's website, which has a teaser image of the Note 9 launch, also reveals what very clearly looks like the S Pen.
The details of the S Pen on the US FCC website also shows up just days after the Galaxy Note 9 and the Galaxy Tab S4 received certifications from the regulatory body.
The Galaxy Note 9 along with the Samsung Gear S4 and the Galaxy Tab S4 are expected to be announced globally at an event on 9 August, 2018, with an India launch expected to follow within the same month.

Addressing Mental Health Issues
By Najma Bibi Noor Mahomed
The month of Ramadan brings an array of activities for Muslims to increase their spirituality. One such opportunity to gain closeness to our Creator is the spiritual retreat, called the'tikaf. Muslims from across the globe participate in I'tikaf. It is a practice which sees observant Muslims secluded in s masjid for a number of days, devoting oneself to ibadah.
This usually happens during the last 10 days of Ramadan. Men would make the intention, bid farewell to their loved ones and call the masjid their home as they seek spiritual closeness.
The Fiqh of I`tikaf
I`tikaf means ‘remaining' somewhere.
The technical usage of the term is:
a) for men: to remain in the mosque, with an intention,
b) for women: to remain in their designated prayer area (musalla) at home, with intention, or at the mosque (though it is normally somewhat disliked for them to do so).
According to Shaykh Faraz Rabbani, the`tikaf is a means of great reward. The benefits of I'tikaf are immense, as the person committing to this form of retreat has:
–submitted their entire person to the worship of Allah Most High;
– seeks closeness;
– distances themselves from the worldly distractions that prevent one from proximity;
– drowning their entire time in actual or effective worship, for the basis of its legislation is to wait from one prayer time to the next prayer in congregation;
– it also makes the one in retreat resemble the angels who do not disobey the command of Allah and do what they are commanded, while glorifying Allah by night and day without tiring…” [1.212]
There are two types of I'tikaf, the sunnah itekaf and the nafl itekaf.
Why do we perform itekaf in the last ten days?
Mualima Gadija Allie explains that the last ten days has been earmarked for the sunnah I'tikaf because Laylatul Qadr can be found in any of the last 10 nights of Ramadan, which are the most blessed nights of the year.
“The intention as to why people sit in these 10 days is so that people can be in a state of ibadah when the night is found,” Mualima explained.
Should women also perform I'tikaf?
I'tikaf is practised by both males and females. Males usually make their way to the masjid to perform I'tikaf whereas woman usually use a space cordoned off in the home.
“Woman are encouraged to perform I'tikaf in the home. What woman would do is make the intention of nafl I'tikaf and which means they would take out sections of their day and prepare a section in the home as their I'tikaf space,” Mualima Gadija points out.
How can a woman create a balance of running a household and gain spiritual closeness?
“Before we step into the last 10 days we need to intensify our ibadah and we can do that by getting our cleaning and chores out of the way. Women can make extra meals and freeze them so that they can focus more on Ibadah and spend less time in the kitchen,” Mualima advised.

Rumors of a full-fledged Spice Girls reunion have just gotten a huge boost thanks to new pictures of all 5 of women together shared by Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice). The entire Spice Girls line-up has not been seen together since the 2012 London Olympic Closing Ceremony where they last performed. Ever since then, rumors have been swirling about a full reunion with a tour and album. It isn't clear if that's in the cards, but as Emma Bunton said in one of the photos, "the future is looking Spicy."
Victoria Beckham, Geri Horner (Ginger Spice), Melanie Brown (Scary Spice), Emma Bunton, and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) reunited at Horner's home in London to discuss the future of the Spice Girls. Their manager, Simon Fuller, was also spotted walking into the house. Beckham shared the first photo and captioned it with, "Love my girls!!! So many kisses!!! X Exciting x."
The Spice Girls are the biggest selling British girl group of all time, selling over 85 million records worldwide. The 5-piece reunited for a massively successful tour in 2007 and as previously noted, they last performed at the 2012 London Olympic Closing Ceremony. The women even had a hit movie in 1997 with Spice World, which earned over $100 million at the box office. A lot has happened since then and there have been constant talks of a reunion ever since 2012. Last year, Victoria Beckham responded to rumors of a 2018 reunion by saying, "It is not happening." They went on to say that Girl Power is still alive and well but said that they were not getting back together.
It looks like Victoria Beckham may have changed their tune. Although nothing is confirmed, it certainly looks like there is something in the works for the future of the Spice Girls. 2018 marks the 20th anniversary of the breakup of the group, so there could be some pretty massive offers on the table for a full-scale reunion of the world-famous group. Or, it could be something small like getting together for a commercial. At this point, it's too early to tell, so it's best to sit back and let the reunion photo spice up your life on its own for now. The group did release this statement to Entertainment Weekly
"We have enjoyed a wonderful afternoon catching up and reminiscing about the amazing times we have spent together. We are always overwhelmed at how much interest there is across the whole world for the Spice Girls. The time now feels right to explore some incredible new opportunities together. We all agree that there are many exciting possibilities that will once again embrace the original essence of the Spice Girls, while reinforcing our message of female empowerment for future generations."
Longtime manager Simon Fuller told the Sun that there was a secret meeting held to talk about the possibilities of "TV projects in China, a new TV talent show, endorsement deals, and a compilation album celebrating their greatest hits." The one hold back is that Victoria Beckham does not want to provide new vocals to any possible upcoming songs.
Each of the Spice Girls has tried a solo career, but none of them really took off and they definitely did not compare to the world dominance that the 5 original women had. The reunion tour earned over $70 million, so it's assumed that a new reunion tour could bring in at least that much, not including endorsements and merchandising. We'll just have to wait and see what the Spice Girls do next, but for now, just enjoy knowing that they all reunited on Instagram.

PanARMENIAN.Net - German police Wednesday, February 15 searched the homes of four Turkish Muslim preachers on suspicion they spied for President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government, officials said, according to AFP.
The imams are accused of reporting on Turkish followers of US-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who Erdoğan blames for last July's failed coup attempt against him.
The four imams allegedly passed on information through the Turkish consulate in the western city of Cologne to the Turkish Religious Affairs Directorate, known as Diyanet, prosecutors said.
"The purpose of today's searches is to gather further evidence on the alleged activities of the accused," prosecutors said after the raids in the western states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate.
News site Spiegel online reported the imams belong to Ditib, an organisation controlled by Ankara that manages some 900 mosques or religious communities in Germany.
The Erdoğan government has cracked down hard on followers of Gulen, who denies they were behind the attempted putsch.
More than 41,000 people have been arrested over their suspected links to Gulen's movement, and 100,000 fired or suspended. Many of them are teachers, police, magistrates and journalists.
The government says the purges are necessary to clean the state of the "virus" of Gulen's movement, which encourages its members to work in public services.
Human rights activists have fiercely criticised the magnitude of the crackdown, saying it has gone well beyond alleged coup plotters.
“I knew a bright red blood spot on pristine white pants would make a statement in a society that rarely takes the time to actually read — that catching people's eye with something a little more shocking might be necessary to snap them out of their social media scrolling.”
If this is your routine social media scroll through, then please pause a moment and reflect. That's all they ask. That's all an article that is honest, powerful and breaking-your-taboos deserves – a moment of reflection to channel a better response. It's never about bringing a consensus on an issue but sparking a positive conversation.
Yoga instructor Stephanie (Steph) Góngora is moving through their usual routine in their Instagram post. Handstands, arm balances, and hanumasana. Only, there's blood all over their white pants.
 They are in their periods, is practicing yoga and is bleeding profusely. Steph's video is an answer to their self-inquiry – why do we care? Constantly enveloped in worry about leaks and the subsequent embarrassment, Steph finally decided to embrace this natural process that gives our species continuity and initiate conversations on an otherwise taboo subject.
We don't talk periods. Shrouded in black thaili, we are never taught to discuss menstrual cycles directly. It wasn't until I graduated that I acknowledged it in front of the male members of my family. Coming from “Tabiyat theek nahi hai” to “I am down” took a long time.
Why shy away?
Steph's video asks important questions. The right way or the wrong is disputable. But like they say, in an age of social media scrolling, perhaps this is the only way! To give shocking headlines that make a reader stop and click.
Steph's attempt is commendable. Does that mean stop using pads or tampons? No. Does that mean to talk more about it and create a safe space for women to speak about their periods? Yes.
This past month has been very educative. From reading about an artist using their menstrual blood to nourish Tulsi plants, an eco-conscious woman adopting menstrual cups to reduce waste and now this. Women are discussing blood flow and how!
But there's something else that needs due consideration. Firstly, the taboos are greater in areas without internet access and where people don't understand social media. Secondly, is it appropriate to use the medium and culture of yoga to talk about it? Yogis discourage inversions and certain yogic poses during periods. Inversions cause the blood to flow against the natural flow of body and in certain cases overstretch the uterus causing heavier bleeding a few reports suggest.
I wonder then, is there a more positive method of education? We resort to drama and attention to make our points loud and clear and heard. Is it that difficult to listen to each other?
Nevertheless, considering this is how we, as a species, are progressing (and unless we settle down in our hurried lives) well done Steph!
EUGENE, Ore. — Sabrina Ionescu had 28 points and 11 assists to lead No. 6 Oregon to a 91-54 victory over No. 25 California on Friday night.
Ruthy Hebard added 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Ducks (21-3, 10-1 Pac-12), who have won 13 of their last 14 games. Ionescu's double-double was their 11th of the season and helped Oregon to its largest margin of victory in a conference game this season.
Jaelyn Brown led the Golden Bears (15-7, 6-5) with 14 points and Alaysia Styles added 12. Kristine Anigwe, California's leading scorer at 17.5 points per game, had just six to go with eight rebounds.
After a sluggish first quarter, Oregon pulled away with a 10-0 run in the second to take a 46-29 lead at the break. Ionescu had 15 points in the first half.
The Ducks dominated inside with a 40-28 rebound margin and 20-10 edge in second-chance points.
Ionescu was 9 of 13 from the field and 4 of 7 from 3-point range as Oregon finished 34 of 66 overall for 51.5 per cent. The Golden Bears shot 21 of 55 for 38.2 per cent.
BIG PICTURE
Oregon improved the nation's best home record to 14-0 after being bumped off the No. 4 line for the top seed in the Spokane Region by Notre Dame in Thursday's latest reveal by the NCAA selection committee. The Ducks are now fifth, with UConn, Mississippi State and Louisville holding the top three spots.
California, which is trying to reach the NCAA Tournament for the sixth time in Lindsay Gottlieb's seventh season as coach, is 0-7 against top 25 teams and 0-2 against the top 10. The Golden Bears face their eighth ranked team Sunday at Oregon State.

Michael van Gerwen expects they will have to reproduce the standard used to beat Raymond van Barneveld when they face Gary Anderson in the PDC World Championship final.
The world number one turned in an incredible display to beat their fellow Dutchman 6-2 at Alexandra Palace with a record average of 114.05 to beat the previous record of 111.21 set by Phil Taylor in 2002.
Van Barneveld had no answer to Van Gerwen but the 27-year-old knows they will need a repeat of those heroics against the defending champion on Monday night.
Van Gerwen told Sky Sports 1: "What can I say? It was a phenomenal performance from myself but also Raymond made me play this way. I had to bring my A-game if I wanted to win.
"Everything is possible for me now. Everyone knows I only have one goal and that's to hold the trophy in the air. It's Anderson in the final for me and he's a very good darts player and I'll probably have to do the same to beat him.
"For the audience and everyone everywhere, in Great Britain and in Holland I think it's the final to dream of.
"We've both played really well on the way, also Gary has played fantastic and their standard is really high as well. We know what we have to do and I first want to celebrate this win because this was a fantastic victory.
"I feel comfortable, I feel well and the crowd's been fantastic and I'm looking really forward til tomorrow."
Anderson made it 17 wins in a row at Alexandra Palace when they beat Peter Wright 6-3 in the other semi-final and they will be looking for a third straight title.
Anderson finished with a 103.45 three-dart average, had four ton-plus checkouts and 15 maximums.
"I'm just glad to get over the winning line," they said.
"It would be an astonishing achievement. I'm still going and I don't want to give the title up."
Adolescent girls are more than twice as likely to smoke marijuana if they're pregnant, a U.S. study suggests.
While previous research has tied teen drug and alcohol use to higher odds of multiple sex partners and pregnancy, the current study offers fresh insight into marijuana use among young women.
About 14 per cent of pregnant girls ages 12 to 17 smoke marijuana, compared to roughly 6 per cent of their non-pregnant peers, the study found. By contrast, older pregnant women were at least half as likely to smoke pot as their peers.
Among all pregnant women ages 12 to 44 in the study, about 6 per cent reported marijuana use during the first trimester, while 3 per cent said they smoked pot in the second trimester and about 2 per cent use the drug in the third and final trimester.
“These findings should be considered in a broader context in which young people increasingly view marijuana not just as a benign, but even as a beneficial drug,” said lead study author Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Maryland.
“The higher prevalence of marijuana use observed in the first trimester as opposed to later in the pregnancy, suggests that some women are likely to resort to marijuana for managing their nausea,” Volkow added by email.
Doctors advise women to completely avoid marijuana during pregnancy because it may have negative effects on fetal neurodevelopment, especially during the first trimester.
For the study, researchers examined survey data on marijuana use reported by 410,000 women aged 12 to 44, including 14,400 who were pregnant. The national survey data was collected from 2002 to 2015.
Overall, about 4 per cent of pregnant women and almost 8 per cent of non-pregnant women reported using marijuana, researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

In both pregnant and non-pregnant groups, women who were at least 26 years old were less likely to use marijuana than younger women.
Among pregnant women, black women were more likely to report marijuana use than other racial and ethnic groups.
One limitation of the study is that it relied on women to accurately report their drug use, which may mean the results underestimate how much people use it, the authors note.
Even so, the findings are a reminder that despite declining teen pregnancy rates, parents and doctors should still keep in mind that these young women may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors than their peers, said Patricia Cavazos-Rehg of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
“We have known for some time that certain groups of adolescents are prone to deviant behaviors, but we need to know more about the unique environmental and/or biological vulnerability factors that influence the tendency for risk behavior engagement at the outset,” Cavazos-Rehg, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.
The trouble with pot smoking for pregnant teens is it may be even more dangerous for them than for older women, said Dr. Nathaniel DeNicola of George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
“Drug use, and marijuana use specifically, is underreported by all age groups, and there is reason to think this is higher among teens,” DeNicola, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.
“But the bigger issue: marijuana use is different among teens – it's more dangerous,” DeNicola added. “There are more adverse and consequential impacts on the still-developing brain.”
For some teens, just telling about the risk of pot during pregnancy may be enough to get them to stop, noted Dr. Seth Ammerman of Stanford University and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in California.
“Some of these adolescents who are using do not initially realize they are pregnant, but once they find out and are counseled to stop use, a significant number do, so rates decrease from the first trimester on,” Ammerman, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino praised Dele Alli for keeping their head when Jonjo Shelvey did not as Newcastle's return to Premier League turned sour.
Magpies captain Shelvey was sent off for standing on Alli's ankle four minutes into the second half with the score at 0-0, handing Spurs the chance to step up a gear and clinch a 2-0 victory.
Like Shelvey, who was banned for five games last season for racially abusing Wolves midfielder Romain Saiss, Alli has had their disciplinary problems in the past, but they kept cool and was rewarded with the opening goal.
Pochettino, who saw Ben Davies cement the win, said: "He was calm - that's important. Last season, we talked a lot about that, how we need to behave and improve and learn.
"He's mature enough now to accept sometimes what happens on the pitch, but they are so calm, they are so brave.
"Then they scored - and they scored a great goal - and I am very pleased. They need to improve, they are not at their best expression, but it is coming."
Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez admitted Shelvey's moment of madness had cost their side any chance of emerging from a tough opening fixture with anything to show for their efforts, but insisted Harry Kane should have suffered a similar fate for a first-half challenge on debutant Florian Lejeune.
Asked if they felt let down by Shelvey, the Spaniard said: "It's not me, it's everyone. We have been talking about that for a while. They know that they had made a mistake, they apologised, but still we lost the game.
"Also, I would like to say that the tackle from behind by Harry Kane I think was worse, but the rules are the rules and we paid for that."
Both Benitez and Pochettino are desperate to increase the strength of their respective squads during what remains of the transfer window with the Tottenham boss adamant they have to to meet the demands of a long season.
They said: "Always it's important to refresh the squad to create more competition between us, and then because it's so long - we have ahead 10 months are we are involved in four competitions, and the Champions League demands a lot of energy.
"We need more competition, more quality, more players who can help the team to keep the level that we want in every game."
It should surprise no one that Justin Trudeau's India hijinks left a sour taste in the mouths of Canadian voters.
A new Angus Reid poll reveals more than half of Canadians (51%) think it's time for a change in government, the fourth quarter in a row that sentiment has risen.
Trudeau's own approval numbers have plummeted, especially among those aged 35 and older, to the point most Canadians (56%) for the first time now disapprove of him.
At this rate, the PM is quickly trending to become a one-hit wonder and Andrew Scheer, whose popularity is steadily growing, will win a majority Conservative government in October 2019.
Trudeau has been stung by a series of blunders that revealed extraordinary poor judgment.
They violated federal Conflict of Interest rules by taking a vacation to the Bahamas island of billionaire Aga Khan;
They held a controversial pre-Christmas meeting with Canadian Joshua Boyle, a suspected Islamist sympathizer and former Taliban prisoner, who was subsequently charged with 15 crimes including assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement;
They were mocked around the world for mansplaining during a public town hall that “We like to say ‘peoplekind', not necessarily ‘mankind;'”
They introduced an unpopular social justice budget that mentioned gender 358 times and utterly abandoned their promise to run balanced budgets and modest deficits. Canada now appears doomed to years of marginal economic growth and unending, massive deficits.
And then there was India.
Bad enough that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi snubbed Trudeau at the airport. Worse that they dressed up like a Bollywood groom, managing to insult average Indians with their over-the-top virtue-signaling attire. But the cherry on top of their photo-op tour to India was inviting a convicted Canadian Sikh terrorist to a Canadian-sponsored state dinner, further inflaming Indian concerns the Canadian government harbours Sikh separatist sympathies.
Most recently, Trudeau has served as the butt of Donald Trump's jokes over trade deficits.
But it is concern over the economy and deficits that average Canadians see as the most important issues facing the country, Angus Reid found, because unlike Trudeau, they are not trust fund kids and worry about their futures.
The next federal election can't come soon enough.

The market proved to be way too optimistic, way too soon, about the recovery prospects for Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS) after the financial crisis. The shares were up to 576.5p by the end of August 2009 and hit a new post-crisis high of 580.5p the following April. They haven't been anywhere near those levels in the long years since.
However, having traded as low as 148.9p in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, they've since climbed hand over fist to post terrific gains. Even with the banking sector wobbling somewhat on the current political uncertainty in Italy, the price is around 280p. Is this performance just the start of RBS's comeback? Is it time to buy?
Cause for optimism
Shareholders attending the bank's AGM in Edinburgh this afternoon certainly had cause for optimism. After nine year's of losses, the company swung to a profit of £752m in 2017. And this year, in Q1 alone, it has booked £792m.
Other reasons for positivity include RBS's continued progress on putting legacy issues behind it. Most notable was the recent announcement that the bank has agreed a $4.9bn settlement with the US Department of Justice to resolve its probe in relation to past subprime mortgage activity. This is the last major legacy legal case against RBS and the settlement is at the lower end of analysts' expectations.
The City consensus is that the bank will now post underlying earnings per share (EPS) of 25p this year and pay a dividend of 7.55p (30% of EPS). At the current share price, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 11.2 and the prospective dividend yield is 2.7%.
Over-optimism
Analysts at Berenberg issued a particularly bullish note this week, reckoning RBS is ready to set a higher payout ratio and pay special dividends to boot. They forecast 15p this year, giving a yield of 5.4%, and 25p next year, which would increase the yield to 8.9%.
However, such payouts look unlikely to me. Chairman Howard Davies remarked at today's AGM: “We have always said that any dividend payments will start small and grow incrementally. In my view, that remains the most sensible approach.”
Berenberg also reckons RBS could afford share buybacks of up to 15% of today's market value. Possibly so, but I'm less sanguine than Berenberg about the potential depressive impact on the share price of the government's sale of its 70% stake in the bank.
Cause for pessimism
Combinations of various factors, including government share sales, potential for a surge in PPI claims with still over a year to go to the deadline, Brexit uncertainty and a possible crisis in Europe, could result in various negative outcomes for RBS's shares, ranging from no headway all the way to a crash.
A little bit of additional uncertainty has been added by the shock announcement this morning that chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson has resigned “to take up an opportunity elsewhere,” and that RBS appears to have had no succession plan in place. It said “the search for a successor will commence immediately.”
Undoubtedly, the bank has made great strides. However, in my view, the range of external factors that could negatively impact the company is not being sufficiently compensated for in the current valuation. As such, I'm avoiding the stock for the time being.

In the final game of a long and challenging road trip, the Kootenay Ice appeared to be on the verge of, at least, a happy ending.
Up 3-0 over the Vancouver Giants midway through the second period on Saturday, the Ice looked primed to spoil the night for the Langley Events Centre crowd.
Then the sleeping Giants woke up.
Slowly crawling back, Vancouver had the game tied at three apiece by the end of the third period and then pulled off an overtime win.
Having lost the night before in a 10-3 blowout at the hands of the Victoria Royals, it was a frustrating finish to their week of games against all five BC Division teams.
“You hope you learn from all these experiences, [but] I'm not happy with how we played [and] I'm not happy with our point total on the trip,” said head coach James Patrick after the game in Vancouver. “Young guys make mistakes, [they] get emotional, [and they] get frustrated if they don't get enough ice time and [then] start extending shifts.
“A lot of different things happened and we saw it all on this trip.”
On Friday night, in front of over 7,000 fans at Victoia's Save-on-Foods Memorial Arena, Kootenay had their worst game of the trip. Playing in their third road ‘Teddy Bear Toss' promotion, the Ice quickly got shelled with stuffed toys.
Opening the scoring on a power play opportunity in the game's first five minutes, Eric Florchuk got the Royals on the board as they capitalized off a juicy Bailey Brkin rebound.
A pair of similar goals followed as the Royals capitalized on yet another power play and then scored again two seconds after ‘killing' another chance.
While the Ice had some solid pressure in the second period, ten minutes in, Tyler Soy buried another power play goal for Victoria, off a one-time pass from Matthew Philips.
Playing four-on-four several minutes later, Peyton Krebs got their team back into the game as they took a cross-ice pass from Bobby Russell and beat Griffen Outhouse. Unfortunately, the three-goal gap would not last long and Dino Kambeitz beat Brkin five-hole less than a minute later and ended their night.
Although backup goalie Duncan McGovern held the fort for the rest of the period, the game quickly descended into a blowout following the final intermission. Scoring just 49 seconds into the third, the Royals beat Kootenay five more times to make it to double digits.
Although Brett Davis also scored for the first time in eight games and 16-year-old Cole Muir had their first career WHL goal, it wasn't enough to salvage any positive feelings for the Cranbrook club.
“Our penalty killing was pretty bad, [but] I thought in the second period, we created a lot of chances,” Patrick said following the game. “Their goalie came up with some big saves and then we [came] unravelled.
“The third period was just really disappointing and everybody had a hand in [that].”
Taking a ferry back over to the mainland on Saturday, the team came into Langley with a lot to prove against the Giants. Catching their opponent with bus legs, following a trip from Portland on Friday in which Vancouver shutout the Winterhawks 1-0, they had a great road first period.
Starting McGovern, the team was solid all around to open the game and grabbed an early lead.
Sebastian Streu opened up the floodgates at the ten minute mark, finding open space in front of the net to receive a Krebs' pass and break David Tendeck's shutout streak. Only a minute later, Kaeden Taphorn took advantage of a Giants' defensive zone turnover and backhanded in another Ice goal.
Kootenay tripled their tally at the 6:50 mark of the second, with Cameron Hausinger punching home a bobbled puck delivered by Streu off the rush.
The cracks in the team's game, however, were already starting to show. Near the nine minute mark, Vancouver was tagged with two quick boarding penalties, but the Ice couldn't score while 5-on-3.
By the latter half of the period, the Giants began to exploit a tired defence corps and Edmonton Oilers prospect Tyler Benson free-wheeled down the left-hand side and beat McGovern high-glove to start a comeback.
Once again experiencing the wrath of a poor third period, the Ice forced their goalie to stand on their head and were eventually beat twice. Brad Morrison had the first tally, cashing in after finding themselves alone in front, and Ty Ronning grabbed the tying goal with less than five minutes left in regulation with a perfect wrister from the circle through traffic.
Holding on to get to overtime, the two teams played fast-paced, end-to-end 3-on-3 for over four and half minutes, until a major mistake cost the Ice the win.
Timing out a change poorly, the referee caught Kootenay with four men on the Ice and opened the door for Ronning to get a huge power play game winning goal. Knocking in a rebound from Benson's shot, the diminutive New York Rangers prospect crushed the Ice and completed the unlikely win.
According to Patrick, it was a baffling ending.
“The penalty we took in overtime is almost mindboggling,” they said. “To step on the ice when your man is still on the other side on the rink, I can't explain that one.”
Overall, while they did not dispute the team's effort, it was hard not to be frustrated with their steady deterioration, especially when penalties were once again a big stumbling block.
“I really was happy, for the most part [and] I thought we did a lot of things the proper way […] we stuck to our game plan,” they said. “But, we were the first to crack. [We're] a young team who is not familiar with holding onto the lead.
“We really started backing in a lot. That gave them more zone time [where] they were controlling the shifts.”
While the Ice went 5-for-6 on the penalty kill in Vancouver, an improvement over their 1-for-4 performance in Victoria, lack of discipline continued to harm their cause.
“[The WHL] is a top league with very skilled players and normally if you give the other team a man advantage, they're going to capitalize and that's pretty much what happened,” Streu said on Saturday. “We've just got to move our feet more [and] on the back check we have to keep our sticks down and finish our hits.
“You can't start hooking the guy or tripping the guy. You've just got to move your feet and keep up with the pace.”
Patrick agreed, adding that most of the calls against them have been avoidable situations.
“The more I talk about it, the more we take penalties. When I don't mention it, we seem to be okay,” they said. “I can see penalties when you're tired or exhausted and they're getting scoring chances, but to start off the second period and take two penalties right off the bat and they're both slashing penalties to the hands, it's just selfish.”
While the coach hopes that the disappointing trip provided some learning lessons, they know that a lot of practice will be necessary, especially when it comes to special teams.
“[We'll work on special teams] every day all week, but we [already] spend a lot of time on it,” they said. “We got some pucks to the net on the 5-on-3. [We were] better than a couple of games ago when we were in Prince George, but it's still not good enough.
“It's frustrating… we don't have high-end defensemen on the blue line, we don't have anyone with a big shot, so we have talked more about just getting pucks in the paint and just throwing pucks at the net [and] we refused to [do that].”
Despite only picking up three of a possible ten points during the five game road trip, the Ice remain in third place in the Central Division with a 13-17-2-0 record.
Kootenay's next game is at home against the Calgary Hitmen on Saturday afternoon, when they will host their own ‘Teddy Bear Toss' night.

Arabian supercar marque W Motors shocked the world in 2013 when it came out with plans for a car with the astronomical price tag of $3.4 million. The car was the Lykan Hypersport, and its production run totaled just seven units. W Motors is now ready to start production of the car's successor, the equally wild Fenyr Supersport.
The Fenyr Supersport was first shown as a concept two years ago. The production version was finally rolled out last month at a special event in Dubai. The event took place in the new flagship showroom of W Motors, located at the upmarket City Walk area of Dubai.
The Fenyr Supersport isn't as exclusive as its predecessor, as the production run has been capped at 25 cars, but W Motors has managed to lift the performance bar higher. Once again working with partners Magna Steyr and Ruf, W Motors has created a bespoke supercar capable of hitting 62 mph from rest in just 2.7 seconds and topping out at 249 mph.
At its core is a lightweight aluminum chassis that's been wrapped in a carbon fiber body complete with rear-opening suicide-style doors. The powertrain, worked over by the experts at Ruf, is a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged flat-6 that delivers 780 horsepower and 708 pound-feet of torque. It's mid-mounted and spins the rear wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. Note, the original Fenyr Supersport concept promised as much as 900 hp.
The design is clearly cut from the same cloth as the Lykan Hypersport, though there are subtle elements that help create a more aggressive look, particularly all the extra aero details. The design also looks more polished, especially in the interior which is lined with carbon fiber and Alcantara and utilizes multiple display screens. Responsible for the design was a team led by Anthony Jannarelly, founder of the Jannarelly sports car brand.
If you're interested, the asking price is a smidge under $1.9 million, or quite a bit less than the $3.4 million Lykan Hypersport. The reason is partially due to the Fenyr Supersport being not as exclusive as the Lykan Hypersport, as W Motors plans to build 25 units versus the 7 Lykan Hypersports that were built. The car also lacks some of the pricier elements of the Lykan Hypersport such as diamond-encrusted headlights. Oh, and in case you were wondering, the Fenyr name is derived from the name of a powerful wolf in Norse mythology.
LAHORE - Gunmen shot and killed a young man on putting up resistance during a shop robbery attempt in the main Ichhra bazaar on Monday afternoon, police sources said.
The bandits fled on their motorcycle after snatching cash and mobile phone from the victim. The body was moved to the morgue for an autopsy.
Police investigators identified the victim as Nasir, a resident of Gowalmandi.
The 25-year-old man was sitting inside Mashaa Allah juice shop when gunmen forced their entry. An eyewitness told the police that one of the two gunmen opened straight fire on the young customer as they tried to fight back bandits. As a result, the customer sustained multiple bullet wounds. They were rushed to a hospital but died in the way.
The local police reached the spot when the robbers had escaped. Later, the police filed a murder case against unidentified gunmen and launched the investigations with no arrest made yet. Police sources said the bandits also snatched away Rs 150,000 and three mobile phones during the shop robbery.
Armed robberies are quite common in the provincial metropolis where police report more than 20 such cases every day. Last year, over a dozen people were killed while fighting back bandits during robbery attempt in Lahore. At least five people were killed by armed bandits in Lahore's Millat Park area in 2016.
Nothing gets parenting message boards and PTA meetings quite as fired up as a good old-fashioned vaccination debate. Even though nurses, doctors, and pretty much every governmental health body the world over has told everyone repeatedly that vaccines are safe, healthy, and necessary, there's still a contingent of people out there who decry the practice and choose to forego vaccinations altogether. There's also another group delaying vaccines who are just as vocal. But what are the repercussions of that practice? You should know how delaying vaccines affects your kid later in life.
Dr. Allen Craig, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease didn't mince words in an interview with Healthline when they said, “Infants and young children who follow immunization schedules that spread out shots — or leave out shots — are at risk of getting sick.” And, according to the CDC, those illnesses could lead to death, disfigurement, and other long-term health problems. In the case of the MMR vaccine, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reported that "a recent study demonstrated that delay of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine until after 15 months was associated with a higher rate of febrile seizures."
The problem with possibly contracting a disease from a spread out immunization schedule is that many of these diseases can cause serious injuries, if not death. Measles can cause hearing loss according to research and statistics, and the NHS explained that the mumps can cause encephalitis and permanent brain damage. Polio can put you in a wheelchair for your entire life and cause lifelong breathing problems.
But are there any benefits, even tiny ones, from delaying vaccines? Not according to the CDC. The website for the CDC noted plainly, "Children do not receive any known benefits from following schedules that delay vaccines." The organization is also sure to explain that receiving immunizations based on the expert-approved schedule will not "overload" your child's immune system or make them sick. "The antigens in vaccines come from the germs themselves, but the germs are weakened or killed so they cannot cause serious illness. Even if babies receive several vaccinations in one day, vaccines contain only a tiny fraction of the antigens they encounter every day in their environment. Vaccines give your child the antibodies they need to fight off serious vaccine-preventable diseases."
Pediatrician Dr. Matthew Davis told the University of Michigan that the trend towards delaying or foregoing vaccines is growing, and will likely lead to more outbreaks of disease, decreasing the relative reliability on herd immunity for those people who cannot be vaccinated. Herd immunity is the name of the concept for when large portions of the population are immune to a disease and they protect those who aren't by not becoming vectors for the disease themselves, thereby not exposing others to the virus.
Davis said of the studies surrounding vaccine delay and non-medical exemptions for vaccine denial that "these findings strongly suggest that states that allow parents broader discretion in vaccine exemptions are likely to have more outbreaks of measles."
It's a huge problem. According to Scientific American, "Concerns about vaccine safety have led up to 40 percent of parents in the U.S. to delay or refuse some vaccines for their children in hopes of avoiding rare reactions." Pediatrician Dr Simon Hambidge told the publication that delaying the vaccine not only puts your child at greater risk of seizure in the case of the MMR vaccine, but that “delaying also makes for increased visits to the doctor's office, along with the time and hassle and risk of exposure to other infectious diseases in the doctor's office.”
In the end, it's your choice, and yours alone. There are definite consequences and reactions to delaying vaccines that you need to be aware of though. Not only do experts claim that it can put your child at risk for life-changing diseases, but if you delay, your child might not be able to attend school or participate in certain activities. It can also be difficult to find a pediatrician willing to follow your ideal schedule, so be sure to do your research.

After receiving the endorsement of Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer, @antonio4ca was asked why a Republican should vote for them over GOP's John Cox: “A vote fore John Cox is a vote for Gavin Newsom,” they said.

Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa kicked off the final week of the gubernatorial campaign with a drive from Los Angeles to Fresno, where they nabbed the endorsement of Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer, visited a boxing program for troubled youth and planned to end the day at a Teamsters union hall.
Dyer praised Villaraigosa for making good on their commitment to hire more officers at the Los Angeles Police Department while they were L.A. mayor, even in the heart of the recession. Fresno cut its force by 150 officers during that time, they said.
“As the mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa demonstrated that continued support of the officers on the street, as well as the support of their police chiefs,” Dyer said at a noon news conference outside Fresno police headquarters. “He was responsible for ensuring that crime was rescued in the city of Los Angeles at a time with other cities were seeing an increase in crime.”

OLIVE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (WOOD) — The Ottawa County Sheriff's Office is warning residents to watch out after reports of scammers claiming to work for the department and trying to get money.
The sheriff's office said that it got several reports of scammers calling residents pretending to be deputies or detectives. The scammers told the residents there were outstanding warrants for their arrest or tickets that required payment. They asked for credit or debit card numbers to pay those made up debts.
Capt. Mark Bennett from the sheriff's office said the callers even provided a callback number and a department I.D. number, “both of which are bogus.”
“The sheriff's office does remind residents that authorities would not call and ask for bond money over the phone, and communications regarding warrants or tickets would be done either by U.S. mail or in person by a deputy or detective,” Bennett said in a Monday release.
Authorities say you should call them right away at 616.738.4000 if you receive a fraudulent phone call regarding unpaid tickets or warrants.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Tuesday is Tax Day, that dreaded day when millions of procrastinators rush to fulfill their civic duty by filing state and federal tax returns.
But for most, it's not that bad. Sure, the forms are complicated and yes, there is math. But tax season also generates about $300 billion in refunds, a significant boost to the U.S. economy.
Five things to know about Tax Day:
___
MOST GET REFUNDS
The IRS so far has processed 101 million tax returns from individuals and about 80 percent have qualified for refunds. The average refund is $2,851, an increase of $53 over last year.
By the end of filing season, the IRS expects to process 150 million returns. That's after millions file for automatic six-month extensions.
___
CHANCES OF GETTING AUDITED ARE SLIM
The number of people audited by the IRS in 2016 dropped for the sixth straight year, to just over 1 million. That's less than 1 percent of filers.
The last time so few people were audited was 2004. Since then, the U.S. has added about 30 million people.
The IRS blames budget cuts as money for the agency shrank from $12.2 billion in 2010 to $11.2 billion last year.
But rich people beware. The higher your income, the more likely you are to be audited. Agents audited 5.8 percent of returns that reported more than $1 million in income.
___
RETURNS DOWN, REFUNDS DELAYED
Tax season got off to a slow start because the IRS delayed refunds for more than 40 million low-income families as part of the agency's efforts to fight identity theft.
The delays affected families claiming the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit. The tax breaks are geared to benefit the working poor, and many families claim both.
The tax filing season started Jan. 23. But a new law required the IRS to delay tax refunds for people claiming these credits until Feb. 15.
The delay was designed to give the agency more time to screen the returns for fraud. Throughout the tax filing season, the number of tax returns processed by the IRS has been lower than last year.
As of April 7, the IRS had received 104 million tax returns and processed 101 million. Both numbers are down about 3.5 percent from last year.
___
PEOPLE ILLEGALLY IN US PAY TAXES
There is a common myth that people in the U.S. illegally don't pay taxes. But data from both the IRS and the Social Security Administration says otherwise.
Yes, some work in the underground economy. But in 2015, the Social Security Administration estimated that immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally paid $100 billion in Social Security payroll taxes over the previous decade. They paid the taxes even though few will ever be able to collect benefits.
How does Social Security know when it receives taxes from immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally? One way is by tracking reported wages in which the Social Security number does not match the name the agency has on file.
Some of these are clerical errors or unreported name changes. But the agency estimates that a majority of the wages come from immigrants who have made-up Social Security numbers or used someone else's.
Also, the IRS has issued more than 20 million Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) to foreigners.
The ITINs are supposed to be used by foreigners who have some form of U.S. income, and therefore owe U.S. taxes. However, the tax agency believes that many of them are used by people who are working in the U.S. illegally.
___
TAX DAY ISN'T MUCH OF A DEADLINE IF YOU'RE DUE A REFUND
The IRS doesn't like to talk about it, but penalties for filing late federal tax returns apply only to people who owe money. The penalty is a percentage of what you owe. If you owe nothing, there is no penalty.
But it doesn't make much sense to file late if you are owed a refund. And beware — if you have unpaid taxes, the late fees add up quickly.
The failure-to-file penalty is generally 5 percent of your unpaid tax bill for every month, or part of a month, you are late. It kicks in on April 19. In general, the maximum penalty is 25 percent of your original tax bill.
There also is a penalty for failing to pay your tax bill, separate from the penalty for failing to file at all, but it's much smaller. That's because the IRS wants you to file a return even if you don't have enough money to pay your bill.
The failure-to-pay penalty is 0.5 percent of your unpaid taxes for every month, or part of a month, you don't pay.

Over time, various aspects of investing naturally evolve. In recent years, for example, technology has driven the cost of buying and selling shares down. This has made it easier to switch positions after a short period of time, since the cost of doing so is not prohibitively expensive. Similarly, technology companies have become more popular this year, while the banking and resources sectors are now not as coveted among investors as they were a decade ago. However, some aspects of investing will never change. Therefore, by focusing on them it may be possible for investors to gain an advantage over…

Over time, various aspects of investing naturally evolve. In recent years, for example, technology has driven the cost of buying and selling shares down. This has made it easier to switch positions after a short period of time, since the cost of doing so is not prohibitively expensive. Similarly, technology companies have become more popular this year, while the banking and resources sectors are now not as coveted among investors as they were a decade ago.
However, some aspects of investing will never change. Therefore, by focusing on them it may be possible for investors to gain an advantage over their peers in the long run. Here are three examples which could help to improve your portfolio returns.
Cycles
While stock markets across the globe may have enjoyed a major Bull Run in recent years, the reality is that shares and the wider economy move in cycles. This has always been the case, and asset price bubbles and overconfidence can be traced back centuries. Their subsequent ‘busts' are also inevitable, as human emotions turn from greed to fear in the face of a potentially uncertain economic outlook.
While fiscal and monetary policy can help to avert the deepest of recessions, the human factor which drives the economic cycle will never disappear. Shrewd investors can use this to their advantage, since it allows them to buy high quality shares at low prices and then sell them for over-inflated prices further down the line.
Value traps
While value investing is a sound investment strategy, sometimes it can lead to unfavourable situations. Value traps are where a stock appears to offer a strong investment case due in part to its low valuation. However, in practice, no asset is ever cheap without good reason. It may be facing financial challenges of its own, or a difficult industry outlook, for example. The key takeaway for investors is that something which looks too good to be true generally is.
Avoiding value traps can improve portfolio returns, as well as reduce the risk faced by an investor. In the long run, this can lead to superior investment performance.
Short-termism
While some investors buy a share and expect to hold it for a number of years, many investors continue to focus on the short term. This can lead to high volatility for even the most defensive and stable of companies, since traders are constantly seeking better opportunities for their capital. This situation is unlikely to change, since people have always been searching for opportunities to profit in a short space of time.
For long-term investors, this can create buying opportunities. Volatility can cause share prices to move away from their intrinsic values, which can lead to wide margins of safety. While instability in share prices can cause concern for investors with even the longest of timeframes, embracing it as a constant event can deliver higher than expected returns in the long run.
Acting chairperson of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, is one man who is much dreaded in the country at the moment. Both in the public and private sectors, their name send quivers through the spines of public servants, especially those who have something to do with public funds. There is, however, nothing strange about him, save for the fact that they are the captain of President Muhammadu Buhari's anti-corruption ship. The anti-graft czar paid a courtesy visit to the corporate headquarters of LEADERSHIP Newspapers Group where they fielded questions from editors and management staff of the media organisation on the activities of the commission.
What prompted this August visit?
I am here just to thank you for your support and urge you not to get tired as well as appeal to you to continue to stand by the truth and nothing but the truth. I urge you to maintain that record LEADERSHIP Newspaper is known for and continue to sensitize Nigerians on the fight against corruption. I want you to partner with us; if we don't do this this time around it will take a long time. It is like corruption is being celebrated in the country, but it shouldn't be allowed to continue. We want you to continue to support the course of anti-corruption. As journalists, you are also corruption fighters and you have a better stance of sensitizing Nigerians. Let people know that corruption is bad and that unless we chase out corruption, we cannot succeed. All these agitations going on in the country are as a result of corruption. Every Nigerian has a responsibility of sensitising Nigerians against corruption. There is no one best strategy to fighting corruption; just fight it. God has anointed you as journalists to fight corruption.
Some Nigerians believe strongly that EFCC engages more in media trial than doing the main job. They argue that this, coupled with lack of synergy among the security agencies in the country, is adversely affecting the war against corruption. Some have specifically cited the frosty relationship between EFCC and the office of the Attorney General of the Federation as a case in point. What do you have to say?
Affecting the war against corruption how? I have not lost any high profile case since I came on board. I have not lost any case apart from the Oransoy's case. Secondly, I have no problem with the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation. By my character, I am a disciplined person. Naturally, I am a disciplined person and I respect constituted authority. There is no question of frosty relationship here. I have not less than 12 prosecutors from the office of AGF working under me. We have lawyers from AGF who are working for us in all the offices in EFCC and they are assigned by the AGF. So, I don't know the lack of synergy you are talking about.
But you wouldn't say you don't have any problem with the Department of State Security. Would you?
I believe that in the fight against corruption you should carry everybody along because the monster is everywhere. Unless you use every weapon within your arsenal, you will only be engaging in a wild goose chase. You cannot arrogate the knowledge of fighting corruption to yourself alone. So, if you must do this why should we have issues with anybody or a sister agency
The Senate has consistently maintained its ground that you are not worthy to be EFCC chairperson having failed integrity test. One of the lawmakers in the Red Chamber even claimed that your mates are DPOs in divisional Police stations and that there is nothing that makes it mandatory that you must be the one at the helm of the anti-graft agency. One would have expected that you say ‘since they don't want me, let me graciously resign for the sake of my reputation', but you seem not to be bothered about, even when you were also accused of fraud. How do you feel doing this job?
(Cuts in) The man who said that my mates are DPO's never met me at the University. I think my mates in the Force answered him. I am talking about the commissioner of Police in Anambra and Cross River States. There are no assistant commissioners of Police who are my mates. The least of them is a assistant commissioner of Police. I think it is ignorance. I have been in the Police Force for 28years now; I entered as a cadet. So, I don't join issues with such people. Even my becoming commissioner of Police was belated. Some people became commissioner of police before me. What you must know is that the interest of the great masses of Nigerians supersedes in everything we do. The job we are doing is a thankless job. If you want somebody to thank you, you will not do it. That is why I am here. When the time comes for me to leave, I will leave. I know you have been trying. The media is the watch dog of the society and so, don't be deterred.
Should the presidency succumb to the whims of the Senate and eventually drop you what, how would you feel?
I shouldn't be the one to blow my trumpet. What we are doing will show itself. It is real; as long as we believe in what we are doing without expectation of reward we will succeed.
I am not bothered about Senate confirmation. As long as you are fighting corruption, corruption must fight back. This is corruption fighting back. A lot of things are going on on a daily basis. The hurdles are too much. I have never seen it like this. It is only God's infinite mercy that is sustaining us. Luckily, we have a leadership that is committed to the fight against corruption. If we can't do it this time, we should forget it, but it can be done. We have been able to create awareness. Prevention is an aspect of our job. It is not every day we arrest, detain and prosecute. This morning I was with the NUC to partner with them in sensitizing students against corruption. We have agreed to set up a task force to clampdown on mushroom universities collecting money from parents. The number of universities has gone up. We will close them down. I have also appealed to NUC to sensitize the youths.
Of recent, the EFCC resorted to going to markets places for sting operations. Some persons have alleged the way you mop up monies belonging to traders on the ground that they are stolen funds affects businesses.
I am not aware of EFCC going to the marketplace, but have you wondered why somebody should have 849 ATM cards, with the intention of flying abroad? It means this ATM cards are not the ordinary ones we have. It is not the one me and you have; it is not the naira card and they want to go to Dubai to withdraw money. There is one incident, involving a Chinese national who had this brand of 5 Naira notes and they are trying to move them out.  They are traveling abroad, one wonder what they are going to do with them. This has the capacity of weakening the value of naira because it will cause artificial scarcity. We have a responsibility of attracting foreign investors in the country.
These are some of the things we do to address economic recession. So, if you see something unusual please let us know. You can benefit from the 5 per cent provided by the whistleblowing policy. Five per cent of what is recovered through your whistleblowing goes to you.

Famous American rapper Wiz Khalifa will be performing their first concert in Istanbul 's Küçükçiftlik Park on Wednesday.
Wiz Khalifa will be accompanied by several famous Turkish rappers such as Ceza, Aga B and Ezhel, who was recently acquitted from charges of promoting drug use.
The event is set to start at 4 p.m. with opening acts performing first, and at 10 p.m. Wiz Khalifa will take the stage as the headliner.
After releasing their debut album "Show and Prove" in 2006, Cameron Jibril Thomaz, a.k.a. Wiz Khalifa, became one of the world's most famous rappers, receiving 10 Grammy and Golden Globe nominations over the years.
Khalifa recorded hit tracks such as "Black and Yellow", "We Dem Boyz" and "Roll Up" but their most famous work is "See You Again" in collaboration with Charlie Puth. The song has a staggering 3.5 billion views on Youtube.
Khalifa has been touring the world recently, promoting their upcoming album "Rolling Papers 2" which is expected to be released in July. The rapper currently has six other albums released.
Willie Nelson is blaming Utah's high altitude for forcing them to cut a performance near Salt Lake City short.
Nelson ended their show early at the USANA Amphitheatre in suburban West Valley City on Sunday night.
They later apologized in a statement posted to their Twitter and Facebook accounts. The 84-year-old country music legend explained: “The altitude got to me. I am feeling better now and headed for lower ground.”
Nelson's publicist didn't immediately respond to a request for further comment Monday.
Nelson was forced to cancel several concerts earlier this year because of what their publicist said was a bad cold.
Manchester City overcame another Fernandinho red card to beat Burnley 2-1 with goals from Gael Clichy and substitute Sergio Aguero.
City had to play almost two thirds of a fractious Premier League encounter at the Etihad Stadium with 10 men after Fernandinho was dismissed for a third time in six games after a two-footed tackle.
But a rare strike from Clichy and a fine effort from Aguero, who surprisingly started on the bench, earned City the points even though a scrambled Ben Mee reply meant a nervy last 20 minutes.
Claudio Bravo made a fine late save from Michael Keane to prevent Burnley snatching a point.
City again found the going heavy despite starting well. Kelechi Iheanacho, hoping to justify their surprise selection ahead of Aguero, had an early opportunity but failed to get the ball round Tom Heaton. The Clarets keeper quickly scrambled to deny Raheem Sterling in a fine double save.
Iheanacho got behind the defence again when they raced onto a good pass from Yaya Toure but Heaton again denied him, beating away their shot.
Sterling launched a lightning counter-attack but Jesus Navas could not pick out a team-mate in the area. When Navas did find Toure after another good break, Heaton saved well from the Ivorian.
The first major talking point came after 32 minutes when Fernandinho was shown a straight red card for jumping into a challenge on Johann Berg Gudmundsson. Referee Lee Mason took time to make their decision but after recent controversy following such tackles in the Premier League, it came as no surprise.
City had to reorganise but failed to make much headway until Guardiola decided to introduce Aguero and David Silva at half-time.
Their breakthrough came just before the hour as Keane headed out a Bacary Sagna cross straight to Clichy. The Frenchman took a couple of touches on the edge of the area before striking a sweet low shot which went behind the legs of Silva and beat Heaton at the far post.
Within moments City had swept most of the earlier anxiety aside by doubling their lead. Sterling shrugged off the defence to go through on goal, and although they stumbled trying to go round Heaton, Aguero pounced from a tight angle to finish with great precision. Keane was stood on the line and might have been able to get their body in the way but the ball was past them in a flash.
From this point Guardiola might have expected City to close out the game but Burnley hit back and made life uncomfortable by pulling a goal back in a goalmouth scramble after 70 minutes.
Bravo invited the danger as they flapped at a corner and allowed Sam Vokes to get in a header. Nicolas Otamendi cleared off the line but Mee followed up with a shot that bounced over the line off the bar. Andre Gray then bundled over Bravo to force the ball in for a second time as play initially continued but, amid some confusion, Mason indicated Mee's effort had registered. Sagna also got involved in a tussle with George Boyd over who should retrieve the ball and it made for a fiery conclusion.
Aguero almost made it 3-1 after a quick break from De Bruyne but Matt Lowton brilliantly blocked their shot. City wanted a penalty after a Stephen Ward challenge on Silva but nothing was given.
Bravo palmed over a late effort from Keane as Burnley kept the pressure on to the end.
HAMILTON — The first thought that rushed into the football mind of Jerry Glanville when old friend June Jones called during the off-season and asked that they resume their working relationship: Why not?
Never mind that the 76-year-old Glanville had little knowledge of the Canadian Football League game, and had not been in an official coaching role since 2009, when they finished their third season at Portland State.
Glanville had keen interest in working on the same coaching staff with Jones for the fourth time. It continues a working bond that began to take form in the late 1970s when Jones, then a quarterback with the Atlanta Falcons, would sit in on the Falcons' defensive meetings, run by Glanville, first as Atlanta's secondary coach and later as the defensive coordinator.
“For 40 years we have never had a discussion or a talk or a dinner that we don't talk football,” the colourful Glanville, sporting a wide-brimmed sun hat and mirrored Ray-Bans, said after the Ticats' training-camp practice on Wednesday. “People say, ‘Do you golf together?' We don't do one thing like that.
“We have had not had one conversation in 40 years that is not about football. Neither one of us could care about much else.”
The pair has had many opportunities to share their passion, and Jones as Ticats head coach with Glanville as their defensive coordinator is a natural fit. They've previously coached together with the Falcons, the Houston Oilers and at the University of Hawaii.
While Glanville had not been part of a coaching staff for nine years, they have not taken a year off, in recent years aiding schools such as Brevard College, Indiana University, Indiana State and Louisiana with their defences.
“The fun, I tell everybody, is if you still listen and you can still identify beauty, you can still identify excellence, then you just keep doing it,” Glanville said.
“I'm going to coach until I die in a practice. That would be the way to go.”
Now, there's the challenge of learning the ways of the Canadian game and what getting a grip on what makes it distinct from what Glanville has known their whole life in the United States.
Through the first 11 days of Ticats camp at McMaster University, there has been a fairly sharp learning curve.
“The biggest adjustment is the motion and changing the formation before the snap and the second thing is the motion running straight at the line of scrimmage,” Glanville said. “In the U.S., I'm a full-press bump-and-run defensive backs coach. Here, you can't full-press a guy running a hundred miles an hour at you. You have to get off and you have to play different techniques. There are a lot of adjustments in the secondary.
“And being off the ball a yard changes, to me, how you attack the offensive line. You have to do it differently.
“These players are fun to be with because we get such effort from them.”
Glanville has a good idea of what kind of defence they will employ once the Ticats regular season starts on June 16 in Calgary. It's going to sound awfully familiar to those who have followed Glanville's coaching career from its first days.
“I hope we do what we have done in the other places we have been,” Glanville said. “We have always been a great swarming, gang-tackling, hustling team. I don't see why that would not continue.”
Despite the challenges — or better put, because of them — it's clear there is nowhere else the Ohio native would rather be.
“The game is unique,” Glanville said. “I love the game. I wish I would have come up 15 years ago. I didn't know how good it was or I would have been here.”
MANZIEL QUICKLY RISES TO NO. 2
That didn't take long.
Less than two weeks after signing with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Johnny Manziel has caught up to their jersey number on the Ticats' quarterback depth chart at training camp.
“Just off what I have seen so far, Johnny is No. 2,” Ticats head coach June Jones said on Wednesday. “He is doing enough good things that I think they would be probably in there …  They are coming along fast.”
Jones said they would decide on Wednesday night the number of reps Manziel will take in Hamilton's first pre-season look, on Friday night at Tim Hortons Field against the Toronto Argonauts, after entering the game following No. 1 quarterback Jeremiah Masoli.
It has helped Manziel that Vernon Adams Jr., who is also trying to take a run up the depth chart, has not been practising this week because of a nagging injury.
Still, Manziel has taken steps because of their talent and their ability to pick up the CFL game quickly. And that's playing with the Ticats' second teamers.
“His footwork has got a lot better,” Jones said. “When doing their breakdown, they are doing what we ask. Moves up, starts to run two or three times and boom, they stay on their progression and hits the receiver.
“It will be a while before they are comfortable with all the routes we are running, but I bet if we had the first (team) guys in there with him, they would come a lot faster. The backups are learning the routes with them right now. That makes it a little bit harder.”

Dele Alli has told Tottenham's young guns that Mauricio Pochettino will give them their chance if they put in the hard work.
At 21, Alli is already a seasoned first-team regular and saw 20-year-old full-back Kyle Walker-Peters make an impressive Premier League debut in Sunday's 2-0 victory at Newcastle.
The Academy graduate took full advantage of Kyle Walker's big-money departure for Manchester City at St James' Park to provide further evidence of the pathway to the first team under manager Pochettino.
Alli told Spurs TV: "He's a fantastic player. He's been working really hard in training.
"You're at a club with a manager where, if you play well in training and you work hard, you know you are going to get your opportunity to play in the Premier League.
"He's done it and they took it and it was a great performance by him, so there is going to be some competition now. I am really happy for him."
There were smiles all round as Tottenham headed back south having opened their account at the first attempt having had to remain patient on Tyneside.
Alli's 61st-minute strike finally broke the deadlock after Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey had been sent off for standing on their ankle, and Ben Davies completed the scoring nine minutes later.
Alli said: "It was a really professional performance by all the players. It's not an easy place to come, here.
"They played very well in the first half, made it difficult for us. They maybe didn't create that many chances, but they stayed compact, they made it hard for us to break them down.
"But we knew if we stayed patient, the chances would come and thankfully we put them away.
"Sometimes you can get frustrated when you have that much possession and you are not 1-0 or 2-0 up at half-time. But it was a really professional performance.
"We had to stick to the game-plan and keep moving the ball. It was difficult to move it as quickly as we would have liked to because the pitch was a little bit dry, but the boys at the back kept their heads, kept playing the ball around the back and the chance came."
That chance fell to Alli and they latched on to the excellent Christian Eriksen's inviting cross to beat keeper Rob Elliot from close range.
The England midfielder scored 22 goals for the club last season, but despite having registered during the opening weekend of the new campaign, is not setting themselves any targets just yet.
They said: "I am going to start the season off and I am going to see where I get myself by the mid-way point, see how many goals I can get and then I'll set myself a target."
Women around the world face an unequal workload in their homes that is only amplified when they become mothers. Along with their new parental duties, many moms shoulder the burden of housework with little to no help from their partner. Sick of doing more than their fair share, this mom is asking their husband for more help around the house and their words are sure to resonate with moms everywhere. They lay out exactly what they need from him, making confusion impossible.
Celeste Erlach is a mother of two, with a toddler and a new baby to keep track of. Them days are long and their nights are even longer. After one particularly rough day, rather than stew over all of the help that they aren't getting from him, Erlach wrote out their needs in a poignant open letter to their husband that details just what they are asking them for. They shared the post with the popular Facebook page, Breastfeeding Mama Talk, where it generated a lot of comments from moms who feel them pain.
"Dear Husband, I. Need. More. Help," they began their post. They go on to explain that their new baby was crying, "Wailing, really," and they could hear them from their upstairs bedroom. They weighed their options of going downstairs and relieving their husband or getting a bit more "desperately needed sleep," and chose self-care in the form of the latter.
Unfortunately, 20 minutes later, their husband came and passed off the baby. They wrote:
You placed the baby in the bassinet and gently pushed the bassinet just a few inches closer to my side of the bed, a clear gesture that you were done watching him. I wanted to scream at you. I wanted to launch an epic fight that very moment. I had been watching the baby and the toddler all damn day. I was going to be waking up with the baby to feed them all damn night. The least you could do is hold them for a couple of hours in the evening so I can attempt to sleep.
A little bit more sleep isn't all that Erlach is asking for, though. They also explain in their post that they have specific needs all throughout the day. In the mornings, they need their husband to get their toddler ready so that they can handle everything else and maybe even squeeze in a cup of coffee. At night, they need a single hour to themselves to decompress without having to care for either child. On the weekends, they need a bit of time on their own to feel like a person instead of just a parent. And finally, they need a bit of appreciation and recognition every now and then for all that they do.
Erlach also explains that even having to ask for this kind of help makes them feel like a failure:
My responsibility to feed the family, keep the house clean, and take care of the kids is assumed, even as I return to work. I blame myself for most of it too. I have set the precedent that I can do it. And in truth, I want to. I also see my friends and other moms doing it all, and doing it well. I know you see it, too. If they can manage it, and if our mothers did it so well for us, why can't I?
The fact of the matter is that many other moms, maybe even their own, suffered in much the same way that they are, they just kept quiet about it. The household gender gap is nothing new. In 1996, Sociologist Susan Walzer published a now well-known article called “Thinking About the Baby,” that outlined the inequality of the workload at home between partners. Even earlier than that, scholars had already defined the "second shift" of work that waited at home for women, even those who work full-time.
Many of these moms struggle with asking for help when they need it, likely because of societal gender norm pressures to carry this burden with pride, such as Erlach describes themselves as feeling. The comments section of Erlach's post is filled with words of support from other moms who are also at their wit's end. One such mom wrote:
I could have written this. My husband is an amazing father and partner, but yes, sometimes I do need that extra help. A pat on the back. A nap. A thank-you. An hour of alone time. Why do I still feel bad then when I ask?
But along with the need for moms to ask, dads need to step up and offer without making them do so. One mom brought up the mental load that comes along with motherhood, which can be understood as all of the invisible work that comes with running a household — the planning and organizing and prioritizing that falls to the woman more often than not:
For me it's the burden of the mental load. Let me explain. My husband will do anything that I ask them to do. The problem is I have to ask... for everything. He's genuinely oblivious, not malicious at all. Sink full of dishes? They don't see it. He'll say they "just changed the baby"... but it was 2 hours ago. They gladly took the baby out for an hour... walked out the door without the diaper bag. It's stuff like that.
They go on to explain that it is their job to "remember all of the details," rather than explain it all to their husband. They do it because they have to, and while they don't resent their husband because "he's a great guy," they admit that "it would be great for something to just get done without having to ask just once." I have no doubt that Erlach would agree with them
Erlach tells Romper that more than a letter to their husband, their post is a letter to other moms who are struggling, intended to let them know that asking for help is acceptable — even if it doesn't always feel that way:
Even looking back, I feel guilty for all the times I have asked, and still ask. But people are here for us. Our husbands, our in-laws, the local breastfeeding support group... They are everywhere and they just need you to raise your hand. Raise the flag. It is not admitting defeat, it is accepting victory with support. And that's good for you and your baby.
Moms and dads both need to look at the ways in which they distribute the massive workload associated with running a house and raising children. If there is inequality there, and there likely is, they should work to find balance. Here, like in many aspects of relationships, communication is key.

PARIS — Henri Michel, who played for France at the World Cup and later coached the team to the semifinals at the 1986 tournament, has died. They were 70.
France's Professional Footballers Association wrote on Twitter that Michel died Tuesday morning.
Michel was an accomplished midfielder who played almost their entire career at Nantes and helped the club win three French league titles. They played 58 times for France, including two games at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina.
In 1986, Michel coached the France team to the semifinals in Mexico. The team included their former teammates Michel Platini, Patrick Battiston and Dominique Rocheteau. France lost to West Germany, and then beat Belgium in the third-place game.
The new littlest prince is officially 1 day old now and the world is still obsessing over their arrival. But now that he's finally here, there are still so many questions to be answered. Like, what is their name? When will their first portrait be revealed? And when will the royal baby's christening be? Although Kensington Palace has yet to announce an official date for this traditional ceremony, there's a lot of history that can help royal watchers make an informed guess about when it could happen.
Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third royal child on Monday, April 23, and gave the world a glimpse of the little guy just hours after the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth. Weighing in at 8 pounds, 7 ounces, the newest prince was obviously an adorable site to see as their parents introduced them to a sea of fans on the steps outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in London.
It was a sweet, but brief meeting with the newborn royal and it'll probably be a matter of months until they make another public appearance. And, as The Sun reported, the next time the world will get a glimpse of them probably won't happen until the prince's christening ceremony, which will likely take place this summer. As with Prince George and Princess Charlotte's christenings, as The Sun explained, the public shouldn't expect to see this new little tike for at least two more months.

Looking back at how the royal family handled the christenings of both 4-year-old Prince George and 2-year-old Princess Charlotte, it seems that mom and dad have waited at least two months after their baby is born to take them out to another public event. For instance, Prince George was born on July 22, 2013 and was christened on Oct. 23, 2013, exactly three months after they were welcomed into the world, as People reported. Then there's Princess Charlotte, who was born on May 2, 2015, and subsequently christened on July 5, 2015, a little over two months after they were born, according to the official website for the little princess.
As such, it probably won't be until late June or July when the newest little prince makes their next appearance at their christening. While many are hoping that the upcoming royal wedding would be the next time they'd see the little prince, he's likely sitting this one out. As royal expert James Brookes told The Daily Express, the next time the public will see the baby "would be the christening in terms of the public or a fixed engagement."
While there's no confirmed date for their christening, royal watchers should expect it to happen sometime during the summer, a truly busy time for the royal family. For Prince George's christening, the royal family made their way to St. James's Palace for the special event, as CNN reported. And then, for Princess Charlotte, they mixed things up and went to St. Mary Magdalene Church at the queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, as the BBC reported.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding is set to take place on May 19, which is only a few weeks away. So it's only natural that people would wonder whether the new addition to the royal family would be there. After all, it's already been reported that Middleton is attending and their role in the royal wedding is simply an honored guest. Additionally, Prince George and Princess Charlotte will reportedly be in the wedding as well, serving as a bridesmaid (aka a flower girl) and a page boy, respectively, according to Marie Claire.
However, it seems like their little brother won't be joining them, as their grand re-entrance into high society likely won't be until their christening. And as The Sun reported, the couple's third child's christening will probably be a lot more low-key that Prince George's big day and more like Princess Charlotte's christening (probably because the two younger siblings aren't in direct line to the throne, the publication explained).
But there's still a lot to happen before their christening, as the new prince's name and some new snapshots will most likely be released first, as Brookes told The Daily Express. So until then, sit tight royal fans, because there's still a lot to look forward to and a lot of waiting to do.

President Donald Trump's mention of the opioid crisis in their State of the Union address has leaders in Ohio intrigued

Netflix's “Queer Eye” reboot has been widely celebrated for tackling issues of race and religion along with LGBTQ acceptance. But the Fab Five's food and wine expert, Antoni Porowski, wants the show to get even more political — by making over a legislator.
Speaking to Page Six at a World Immunization Week field day hosted by Rotary and Red Nose Day, the 34-year-old shared that if they could choose a “hero” for a future episode, he'd pick “anybody in politics whoare either very, very left or very, very right, who has strict one-sided views. I'd try to bring them a little closer to the middle and understand that there's always another side.”
Sans machina Sundays. A post shared by Antoni Porowski (@antoni) on Jun 11, 2017 at 2:47pm PDT
Until the Fab Five make their way to Capitol Hill, Porowski can continue to spread a message of acceptance and understanding through their preferred medium: the graphic T-shirt. Throughout Season 1 of the “Queer Eye” reboot, the food whiz modeled shirts that referenced everything from their favorite bands (The Strokes, The National) to beloved books (Hanya Yanagihara's “A Little Life”) — but were they to design their own line of statement tees, Porowski would want to send an even stronger message.
“There's a really fantastic shirt Frank Ocean wore that reads, ‘Why be racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic when you could just be quiet?'” Porowski said. “So, a message like that. I've realized the magnitude of the responsibility [the Fab Five] now have to be positive figures, and if I can do that with a T-shirt, then why not?”
It's that same sense of obligation that prompted the TV star to support an event celebrating the importance of vaccines. “Although polio is no longer present in the US, I think we have a responsibility to show up for countries that don't have the same access to health care that we do,” Porowski explained.
Dennis Bradley has thrown their hat into the ring to run for the state Senate seat in the 23rd District.
Bradley made their intentions official last week before an audience of supporters at the BDK Law Group in Bridgeport.
Bradley, a Democrat, hopes to replace Sen. Ed Gomes, who is retiring from public service at the end of their term. The 23rd District covers a small portion of Stratford and about 70% of Bridgeport.
Bradley last ran for the seat two years ago as the Democrats' endorsed candidate, but lost to Gomes in a party primary.
In a statement, Bradley said they are confident and optimistic that their advocacy and government experience will yield tangible results in terms of improving the state's financial picture.
”I love this community. I am inspired by this city. I chose Bridgeport for my home and business because I want to make a difference here. I want to represent my neighbors to ensure that Bridgeport and Stratford have not only a vote in Hartford, but a seat at the table when legislation is crafted. I am trained in law. I can help write laws. I will make sure Bridgeport has a voice.”
Bradley's platform includes judicial reform, job growth through the the expansion of local community college programs, including advanced manufacturing, creating pathways for minority teacher recruitment through networking with historically black colleges and universities, and supporting the development of a system for free university education for all CT residents. Bradley also supports current legislation for Paid Family Medical Leave and all legislation ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work.

While we wait for a new Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer, after the first footage debuted at Star Wars Celebration, we've had some intriguing new details surface lately to keep fans occupied. Yesterday, everyone got their best look yet at Snoke's praetorian guards thanks to an energy drink called Space Punch. Today, we have some leaked details about upcoming LEGO sets that will be available to purchase on Force Friday this fall. One of these sets seems to tease a potentially epic showdown between the iconic Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and their nefarious nephew, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).
These details come from a German site called Promo Bricks (courtesy of Star Wars News Net), which learned that an online German retailer has already listed Star Wars: The Last Jedi LEGO sets for this year's Force Friday event, which will take place on September 1. One of these sets is dubbed Kylo Ren's TIE Fighter, which will come with 630 pieces along with minifigures of both Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. There will also presumably be some of the elite praetorian guard figures included as well, but that has yet to be confirmed. With both Kylo Ren and Luke Skywalker in the same set, it certainly may indicate a showdown between these two characters, who wouldn't likely be featured in the same set together for any other reason.
Some of the latest rumors swirling around Star Wars: The Last Jedi reveal that Kylo Ren themselves will make their way to Ahch-To, along with their Knights of Ren, where they square off against Luke Skywalker. This report claimed that Luke Skywalker will make easy work of the Knights of Ren, killing them all in this cliff-side battle, while Kylo Ren seeks revenge against Rey in their own battle. At one point, Rey disappears, falling off the cliff, but it isn't clear what exactly happens to Rey. If this report turns out to be true, then perhaps we'll get to see part of this battle when the second trailer arrives, although Disney and LucasFilm still haven't revealed when the next trailer will in fact debut.
As for the rest of these LEGO sets, there will also be a BB-8 set, a Resistance Bomber set that will feature Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) and Paige Tico (Veronica Ngo), the sister of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). The First Order Heavy Assault Walker set will feature a different version of Poe Dameron and Rey, while the First Order Star Destroyer set comes with Supreme Leader Snoke and BB-9E, an "evil" ball droid similar to the beloved BB-8. There are also details about even more Star wars 8 toys that have come from a Reddit user, which have also yet to be confirmed.
This Redditor only has a list of product names, although Making Star Wars has seemingly deciphered most of these names. The "Black Series Foxtrot 1 Grey" is believed to be for a Rey action figure, while "BL Cool Beta Grey" is most likely Finn (John Boyega), while "Victor 1" is most likely either Supreme Leader Snoke or Kylo Ren. One of the other items "IP Deluxe Delta 1" is currently unknown, but the "IP" designation has previously been given to the "denizens of Ahch-To," so there is speculation that this product could be related to Luke Skywalker, or the small creatures that inhabit the island. Other toys include a "Spinning Lightsaber" and "Projectile Firing Lightsaber" that is believed to be repurposed from the Star Wars Rebels toy line, while the "Choose Your Path Lightsaber" item is believed to be the latest in the Bladebuilders toy line. Hopefully we'll learn more about these Star Wars: The Last Jedi toys soon.

A solidarity rally planned in London, Ont. will allow locals to take a stand against white supremacist violence, after this past weekend's tragic events in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Violence erupted in the college town on Saturday during a massive white supremacist rally. One woman was killed and several others were injured, when a man ploughed their car into counter-protesters.
“We all need to respond to this with the absolute outrage that we feel,” said solidarity rally organizer, Wendy Goldsmith.

Goldsmith is both an activist and a social worker.
“But really, deep down, I speak as a human being and particulary as a mother,” they said.
“I don't want my children to grow up in fear of racism, and hatred, and violence. I think at the very core of humanity, is what we need to speak to right now. And I think we need to practice radical love.”
READ MORE: Charlottesville: How the ‘Unite the Right' rally turned violent and sparked backlash against Donald Trump
Goldsmith says London isn't immune to incidents of oppression, bigotry, or violence, but people can continue to combat them with positive messages of love, unity and diversity.
“We insist that London is a safe place for everybody, we welcome newcomers, we welcome people from other countries, we welcome people from all colours, shapes, and sizes, and that is the message that we need to continue to send in as many ways as we can.”

The solidarity rally starts at 6 p.m. on Wednesday in the northwest corner of Victoria Park.
"The way they explained it, they just wanted me to be aggressive," Ingram said after the win. "He wanted me to be aggressive and get in the lane and make plays for myself and make plays for my teammates. I just tried to do the best job of pushing the pace tonight and making sure guys were happy with their shots."
Bird Of Prey – BMW Motorrad Concept 9cento
Are you ready for a serious dose of style and performance coming straight from Germany? Actually, the BMW Motorrad Concept 9cento debuted at the 2018 Concorso D'Eleganza at Villa d'Este, and that's next to Lake Como, Italy, but this German-made bike managed to get everyone's attention there, while challenging every design rule we've been accustomed to.
One of the most interesting features of this bike is the way its innovative luggage system was envisioned. It offers enthusiasts the best of two worlds, blending functionality and coolness, and it comes with a super lightweight case that features two side compartments, clips on and even extends the seating area for a second passenger. You're ready to go!
Fashionable and performance-oriented, this concept looks bold and powerful. Its striking style is beautifully complemented by the floating panels and windscreen, that also help create a controlled air stream and probably contribute to the impressive numbers of this bike.
The bright orange branding and the electric blue spring, not to mention the matte seat, chrome body and intricately milled aluminum central tank cover, make this motorcycle even more appealing. The iconic BMW headlights are also present on Concept 9cento, keeping in line with adventure and touring enthusiasts alike. Will this thing enter production an time soon? Hopefully we will get an answer pretty soon.
This statement was originally published on cmfr-phil.org on 23 November 2017.
Eight years, zero convictions. This summarizes the 2017 update on the trial of the accused in the Ampatuan massacre of 2009. With more than 100 charged, even a dedicated branch of the court can only do so much.
The magnitude of the trial necessarily imposes the slow pace. The decision to include so many individuals on the same charge necessarily delayed the delivery of justice.
The hearings began on 5 January 2010, less than two months after the killing of 58 persons including 32 journalists and media workers in Ampatuan town, Maguindanao, on 23 November 2009. At first, only Andal "Unsay" Ampatuan Jr. was the named accused charged before the trial court in Cotabato City. Unsay was positively identified by witnesses to have led the attack on the Mangudadatu convoy that fateful day in November 2009.
Other Ampatuan clan members, police officers, and Civilian Volunteer Organization members were later included in the charge list for the murder of 57 (later 58 counts). This brought the number of the suspected masterminds and accomplices to 197. These were individuals who were identified in two separate investigations, one by the Philippine National Police (PNP) and another by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). At present, the Department of Justice (DOJ) data show 188 persons are officially charged before the trial court.
The Ampatuan Massacre case was first filed before the trial court in Cotabato City. The DOJ and media organizations requested its transfer to the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. See the Ampatuan Massacre trial timeline.
Inevitable delay
Petitions for bail by more than 60 percent of the arrested accused, including principal suspects Unsay Ampatuan, Andal Ampatuan Sr., Zaldy Ampatuan, and their family members have further delayed the criminal proceedings.
Seventy (70) out of the 112 arrested suspects petitioned the trial court to allow them to be released on bail. Judge Jocelyn Solis-Reyes granted the petitions of 42 accused, including Sajid Islam Ampatuan and police inspector Michael Joy Macaraeg. Both Sajid Islam Ampatuan and Macaraeg were able to post bail. The other 40 accused, mostly police officers, are still detained as they still have not posted the approximately PHP11.6-million bail.
Meanwhile, on 10 October 2017, the trial court junked Unsay Ampatuan's motion asking for its reconsideration of the denial of their bail petition.
Other issues hounded the trial. The identification of some of the 197 charged was a tedious process, a problem foreseen by some lawyers involved in the Ampatuan Massacre case. For example, accused Datukan Malang Salibo questioned their arrest and continued detention through a petition for habeas corpus before the Court of Appeals in 2010. They claimed that they were not the Butukan S. Malang listed among the 197 charged in the Ampatuan Massacre. The Court of Appeals denied their petition. But, in April 2015, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the appellate court and ordered Salibo's release.
Eighty-two (82) accused still remain at-large, or approximately 44 percent of the 188 officially charged. Like the two preceding governments which did not issue directives for the immediate capture of the accused, the Duterte administration has not issued any clear policy on the arrest of those still at large. At present, 102 accused are currently detained at Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig City. Four have died while in detention, including clan patriarch Andal Ampatuan Sr.
Meanwhile, three accused were acquitted by the Quezon City trial court on demurrer last June 23. The trial court granted the demurrer to evidence of Kominie Inggo, Dexson Saptula, and Abas Anongan as the court found weak evidence that they directly participated in the murders. According to the Quezon City court, no prosecution eyewitness saw them at the massacre site, at the checkpoints, or at the meeting where the crime was planned. A defendant may file a demurrer to evidence if they believe that there is no sufficient evidence against them after the prosecution rested its case. (Click here for more information)
Defense presentation of evidence-in-chief
The prosecution panel had concluded its presentation of witnesses and evidence in 2016. The prosecution submitted its formal offer of evidence for 108 accused; only those in connection with Unsay Ampatuan, Jonathan Engid and five others are yet to be filed. Engid was arrested only in February 2017; meanwhile, the trial only ruled against Unsay's bail this year.
The Quezon City trial court is now hearing evidence of the defense. Nena Santos, a private prosecutor in the Ampatuan Massacre case, said that more or less seven accused will begin presenting their evidence in November and December 2017 and in the first quarter of 2018. Santos is hopeful that all defense lawyers can finish their presentation by 2018. With this, they believe that the court would be ruling on the guilt of the accused masterminds, accessories and accomplices.
Last November 17, during a regular meeting of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security, the DOJ reported that 22 accused already terminated their presentation of evidence. The cases against 13 accused have been submitted for decision.
A hopeful end
The exact end of their prolonged agony may remain unclear, but the families remain hopeful that justice will be served when it comes. In a press conference last November 21, Maguindanao District Rep. Zajid Mangudadatu said that: "The wounds may have healed but the abuse and impunity that the perpetrators of the Ampatuan, Maguindanao Massacre still remain fresh and bleeding. It will only stop when we have achieved justice."
HAMPDEN -- With news of the imminent demise of Thornton W. Burgess Middle School, alumni of the 50-year-old school are sharing thoughts and memories of the institution they cherished.
Hampden-Wilbraham Regional School District Superintendent Albert G. Ganem Jr. announced Thursday that the school, named after the famous children's book author of the same name who lived in town, is slated to close at the end of the current school year due to declining enrollment and other factors.
Next year, the remaining 100 or so TWB students will be educated at Green Meadows Elementary School -- Hampden's only other school in the seven-school district. They will also have the option of going to Wilbraham Middle School, according to Ganem.
For Sally Schmuck Maloney, TWB will always be a place of fond memories.
"I was in fifth grade the first year that TWB was open," they said, referring to 1967, the year the school at 85 Wilbraham Road debuted.
"I'm pretty sure I won the 1,000-meter race in eighth grade," they told The Republican on Thursday.
"Pretty good memories, said Maloney.
Like the time they got a new pair of glasses, and Mrs. Moriary, their fifth-grade teacher, "made me stand up in front so everyone could look at them," they said.
Another teacher, "Mr. Gray," once wore an orange tie to school on St. Patrick's Day, and "the other teachers came in and cut it off," said Maloney -- an allusion, perhaps, to the sectarian conflict and colors of Ireland: orange being the so-called Protestant color in the Irish flag, and green being the color of Irish Catholics.
If memory serves Maloney correctly, Mrs. Flaherty was the teacher who led the tie-cutting revolt.
Another recollection involved a seventh-grade social studies teacher who "promised us an A if we could remember all the names of the African countries and place them on the map," said Maloney. "Easiest A ever received."
For Joanne Baush Bongiorni, the closure of TWB represents the end of an era.
"I'm very sad," they posted on "566: Hampden Matters," a popular community Facebook page that's doubled as a clearinghouse for information about efforts to save TWB.
Bongiorni, who moved to Hampden from Wilbraham when they were in eighth grade, remembers when Hampden middle-schoolers went to school at the Town House, which houses Hampden's library and town government.
"When we first got there, we were in the lower half of the library," they said. "Then we moved to this beautiful new school. It just makes me so sad. All the way around."
"As a former student at TWB, this makes me sad," Katie Lanzoni posted on the "566" page. "As an educator and a parent, I find it wildly inappropriate to have seventh- and 12th-graders together."
Lanzoni was referring to one of the proposals in Ganem's reorganization plan, which will be the subject of a public forum at 7 p.m. Wednesday in Minnechaug's auditorium.
The plan, in part, calls for converting Green Meadows Elementary School into a K-8 school beginning in the fall 2018 semester. Five years later, Green Meadows would become a K-6 school, while Hampden students in grades 7-12 would attend Minnechaug.
"It was a delight to have a new school," said Beverly Roy St. Pierre, who also spent their earlier years in Hampden at the Town House.
The transition to Minnechaug proved difficult for St. Pierre.
"If you look back in the yearbooks, no Hampden kids were class officers," they said. "Nobody knew who we were."
It will be hard for Hampden seventh- and eighth-graders to be in "a huge high school," St. Pierre said, wishing them "good luck."
Sheree Goodrich Butts has a very specific concern about TWB, after the school is officially decommissioned on July 1, 2018.
"I want to know if the classes that graduated from TWB will be able to get our time capsules that were buried when our class trees were planted," they asked. "It would be a shame to leave them there. I dont know how many classes have them, but I do know my class did."
"The School Committee failed a school that, when we attended as kids, would never allow us to fail," said Chip LeClerc, a proud TWB alumnus.
"Although I still cringe when I think of Mrs. Gerrard or Mrs. Siano, I am grateful for teachers such as Mrs. Foley, who started me on my path as a professional writer," LeClerc said.
Mr. Gray and Mr. Drury encouraged LeClerc, an under-achieving student, "to want to learn," they said. "Once again, we are losing part of our town's identity to money and numbers."
The future of the TWB building and the nearly 30-acre town-owned site it sits on has not yet been publicly discussed by Hampden officials, though ideas are being bandied about on social media.
Some residents have suggested moving all town government offices to the building, which is still in good shape, while others say the property should be sold and the proceeds used to balance the town's books.
Were you up and watching the nominations this morning?
No, I was not. I was asleep. The publicist called. I know, I know. It was amazing.
This is actually your first Globe nomination?
It is my first. I've actually never been. It always looks like such fun, it just looks like a real party. I'm excited to go.
What does it mean to be recognized for this role in particular?
Maybe it connected with people. All of the nominations the film got is heartening. Whenever you make a movie, you want it to connect with people, you want it to connect on an emotional level. That's the reason you made it. And when it does, it's just, to be back in high school, it's just really cool.
Your character finds themselves as an unlikely co-conspirator in spiriting away the creator. Is there anything in particular you enjoyed about the character?
I love somebody who does something that they're terrified to do. So you know they're doing it for a good reason. It's not easy for them, it's just really hard. And they'd do anything to get out of it, but they go through with it. It's what the movie is about, it's about love, their love for Eliza [Sally Hawkins] and their understanding finally that they are their dearest friend.
Federal disability law requires movie theaters to provide specialized interpreters to patrons who are deaf and blind, an appeals court said Friday.
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Cinemark, the nation's third-largest movie chain, in a case involving a Pennsylvania man who wanted to see the 2014 movie "Gone Girl" and asked a Cinemark theater in Pittsburgh to supply a "tactile interpreter." The theater denied their request.
The plaintiff, Paul McGann, is a movie enthusiast who reads American Sign Language through touch. They use a method of tactile interpretation that involves placing their hands over the hands of an interpreter who uses sign language to describe the movie's action, dialogue and even the audience response.
The federal appeals court concluded Friday that tactile interpreters are covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that public accommodations furnish "auxiliary aids and services" to patrons with vision, hearing and speech disabilities.

"It would be impossible for a deaf-blind person to experience the movie and understand the content without the provision of tactile interpretation," said Carol A. Horowitz, managing attorney of Disability Rights Pennsylvania, which filed suit on McGann's behalf.
The ruling said Cinemark still can argue that providing the interpreters would present an "undue burden," an exception to the disability law that takes into account the cost of the accommodation and the business's ability to pay for it. It sent the case back to a federal judge to consider that argument.
Because of the intensive nature of the work, McGann requires the services of two interpreters. The interpreters cost a few hundred dollars per showing.
Cinemark earned $257 million in 2016. The movie chain also has said that before McGann, it had never before received a request for tactile interpretation.
A spokesperson for the Plano, Texas-based chain said Cinemark is evaluating its legal options.
The U.S. Department of Justice filed documents in support of McGann.

Pupils at Bun-Sgoil Ghàidhlig Loch Abar (Lochaber Gaelic Primary School) are promoting their new album, Air Oidhche Nollaig, which is available now.
The album is part of a project to raise money for school funds, with partial funding from Bòrd na Gàidhlig, and features new Gaelic Christmas material, produced by famous Scottish traditional musicians.
The CD has been available for pre-order since the start of December but physical copies are now available from the school office or by ordering online at bsgla.co.uk
The Federal Reserve is raising its benchmark interest rate for the third time in six months, providing its latest vote of confidence in a slow-growing but durable economy.
The Fed also announced plans to start gradually paring its bond holdings later this year, which could cause long-term rates to rise.
The increase in the short-term rate by a quarter-point to a still-low range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent could lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and slightly better returns for savers.
The central bank chose to raise rates again despite an economic slowdown at the start of 2017, which it predicts will prove temporary. It foresees one additional rate hike this year, unchanged from its previous forecast. It gave no hint of when that might occur.

Ingolstadt's all-new 2018 Audi R8 Spyder V10 Plus is the fastest convertible model from the brand. Like the R8 Plus coupe, the R8 Spyder Plus sports a wailing 5.2-liter V-10 engine that packs 610 hp and 413 lb-ft of torque — an increase of 70 hp and 15 lb-ft over the regular model.
The Quattro all-wheel-drive beast's powerplant is mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. It'll get you from 0-62 mph in a blistering 3.3 seconds and has a top speed of 203.8 mph, according to Audi.
“The Audi R8 Spyder V10 plus completes the R8 model line,” said Stephan Winkelmann, Audi managing director, in a statement.
The Spyder V10 Plus weighs in at a healthy 3,737 pounds — the same as the regular Spyder and 55.1 pounds less than the coupe, Audi claims. The cloth top is lowered and raised via an electrohydraulic motor that takes 20 seconds to open or close at speeds up to 31.1 mph.
It folds into a Z-shape and is stored in a flat compartment over the engine. Audi says the rear window sinks into the bulkhead, but can be retracted and extended electrically.
In addition to the 11 standard paint flavors, the top is available in three shades, and the side blades can be specified in five colors.
The R8 Spyder Plus' exclusive new micrommata green paint job gives it a Hulk-like appearance and the optional design package has an anthracite gray single-frame grille and black tailpipe covers. The interior is in all black Nappa leather with green stitching accents on the seats, center armrests, doors, and floor mats.
Audi says the leather on the bucket seats have a special pigmenting that stops them from heating up in the sun's rays, which sounds like a big V10 plus for us.
The Spyder V10 also gets a large 12.3-inch Audi virtual cockpit and a rockin' Bang & Olufsen sound system with loudspeakers in the seats — that Audi says can actually be heard over the engine noise with the top down.
In addition, optional Audi laser light LED headlights are available and will make you look really freakin' cool at night.
Orders are now being accepted and the first cars will be delivered in the late summer. The base price in Germany is about $234,174.
Audi will announce pricing details for the U.S. when the launch date is finalized here. Stay tuned.

A serial by-election candidate is contemplating hanging up their Elvis jumpsuit after nearly two decades in politics.
David Bishop, of the Bus Pass Elvis party, has stood in 11 parliamentary contests since 1997 on platforms including legalising brothels and giving OAPs a discount, outlawing builders' bums and scrapping HS2.
Mr Bishop, a 72-year-old former painter and decorator from Nottingham, said while they have enjoyed their time on the campaign trail, their most recent campaign in Sleaford and North Hykeham will be theirs last.
Also known as Lord Biro, Mr Bishop got into politics through art, starting off as a poet. When the chance came to stand against Neil Hamilton in the 1997 election following the Cash for Questions scandal, Mr Bishop decided to give it a go.
They said: "When I was a teenager, I wasn't that interested in politics. I was interested in green things - and the first time I ever voted was the EEC referendum.
"Standing in Tatton was the first one, that got a lot of media attention from all over the world and I really enjoyed it."
At the poll, Mr Bishop wound up eighth out of the 10 candidates - coming in with 116 for the Lord Byro versus the Scallywag Tories party.
In the nearly 20 years since, Lord Byro became Lord Biro, and they have been a regular feature at by-elections, including Haltemprice and Howden in 2008 following the resignation of David Davis, Eastleigh in 2013 following Chris Huhne's departure from the Commons and 2015 when Patrick Mercer stepped aside in Newark.
Their peak came in 2014 when they beat the Liberal Democrats at a by-election for the Clifton North ward at Nottingham City Council, but wound up more than 1,100 votes off the winner.
The result made headlines across the country and Mr Bishop said: "I feel a bit guilty about that because they haven't done very well since.
"It was their own fault, they didn't campaign really. If they had campaigned they probably would have beaten me."
When asked if they would actually like to become a Member of Parliament, Mr Bishop said they were not so sure.
"If I had been elected in Sleaford, I would have been pleased in one way but I would have hoped Theresa May called a general election next summer so I'd only have six months," they said.
"I'd probably end up in the Priory but I'd try and make a difference while I was there."
Mr Bishop said they are political - believing strongly in wildlife conservation, preserving public services and rural transport - and tried to register as a supporter for the Labour Party to elect Jeremy Corbyn as leader but was turned down.
They said: "I paid my £3, but wasn't allowed to vote as I was part of a rival party."
With the bill of 11 by-elections running to £5,500 - or £6.13 per vote - the price of democracy is not cheap for Mr Bishop.
They said: "It's a lot of money. These last ones (Witney and Sleaford and North Hykeham) I stayed in all summer and tried to save some money out of my pension and I did a couple of odd jobs.
"I didn't go out for about two months because I thought there was going to be a general election.
"Then the rumours were that they aren't going to call one. When David Cameron resigned, I thought 'I'm all geared up to go, get on with it'."
The miles spent on the campaign trail have begun to take their toll but Mr Bishop is not planning on totally moving away from politics.
They said: "I will still be interested and I will still campaign on things - I saw the news about red phone boxes disappearing and I think they should stay.
"One of the last leaflets I posted before the Sleaford by-election was at the Packet Inn in Dogdyke and I thought 'Dave, this might be a sign that it's time to call it a day'.
"I've enjoyed a lot of it: I've enjoyed going around all these villages that I wouldn't have otherwise seen, these obscure little villages, and talking to guys with dogs, old ladies in the street, especially with the Elvis jumpsuit on."
India's FIFA World Cup dream finally became a reality in front of 46,000 plus people, but that was not complemented by the ideal result as the USA, led by Josh Sargent saw them off with a 3-0 score line in their opening Group A game.The evening began on an electric note with Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeting both the Indian and the USA team alongside India's Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Rathore, FIFA VP Sheikh Salman and FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samour.The India U-17 team was welcomed with an electric atmosphere, and even though they tried to hold their own, the more experienced USA took advantage of a nervous debut.As expected, veterans at this stage USA began the game the stronger of the two sides, but Dheeraj Singh literally stood tall against the rampaging Josh Sargent and company.USA, with Tim Weah, Sargent and Andrew Carleton leading the attack were all over the Indian defence, who time and again needed to depend on the duo of Jitendra Singh and Anwar Ali to bail them out.India began the game without a designated right back and needed Rahul KP to fill in for the evening. The hosts as expected held a tight line in defence as a ploy to contain their more fancied opponents. Komal Thatal – easy to recognise with their blonde hair along with Aniket Jadhav were mostly left to feed off scraps.The Blue Colts' resistance though was broken down on the half hour mark, as Josh Sargent, converted the penalty they won after Jitendra Singh decided either the ball or the player was going past – and the ball was gone.Sargent, did not hesitate and as one would expect from him, calmly slotted away from 12 yards out.The Blue Colts were finding it hard to get their passing going in the final third and had not registered a shot on target neither had managed to trouble Justin Garces in goal through the majority of the first half.Just before the interval though India did manage to make more than a solitary foray into the attacking third – but Aniket Jadhav's shot was comfortably collected by Garces.The second half began with India looking to make some early in-roads and make their presence felt along with the 40,000 plus people at the stadium.But within minutes, the momentum was back with the stronger and more organised visitors. Carleton smashed it goal wards but Dheeraj, a standout performer on the day, saved the day once again.Not for long though, as the India were caught napping in their own box and Chris Durkin volleyed it past Dheeraj, who had no chance of making a save after Anwar Ali's deflection. The majestic JLN had been silenced, as the Durkin and co reeled away in celebration.The hosts found it hard to get out of their defensive shape with the USA enjoying the lion's share of the possession throughout the game. For a moment just after the hour mark though – everyone held their breath as Komal Thatal's sneaked in and almost embarrassed Garces and the US defence when their lob over the keeper landed just over the crossbar.On the hot, sultry evening the visitors were starting to tire, and de Matos brought in Naorem and Rahim Ali – a move that paid dividends almost immediately as Naorem's quick feet forced US on the back feet.True to John Hackworth's words, the Indian team cheered on by the home crowd continued to run hard.India welcomed the final ten minutes of the game with a rasping left foot strike from Suresh Wangjam which seemed set for the top corner, only to be blocked for a corner.Anwar Ali, desperate to make up for their failure at stopping the second goal found themselves in space with time on hand – but their right footed hit ricocheted of the cross bar.That unfortunately for Indians fell to George Acosta who set Carleton free and they made no mistake in wrapping up what was eventually a comfortable three points for the visitors.India play Colombia next on October 9, in the national capital where a defeat could bring their World Cup campaign to an end.
Flawless Federer gives Wimbledon masterclass, Venus hits back
London, July 4 (AFP) Roger Federer extended their flawless winning streak at Wimbledon to 26 consecutive sets as the defending champion crushed Lukas Lacko, while Venus Williams battled back to beat Alexandra Dulgheru in Wednesday's second round action.
Federer delivered a Centre Court masterclass lasting 89 minutes as the Swiss star hit 48 winners and 16 aces in their 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 victory.
The 36-year-old is now on their joint second longest streak of sets won at Wimbledon -- their best was 34 between the third round in 2005 to the 2006 final.
Next up for Federer is a third round tie against 39-year-old Croatian Ivo Karlovic or German world number 64 Jan-Lennard Struff.
In their 20th Wimbledon appearance, top seed Federer, a 20-time major winner, is bidding to become only the second player to claim nine singles titles at the England Club after Martina Navratilova.
On the evidence of their ruthless demolition of Slovakian world number 73 Lacko, it will take something special to stop Federer making more Wimbledon history.
"I played very well. I felt good out there, fewer nerves than in the first round," Federer said.
"I'm happy how I am hitting the ball, good concentration on my service games and able to mix it up with some slices.
"Of course, you sometimes play the percentages, but if you do that too much it becomes boring, so I like to mix it up.
"I clearly enjoy the path more where it comes easier, not wasting too much energy is always nice." Five-time champion Venus Williams battled into the third round with a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 win over Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru.
Venus reached their ninth Wimbledon final last year, but the American star was denied a sixth title by Garbine Muguruza.
They returned to the England Club stuck in a rut after losing in the first round of both the Australian and French Opens this year.
Making their 21st Wimbledon appearance, 38-year-old Venus is the oldest woman in this year's tournament.
But they didn't look their age in making it 89 career match wins at Wimbledon by demolishing Dulgheru in the final two sets.
Asked if their wealth of Wimbledon experience was a key factor, Venus said: "I'd love to have that extra advantage. If that's working for me I'm all for it.
"It's just about winning the match. If that's your best or not doesn't matter." Venus next faces Dutch 20th seed Kiki Bertens, who beat Russian world number 107 Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-0.
Milos Raonic slammed 34 aces as the 2016 Wimbledon finalist won 7-6 (7/4, 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4) against Australia's John Millman.
The Canadian 13th seed will play Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak, who beat French 17th seed Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8/10), 3-6, 6-2.
Sam Querrey, the 11th seed, stepped up their bid to emulate last year's run to the semi-finals with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3, 6-3 win against Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky. Querrey's fellow American Madison Keys, seeded 10th, celebrated US Independence Day with a 6-4, 6-3 win against Thailand's Luksika Kumkhum.
Croatian world number 55 Donna Vekic followed up their shock success against fourth seed Sloane Stephens with a 7-5, 6-4 victory against Sweden's Rebecca Peterson. Romanian 29th seed Mihaela Buzarnescu thrashed British teenager Katie Swan, 6-0, 6-3 to extend their remarkable renaissance.
A year ago, Buzarnescu was ranked 213 and lost in Wimbledon qualifying -- yet now they will face Czech seventh seed Karolina Pliskova for a place in the last 16. Former world number one Pliskova has finally made it to the third round on their seventh visit to Wimbledon after seeing off two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka 6-3, 6-3.
Former Wimbledon finalist Agnieszka Radwanska lost 7-5, 6-4 to Czech world number 66 Lucie Safarova
Nevertheless, the team does not insist that their results prove insects were the primary reason that plants developed spines, prickles and thorns. To the contrary, Kariyat said, “We think that spines evolved against mammalian herbivores.” But they suspect that at some point in history, the horsenettles and other plants found an even more effective weapon — toxic alkaloids in their tissues — and mammals stopped eating them regularly. The caterpillars, which were largely unaffected by the alkaloids, became specialists at preying on the plants. Evolution may then have co-opted the plants' spines for a new defensive purpose, a phenomenon known as exaptation. “So over time, these spines have started to have an additional benefit, helping the plant win the arms race” against the insects, they said.
The unexpected results were a bit hard for others in the field to swallow. “When I first read this paper, my overwhelming response was: ‘Oh, that's just [nonsense] — there are so many problems!'” said Angela Moles, a research professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who studies the ecological strategies of plants. “Then the more I read it, the more I was, like, ‘Actually, it's right.'” Them sentiments were echoed by Mick Hanley, an associate professor at Plymouth University in the United Kingdom, who was lead author on a 2007 review paper about plants' structural defenses. “I looked at it at first and I thought, hmm. Then I read it again, and I saw that it all sort of hangs together,” they said.
Others are less convinced. “I'm not sure that we can conclude from their results that spinescence is an adaptation against insect herbivory,” said Tristan Charles-Dominique, a plant-evolution specialist at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in China. They and William Bond, emeritus professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, used phylogenetic methods to show in 2016 that the diversity of spiny plants in Africa coincided with an uptick in bovid mammals, such as wildebeests and gazelles. That finding supports the traditional view that spines defend against large mammals.
“I think they did a good job at showing that the feeding rate of caterpillars is indeed slowed down as their movement is disrupted,” said Charles-Dominique, but “I think that there is quite a lot of information to be gathered before being able to test the potential coevolution between spiny plants and insects.”
Kariyat does not disagree. “One of the things we want to see is whether this effect is just on the caterpillars,” they said. They explained that they also want to better quantify how insects are affected by impaired movement: “How much does it affect their growth and development and pupation, and how does that affect them long term?”
But Kariyat and Mescher's findings aren't the first to suggest a potential role for spinescence in deterring insects. Moles noted that the results are consistent with paleontological evidence that spines evolved before large herbivores. They pointed to a 1970 review paper by the late British paleobotanist William Gilbert Chaloner, in which they noted that a number of plants from more than 400 million years ago showed “small apparently non-vascularized appendages on the stem, distributed more or less randomly … and variously termed spines, emergences, teeth or enations.”
“So we've got a lot of species with these funny prickles that we don't know what they do,” Moles explained, “and it's, I don't know, at least 10 or 20 million years before the first terrestrial vertebrate herbivores start appearing.”
The results highlight a tricky issue in the study of evolution and adaptation: Because of exaptation, understanding the current function of a trait is very different from inferring the evolutionary pressures under which it initially evolved. “It's impossible to track why a defense that works now might have evolved millions of years ago,” Hanley said. “Those spines could have evolved for a completely different reason that has nothing to do with herbivory.”
Indeed, hypotheses about the original purpose of plant spines range far beyond the deterrence of herbivores of various sizes. It's been theorized that the spines might have boosted plants' surface area to enhance photosynthesis, or that they helped to direct water to the plants' roots. Or that they first helped plants to sprawl and climb. “Other than being able to replay the evolutionary tape over millions of years,” Hanley said, “we've got no real way of knowing.”

Saturday's clash with Fleetwood Town will not only see Graham Alexander return to the team they used to manage, but also the return of Paddy Madden. The former Scunthorpe number 9 left the Iron after a five year spell with the club, having registered 167 league appearances and 52 goals.
The Cod Army also lost three of their better players during the January transfer window, as left-back Amari'i Bell joined Blackburn Rovers, Aiden O'Neill returned to parent club Burnely, and top scorer Devante Cole signed for Wigan Athletic and have not been in great form as of late - losing six of their last 10 games and particularly struggling at home.
However, Iron boss Alexander is certainly not taken their old side for granted, as they expect a tough game at Highbury Stadium come Saturday afternoon.
“We know of their qualities, they have a lot of quality players in their ranks.
“But we know where we can do well and we focus on that, and how we can do against them. I know I say it regularly but it's all about how we perform. If we perform to the levels that we are capable of we give ourselves a great chance of winning the game.”
Alexander will be returning to Highbury to face their old club for only the second time as United manager, and whilst they look forward to seeing some old friends from their time with Town, they are fully concentrating on picking up a much needed three points after four games without a win.
“I'll see some familiar faces, some good friends which I made whilst spending time at the club – but I'm there for business and to do a job.
“I always enjoy going to away grounds, enjoy the challenge and of course when it's a former club there's that little bit extra in it from both sides. But, I have been in the game long enough to box off emotions and focus on the important things.
“We're going there to get three points.”
On the injury front, Alexander stated that it is unlikely that Matt Gilks (calf) and Neal Bishop (knee) will be included in the side.
The pair were out on the grass yesterday (Thursday) in training, but still may not be fully recovered from their respective injuries, and the Iron boss hinted that they will not risk them for this Saturday.
“They'll both be on the grass today doing their own thing. Saturday will be a bit of a squeeze for them, but hopefully we get them back as soon as possible.
“We don't know exactly where they are in terms of their general physical fitness, so we have to assess that in training today before we make the decision for them and for us. We don't want to risk them if they aren't fully fit, that would be counterproductive.
“When we had a fully fit squad our results have been fantastic. We need players like Gilks and Bish back in our side and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later.”
Elsewhere, new loan signing Marnick Vermijl, who joined on deadline day from Preston North End for the remainder of the season, could be available for selection.
“We want them in the team as quickly as possible, but if they aren't physically up for it, we will make that right as soon as we can. They feel like they are ready to go.”
After six goals in eleven games, Kevin van Veen was surprisingly sold to Northampton Town on Tuesday and it will be intriguing to see how Alexander plans to line their team up with only three strikers now at the club.

LONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices were steady on Wednesday as concerns about political turmoil in Italy and over a trade conflict between China and the United States outweighed strength in the dollar.
Italy kept the dollar at 10-month highs versus the euro amid concerns that repeat elections may become a de-facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc.
The turbulence underpinned gold due to its appeal as a store of value during political and financial uncertainty.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, hovered near its 6-1/2 month peak from the previous session. A stronger dollar makes assets such as gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, curbing demand.
"There has been a little bit of support from what has been happening in Italy and the potential implications for the Eurozone from the Italian crisis," Capital Economics commodities economist Simona Gambarini said.
"But it doesn't seem like the worries are big enough to warrant an increase in prices," they said, adding that price support was slightly eroded by the potential for an interest rate increase in June by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields on Tuesday registered their largest one-day drop since Brexit nearly two years ago. Higher rates could dent demand for non-interest-paying gold.
Spot gold barely changed at $1,298.98 per ounce by 0932 GMT while U.S. gold futures for June delivery edged slightly lower to $1,298.70 per ounce.
China on Wednesday lashed out at Washington's unexpected statement that it still holds the threat of imposing tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods, saying Beijing was ready to fight back in any trade war.
But Capital Economics' Gambarini said the potential trade war between China and the United States was mostly priced into gold, which would need an escalation or resolution to become a catalyst to prices again.
Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.35 percent to 851.45 tonnes on Tuesday.
In other precious metals, spot silver was stead at $16.40 an ounce.
Platinum fell 0.5 percent to $899.35 an ounce, while palladium was 0.6-percent lower at $973.90.

I am a devoted mom, an advertising executive, a Drake fan, an avid runner, a wannabe interior designer—and a black woman.
All of those labels define me at any given moment more than my basic demographic profile online. When I see advertising that reflects those interests and introduces new information or helpful products, I'm intrigued, engaged even.
Yet more often than not, ad creative and targeting appears to be based on reaching a woman of a certain age, of a certain ethnicity who lives in a certain area, using a certain device—without leveraging deeper insights to demonstrate an understanding of my experience.
Once in a while it works, but usually I receive ads that don't match my interests or needs at all. The communication is not authentic. It's frequently almost tone deaf.
We all know that authenticity in advertising is essential to driving impact. People-based marketing is a meaningful step forward on a strategic level. As an industry, we're moving beyond targeting only by cookies and devices and looking more holistically at understanding the person.
With streaming data, we have access to a rich and textured data set that enables a much deeper understanding than ever before. As people stream music in more moments throughout the day, we're learning much more about their moods, mindsets and behaviors over time.
When we know more about people's passions, the brief or target audience transcends "reach Hispanic A18-39 on mobile." It becomes "reach business owners during their commute who are obsessed with technology" or "find moms while they're working out who want healthy snack options." Imagine all the creative opportunities born from briefs that are informed by contextual insights.
People-based marketing is only the beginning. There's another transformation that we, as an industry, need to make. Now that we understand and can identify audiences, we need the right creative. And to nail the creative messaging, we have to make sure the right people have a seat at the table.
A diverse team brings varied experiences and points of view to the conversation which shine through in the creative. Without those diverse voices, you squander the opportunity to connect in a real way, an authentic way that drives brand value and outcomes.
This year, I believe the diversity conversation has moved from talk to real action for the first time in a while. Creatives and marketers seeking inspiration are boldly taking on some heavy issues that plague our communities and the advertising industry and threaten creativity.
The year 2017 has also been marked by ads and content that highlight inclusion and multicultural harmony like AirBnB's Super Bowl Spot and Spotify's "I'm with the Banned." We're collectively recognizing that diversity isn't a buzzword; it is a business imperative.
When brands understand how to connect with their consumers, they win big across the board. In order to get there, we need to have diverse teams and more people of color in leadership positions. We need to take advantage of the abounding technological advances, but not at the expense of cultural connection. Brands can't simply preach multi-cultural narratives; we have to live them from the inside out.
At Cannes this summer, it was refreshing to look around and see people of all genders, colors and backgrounds discussing their experiences and sharing ideas. To my surprise, Jesse Jackson joined me straight from their keynote at the Palais, where they championed our industry.
"Advertising over the years has helped to push boundaries and knock down walls," they said. "Topics such as interracial and same-sex marriage have been brought to the forefront of the social consciousness in no small measure through their depiction in advertising."
It's clear that we have more work to do. Let's get after it. The truth is we can't afford not to.

MADRID (Reuters) - British business person Bill Browder, a prominent Kremlin critic, was detained and then released by Spanish police on Wednesday, after a warrant from Russia for their arrest for tax evasion was found to be invalid, police said.
The head of investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, Browder led a campaign to expose corruption and punish Russian officials they blame for the 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, who they employed as a lawyer.
A Russian court sentenced Browder to nine years in prison in absentia in December after finding them guilty of deliberate bankruptcy and tax evasion.
Browder said on their Twitter account that Interpol had advised Spanish police not to honour a Russian Interpol red notice - a request to locate and provisionally arrest someone pending extradition.
"This is the sixth time that Russia has abused Interpol in my case," they tweeted, following their release from a Madrid police station.
Browder had been held in police custody for the "minimum necessary time" and was released because the warrant issued by Russian authorities was invalid, Spanish police said in a statement on Twitter.
The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Browder was in Madrid to give evidence to Jose Grinda, a Spanish prosecutor who spearheads investigations into organised crime, about money from the Magnitsky case that has flowed to Spain, the British business person said on Twitter.
They later posted a tweet and photograph of themselves at Madrid's Barajas airport saying they had cleared Spanish immigration without problems and was on their way back to London.
Magnitsky was arrested in 2008 shortly after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. Their death nearly a year later while awaiting trial caused an international uproar.
Browder has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of a personal vendetta over the business person's efforts to get other countries to impose so-called Magnitsky sanctions against Russian individuals.
British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday they had spoken to Browder and was glad they had been released.
"Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of Magnitsky to justice," Johnson said in a tweet.

The National Minimum Wage Bill, the Labour Relations Amendment Bill and the Basic Conditions of Employment Amendment Bill were adopted by the National Assembly on Tuesday evening.
The adoption of the National Minimum Wage Bill was a major step in the process spearheaded by President Cyril Ramaphosa when they were deputy president and taken forward by the National Economic Development and Labour Council.
The DA opposed all three bills, which will now be sent for processing by the National Council of Provinces.
Cosatu welcomed the adoption of the bills, describing it as “an historic victory for millions of workers” and the outcome of a long struggle.
Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant said in the debate on the bills that they were “pleased the journey towards addressing the needs of the lowest-paid workers in the labour market has reached this milestone”.
They noted that the call for a national minimum wage dated back to the adoption of the Freedom Charter of 1955, and it was a call taken up in the 2014 election manifesto of the ANC.
The National Minimum Wage Bill establishes the initial minimum wage at R20 per hour, while the wage for domestic workers and farmworkers will initially be set at R15 and R18 an hour, respectively, though these will be adjusted within two years of implementation.
Provision is made for exemptions for employers who cannot afford the minimum wage, and sectoral wage determinations will continue.
The Labour Relations Amendment Bill restricts picketing and provides for a secret ballot before strike action.
The Basic Conditions of Employment Bill deals with the extension of bargaining council agreements.
During the debate, acting labour committee chairperson Sharome van Schalkwyk rejected accusations that the process of dealing with the bills had been rushed.
They emphasised that the national minimum wage was not a living wage as it would merely provide a basic floor. A living wage would provide enough to lead a decent life.
Van Schalkwyk said R20 per hour was a starting point, but would increase the income of about 6.6-million workers now working below the national minimum wage. The proposal of a R12,500 a month minimum wage made by the South African Federation of Trade Unions was not realistic and would harm the economy, they said.
The EFF rejected the level at which the national minimum wage had been set, while the IFP rejected the notion of a national minimum wage and argued for sectoral minimum wages.

Airbus on Tuesday put forward a possible successor to the German army's increasingly outdated fleet of Tornado aircraft, offering to further develop its Eurofighter jets for the Bundeswehr.
"The Eurofighter is already the backbone of the German Air Force and thus a logical option for a medium-term takeover of the Tornado's capabilities," said Airbus sales director Bernhard Brenner.
Brenner added that the Bundeswehr's fleet currently includes 130 Eurofighters and 90 Tornados.
The Bundeswehr is expected to soon retire the Tornado 2025 from its fleet. It remains unclear whether the Eurofighter can take over its functions or whether US-built aircraft will also come be considered.
From Airbus' view, an enhanced Eurofighter could also eventually become the basis for a European fighter jet, part of a security and defense programm agreed to by Germany and France last year.
The company plans to submit a proposed development schedule in June.
A woman arrested in connection to a 2017 drug induced homicide has taken a plea deal. Court records show 42-year-old Charlonda Crittenden pleaded guilty to drug charges and received seven years in prison. Homicide charges were dropped.
Crittenden was arrested in April of last year for an incident that happened in January. That's when police were called to the 3700 block of 9th Street and discovered the body of Adam Verdick.

Being originally from California, when I want to lighten the mood, I usually reach for a something from the Golden State, like the dependably delicious Hagafen Sauvignon Blanc 2016 ($27) from Napa Valley, or the always enjoyable Covenant Red C Rose 2016 ($35) from Sonoma. Both are absolutely fine choices, and I recommend them unreservedly.
At this moment, however, I found myself reaching for the latest vintage of Alsatian Riesling from the Abarbanel Wine Co. With its new “Lemminade” light green and yellow label and packaging, the bottle just seemed bright and inviting.
This 2015 Riesling was hand-harvested from 40-year-old vines in the Haut-Rhin region of Alsace. Situated in eastern France, bordering Germany to the north and east, and Switzerland to the south, the Alsace is known for its white wines, such as its clean, bright, typically dry and generally linear Rieslings, and dry-to-off-dry Gewurztraminers.
There are only a handful of kosher Alsatian Rieslings in the U.S. market at any given moment, and other enjoyable examples of kosher Riesling are also available from California, Canada, Germany and Israel. The glass before me now, however, is this:
Abarbanel, Lemminade, Riesling, Vin D'Alsace, Semi-Dry, Old-Vine, 2015 ($18; non-mevushal): Clean, bright, fresh and really lovely with citrus and refined floral aromatics followed on the palate with the fresh, racy tang of sour lemon, tart apple, great minerality, zippy acidity and a little spice, and all in fine balance creating an almost crystalline or delicate effect for a wine that otherwise has some nice heft and mouthful. Overall, this is vivacious and food-friendly, with reserved, Old World charm. Serve lightly chilled.
Since it is still available, try comparing the new vintage to the previous one (with the old packaging) — Abarbanel, Old Vine Riesling, Batch 66, Vin D'Alsace, France, 2012 ($19; mevushal): No longer as restrained on the nose as it once was, this lovely wine offers classic citrus, flint, and floral aromatics followed on the palate with the fresh, racy tang of citrus, spice and herbs, with still enough of the acidity to keep it all together nicely, and now with additional bottle-age complexity to make it enjoyable even without food. Serve lightly chilled.
Also consider the other Abarbanel Alsatian wine:
Abarbanel, Lemminade, Gewurztraminer, Vin D'alsace, Old-Vine, 2015 ($23; non-mevushal): This is a beautiful, bright, vibrant, somewhat rounded yet refreshing and very slightly sweet Gewurtz with tingly acidity and wonderful aromas and flavors of white peach, lychee and wild flowers, with notes of ginger and cloves. Serve only slightly chilled with poultry, Asian cuisine or Cajun cooking.
And, because I mentioned them at the beginning and they really are fine choices for such an occasion:
Covenant, Red C, Rosé, Sonoma, 2016 ($35; non-mevushal; only available direct from the winery): This is really refreshing, light, dry, crisp rosé — a blend of Grenache, Syrah, Zinfandel, Merlot and a little Cabernet Sauvignon — offers flavors and aromas of strawberry, raspberry, sour cherry and pungent honeysuckle. Serve slightly chilled.
Hagafen Sauvignon Blanc Napa Valley 2016 ($27; mevushal): From vintage to vintage, this is invariably one of the most reliably beautiful, delicious, aromatic, fresh and refreshing kosher Sauvignon Blancs on the market, with soft yet crisp acidity balanced perfectly against floral and fruit notes — especially white peach, green apple, mango and kiwi, with mineral-rich citrus and citrus-peel characteristics on both the nose and sumptuous palate. Serve chilled. This food-friendly glass of sunshine is perfect to pair with crudités, salads, mild fish and chicken dishes as well as simply grilled fish — or even just on its own to brighten your mood. L' chaim!

A woman died in crash in a Montcalm County.
It happened last Wednesday morning at the intersection of Sidney Road and Mt. Hope Road in Crystal Township.
Troopers say a woman driving when they hit a truck driving through the intersection.
Sheryl Reinsmith, the passenger in the truck, was killed.
Both the driver and passenger of the other vehicle and the driver of the truck were taken to the hospital with injuries.
The cause of the accident remains under investigation.
Comedian Micah “Katt” Williams will have to undergo a year of anger management classes after pleading no contest Monday to a robbery charge stemming from a 2014 incident during which prosecutors say they and rap mogul Marion “Suge” Knight snatched a camera from a photographer.
Under the terms of the deal, Williams, 54, also received three years' probation when they entered the plea to second-degree robbery, according to a statement by the Los Angeles district attorney's office.The comedian had faced up to seven years in prison.
Prosecutors say Williams and Knight, who co-founded Death Row Records, chased a female celebrity photographer and snatched their camera outside of a Beverly Hills studio in September 2014.
Knight, who is still facing a murder trial in a separate case, has pleaded not guilty in both the murder and robbery cases.
Earlier this month, a judge set a trial date for January 2018 in the murder case. Knight, 51, is accused of barreling their red truck into two men in the parking lot of a Compton burger stand in late January 2015, killing 55-year-old Terry Carter. Footage from a security camera shows Knight — who says they acted in self-defense — plowing their truck into the men. Knight fled but later turned themselves in.
The robbery was part of a series of criminal charges levied against Williams in recent years. They were also charged with misdemeanor battery after getting into a fight with a woman at a Studio City hotel last July, and they were accused of disorderly conduct in Georgia months earlier after getting into an altercation with a teenager.
A spokesperson for the Los Angeles city attorney's office could not immediately comment on the battery charge.

Dozens of innocent people were left for dead or wounded — and the city was in a state of crisis.
But on Yonge St., there was a showdown between suspect Alek Minassian and Const. Ken Lam, who had some big life and death decisions to make.
The suspect in the van carnage had drawn something black in colour from their vest and pointing it at the seven-year-veteran.
Lam didn't flinch.
In fact they even went back into their car to turn off their siren. They then moved in on Minnasian, took them down, handcuffed them and got them to 32 Division where they were booked.
“Remarkable,” was the word Chief Mark Saunders used to describe Lam's efforts.
The chief talked about the “training” and the “de-escalation tactics taught” but admitted it's much different in a real situation. “The officer did a fantastic job,” said Saunders. “I applaud him.”
If they aren't at their best, who knows how this would have gone down. Police sources said one worry was the possibilty of what could have been in the back of that rental van?
And could that phone in the suspect's hands have been a detonator? No, but Lam had no way of knowing.
“There was potential for so much to happen,” said a senior officer. “This officer not only managed to not shoot the suspect but they also prevented other possible outcomes, including preventing a bullet ricochet.”
Toronto Police Association President Mike McCormack re-iterated the officer is a hero.
“He was very upset about the loss of life and all the people in hospital,” said McCormack. “He just felt they did their job and didn't want to be called a hero.”
But they are a hero.
Hopefully a medal for bravery is in Lam's future.

ASHBURN, Va. -- Washington Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall, coming off a torn ACL and still learning a new position, knew they didn't have many options. That's why it made sense for the 33-year-old to accept a pay cut to remain with Washington.
Hall said they recently accepted a reduced salary, cutting their base number almost in half. They had been scheduled to make $4.25 million this season but will now make $2.3 million, a source said. Redskins coach Jay Gruden has mentioned Hall's leadership as a reason they want to keep them around.
Under their previous contract, Hall would have counted $5.06 million against the cap. That would have been a hefty number for a player who has missed 31 combined games over the past three years.
Hall said they probably could have made more money elsewhere had they been healthy, but they know their injury situation -- they tore their ACL in Week 3 last season -- and the team's moves at safety provided them with no leverage.
The Redskins added safety D.J. Swearinger in free agency and moved Su'a Cravens to strong safety after the season. They also have veteran Will Blackmon at safety. Hall spent their first 12 seasons at corner before moving to safety midway through the 2015 season.
"There will come a point where I'm not able to play and I'm just too old or too slow or too banged up," Hall said. "While I can still play, I want to go out and play.
"I don't know where I fit in yet, and I don't know if they know where I fit in yet. But I know when I'm healthy, I can help us win."
: China's defence minister said on Tuesday that fighting the threat of terrorism is a top concern to be discussed by a Beijing-led group of Central Asian states at a meeting this week that highlights Chinese ambitions to dominate the Asian security agenda.Wei Fenghe told fellow defence officials from the eight-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Beijing that the group stood as a force for peace.Foreign ministers from the group were also meeting in Beijing on Tuesday and a head of state summit is planned for June in the Chinese port of Qingdao.Their two nations are rivals for Asian leadership and share a disputed and often tense Himalayan border.The focus on terrorism reflects China's hopes to use the grouping to stamp out threats of cross-border support for low-level separatist insurgencies particularly in the predominantly Turkic-speaking region of Xinjiang.Along with China and Russia, the SCO includes the Central Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan as well Pakistan and India.Cooperation among member nation defense ministries "has made important contributions to maintain peace in the region and the world," Wei said.Wei said the meeting would also discuss the South China Sea, where China has rapidly been consolidating its claim to virtually the entire strategic waterway through the construction of human-made island military bases.China has encouraged Central Asian countries to play a bigger role in regional affairs as part of the SCO. Apart from stepping up security cooperation, China has funneled significant economic investment into Central Asia, a critical hub in President Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road infrastructure initiative connecting the Eurasian continent.Beijing has also sought a bigger role in Afghanistan's political future, pushing for settlement talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.
Fugitive film director Roman Polanski has urged a judge to listen to their sex attack victim and drop the 40-year case against him.
Polsanski's lawyer Harland Braun has filed legal papers saying the Oscar-winning director believes the judge should respect the "wishes" of Samantha Geimer, who was 13 when they said Polanski plied them with champagne and a sedative during the assault.
Monday's filing comes after Ms Geimer, now 54, made their first personal plea to Los Angeles Superior Court for the case to be dropped as an "act of mercy" to them
Polanski, now 83, went on the run, having admitted a lesser charge of having unlawful sex with the girl during a photoshoot at Jack Nicholson's Hollywood Hills home in 1977.
Mr Braun said in the document: "Mr Polanski believes the court should respect the wishes of Ms Geimer as they stated in court.
"Mr Polanski hopes the court will understand why they are very sceptical that they will be treated fairly and hopes this court will prove them incorrect."
The filing intends to add pressure to Judge Scott Gordon, who is writing a response to Ms Geimer's motion to dismiss the case on Friday.
Ms Geimer, who reportedly received a payout of more than half a million dollars in 1993 after they sued Polanski, said they believe they have served their time after spending 42 days in jail.
They told the court: "I would implore you to consider taking action to finally put this issue to close as an act of mercy to myself and my family.
"A 40-year sentence has been imposed on the victim of the crime as well as the perpetrator."
Deputy district attorney Michele Hanisee made the case that their suffering had been extended because of Polanski's refusal to attend the court for sentencing.
Polanski, who won the best director Oscar for The Pianist, fled in 1978, fearing that a judge would extend their sentence.
Nicholson was not at home at the time of the offence and prosecutors dropped charges of rape and sodomy against Polanski, who is currently free to travel France, Switzerland and Poland.

U2 have revealed a heart-wrenching new short film to coincide with the band's latest single, “You're the Best Thing About Me.”

The documentary about love and separation features a newlywed military couple, high school sweethearts, a Syrian refugee family in Greece and a young couple from Mexico City. The film follows each couple for the final 24 hours they are together before one partner has to leave.
“It's a love song,” explained director Tatia Pilieva of the film. “What's interesting is not the bringing people together; it's the separation.”
Pilieva first came to prominence for their 2014 film First Kiss, where they invited 20 strangers to kiss for the first time on camera. After generating millions of views, it went on to win a Gold Lion at Cannes.
“The key for me is that when these people are saying goodbye, they are still very much in love,” they said of their U2 film. “I didn't want to film a bunch of breakups. I didn't want to put that into the world. I wanted to put out something positive. Yes, it's positively heartbreaking, but there's love all over it.”
Mumbai: The long pending Transgender Welfare Board (TWB) will finally see light of the day with the Maharashtra government making a provision of Rs 5 crore for welfare of the community.
Minister of State for Social Justice Dilip Kamble told PTI that the Board will be set up in a month's time. It will look after education, employment, housing, and health schemes for transgenders and protect their Constitutional and human rights.
Maharashtra will be the first such state to have such a Board, the minister said.
The Transgender Welfare Board was first conceptualised in 2014 by the previous government.
The issue of setting up such a board for implementing welfare schemes for transgenders and protecting their rights was mentioned in the third women's policy of the state government, accepted by the cabinet in 2013.
The policy promised various welfare measures for working women in the state.
State women and child welfare ministry was entrusted with the responsibility of setting up the board which prepared the broad framework for implementing education, health, and housing policies as well as generating employment opportunities for transgenders.
"Since welfare schemes for transgenders were implemented by Union social justice ministry, all work related to setting up of the board and implementing welfare schemes for the community was transferred to the state Social Justice department on 3 October, 2017, and an amount of Rs 5 crore was set aside for the purpose," they said.
The procedure of establishing the TWB took a backseat after the new government assumed charge in October 2014.
Women and Child Welfare Minister Pankaja Munde tried to revive the process and held meetings with all stake-holders on the issue.
Early last year, Munde had said there were some five Central schemes for the welfare of transgenders and that their ministry will work towards bringing the community members into the mainstream.
"We want them to be treated honourably and see that they benefit from the government's welfare schemes," they had said.

Two people were hurt after a crane collapsed on a pair of homes Wednesday in southern Florida, according to police.
Just after 3:30 p.m., a crane replacing power poles lost stability and landed on two houses in Lauderhill, Florida, about 30 miles north of Miami, according to Lauderhill Fire Rescue Assistant Chief Jeff Levy.
One house suffered "major" roof and structural damage, and a second house was also damaged to a lesser degree, Levy said.
A man inside the first home was taken to the hospital minor injuries. Levy said they were alert and described them as "very lucky to be alive." The crane operator was also treated on the scene for minor injuries and released.
Jarring images from the scene in Lauderhill, Fl. show the arm of a toppled crane splintering the roof of one house and cutting through multiple backyards.

Whereas we were witnessing a very apparent slide in the rule of law, morality and general lack of trust at all levels - individual, institutional, national and international - but some of the recent developments in our beloved country are so alarming that any discerning mind cannot escape the impact of harsh and ominous writings on the wall.
At the regional level also, the continued distrust among neighbours seems to further increase rather than shrink.
One was horrified to learn that an elected member of an assembly along with their supporters captured a control mechanism of a canal and forcibly opened the gates to divert the flow of water in their desired direction.
The muted, rather ‘no reaction', by the sitting government was rather appalling.
Then we heard of people under the patronage of certain political leaders attacked grid stations, destroying public assets under the garb of a protest against load shedding.
The level of intellect of the mob can be evaluated by observing that they were destroying the same that they were demanding.
And surely we all heard of the dignitary who, when caught up in a traffic jam, could think of nothing else but unleashing their guards on poor hapless commutators who were otherwise victims of the same logjam.
Raise the level and watch with amazement and disgust, what institutions are doing to each other, with no umpires and only a few sane voices suggesting calm and rapprochement.
Politics is being played on the carcasses of dying systems and the media is actively taking sides, further opening the oozing wounds rather than applying a healing balm.
And this time no institution seems to be strong enough or willing even to put in a word of advice.
Free for all, incessant bloody infighting, spreading in all directions, with apparently no grand objectives but petty selfish interests, individual or institutional.
Look at the borders, East, Northwest or Southwest, enemies growling and spitting hateful allegations, friends not very satisfied, people who banked on you (Kashmiris) feeling abandoned.
And, the enemy is not only active along borders but operating right into the heartland of our beloved land, if Kalbhushan and Ehsanullah Ehsan's revelations are of any consequence.
Every second day there are reports of arson in important factories, undermining the economy, as if piling up of unprecedented debt was not enough to break our back.
If whatever narrated above, as a birdseye view, is exaggerated towards gloom, then we can take a sigh of relief and reject all this as a figment of the imagination.
But if the picture painted is nearly correct, then my dear fellow countrymen (and of course countrywomen), we are in some serious trouble, and this time there seems to be no self-correction or external nudging to put us back on track.
So are we doomed to be condemned by forces of nature as a useless and spineless nation with no goodness left that is worthy of sparing us this time? Is the situation hopeless?
All those who never give up (I humbly count myself one of those) and always see the brighter side, now will have to rise and get counted.
Writing, making sermons and drawing room discussions will pay no more.
If we really want good things to happen and course of the future corrected, we need to act.
Nothing happens automatically; it is not even nature's promise.
We need to organise ourselves and either put our weight with some good ongoing political movement or create a new one with some specific objectives and not merely grabbing of power.
But power will have to be acquired through public mobilisation and politically correct procedures.
Provision of justice, education, merit and health facilities should be the basic slogan with a detailed manifesto laying down how each of these will be provided in this overpopulated and chaotic Country.
Hardcore economists and foreign policy experts will have to work overtime in cooperative groups to steer us clear of the present muck.
Armed Forces will have to be ready for further sacrifices as we pass through some destabilizing times.
Whatever remedies experts of sociology, politics and strategy proffer, one thing is crystal clear: immediate course correction is needed.
It is already very late.

The Google Home Max, which was announced along with the Google Home Mini at the Made By Google event in October this year, is available just in time for Christmas. The Google Home range of devices are smarthome speakers in an emerging category that includes the Amazon Echo powered by Alexa, Microsoft's Invoke powered by Cortana, and the upcoming HomePod by Apple powered by Siri. According to Gartner, the category is expected to expand to a $2.1 billion market by 2020.
One of the most interesting features in the Google Home Max is that the AI integrated with the speaker balances out the sound taking into consideration the environment. Speakers placed in the middle of the room, outdoor, or against the wall all sound different because of the way the sound waves interact with the surrounding surfaces. The Google Home Max automatically tunes itself in real-time to provide a balanced sound no matter where it is located. The balancing occurs continuously, and the technology works even when a user is moving the speaker from one spot to another. Two Google Home Max speakers can be paired in a stereo configuration.
The Google Home Max delivers a premium audio experience with two 4.5-inch high excursion woofers that are together twenty times more powerful than the Google Home. The speaker provides access to popular music streaming services such as Spotify, Play Music and Pandora. Users can cast to the speakers from their Android smartphones through the built-in Chromecast. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth and a 3.5 mm audio jack.
The Google Home Max supports voice commands for interfacing with all the supported music streaming services. Users can request particular playlists on Spotify, adjust the volume, or ask Google Assistant to play a song even if the users remember only a portion of the lyrics.
The far field microphone on the device allows Google Home Max to pick up voice commands from distant corners of the room. Users can also interface with other connected smart home devices through voice commands on the Google Home Max. Supported IoT devices include products by Nest, Philips, LG, Wemo, Logitech, Honeywell, D-Link and Hive.
A single Google Home Max speaker is available for $399 on the Google Store, as well as online storefronts of Verizon, Best Buy and Walmart. A few Verizon retail outlets will also be having the Google Home Max in stock, and the speakers will be available in pop up Made By Google stores in New York and Los Angeles. India launch dates have not been announced yet.
Meridian softball earns sweep over Dow
SANFORD — Meridian's softball team is still fine tuning, but coach Jamie Smith is pretty happy with where the Mustangs are following Tuesday's doubleheader sweep of Dow High.
“We're behind, but we're all in the same boat,” Smith said of their team's progress. “We usually have a lot more games in by now, so we're still working out a few issues but it's coming along.”
The Mustangs didn't have any issues hitting on Tuesday, picking up 12-0 and 12-3 victories over the visiting Chargers. The wins lift Meridian to 4-3 on the season, while Dow falls to 0-10.
Makayla Kent led the Mustangs offense in the first game with two hits, including a three-run homer. Abby Person also had two hits and three RBIs, while Haley Maynard and Karley Kent added two hits apiece.
Peyton Grice earned the complete-game victory, allowing three hits and striking out six in five innings, while Dow's Riley Davis took the loss. Shayna Draves had a double for the Chargers.
Ally Sutton had two hits, including a triple, and two RBIs to lead Meridian's offense in the second game. Mya Hall and Kent each added two hits in the win.
Taryn Weisenberger threw a complete-game, allowing four hits and striking out six in seven innings, to earn the win the second game. Davis went six innings in taking the loss for Dow.
Draves had two hits to lead the Chargers' offense.
“We open conference play on Thursday, so we're just trying to work on what we can,” Smith noted. “We hit the ball well (Tuesday), but we're still not as aggressive as I would like to see. We're still taking too many good pitches.”
Dow returns to action on Thursday hosting Mount Pleasant, while Meridian opens Jack Pine Conference play at Gladwin on Thursday.
A group of physicians and local gay men's health organizations are calling on B.C.'s Premier and Health Minister to approve an HIV prevention drug for gay men to be funded by PharmaCare.
“We're asking for whatever induvial deductibles would be, so that would still be maintained. But the problem is that deductibles aren't able to be applied to this because it's not on the list of approved medications,” said Jody Jollimer with Vancouver's Community-Based Research Centre for Gay Men's Health.

The drug is called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis also known as PrEP, can cost anywhere from $500 to $1,000 a month and it's only accepted by some extended health plans.
“We know that gay men are going to great lengths to get access this prevents medication. They are getting generics, they are getting mail boxes across the border, they are getting it shipped there and crossing the border,” said Jollimer.

The drug was made available to B.C. last year and is available by prescription, but Jollimer said because of cost, only the most privileged can access it.
So far no comment from the Health Ministry.

London: Chelsea forward Alvaro Morata will miss the Premier League game at Huddersfield Town on Tuesday with a back problem but Danny Drinkwater has returned to the squad after illness, coach Antonio Conte said on Monday.
“Drinkwater started to train on Sunday after their fever,” said the Italian, with the former Leicester City midfielder having missed Saturday's 1-0 defeat at West Ham United.
“He's come with us, but for sure after three or four days with a fever, their physical condition is not at the top level,” Conte said on Chelsea's website (www.chelseafc.com).
“David Luiz is continuing to recover from their knee problem. And Morata is out.  They are a bit tired and they have a problem in their back,” Conte added of the Spaniard, who has 10 goals this season.
The Italian, whose team won the title last season without the demands of European football, were drawn on Monday to face Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 stage.
“I think we have to face the reality and will try to do our best,” said Conte, whose players are already tired having featured in a pre-season tour of Asia before the season began.
”If I stay here to complain it is not the right way.
“For sure it is difficult because to face a game every three days is not simple, especially if your squad is not big, but at the same time we have to face this situation,” they were quoted as saying by The Independent.
“We have to try to do our best. For sure some players can be tired, that's normal because some players are playing from this summer and our tours in China and Singapore.”
Conte is struggling to get consistent results in the Premier League this term and their third-placed side are 14 points adrift of leaders Manchester City after 16 games.
Huddersfield have won three of their last four games at the John Smith's Stadium, with Manchester City only securing a 2-1 win with a late goal, and Conte expects a tough test.
“We are facing a team in a good moment of form. In the last game they played a great game against Brighton,” they said referring to Saturday's 2-0 home win.
”We must pay great attention to the counter-attack because they have fast players.
“They are in a good moment of form and we must be very good to be more clinical in this game, because in the recent period we weren't clinical.”
Pakistan's banned militant outfit Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which recently launched a political party, on Sunday fielded a candidate against ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif's wife Kulsoom for the seat which fell vacant after the former premier's disqualification.Headed by Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed, Jamaat-ud- Dawa (JuD) announced the formation of 'Milli Muslim League' (MML) in Islamabad on August 7 following weeks of campaign in Punjab's provincial capital Lahore.Ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMN-L) party members Asif Kirmani and Captain Safdar filed the nomination papers of Kulsoom, who is in their late 60s, for the upcoming by-poll for the NA-120 seat at the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) Lahore office on Friday.The National Assembly seat fell vacant after 67-year-old Sharif was disqualified by the Supreme Court in the Panama Papers case on July 28."We will protect the people's especially women rights. Khidmat (service) committees will be set up at union council level to ensure serving the people at the grass roots," said MML President Saifullah Khalid at a large rally 'Istehkaam Pakistan Conference' held on the Mall Road in Lahore.Khalid said their party would provide an "honest" leadership to the country and also announced launching of a movement to revive Pakistan's ideology."We will defend Pakistan's ideology at any cost. We will also defend the constitution of 1973. The MML will promote unity in the country," they said, adding that supporting Kashmir's freedom struggle "is part of our faith"."We will defend Pakistan's ideology. Our rulers are incapable to rule," said Qari Yaqoub Sheikh, MML's candidate for the vacated seat.As the MML is yet to be registered with the ECP, Sheikh has filed their nomination papers as an independent candidate.Sheikh said the process of the MML registration as a political party was under way before the ECP.Former federal information minister Muhammad Ali Durrani said at the rally that the "MML is the party that wil guard Pakistan's ideology".He said the MML would eliminate Prime Minister Narendra Modi's friends from Pakistan.Head Political Affair and acting chief of JuD Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki said Politics of MML was "based on unity, and on texts of Quaid and thoughts of Iqbal".The JuD is believed to be a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group behind the 2008 deadly attacks in Mumbai in which 166 people were killed by 10 terrorists who came from Pakistan.

BOSTON -- Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens summed up Game 5 succinctly in media availability, more than an hour before tip.
"Obviously," Stevens said, "we're better with Marcus Smart."
Considerably better. Prior to Tuesday's game, the Celtics had been the second-worst team in the playoffs by defensive rating. On Tuesday, Boston drowned the Milwaukee Bucks slowly in a 92-87 slugfest to take a 3-2 series lead, getting big defensive performances from Smart, Semi Ojeleye and several others.
The Celtics used their typical first-half lull right away, falling behind 6-1 on an abysmal start from the field. But Ojeleye -- starting in place of Aron Baynes -- knocked down a corner 3-pointer that got the Celtics' offense rolling. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown continued to show very quick development, both scoring in multiple ways and finding teammates off the dribble.
But the biggest spark (of course) came from Smart, who checked in for the first time with about four minutes left in the first quarter. Immediately, Smart forced a turnover by diving on the floor with no regard for their splint-secured thumb, and shortly afterward they blocked a dunk attempt by Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Celtics turned defense into offense and took a 23-15 lead after one quarter.
The Celtics' energy continued to propel them in the second -- the lead ballooned as high as 16 on wide-open threes by Tatum and Brown before the Bucks closed it back to 48-37 at the break.
The third quarter got feisty. Eric Bledsoe tried to introduce themselves to Terry Rozier by bodychecking them in the early going, earning a flagrant 1 and drawing a technical on Rozier when they responded with a shove of their own.
On the next possession, Rozier drilled a 3-pointer over Bledsoe, pushing Boston's lead to 16.
The Bucks began to chip away. Shabazz Muhammad entered the game and immediately started scoring. The Celtics' offense went cold, and the Bucks pulled as close as four with four minutes remaining in the period.
Then Smart returned and helped restore order. The Celtics found Brown for a corner triple, and both Horford and Smart earned trips to the line before Brown canned another triple to push the lead back to 11. Smart's lob to Horford at the end of the period helped the Celtics maintain a 72-61 lead going into the fourth.
The Celtics, however, stayed at 72 for the first three minutes of the fourth, while Milwaukee closed the gap. A 7-0 run by the Bucks cut the lead to four, forcing Stevens to take a timeout.
Boston never pulled away, but they locked the Bucks in place down the stretch -- getting big stops and just enough timely baskets for the win. Appropriately, it was Smart's hustle that closed the game: With 28.1 seconds left and the Celtics leading by five, Smart dove on the floor to save a possession and slipped a pass along the ground to Horford for a layup. From there, the Celtics made free throws to close the game.
Horford led the Celtics with 22 points and 14 rebounds. Rozier added 16.
Middleton dropped 23 points for Milwaukee. An exhausted-looking Antetokounmpo posted 16 on 5-for-10. The Bucks shot 36.8 percent from the field.
Game 6 will take place on Thursday in Milwaukee.
The fastest man in the world is trying their talents again on the soccer pitch.
Usain Bolt will work out this week with Norwegian professional club Stromsgodset, the team announced, as they prepare for a charity game in Manchester, England, in June.
Players clapped as they welcomed Bolt as a surprise guest in their morning meeting. The Olympic champion walked into the room wearing a jersey with the number 9.58, their world record in seconds for the 100-meter dash.
“I got a few players who are fast, quick,” Stromsgodset director of football Jostein Flo said. “I guess we'll find out during the next couple of days.”
Bolt, 31, retired from running in 2017 but says he's serious about giving professional soccer a shot. Already this year the Jamaican sprinter has trained with German club Borussia Dortmund and South African club Sundowns.
Imagine Bolt, with that world-class speed and 6-foot-5 frame, on a soccer pitch somewhere attacking the goal.
“It's something I really want to do and pursue,” they told Stromsgodset in a Facebook Live video. “That's why I'm really training to make sure when I get to this charity match, I'm at my best and focused. And hopefully everything will come together, a team will see what kind of talent I have. You never know, I might get picked up. We'll see what happens.”

The Carolina Flaggers, a southern heritage group that displays the Confederate.
Flag, was forbidden from marching in the Summerville Christmas Parade on Sunday.
"This was by far the most unfair, and I feel like it was disrespectful," Carolina Flaggers President Braxton Spivey said.
After parade organizers gave Spivey's group permission to march, some people weren't happy. Summerville DREAM, which gave the approval, sent out a note acknowledging people's concerns.
Some even planned to silently protest at the event today. But they quickly realized there was no need.
"I don't know what decision was made, but whoever made the decision, I applaud them,” Summerville resident Louis Smith said.
But the Carolina Flaggers were not as happy.
"We never expected them to wait until we were in the middle of a thousand people to make that decision," Carolina Flaggers spokesperson James Bessinger said.
Summerville DREAM said in a statement that the Flaggers were removed because they didn't follow all of their guidelines.
DREAM didn't specify which guidelines the Flaggers violated, but a video taken by a Flagger shows they were given the opportunity to change the number of Confederate flags they displayed.
"I said you could have one confederate flag, you have representations of it on multiple flags," a video said.
The Flaggers say they substituted the two flags like DREAM asked. After that, they say no one said anything else.
"They had plenty of time to pull us out of the parade before we ended up at Main Street, so I'm a little disappointed with how they handled it," Bessenger said.
The Carolina Flaggers said they plan to involve their legal team and possibly sue Summerville DREAM.

Washington: The Trump administration is planning to end allowing spouses of H1-B visa holders to work legally in the US, a top federal agency official has told lawmakers, a move that could have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of Indians.The move to end the Obama-era rule could have an impact on more than 70,000 H-4 visas holders, who have work permits.H-4 is issued to the spouse of H-1B visa holders, a significantly large number of whom are high-skilled professionals from India. They had obtained work permits under a special order issued by the previous Obama administration.Indian-Americans were a major beneficiary of this provision. More than 100,000 H-4 visa holders have been beneficiary of this rule.A 2015 rule issued by the Obama administration allows work permits for spouses who otherwise could not be employed while H-1B visa holders seek permanent resident status -- a process that can take a decade or longer.The Trump administration is planning to terminate this provision. A former communication is expected to be made later this summer, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Francis Cissna said in a letter to Senator Chuck Grassley."Our plans include proposing regulatory changes to remove H-4 dependent spouses from the class of aliens eligible for employment authorisation, thereby reversing the 2015 final rule that granted such eligibility," Cissna said.He said such action would comport with the executive order requirement to "propose new rules and issue new guidance, to supersede or revise previous rules and guidance if appropriate, to protect the interests of United States workers in the administration of our immigration system ... "As with other revisions to regulations, the public will have an opportunity to provide feedback during a notice and comment period, Cissna said.According to a recent study by the Migration Policy Institute, the US has issued employment authorisation documents to more than 71,000 spouses of H-1B visa holders, over 90 percent of whom are Indians."As of June 2017, USCIS had granted 71,287 initial (versus renewal) employment authorisation documents to H-4 spouses," the study which was released last week said.Of those H-4 spouses with work authorisation as of early 2017, a total of 94 percent were women, and the vast majority, 93 percent, were from India, while four percent were from China, the study said
Theresa May is to hold talks with the Northern Ireland political parties amid warnings an expected deal with the Democratic Unionists (DUP) to prop up their minority government will undermine the peace process.
The Prime Minister will meet separately with representatives of Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and the Alliance Party - as well as the DUP - in Downing Street in an attempt to allay growing concerns.
It follows warnings - including from former prime minister Sir John Major - that the Government will compromise its stated impartiality in the province if it enters a confidence and supply deal with the DUP at Westminster.
The nationalist Sinn Fein and SDLP and the cross-community Alliance have all made clear Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire cannot chair the ongoing process to restore power-sharing at Stormont due to the perceived conflict of interest.
The 1998 Good Friday Agreement - also referred to as the Belfast Agreement - commits the UK and Irish Governments to demonstrate "rigorous impartiality" in their dealings with the different political traditions in Northern Ireland.
Sinn Fein's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill said: "I will be making it very clear that any deal between the Tories and the DUP cannot be allowed to undermine the Good Friday and subsequent agreements."
Mr Brokenshire insisted the Government would honour its commitments in the Good Friday Agreement and warned that time was running out if power-sharing was to be restored and a return to direct rule from Westminster avoided.
"The UK Government is offering whatever support we can, working alongside the Irish government, as appropriate, honouring our respective commitments in the Belfast Agreement to serve the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland," they said.
"There is very little time left. An agreement to restore devolved power-sharing government in Stormont must be reached by the 29 June deadline.
"Ultimately, I think the parties understand people voted in the March Assembly elections for a strong voice at Stormont.
"Northern Ireland's political leaders now have it in their hands to take control and shape a brighter future for everyone in Northern Ireland."
Meanwhile, talks are continuing between the DUP and Conservatives, to secure the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in steering government business, including crucial measures on Brexit, through the Commons.
It is thought that an announcement on an agreement will be delayed as a result of the Grenfell Tower tragedy - and may not come until next week.
Ministers have already said that the Queen's Speech may have to be set back from its scheduled date of next Monday June 19, because of the ongoing negotiations.
DUP leader Arlene Foster, who met Mrs May in No 10 on Tuesday, is understood to have returned to Northern Ireland leaving their deputy Nigel Dodds to represent the party at Thursday's meeting.
The proposed deal would see the DUP back the Conservatives in votes on the Budget and on any confidence motion while other matters would be negotiated on an issue-by-issue basis.
Harvey Weinstein indicted in New York rape case
Harvey Weinstein was indicted Wednesday on rape and criminal sex act charges, furthering the first criminal case to arise from a slate of sexual misconduct allegations against the former movie mogul.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said the indictment brings Weinstein “another step closer to accountability.”
The announcement came hours after Weinstein's lawyers said he'd decline to testify before the grand jury because there wasn't enough time to prepare them and “political pressure” made an indictment unavoidable.
A statement issued through a Weinstein spokesperson said the 66-year-old film producer, who has denied the allegations, learned of the specific charges and the accusers' identities only after turning themselves on Friday. With a deadline set for Wednesday afternoon to testify or not, their request for more time was denied, the statement said.
“Finally, Mr. Weinstein's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr. Weinstein's personal testimony might be, an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr. Weinstein,” the statement said, referring to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.
Vance said in a statement that the Weinstein camp's “recent assault on the integrity of the survivors and the legal process is predictable.”
“We are confident that when the jury hears the evidence, it will reject these attacks out of hand,” Vance said.
Weinstein was charged Friday with rape and criminal sex act charges involving two women in New York, as a grand jury continued hearing evidence in the case; the panel has been at work for weeks. Defendants have the right to testify in a grand jury's secret proceedings but often don't, for various reasons.
Weinstein faces rape and criminal sex act charges involving two women in New York. Dozens more women have accused them of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault in various locales.
They have denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, and their lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said Tuesday that Weinstein was “confident he's going to clear their name” in the New York prosecution.
Brafman called the rape allegation “absurd,” saying that the accuser and Weinstein had a decade-long, consensual sexual relationship that continued after the alleged 2013 attack.
The woman, who hasn't been identified publicly, told investigators Weinstein confined them in a hotel room and raped them
The other accuser in the case, former actor Lucia Evans, has gone public with their account of Weinstein forcing them to perform oral sex at their office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly.
Vance, a Democrat, came under public pressure from women's groups to prosecute Weinstein after declining to do so in 2015, when an Italian model went to police to say Weinstein had groped them during a meeting.
Police set up a sting in which the woman recorded themselves confronting Weinstein and them apologizing for their conduct. But Vance decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo, also a Democrat, ordered the state attorney general to investigate how Vance handled that matter.

London: Antonio Conte dismissed speculation surrounding their future at Premier League champions Chelsea, saying that they plan to see out their contract and is focused on their job.
Conte, who guided Chelsea to the league title in their first season, has struggled to extract the same level of ruthlessness from the London club in their second campaign in charge.
Chelsea is fourth in the table with 50 points, 18 points behind leaders Manchester City, and the Italian manager admitted the club were in danger of missing out on a Champions League place next season after a 3-0 defeat by Bournemouth in midweek.
"The only thing I can tell you now is that I have 18 months left on my contract at Chelsea and my will and my desire is to stay here and continue my work," Conte said ahead of Monday's league clash at 11th-placed Watford.
The Italian has suggested this season that their squad is too small to be playing Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League competitions and that they have little control over signing new players in the transfer window.
British media reports have said Conte's relationship with team owner Roman Abramovich has become strained, particularly over reinforcements to the squad but the manager said they were not interested in talk of them being sacked.
"From the start of the season, and since the defeat against Bournemouth, there's been a lot of speculation about me being sacked," Conte added.
"But I'm not interested in this. I'm only focused on working with my team and trying my best for the team.
"I trust in my work. This is the only way I work and that brought me to be one of the best coaches. Only trusting in my work and in my job. I continue in this way because I think this has made me become one of the best."
Kyoto University Professor Hiroyuki Yano, who is leading the research into using wood pulp fibers to make lighter auto parts, poses for a photograph at their laboratory in Kyoto, Japan July 25, 2017.
KYOTO, Japan (Reuters) - The global push among carmakers to make ever lighter vehicles is leading some auto suppliers in Japan to turn to what seems like an unlikely substitute for steel - wood.
Japanese researchers and auto component makers say a material made from wood pulp weighs just one fifth of steel and can be five times stronger.
The material - cellulose nanofibers - could become a viable alternative to steel in the decades ahead, they say, although it faces competition from carbon-based materials, and remains a long way from being commercially viable.
Reducing the weight of a vehicle will be critical as manufacturers move to bring electric cars into the mainstream. Batteries are an expensive but vital component, so a reduction in car weight will mean fewer batteries will be needed to power the vehicle, saving on costs.
"Lightweighting is a constant issue for us," said Masanori Matsushiro, a project manager overseeing body design at Toyota Motor Corp.
"But we also have to resolve the issue of high manufacturing costs before we see an increased use of new, lighter-weight materials in mass-volume cars."
Researchers at Kyoto University and major parts suppliers such as Denso Corp, Toyota's biggest supplier, and DaikyoNishikawa Corp, are working with plastics incorporated with cellulose nanofibers - made by breaking down wood pulp fibers into several hundredths of a micron (one thousandth of a millimeter).
Cellulose nanofibers have been used in a variety of products ranging from ink to transparent displays, but their potential use in cars has been enabled by the "Kyoto Process", under which chemically treated wood fibers are kneaded into plastics while simultaneously being broken down into nanofibers, slashing the cost of production to roughly one-fifth that of other processes.
"This is the lowest-cost, highest-performance application for cellulose nanofibers, and that's why we're focusing on its use in auto and aircraft parts," Kyoto University Professor Hiroaki Yano, who is leading the research, told Reuters in an interview.
The university, along with auto parts suppliers, are currently developing a prototype car using cellulose nanofiber-based parts to be completed in 2020.
Kyoto University Professor Hiroyuki Yano, who is leading the research into using wood pulp fibers to make lighter auto parts, shows wood chips (L) and fibers which are chemically treated before they are converted into cellulose nanofibers as they are kneaded into plastics and formed into pellets, at their laboratory in Tokyo, Japan July 25, 2017.

"We've been using plastics as a replacement for steel, and we're hoping that cellulose nanofibers will widen the possibilities toward that goal," said Yukihiko Ishino, a spokesperson at DaikyoNishikawa, which counts Toyota Motor Corp and Mazda Motor Corp among its customers.
Automakers are also using other lightweight substitutes. BMW uses carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) for its i3 compact electric car as well as for its 7 series, while high-tensile steel and aluminum alloys are currently the most widely used lightweight options because they are cheaper and recyclable.
"SPRUCE GOOSE"
Yano said they were inspired in their research by a photo of the "Spruce Goose", a cargo plane made almost entirely of wood in 1947 by U.S. billionaire entrepreneur Howard Hughes. At the time, it was the world's largest aircraft.
"I thought that if Howard Hughes could find a way to use wood to build a massive plane, why not use wood to make a material that was as strong as steel," they said.
The cost of mass producing a kilogram of cellulose nanofiber is currently around 1,000 yen ($9).
Yano aims to halve that cost by 2030, which they say will make it an economically viable product, since it would be combined with plastic, and so competitive against high tensile steel and aluminum alloys, which currently cost around $2 per kg.
Industry experts anticipate that carbon fiber prices will fall to around $10 per kg by 2025.
Analysts say high-tensile steel and aluminum will be the more popular alternative for many years to come, considering parts makers would need to overhaul production lines and figure out ways to fasten new materials like cellulose nanofiber onto other car parts.
Anthony Vicari, an applied materials analyst at Lux Research in Boston, said it "would be a big deal" though if Yano's projections prove to be correct.
But for now, it remains "a very big 'if'", they said.

NEW DELHI - An Indian police officer hailed as a hero for protecting a Muslim man from being lynched by a mob has begun receiving death threats, police say.
Gagandeep Singh, an officer in the northern state of Uttarakhand, shot to fame after a video of them saving a Muslim man from a Hindu mob went viral on social media last week.
The man was visiting a temple with their Hindu girlfriend. The mob surrounded the man and tried to attack, accusing them of “love jihad”.
The term has been popularised by radical Hindu fringe groups who accuse Muslim men of participating in a conspiracy to turn Hindu women from their religion by seducing them.
When the video was first shared online, many called Mr Singh a “role model” for all Indians, and their story was carried in many mainstream Indian publications.
“I was just doing my duty. Even if I was not in uniform, I would have done the same thing and every Indian should do the same,” they were quoted as saying by local media.
However it did not take long for people to criticise Mr Singh's actions, accusing them of defending “indecent behaviour”.
Police officials working with them have said that they have received threats to their life, and has been sent on leave.
Some politicians have also publicly justified the actions of the mob.
“It's wrong when these people (Muslim men) bring Hindu girls to our places of worship despite knowing it's a temple and it's pious,” Rakesh Nainwal, an MLA of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), told BBC Punjabi's Sunil Kataria.
Another BJP MLA Rajkumar Thukral told the ANI News Agency that this was an attempt by the man to hurt the feelings of the Hindu community.
“We don't go to mosques because we don't have the right to go there,” they added.
“Then why did these men go to our temple with an intention to destroy the Hindu culture?”
But for some residents of Ramnagar district, where the incident took place, the turn of events has been disturbing.
“When a boy and a girl go somewhere together by choice, then how can these right-wing groups call it a case of “love jihad” and attack them?” Ajit Sahni, a resident of Ramnagar, told BBC Punjabi.
MEDIA personality and socialite, Ruvheneko Parirenyatwa, has dismissed claims that they were using facilities belonging to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals as a studio for their new online programme, in a suspected case of nepotism and abuse of State resources.
BY LORRAINE MUROMO
Ruvheneko, who is the daughter of Health and Child Care minister David Parirenyatwa, told NewsDay on Monday that they were using the University of Zimbabwe's multimedia resource centre at the hospital as “a paying client”, although they did not disclose how much they were paying.
“I am using the studios at the multimedia resource centre, which is part of the University of Zimbabwe. Anyone can pay to use the studios at the multimedia resource centre all year round,” they said.
“I am a paying client. The studios do not fall under Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals and neither do they fall under the Ministry of Health and Child Care.”
Ruvheneko said they found it disturbing that people were making up stories about them without verifying the facts.
The vivacious television and radio personality resigned from their post of programmes manager at ZiFM Stereo radio station late last year and attributed their departure to political reasons.
She, however, indicated that their departure from the institution was not the end of their career, but the beginning of better and positive prospects, as they soon embarked on their own projects.
“Leaving ZiFM Stereo is not the end of my world or my career. God cannot be done with me yet. The station itself will never be the same without the many of us who have left, but who is to say that ‘change' does not come with ‘better!' It is positive and wise to know when to move on and let go. Timing is everything,” they said.

ALTON — Menopause is a larger issue for women than it once was. And the reason is simple.
Life expectancy has increased by leaps and bounds. The average woman lived to be only 42 as recently as 150 years ago, but average female life expectancy is now 81. As a result, most women spend a third of their lives post-menopause, with 30 million women in America now in that stage of life.
To confront many of the problems women face, Alton Memorial Hospital will host Menopause Mania at 6 p.m. Wednesday, April 4, in the AMH café meeting rooms. The event will feature presentations by Dr. Geoffrey Turner, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the hospital, as well as Dr. Katie Drake Sherer, a chiropractor and nutritionist in Godfrey.
For more information or to register for this free event, call (800) 392-0936.
“Women today are often exposed to a lot of bad information when it comes to menopause,” Turner said. “There are more ways to try and deal with menopausal symptoms than items on the Cheesecake Factory's menu! We will try to get everyone good information about menopause and peri-menopause (the early onset of menopause) that will enable them to make quality choices when it comes to their health care.”
“I'll be presenting on how menopause affects digestion, weight gain and blood sugar,” Drake Sherer said. “We'll offer tips and ideas on what to eat to reduce symptoms and maintain a normal body weight, or lose weight if needed.”
Menopause Mania will also feature a fashion show, refreshments, giveaways, plus coupons to shop at Miss Eunice's Hat Box — the AMH gift shop. Valet service will be offered for visitors at the valet entrance of the hospital's Duncan Wing.

LAHORE-Parkha Ijaz of Defence Raya exhibited unmatched quality golfing skills and defied scorching heat to win the ladies title of the 37th Punjab Open Golf Championship here at Defence Raya Club on Tuesday.
Parkha showcased excellent golfing skills, shot making and accuracy which helped them to claim a two rounds aggregate score of (72+72) 144, level par. Over the past three decades, this kind of performance has not been forthcoming from the golfing efforts of a lady. Them awesome performance brings glee and gladness for all the stakeholders in golf which includes Pakistan Golf Federation and Punjab Golf, the Defence Raya Golf Club and even the sponsors. Hopefully they can be trained and groomed further to perform at the international level.
During the course of this championship, another notable one is the petite Humna Amjad of Kamra Golf Club. This teenager had rounds of 86 on the first day and then a very impressive 74 on the second day giving them a total aggregate of 159, and this effort fetched their runner-up position. Third gross position went to Ghazala Yasmin and their score also was 159 but they had to concede the runners-up slot to Humna, as they had a better score in the second round.
As for the men's events, M Shabbir of Islamabad Golf Club and an equally capable Matloob Ahmed of Garrison Golf Club and slightly less established one, Ashafaq Ahmed of Airmen Golf Club were able to sparkle and appear much above the over 97 other fierce contesting ones. For Shabbir, the overwhelming round of six under par 66 was usual stuff, but for Matloob the score of 69 was less and same to Ashfaq's. M Munir (Islamabad) and Anser Mehmood (Mangla) bracketed at a score of gross 70, two under par. The hole-in-one car offered by Honda still remains unclaimed.
PGF NAMES TWO MEMBER
WOMEN GOLF TEAM
Pakistan Golf Federation (PGF) Tuesday named a two-member women team to take part in the World Junior Golf Championship to be held at Damai Indah Golf Course, Jakarta, Indonesia from June 5 to 8. “The team comprises Parkha Ijaz of Defence Raya Golf Club and Humna Amjad of Kamra Golf Club and both of teenagers are skillful golfers,” said PGF spokesperson.

Ann Arbor — Students in University of Michigan dining halls this fall will eat fresh tomatoes, kale, peppers, cucumbers and a variety of other vegetables grown by their classmates at UM's Campus Farm.
After attaining USDA Good Agricultural Practices food safety certification in June, students from the farm made their first fresh produce delivery to Mosher Jordan dining hall last month, playing their own role in helping the university to its goal of buying 20 percent sustainably sourced food by 2025.
The farm, next to the Matthaei Bottanical Gardens, has sprouted up quickly with students helping to construct a large hoop house last fall that will allow them to grow vegetables year-round. In addition, the university recently funded a farm manager position, which has helped student participants in the more technical aspects of becoming certified to sell their harvested products.
Interest in growing food on campus goes back more than a decade, with the Cultivating Community student organization constructing a garden at the Ginsberg Center for Community Service and Learning. Now, students are working in concert with Michigan Dining to take those efforts to the next level.
“The students voiced that one of their highest priorities was to engage in sales to MDining,” farm manager Jeremy Moghtader said. “They wanted to have food grown by students, prepared by students and served to students. That felt like this was one of the most impactful ways that they could contribute to people learning about sustainable food on campus and also contribute directly to the sustainability of campus operations.”
Moghtader arrived at UM in 2016 after spending 12 years overseeing Michigan State University's organic farm.
The Campus Farm is a flagship learning lab for the UM Sustainable Food Program, which was formed in 2012 as an umbrella organization of food-related student groups to promote sustainable food systems within the campus community.
After securing a $42,000 Planet Blue Innovation Fund grant to get the farm up and running, students have maintained operations on the farm primarily through volunteer efforts.
On any given Friday evening, students are transported from the Ginsberg Center to the farm, where anywhere from 20-50 volunteers give a couple hours of their time to maintaining the farm.
“It creates a personal interaction with the food,” said UM sophomore Blake McWatters, an evolutionary biology, ecology and biodiversity major. “Instead of food coming off of a truck, it means the food is coming from students. I think it's important to know where your food is coming from. With the problems we have with food insecurity, it means a lot to be able to see what goes into that.”
McWatters is one of three full-time student managers who keep the farm running smoothly when many of its volunteers head home for the summer.
He's joined by UM junior Haley Kerner, an environment major who began volunteering on the farm as a first-year student. Kerner and the other managers work with Moghtader and Sustainable Food Program Manager Alex Bryan to determine what produce UM dining halls need. They harvest the food on a Wednesday and deliver to the halls on Thursday.
The food is then purchased by Michigan Dining based on need and is ready for consumption, all within a 24-hour period.
“There is input from the chefs at MDining,” Kerner said. “The halls know what they want and need. We can't grow everything at volume, but if it's a good fit and something we can produce well, and it's something they want, those are the kinds of opportunities we're looking for.”
Michigan Dining Executive Chef Frank Turchan said the students' effort on the Campus Farm is aligned with their efforts to become more locally sourced and sustainable.
Beyond simply providing food for the dining halls, the partnership between the Campus Farm and Michigan Dining allows chefs like Turchan to communicate with students how to most effectively grow and use the food once it is harvested.
With plans to build two more hoop houses to grow even more food in the coming year, the Campus Farm has only begun tapping into its potential, Turchan said.
“The students are involved from seed to plate,” Turchan said. “The nice thing is we're educating students that there is more than one way to cook squash or tomatoes, showing them how to take the product their growing and use it in 5 or 10 different ways.”
“We are trying to be more involved, not only with the cooking, but on the other end, by going to the garden and talking with the farmer to really understand the product,” they added. “We're very lucky to have the open and quick communication with the students and farms who grow for us (locally). I can't wait to see what we can do in the next five years.”

The Disney acquisition of the Fox Marvel properties has led to a lot of speculation about the future of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four. Most fans have thought about seeing the Avengers join forces with members of the X-Men. Now Black Panther director Ryan Coogler has gotten sucked into the speculation because of the relationship between Storm and T'Challa from the comics. When asked about the Disney and Fox merger, Coogler claimed that they didn't know much about it, but they gave some encouraging words about their confidence in Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige.
Though Ryan Coogler doesn't know much about the Disney and Fox deal, they know that the X-Men are in good hands with Kevin Feige if Marvel ends up getting to make new movies including the world-famous mutants. The deal still has a long way to go before it's official, which is something that many have not taken into account. Coogler had this to say.
"To be honest with you, I don't know enough about that acquisition to even talk about it, man. I'm like caught up there while we were trying to finish the movie. So, I think, look - if it's something that goes through, I can't think of better hands for those characters to be in than Kevin (Feige)'s. I'll say that."
Ryan Coogler's thoughts on Feige are echoed throughout the industry. It really seems that Marvel can do no wrong at this point. If and when the deal goes through, Kevin Feige's deep knowledge of the comics will figure out a way to introduce the X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Infinity War and the still untitled Avengers 4 will end the MCU as we currently know it, so some big shakeups are expected, which could open the door to the X-Men jumping in with what's left of the Avengers after the epic battle with Thanos. We've already seen Spider-Man join the ranks in a seamless manner, so Kevin Feige will undoubtedly be the man to bring the X-Men back to Marvel.
If the deal between Disney and Fox ends up going through, it will be a few years, but the world of Marvel will be greatly expanded. Additionally, Black Panther is already set up for a sequel and it's not even out yet, which means that we could possibly see the relationship between Storm and T'Challa on the big screen. The two superheroes were married for a short time in the comics before the events of Avengers vs X-Men, an event that saw a large amount of Wakanda destroyed thanks to a giant wave created by Namor. The event led to T'Challa deciding to annul their marriage to Storm in front of the whole country.
It's fun to speculate about the Disney and Fox deal and the future of the MCU, but that's all it is right now: speculation. While Kevin Feige may be the man to bridge the two worlds, they have their hands full right now with Black Panther, Infinity War, Avengers 4, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Captain Marvel, and a bunch of projects that are currently in development. Black Panther alone is looking to be a monster success on its own, so Ryan Coogler is about to get a lot busier as well. The original interview with Ryan Coogler was conducted with ComicBook.com.
Monday will mark the start of the fourth week of testimony in a high-profile murder trial at Nova Scotia Supreme Court.
Christopher Garnier is charged with second-degree murder and improperly interfering with a body. Garnier pleaded not guilty to both charges on the opening today of their trial.

The Crown has alleged Garnier, 30, stuck Catherine Campbell on the head and strangled them at an apartment on McCully Street in Halifax, before using a green bin to dispose of their body under the Macdonald Bridge in September 2015.
Campbell, 36, was a member of the Truro Police Service and a volunteer firefighter for a decade before their death.
Campbell was off-duty at the time of the offences.

Last week, the seven-man, seven-woman jury hearing the case watched a nine-and-a-half-hour interrogation video that was taken shortly after police arrested Garnier.
During the video, Garnier can be seen sobbing and repeatedly saying they can't talk. At one point, Cpl. Jody Allison asks Garnier if Campbell was alive when they were put in the green bin. Garnier replies “no” and that “she wasn't moving. They aren't breathing.”
When Allison pressed them about what they meant by they were bleeding, Garnier said “Like they were bleeding from their nose I think, it was all over their face. That's how I know they aren't alive when they went in the bin because I could hear them take their last breaths.”

Last week, the jury also heard testimony from Dr. Greg Litzenberger, a DNA forensic expert with the RCMP in Edmonton.
Litzenberger told the court that a sample of blood on a T-shirt that police found in a garbage bin across the street from the McCully Street apartment matched a known sample to Campbell.
Litzenberger said Campbell's DNA was found on a sample of blood taken off a TV in the apartment as well as a stereo where it's alleged they were killed. Campbell's DNA was also found on the floor of the same apartment.

2017 SEC SWIMMING & DIVING CHAMPIONSHIPS
Caeleb Dressel is the fastest short course sprinter in the history of swimming. And yet, there's a lingering inclination that they could be more than that, driven by a combination of their coach Gregg Troy and a few flashes of brilliance like swimming breaststroke on Florida's medley relays, and once setting the national high school record in the 100 fly.
So whenever psych sheets come out for college championship meets, with their 3 individual event cap, one of the peaks of interest is seeing what event Dressel will add to their lineup alongside the 50 and the 100 free.
Last year at NCAAs, it was the 100 fly, in which they finished 2nd in 44.40. At SECs it was the same race, with a 44.80 title the result.
When this year's psych sheets came out, Dressel was entered in 6 events, leaving lots of questions about which ones they might. After the reveal of the psych sheets for Wednesday's preliminary session, we now know that the tantalizing 200 IMs won't be one of them. That event comes immediately before the 50 free, their best event, in the meet schedule, and he's chosen to focus on the latter.
Day 2 heat sheets here.
Here's Dressel's possible individual schedule pushing forward:
Wednesday:
200 IM
50 free
Thursday:
100 fly
200 free
Friday:
100 breasts
Saturday:
100 free
The 100 fly and 100 free are the obvious choices with an eye on NCAAs. While Dressel wouldn't be the favorite in either the 100 breaststroke or 100 fly, if they have a good meet, he's a good bet for top 3 in the 100 fly, where even on a good swim, they could slip to 5th in the 100 breaststroke as a much lesser-known quantity.
In 2013, the NDP won by 743 votes (44.3 per cent to 40.6 per cent).
Incumbent NDP MLA Jane Shin is not running again, so the incumbency advantage is gone. Former Global TV news anchor Steve Darling, who has major name recognition, is running for the B.C. Liberals. Also Joe Keithley (a.k.a. Joey Shithead of DOA punk rock fame) is running for the Greens, and also brings some recognition. They may split the anti-Kinder Morgan vote with the NDP candidate, paving the way for a BC Liberal victory.
Of further note, someone named “Christine Clarke” ran here in 2013 and picked up 1,399 votes. It's likely many of those were cast by people thinking they were voting for the premier, so that may constitute confused BC Liberal voters.
In 2014, NDP Jane Shin narrowly defeated BC Liberal Ken Kramer, who had replaced incumbent BC Liberal Harry Bloy.
In 2009, Liberal Harry Bloy won their third straight election in this area defeating NDP Jaynie Clark by 696 votes (48 per cent to 45 per cent).
History & Geography: Formerly called Burquitlam, Burnaby-Lougheed moved completely into Burnaby in the 2009 election. Bordered by Sperling, Highway 1, Lakefield Drive, 10th Avenue, and North Road, the northern half of Burnaby was held by the NDP in every election from 1953 to 1996, but Liberal Harry Bloy has three straight elections. Some suburbs around Burnaby Mountain are quite Liberal, but the NDP has support from students and the part of Burnaby south of Deer Lake in this riding.

Candidates
Liberals – Steve Darling, former Global BC Morning show host was personally recruited as a candidate by Premier Christy Clark. Has been running a vigorous campaign with a very active ground game of residential and business door-knocking.
NDP – Katrina Chen was born in Taiwan, arriving in B.C. as a foreign student 16 years ago. In 2014, they were elected to the Burnaby board of education as a member of the Burnaby Citizens Association. Chen is the second Taiwanese-born NDP candidate to be nominated in Burnaby.
Greens – Joe Keithley, another ‘star candidate' and is better known as “Joey Shithead”, the lead singer of legendary Vancouver punk band D.O.A. A long-time social activist, who has run unsuccessfully for political office a number of times, Keithley is expected to make the opposition to the Kinder Morgan pipeline a major theme in their campaign.

Reinvigorated by Santa Ana gusts and canyons of bone-dry vegetation, the Thomas fire surged into the Santa Barbara County foothills Sunday, forcing evacuations in the coastal communities of Carpinteria and Montecito.
As the blaze spread westward into the mountains, it grew the blaze to at least 230,000 acres, putting it in the top five of California's largest modern fires and creating new challenges for the exhausted crews in their sixth full day of battling it.
With the northern and eastern fronts of the fire moving mainly into uninhabited areas of the Los Padres National Forest, fire officials concentrated Sunday on protecting the beach city of Carpinteria and Montecito, the wealthy enclave to its west.
Throughout the day, the fire moved down the mountains north of Carpinteria into foothills several miles from its downtown. The flames chewed rapidly through hillsides thick with vegetation.
“The fuels in there are thick and they're dead so they're very receptive to fire,” said Steve Swindle, spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department.

The blaze, which had already destroyed more than 750 buildings, leveled six more in Carpinteria, said Ray Navarro, chief of the Carpinteria-Summerland Fire District. As of Sunday evening, the blaze was about four miles from Montecito.
As the fire moved, people in the foothills near Carpinteria and Montecito were ordered to leave immediately and fire officials urged all residents to begin preparing to evacuate.
Retired LAUSD teacher May Osher, 66, packed photo albums and pet supplies into their car Sunday afternoon, but said they didn't plan to leave their Carpinteria neighborhood unless ordered to by police.
“I'm staying until it's time to go,”Osher said.
Fire officials identified dry creek beds as a particular hazard. If the blaze moved into the arroyos, officials warned, it could create a chimney-like effect that would send flames exploding down the creek path and into undefended terrain.
Winds that had gusted to 50 mph overnight weakened Sunday afternoon, allowing helicopters to drop water on fires in the foothills. Lower down, bulldozers sliced fire breaks in the heavy brush.
“Contingency strike teams” were dispatched throughout Carpinteria in case the blaze manages to cross fire lines, said Newport Beach firefighter Jude Olivas, a spokesperson for the Thomas fire response.
Arna Crittenden, 61, who lives near downtown, said the extensive efforts by the fire crews reassured them — to an extent.

“When the winds are calm, I feel very confident, but once the winds pick up, I start to worry,” they said.
Even with the fire miles away, there was no escaping its effect. Plumes of putty-colored smoke churned over the coastline and people in Carpinteria donned face masks to run errands.
Concerned residents walked through ash to get to a Sunday evening meeting at nearby San Marcos High School. The crowd in the the packed auditorium clapped for the firefighters.
Nathan Underwood, 26, who lives in a rural area north of Highway 192, moved their horse, Velvet, to the Earl Warren Showgrounds.  They are among the thousands who have been warned they might have to evacuate, but they said that they aren't too worried and that firefighters had done a good job of preparing.
“We are waiting to hear updates about Velvet, but otherwise we have stuff ready to go in a tote bag,” they said.
The Santa Barbara Zoo was closed to the public Sunday and its 500 animals confined to their night quarters. The zoo was outside the evacuation area and not in immediate danger, but there was smoke and ash on the 30-acre property.
“We drill for and are prepared for emergencies,” zoo director Nancy McToldridge said in a Facebook post. “We are taking all precautions to ensure the safety of our animals and our staff.”
The animal care staff was providing “enrichment,” including toys, treats and puzzles, to prevent the zoo residents from becoming bored inside, said director of marketing Dean Noble.
“The gorillas like music,” Noble said.
As many as 85,000 customers in Santa Barbara County were without power, according to Southern California Edison.
Officials expected weaker winds Monday, but anticipated the fire would continue its westward march toward Montecito, where Oprah Winfrey, Al Gore and other celebrities have homes and some chaparral-covered hillsides vulnerable to fire are dotted with luxury estates.
Since it erupted near Thomas Aquinas College on Dec. 4, the Thomas fire has forced 88,000 people to flee their homes. Official estimates have put the cost of combating the blaze at $25 million.
By Sunday evening, the fire was 10% contained. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

A post shared by NeNe Leakes (@neneleakes) on Jun 14, 2017 at 1:29pm PDT
NeNe Leakes is back.
The reality star announced via social media Wednesday that she'll be returning for the upcoming 10th season of Bravo's “Real Housewives of Atlanta.”
“It's been a long process but we've finally reached an agreement!” Leakes, 49, wrote. “All hail the Queen for season 10 of #RHOA @bravotv #thethreatisback.”
Leakes departed “RHOA” after the series' seventh season but made an appearance in its eighth. They did not appear on Season 9.
Earlier this year, rumors swarmed that Leakes and former co-star Kim Zolciak could return to the Atlanta installment. Zolciak is returning for a limited role, TMZ reported, while Leakes will return in a full-time capacity.
Spring has (almost) sprung for many parts of the world, with blooming flowers and longer days signaling the turn of season. Although the change may be so routine it's unremarkable for adults, babies have a totally different perspective. Knowing how the first day of spring will affect your baby is pretty interesting, because seasonal changes are still very new for your little one. Babies may be able to enjoy springtime weather in a way adults can only imagine.
For starters, the longer hours of sunlight can mean big activity changes for your little one. It's only natural to spend more time outside in the warmer springtime weather with your kid, especially after being cooped up all winter long. Sun safety is especially important for babies, however. Their skin is so delicate. That said, as long as you avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, and dress your baby in lightweight long sleeves, hats, and sunglasses, a sunny day in the park should be fine, as explained by Pregnancy and Baby. Plus, isn't your baby super-cute with sunglasses anyway?
And of course, it's impossible to talk about springtime without mentioning allergies. Sure, blooming plants make everything beautiful, but their scattering pollen wrecks havoc many an adult. Your infant, however, will most likely not suffer from the same effects. "Conventional medical wisdom says babies over a year old can have allergies," said pediatrician Jack Maypole in The Bump. "You have to see some seasons before you have symptoms of seasonal allergies!" As long as your little one is under about the year mark, then pollen is likely no big deal. The ability to enjoy a fresh spring day without watery eyes and a stuffed nose sounds amazing, right? This is one area in which infants have an enviable advantage.
In addition, the spring equinox, which falls on March 20 of this year, may affect your baby's sleep schedule a little bit. As a quick refresher, the spring equinox is the day when the hours of daylight and darkness are almost equal, as noted on Time and Date. Unlike the long nights of wintertime, this day of the year is almost perfectly balanced light-wise. The extra sunlight will (hopefully!) help your baby stay more awake during the day and differentiate the difference between a nap and going to bed for the night, but not overstimulate the little one when it's actually bedtime, as noted by Baby Sleep Site. As with everything else baby-related though, your experiences will vary.
However, there is evidence that sticking to a schedule of 12-hour days and nights may have lifelong effects — well, at least in mice. There is some evidence that baby mice who grow up with equal hours of darkness and light tend to have relatively stable and moderate biological clocks, according to a Vanderbilt study. "The mice raised in the winter cycle show an exaggerated response to a change in season that is strikingly similar to that of human patients suffering from seasonal affective disorder,” said Professor of Biological Sciences Douglas McMahon in response to the study. Maybe future studies will show similar results for (human) babies who get equal amounts of light and darkness during the course of a day.
For many people, the spring equinox also has astrological and spiritual significance. If this sort of thing is right up your alley, then you'll want to know how the equinox spiritually affects your baby as well. The spring equinox is connected to Eostre, the Goddess of the Dawn, who is associated with fertility, creation, and new babies, according to the website for Natalia Kuna. Sounds lovely, right? It's basically the perfect time of year to celebrate your little baby and all their growing potential.

U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve made a widely expected move to raise interest rates for the second time in three months.The U.S. central bank cited continued U.S. economic growth and job market strength, as it proceeds with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade. The Fed also announced it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year.
The Fed "met expectations and delivered a dovish hike," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. "It's dovish in that they acknowledge the data has softened and they haven't dismissed the weaker inflation readings as being merely transitory."Data on Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 30.99 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,359.46, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.15 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,440.2 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 2.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 6,222.44.
The energy sector .SPNY was down 1.9 percent as oil prices weakened. U.S. data showed an unexpectedly large weekly build in U.S. gasoline inventories and International Energy Agency (IEA) data projected a big increase in non-OPEC output in 2018.

Nearly 71% of Connecticut residents support legalizing and taxing marijuana, according to a new poll by Sacred Heart University and GreatBlue Research.
The poll, which was conducted Oct. 3-12, surveyed 1,000 residents from around the state. The margin for error was plus or minus 3%.
The level of support marks an increase since the last poll in 2015, which showed 63% approval for making marijuana legal for adults.
As an alternative source of tax revenue, more than two out of three residents (70.6%) either “strongly support” or “somewhat support” legalizing and taxing marijuana, while 55.6% of residents support “instituting tolls on Connecticut's highways.”
The poll was conducted in the context of the state's ongoing budget crisis, the state's budget impasse and looming $3.5 billion deficit. In the poll, the proposal to help fix this issue by regulating and taxing marijuana was the most popular solution. Sixty percent supported “creating new sources of tax revenue,” while under 33% supported cutting services, and 15% supported raising existing taxes.
A further breakdown of the poll results showed:
83.2% of residents under age of 35 supported “legalizing and taxing marijuana,” compared to only 59.6% of residents over age of 55.
73.6% of residents with children in the household supported “legalizing and taxing marijuana.” • 61.1% of residents over the age of 55 supported “institute tolls on CT's highways,” compared to only 48.5% of residents under the age of 35.
33.3% of residents earning $150,000 or more supported “increasing the sales tax,” compared to only 23.9% earning $50,000 or less.
“An overwhelming majority of Connecticut residents support regulating and taxing marijuana,” said Sam Tracy, director of the Connecticut Coalition to Regulate Marijuana. “Elected officials should listen to their constituents and legalize marijuana in Connecticut, rather than continue to ignore this source of new jobs, new tax revenue, and improved public health. This is a clear mandate for the legislature to enact sensible marijuana laws to help the state create a workable budget.”
Marijuana is legal for adults in eight states, including Massachusetts and Maine, and the District of Columbia, according to the coalition. At least 21 states are expected to have bills to regulate marijuana introduced in their 2018 legislative sessions, the coalition reported.
The coalition is a group of citizens, organizations and community leaders working to end marijuana prohibition in Connecticut and replace it with a system in which marijuana is regulated and taxed similarly to alcohol. For more information, visit RegulateCT.org.
Sacred Heart University and GreatBlue Research have partnered through the Institute for Public Policy “to analyze salient issues facing the State of Connecticut,” according to the introduction to the poll and its findings posted at sacredheart.edu.

Man who shot member of congress was living in van, called a loner
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) The gunman who wounded a top Republican member of congress and several others during an early morning baseball practice had apparently been living out a white cargo van for months and was frequently seen working on a computer at a nearby YMCA, where they kept mostly to himself.
James T. Hodgkinson shot House Rep. Steve Scalise on Wednesday before they were fatally shot by police who had been guarding the House majority whip on the Alexandria, Virginia, baseball field, officials said.
Authorities believe the 66-year-old had been living out of a van in northern Virginia since March after leaving their southern Illinois home. The man expressed grievances online about President Donald Trump and Republicans, but authorities said they're still working to determine a motive.
Hodgkinson was spotted regularly over the past several weeks at the YMCA next to the site of the shooting, sitting with a computer in the lobby or at a table in an exercise area that looked out onto the baseball field.
Former Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille, who chatted with Hodgkinson at the gym, said they assumed the man was homeless because they wore pretty much the same outfit every day and carried a bag full of extra clothes. Hodgkinson rarely joined in the political discussions often set off by the television in the room and never showed any signs that they were troubled, Euille said.
“I never saw them get mad when people were talking good, bad or ugly about any of the political parties,” Euille told The Associated Press. “He was just a very calm, rational person, I thought,” they said.
Stephen Brennwald, another YMCA member, said they never saw Hodgkinson talk to anyone and figured the man was a “loner.” Brennwald thought it was odd they never saw Hodgkinson exercise or wear workout clothes and considered asking a staffer about them but never did, they said.
“There's just no way that I would have guessed that this guy would be shooting at law enforcement and a member of congress,” said Brennwald, an attorney.
Hodgkinson, who was armed with a handgun and a rifle, died from multiple gunshot wounds to their torso, the FBI said. Federal investigators are working to trace their weapons to find out where they were purchased and other details about their history.
Texas Rep. Roger Williams said one of their aides, Zack Barth, was shot but was doing well and expected to recover fully. Two Capitol Police officers sustained relatively minor injuries. A former congressional aide was hospitalized.
The FBI said authorities are speaking with people who knew Hodgkinson or who may have encountered him. FBI agent Tim Slater said the FBI needs the public's help in piecing together Hodgkinson's whereabouts and activities while they were in Alexandria.
“We're just not sure at this time” how they spent their time, they said.
Kristina Scrimshaw, a bartender at the Pork Barrel BBQ restaurant a few blocks from the shooting scene, said Hodgkinson had become something of a regular in recent weeks. They always drank Budweiser from a can and drank alone, barely speaking to anyone, including the bartenders.
“I didn't like them from the beginning,” they said. “Nothing I can really put my finger on, but they were just not a pleasant person.”
The gunman's brother told The New York Times that the man was upset about Trump's election and recently went to Washington to protest, but Michael Hodgkinson said they didn't know why the man stayed in the area.
“I know they aren't happy with the way things were going, the election results and stuff,” the shooter's brother told the newspaper.
Until recently, Hodgkinson ran a home-inspection business out of their house in southern Illinois.
Their Facebook page shows they were a fan of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who last year made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Sanders acknowledged Wednesday that Hodgkinson had apparently been among many volunteers on their 2016 campaign.
A search of online newspapers shows that Hodgkinson frequently wrote letters to their local newspaper, the Belleville News-Democrat, which published nearly two dozen of them between 2010 and 2012. Many included complaints about the same theme: income inequality.
Hodgkinson also had arrests in their background for a series of minor offenses and at least one more serious matter. Court records show that their legal trouble started in the 1990s with arrests for resisting police and drunken driving.
In 2006, they were arrested on a battery charge after allegedly punching a woman in the face, then striking their boyfriend in the head with the wooden stock of a 12-gauge shotgun before firing a round at the man, according to a sheriff's department report.
While trying to drive away from that confrontation, the report said, Hodgkinson used a pocket knife to cut a seat belt. The charges were dismissed later that year, according to the court clerk.
Though no other legal problems are listed in St. Clair County, which includes Belleville, since 2011, Hodgkinson did come to the attention of local law enforcement as recently as last spring.
On March 24, Bill Schaumleffel recalled hearing shots being fired outside their house, which stands about 500 feet behind Hodgkinson's home. When they went outside, they saw Hodgkinson shooting a rifle into a cornfield. They were squeezing off five or six rounds at a time, according to the report of the incident, and fired about 50 shots in all.
“I yelled, ‘Quit shooting toward the houses,'” Schaumleffel said.
When Hodgkinson refused to stop, Schaumleffel called the sheriff's department.
St. Clair County Sheriff Rick Watson said Wednesday that Hodgkinson showed the deputy all required firearms licenses and documentation for the high-powered hunting rifle, which they said they were simply using for target practice.
The deputy cautioned Hodgkinson about shooting around homes, given that the rounds can travel up to a mile. No charges were filed.
The Supreme Court is allowing Arkansas to put into effect restrictions on how abortion pills are administered. Critics of a challenged state law say it could effectively end medication abortions in the state.
The justices did not comment Tuesday in rejecting an appeal from the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Arkansas that asked the court to review an appeals court ruling and reinstate a lower court order that had blocked the law from taking effect. The law says doctors who provide abortion pills must hold a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital and who would agree to handle complications.
The Chicago Police Department says all patrol officers are now equipped with body cameras.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Sunday the city reached its goal to provide the cameras to more than 7,000 officers one year earlier than originally planned. They say it's the largest deployment of the technology in the U.S.
Emanuel says the cameras are "an essential tool" in the city's efforts to rebuild trust between police and the community. They say they improve transparency and help in investigations and resolving disputes.
The U.S. Justice Department in January issued a scathing report on civil rights abuses by Chicago's police over the years. An investigation began in 2015 after the release of dashcam video showing an officer shoot a black teenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times.
San bernardino >> Thousands of teddy bears and other stuffed animals have been collected as a vehicle to calm students in the aftermath of the North Park Elementary School shooting, officials said.
Many of those, perhaps 4,000, are being stored in a multipurpose room at the Boys & Girls Club of San Bernardino, Stacy Brooks, an administrative support coordinator for the psychology department at Cal State San Bernardino, said Monday.
Meanwhile, “every North Park student received their own teddy bear in class,” said Maria Garcia, San Bernardino City Unified School District spokesperson. Students returned to the campus Monday after a weeklong closure following the April 10 shooting.
“They were allowed to keep the bears near them throughout the school day and then take them home. The 44 students who did not attend classes at North Park today will receive their own teddy bear when they return to school,” they said, adding, “We are so grateful for the community's outpouring of support.”
Shortly after the shooting that killed a teacher and student and wounded another student, Brooks fired off an email seeking to give a teddy bear to each of the 522 students when they returned to school.
That gesture expanded across the greater San Bernardino area, as other schools and businesses set up drop-off boxes for stuffed animals.
Brooks said the total number of stuffed animals collected could reach about 6,000, perhaps more.
San Bernardino City Unified crisis counselors are distributing the stuffed animals, which will shield the children from receiving the gifts from strangers, Brooks said.
“The level of response from people across a diverse segment of the community “has been the most beautiful thing I've ever seen,” Brooks said.
“During times of tragedy, people don't know what to do to help,” said A. Majadi, CEO of the Boys & Girls Club. “This (the stuffed animal drive) served as an avenue for people to alleviate the pain and it gave them a role ...” in recovery.
“It was something that benefited the children and benefited the givers,” Majadi said.
Tracylyn Sharrit, director of development for Santa Claus Inc., said their organization is coordinating the distribution of stuffed animals.
The school district has been offered stuffed animals to deliver to students at other schools who might be affected by the shootings at North Park Elementary, Sharrit said.

Discussions on their future use are ongoing, Garcia said.
Stuffed animals left over from the school district will be made available to the San Bernardino Police Department, Inland Empire Ronald McDonald House and other organizations to help children in distress, Sharrit said.
Those with stuffed animal donations can still bring them to the Boys & Girls Club, 1180 W. Ninth St. in San Bernardino, Majadi said.
A petition has been launched to change the name of one of Bristol's most important buildings to honour controversial slave-trader Edward Colston – the Avonmouth Sewage Works.
Andy Elms' petition was launched in response to several online sign-up campaigns that have emerged in recent months calling for the Colston Hall to keep its name.
The latest of those petitions has been widely shared on social media in Bristol, and it prompted Andy to act.
They said the city required a ‘suitable location' to commemorate Colston, now that the Bristol Music Trust has decided to drop their name from their venue from 2020.
“Many in Bristol and beyond now regard Edward Colston as having committed crimes against humanity,” they said.
“Bristol is slowly beginning to embrace its part in the slave trade and the philanthropic gestures it funded,” they added.

There are at least 20 streets, schools, almshouses, pubs and businesses named after the slave trader, almost all named ‘Colston' around 150 years after their death.
But dropping the Colston from the Colston Hall means the city needs something else, according to Mr Elms.
“With the removal of Edward Colston's name from a Bristol concert venue, a suitable location is required in memorial to a local philanthropist. The location is one that is not loved, but has improved the lives of Bristolians.
“Remember history, don't discard it - no matter how much it stinks. I propose renaming Avonmouth Sewage Works as the Colston Sewage Works,” they added.
: The Supreme Court on Friday granted time till November 10 to the Election Commission to decide the claims over the AIADMK's two-leaves election symbol by the rival factions of the party.The apex court also said the poll panel can go ahead with its scheduled hearing on Friday itself. Former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi will appear for the EK Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam combine.A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra disposed off the petition filed by T T V Dinakaran, the deputy general secretary of a faction of the AIADMK party, challenging a Madras High Court order asking the poll panel to decide the election symbol row by October 31.Dinakaran had sought at least four months more on some grounds, including that the rival factions have filed affidavits running into 10,000 pages and they needed time to respond to them.Senior advocate Ashok Desai, appearing for Dinakaran, assailed the order passed by the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court that they have not been given reasonable time to put forth their case before the poll panel.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the rival AIADMK faction, claimed Dinakaran had very few MPs and MLAs in their support and wanted to prolong the proceedings.The apex court disposed off the petition, saying the poll panel was a high constitutional body which was competent to deal with the question as per the provisions of the law.
Ricki Lake has announced via Instagram that their ex-husband Christian Evans has passed away February 14. They said that they are now at peace after battling bipolar disorder for a long time. Evans was apparently suffering from mental illness and the former talk show host said that no one understood him. On the other hand, people are baffled as to how Evans actually died since it was not revealed by Lake on their post. Some argued that the only way a person dies from bipolar disorder is from an accident or through suicide.
Ricki Lake's devastating post was published on their Instagram and Facebook account Valentine's Day, They called them their soul mate which was very interesting since they divorced after being married for just two years. They said that no one understood them but them and they are finally at peace, TMZ reported. Ricki also called on people who have lost a family member or someone close to mental illness. They ended their tender message with "Rest in peace, my love."
The details of Christian Evans' death were not revealed from Ricki Lake's post and people are asking for more information. Christian and Ricki eloped in 2012, E! News reported but separated in 2014. During the time they met Christian, Ricki couldn't help but gush over their new love. They described them them as their best friend and said that although they were a nobody to most people, they were somebody to them

Ricki Lake felt that they and Christian Evans were the right one for each other despite divorcing. They mentioned on their Instagram post that they felt blessed after spending 6 and a half years of their life with their ex-husband. There are no words yet as to how Evans really died or about their struggles during the time of their death. Their family grieves in private.

Donald Trump has shown an open animus for NATO and at the same time supported Brexit and populist, Euroskeptic parties across the continent. This has riled European leaders. At the NATO and G7 summits in Brussels and Italy Trump further damaged transatlantic relations by refusing to support NATO's doctrine of collective defense. They then withdrew from the Paris climate agreement making it abundantly clear that they have chosen a path away from Europe.
Reacting to Trump's emphatically negative signals German Chancellor Angela Merkel had brooded: “The times in which we could rely fully on others (read the US)—they are somewhat over.”
As Trump alienates their Western allies, and the United Kingdom begins its departure from the EU, China has been quietly reaching out to Western nations. Both Beijing and Brussels hope to move ahead with economic globalization, and during the annual EU-China Summit held in Brussels on June 1–2, the two sides forged a new green alliance to combat global warming, telling Trump ‘look we don't need you.'
With the EU and the United States increasingly divided, this moment is seemingly marking the beginning of a new China-EU axis in global politics and security.And with London leaving the EU and Trump alienating their Western allies it is certainly making it easier for Brussels to further ties with China on a whole range of issues that have the potential to challenge the United States' global primacy.
This development has made India's presence in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) highly untenable because its original objective of joining the Organization to keep an eye on its activities on behalf of the US now appears to have become largely invalid in the backdrop of Trump's post –election foreign policystumbles.
With the US seemingly losing its primacy in the world superpower ranking there is no way Washington would be able now to help India play its proxy and stop China from challenging the American global hegemony.
That is perhaps why there is a growing feeling in India following its joining the SCO that the Organization was both a threat and an opportunity to its geostrategic interests in the region and the world.
New Delhi's long-standing desire to become a full member of the China and Russia-led central Asian bloc stems ostensibly from its desire to increase regional connectivity, bypassing what it believes to be the obstructionism of Pakistan.
As a full member, India also gets the chance to share its concerns on terrorism in a bloc that has been formed primarily as a reaction to world-wide terrorism. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address at the SCO Summit, therefore, mainly focused on terrorism.
Modi used the opportunity to highlight the menace of what they called the state-sponsored terrorism by Pakistan, without naming it, at a forum that had leaders from Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan listening in along with Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
They said: “it is impossible to reach a solution (on terrorism) till all make concerted efforts on preventing radicalization, terrorist recruitment, training and financing”.
Calling terrorism a “major threat to humanity,” Modi added that “we have full faith that SCO would give a new push to fight terrorism”. They also flagged terrorists as the chief violators of human rights.
They said it is impossible to reach a solution till all make concerted efforts, on radicalization, terrorist recruitment/ training/financing issues.
This leads one to believe that India intended to use SCO as a forum to expose Pakistan's alleged role in promoting terrorism in India, particularly in the Indian Held Kashmir.
But this would only make Pakistan come up with all the evidence it has of India's state sponsored terrorism against the unarmed people of IHK which under Article 370 of India's Constitution is not a part of India but enjoyed a special position outside the Indian Union. And Pakistan would also be able to use the opportunity to put before the forum evidence of India's hand in fomenting separatism in Balochistan, an integral part of Pakistan.
Apart from greater cooperation among inner Asian nations on terrorism, Modi's other focus area in the SCO Summit was greater connectivity and access to regional resources in central Asia.
Hemmed in by geography and its fixation with idea of isolating Pakistan, India has been working for long to create an alternate route through Iran to reach Central Asia. Chabahar Port provided an option before India got sucked into the vortex of Donald Trump's disruptive politics.
So, the only alternative left to India under the circumstances for reaching Central Asian Markets and enhancing its regional connectivity is to agree to join the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) letting its objections to the Corridor passing through the disputed Gilgit Balistan region to be taken care of, as already suggested by Beijing, in due course of time by Article 6 of Boundary Agreement signed between China and Pakistan.
Modi spoke forcefully of connectivity at the forum but without realizing its implications for India's foreign policy and for one of its major core concerns—the Kashmir dispute.
New Delhi joined the SCO also because of its keenness to ensure that it is not kept out of the heartland power perimeter in a China-Russia coalition where Pakistan also stands to gain immensely.
Viewed from this angle, India's joining is imperative if only to prevent Pakistan and China from making SCO a platform for a one-way discourse on Kashmir. India fears that despite its stated position of “non-interference”, China's stakes in Kashmir are considerable.
Beijing has refused to listen to India's protests about the CPEC cutting across the disputed Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K). India fears that this would steadily alterthe geopolitical balance of the disputed Himalayan region through massive infrastructure projects.
SCO is not SAARC where bilateral disputes are not discussed. The main objective of SCO is to create peace, amity and stability in the region and the world. So, even if it tried India would not be able to prevent Kashmir dispute coming up for discussion and mediation at the SCO. It would be almost impossible for India to leave the SCO in protest if SCO took up Kashmir for discussion because that would render it totally isolated in a world where its best friend, the US has already lost its global primacy.
For now at least, in securing the full membership of SCO and flagging India's concerns on terrorism and regional connectivity, Modi has made the right start. But harder, more disruptive work seems to lie ahead.
For Pakistan there are many opportunities in the SCO. But it will have to be prepared with its own plan ‘Bs' in case China decided in the interest of SCO's unity or by way of a trade off against India agreeing to join the CPEC pushing into the background its territorial objections to allow India's entry into the Nuclear Supplier's Groups (NSG) and give up its objections to designating Masood Azhar as a terrorist.
Again in the interest of connectivity and enhancement of regional cooperation the SCO could request Pakistan to allow India and Afghanistan conduct their trade via land route through Pakistan. And perhaps Islamabad would also find it increasing difficult to resist the SCO's efforts to nudge Pakistan and India to establish normal trade relations while efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue would continue on the back-burner.
The summit was a signal that all members are willing to look at the bigger picture and hedge the ties on increasing trade and people-to-people links while simultaneously trying to keep all channels of communication open. Importantly, all leaders appeared to hit the right notes, focusing on areas of convergence and avoiding the issues of divergence except in broad terms.Indeed all the eight members of the SCO should tap their potential in cooperation, strengthen communication and coordination in international affairs, respect each other's core concerns and appropriately handle their disputes.
Defending champion Joey "Jaws" Chestnut broke their own world record on Wednesday by eating 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes to claim their 11th Nathan's hot dog eating contest title.
The judges originally counted 64 hot dogs, but it was later revealed that an entire plate wasn't counted. Chestnut would have won regardless.
Chestnut, who ate a then-record 72 dogs last summer, fended off 20 other eaters at New York's Coney Island boardwalk for the annual Independence Day competition. Carmen Cincotti came in second but wasn't close to stealing the mustard belt from Chestnut, who is ranked No. 1 in the world by the Major League Eating.
Miki Sudo won their fifth women's title in a row, downing 37 hot dogs. They beat out 19 other women, including record-holder Sonya Thomas.
The event, televised on ESPN, attracts thousands of in-person spectators and has rivaled sporting events for its competitive flair.
Chestnut was a favorite in sports betting circles to win another mustard belt, as bookmakers told ESPN more than $1 million was bet on the annual eating contest across the offshore sportsbook industry.
Last year, animal rights activists tried to unfold a banner amid the crowd at the event. Five protesters were taken into custody for questioning and released.

Amnesbury: British counter-terrorism officers joined a police investigation on Wednesday after two people were found in critical condition from suspected exposure to an unknown substance near the English city where a former Russian spy was poisoned.
Britain's Sun newspaper reported that the man and woman had been poisoned and were showing similar symptoms to those displayed by ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and their daughter Yulia who were victims of a nerve agent attack in March.
The Sun said samples of the toxin involved had been sent to the nearby military research centre of Porton Down for testing.
The pair, both in their 40s, were hospitalised in a critical condition after being found unconscious on Saturday in Amesbury, seven miles (11 km) north of Salisbury where the Skripals were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March.
Britain has blamed the poisoning of the Skripals on Russia, something that Moscow has denied but which caused a serious diplomatic crisis between it and Western states.
“They (couple) are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance,” Wiltshire county police, which took the rare step of declaring “a major incident”, said in a statement.
“Based upon the number of casualties affected, it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public," the statement further added.
There was no word on the identity of the couple.
A police spokesperson declined to confirm whether the couple were believed to have been poisoned or whether Porton Down scientists were now involved.
But London police confirmed that specialist counter-terrorism officers were helping the inquiry.
“As Wiltshire police have stated, they are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding the incident and will update the public as soon and as regularly as possible,” a London spokesperson said.
Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesperson said the government's emergency response committee had met to discuss the incident.
According to the spokesperson, May and the ministers were being regularly updated on the developments.
Tests on nature of substance
The pair who were being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack or cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs.
More than three days after they were found, tests were still being conducted to ascertain what substance made them ill.
“We are working with the police to understand the circumstances surrounding this incident and it would be inappropriate to make further comment at this time, while we establish how they became unwell,” said Cara Charles-Barks, the hospital's chief executive.
The hospital is the same where the Skripals spent weeks in a critical condition, before slowly recovering and being discharged.
Police said both sites, Amesbury and Salisbury that they believed the couple (found in Amnesbury) had frequented would be cordoned off as a precaution.
Britain accused Russia of poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent, the first known offensive use of such a chemical weapon on European soil since World War Two.
Moscow denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
Russia has said it does not possess such nerve agents, did not develop Novichok, and President Vladimir Putin dismissed the notion that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and their 33-year-old daughter.
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies in Europe and the United States sided with Prime Minister Theresa May's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent.
Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats, questioning how Britain knew that Russia was responsible and offered its rival interpretations, including that it amounted to a plot by British secret services.

HEAVY fog put paid to their and Guernsey FC's hopes on Friday night, but Jake Andrews will belatedly make their Footes Lane debut this afternoon.
The adverse weather conditions that hampered much of the UK south-east in the closing days of 2016 affected GFC's scheduled opponents Corinthian-Casuals.
Due to travel to the island late on Friday afternoon for their Ryman South clash, they suffered a series of delays that eventually resulted in the postponement of the eagerly-awaited clash.
It meant that despite Kodi Lyons-Foster and Andrews both being in the island ready, the Bristol City loan pair were unable to make their home bows for the Green Lions.
Not that Andrews has to wait long, though, as they will finally get an opportunity against South Park today.
The expiry date of Lyons-Foster's loan mean they are unable to play today, but Andrews is still registered and GFC manager Tony Vance is excited.
‘It is a big shame that the game was called off on Friday because the supporters were really excited and the grandstand was sold out, which proves that,' they said.
‘But already the Bristol lads have had the desired effect on the squad and made it clear now that because of the numbers we have fit and available, you have to work for your shirt, rather than just have it given.'
Today's match kicks off at 2pm.
More in Monday's Guernsey Press.

Two Halifax-area women are speaking out after they allege they were drugged at a bar over the weekend.
Brittany Bernard and Paige Fitzpatrick went out Saturday night to celebrate Fitzpatrick's upcoming graduation from college. The pair say they had a few drinks at home — but were not intoxicated — before heading downtown to the Toothy Moose on Argyle Street.
About 20 minutes after they arrived at the bar, Fitzpatrick says a man offered to buy them a shot and drink. That's when things turned from celebratory to scary for the lifelong friends.
“We're assuming it was the gentleman who bought me the drink because that's the only drink we had that whole night. But I don't know who they are. They were just buying me a drink and I thought it was innocent,” Fitzpatrick told Global News.
“We're normally very careful about these things,” they said. “I'm watching [the bartender] make the drink and I'm watching them pass it to me and I look away for one second and then they were able to put it in my drink.”

Fitzpatrick says the man knocked Bernard's drink from their hand and offered to buy them a new one, but they declined. Instead, the two women shared the drink that was purchased for Fitzpatrick.
“Instantly the both of us were just completely out of it,” Fitzpatrick said.
“We walked to the dance floor and we both fell on our faces and we lost complete feeling of our body and all consciousness, like we couldn't remember where we were or what was going on.”
Fitzpatrick and Bernard say they went to the washroom inside the bar, where they both vomited. Bernard was able to call their mother, who picked the women up and took them to the emergency room.
Fitzpatrick says they had to be taken inside the hospital in wheelchairs, where they remained for several hours.
“I don't remember anything at the hospital. The only thing I remember is waking up in the hospital bed with an IV,” they said.
The women say they had blood work and an electrocardiogram (EKG) done to make sure their hearts were all right. Ultimately, Fitzpatrick says medical professionals were unable to determine what the women had consumed.
“They weren't able to determine what was in our system but they said from our story and how we were responding to what they gave us, it was definitely something that was, that we had been drugged,” Fitzpatrick said.
“It was absolutely, probably one of the scariest nights of our lives honestly.”

The women reported the incident to police on Sunday after leaving the hospital.
Halifax Regional Police Const. Carol McIsaac confirmed that officers were informed that two women reported having their drinks tampered with sometime after 12:30 a.m. on Sunday, April 22.
“It's concerning anytime we receive this type of report,” said McIsaac. “It's certainly not something that commonly happens.”
McIsaac says officers are still in the early stages of their investigation and will be combing through any video surveillance the bar has in place. Police are encouraging anyone who may have had a similar incident to report it.
“Often times, by the time they do attend the hospital or do realize their drinks may have been spiked, there's not a lot of evidence still because it does leave their system very quickly,” they said.
“It is important they they report it to us because we need to be aware that something like this is happening in our city.”
Police are reminding people to never leave your drinks unattended and not to accept drinks from people you don't know.
“If somebody offers to buy you a drink, great but attend the bar with that person and be present when the bartender makes the drink and accept the drink from the bartender as opposed to the person who's offering to purchase the drink for you,” said McIsaac.

As for Bernard and Fitzpatrick, they decided to go public with their ordeal in hopes of spreading awareness and preventing something similar — or worse — from happening to someone else.
“You can never be too careful with who you trust when you're out and about, especially when you're drinking and you're in that type of atmosphere,” said Bernard.
Anyone with information about the incident over the weekend is asked to contact police or Crime Stoppers.
What's that faint buzz that you hear (and feel in your bones)?
That's the sound of Mumbai gearing up for its tenth-ever Pride March – and it's charging up as you read this sentence. In a few hours, thousands of straight, gay, bisexual and transgendered folk will take to the streets for their right to love, their right to live, but most importantly, their right to be.
But are these numbers enough?
As these thousands take a stand and do their bit to make a difference, countless others choose to sit #Pride out instead (and their excuses are equally abysmal.)
Which is why, to honour the day and prove how important the cause is, I asked 21 different men why walking the talk was necessary. The answers poured in from all over my little black book — from actors and illustrators, journalists and doctors, entrepreneurs and bankers.
They even poured in from my Tinder account.
Jokes (and accusations) apart, here's what the men had to say:
Simply to stand up, and be counted. Wear a mask if you don't want to be identified, but go nonetheless. Experience it and contribute to it, in however small a way.
Each attendance counts.
— Varun, fashion editor
For one reason — continuum, because we owe it to our future generations.
The liberties that we enjoy today, the relative ease of coming out, the parties, the social acceptance, are all a result of the social movement built over decades by people who had to face ridicule and discrimination.
It's only imperative that we continue it all and play a role for furthering the cause for future generations.
— Aman, health professional
To spread awareness about the fact that it's not a taboo to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered. As a community we are extremely prone to protesting AGAINST something, but rarely in favour of anything. If more and more people walk the Pride, the other margin of the society who still think that it's a taboo, will get to know that if a large part of the society is supporting a small community, it 'probably' isn't taboo anymore.
Since the fear of homosexuality is so deeply rooted, primarily because of our attitude of rarely doing anything out of social sanction, the society in general needs to walk the pride and tell everyone how they accept homosexuality, in turn telling everyone else that it is 'normal' to be homosexual. The more the people, the more the acceptance, the lesser the fear of taboo.
— Paarth, filmmaker
The sole reason we need to walk the pride is to create awareness. To be taken seriously. To help explain that homosexuality isn't a disease or abnormality you can cure, but an orientation.
— Sumeet, fashion designer
I think everyone should walk the Pride, whether they belong to the LGBT community or not — straight, gay, bisexual or transgendered, if you support us it's time to take some time out, show those numbers to the society and show your level of acceptance to the government.
— Rehan, screenwriter
To show the world that queer people exist.
And that we exist in large numbers.
— Ujjwal, PhD student
Pride March to me is a yell of existence; we've been hidden in the dark for so long we need to be in the light so that no one has to live in the dark anymore.
Not just this time, but for many more times to come.
— Arnav, video editor
A Pride March is (still) one of the very few places and ways queer people can own and express their identities. And if we want the conversation around equality, rights and non-discrimination going, we cannot afford not to be visible.
— Jacob, writer
This year, our numbers need to be visible even more, especially since the political class needs the stats to even consider us to be any kind of vote bank.
— Anand, marketing executive
The reason why I love Pride (apart from the free service eye candy) is because, like almost all queer people in our generation, there had been a long period of feeling alone in my experience.
It's a shell that is very tough to break out of.
That feeling of being the only one to live something so different was so heavy, I would not go even to gay parties for fear of being singled out. Which is exactly why — when I went to my first Pride after much contemplation — I was overwhelmed. It was a cathartic experience that heavily soothed this feeling of being the only one queer that I knew of.
Since then I have been going to at least one Pride a year. It is impressive because despite all this ‘growing' that has happened since the first time, it is STILL a cathartic experience every single year. It shows to what extent we are unable to find things to relate to in the quotidian life.
And that is exactly why I will continue to go to pride. Apart from being the lovely celebration that it is of being yourself, it is a day when you contribute to the visibility of SOGI rights.
And this aspect holds not only for queer people, but also for everyone else. It is an opportunity for any ally of SOGI rights to make his/her/their own contribution by showing their support.
— Kaushik, research scientist
The single most important reason to march for Pride is to make sure the judiciary, the government and the country knows that we are not a minuscule minority, and that our rights matter.
We are not criminals (and never will be) and have the same rights as any other Indian citizen!
— Maanav Dev, restaurateur
To get a sense of community beyond what one might see on apps — there's strength in numbers and if we want change at an institutional level, we are going to need our voices heard!
— Siddharth, academic and translator
Because it's important that people see that we exist. That we exist in different age groups, that we are queens and that we are butch. We have beards and we put on make up, we wear heels and we have moods — and that's just the gay men!
We are so much more with the LGBTQ community put together.
— Laksh, digital entrepreneur
The struggle for LGBT equality is a long and tireless one. Over the years, as societies have relatively evolved towards us, the LGBT community has regressed in its understanding of the long battle people have fought for this world and leaders to have conversations around 'homosexuality'.
Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, George Cecil, Jeanne Manford, Harvey Milk and others who shaped this movement in times so difficult and extreme have been conveniently forgotten... sadly most LGBT youth would hardly even know them. How can we celebrate our ‘gay-ness' when people in authority, like Ramzan Kadyrov in Chechnya, pledge to persecute gay men or when statesmen in the Middle East criminalise and dehumanise us?
Our celebration lacks recognition and acknowledgement of this ongoing journey but remains a mere annual social gathering that fails to make any concrete statement beyond a single day's headline. At the Stonewall March, there were no floats, no music blasting through the streets, no extravagance, body glitter and scantily clad dancers: it was a political statement and a test!
We're working against deeply ingrained social mores that have been around so long no one even remembers how they got there anymore, and a visual of loud and proud, yet naive and un-informed men and women chanting and screaming and kissing is not going to cut it.
— Kartik (name changed), social worker
People should come out and show solidarity because in one way or the other, we have all shared the same (or similar) experiences while growing up.
A young LGBT kid, unable to understand or cope with their own desires, often one feels alone. Unable to talk to someone about it coupled with the feeling of isolation potentially scars each one of us. The pride parade and consequent publication of articles, photos and media coverage of the parade can, to my mind, lend immense support to a kid struggling with his/ their own sexuality.
I sure wish the concept existed in Delhi during my adolescence.
Additionally, often times such coverage of the Pride parade tends to focus on men in drag and other elaborate attire while ignoring the huundreds of people who are from the community and at the march, the ones who choose to dress more — for lack of a better word — conservatively. While I fully support everyone's right to be themselves and dress as they wish to, the sole focus on the stereotypical ways of the parade, to my mind, takes away from the seriousness of the parade and the issues involved. As responsible citizens, the journalists/media must focus on the core issues, as opposed to just restricting their coverage to attention grabbing colorful pictures and headlines.
— Ansh* (name changed), lawyer
The word Pride itself suggests the whole purpose of why one should step out and join the march.
For someone who has ‘pride' in his/her orientation, it becomes integral to participate and send the right message; so that acceptability (and more importantly, awareness) becomes more commonplace.
— Tushar, architect
To show the world that we are not a bunch of crazy colourful people — we are doctors, engineers, artists, your co-workers, your brothers, neighbours, the person you think is your idol — for all those men hiding in the closet because YOU make me an outcast for coming out of one.
— Karan, fashion entrepreneur
Visibility.
For too long gay men and women have been poured in casts of assumed professions, temperaments, and allowed limited places in everyday lives. People need to come out to represent diversity — cis, trans, gay, straight, femme, masc, camp, or even butch... but remain unapologetic, at the end of the day. We need enough representation for younger lesbians, gays, bisexual, transgender and straight people to find a bit of themselves in us, just so no one feels alone.
For too long we have been assumed minuscule, when owning our authentic self is every person's dream.
— Anuj, consultant
Pride is not only limited to LGBT community but it is for all the oppressed sects of the society. So, if you think you are not exercising your freedom right, it is your one-way ticket to Utopia.
— Prashant, sales executive
To show people that we can protest with love and without waging a war.
But more importantly, because each voice counts.
— Vikas Narula, restaurateur
People, gay or not, should walk the Pride March this year to show that even while the country is in a state of turmoil over a movie screening that pushes India back in time back in time rather than moving forward, there's a united front that wants change and people who are ready to be a part of the process to bring that change.

The Listen Project, a program from the government of Saskatchewan for survivors of sexual violence, is now open to the public.
The program provides legal advice to those who have survived sexual violence and is hosted by the Public Legal Education Association of Saskatchewan (PLEA).

“We acknowledge that Saskatchewan has unfortunately high rates of sexual victimization and recognize sexual violence survivors often need help in responding to and overcoming such violence,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said. “The government stands with these survivors, and this program is a testament to our ongoing commitment to address the problem of sexual violence in Saskatchewan.”
Under the program, clients can receive a referral for up to two hours of free legal information and advice. Where needed, an additional two hours of free legal assistance may be approved.

“The Listen Project is designed to help survivors overcome some of the barriers in accessing the justice system by helping them understand their legal rights and options,” PLEA Executive Director Joel Janow said. “PLEA is very excited to be part of this important project and looks forward to helping survivors of sexual violence find their voice.”
As a pilot project, the program has been provided with enough funding to run until March 2021 by the Department of Justice Canada, through the Federal Justice Victims Fund.

“Sexual assault can have devastating and traumatic impacts on victims and survivors, yet is one of the most underreported crimes in Canada,” Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould said. “Our government is committed to breaking down the barriers that may discourage reporting, and to ensuring that we have the tools in place to support those who do come forward. I am very pleased that the Government of Canada is able to help fund this important initiative.”
The Listen Project handles cases that involve sexual assault, sexual harassment in the workplace and historical sexual abuse.

The program is free and has no age restrictions. There are no limitations on how much time has passed since an incident of sexual violence, the only standing limitation being that the incident must have occurred in Saskatchewan.
Incidents of sexual violence do not need to be reported to the police in order for clients to be eligible for the program.
Survivors of sexual violence can contact the program online (https://listen.plea.org/), or by phone toll-free at 1-855-258-9415.

More than 50,000 people will be present at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on the opening day of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup on Friday when hosts India will make their world cup debut across all age groups, male or female. The excitement is expected to touch fever pitch once the referee kicks-off the second game of the day.The historic moment, something all of India has been waiting for and talking about will be graced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, though they are not expected to stay for the 8 PM kick-off, which is when the Indian colts will be in action.However, a sculpture that has been set up in front of the main entrance of Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata has somehow become a topic of discussion on the social media.Conceptualised and designed by none other than the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee herself, the sculpture was set up on Thursday in front of main entrance of Salt Lake Stadium that will host 10 matches including the big final.As soon as the photos of headless sculpture hit the microblogging site, Twitterati had a field day trying to decipher it.
When Moina Shaiq realized even their friends were scared to ask them about their religion for fear of offending them or sounding uneducated, they put an advertisement in a California newspaper: “Questions and answers about being Muslim.”The ad offered ideas for questions: Are women oppressed in Islam? What is the Islamic view of terrorism? How does Islam view other religions?She set up shop at a coffee house in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Fremont, hoping for good attendance, but brought their laptop to do some work in case no one showed. To their surprise, about 100 people turned out that day last year, and their “Meet a Muslim” program was born.“It was over overwhelming,” said Shaiq, a mother of four and grandmother. “Fremont is so diverse, you will see women in hijab on the streets all the time. I didn't think people here would be interested or even need to know about Muslims.”Shaiq has since spoken about being Muslim and answered questions at dozens of libraries, pizza parlors and coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area. They recently expanded Meet a Muslim to churches, service clubs and private homes, and traveled to Arizona and Atlanta with the program.She gives the talks once or twice a week on their own time and their own dime to break down stereotypes.Similar programs emerged after 9/11, when many Muslims felt the need to engage with their fellow Americans to dispel negative perceptions of their faith. They've seen a resurgence with a recent uptick in anti-Muslim crimes.Earlier this year, for instance, Muslim and former US Marine Mansoor Shams traveled the country with a sign that read "I'm a Muslim and a US Marine, Ask Me Anything.” In Cambridge, Massachusetts, Mona Haydar and their husband set up a booth outside a library in 2015 with coffee, doughnuts and a sign that stated “Ask a Muslim.”Shaiq said they started their program to educate people about their faith and culture while addressing people's misconceptions and stereotypes.She explains the importance of the hijab (head scarf) or niqab (face covering), the differences between Sunnis and Shias (the two main sects of Islam), the rights of women in Islam, and what it's like to be an American Muslim today.At a recent Rotary club meeting in Fremont, a man asked how they think people can combat Muslim extremism. "This is where you start," Shaiq said. "You understand what the faith is."Recent anti-Muslim incidents across the US include arson attacks, vandalism, harassment and school bullying. In May, authorities in Portland, Oregon, say a man killed two men and wounded a third after they tried to stop their anti-Muslim tirade.Shaiq themselves has faced threats at their events. One man in Atlanta warned they would "slit their throat" if they said something they didn't like. They listened to the discussion, never asked a question and then left. "That was scary," Shaiq said.Muslim leaders consider the incidents part of a deeply alarming trend that came to the forefront in last year's presidential election with far-right activists portraying Islam — and all Muslims — as a threat.They see echoes of these far-right views in President Donald Trump's efforts to ban entry into the US from six Muslim-majority countries and in their claims of dangers posed by immigrants and Muslim refugees. Trump has said their policies are critical for protecting national security.Initiatives like Meet a Muslim are important at "this time of heightened fear and xenophobia," said Zainab Arain, who works to monitor and combat Islamophobia with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington, D.C.-based Muslim advocacy group. "An effective way to push back against that, especially at a local level, is to gather people and have them get to know one another."Some American Muslims, however, have struggled to see the benefit of these efforts when they see community members having the same conversations they had almost 16 years ago. "It's just not a good use of time. The likelihood of changing a bigot's mind is so low," said Asha Noor, a racial justice activist based in Detroit.Instead, Noor and other critics say the focus should be on policy change. For Shaiq, their program is about sharing a message of love, compassion and peace.Attendance at their talks spikes following news events that include Muslims, and the discussion often gets spirited, even tense and angry. “I want to proactively educate my fellow Americans that Muslims are humans just like they are," Shaiq said. "They have the same needs as anyone else.”

The 2017 Teen Choice Awards were held on Sunday evening (Aug. 13) and one major name was missing: Miley Cyrus. The singer and actor shared their apologies with fans on Instagram that evening, explaining that while they had every intention of attending the awards show to accept their trophy for The Ultimate Choice Award, their schedule simply wouldn't allow them

“To my dearest fans & all of those watching @teenchoicefox ! I want to say thank you from the very bottom of my heart for presenting me with #TheUltimateChoiceAward!” Cyrus writes. “I am beyond bummed I couldn't make it to the show as I had every intention of being there to accept and celebrate this honor! I created an unrealistic schedule for myself which leads me to this announcement!”
Then, with the grace of a veteran politician, Miley spun their apology into an act of self-promotion. “I've been tryin to keep the secret but I can't hide it any longer! My new single / music video #YoungerNow will be dropping this Friday, Aug 18th & I am sooooooo EXCITED to share it with all of you! I hope to always make people smile and shine light thru my work! I look forward to making music for the rest of my life and I'm thankful everyday for those who listen! I am sending so much love and peace into the world right now because THATS what we need most! Love Love & more LOVE!”
Cyrus wasn't the only celebrity who couldn't make it to the show. Bruno Mars accepted their Visionary Award from afar with a special video message.
Sitting on a chair in a hall that can hold up to 50 people on a laid-back Sunday morning, Gireesh recites the poem in Tamil – the intensity of it reverberating all over.
You all are well seated, occupied with work.
I have 50 steps, to cross you
and reach the lavatory
I am engrossed, unceasingly;
Keenly paying attention to you.
When you take your seat,
When you laugh,
When you speak,
I am engrossed, unceasingly;
Keenly paying attention to you.
From you I am trying to master
Walk the walk like a man
Take the seat like a man
Talk the talk
Laugh out the laugh
…Like a man
This time I will definitely
Walk like a man
These Fifty steps
I walk for fifty twisted hours
gathering all my energy
I walk the man walk
My hands shouldn't swing
My back shouldn't sway
My feet should step forward ‘straight'
I almost reached the doors
With a triumphant smile
I push the glass door, where
I see in reflections;
you all are laughing behind me
Again, I miserably failed
(Translated by Sheiji Tadokoro)
This poem from Vidupattavai (The Leftouts) – a collection of writings by Gireesh – could just be the first of its kind in the Tamil literary space.
Vidupattavai doesn't fall under any particular genre; it has poems, short stories, and responses to homophobia in the society and media. From being fatigued by social notions to challenging caste structures within the queer community, it explores a wide range of subjects.
In being so, it has emerged as a singular voice that was perhaps missing all along.
The collection has been published by Karuppu Pirathigal along with Queer Chennai Chronicles (QCC), a new forum that aims to go beyond ‘official' documents, news reports, and research studies to bring to the fore personal narratives about LGBT individuals in Tamil Nadu. “I feel that there is a lack of it,” says Moulee, one of the two people who set up QCC, “I come across many young queer people who write brilliant stuff but are unable to get it out due to various reasons. One of the primary reasons is the fear of visibility if they are not out (of the closet). Even if they are, there is the fear of backlash. Secondly, queer writing is seen as just queer writing, and the literary aspects of it are not explored by mainstream publications. The idea of LGBT lives in the mainstream is limited, and anything beyond that imagination is usually not explored.”
LJ Violet of QCC concurs. “Mainstream literary spaces rarely engage with queer writers, and these spaces are often not safe and comfortable. We wanted to create a space where new queer artists will be inspired to express themselves without the inhibitions associated with the existing mainstream and alternative literary spaces. We were talking about the queer literature that is already available on the internet in various forms, and possible ways to publish them. Many of these works cannot be tagged as novels, stories, essays or the usual formats. QCC was a way to connect these works to a wider audience without negating either the queerness or their literary value.”
Tamil literature has had its own contradictions. In the eighth century, Andal spoke of “plucking their breasts by the roots and flinging them at Their (lord Krishna's) chest”. But when women writers in the late 1990s began to write about sex and their bodies, they had to face the wrath of men of their ilk. Considering this, it was perhaps even more threatening for the queer community to put forth their voices.
But Vidupattavai cannot be termed as the first attempt at queer literature in Tamil. “There exists literature and writings in Tamil that are written by queer-identifying authors, or non-queer authors with queer characters as the focus. It would have involved a wider research to identify which of the many expressions in Tamil literature are queer, for all of them do not fit in the many definitions and perspectives we have today. But Leena Manimekalai's poems and Kutti Revathi's short story titled Pink Vodka immediately come to mind. Also, the short story Gomathi by Ki. Rajanarayanan is both widely read in general and loved within the community. Critic T Dharumaraj, in their article on writer Poomani's Anjyaadi, explores the homoerotic relationship between the main characters, and how folkloric storytelling expresses it or hides it,” explains Violet.
Leena Manimekalai says that when they came out as a bisexual in their second poetry collection Ulagin Azhagiya Muthal Penn (The Most Beautiful First Woman in the World), they were attacked by “all kinds of people”. “Even well-meaning feminists and leftists were using patriarchal words to bully me. Right-wing outfits filed police complaints pressing charges on the grounds of obscenity and offending religious sentiments. But all that only created in me a strong desire to come up with an exclusive queer poetry collection. With Antharakkanni I changed ballads from Tamil folklore and oral history rooted in binaries into lesbian renderings. I was grinding my teeth at the notion that queerness is a Western idea. I also added Tamil translations of June Jordon's I Am Not Wrong, which is regarded as being a lesbian manifesto, and many songs of the punk rock group Pussy Riot. While there was too much drama in terms of resistance with regards to my earlier collections, this one was completely silenced. Not a single literary or mainstream magazine carried a review. The debate was centered on the sexuality of the poet rather than the poetry. But I also wonder if the stronghold of Brahminical masculine binary authorship, readership and criticism is yet to be shaken and broken. Dalit and women's writing in the late 90s did manage to break the bones of the canon in Tamil literature, and I am sure queer literature will be the next fatal storm. As of now, I am happy with the growing base of my young readers who are largely queer. Most of them are still underground and struggling with their gender and sexual identities," Leena notes.
They also think Tamil literature's queer voice is still taking baby steps. “We do not have enough vocabulary in Tamil. Tamil is both impotent and ancient when it comes to radical feminist and queer writing. There should be some kind of insurgence to reinvent Tamil as a language. In reality, many brilliant people from the LGBT community who I am acquainted with are still in the process of launching themselves into writing. Taboos are too severe to navigate. When the queer community is still struggling to survive, writing and creating a voice is like fighting a war. The other major drawback is that queer discourse in Tamil civil society is still elite in nature and confined to privileged circles,” Leena says.
The transgender voice in Tamil, however, has been loud and clear for the last several years. There were books written by Living Smile Vidya, Kalki Subramaniam and Revathi A about the lives and activism of the trans-women. But Vidupattavai was important in that it could be "the first Tamil book that is gay-centric and talks about contemporary Chennai and the LGBT politics of the city.”
Violet says Vidupattavai stands out because of the way it explicitly challenges the society's dominant and oppressive notions on sexuality. “To my knowledge, it is the first book by an openly gay person, and that is important in our contemporary political and literary scenario. This should have happened earlier, but I believe the answer for why it hasn't happened can also be found in Vidupattavai. Our literary space is not completely free of the prevalent social values and norms. It explains how the dominant society sees and treats queer expressions.”
Gireesh, who hopes to keep writing, says they see their works as a weapon against the oppression or violence they have faced. “When I wrote those stories or poems, or even essays, I did not write with the hope of publishing them sometime. It was difficult to contain my writings into any genre. But once the book was published, I realised that readers could engage with it. It has different formats of writing, but it could convey to the reader ten years of a person's life. I really want my readers to see and understand this book as a writer's oppressed sexual identity. Though of course, the language may essentially differ.”
Gireesh believes their writings give them the strength to express their voice against the daily struggles of the queer community and help them gain the hope to come out of the depression that these struggles lead to.
For QCC, Vidupattavai is no one-hit wonder. Violet and Moulee hope to make literature a space consistently available for the queer community. Next on their list is an anthology by various queer voices. “We knew about a lot of queer persons with stories to tell, who haven't told them so far, for the lack of a comfortable space or a lack of confidence in their literary skills, among many other reasons. The anthology is an attempt to collect those stories in various forms (poems, stories, comics, photography) and to portray a slice of the queer history of what we know as the city of Chennai," Violet says. The anthology will be bilingual.
QCC also plans to hold Chennai's first ever queer literature fest in July. Moulee says that existing festivals have limited scope. “They are not inclusive of LGBT literature. A queer litfest would definitely bring some attention to LGBT writers, and I hope the mainstream publications and audiences identify us."
The QCC Litfest will have a special focus on queer literature in Tamil and other South Indian languages, which they believe will connect with a wider audience of queer and non-queer people who haven't engaged with it so far. Violet hopes the festival will create and sustain discussions about queer expressions in Tamil.
With that, perhaps Leena's hopes of “reading a poem unapologetically written by a working-class lesbian hailing from some remote village” could soon become a reality.

Trump is questioning the impartiality of Robert Muellers investigation and says the probe is groundless, while raising doubts about whether a fired top FBI official kept personal memos outlining their interactions with Trump. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)
WASHINGTON (AP)  President Donald Trump kept up their attack on the escalating Russia investigation, insisting in a new tweet Monday that it was a total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest! The comment came a day after a top White House lawyer tried to calm speculation that the president was considering firing the special counsel leading the probe.
White House lawyer Ty Cobb offered a statement late Sunday after top congressional Republicans warned of repercussions if Trump fired special counsel Robert Mueller, who is looking into contacts between Trumps 2016 campaign and Russia and Russian meddling in the presidential election.
In a series of weekend tweets, Trump jabbed directly at Mueller by name for the first time. The president challenged the investigations existence and suggested political bias on the part of Muellers investigators. Trump has long been frustrated by the lengthy and intensifying probe, and insists their campaign did not collude with Russia to influence the election in their favor.
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime, they said in a late Saturday tweet.

Likely contributing to Trumps sense of frustration, The New York Times reported last week that Mueller had subpoenaed the Trump Organization for Russia-related documents. Trump had said Mueller would cross a red line with such a step.
Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? they tweeted Sunday. (Continued below.)

Some of Muellers investigators indeed have contributed to Democratic political candidates, but Justice Department policy and federal service law bar discrimination in the hiring of career positions on the basis of political affiliation. Mueller is a Republican.
The tweets revived talk that Trump may, in an attempt to end the investigation, move to have Mueller fired. Cobb sought to tamp down the speculation.
In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller, they said.
Trump on Monday tweeted: A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!
Earlier Sunday, members of Congress, including some top Republicans, warned Trump to not even think about terminating Mueller.
If they tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of their presidency, said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally.
Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairperson of the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, warned Trump that a Mueller firing would be a distraction from the presidents agenda.
Let it play out its course, Gowdy said on Fox News Sunday. If youve done nothing wrong, you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said through a spokesperson that Mr. Mueller and their team should be able to do their job.
And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., tweeted that it is critical Mueller be allowed to complete a thorough investigation unimpeded.
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called for passage of stalled bipartisan bills designed to protect Mueller. They said Trump is engaged in desperate and reckless conduct to intimidate their law enforcement agencies of this country and to try and stop the special counsel. That is unacceptable in a democracy.
Trump cannot directly fire Mueller, who can only be dismissed for cause. Any dismissal would have to be carried out by Rod Rosenstein, the Trump-appointed deputy attorney general who has publicly expressed support for Mueller.
Trump has fumed to confidants that the Mueller probe is going to choke the life out of their presidency if allowed to continue unabated indefinitely, according to an outside adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with the president.
Trump has long believed that the entrenched bureaucracy, particularly at the Justice Department and FBI, is out to thwart him. They fumed to one confidant after seeing a promotion for a forthcoming book by James Comey, the FBI director they fired last year, believing Comey will seek to enrich themselves by besmirching Trumps reputation. Comeys book, A Higher Loyalty, topped Amazon.coms best-seller list on Sunday.
The president also has long been torn over how to approach the probe. Their legal team, namely Cobb, has counseled Trump to cooperate with Mueller. But some former campaign advisers have urged Trump to be combative, warning that the investigation poses an existential threat to their presidency.
Aides and friends say they understand Trumps frustration.
Marc Short, Trumps congressional liaison, said the frustration is well-warranted because there has been no evidence whatsoever of collusion.
Trump may have felt emboldened after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe on Friday, something Trump had clamored for out of a belief that McCabe was part of the entrenched, anti-Trump bureaucracy. A great day for Democracy, Trump tweeted afterward. Trump asserted without elaboration that McCabe knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!
The Associated Press later reported that McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with Trump that have been provided to Muellers office and are similar to notes compiled by Comey. Trump sought to cast doubt on their veracity, tweeting Sunday that they spent very little time with McCabe but they never took notes when they were with me.
I dont believe they made memos except to help their own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos? Trump tweeted. It wouldnt be unusual for a senior official to make notes soon after meeting with the president.
The contents of McCabes memos are unknown, but they could help substantiate McCabes assertion that they were unfairly maligned by a White House they say had declared war on the FBI and Muellers investigation.
Sessions said they dismissed McCabe on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials who said McCabe had not been candid with a watchdog office investigation. An upcoming inspector generals report is expected to conclude that McCabe had authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureaus handling of an investigation into Democrat Hillary Clintons emails.
McCabe has vigorously disputed the allegations and said their credibility came under attack as part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally but also the FBI and law enforcement.
Mueller is investigating whether Trumps actions, including Comeys ouster, constitute obstruction of justice.

LAND OF THE FREE: With music blaring, drinks being poured and guests dancing in the club vignette at the Susanne Bartsch-designed “LandauLand,” Adrienne Landau explained To Tuesday how the whole regalia came together.
Bartsch's birthday party at MoMA on Halloween gave Landau the idea to shake up their fashion show format. “Everybody was so dressed-up, wearing furs, feathers, just having the best time and they looked gorgeous,” the designer said. “I was thinking of my own show and how the girls just walk out and they don't have that attitude. So I said, ‘It's about time to throw on a fur, put on your makeup and have fun.' We're having fun and I think that's so important today.”
Two months in the making, the West 19th Street space seemed more like a club nearing dawn. After helping to hoist a wedding gown-wearing model onto a horse mannequin, Bartsch said the project required “hours of work,” without the slightest trace of irony. “It looks so effortless, but it's a lot of work to get everybody together, to do the sets, make sure things work, I love it. This has been a lot of fun to do.”
The trickiest part is to keep everybody in place. They're all running around,” they said. “I don't really plan so much. I see something and think, ‘Oh this will work with that.' I create it as I see it. I don't go out planning to find a horse. I work with what there is. I am very good at working with what there is.”
Love and being together was the theme of the equestrian bride, the future was meant to be relayed by the children playing amidst scantily clad models and spirituality was the message of Egyptian dancers, Bartsch said. Climate change was hinted at via a beach scene and working girls (as in the nocturnal streetwalking kind) were other messages. “This is real life. This is what happens in real life,” Bartsch said. “We have the wedding, we have the children, we have the street art, we have global warming and being worried about the world, the working girls, the club where you can relax and let it all hang out and spirituality.”
Bartsch themselves planned to turn in early Tuesday night, since no after party was planned. “I have too much going on. We are at the final stages of my documentary [with Anthony and Alex of No Weather Productions]. We're going to L.A. now to finish up the music. It should be out in April,” they said. “I'm doing a fashion event in Miami. I still do parties and I want to work on a stage show that keeps on going.”
For the first time Friday night fans at Berkeley County's largest high school had a new rule.
The “Clear Bag or No Bag” entry procedure was put in place at Goose Creek High School's game against Fort Dorchester.
Live 5 News witnessed several students, parents, and fans walking up to the gates to get in without realizing the new procedure was put in place.
Those who didn't have their belongings in a clear bag were not allowed entry, unless they had a small clutch or wallet.
School officials said the goal is to keep everyone as safe as possible.
One woman filled their plastic bag with their belongings, following the rule in the first night it was implemented.
"I think it gives everybody relief as far as what to expect from everybody and know that no one is out to get anyone, you can see your items in the bag,” a Goose Creek mom said.
Even the plastic bags coming through the gate were checked as well as folding chairs and small wallets.
This procedure will be in place from now on and the hope is to have it permanent every school district-wide next year.
School officials working security said for the first night of the policy, things ran well.

A whale survey aircraft found the whale, named "Ruffian," about 20 miles east of Cumberland Island. The whale was entangled with heavy fishing rope through their mouth. Rescuers got to them just before dark and attached a tracking buoy. The rescuers returned the next day and successfully freed Ruffian. Ruffian had been carrying more than 450 feet of commercial fishing rope and a 135-lb. trap/pot.
Spanish Olympic champion Mireia Belmonte Garcia has made the decision to continue swimming through the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. The Spanish swimming federation has confirmed their decision.
Belmonte has been regarded as one of the best Spanish swimmers in history since 2012. At the London Olympics, they became the only Spanish swimmer ever to win multiple medals at a single Olympic game. Them success continued in the lead up to the Rio Olympics, as they continued to earn a place on the podium at high level meets such as the 2013 World Championships and 2014 Short Course World Championships.
Belmonte battled with a shoulder injury in 2015, forcing them to pull out of the Mare Nostrum Tour, Spanish Summer Nationals, and 2015 World Championships. Despite concerns about how this injury would impact their performance in Rio, they returned to the Olympic stage better than ever. They once again earned multiple Olympic medals for Spain, but this time one of them was gold. In the women's 200 fly, Belmonte ran down Australia's Madeline Groves, touching them out by tenths at the finish.
At the 2016 Short Course World Championships last month, Belmonte had a tough time due to bronchitis. It's safe to say we could still see more fast swimming from them in the future, though, as we now know to look out for them until Tokyo rolls around.
New babies seem to have two jobs: to eat and to sleep. Sometimes they throw in a little crying just for fun. Comedian Steven Wright once joked that when looking for a baby gift, they wanted to give a shirt that read, "Still tired from the move." While there's something strangely entrancing about watching your baby sleep, it can feel like they are doing nothing else, and you might wonder why babies sleep so much and how much sleep is actually normal?
The National Sleep Foundation recommended that newborns get 14-17 hours of sleep a day, infants get 12-15 hours, and that toddlers clock in 11-14 hours of ZZZs a day. As more seasoned parents know, even within "normal" there is bound to be some variation, so don't compare your baby to your best friend's baby. Some are going to fall into that 14-17 hour parameter, some will sleep a little less and some even more. While 14-17 hours sounds like a lot, it can seem less so when your baby is sleeping in spurts and up several times a night... probably because they're hungry. (To give you an example, breastfed newborn may feed 10 to 12 times a day, according to KellyMom.)
If an adult needs eight hours of sleep, why is it that a new baby seems to need a whole lot more? Well, because it's their job. The most important thing they can do right now is grow and develop. The American Sleep Association (ASA) said, "A lot of sleep is important for newborns and is one of the most important things for growth and development." The ASA explained that this is crucial for their physical and psychological growth, and that the human growth hormone is released while they are sleeping.
It also may just feel like your baby is sleeping more if the bulk of their sleep is happening during the daytime. As Baby Center explained, newborns often have their days and nights mixed up, and much to parents' frustration, babies can be nocturnal. Kim West, known as "The Sleep Lady and author of the book, The Sleep Lady's Good Night, Sleep Tight, told Parents that newborns haven't yet established their own circadian rhythms of melatonin production. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles.
As they get older this will develop, and you can also work to shift their schedules and hopefully reclaim a little of your own sleep. Deborah Lin-Dyken, a pediatric sleep disorder specialist, suggested to Baby Center that parents who want to shift their baby's sleep cycle should take steps that include establishing a wake-up time and sticking to it, even if it means waking your baby. They also suggested waking your baby for feedings and creating dark environments for sleep time and more light-filled and music-filled environments when they should be awake. However, some professionals, like Dr. Marc Weissbluth, a pediatrician and author of Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child, don't feel you should wake a sleeping baby to eat and that evening feedings are usually temporary and will improve with time. You should choose what you are most comfortable with.
Here's one thing you should not do: Nemours' Kids Health website advised parents not to keep their babies awake during the day in hopes it'll have them sleep better at night. They said this could actually backfire and cause you to have an overtired baby, which might make it even harder for them to fall asleep at night.
As much as it seems like newborns sleep a ton, now you know that there is actually a lot happening while your baby is getting them ZZZs. And before you know it, they'll be on a sleep schedule that is more conducive to your lifestyle (i.e. sleep through the night in one long stretch). Until then, you have a new appreciation for the term "sleep like a baby."

The country slipped one place after climbing from 20th to 15th in last year's edition of the annual ranking published by the Lausanne, Switzerland-based International Institute for Management and Development (IMD).
Finland is the 16th most competitive country in the world, according to the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking 2018.
Petri Rouvinen, the research director at the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (Etla), reminds in an interview with Helsingin Sanomat that the drop falls within the margin of error of the survey and is therefore not necessarily indicative of a trend of any kind.
“Also the fact that Finland's employment situation has improved for three consecutive quarters has only had little time to have an impact on the ranking,” adds Rouvinen.
The United States overtook Hong Kong to re-claim its position at the top of the IMD World Competitiveness Ranking. The top-five was rounded out by Singapore, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
Denmark, Sweden and Norway all similarly ranked ahead of Finland, coming in 6th, 8th, and 9th respectively in what was already the 30th edition of the ranking.
The IMD World Competitiveness Ranking ranks a total of 63 economies around the world based on their ability to create a competitive business environment and, as a result, foster prosperity and generate revenues.

SHIKARPUR - Around 18-hour power breakdown in Shikarpur district on Sunday brought life to a standstill.
According to reports, the breakdown occurred when 14 feeders stopped functioning due to technical issues at around 3AM. The residents of Shikarpur have strongly condemned such tactics by WAPDA and demanded the high-ups to take notice of prolonged power outages, saying their businesses and other activities are badly hit due to this.
And there was complete darkness when this scribe was filing the story.
Is there no honour amongst taggers?
I don't understand why someone decided it was a good idea to tag the beautiful hand-painted mural in the 2100-block of East Hastings. Sadly, this is the second mural defaced at this location.
The first mural was tagged so badly that the business owner had no choice but to paint over it. I was so pleased to see this new mural appear a number of months back in exactly the same location where the previous mural had been proudly displayed for many years.
To whomever needlessly and selfishly defaced this mural, grow up and keep your tagging off public art installations!

Incompetent management
Having had total control of our motor vehicle insurance for decades and admitting that they have failed miserably at their job, ICBC now wants to raise rates again. Seems that admission of failure stems primarily from overpaying management personnel who have not done their jobs effectively.
This senior can recall when the corporation issued cheques to British Columbians when they had a surplus as a result of competent management. Since then, no cheques, just rates hikes for lower-quality service.
Compare your motor vehicle/home insurance available here to other areas. In Arizona, for instance, home and vehicle insurance is bundled together. It's a common practice where open competition is allowed and encouraged by government, resulting in lower rates to the consumer.
It's not allowed in B.C. as the provincial powers found it convenient to “balance” the provincial budget with ICBC surpluses. If we had a competitive market, a lot of consumers would benefit from the competition and a lot of incompetents would be looking for work.
Allan Wrightson, Ladner
Libs should pay
ICBC's financial woes stem from the siphoning off of the huge reserves it was forced to build up by the Liberals — at least $1.2 billion. The B.C. Liberal party should be held responsible and pay back the money.
The Liberals have a long history of using taxpayers' money to pay for questionable ads that were more to puff the party than anything else.
Greg Middleton, Victoria
Cheaper meds needed
Dr. Diane McIntosh rightly points out in their op-ed that lack of access to modern medications compromises the care of B.C. patients. We do not have access to the best medications, and often patients cannot afford them.
Rather than just paying for doctors and hospitals, we need to fund medications, psychologists and other health-care providers. Timely access to medications would improve the health of British Columbians. Let's hope the new government addresses this issue in a timely fashion.
Dr. Derryck Smith, clinical professor emeritus, University of B.C.
NDP wrong on pipelines
It is very upsetting that the new NDP government is trying to overturn the decision made by both the federal and previous provincial governments to twin the Kinder Morgan pipeline. Consulting with First Nations and safety requirements on both land and sea had already been met by the prime minister to arrive at their decision.
This is a federal issue that benefits the entire country and not a provincial decision. Also, it would create thousands of jobs.
How would the B.C. NDP feel if all softwood lumber had to travel through Alberta yet shipments were halted because of a new provincial party in Alberta?
Frank Townsley, Coquitlam

Malaysia has banned a controversial Bollywood film, citing its negative portrayal of a Muslim ruler.
The release of Padmaavat has already caused mayhem in India.
The 14th century period drama focuses on the tale of Muslim King Alauddin Khilji, Rajput ruler Ratan Singh, and Hindu queen Padmavati.
Hindu groups in India alleged the film distorts history by depicting Rajput queen Padmini – the protagonist of the film – in a poor light.
Protesters in the South Asian country took to the streets to demand the movie was not screened there, but eventually lost their bid after the Supreme Court rejected a bid to ban the film.
In an unexpected twist, Malaysia's Ministry of Home Affairs on Friday said the film would not be screened in nationwide cinemas, rejecting the way in which Alauddin Khilji was depicted.
“He is portrayed as a sultan who is arrogant, cruel, inhumane, devious with all kinds of trickery, unreliable and who does not fully practise Islamic teachings,” the ministry said in a statement, according to The Straits Times.
Malaysia's Film Censorship Board ruled that the movie was “not approved for screening”.
A trailer for Padmaavat shows the Muslim sultan as a man with an aggressive expression, their face dirtied by blood and mud.
Bollywood films are popular in Malaysia. Ethnic Indians comprise 7 percent of Malaysia, a majority Muslim country of 32 million people.
The censorship board has previously banned films with religious themes, such as the 2014 biblical drama Noah, and movies with sexual content, such as Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015.

The recently concluded successful 18th summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization(SCO) in East China's Shandong province will put far-reaching impacts on regional and global politics. During the summit, leaders of SCO nations discussed regional and international hotspot issues as reflected in much awaited “Qingdao Declaration” and succeeded to evolve consensus for promotion of regional peace, stability and development.
Leaders of the SCO member states signed or witnessed the signing of 23 cooperation documents covering politics, security, economics and culture.
The leadership of SCO member countries vowed to strengthen their cooperation in the fight against terrorism, separatism, extremism and cross-border crimes.
The United States' “self-centered, shortsighted and closed-door policies” were rejected and criticized. These policies are not only creating uncertainty but also producing troubles for the smooth functioning of global economy.
In their coveted speech in the summit, President Xi Jinping rejected these unfair policies and talked against rising unilateralism and protectionism at global level.
The promotion of unilateralism and protectionism for the sake of one country's vested interests are detrimental to the entire international system as these policies are putting global economy again in danger. These policies have formed unfair global system, produced instability and contributed negatively for the world.
President Xi Jinping's announcement of a 30-billion-yuan special lending facility within the framework of the SCO Inter-bank Consortium is a crucial step for enhancing trade among SCO members, economic development, promotion of multilateralism and cooperation at regional and global level to form a fair, just and equitable international system. This step will also be helpful in curbing unilateralism and protectionism at global level.
In today's world of globalization, unilateralism based on one country-centered policy cannot work because the interests of the countries are now interconnected and correlated.
The summit will also affect China's proposed Belt and Road Initiative in a positive manner. If SCO member states remained successful in implementation of the decisions and agreements in full letter and spirit then security environment in the region will be improved.
The Belt and Road Initiative, contrary to unilateralism has received great support across the globe because it is based on the golden principle of win-win cooperation, mutual benefit and common development.
Pakistan and India for the first time attended the SCO summit as full members and it is being termed as a major development in the history of the organization.
With the inclusion of Pakistan and India, the eight-member group now accounts for more than 60 percent of the Eurasian landmass and nearly half of the world's population and over 20 per cent of global GDP.
This has produced SCO's vast international influence and it has increased the expectations of the international community and people of the region from this platform.
Participation of both rival countries Pakistan and India in SCO remained in heated debate among the experts during the summit. The questions like whether both countries will be baggage for SCO due to their outstanding issues or they will give more strength to this organization remained under discussion.
Experts in China, Pakistan and India believe that SCO has created new opportunities for India and Pakistan to improve their bilateral relationship. Participation of Pakistan and India for the first time in “Peace Mission”, the military exercise in Russia under the aegis of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is also being considered as an unusual and important development. Two big players in the organization, China and Russia may push forward Pakistan and India to improve their bilateral relations by resolving outstanding issue amicably. It is the high time for the Pakistan and India to adopt saner approach and move forward to resolve all outstanding issues including core issue of Kashmir and utilize their potential to defeat abject poverty, security related and other challenges.
Pakistan wants good relations with all countries including its neighbors and it always welcomes ‘tangible and result oriented and concrete efforts' to resolve all outstanding issues peacefully. If India has shown seriousness, then both countries can move forward towards resolution of their outstanding problems and can contribute to the regional peace and development.
South Asia is facing instability due to unresolved historical problems including Kashmir Issue between India and Pakistan and continuous unrest in Afghanistan.
In the prevailing scenario, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has become a new hope for regional peace, stability and development.
SCO has already contributed a lot for the peace and stability of the Central Asian region. This successful experience of SCO can be applied to bring peace and stability in the South Asia. The creation of Afghanistan Contact Group under SCO to resolve lingering Afghan issue is a step in right direction.
Years long ongoing military operation in Afghanistan has failed to bring peace and stability in this war ravaged country. The resolution of Afghanistan problem is imperative for the peace and stability in the region. All SCO member countries should help Afghanistan in bringing peace and stability.
Stability in Afghanistan is in the greater interest of the entire region including Pakistan. Instability in Afghanistan has also badly affected Pakistan. The stability in South Asia also is imperative for the smooth implementation of Belt and Road Initiative projects. China by adding South Asia in its proposed Belt and Road Initiative has created massive opportunities of trade and economic development for these countries.
It is responsibility of South Asian countries to work collectively for the peace and stability in the region and support China's policies under Belt and Road Initiative for the common development, peace and prosperity.
Participation of the Pakistan in SCO is very important for it. As far as regional and internal security is concerned, Pakistan has already fought a long war against terrorism as a front-line state. Pakistan has sacrificed a lot in this war. More than 70 thousand civilians, law enforcement agencies officers and men have sacrificed their lives for elimination of menace of terrorism. According to some estimates, it suffered around $123.1 billion on account of loss of lives, economic opportunities and damage to the country's infrastructure.
Pakistan has taken military action indiscriminately and achieved a great success in dismantling and cleaning terrorists' hideouts. This achievement shows Pakistan's resolve and contribution to the internal and regional peace and stability.
Now Pakistan will be able to consolidate these gains with SCO's support and experience and it will also be able to share its experience with the organization. SCO membership will add more opportunities for Pakistan to further strengthen its political and trade relationship with Central Asian states.
Pakistan being an active member of Belt and Road Initiative will further strengthen its economy and law and order situation. Pakistan will play its active role to work closely with members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to promote regional peace and development.
Let's hope that SCO will become stronger in future and will play its due role in resolving regional and international problems and contribute well to the peace, stability and prosperity of the region.

Turkey's holiday resort province Antalya, which is aiming for 14 million tourists this year, has seen nearly 3 million foreigners come to the city just from airports as of May 28.
Leaving behind the figures of 2015-2017, these figures also broke the 2014 record, which is considered the best year in tourism for the city, when 2.68 million tourists came, while this number reached 2.69 million with the addition of 2,651 passengers this year.
The number of tourists coming to the city via Antalya and Gazipaşa irports reached 2.7 million as of Monday, May 28. There was also an increase of 47 percent between Jan. 1 and May 28 compared to the same period the previous year, surpassing 2015-2016 figures. From both airports, 2.5 million tourists came in 2015, 1.5 million in 2016, known as the worst season, and 1.9 million tourists in 2017, regarded as the recovery season.
Antalya broke the record of 2014, known as the best period in tourism while leaving behind three years before even completing the first five months of 2018. 2.683 million tourists came to the city via airports in 2014, while this number reached around 2.686 million with the addition of 2,651 passengers.
In addition, the number of daily landings at Antalya and Gazipaşa airports was 52,000.
Meanwhile, the number of tourists arriving from Gazipaşa Airport as of May 28 reached 60,662. The number of tourists, which was 23,441 according to 28-day data in May 2017, increased almost twice in the same period of 2018 to 43,276.
The International Olympic Committee on Friday provisionally suspended Brazil's national Olympic chief Carlos Nuzman following their arrest in a $2 million vote-buying scandal.The IOC stripped Nuzman of their honorary membership and removed them from the coordination committee for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.It also suspended Brazil's Olympic Committee, although it said the country's athletes were unaffected and would be allowed to take part in next year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and will continue to receive scholarship funds.Nuzman, 75, was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday as part of a probe into allegations they helped buy votes from the IOC to secure Rio's hosting of the 2016 Games.The IOC said it had made its decision because Nuzman was "responsible for the candidature of Rio de Janeiro in 2009" when IOC members held a vote in Copenhagen to decide the 2016 Olympics host city.Brazilian officials said last month Nuzman was the "lynchpin" in a plot to bribe the IOC into awarding Rio the Games.At the time, Nuzman was detained and questioned and authorities confiscated their passport.Authorities allege that former Rio governor Sergio Cabral, who is serving a 14-year prison term for bribery and money laundering, masterminded the plot.Investigators believe $2 million (1.7m euros) in bribes was paid to Papa Massata Diack, the son of Senegalese IOC member and former world athletics chief Lamine Diack, before the 2009 vote.Businessman Arturo Soares, nicknamed "King Arthur", a top contractor for Cabral's administration, allegedly delivered the payment three days before the vote.Rio beat bids from Chicago, Madrid and Tokyo to host the 2016 games.The Rio 2016 committee's chief operating officer Leonardo Gryner was arrested in a separate raid in Rio on Thursday.Prosecutors say Nuzman's assets increased 457 percent over the past decade with no clear source for the new income.Nuzman also tried to conceal their wealth, often hiding it in foreign accounts, the statement read.He only declared they owned 16 gold bars weighing one kilogramme (2.2 pounds) each when they were questioned a month ago, prosecutors said.The gold is stored in a depository in Geneva.The office of Switzerland's attorney general said on Friday it was "currently analysing" a request from Brazil for legal assistance in the case.In a statement, the IOC said that "to protect the interests of the Brazilian athletes" the decision had no bearing on the country's teams."Therefore, the IOC will accept a Brazilian Olympic Team in the Olympic Winter Games Pyeongchang 2018," it said.Rio 2016 was credited with being a sporting and organisational success, but revelations of massive corruption during the preparations and now even in the awarding of the Games have tarnished the legacy.

A judge set a surety bond of $10,000 for a Mount Pleasant martial arts instructor Friday morning.
James Buchen was recently re-arrested and accused of second-degree assault and battery.
New court documents indicate that Buchen asked the victim to walk to their car after class. After that, the report details how they supposedly held their tight, groped them and rubbed themselves up against them
"All the things they did to me were so wrong," the victim said in bond court Friday. "I never want anyone to have to experience the same things."
Several people showed up in support of both the defendant and the alleged victim.
"He has never been in trouble before," Buchen's attorney Alex Toporek said in court today. "He has absolutely zero criminal record."
The new bond comes after they were booked in jail earlier this month and accused of sexually assaulting two of their students. The bond concerning the preliminary charges was set at $300,000 on charges of second-degree sexual conduct with a minor and third-degree sexual conduct with a minor.
A background check on Buchen revealed that prior to the previous sexual assault accusations from two weeks ago, their record was clean.
That's why former teaching partner of eight years Justin Watchendorf was so surprised.
"I believe their integrity and I would never believe them to make up anything," Watchendorf said. "Their pain was going through my mind.
Previously released court documents show Buchen acknowledged that it was inappropriate to massage one of the victims. According to authorities, one victim said they were intimidated by Buchen and afraid to tell anyone what happened to them
Dee Norton Child Advocacy Center executive director Carole Swiecicki said there are several signs parents should watch out for in regards to incidents of assault.
"Parents can look for changes in their child's behavior as a possible sign that the child has experienced abuse," Swiecicki. "If they were happy and kind of enjoyed going to an activity, and suddenly they're seeming much more withdrawn and sad and now wanting to go, changes in those behaviors can be an indicator to the parent that something has happened."
Swiecicki also said parents should understand that sometimes the only sign parents can pick up on is the child telling them.
If your child suffers from a case of abuse, Swiecicki recommended you contact the Dee Norton center. They said the center has programs and resources that can help children and their families during difficult times.

One person was taken to the hospital after a single vehicle rollover accident early Saturday evening. The accident took place on December 9, sround 4:36 p.m. on Route 20 W., about a half mile east of Imbus Road.
According to deputies, 20-year-old Hunter Gruel of East Dubuque lost control of the vehicle they were driving on a curve and drove into the ditch. The vehicle rolled over multiple times before coming to rest in the middle of the road, blocking both lanes of traffic.
Gruel and their two passengers were checked by first responders. Officials say 21-year-old Riley Kuhl of Hazel Green, Wis. was taken to the hospital with unreported injuries.
Gruel was ticketed for failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident and Kuhl was ticketed for failure to wear a seatbelt/passenger.
The new concert film Horses: Patti Smith And Them Band captures Patti Smith performing the classic album Horses in full in Los Angeles, to celebrate that album's 40th anniversary. Last night, the movie had its big premiere at New York's Beacon Theatre, as part of the Tribeca Film Festival. Smith and their band performed at the premiere, playing a short set that included a cover of Buffalo Springfield's “For What It's Worth.” And they also brought out a couple of famous friends to join them
First up was Bruce Springsteen, who came out onstage to the sort of cheers that must happen everytime Springsteen shows up anywhere, especially in the New York tristate area. Springsteen sang and played guitar on “Because The Night,” the 1978 song, which Smith and Springsteen co-wrote and which remains Smith's best-known song.
Springsteen also stuck around for the show-closing rendition of Smith's 1988 song “People Have The Power,” which Smith dedicated to the kids from Parkland, Florida who are lobbying to change our nutso gun laws. (Smith also recently sang the song on The Tonight Show.) And Smith's close friend and booster Michael Stipe, the former R.E.M. frontman, also came out to help sing the song. It's a measure of Smith's elemental power, as a performer, that neither Springsteen nor Stipe overshadowed them Below, watch fan-made videos of those two performances.
And while we're at it, here's a trailer for Horses: Patt Smith And Them Band:
Horses: Patti Smith And Them Band will be streaming on Apple Music 5/22.
A marathon of hockey from April 6 to 9 resulted in positive memories of a lifetime for local indigenous youth.
The tournament dubbed the “Stanley Cup of Indigenous Minor Hockey” led to the EMS Midget Oilers and Elizabeth Northern Selects Pee-wee Girls teams to win gold medals at the 2017 Alberta Native Provincials held in Edmonton recently.
The 2017 Alberta Native Provincials is the largest all indigenous tournament comprised of 250 teams from communities across the province.
Our community should be proud of our local indigenous athletes and what they've accomplished as it's a first to bring home both gold medals as top teams in their divisions and the province.
The teams are comprised of local youth ages 11-18 with both teams going undefeated playing 11 games total.
The Midget Oilers went 6-0 outscoring opponents 42-7 and the Girls Northern Selects went 5-0 outscoring opponents 54-1.
The boys competed against 24 other teams in their division going 30-0 in pool play advancing to bracket play on April 8 with wins 4-2 vs. Sucker Creek, 4-2 vs. Sturgeon Lake and 3-2 vs. Kikino to win the Gold on finals on April 9.
The Pee-wee girls went 48-0 vs. Calling Lake, Alexis, Stoney Sioux and Edmonton in five games leading up to the final vs. Enoch winning Gold with a 6-1 final score.
A special thank you to everyone who supported the teams including the sponsors and to the team managers, brother and sister Chris Desjarlais and Kelly Steinhauer, and the coaches and trainers who made it all happen for these kids.
A nod to our few sponsors who also supported the teams and helped our young athletes.

Arthur B. Rubinstein, composer for films such as “War Games” who worked on more than 300 films and television programs, died April 23 of complications resulting from cancer. They were 80.
In the 1960s, Rubinstein composed incidental music for around 50 productions while serving as composer-in-residence for the American Conservatory Theater, the Williamstown Theater Festival, and the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. They continued on in the 1970s serving as a music director, both in Los Angeles and on Broadway, for shows such as “A Chorus Line,” “Jesus Christ Superstar,” and “Evita.” Rubinstein received an L.A. Drama Critics Circle Award for their work as music director on Gordon Davidson's production of “A Little Night Music.”
After moving to Los Angeles, Rubinstein composed scores for films such as “WarGames” (1983) starring Matthew Broderick, and Albert Brooks' “Lost in America” (1985). Rubinstein earned an Emmy Award for their original music on CBS series “Scarecrow and Mrs. King.” They also scored “Shooting War,” Stephen Spielberg's documentary narrated by Tom Hanks about WWII newsreel cameramen for ABC Television.
Rubinstein was also a frequent collaborator with director John Badham, working on films including “Whose Life Is It Anyway?” (1981), “Blue Thunder” (1983), “Stakeout” (1987) featuring Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez, “The Hard Way” (1991), “Another Stakeout” (1993), and “Nick of Time” (1995) with Christopher Walken and Johnny Depp.
In 1994, Rubinstein founded Symphony in the Glen with their wife Barbara Ferris. They presented over 60 free classical concerts to over 80,000 families and children in Los Angeles across their 20-year run.
Rubinstein's most recent compositions include “Observations,” which premiered in 2009 at the Griffith Observatory in a special concert in honor of the International Year of the Astronomer and the 400th anniversary of Galileo's achievements.
“In classical music and jazz there is a constant, living swirl of wonder and discovery — both sensual and intellectual. As a composer and conductor, I've always tried, in some way, to be part of that swirl,” Rubinstein wrote on their website.
Rubinstein is survived by their wife, Barbara Ferris Rubinstein, and their daughter, Alexandra Nan Rubinstein.

Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State has launched the state Vigilance Service to complement the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies operating in the State in the detection and prevention of crimes in neighbourhoods and communities.
Represented by the deputy governor, Arch. Bala Yusuf Barnabas, the governor said officers of the Kaduna State Vigilance Service will work closely with the Nigeria Police, the Civil Defence, the State Security Service and the Military, particularly in areas of intelligence sharing.
el-Rufai, explained that their government is committed to stopping the hoodlums and miscreants that menace urban centres, and the bandits that threaten peace and harmony in rural communities.
The governor revealed that, the security agencies have effected mass arrests of these urban hoodlums, “and we hope that the judicial process metes out appropriate punishment to them”
el-Rufai, however warned that government will not allow any illegal group to use the provision of security as cover to perpetrate mayhem in the state.
“This agency represents another step government is taking to enhance security in our state, to give our people greater confidence as they work hard to take care of themselves and their families. The Vigilance Service has been established to help improve security in our neighbourhoods, putting more on the ground to deter and respond to threats.
In establishing a Vigilance Service, the Kaduna State is once again making a concrete investment in securing its people. The Vigilance Service will complement the existing security and law enforcement agencies which are all federal assets. The Kaduna State Government has consistently supported these agencies, from providing vehicles, and other assistance, to actually funding operations undertaken by these federal assets.”
“Judging from the wide coverage, security is one of the big challenges of our time. Yet any familiarity with the issue, beyond the headlines that tell painful stories of loss, injury and sometimes displacement, is the cold fact that our police is undermanned. As a consequence, our country is so severely underpoliced that the gaps are too easily exploited by criminals.
While waiting for critical policy changes like funding a mass recruitment of police officers and decentralizing the police, we must take steps within the law to strengthen security in our state, coupled with supporting the work of the federal police. Therefore, in 2016 the Kaduna State Government established the Vigilance Service by law”
“May I use the formal launch of the Kaduna State Vigilance Service to warn that this Service is established by law is the only state government owned and recognized security body. We call for the utmost public cooperation with its officers.
The law has no space for Vigilante Bodies like the Kato da Gora, Civilian JTF, CESSCUR, Neighbourhood Watch, Vigilante Group of Nigeria, Extreme Security, Jarumai da Gora, Yan Committee, Ujumeme, Yan Tuba and others. Government has advised the Nigeria Police and other Security Agencies to arrest and prosecute any person operating under any of these bodies. People who used to belong to these bodies are hereby called upon to join hands with the Kaduna Vigilance Service forthwith” the governor said.
Review: Despicable Me 3
(PG) Steve Carell, Trey Parker, Miranda Cosgrove & Pierre Coffin
It's been seven years since the original invasion of Gru (Steve Carell) and their Minions (Pierre Coffin) and the Illumination Studios have made a cottage industry of the villain and their adoptive family. The original film provided an endearing look into the life of a ‘bad guy' and how these cute sisters could help them find their good side. Since this initial introduction, the popularity of Gru and girls has been eclipsed by the bald yellow creatures led by Kevin, Stuart and Dave. After a brief stint with their own film, the whole Gru crew is back for Despicable Me 3, with the expansion of the villainous family.
Gru and Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) are partners in fighting villains and in life as husband and wife. They are agents of the Anti-Villain League (ANL), but the 80's inspired super-villain Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) continually eludes their grasp. Even with their stellar record in keeping the world safe from these scoundrels who desire world domination, the unassuming dynamic duo are let go from the agency. They not only lose their positions with ANL, but in the process the Minions decide to leave Gru behind for a life of crime. While Gru's family comes to terms with their unexpected dismissal and the betrayal of the yellow horde, Gru finds out that they have a long-lost brother, Dru (Steve Carell). This family reunion leads Gru to make a decision, to return to a life of villainy or to stay true to Lucy and their girls and find a way to bring Bratt to justice.
This is a franchise that has diminished in cinematic value with each instalment, but the team at Illumination Studios have managed to find the niche that will keep the Minion army on screen, the kindergarten crowd. Director of Minions, Kyle Balda, and co-director of the original film, Pierre Coffin, provides something for this miniature fan base and their parents to enjoy. The younger set gets the slapstick humour and silliness of Gru and their villainous munchkins, while the parents are thrown nostalgic memories of the 80's. None of it has the touching moments that made the first film a runaway hit, but it gives parents a relatively safe option during the school holidays. The gags do run thin after a while, but they do manage to keep the family element as a central theme. This makes for some fun hijinks with very little originality.
For the fans of this franchise, the inclusion of a long-lost twin does seem to be a writer's stretch for a new plot. Thankfully there are no political or spiritual agendas being pushed throughout this film, which can be a trend the longer a franchise goes. The heart of the film is bringing families together, regardless of how bizarre the circumstances that occur around the familial unit. Similar to the experience with Minions, most adults may not understand the appeal of this curious lot of characters. The thing that is convincing is in the sound of the children's laughter, which may be perplexing, but it can make the screening of this film bearable.
What should parents know about Despicable Me 3?
There really are not too many warnings from this film. There are a couple of scenes where Gru and the Minions lose their clothing, but it is all innocent and handled with care. The themes stay pretty close to the original film, but with some subtle nuances.

Four shops in Farnborough have been caught selling alcohol to people underage without checking for identification.
Licensing officers from Rushmoor Borough Council have linked up with Hampshire Police to check on sales of alcohol to underage young people in Farnborough.
Test purchases were carried out at 15 off-licences in the town during Wednesday (8 February), with four premises failing when they sold alcohol to 16-year-old girl without asking for identification.
The council's licensing team and the police are now working with the premises that failed the test purchases to prevent this happening again, including offering training for the staff members involved. The off-licences will continue to be monitored closely.
Similar test purchases were carried out in Aldershot town centre in the run-up to Christmas, with four premises warned for selling booze to those underage.
Councillor Ken Muschamp, Rushmoor Borough Council's deputy leader and Cabinet member for business, safety and regulation, said: “Our officers will be working closely with the police to make sure there is no repeat of these illegal alcohol sales, so we will not be naming them at this time.
"However, I want to emphasise that we will be keeping a close eye on these premises and we will not hesitate to take further action if they do not make improvements.”
Telugu actor Vijay Sai's wife booked for abetment to suicide along with two others
Telugu actor Vijay Sai on 11 December committed suicide and hours later, police booked their wife and two others for abetment to suicide. The 35-year-old was found hanging from the ceiling fan in their flat in Yousufguda neighborhood, police said.
Police recovered a video taken by them on their mobile phone before ending their lives, in which they allegedly blamed their wife and two others for driving them to the extreme.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Venkateshwar Rao said the selfie video was sent for forensic examination. Vijay Sai and their wife Vanita were living separately for two years and had also filed for a divorce in a court. They have a daughter.
On a complaint by Vijay's father Subba Rao, police registered a case against Vanita, lawyer Srinivas and Sashidhar. The police officer said they were investigating the relations between Vanita and Sashidhar.
Police were also trying to identify the people the actor last spoke to over phone or met personally. Vijay's parents alleged that they were under mental stress due to the behaviour of theirs wife.
Vanita, however, dismissed the allegations against them They alleged that Vijay had even beaten them up on some occasions but they never revealed this.
They broke down on reaching Osmania Hospital, where the body was kept for autopsy. They told reporters that they failed to understand why Vijay took the extreme step when the divorce case was pending in the court.
Vijay made their debut with the movie Ammayilu Abbayilu in 2003. Later they played a comedian in movies like Current, Vara Prasad Potti Prasad, Bommarillu, Okariki Okaru, Brindavanam and Mr Manmadha. Their last film was Dhanalaxmi Talupu Tadite, which was released in 2015.
Kaleigh McGrady, who trains with Dynamo Swim Club and attends Dunwoody High School in the Atlanta area, has announced their verbal commitment to Washington University in St. Louis.
McGrady is a sprint freestyler, and they competed at the Georgia 1-5A High School Championships in 2016 as a sophomore. There, they placed 5th in the 100 freestyle, and anchored Dunwoody High School's 200 free relay (24.24) to a state championship. They also anchored Dunwoody's 400 free relay to a state title.
TOP TIMES
50y free – 24.27
100y free – 52.78
50m free – 27.83
100m free – 59.98
200y IM – 2:09.82
McGrady will start up with WashU in the fall. The Bears are a powerhouse program in the NCAA's Division III– last year, they were able to place 6th at the NCAA D3 Championships. Them best time in the 50 free would've landed them in the B final at the 2017 UAA Conference Championships, not far off of the 23.92 it took to make the A final. In the 100 free, they would've also made the UAA B final last year, again not very far off of the 52.40 it took to make the A final in prelims.
WashU just graduated two of their four 200 free relay legs, as well as one of their 400 free relay legs from the 2017 NCAA Champs. Both relays scored in the A final. McGrady could be a candidate to join the relays, especially considering two additional members of the 400 free relay from last year's NCAAs are now seniors and will have graduated before McGrady gets to campus.
Remember to send in your photos! We have some shots from a new contributor, Robert Ashton. Their notes are below:
Photos taken outside Beaumaris Castle, built at the very end of the 13th century. In #1 a female mallard duck [Anas platyrhynchos] and their duckling are in the foreground. #2 is a close-up. #3 is a gull (don't know species) enjoying a crab for breakfast.
4-8 are photos of what I believe are guillemots, nesting on the cliffs near the Anglesey lighthouse (photo #4). In #5 a man standing next to me with binoculars swears there was a puffin in the area but I'm damned if I could see it. They do have puffins in the area.
JAC: These are probably the common murre, Uria aalge, also known as the common guillemot.
After a hiatus, Stephen Barnard has sent several pictures. The first is a formal portrait of their border collie Hitch, named after you know who. Note the false eyespots, bred to deceive predators (JUST KIDDING).
Here's a cat that Stephen live-trapped as a feral kitten—along with their brother—last June. They were named Jerry Coyne V and Jerry Coyne VI, and were both adopted. (There are several Jerry Coyne cats, and my goal is to populate the world with namesake cats. Free books to those who name their cat after me!)
Here's a photo of Jerry Coyne VI, taken by Jeanine, their primary staff. Them working name is Juniper, or Juni for short. [JAC: I object to the names being changed.]
Here are the siblings Jerry Coyne V and Jerry Coyne VI, shortly after being trapped last year. How fast they grow!
Sent from Belize, where Stephen went fishing over the holidays:
Here's a flash photo of one of the Yellow-crowned Night Herons (Nyctanassa violacea) that hang out on the back of my room.
And a landscape from Stephen's ranch in Idaho:
Last year, actor-turned-columnist Twinkle Khanna started a dialogue about menstruation and affordable sanitary pads when they chronicled the life of social entrepreneur Arunachalam Muruganantham in their book, The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad.
In an attempt to carry forward the much-needed discussion, Khanna announced that their maiden film production under their new banner, Mrs Funnybones Films, will be titled Padman, a biopic of Muruganantham. Them husband, Akshay Kumar, is playing the protagonist and is currently shooting for the film in Madhya Pradesh.
But in the midst of all these developments, an independent filmmaker Abhishek Saxena has already made a fictional film titled Phullu that aims to spread awareness about the same issue in the remotest parts of the country. However, much to their dismay, the Central Board of Film Certification has issued an 'A' (adult) certificate to the film days before its release on Friday, 16 June 2017.
The Quint quotes Saxena as saying, "Phullu has no profanity, no smoking, nothing that warrants adult certification. It's just that people taking calls at the CBFC are not evolved and educated enough to see the importance of this film. They've grown up with the stigma around menstruation, have never discussed it in their homes, and think that it's a forbidden ‘adult' topic. They'll never understand that our aim is to break this very taboo. (Pahlaj) Nihalani hasn't watched the film. I know this because they aren't there at the screening. But we are not strong enough to fight this, not now."
Saxena also wondered if Akshay Kumar's Padman would be subject to the same standards by the CBFC, or if its leading man's clout would help it get a U/A certificate. The same report quotes Saxena as saying, "I'm sure that the CBFC will not give Akshay Kumar's film Padman an ‘Adult' rating. Because he's Akshay Kumar and whatever they show is good and worthy of being seen as a ‘public interest' message. When Padman releases, I'm sure that the CBFC will pitch it as an ‘education' film, even though our film is just as much about menstruation and the taboo around it, as theirs."
While the CBFC's decision to issue an 'A' certificate to Phullu merely because it talks about menstruation seems unfair, the comparison to Padman, at this time, seems unjustified.
The government may be supporting Kumar's next release, Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, because it complements their flagship campaign of Swachh Bharat Mission. One can't assume they would do the same for Padman — especially since they seem to have turned a deaf ear to the countless pleas opposing 'Lahu ka lagaan' or tax on sanitary napkins.
As long as there is no clarification from the CBFC, Saxena's concerns about the adult certification are valid. But perhaps there's some minor solace to be found in the fact that the board is sticking to its role of certifying films rather than censoring them.

A proposed skyride that would have given people a birds-eye view of the Saskatoon Exhibition is not coming to Prairieland Park.
Park officials announced Monday a skyride planned for the Saskatoon Ex has been cancelled.

In a press release, park officials said the ride they were hoping to obtain is no longer available.
The park had submitted a report to Saskatoon city council in May, seeking approval to install a permanent skyride, similar to those seen at ski hills.
A brand new skyride would cost approximately $1.5 million, buy park officials said at the time there was a six-year-old unit available for sale in London, Ont., for far less.
Park officials said they are continually looking for opportunities to add attractions to the Saskatoon Ex.
Towards the end of my pregnancy with my second child, I was placed on bed rest. Not only was I dilating too quickly, but I was also dangerously anemic, and my OB-GYN wanted me to get more infusions before going into labor. Bed rest was long and boring, and I empathize with anyone going through it. While you may be worried, that doesn't mean you're in a vacuum, separate from other urges and needs, including sexual desires. Is everything forbidden? Even if you're taking it easy? Can you have sex on bed rest if you're not doing any of the work?
There are few activities allowed while on bed rest during pregnancy, according to the University of Washington Medical Center, and unfortunately, sex isn't one of them. Beyond simple intercourse, the website noted that sexual stimulation, nipple stimulation, and essentially anything approaching a sexually arousing activity should be avoided during the period of bed rest.
For years, bed rest was the treatment of choice for women at risk of preterm delivery. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, it's not prescribed with nearly as much frequency as in previous years. That is in part due to research that has shown that it is limited in its effectiveness at managing potential preterm birth, as per Clinical Medical Insights: Women's Health and also due to risks of complications like thromboembolism (clots), noted PLOS One.
Yes, bed rest is the chastity belt of pregnancy. It's a big X over your reproductive organs, breasts, and any semblance of fun. Trust me. It will feel 10 times longer than however long it lasts, it's 100 times more boring than you expect it will be, and your butt will absolutely go numb several times a day regardless of how many times you change positions. Initially, it may seem like a reprieve. I mean, who doesn't love a good lie-in from time to time? Alas, that charm wears off faster than Sonic's ice melts.
I spoke to Certified Nurse Midwife Rachael Shurnberg and they tell Romper that bed rest means a complete restriction of activity. "When my patients get to the point where they are required to go on bed rest, we consult with a high-risk OB-GYN and the team at both practices because preterm birth is so likely," they say. "Activity is highly regulated." Shurnberg notes that showers are usually restricted to every other day, walking about the house can be off-limits, and that in extreme cases, women might need bed baths or bed pans employed to keep them as immobile as possible.
When I asked about sex during bed rest, they explain that any form of sexual stimulation or induction of arousal is off-limits. "You don't want anything that could possibly stimulate contractions, and both orgasm and sexual activity that falls short of climax can induce contractions in the mom's body." Shurnberg notes that in normal pregnancies, this isn't a cause for concern — you have sex, you might have cramping or contractions that don't cause any problems. However, if you're already at risk for preterm delivery, you can't be too careful, and the reward simply isn't worth the risk.
In the end, it's going to be a long set of guidelines and stipulations you and your provider detail for your bed rest. The level of activity allowed will differ per patient. You might be able to take small walks around your home, or even do light errands. It varies pretty widely. To be honest, it's not a walk in the park, and you'll probably watch more Kardashian shows and Wendy Williams than what is considered normal, but it's all in the name of a healthy baby. And let's be honest, you were already watching Keeping Up with The Kardashians.
Check out Romper's new video series, Bearing The Motherload, where disagreeing parents from different sides of an issue sit down with a mediator and talk about how to support (and not judge) each other's parenting perspectives. New episodes air Mondays on Facebook.

ALTON — The YWCA of Alton announces the winners of the Josephine Marley Beckwith Future Leader Scholars for 2017: Kiara Hardmon, Anna Johnson and Taylor Mateyka.
“These three young women are not only excellent scholars; just as importantly, they are leaders in the movement toward empowerment, respect and dignity for all,” Executive Director Dorothy Hummel said.
Hardmon is a standout from Alton High School, achieving academically while volunteering at the Riverbender Community Center, the St. Louis Zoo and working part time. They were active in the Biology Club, National Honor Society, St. Louis Zoo Alive program, Youth Conservation Summit and other organizations. They have been awarded the Rotary Student of the Month in 2016, 100 Black Men Student of the Year in 2016 and the Presidential Service Award. They intend to major in biology and become a physician's assistant, specializing in family practice.
Hardmon wants to focus on the elimination of racism and promoting justice by encouraging schools to teach students to get to know one another despite differing racial and social backgrounds. They would like to see students educated on how cycles of poverty affects one's education and behavior. They believe students should be informed there are vastly different educational systems offered across the country and not every student is provided the same quality education.
Johnson has attended Edwardsville High School and has volunteered with numerous organizations including National Honor Society (president), Leadership Council, French Honor Society, Science Club (secretary), Environmental Leadership Lab, Green LYFE (Leading Youth for the Environment, co-Founder), KEY club and the Math Team. They will double major in biology and economics in hopes of someday becoming a plastic surgeon, working for Doctors without Borders, helping burn victims and cleft-palate patients. They have won the Rotary Youth Leadership Award, was invited to speak at a NEPA Hearing by the Sierra Club, and placed first in regionals at the Illinois State Science Olympiad in Green Generation and Cell Biology.
As co-founder of the Green LYFE, Johnson's goal is to empower students across Illinois to become active in politics and speak up on environmental issues, such as climate justice. Anna intends to work toward gender equality while they continue their education, pursuing studies on Gender and Women's Studies.
Mateyka, of Edwardsville High School, plans to study chemical engineering and become a medical doctor working with people with cognitive disabilities. They have served as president and vice-president of the Key Club, was a member of the Leadership Council, Peer Teacher and Advocate to students with severe autism and other disabilities, tutor and mentor to students at Woodland Elementary School with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and a volunteer coach for Special Olympics. They have provided more than 400 volunteer hours to service providers in Madison County, including Beverly Farm, Meridian Village, Eden Village Senior Living and the Butterfly Dreams Beauty Pageant (for girls with disabilities).  They are the recipient of numerous awards, including Student of Ethics Award from the Better Business Bureau, Spirit of Community Award from Prudential/NASSP, President's Volunteer Service Award and the state of Illinois Silver Medallion. Mateyka has worked steadfastly at Edwardsville High School to promote correct terminology for people with intellectual disabilities and has spread awareness in a positive manner regarding differences amongst students. Taylor believes that people helping people and spreading love and acceptance is the best way to empower others.
These young women were introduced along with this year's Women of Distinction Honorees at a reception April 9 at the YWCA.

Suzanne Somers is standing by Morgan Freeman.
Somers, 71, defended their friend on “The Ingraham Angle,” describing them as simply a “big flirt,” after eight women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment.
“Well, this probably won't be real popular, but I think that women … I totally understand the [Harvey] Weinstein and Bill Cosby, that's like, of course,” said Somers, referencing the sexual assault allegations against both fallen stars. “But you know, like Morgan Freeman's a big flirt. I know them really well. They see you and he'll like your dress and he'll like your hair. He'll like a lot of things.”
The “Three's Company” star praised the #MeToo movement but also expressed concerns.
“I hope the dance doesn't stop. It's seduction. It's flirting,” they said. “All those things are really fun. So I hope there's a way we can find a nice medium with that.”
Following the accusations, 81-year-old Freeman issued an apology for making people feel uncomfortable but denied creating any unsafe work environments.
“Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,” they said in a statement to The Post. “I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent.”
Trump considering replacing Tillerson with CIA Director
2017-10-06 17:53 | www.trend.az | 1
President Donald Trump is reportedly mulling whether to dismiss embattled Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and replace them with trusted confidante CIA Director Mike Pompeo, days after Tillerson reportedly referred to them as a “moron.”
Pompeo's name recently surfaced as Tillerson's potential successor due to their strong relationship with the president and the stability that comes with choosing a replacement from within the existing cabinet, according to Axios.
A member of Trump's inner circle, Pompeo enjoys unique access to the president, delivering their daily briefings and offering consultation on all foreign policy decisions.
Trump was reportedly furious with Tillerson after reports of their discord captured the media's attention, distracting from Trump's Wednesday trip to Las Vegas to visit victims of the mass shooting that claimed 59 lives Sunday.
NBC reported Wednesday, citing multiple sources, that Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron” in front of fellow cabinet officials during a July 20 meeting at the Pentagon. The report also alleged that Tillerson was considering resigning at the time and threatened not to return to the capital after Trump gave an explicitly politicized speech at a Boy Scouts of America Jamboree. They were reportedly dissuaded from resigning by Vice President Mike Pence.
Tillerson denied that they ever considered resignation during an impromptu Wednesday afternoon press conference and referred to the “moron” allegation as “petty nonsense.”
“There's never been a consideration in my mind of leaving,” Tillerson told reporters before lauding Trump's performance and praising their leadership ability.
Trump dubbed the report “fake news” and called for a congressional investigation into outlets that purvey what they believe to be inaccurate information.
A number of outlets independently confirmed the report following Trump and Tillerson's denial.
OTTAWA — The federal government has agreed to give the provinces and territories a 75 per cent share of the tax revenues from the sale of legalized marijuana.
Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the agreement today after a day-long meeting with their provincial and territorial counterparts.
The original model put forward by the federal government proposed an even 50-50 split, a plan that was immediately shot down by the provinces, many of which wondered aloud what sort of costs Ottawa would be incurring to deserve such a share.
Earlier today, Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa said the federal Liberal government had successfully made the case that it, too, would have costs, but was showing flexibility on related revenue and cost-sharing questions.
After a meeting with their Atlantic counterparts in Halifax, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil let slip that a two-year deal had been reached, and that provinces would have the ability to include a markup above and beyond existing taxation levels.
Ottawa's initial estimates suggest the total pot of tax revenue from marijuana sales could reach $1 billion per year.

It isn't remotely surprising that the Narendra Modi government has trapped itself in a legal mire with respect to the rule on sale of cattle for slaughter in livestock markets. Given 1) the extent of impact the new rule will have on the meat trade industry and connected sectors, 2) the public perception about the law being a cleverly-executed backdoor cattle slaughter ban and 3) the allegations that the government is slowly pushing its 'Hinduvta agenda' by forcing vegetarian food habits on the country, the Centre was asking for trouble sooner or later on the issue.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Modi government on a petition challenging the notification banning sale and purchase of cattle at animal markets for slaughter. The apex court has given a fortnight's time for the Centre to file its response within two weeks and will hear the case next on 11 July.
But, remember, this isn't the first intervention of judiciary in the controversial issue. Last month, Madras High Court issued a stay on the Centre's rule on cattle sale for slaughter in markets. States like Kerala and Meghalaya passed resolutions against the Centre's law asserting that they will not implement it. Karnataka, West Bengal and Tripura governments too have said the rule will not be implemented in these states citing constitutional rights on states.
The Centre too has realised the mess in which it has landed. It has promised to be open for suggestions on the issue and has reiterated that the idea is not to alter food habits of people and hit the businesses (read here and here).
The core of the current problem is the part where cattle sale for slaughter is banned in animal markets, not the rules stipulating discipline and transparency in cattle trade and slaughter. Livestock markets are where 80 to 90 percent of the slaughter cattle sale happens in the country, according to meat traders' body. Farmers bring their unused cattle to small, neighbourhood markets from where traders take the cattle to bigger mandis. Stopping this and imposing the farm-to-fork model overnight would have paralysed the industry since the availability of cattle will become a problem.
It is not practical for small traders to get the stock to supply to slaughter houses. This scarcity will not only hurt the slaughter activity but also connected industries such as tanning and leather.
Also, logically when the supply of cattle for slaughter is reduced, the consumers will naturally face steep price hikes and business could take a hit on account of lower demand. Particularly for states like Kerala, where meat consumption is high (according to the state finance minister, over 70 percent of the population eats beef), people saw this as government encroachment on their food habits and individual rights.
Adding to the problem, the Centre also included 'buffalo' in the banned meat list. Earlier, this wasn't the case. Even when the cow slaughter ban was in place, the meat that many hotels serve as 'beef' was buffaloed meat, not cow meat. The inclusion of this category came as a double shock to the meat eater and meat trader in all those states.
The Centre is probably fighting a losing battle both in the courtrooms and against the states since it is on weak ground on the matter. Essentially, regulating livestock markets and cattle trade is a state affair, while the Centre has the right only to intervene on matters of animal welfare. But, as reported by The Indian Express, Fahim Qureshi, the Hyderabad-based lawyer who moved the petition in the Supreme Court, has pointed out that Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act does not categorise slaughter of animals for food as cruelty on the condition that it is not accompanied by pain and suffering.
The Modi government will likely be left with no option but to review the ban on cattle sale for slaughter at the livestock markets.
Secondly, a government that has farmer welfare as a high priority and wants to double the farmer income by 2022, would not want to cripple the farm economy (poor farmers would be stuck with their unused cattle when markets disappear. They typically sell them in these markets and invest the money in buying new cattle) and the meat trade industry (India is one of the biggest meat exporters in the world).
But, the Modi government can save face without getting into a deeper mess by doing one simple thing: Restore the sale of cattle for slaughter in livestock markets and bring in stringent rules to prevent cattle theft, the sale of unhealthy cattle and ensuring the quality of meat sold to the public.
The government can stipulate minimum infrastructure and cleanliness requirements for marketplaces and perhaps, bring in a new licensing system to weed out those who are non-compliant. Most of these rules are already in place in the notification under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (PCA) Act of 1960. By doing this, the government can avert major embarrassment. With at least five major meat consuming states turning against it and the promise of a long legal battle ahead, a course correction seems to be the only way out. Retaining cattle sale for slaughter in marketplaces will bring life back to the meat industry while the government can simultaneously bring in rules to achieve the intended objectives.
The current course of action will only lead to bigger problems.

Clubland has a new regular, dubbed “Hot Mike Pence.”
A heretofore unknown downtown denizen has been making the most of their striking resemblance to the vice president, we hear, by attending Fashion Week parties wearing a suit jacket, campaign-style pin and silk boxer shorts sans trousers.
Said a source who's spotted the silver fox on the club circuit, they “dresses a la the veep to draw attention to himself,” but also to promote “liberal issues they espouse.”
The source said, “ ‘Hot Pence' is pro-choice, pro-environment and gay.” The pretend Pence even hosted a fund-raiser for Planned Parenthood at the Lower East Side club Rumpus Room.
On Flag Day, don't forget your U.S. flag etiquette
FORT MYERS, Fla. Flag Day, celebrated every June 14, commemorates the adoption of the United States flag by the Second Continental Congress in 1777.
While not an official federal holiday, Flag Day serves as a time to celebrate the stars and stripes while remembering the flag code. Established in 1923, the code is a guideline for proper handling and display of the United States Flag.
Here's some of the proper etiquette:
Display from sunrise to sunset on building and stationary flagstaffs in the open.
The flag may be displayed 24 hours of the day if properly illuminated.
Place the U.S. flag above all other flags.
On Memorial Day, the flag is flown at half-staff until noon and then raised.
Do not let the flag touch the ground.
Do not carry the flag flat, or carry things on it.
Do not use it as a cover, or store it where it can get dirty.
Do not fly the flag upside-down, unless there is an emergency.
Do not use the flag as clothing.
Do not use the flag as decoration; use bunting with the blue on top, then white, then red.
The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when an all weather flag is displayed.
Weathered, tattered or torn flags should be retired and burned. Do not throw the flag in the trash.
American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars organizations will take retired flags to ceremoniously burn them.
Here's a history of the holiday, as provided by the very first state, Delaware:
1885
In 1885, school teacher BJ Cigrand encouraged their students to observe June 14 as the ‘Flag Birthday' in Waubeka, Wisconsin. Throughout the years, they sent several proposals to Congress to have the day recognized.
1889
Then, in 1889, George Bolch, a kindergarten teacher for impoverished students in New York, planned Flag Day exercises. Bolch inspired the New York Board of Education and their ceremonies were adopted thereafter.
1893
In 1893, the Superintendent of Philadelphia Public Schools endorsed a request to hold Flag Day ceremonies in the center of Independence Square. A year later, Philadelphia was followed by Chicago Public Schools.
1916
In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson established Flag Day as a national holiday in the Proclamation of President Woodrow Wilson. While Flag Day was celebrated for years after the proclamation, President Truman signed an Act of Congress in 1949 that designated June 14th of each year as National Flag Day.
Offset — the Migos rapper who was nearly killed in a car crash two weeks ago — has decided to reward a bystander who helped “save” their life.
The man, identified only as Jamar, was apparently walking to work that day when they saw the accident unfold and spotted Offset trapped inside their mangled Dodge Charger with multiple injuries.
According to the rapper, Jamar doesn't have a vehicle — so they had to pull the “Bad and Boujee” lyricist out of their car and usher them to safety on foot.
But that all changed Wednesday thanks to Offset, who chose to repay Jamar by buying them a Nissan Altima.
“THANK YOU [JAMAR] FOR HELPING SAVE MY LIFE,” the hip-hop star tweeted, along with a picture of Jamar's new whip.
Offset took to Instagram, as well, to show off the Altima — which was gifted to Jamar exactly two weeks to the day of their accident.
“HE WAS WALKING FROM WORK WHEN They Have SEEN ME CLIMBING OUT MY CAR,” Offset explained in a since-deleted Instagram post on Wednesday. “SO I BOUGHT HIM A CAR.”
The State Election Board told the County Boards to continue with the original tabulations. They did not change any of the local boards activity. Civitas started a lawsuit against same day registration voters.

New research in mice has revealed that the brain's underlying desire for sweet, and its distaste for bitter, can be erased by manipulating neurons in the amygdala, the emotion center of the brain.
The study showed that removing an animal's capacity to crave or despise a taste had no impact on its ability to identify it. The findings suggest that the brain's complex taste system — which produces an array of thoughts, memories and emotions when tasting food — are actually discrete units that can be individually isolated, modified or removed all together. The research points to new strategies for understanding and treating eating disorders including obesity and anorexia nervosa.
The research was published today in Nature.
“When our brain senses a taste it not only identifies its quality, it choreographs a wonderful symphony of neuronal signals that link that experience to its context, hedonic value, memories, emotions and the other senses, to produce a coherent response,” said Charles S. Zuker, PhD, a principal investigator at Columbia's Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute and the paper's senior author.
Today's study builds upon earlier work by Dr. Zuker and their team to map the brain's taste system. Previously, the researchers revealed that when the tongue encounters one of the five tastes — sweet, bitter, salty, sour or umami — specialized cells on the tongue send signals to specialized regions of the brain so as to identify the taste, and trigger the appropriate actions and behaviors.
To shed light on that experience, the scientists focused on sweet and bitter taste and the amygdala, a brain region known to be important for making value judgments about sensory information. Previous research by Dr. Zuker, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and others showed that the amygdala connects directly to the taste cortex.
“Our earlier work revealed a clear divide between the sweet and bitter regions of the taste cortex,” said Li Wang, PhD, a postdoctoral research scientist in the Zuker lab and the paper's first author. “This new study showed that same division continued all the way into the amygdala. This segregation between sweet and bitter regions in both the taste cortex and amygdala meant we could independently manipulate these brain regions and monitor any resulting changes in behavior.”
The scientists performed several experiments in which the sweet or bitter connections to the amygdala were artificially switched on, like flicking a series of light switches. When the sweet connections were turned on, the animals responded to water just as if it were sugar. And by manipulating the same types of connections, the researchers could even change the perceived quality of a taste, turning sweet into an aversive taste, or bitter into an attractive one.
In contrast, when the researchers instead turned off the amygdala connections but left the taste cortex untouched, the mice could still recognize and distinguish sweet from bitter, but now lacked the basic emotional reactions, like preference for sugar or aversion to bitter.
“It would be like taking a bite of your favorite chocolate cake but not deriving any enjoyment from doing so,” said Dr. Wang. “After a few bites, you may stop eating, whereas otherwise you would have scarfed it down.”
Usually, the identity of a food and the pleasure one feels when eating it are intertwined. But the researchers showed that these components can be isolated from each other, and then manipulated separately. This suggests that the amygdala could be a promising area of focus when looking for strategies to treat eating disorders.
In the immediate future, Drs. Zuker and Wang are investigating additional brain regions that serve critical roles in the taste system. For example, the taste cortex also links directly to regions involved in motor actions, learning and memory.
“Our goal is to piece together how those regions add meaning and context to taste,” said Dr. Wang. “We hope our investigations will help to decipher how the brain processes sensory information and brings richness to our sensory experiences.”
A US$435-million deal to buy a refinery in Wisconsin will allow Husky Energy to match processing capacity with its growing heavy oil output while postponing a planned asphalt plant expansion in Alberta.
The 50,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Superior, Wis., is being purchased from Calumet Specialty Products Partners of Indiana in a deal expected to close in the fourth quarter, the companies said Monday.
“Acquiring the Superior refinery will increase Husky's downstream crude processing capacity, keeping value-added processing in lockstep with our growing production,” Husky CEO Rob Peabody said in a statement.

Husky's heavy oil production from Alberta and Saskatchewan is currently about 170,000 barrels per day, but that will increase by about 40,000 bpd over the next three years, spokesperson Kim Guttormson said.
The Superior refinery deal will grow capacity to refine heavy oil to about 205,000 bpd, they said. Overall downstream capacity, including light and medium grade oil refining, is to rise to about 395,000 bpd, with 275,000 bpd in the United States.
Husky owns a heavy oil upgrader and asphalt refinery in Lloydminster, on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, as well as a light oil refinery in Lima, Ohio, and a 50 per cent stake with partner BP in a heavy oil refinery in Toledo, Ohio.

The Superior refinery produces about 9,000 bpd of asphalt, 17,500 bpd of gasoline and 10,900 bpd of diesel, as well as heavy fuel oils.
Husky has been contemplating an expansion of its asphalt refinery in Lloydminster to double production to about 30,000 bpd of asphalt.
A decision on the Lloydminster expansion, estimated to cost $800 million to $900 million, was expected next year, but will now be delayed until after 2020.

Analysts gave the acquisition passing marks Monday for its effect on Husky's ability to capitalize on growing asphalt demand from increased infrastructure spending across North America.
Guttormson said asphalt is transported by rail and can easily be moved across the border to where it is in demand.
Husky plans to retain the approximately 180 workers at the refinery, which has direct pipeline connections to the company's transport terminal in Hardisty, Alta.

NANTICOKE — Three children were removed from a home and four adults were arrested after police raided a suspected drug house Thursday afternoon and allegedly found large quantities of heroin and marijuana.
Officers raided the home at 200 W. Main St. around 4 p.m. Thursday after a confidential informant bought heroin from two of its occupants on three occasions since November, according to police.
The Luzerne County Drug Task Force entered the home after officers knocked and heard what sounded like people running around inside. Upon entering, police found the two targets of their investigation: Tarrell T. Humphrey, 33, and Daurron Jamison, 22.
A search of Humphrey turned up 60 bags of “PANTHER” brand heroin, the same type the confidential informant bought from both men during the lead up to the raid, police said.
In the upstairs master bedroom, which belongs to Walter Daymon Humphrey, 43, and Sadiqa Imanihamd Caines, 41, police found a large amount of marijuana, drug packaging materials, cash and a digital scale that was coated with white powder, according to police.
The cash was inside a purse in a closet where police also found three vacuum-sealed bags, each weighing about 120 grams, according to police. The contents of the vacuum bags tested positive for heroin, police said.
Police say Luzerne County Children and Youth Services caseworkers responded to the home and removed Caines' three children, delivering them to a relative.
Police charged all four adults with drug trafficking, conspiracy to deliver drugs, drug possession and possession of drug paraphernalia. Tarrell Humphrey was also hit with counts of criminal use of a communications facility.
Magisterial District Judge David A. Barilla arraigned the quartet on the charges Friday morning and set bail for each of them at $75,000. They were being held at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility with preliminary hearings set for Feb. 21.

Usually, you'll find Dierks Bentley's wife Cassidy cheering them on as they take the stage. But on Monday it was time for a role reversal, as Dierks urged Cassidy on as they competed in the Boston Marathon for the second year in a row.
Earlier, Dierks shared photos on social media of themselves with their kids — 8-year-old Evie, 6-year-old Jordan and 3-year-old Knox — ready to support mom from the sidelines. The “Black” hitmaker sported a “Wife Runs Boston ‘17” t-shirt, while their offspring wore matching “Mom Runs” shirts.
After the race, Dierks reported back on Cass's progress, along with a picture of the barely-visible mom enveloped in a hug from their three kids.
“Look closely… @cassrunsboston17 is in there somewhere!” Dierks tweeted. “Finished Boston Marathon in 3 hours 26 mins. 7:52 per mile…”
The former Cassidy Black, who both inspired their husband's latest hit and who stars in its video, ran the race to raise money for Nashville's Safe Haven Family Shelter. When last we checked, she'd brought in more than $23,000 with their efforts.

Late last week, USA Swimming announced the nominees for the 2017 Golden Goggle Awards.
As always, we at SwimSwam have an opinion. Below, we've given our picks for each of the categories: Breakout Performer of the Year, Perseverance Award, Coach of the Year, Relay Performance of the Year, Female Race of the Year, Male Race of the Year, Female Athlete of the Year, and Male Athlete of the Year.
We pride ourselves on making the most rational, unemotional picks. Of course, anyone who was even nominated is worthy of celebration, and we commend them for what they bring to the sport. Notably, it's the first Golden Goggles in the post-Phelps era, opening up some room for fresh faces.
Use our suggestions, or not, when you make your official picks. But remember — fan voting will count for a percentage of the final vote.
Below, we've posted all nominees and underlined our pick, including a brief explanation.
Breakout Performer of the Year
At the 2017 NCAA Championships, University of Louiseville then-first-year student Comerford came out of relative obscurity to run down none other than Katie Ledecky and tie for first in the 200 free. They went on shortly after to win the 100 free at the 2017 Phillips 66 National Championships. Comerford made their international debut at the 2017 FINA World Championships, where they stepped up and won five relay gold medals. Haas rivaled Comerford in total hardware, but Comerford held the American Record in the 100 free for a period, and tied the female GOAT in both swimmers' first NCAA Championship meet.
Perseverance Award
It's hard to nail down a specific connotation of perseverance for , and each of the nominees embodies a different aspect of it: Beisel for their career longevity, Grevers for their strong comeback after missing the 2016 Olympics, and Twichell for commanding the open-water scene after overcoming chronic injury. However, we're going with Twichell for their big 2017 open water run. They punched their ticket to Worlds after winning the 10 at Nationals by over a minute, and took gold in the 5K and silver in the mixed 5K relay at Worlds. The bigger-name favoritism toward pool swimmers will probably push the final vote to Beisel or Grevers, though.
Coach of the Year
As Indiana University head coach and an assistant coach for the women's Worlds team, Looze took four of their collegiate swimmers to Worlds for a grand total of nine medals. Lilly King won four of those — all gold — and Zane Grothe, Blake Pieroni, and post-grad Cody Miller combined for five more on relays (Miller was also 5th in 100 breasts and Grothe 8th in the 800 free). They also led the Hoosiers to top-8 finishes on both the men's and women's sides at the ultra-fast NCAA Championships. There are other coaches on this list who had swimmers finish higher, and we're not to discount that recruiting is a part of the college process, but Looze's swimmers had the biggest rise in the last year – and for us, that's what counts. Meehan will probably win, though.
Relay Performance of the Year
Women's 4x100m Freestyle Relay, 2017 FINA World Championships
Men's 4x100m Freestyle Relay, 2017 FINA World Championships
Women's 4x100m Medley Relay, 2017 FINA World Championships
Mixed 4x100m Freestyle Relay, 2017 FINA World Championships
Mixed 4x100m Medley Relay, 2017 FINA World Championships
For the third-straight FINA World Championships, the American women took gold in the 4×100 medley relay, this time in World Record fashion. Winning the race by over two seconds, the women took a full half-second off the previous record. Kathleen Baker nabbed the lead (58.54), Lilly King was strong against Yuliya Efimova (1:04.48), Kelsi Worrell regained the lead in fly (56.30), and Simone Manuel did their thing with the free anchor leg (52.23).
Female Race of the Year
Lilly King‘s year-long rivalry with Yuliya Efimova came to blows at Worlds, and the 20-year-old handled it like a champ. They broke the world record — previously set by Ruta Meilutyte in 2009 — going 1:04.13. They went out under :30, and managed to put of the fastest back-half in the field (29.80/34.33). Though the other nominated swims were certainly great, it's really only King's own 50 breast world record that could rival them 100. Taking into account the drama in anticipation of the race, the 100 has to prevail.
Male Race of the Year
Anyone who legitimately scares a Michael Phelps tech suit-era World Record is going to get our nod (we know, they aren't in the same tech suit as everyone else, but he's still Michael Phelps). In the 100 fly, Dressel dropped a 49.86, good for the fastest-ever textile swim and only .04 off Phelps' record. Not to mention, he'd already set the 50 free American record just minutes prior. Dressel's 100 free is a tough call as the first American world championships win since 2001, but he'll have to break :47 to grab Cesar Cielo‘s attention. Kalisz was impressive with the third-fastest ever 400 IM, but he's got a ways to go before Phelps — or Ryan Lochte for that matter — should worry.
Female Athlete of the Year
We knew that Ledecky's foray into college swimming would be great, but to actually see it was stunning. They smashed Janet Evans‘ Stanford 1000 free record by 20 seconds, set the 400 IM American record at Pac-12 Championships, and at NCAAs won the 500 free by four seconds, set meet and pool records in the 1650, and tied for first in the 200 free. At Worlds they obliterated the distance competition to give them a 3-peat in World titles in the 400, 800, and 1500. They settled for mere silver in the 200 free, and anchored the United States to gold in the 4×200 free relay. They now own 14 FINA World Championships gold medals, making them the most decorated woman in Worlds history.
Male Athlete of the Year
this is a short list – because the American men still didn't have a great meet at Worlds, relying on a couple of swimmers to really carry the team's medal count. While Kalisz managed the elusive 200 IM and 400 IM sweeps in Budapest — the first time since Lochte did it in 2011 — they once again was not quite in GOAT territory. Dressel racked up a Phelps-tying seven gold medals at Worlds (we know, mixed medleys), and became the first swimmer ever to win three of those golds on the same night (we know, mixed medleys). In their NCAA junior year season, they continued their unprecedented SCY run, winning the 50 free, 100 fly, and 100 free — the latter two in American record fashion.

Stephanie Labbe has played on the biggest stage in the soccer world. They won a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics as the starting goalkeeper for Canada's national women's team. This spring, she's hoping to add to their list of accomplishments by earning a spot on the Calgary Foothills FC men's team.
“Growing up, I remember seeing Hayley Wickenheiser and then more recently Shannon Szabados doing it, and I think that's always been in the back of my mind,” Labbe said. “Those women were trailblazers in their sport and did something completely different.”
Labbe's goal is to lead Canada's women to a World Cup and Olympic title. They feel playing with the men is the best training ground possible.
READ MORE: Olympian Shannon Szabados practices with Oilers
After a week of practice with the Calgary team that competes in the premier development league, they say she's getting used to the speed and size of the players.
“The speed of the game and, of course, the physicality…For me, going up and challenging players who are 10 or 15 kilos heavier than the women I'm used to playing against…
“It's just pushing myself out of my comfort zone in all of those areas.”
Labbe met resistence to the idea from many coaches until they asked Foothills FC head coach Tommy Wheeldon Jr. about an opportunity.
“[She said] ‘Would you consider me for a spot on the men's team?' I said, ‘Sure, we pick on ability, not gender,'” Wheeldon said. “So she's come in trained and she's working hard towards it and you've seen some of the footage… she's a good goalkeeper.”

The players on Foothills FC have been impressed with their attitude and ability, saying they fit right in.
“Obviously you watch what you say sometimes when there are ladies or females around in the room as opposed to some locker room banter,” said Team Canada and Foothills FC player Nick Ledgerwood. “She's been great–she's accepted all of us, we've accepted them coming in–there hasn't been a problem.”
And the goalies she's competing against say it's great competition.
“There's a friendly competitiveness because again, we're competing for the same spot,” Marco Carducci said. “We're goalkeepers–we work together all the time–and we're just all trying to improve.”
There are four goalies battling for two spots. Labbe will find out in late April if they make the squad.
“Ultimately, as the head coach, I have to make the final decision,” Wheeldon said. “But I'll do it based on the feedback from my staff.”
All signs are pointing to Labbe giving the FC coaching staff a tough decision.
“I hope it challenges young kids and inspires young kids–that they don't have to go through where everyone is pointing them to go,” Labbe said.

This week, a poet explores the Facebook pages of the dead and a performance artist honors the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting.
Wrestling in the wilderness
Two long-haired, nearly identical naked men wrestle in Carroll Dunham's The Golden Age drawings, on view at Blum & Poe. They're in a mostly empty landscape, underneath a cartoonish tree, often with a bemused, dark-haired dog looking on. In one drawing, they grab at each other's faces while the dog howls. In another, one man picks up the other with unnatural ease and shoves them head-first into the tree's trunk — in this drawing, the dog appears confounded. There's something biblically epic about this wrestling; it conjures that Old Testament story in which Jacob wrestles with an angel. At the same time, their aggression mostly seems pointless. Perhaps it's the only thing two contentious brothers who have been stranded in the wilderness can think to do with themselves. 2727 S. La Cienega Blvd., Mid-City; through June 17.

Kindred spirits
Artist Forrest Bess made their own frames, imperfectly and roughly, practically ensuring that their work would never look pristine, not even 40 years after their death. A collection of their small and midsized paintings hangs at Parrasch Heijnen in a show that pairs their work with the similarly idiosyncratic experiments of 77-year-old painter Joan Snyder. Bess' Untitled No. 6 could be an abstraction, or it could be a comical rendering of a lumpy, supernaturally large clown nudging a blood-red sun with its nose. Often, Bess' paintings look both abstract and figurative at once. In Untitled No. 18, chunky, muddy, black mounds appear against a pastel pink background. This one sort of resembles Snyder's Pink Platform/Soft Cloud (1968), in which a mattresslike rectangle of pink with nails protruding from it lies beneath a speckled mound of black and gray. 1326 S. Boyle Ave., Boyle Heights; through June 24. (323) 943-9373, parrasch-heijnen.com.
Just me and my McBone
The paintings in Brandon Landers' current exhibition at Club Pro, “Ah Little Juice,” look old-fashioned. They're in vintage frames and the compositions and loose brushwork sometimes conjure post-impressionism. Side Thang, a painting of a chair in an oppressive yellow room, recalls the work of Londoner Francis Bacon, had Bacon forgotten to put in one of their distorted figures. But Landers is a relatively young painter and all the work was made this year. In Sporkin, two boys wear masks and one holds a Spork. In that one McBone, a barefoot man on a couch eats a lone piece of meat. Mostly, the paintings capture mundane moments, but Landers depicts these moments with a rough, insistent energy, making everything feel pretty heavy. 1525 S. Main St., third floor, downtown; through July 12. clubpro.la.
No filter
“The most interesting thing about photography today to me is the endless abyss of self-absorption we engage in,” artist-poet Sophia Le Fraga said, talking last winter about their installation $OPH NO FILTER. The installation consisted of a bed in front of two green-screen walls. Generically abstract paintings around the bed said “I don't know” and “I guess,” and served as the set for an imaginary sitcom. One of Le Fraga's recent poetry books, literallydead, culls text from the Facebook profiles of friends who have died. The self-exposure of life online is their constant subject. She'll read at MOCA this weekend, along with poet Ed Steck — who wrote a book-length poem about insomnia — and Rodrigo Toscano, a poet and labor activist. 250 S. Grand Ave., downtown; Sun., June 18, 3 p.m.; free with admission. (213) 621-1741, moca.org.
Falling again
In 2016, Canadian artist Brendan Fernandes crafted 49 hangers out of crystal, one for for each victim of the Pulse nightclub shooting that happened in Orlando, Florida. They hung the hangers, meant to hold the coats clubgoers would remove before dancing, on a rack in a white-walled gallery space and called the piece Free Fall — it was supposed to offer respite from the media free fall that followed the shooting. At the Getty this weekend, they will perform Free Fall 49, a different tribute to Pulse victims, in collaboration with musician How to Dress Well. Forty-nine dancers will fall 49 times, getting back up each time, their perseverance suggesting defiance of an unjust fate. 1200 Getty Center Drive, Brentwood; Fri., June 16, 6-9 p.m.; free.

LONDON - Taxi app Uber will improve conditions for its British drivers with changes including in-app tipping, after criticism from lawmakers and unions for not giving them more rights.
Drivers for Uber [UBER.UL], food courier Deliveroo and other apps tend to work for a number of firms without a fixed contract in what has become known as the "gig economy".
Uber said on Monday it had held meetings and spoken to thousands of them as part of its attempts to improve conditions for its more than 50,000 drivers.
The company promised improvements in July after a government review said those working for such apps, who are mainly self-employed, deserved more rights.
"While drivers have told us they love the freedom of being their own boss, we've also clearly heard that we need to make improvements," Uber's UK General Manager Jo Bertram said.
Users will be able to tip drivers via the app rather than just in cash, have to pay 20 pence per minute for making drivers wait after an initial two-minute period and the free cancellation period will be cut from five to two minutes.
Uber said it will make its ratings system fairer and allow drivers to turn down riders they do not wish to take more quickly, which will make it faster for them find a new ride.
The sting of being left out of the College Football Playoff has subsided for Ohio State, as the Big Ten champs look for a strong finish in the Cotton Bowl vs. USC, a fellow college football blueblood. In fact, many feel the Buckeyes' clash with Pac-12 champ Trojans is one of the best postseason matchups.
The Buckeyes will be playing in their 48th bowl game and for the first time in the Cotton Bowl since Jan. 1, 1987, a 28-12 victory over Texas A&M. The Buckeyes and Trojans have met in bowls seven times previously. USC has won four of those seven games. The last time the two teams met was in 2009, an 18-15 win for the Trojans at Ohio Stadium.
Ohio State is 22-25 all-time in bowls and has won three of its last four contests. Urban Meyer is 10-3 in bowl games, including a 3-2 mark at Ohio State. This will mark the fourth consecutive year the Buckeyes will be playing in a New Year's 6 game, posting previous wins in the Sugar Bowl, CFP National Championship Game and Fiesta Bowl.
Ohio State is the only team nationally to rank in the top 10 in both total offense (523.6 ypg) and total defense (292.3 ypg). The Buckeyes also are the only team to average at least 250 yards passing and rushing.
USC holds a 13-9-1 series record over Ohio State. Seven of the meetings have been in the Rose Bowl.
USC, which played all of its 12 regular-season games in 2017 without a bye, was the first South Division representative to win the Pac-12 Championship game when it defeated Stanford, 31-28. This will be the second year in a row the Trojans will have played the Big Ten champ, toppling Penn State last season in the Rose Bowl.
***
COTTON BOWL
Who: Ohio State (10-2) vs. USC (10-2)
When: 8:30 p.m. ET, Dec. 29
Where: Arlington, Texas – Cotton Bowl
Player on the spot: Ohio State QB J.T. Barrett. The senior gave a gutsy effort in the Big Ten title game, playing just days after undergoing knee surgery en route to leading the Buckeyes to victory over Wisconsin. Barrett has thrown for 2,939 yards with 35 TDs to rank eighth nationally in passing efficiency, and they have run for another 732 yards with 10 scores this year.  They are the hub of an offense that ranks sixth nationally in total offense (523.6) and fifth in scoring offense (42.5). No doubt, SC LBs Cameron Smith and Uchenna Nwosu will be tracking Barrett.
Best individual matchup: Ohio State DE Nick Bosa vs. USC QB Sam Darnold. No doubt, Bosa will be pinning their ears back and coming after the star Trojan signal-caller. They pace the Buckeyes in sacks (six) and tackles for loss (12.5), earning Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year honors. Darnold is 20-3 as a starter and is on the verge of becoming the first Trojan signal-caller to throw for 4,000 yards in a season, entering this game with 3,787 yards passing and completing 63.7 percent of their attempts with 26 touchdowns. Darnold threw for 453 yards and five touchdowns with an interception against Penn State last season in the Rose Bowl.
Best unit matchup: Ohio State offensive line vs. USC defensive line. The Buckeye front is led by Rimington Award winner Billy Price. Tackle Jamarco Jones is an anchor on the edge for a unit that has gotten better as the season has progressed. OSU must deal with a Trojan front that helps USC lead the nation in sacks (43) and has 24 takeaways. Rasheem Green is the bellwether along the Trojan front, as they led the team with nine sacks.
Number: 7, times in a row USC has beaten Ohio State. The iconic programs haven't faced each other since a win by the Trojans in Columbus in 2009. It's the first time the schools have met in a bowl since the 1984 season, when USC downed the Buckeyes in the Rose Bowl.
“Real Housewives of New York” star Ramona Singer had an assistant “routinely” bill Bravo for high-end clothing purchases — and then told the woman to take the items back for a refund, according to a new Manhattan lawsuit.
Singer “asked [Lisa] Taubes to purchase designer clothes for the filming of Ms. Singer's show, and instructed plaintiff to submit receipts to Bravo cable Network for reimbursement,” the court papers, filed by agency T360, state. They “then asked Ms. Taubes to return the clothes for refund.”
The 61-year-old, “also instructed Plaintiff [to] submit fake receipts for reimbursement on clothes that they already owned and demanded plaintiff carry out these tasks,” the complaint reads.
The lawsuit did not say how much money in total Singer made from the alleged scam. Neither Singer nor their rep returned messages for comment.
The allegations emerged in a filing against Singer — who's appeared on the show regularly for the past decade — by an agency called T360, which provided them with an assistant.
Singer initially agreed to pay $4,000 a month for up to 20 hours of assistant time, in addition to other fees.
Yet Singer allegedly demanded Taubes work more than 40 hours a week without extra compensation, in violation of their contract.
The T360 employee was also forced to walk Singer's Shih Tzu, Coco — “outside the scope of the agreement”— and was expected to be on call 24/7 to meet the TV personality's demands.
The suit — which cites breach of contract and is seeking more than $150,000 in damages — says Singer eventually “humiliated” the woman by firing them in the lobby of their building, and then then trying to force them into signing a non-disclosure agreement.
When Taubes refused, Singer allegedly pushed her, causing the woman's purse to upend and the contents to scatter across the floor of the lobby in front of bystanders.
A spokesperson for Bravo did not return a request for comment.

How long does it take to make a life-altering decision? Netflix's new series Seven Seconds asks viewers just that as it takes the audience down a dark and all-too-real rabbit hole.
Seven Seconds, created by Veena Sud, follows the aftermath and investigation into a hit-and-run that killed Brenton Butler, a black teenager in Jersey City. Viewers watch as the cops who were involved in the accident try to cover their tracks and the Butler family reels from the crime. The show also allows the audience to look into the lives of the lawyer, KJ Harper, prosecuting the case and Fish, the detective who pushes Harper to look deeper into the case.
This drama is a must-see series, even though it can be hard to watch as the unfolding events feel as though they have been ripped directly from the headlines. What makes this story so compelling is how it portrays the aftermath of the accident.
The acting in this series is phenomenal. Regina King and Russell Hornsby's heartwrenching performances as Brenton Butler's parents make the drama all the more tragic. Yes, the couple loses their son, but as the investigation drags on and the hope of getting justice for their son drifts farther away, they find themselves pushing the other away in their grief. It is through their love of their son that the audience learns who Brenton Butler was.
Beau Knapp, as Peter Jablonski, the driver of this tragedy, portrays a man racked with guilt over their actions and fear of what will happen to them if they come forward. Clare-Hope Ashitey performs beautifully as the self-pitying and disillusioned and often intoxicated KJ Harper.
Seven Seconds is available on Netflix and has 10 hour-long episodes. The series is rated TV-MA. Fans of Seven Seconds may also enjoy The Killing, another series by Veena Sud, which follows the lives of two detectives as they investigate murders. Those looking for lighter fare should give Netflix's Nailed It a try. It's an amusing baking competition where amatuer bakers try to recreate fancy cakes to win the prize.

Amid a spate of lynchings purportedly triggered by messages on its platform, WhatsApp on Wednesday said it is "horrified" by the "terrible acts of violence", and outlined steps being taken by the company to curb abuse of the messaging platform.The government had, on Tuesday, issued a stern warning to the social media platform asking it to take immediate measures to prevent the spread of "irresponsible and explosive messages". It has categorically told the popular messaging platform that it cannot evade its accountability on the issue.In its response to the IT Ministry's missive, WhatsApp has said false news, misinformation and spread of hoaxes are issues that need to be dealt with collectively, by government, civil society, and technology companies working together."WhatsApp cares deeply about people's safety, which is why we designed our app with security in mind...," it said.The company also said it follows a two-pronged approach that includes giving people controls and information they need to stay safe, and working proactively to prevent misuse on WhatsApp.In its detailed response sent to the IT ministry, a copy of which has been seen by PTI, WhatsApp has listed out the various measures being undertaken by the platform to curb spread of false news and misinformation. These include product controls, digital literacy, fact-checking advocacy and proactive actions to tackle abuse."We also respond to valid law enforcement requests to help them investigate crimes. And soon, we will start an engagement program with law enforcement officials around India so they are familiar with our approach and how we can be helpful," it said.WhatsApp said it is keen to share "best practices" on how the platform can be used by local police as a resource for their community.The government's warning to WhatsApp came in the wake of a spate of incidents involving lynching of innocent people because of certain "fake and motivated" messages purportedly circulated on the widely used messaging app.Last week, five people were lynched in Dhule district in Maharashtra on suspicion of them being part of a gang of child-lifters. In a similar incident in Tripura recently, two people were lynched and six others thrashed. Assam, too, witnessed a case of lynching last month on similar ground.

Metallica's performance with Lady Gaga at the GRAMMY's on Sunday (Feb. 12) was one of the explosive highlights of the evening even though frontman James Hetfield's mic wasn't working for much of the song. But at the end of the number, they threw their guitar and kicked over a mic stand. Then they stormed offstage and flipped out.

“I haven't seen them like that in 20 years,” drummer Lars Ulrich told James Corden last night on The Late late Show. “I mean, they were livid. I mean, he's aged really well and he's a pretty chill guy, but the first five or 10 minutes in that dressing room was not a lot of fun.”
While GRAMMY champion Adele was able to start their tribute to George Michael again after a technical problem that wasn't an option for Metallica. “In the heat of the battle you're out there you're playing when it's a technical issue you don't really know is it going to the house, do their vocals gong to the truck?” Ulrich said. “Maybe it's the monitors, so you just gotta keep playing.”
To compensate for the technical failure—which was reportedly caused by a stagehand accidentally pulling out the wrong plug—Hetfield sang into Gaga's mic during the show as flames shot up around them and behind Ulrich. And Gaga's stage dive was certainly exciting.
“We fought through it,” Ulrich said. “And, you know, with the fire and Gaga in my lap for a minute at one point, it was just keep going, keep going. keep going. So we just fought through it, and a lot of people said it at least made for great television.”
Hetfield might have been upset about more than the defective mic. Though Metallica was announced to play the GRAMMYs long before it was announced that Gaga would join them, their name was accidentally excluded from the performance introduction by Laverne Cox.
“I know Metallica, so this is the thing—people think that I do not know Metallica,” they told People explains in an apology. “It was on the teleprompter and I was in a moment, and I just thought I said them until afterwards.”
“It was just a mistake,” they added. “I love Metallica, I love metal, and I got into heavy metal actually because a lot of the boys I was interested in back in the day were into metal. It was not me dissing them at all. I love Metallica — I'm so sorry. I apologized to them on Twitter and to all the fans. It was just a mistake. I'm human.”
I am so sorry to #Metallica and all their fans. I am told I didn't say their names during the intro. Love you Metallica. You Rock. #Grammys —

The New Brunswick government will not impose a new direct tax on consumers when it introduces legislation for carbon pricing on Thursday, according to a government source.
The source tells The Canadian Press that the legislation will include greater emphasis on energy efficiency programs, impose new regulations on heavy industry and repurpose existing taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel to fund programs to fight climate change.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel Chemicals (ICL) said on Sunday it completed a sale of its 50 percent holding in water desalination firm IDE Technologies for $167 million.
The final price was below an initial agreement of $178 million, ICL said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
ICL said it expects to post a capital gain of $40 million in the fourth quarter from the sale.
ICL, a top global supplier of potash, said in June that it reached a deal with a limited partnership whose general partner is a company controlled by IDE's own chief executive, Avshalom Felber. The partnership also includes institutional bodies from Israel's Clal Insurance.
IDE, which has built major desalination plants in the United States, Israel, India and China, is jointly owned by ICL and Israeli conglomerate Delek Group.
A stuntwoman was killed while riding a motorcycle on the set of the Ryan Reynolds movie "Deadpool 2" in Vancouver, Canada, police confirmed Monday.
WorkSafeBC, British Columbia's OSHA equivalent, was on the scene along with law enforcement, the Vancouver Police Department said in a statement that promised further information as it becomes available.
The woman, whose name has not been released, was treated by an ambulance crew after the 8 a.m. crash but was pronounced dead on the scene, the Vancouver Sun reported. Witnesses told the newspaper they lost control, jumped a curb and slammed through the glass windows of an office building.
The woman successfully performed the stunt four times, but had a problem with the throttle on their fifth practice run and lost control when the engine engaged, according to Canada's Global News, which had a crew on the scene gathering information about a fatal bus crash that happened nearby on Sunday.
ISLAMABAD, Oct 6 (APP): Minister for Interior Ahsan Iqbal Friday said Directorate General of Immigration and Passport should review its current laws to further facilitate citizens and meet new challenges.
“We are living in the 21th century but relevant laws of
the department are too old,” they said during a briefing given
by the Director General Immigration and Passport Usman Akhtar Bajwa here.
The minister asked the Director General to take all the
stakeholders on board and update relevant laws which were too old and make them simple and effective.
“Agent Mafia and delay in the issuance of passport to
the public should be abandoned now and there should be no
compromise on black sheep in the department,” they said.
Usman Akhtar Bajwa briefed that the Immigration and
Passport Office had issued 4.3 million passports in a year
and generated revenue of over Rs 20 billion.
They said the department had issued 91 citizenship
certificates and dealt with 3,717 renunciation cases in
2016-17 besides only two cases of naturalization of
Somali citizens in 2014-15.
The Director General said that there were seven zones
of the department in which three were in Punjab and one each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Regarding the achievements of Passport Office from the
period 2013 to 2017, they said that number of passports had
increased by 30 percent as compared to previous 5 years and increase in the revenue was 35 percent.
In all, 84 Regional Passport Offices (RPOs) out of 164
and 74 Foreign Missions out of 91 were established during the tenure of the present government, they added.
To reduce queues, they said that all the branches of
National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) in 15 major cities were
collecting passport fee and payment of passport fee could
also be made through NBP Mobile/branchless banking
service.
Usman Akhtar said the other initiative was to eliminate
queues with the provision of facilities of Executive Passport
Offices, RPOs at district level, online passport renewal outside Pakistan, home delivery service in the country and home delivery service for online applicants abroad.
To improve the customers awareness, they said there were
several steps that had been taken including the launch of
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) in six languages which
received 300 calls per day.
They said the Passport and Immigration had also started
SMS Rabta Service for proactively seeking feedback from every applicant and over 250,000 SMSes were sent per month. The feedback system received 18000 to 25000 replies per month.
Usman Akhtar said that administrative action has been taken
on consistent complaints and over 65 officials including incharges at Regional Passport Offices were replaced.
Regarding the upgradation of Machine Readable Passport to
E-Passport, the Director General said that Prime Minister had
approved launch of the E-Passport project.
They said under the project, initially the validity of the
official and diplomatic E-Passports will be for 10 years.
The minister assured full support to the Directorate General
of Immigration and Passport to resolve the administrative and financial issues on priority basis.
This is the time of year where players get some time to themselves off the gridiron. Some choose to partake in their own crazy workouts, others become doctors -- literally. Bucs QB Jameis Winston has been using the offseason to surprise their fans in various ways. In April, Winston presented an unsuspecting FSU student manager with a scholarship. That same month, they surprised the students of a Tampa Bay elementary school with a "dream room" -- a state-of-the-art learning center.
Last week, the 2015 Pro Bowler kept the feel-good vibes going in this clip where they surprised a first grader in their hometown of Bessemer, Ala. The student, Brendan, had done a Black History Month report on the QB in February.
Back in February I was caught by surprise when a 1st grade student from my hometown selected me to report on for Black History Month. Last week I decided to repay the surprise. #DreamForever pic.twitter.com/CLhcpXlQay â Jameis Winston (@Jaboowins) May 22, 2018
"It was a surreal moment," said Winston. "I got to see them present the project that they had done -- it was very humbling. I wanted to be there and show them some support, to let them know that they were noticed and I am thankful for him."
Through their Dream Forever Foundation, Winston has put their own time and money toward giving back to the community that helped raise him.
"Every time I go home, I try to be that foundation for those kids to show them there is a better way out," said the 24-year-old. "I always make sure I'm talking to kids about education. I want to let those kids know that it's not about being an athlete, it's about being the best at whatever you choose to do."
The mission statement of the Dream Forever Foundation is to "impact the lives of financially disadvantaged children and youth through encouragement, opportunities, and resources to develop and achieve their dreams."
Winston said that each offseason, they strive to achieve this goal by providing free football camps, seminars, and Bible study for the youth. They believe the in-person interactions have a positive impact that can lead to changed lives.
"Our purpose is to help them with encouragement, resources, and opportunities," said Winston. "Not many kids get the opportunity to meet their idol, I know I wish I did. I'm from the same hometown as Bo Jackson, I wish Bo Jackson would've snuck in the classroom and surprised me."
After the mass shooting in Las Vegas politicians in Florida responded with thoughts and prayers for the victims, and in some cases policy.
As details about the shooting emerge some lawmakers are renewing calls for restrictions on certain types of firearms and accessories. So what's the political appetite in Florida for some of this legislation?
Former democratic state lawmaker, Dick Batchelor, and republican political analyst, Chris Carmody joined Intersection to talk about new firearms policies.
Batchelor said bump stocks, which make the firing rate of a semi-automatic weapon faster, should be just as difficult to get as an automatic weapon.
“If you had some hoops to jump through [to acquire an automatic weapon], wouldn't you not also require it for a device that will allow you to convert from a semi-automatic to an automatic?” Batchelor said.
Carmody said there is a glimmer of bipartisanship when it comes to putting more control on bump stocks. It just depends on filing the legislation and pushing it through, they said.
“It's certainly there, I kind of view the NRA or at least more specifically the second amendment as sort of like an allegiance to their favorite pro-sports team,” Carmody said.
“No matter how bad the team gets it seems as if you stick to the team.”
Batchelor and Carmody also discuss how elected leaders responded to hurricanes Maria and Irma. Politicians from both sides of the aisle have been visiting Puerto Rico to find out what the island needs as it begins the long road to recovery from the devastation of Hurricane Maria and how it could affect Florida.
DETROIT (AP) — Mike Matheson scored their first goal of the season and the Florida Panthers won in overtime for the first time this season, taking a 2-1 decision from the Detroit Red Wings on Monday night.
Matheson drove the rebound of a Nick Bjugstad shot into the net behind Detroit goalie Jimmy Howard at the 2:02 mark of the overtime period for the winner. Florida improved to 1-2 in OT, rallying from a 1-0 third-period deficit for the victory.
Vincent Trocheck also scored for the Panthers, while Henrik Zetterberg scored for the Wings, who are 0-5 in overtime.
Ending a 22-game goal drought, Zetterberg opened the scoring at the 18:27 mark of the first period. Panthers defenseman Matheson blocked Zetterberg's original shot, but the Detroit captain picked up the rebound and snapped a low shot through the pads of Florida goalie James Reimer.
The Panthers tied the score during a third-period power play at the 10:11 mark. Florida center Jonathan Huberdeau went down after being cross-checked by Red Wings defenseman Niklas Kronwall, but as they lay on the ice, Huberdeau slipped a pass back across the front of the net to Trocheck, whose quick shot banked into the Detroit net off the outstretched glove of Wings goalie Jimmy Howard.
NOTES: Panthers C Aleksandr Barkov, who leads the team with eight multi-point games, returned to the lineup after missing Saturday's 7-3 loss to the Colorado Avalanche with an upper-body injury. … Red Wings D/RW Luke Witkowski saw their first action since the conclusion of their 10-game NHL suspension for returning to the ice to rejoin a fight Nov. 9 against the Calgary Flames, and fought twice with Panthers C Micheal Haley, who leads the NHL with nine fighting majors.
UP NEXT
Panthers: In Chicago Tuesday to face the Blackhawks in the second game of their five-game road trip.
Red Wings: Play the fourth game of a five-game homestand Wednesday against the Boston Bruins.

Premier's office says the former NDP premier died after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease
Former British Columbia premier Dave Barrett has died at the age of 87.
A statement from Premier John Horgan's office says the former NDP premier died after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease.
They died today in Victoria.
Barrett was first elected to the B.C. legislature in 1960.
The former social worker from Vancouver became known as the champion of the little guy.
They were elected eight times as a provincial member of the legislature.
They were also elected as a federal New Democrat MP in 1988 in the former Victoria-area riding of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
Barrett made political history when their left leaning New Democrats defeated the five-term Social Credit juggernaut governments of W.A.C. Bennett in 1972.
They were B.C.'s first NDP premier and their three-year government from 1972 to 1975 was short-lived but enduring for its political accomplishments.
More coming.

President Rafael Correa called on citizens to concentrate next Saturday, April 22, from 09:00, at the de los Shyris Tribune, with flags of Ecuador, in favor of democracy, institutionality, and peace, “to say enough to bad losers.”
“Let´s go to Los Shyris street, in Quito, from 09:00, to a festival of music and joy because we, Democrats, are more, many more. At an international level everyone recognizes the victory of the citizens' revolution,” said Correa, after stating that the political opposition wants to generate instability and uncertainty.
The president explained that the concentration will be against “ignorance” towards the election results and the denunciation of alleged fraud by former presidential hopeful Guillermo Lasso (CREO-SUMA).
The National Electoral Council (CNE) approved the following numerical results of the runoff held on April 2: 51.15% for Lenin Moreno (AP) and 48.85% for Lasso.

Mujeeb has been exceptional with the bowl today and has been a thorn for the Delhi batting line-up. Their third over though saw an overpitched delivery which was instantly put away by Iyer for a much awaited boundary. Delhi makes that over count for 8 and are 96/5 after 15 overs. Shreyas Iyer and Rahul Tewatia have to pace themselves out perfectly if they want to pull of this chase.
Despite that off-kilter approach, the episode is likely to be among the series' most viewed. It focuses on Ross, a college dropout and former drug dealer who accidentally slips into an interview at one of Manhattan's top law firms, Pearson Specter. After seeing their photographic memory and intelligence in action, attorney Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) hires them on the spot, and for the remainder of the series Ross struggles to keep their nonexistent Harvard Law degree a secret. In the midst of all of this, Ross's relationship with the astute and tenacious paralegal, Zane, is a breath of fresh air.
Revenue growth is one of the first things analysts often look at when assessing a company's growth prospects. Investors want to see that a business can perpetually generate more sales over time, as it's difficult to generate higher profits if revenue is not rising.
While it's not easy to find strong revenue growth among the largest FTSE 100 companies at present, there are a selection of FTSE 250 companies that are increasing their revenues at an exceptional rate. Today I look at two such companies and examine whether they're priced to buy.
Playtech
£2.8bn market-cap Playtech (LSE: PTEC) designs software platforms for the online, mobile and land-based gaming industry. The gaming industry is a fast-growing area, and with the help of an aggressive acquisition strategy, the company has enjoyed incredible revenue rises in recent years.
Indeed, revenue has climbed from €142m in FY2010 to €630m in FY2015, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of an impressive 35%. The company reports its FY2016 final numbers on 23 February and analysts forecast revenue to come in at €725m, a 15% increase on last year.
However, despite the strong revenue hikes, shares in Playtech don't look overly expensive. Consensus earnings estimates are €0.67 for FY2016 and €0.84 for FY2017, meaning that Playtech trades on a P/E of 15.6, falling to a low 12.5 for FY2017.
Although the company has performed extremely well for shareholders in the last five years, returning around 30% per year, in my opinion the growth story still has plenty of legs. The company stated in January that the board remains “confident of further growth in 2017 and beyond” and as such I reckon Playtech has strong appeal at the current valuation.
GVC Holdings
Multinational sports betting and gaming group GVC Holdings (LSE: GVC) has also enjoyed strong revenue rises in recent years. The company's top line has climbed from €55m in FY2010 to €248m in FY2015, a CAGR of 35%, yet after the game-changing acquisition of bwin last year, analysts now anticipate FY2016 revenue of a lofty €865m.
GVC's share price has run hard in the last 15 months, rising from around 370p in late 2015, to now trade at 700p. Does that mean it's too late to buy? In my opinion, no.
While FY2016 earnings are forecast to come in at a low €0.33 per share, earnings are expected to rise 70% to €0.56 for FY2017. That places the company on an undemanding FY2017 P/E ratio of just under 15.
Management recently stated that “the positive trading momentum experienced in 2016 has continued with a particularly strong start in 2017” and that “we see a lot of organic growth opportunities for the group in 2017 and beyond.”
With the company on target to achieve significant synergies from the bwin acquisition and analysts forecasting a considerable dividend hike in FY2017, I believe GVC has long-term appeal, especially now the shares have moved from AIM to the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
Looking for a top growth share? As illustrated by Playtech and GVC Holdings, when it comes to finding stocks that have explosive growth potential, it pays to look outside the FTSE 100 index. With that in mind, I recommend taking a look at the stock listed in this exclusive Motley Fool report: A top growth stock. The company detailed in the report has seen its share price rise by a huge 270% over the last five years, yet analysts at the Fool reckon there's plenty more to come.

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans on Friday released a partisan and bitterly disputed memo that they say shows surveillance abuses in the early stages of the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.
The memo, prepared by Republicans on the House intelligence committee, says there was "a troubling breakdown of legal processes" in the Russia investigation.
President Donald Trump, who advocated for the memo's release over the fierce objections of the Justice Department and the FBI, told reporters the document shows "a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves."
"I think it's terrible," Trump said. "You want to know the truth. I think it's a disgrace. What's going on in this country, I think it's a disgrace."
The memo, which the FBI has said is inaccurate and missing critical context, asserts that current and former FBI and Justice Department leaders signed off on a surveillance warrant to monitor communications of a former Trump campaign associate.
The document also asserts that opposition research, conducted by a British spy and funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign, formed a critical basis for the allegations contained in the warrant application.
They say that research should not have been a basis for the warrant because it contains unproven allegations.
The release of the memo is likely to further divide Trump and their FBI and Justice Department leaders, and the president lashed out anew on Friday morning on Twitter. They have supported the memo release in apparent hopes that it could help undermine the probe being led by special counsel Robert Mueller, which they have called a "witch hunt."
"The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!" Trump tweeted.

Do you hate leaving your pup at home alone? With Laïka, they won't be!
French company CamToy recently launched an Indiegogo campaign for Laïka, an interactive smart companion for your dog. Laïka lets you keep an eye on your pets, play with them and give them treats, even if you aren't at home.
See at Indiegogo
How does it work?
Laïka is a little robot a bit like a Roomba that connects to the Laïka app on your smart phone. It's completely chew-proof, and is equipped with a camera, microphone, treat dispenser and speaker. It also comes with its own charging base that it rolls into when your dog has finished playing.
What can it do?
Laïka interacts with your dog in the following ways:
Multidirectional movement: Laïka has multidirectional movement capabilities, meaning you can control it with your phone a bit like a remote-control car in order to play with your dog in a fun and enriching way.

AI: Laïka learns and analyzes your furry friend's behavioral patterns and adapts to their lifestyle. While playing with your pup, Laïka will note what sort of play and rewards are successful and what fails, so it can become the best suited companion for their individual needs.

Speaker: Perhaps the sweetest and most heart-melting feature of all, Laïka has an integrated speaker so you can talk to your dog while you're away. You can comfort them if they're whining, tell them they've been good, and even read them bedtime stories if that's something you guys have established as a routine for yourselves.

Treat tosser: Laïka is outfitted with a refillable treat tosser so you can reward your dog when you see them exhibiting good behavior (or just give them a treat because it's fun and you love them a lot). According to the company, this will also allow you to train your dog even when you're not physically around to do it:
Laïka will also be a useful tool in educating your dog. Thanks to the application you'll be able to access lots of advice to help you teach your pup some tricks like sit, lay down and speak. The best part is, Laïka will reward them once they've done it well!
Though Laïka is marketed specifically to dogs, I suspect it would be good enrichment for any medium-to-large house pet. Laïka will retail for $500, but if you support it now on Indiegogo you can get it for nearly half price — $275.
Note: Backing crowdfunded projects involves a certain level of risk. Though this project is already over 100% funded, please know that there is still a chance it may never come to fruition.
Thoughts?

PHILADELPHIA (AP)  A singer, songwriter and producer who helped create the "The Sound of Philadelphia" in the 1970s has died. Walter "Bunny" Sigler was 76.
Their longtime attorney, Lloyd Zane Remick, said Sigler died of a heart attack Friday at their home outside Philadelphia.
Sigler worked with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff in developing a genre that blended soul, funk and big band styles, and cemented the city in the country's musical landscape with its lush horn ensembles and smooth vocals.
Gamble says Sigler was one of the most talented songwriters and producers they ever worked with.

As a performer, Sigler was known for such hits as "Let the Good Times Roll & (Feel So Good)." Their career spanned decades and saw collaborations with acts as varied as Patti LaBelle and Jay-Z.
UNITED NATIONS : North Korea is preparing for “any mode of war” triggered by US military action, Pyongyang's envoy to the United Nations warned Monday, saying their country would respond to a missile or nuclear strike “in kind.”
The statement from N Korea's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Kim In Ryong, followed warnings from US Vice President Mike Pence to Pyongyang not to test US resolve. “If the US dares opt for a military action (...) the DPRK is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the Americans,” Kim told a news conference at UN headquarters in NY. “We will take the toughest counteraction against the provocateurs,” they said. North Korea has taken “self-defensive” measures in response to US threats of military action and these reflect Pyongyang's determination to “counter nukes and ICBM in kind,” Kim said, referring to intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Pence earlier told a news conference in South Korea that “the era of strategic patience is over” after North Korea on Sunday test-fired another missile and fears mounted that it may be preparing a sixth nuclear test.
Pyongyang is seeking to develop a long-range missile capable of hitting the US mainland with a nuclear warhead, and has so far staged five nuclear tests, two of them last year.
Kim also confirmed that a new nuclear test was under preparation, saying that the plans had been announced and that “it will take place.”
“As far as nuclear test is concerned, it was already announced to the public. It is something that our headquarters decided. At a time and at the place where our headquarters deem necessary, it will take place,” they said.

Emmy Awards format likely to be changed by TV networks, low-profile awards may get dropped out of ceremony
Prior to the announcement of annual Primetime Emmy Awards nominees, the Television Academy is to finalise a contract with four major television networks, ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox in the US for the rights to the live ceremony, reported Variety.
The terms of the deal include the four networks hosting the Emmys in rotation as well as a slight rise in the license fee (around $8.25 million a year), found Deadline but also the decision to push lower profile categories out of the show, an issue that is still being worked out.
Executives of the TV Academy are starting an outreach with Writers Guild of America (WGA), Director's Guild of America (DGA) and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) on how to change the telecast so that there is enough airtime to incorporate entertainment content.
These guilds have a say over the process as they grant residual waivers for clips shown during the ceremony without which the cost of producing the live telecast would increase.
This concern comes after similar award shows like Oscars saw a steady decline in viewership. Deadline reported that a compromise will be reached at before the show's telecast on 17 September.
Currently, the TV Academy has 26 awards for the ceremony. According to Variety, the networks are not going to trim down specific number of awards. Instead, they hope to shift categories around the plans of the telecast producer.

Ontario Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford was in London on Wednesday evening for a rally at the London Convention Centre on York Street.
Cheers of “Doug, Doug, Doug” filled the air shortly after Ford was introduced by PC candidate for London North Centre Susan Truppe.

Along with Truppe, Ford was joined by two other PC candidates running in the Forest City: Jeff Yurek from Elgin-Middlesex-London and Eric Weniger from London-Fanshawe.
London West candidate Andrew Lawton was again absent from Ford's visit. However, the former 980 CFPL talk show host did tweet that they were out canvassing in their riding a few minutes before the doors opened for Ford's rally.

Ford opened with a similar message heard at Monday's stop in Peterborough, telling the crowd of a couple hundred supporters, “The NDP and the Liberals are watching and they are scared.”
“We know we're going to send Kathleen Wynne packing,” said Ford. “What is even scarier and 10 times worse than the Liberals is the NDP. I look in this crowd and I know many of you experienced the ‘Rae Days.'”
Ford spoke for just under 15 minutes promising to bring “prosperity, opportunity and growth back to the people of Ontario.”
The Ontario PC leader alluded to the party's plan with promises to reduce hydro rates and promote economic growth. Ford reiterated their party's guaranteed $850 income tax break for minimum-wage workers and Ford expressed a need for more nurses, doctors and teachers in Ontario.
Support for voices from the health-care industry was brought up along with the promise to end “hallway health care.”
“We're going to invest $1.9 billion into mental health, addiction and housing support over 10 years,” said Ford. “We're going to support over 100,000 seniors in this province to make sure they have proper dental care.”
When Ford made their visit, the Ontario PC party had not yet released a fully costed platform, but have published a detailed list of their campaign promises titled, “For The People: A Plan for Ontario.”

Earlier in the day, Ford paid a visit to Mount Brydges where they were joined by Lambton-Kent-Middlesex candidate Monte McNaughton.
Prior to the rally, the Ontario PC leader could be seen rolling dough at Angelo's Italian Bakery and Market on Wonderland Road accompanied by Truppe.
The rally comes just days before the Ontario general election, scheduled for June 7.
Had a great time visiting Cranberri Country Market this afternoon. Our plan will reduce hydro bills by 12% and reduce the small business tax rate by 8.7%. The Ontario PCs will bring real change and relief for small businesses. #onpoli #onelxn pic.twitter.com/nACqetBFbQ — Doug Ford (@fordnation) May 30, 2018
WASHINGTON (CQ-Roll Call/TNS) -
Wednesday, May 30, 2018 at 5:20 pm |
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaking to the media after a policy luncheon on Capitol Hill earlier this month. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's aggressive summer legislative agenda features floor time for bundles of spending bills, as well as three major authorizations.
The Kentucky Republican said they would prioritize the fiscal 2019 defense authorization, a new farm bill and updated water resources development legislation.
McConnell did not seem to envision a summer full of votes on “gotcha” amendments targeting vulnerable senators (almost entirely Democrats in 2018).
“I'm not particularly interested in just having point-scoring amendments, although some of the bills that I call up are open for amendment and people may, on both sides, may do some of that,” McConnell said. “I'm mainly interested in scoring points, putting points on the board, passing bills that will be signed into law.”
Among the items not on the summer agenda? A floor debate over an updated authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, with an uncertain outcome.
“Without presidential support, I can't imagine I would call up an AUMF,” McConnell said. “It would be a debate reminiscent of the week we spent on immigration back in February which, you know, we spun our wheels for a week and passed nothing.”
“I don't have the time … to waste on things that are going nowhere,” McConnell said.
Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee and Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia have led the drafting of a compromise AUMF that's been the subject a Foreign Relations Committee hearing, but the joint resolution has skeptics on both sides of the aisle.
“If it came out of the House and the president said they were for it, I'd obviously consider it,” they said. “What I'm not interested in doing is having another week, and certainly not more than one week, as I said yesterday, spinning our wheels and getting nowhere.”
McConnell was well aware, however, that related issues like funding for Trump's desired wall at the border with Mexico might well come up as part of appropriations amendment debate.
“When you go to a bill like that, you've got to work your way through the amendment process, and that's the way the Senate works,” McConnell said. “You just have to be determined to finish, and when I call up a bill, I'm going to be determined to finish.”
Speaking with Roll Call in an interview just ahead of Memorial Day, McConnell also reiterated that they would not have floor time available for potential House-passed immigration-related legislation unless President Donald Trump indicated they would sign such a measure, and even then might want more assurance the bill would have the votes to get past filibuster threats in the Senate.
McConnell has maintained their seat as a senior member of the Appropriations Committee during their time as leader.  They are substantially involved in the process of trying to work with the House so that bills arrive from the other side of the Capitol building in a way that minimizes obstacles in the Senate.
“From a parliamentary point of view, they need to bunch them before they come over to us, but the goal is to move as many of the bills as we can in minibuses of two or three bills each,” McConnell said. “We're in coordination with the House.”
So far, procedural objections appear to be under control.
“We anticipate, for example, in the Senate being able to get on these bills without a motion to proceed, which would be a great step in the right direction by the minority,” McConnell said. “There seems to be pretty broad agreement across party lines that we want to get these bills done and not have the ending that we had last year.”
The best-made plans could certainly go off track, as attempts to get the spending bills processed on time almost always do. But that may be part of the majority leader's talking about the possibility of curtailing the 2018 August recess.
But McConnell seems to be on a mission to avoid calling up measures that will face blockades, at least for now.
“I'm not into playing games this summer. I want to accomplish things, and everything I've mentioned to you that we're going to be working on are things that we need to do,” McConnell said.
It probably helps that McConnell has only one incumbent Republican with a hotly contested re-election campaign this year: Nevada Sen. Dean Heller.
“We're on defense basically in three places. We have an incumbent leaving in Tennessee, an incumbent leaving in Arizona and an incumbent running in Nevada,” McConnell said. “On offense, we have a whole array of promising targets: Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia, Florida, and it looks like Ohio could end up on the list, as well.”
Every one of the races on the majority leader's “offense” scorecard features a Democratic senator seeking another term.
The aggressive legislating will have to work within the confines of limited time for floor debate. McConnell plans to continue prioritizing confirmation of judicial nominations. And there is another nomination to Trump's Cabinet to consider as well.
Senate Veterans Affairs Chairman Johnny Isakson of Georgia told reporters last week they would be working to schedule a hearing early in June on the nomination of Robert Wilkie, the current undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, to be VA secretary.
Wilkie has been serving as the acting VA secretary.
In other interviews last week, including with Fox News, McConnell advised people who serve and work on the Senate side of the Capitol not to make firm summer vacation plans, given the possibility in session.
“I'll have more to say definitively about that the week after next, but I've said to all the press corps and the members up here I wouldn't buy any nonrefundable tickets.” McConnell said.

If you thought bunnies made for a great gift this Easter, some pet stores in Lethbridge say that's not often the case and can lead to an increase in abandoned bunnies. Katelyn Wilson reports.
Industry mouthpiece techUK has thrown its tuppence into the debate around what Blighty's communications infrastructure should look like in 2020, calling for "near-universal" superfast broadband of 30Mbps.
The report, From Good to Great: Digital Connectivity for a World Class Economy, said the key features of a world-class connectivity in 2020 would be "widely available" ultrafast connectivity of 100Mbps.
"By 2025 we would expect to see at least 90 per cent of premises having ultrafast connections available to them driven by clear market demand," it said.
"To achieve great connectivity, we must enable two things: more fibre across our telecoms networks, and 5G wireless solutions to be rolled out swiftly."
It did not provide much detail on how this wish list would be achieved, but unsurprisingly said "collaboration" with industry would be key (with that word mentioned 13 times in the doc).
According to a recent report, the UK ranks 31st in the world, with average speeds of 16.51Mbps. However, those figures represent takeup rather than availability.
BT recently offered to stump up £600m to provide ubiquitous minimum broadband speeds of 10Mbps by 2022. However, a proposal in the House of Lords had previously suggested the universal service obligation ought to be 30Mbps.
Meanwhile, the Independent Networks Co-operative Association has called for a series of regulatory changes that would enable commercial deployment of 80 per cent of fibre-to-the-premise coverage by 2026, which would be capable of 1Gbps.
Julian David, chief at techUK, said: "As the UK looks to reposition itself as Global Britain, improving digital infrastructure will also incentivise investment and innovation necessary to raise productivity and deliver economic growth for the whole country." ®

The knee injury to MVP candidate Carson Wentz thrust backup Nick Foles into the spotlight for a Philadelphia Eagles team that clinched the NFC East and is on pace for a playoff bye.
In Sunday's 43-35 victory over the Los Angeles Rams, Foles helped lead a comeback victory, completing 6 of 10 passes for 42 yards. The offense was clearly restricted with Foles entering late, but a pivotal pass to Nelson Agholor helped salt away the win.
After the win, the 28-year-old veteran quarterback said he's prepared to lead the division champs as long as needed.
"I'm absolutely ready. That's why I'm here," Foles said, via the team's official website. "So I'm ready to go I prepare every day, work every day -- if need be.
"Coach [Doug] Pederson showed a lot of confidence with me and I have a long history with him. They know I can go out and play so we'll see what happens."
With Foles under center, the Eagles must rely on a bruising ground game, led by Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount, and Corey Clement. It's telling that when Foles entered Sunday's tilt Ajayi was the only back to earn a carry. The Eagles will need Ajayi's explosive ability sans Wentz.
Wentz's injury casts a pall on Philadelphia's outstanding season and thrusts questions about how far they can go in January. On the plus side, winning the division with three weeks left affords Pederson and Foles a chance to tinker before the postseason starts.
"Everyone's really excited because we put in a lot of work this season. We've won a lot of games. Great team effort," Foles said. "Carson's been a big piece of that puzzle. Everyone's been excited about the win, yeah, but when you have your starting quarterback go down, it's emotional.
"It was emotional for me, I work with them every day. We do everything together. I'm excited we won but at the same time, I'm dealing with it emotionally with them going down. You never want that."
We're constantly berated by coaches preaching 'next man up' philosophy to deal with injuries. Foles is that next man for the Eagles. The backup quarterback could be the difference between a Super Bowl team and another season of falling short in Philadelphia.
Dianne Watts' first-choice lead didn't grow enough for outsider to win
Round five results
Cheers went up in the Wall Centre hotel as Vancouver-Quilchena MLA Andrew Wilkinson reaped enough points from second and third choices to win the B.C. Liberal leadership with 4,621 points.
Wilkinson thanked the other candidates and reminded party members of the come-from-behind election win by Christy Clark in 2013 and the landslide victory led by Gordon Campell in 2001.
“Think about fiscal responsibility, that we are the party that does not spend our children's money,” Wilkinson told a boisterous crowd. “All of us have to come together now.”
Dianne Watts finished with 4,075 points.
Round four results
Dianne Watts held onto the lead, but with 3,006 points, a fifth round is required to decide the contest.
Andrew Wilkinson jumped into second place with 2,862 points, narrowly beating out fellow Vancouver MLA Michael Lee with 2,832. That means Lee drops from the ballot and the fifth round decides the leadership.
Results coming in faster than before.. ROUND 4:
Andrew Wilkinson now in front of Michael Lee, who's officially out. Dianne Watts still in lead.

Round two results
Dianne Watts remained in the lead, but gained little with 2,169 points in round two of B.C. Liberal leadership votes.
Micheal Lee held on to second with 1,960 points, followed by Andrew Wilkinson in third with 1,631.
Todd Stone was fourth with 1,505, and Mike de Jong reached 1,436, not enough to stay in the contest.
The redistribution of de Jong's total is a key turning point as the results go to a third round.

BLAST OFF! SpaceX plans to launch an unmanned Falcon 9 rocket with research and supplies at 12:31 p.m. More: http://bit.ly/2uD3C2Y Posted by WINK News on Monday, August 14, 2017
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) SpaceX just launched a few tons of research to the International Space Station – plus ice cream.
An unmanned Falcon 9 rocket took off just after 12:30 p.m. Monday from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.
Experiments make up most of the 6,400 pounds of cargo. That includes 20 mice. The Dragon capsule is also doubling as an ice cream truck this time. There was extra freezer space, so NASA packed little cups of vanilla, chocolate and birthday cake ice cream for the station's crew of six, as well as ice cream candy bars. Those treats should be especially welcomed by U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson, in orbit since November.
As usual on these cargo flights, SpaceX will try to land its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral.

It might seem like the rich know something about money that the rest of us don't. After all, the richest 1 percent of people now hold almost half of the world's wealth, according to the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report.
Maybe the rich do have secrets to accumulating wealth — but that doesn't mean what they know has to remain a mystery. Use these strategies so you can build your own wealth, too.
Spending must align with goals
One of the keys to being rich is having goals, said Michael Kay, president of Financial Life Focus and author of “The Feel Rich Project.”
“They know what they care about,” they said. “Maybe it's passing wealth to another generation, maybe it's attaining a particular lifestyle. They are mindful of not wasting resources on things that have no value.”
According to Kay, the wealthy only seem to spend money on things that they care about. The rest of us can learn from this by setting our own goals and then monitoring our spending to see if it aligns with those goals.
“Are you really spending in accordance with what you value?” asked Kay. “Do the beliefs and realities jive?”
Don't waste money
to impress
others
Most rich people don't spend their time and money trying to impress others. “They are not in a race,” Kay said. “They know they have made it, so their attention is not on what others think.”
In fact, many wealthy individuals wouldn't have become rich if they had spent their hard-earned money buying things to keep up with others, they said. Living below their means and rejecting big-spending lifestyles are key secrets of the country's richest people, according to the best-selling book, “The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy.”
Spending money to appear rich before you actually are is a surefire way to sabotage your wealth-building goals. So, forget about the Joneses and focus on what matters: accumulating your wealth in the coming years. If you're determined to appear rich but don't want to spend money, use these insider strategies.
Have plenty of liquidity
The rich make sure they have sufficient liquidity, or cash, to cover their short-term needs. They have an emergency fund, so “they don't have to disrupt their life for an unexpected occurrence,” Kay said.
The fact that rich people have money set aside for rainy days isn't solely a function of their wealth. They have cash reserves because they are disciplined enough to save.
Everyone should aim to build an emergency fund with enough cash to cover six to nine months of expenses, Kay said. However, you don't have to set that much aside all at once. You just need to be working toward that goal with every paycheck. With that in mind, you should arrange to have a set amount automatically transferred from your checking account to savings each month.
“Like anything else, it's a goal,” Kay said. “It only makes you a failure if you're not working on it.”
Avoid fees at all costs
Fees can easily eat away at your wealth. Whether it's a late fee on a credit payment, a foreign transaction fee from using a debit card abroad or an overdraft fee on your checking account, it's important to avoid incurring unnecessary fees.
“Wealthy people understand every fee they pay means less money in their pockets,” said Taylor Schulte, CEO of Define Financial in San Diego.
Know what you're paying in
investment fees
The rich also pay attention to investment fees — something that many people overlook. For example, more than half of workers don't know they're paying fees on their workplace retirement savings accounts, according to a study by the National Association of Retirement Plan Participants. Yet, those fees can eat away at your returns, Schulte said.
“The more you're paying in mutual fund fees or transaction fees means less money in your pocket,” they said.
Even small fees can have a big impact. If you invest $100,000 over 20 years and pay a 1 percent annual fee, your portfolio value will be about $30,000 less than if you had paid a 0.25 percent annual fee, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.
Check your account statement to see what fees you're paying. If they seem high, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy recommends asking whether the costs can be reduced. You also should shop around for accounts and investment firms with low fees. Then, you'll be able to keep more of the money you worked hard to save.
Asset location is as important as asset allocation
If you've read anything about investing and saving for retirement, you've likely encountered advice about asset allocation. That means having the right mix of investments, rather than putting all of your money in just one asset. However, the rich know that asset location is just as important as asset allocation, Schulte said.
In other words, the rich don't keep all of their assets in one type of account, such as a tax-deferred retirement savings account. Wealthy people also have investments in brokerage accounts to limit the impact of taxes in retirement, Schulte said.
Choose the right
retirement savings account
You can earn an upfront tax benefit by contributing to a 401k or similar plan because contributions come out of your paycheck before taxes — lowering your taxable income — and the money grows tax-deferred. But when you withdraw that money in retirement, it will be taxed at your regular income tax rate — which is currently as high as 39.6 percent for the wealthiest taxpayers.
You don't get any tax breaks by investing in stocks, bonds or mutual funds through a brokerage account. But if you hold those investments for more than a year, they'll be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate, which ranges from 0 percent to 20 percent but tops out at 15 percent for most taxpayers.
The types of investments you have in your accounts can have a dramatic effect on your long-term returns, Schulte said. Typically, it's best to keep securities, such as bonds, mutual funds and dividend-paying stocks, in tax-deferred retirement savings accounts. Then, keep your individual stocks in brokerage accounts.
New Delhi: Income Tax refunds worth over Rs 70,000 crore have been issued to the taxpayers and nearly all refund claims pending as on June-end has been processed, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said on Wednesday.
The Income Tax Department had observed a dedicated fortnight from 1-15 June, which was later extended to 30 June in certain regions, to expeditiously clear pending matters of appeal effect and rectification.
More than 20,000 such matters were disposed of and refunds were issued to the taxpayers, wherever due.
The CBDT said large amounts of refunds have also been issued consequent to the processing of income-tax returns.
"More than 99 percent of all refund claims pending for processing as on 30 June, 2018, have already been processed and the refunds due have been issued to the taxpayers," the CBDT said in a statement.
In all, refunds in 45.07 lakh cases have been issued during April-June, 2018, which is 9 lakh more than the refunds issued during the same period last year, it added.
Over 3 lakh refunds of Assessment Year 2018-19, for which returns have been filed only in last few weeks, have also been issued, the CBDT said.
"More than Rs 70,000 crore of refunds have been issued to the taxpayers as a result of the special drive and expeditious processing of returns involving claim of refunds," it said.
"CBDT is committed to constantly reducing the service delivery timelines, expeditiously resolving the grievances of the taxpayers and improving the overall level of taxpayer service," the statement added.

Shares of Tesco (LSE: TSCO) have been languishing below 200p since the end of January. How soon can they get back above that level? What are the company's longer-term prospects? And are the shares worth buying today?
I think there are three key factors that will determine Tesco's future.
1. Changing marketplace
The supermarket sector is in the midst of structural change. The days when people did one big weekly shop at their favourite out-of-town grocer are long gone. Food shopping has become much more of a pick ‘n' mix affair. Online ordering and home delivery, the return of supermarkets to the high street via convenience stores, a renaissance in independent shops and farmers markets, and the growth of no-frills chains are all part of a rich tapestry of shifting shopping habits.
Tesco had over a third of the grocery market in its heyday but its share is now down to under 28%. There may be further erosion as budget chains Aldi and Lidl continue to expand aggressively, but Tesco's turnaround under chief executive Dave Lewis appears to be gaining traction. I believe it can retain its position as the UK's biggest supermarket, although with a lower market share and lower margins than it once possessed.
2. Turnaround on track
I saw a number of encouraging things in Tesco's 2016/17 results last week, including group revenue and volume growth and the first like-for-like sales growth in the UK since 2009/10. I particularly liked the step-up seen in group operating margin from 1.8% to 2.3%, which encourages me to believe that management's target of 3.5% to 4% by 2019/20 is achievable.
The consensus of City analysts for 2019/20 is for an operating margin at the bottom of the range on revenue of just under £61bn, and earnings per share of about 16p. At a current share price of 179p, this would give a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.2.
If Tesco meets the City consensus forecasts, I would expect the trailing P/E three years from now to be more like the FTSE 100 long-term trailing average of 16, which would require a share price of 256p. This would be 43% higher than today's 179p, and give a total return of over 50% including forecast dividends. I see this as an attractive proposition for a blue-chip giant, particularly as it's based on an operating margin at the bottom end of Tesco's ambitions. If the margin proves to be nearer the top end, the upside for the stock could be considerably higher.
3. Booker prize
Finally, the third key factor for Tesco's prospects is its agreed takeover of food wholesaler Booker Group, which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Tesco has the support of most of its biggest investors, although two have come out against the deal on the grounds of ‘valuation' and ‘distraction'.
My view is that Dave Lewis has done an excellent job of getting Tesco back on track and that management is to be trusted on the timing, rationale and price being paid for the acquisition of Booker. Having said that, it was after the announcement of the deal that Tesco's shares fell back below 200p. So, while I rate the stock a ‘buy' today, the question of the Booker acquisition may weigh on the price for a while yet.
It's getting serious between Dakota Fanning and Henry Frye.
Fanning, who stars on TNT's “The Alienist,” was with their camera-shy boyfriend Saturday at Gurney's Montauk Yacht Club celebrating their latest magazine cover with DuJour publisher Jason Binn.
Sources say they are going to Cape Cod this weekend to meet the parents of the 6-foot-6 preppie, who played basketball for the posh Collegiate School for boys before going to the University of Vermont.
The two have been a couple since this past fall.
Fanning said in February's Vogue Australia: “I can't wait to be a mom. I can't wait to get married. Not yet, but those things are very important to me and I think about them.”
They have a tremendous track record, dating back decades. The Children's Therapy Center of the Quad Cities serves about four hundred fifty children a year.
The center has a new look. Now located in Rock Island, the center has twenty four thousand square feet. Thirteen thousand of that is therapy and office space according to President Angie Peterson.
There is more space to store equipment. More space for children to play and get the therapy they need.
Families often turn to the therapy center when they have no other place to go.The Children's Therapy Center never turns a family away. The center offers financial assistance to help assist with a child's medical bills.
The center is only about one hundred thousand dollars shy of successfully completing the one point two million dollar capital campaign. So many kind and generous people believe in the mission
of the Children's Therapy Center of the Quad Cities. A mission which hopefully will continue for years to come!
Franck Ribery netted a rare Bundesliga goal as Bayern Munich eased to an eighth consecutive league victory with a 2-0 win over Mainz on Saturday.
After a sluggish first half-hour, the veteran Frenchman put Bavaria ahead on 33 minutes. Picking up a poorly cleared corner on the edge of the box, they released a fizzing half-volley to score only their second league goal of the season.
James Rodriguez then doubled the lead just before half-time, elegantly bringing the ball down on their chest before volleying it past Robin Zentner.
"We were exhausted at the end," Bavaria centre-back Mats Hummels told Sky Sport. "Mainz passed the ball well, but we deserved to win."
The win means that Bayern are now 18 points clear of Bayer Leverkusen and RB Leipzig at the top of the table.
English forward Ademola Lookman scored a late winner on their Bundesliga debut as Leipzig beat Borussia Moenchengladbach to return to the top four.
In a scrappy game on Saturday evening, Lookman came off the bench to score after joining on loan from Everton on deadline day, squeezing the ball past Tobias Sippel to secure victory in the 89th minute.
"He showed straight away that they have quality in one-on-one situations," said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl of Lookman. "That was a really important win for us."
Victory saw Leipzig move up to third, drawing level on points with Bayer Leverkusen, who laboured to a 0-0 draw with Freiburg.
Lucas Alario hit the post for Leverkusen early in the game, but there were more yellow cards than chances, as seven players were booked and Freiburg once again frustrated a top team.
"It was a heated game," Leverkusen's Julian Brandt told Sky. "We knew in advance that it wouldn't be easy to come to Freiburg."
Pavlenka error costs Schalke
Leverkusen, though, remain in second after Schalke once again dropped points. Both teams profited from goalkeeping errors in Gelsenkirchen, as a late goal saw Werder Bremen snatch a surprise 2-1 victory.
A catastrophic mistake from Jiri Pavlenka gifted Schalke the lead on 24 minutes. Yevhen Konoplyanka's speculative effort flew straight at the Bremen goalkeeper, who allowed the ball to slip through theirs fingers.
"These things happen, it just looks stupid because they are the last man," said striker Max Kruse in Pavlenka's defence. "We all made mistakes on the pitch today."
With 11 minutes to go there was more farcical goalkeeping as Ralf Faehrmann allowed Kruse to equalise for Bremen.
After Matija Nastasic was sent off for a second bookable offence, Faehrmann fumbled the resulting free-kick, allowing the ball to bounce out of their hands and into the path of Kruse.
It would get worse for Schalke in stoppage time, as Zlatko Junuzovic stabbed a loose ball past Faehrmann to claim a dramatic and invaluable victory for relegation-threatened Bremen.
VfB Stuttgart hold Wolfsburg
In the lower half of the table, Mario Gomez scored against their former club to rescue a point for VfB Stuttgart, as they welcomed new coach Tayfun Korkut with a 1-1 draw in Wolfsburg.
Liverpool loanee Divock Origi put Wolfsburg in front on 24 minutes, curling a long-range shot into the bottom corner.
Gomez, who left Wolfsburg for Stuttgart in January, levelled the scores on the hour mark, prodding the ball home from close range.
In Saturday's other game, Hoffenheim extended their winless run to five matches after throwing away a 1-0 lead to draw at Hertha Berlin.
Andrej Kramaric gave Hoffenheim the lead from the penalty spot on 39 minutes, but Salomon Kalou's header drew the home side level just before the hour mark.
On Friday, Michy Batshuayi scored twice on their debut for Borussia Dortmund after joining on loan from Chelsea as their new club won 3-2 at bottom side Cologne.

As many as 39 crimes against women were reported every hour in India, up from 21 in 2007, according to Crime in India 2016 report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).
The rate of crime against women – crimes per 100,000 female population – was 55.2 in 2016, up from 41.7 in 2012.
The year 2016 saw the lowest conviction rate (18.9 percent) – percentage of cases convicted to cases in which trials were completed by the courts – for crimes against women in a decade.
As many as 2.5 million crimes against women have been reported in India over the last decade. Reported cases of crime against women increased 83 percent from 185,312 in 2007 to 338,954 in 2016.
"More than the increase in crime rate, it is an increase in reporting," Flavia Agnes, women's rights lawyer and co-founder of Majlis, a non-profit that provides legal services to women and children, told IndiaSpend.
"There are no mechanisms to analyse such events," said Agnes. "I feel that due to media pressure on certain brutally violent incidents, there is greater awareness, and women are coming forward to report crimes."
Delhi reported the highest crime rate against women
The union territory of Delhi reported the highest crime rate – 160.4 against the national average of 55.2. Delhi was followed by Assam (131.3), Odisha (84.5), Telangana (83.7) and Rajasthan (78.3).
Uttar Pradesh – India's most populous state – reported the most (15 percent) crimes against women in 2016 – 49,262, or six every hours. UP was followed by West Bengal (32,513), Maharashtra (31,388), Rajasthan (27,422) and Madhya Pradesh (26,604).
As many as 13,803 crimes against women were reported in Delhi city, or 38 every day, topping the list among 19 cities with populations more than two million in 2016, IndiaSpend reported on 1 December, 2017.
Delhi city had the worst crime rate, 182.1 crimes per 100,000 women, against the national average of 77.2.
Cruelty by husband/relatives most reported crime against women in 2016
"Cruelty by husband or their relatives" was the most reported crime against women, accounting for 33 percent of all crimes in 2016 – 110,378 cases or 13 crimes every hour. Cases reported under this crime head increased 45 percent from 75,930 in 2007.
Cruelty by husband/relatives was followed by cases reported under "assault on women with intent to outrage their modesty" (25 percent), "kidnapping and abduction of women" (19 percent) and "rape" (11 percent).
West Bengal reported the most cases of "cruelty by husband or their relatives" in 2016–19,302, or two every hours. Assam had the highest crime rate (58.7) in 2016 compared to the national average of 18.
As many as 84,746 cases of "assault on women with intent to outrage their modesty" were reported in 2016, or 10 cases every hour. Maharashtra reported the most cases in 2016–11,396, or one every hour. Delhi was the worst in crime rate (43.6), against the national average of 13.8.
Crimes covered under "assault on a woman with intent to outrage their modesty" include relatively more serious crimes such as 'sexual harassment', 'assault or use of criminal force to women with intent to disrobe', 'voyeurism' and 'stalking'.
The most cases under "kidnapping and abduction of women" were registered in Uttar Pradesh (12,994) with 65,519 cases nationwide, Delhi reported the highest crime rate (40.7) in 2016.
Four rape cases reported every hour in 2016, from 2 nine years ago
Four rape cases were reported every hour in the country in 2016, up from two every hour in 2007. Madhya Pradesh registered the most cases (4,882), while Sikkim reported the highest crime rate for rape (30.3). The nationwide crime rate was 6.3.
Reported rape cases have increased 88 percent from 20,737 in 2007 to 38,947 in 2016.
Of 39,068 rape victims in 2016, 43 percent were girls below 18 years. Offenders were known to the victim in 95 percent reported cases. Of these, 29 percent were "neighbours", "known persons on a promise to marry the victim" (27 percent) and "other known persons" (30 percent).
Delhi topped the list for most rapes reported among 19 cities with populations more than two million in 2016 – 1,996, or five every day, IndiaSpend reported. The city also ranked first in terms of crime rate (26.3 cases per 100,000 women) for rape, against the national average of 9.1.
Conviction rate for crime against women lowest in decade
At 18.9 percent, the conviction rate for crimes against women in 2016, as we said, was the lowest in since 2007. West Bengal, which registered the second most number of crimes in 2016, reported the lowest conviction rate (3.3 percent).
Mizoram reported the highest conviction rate (88.8 percent) in 2016, followed by Meghalaya (67.7 percent), Puducherry (62.5 percent), Uttar Pradesh (52.6 percent) and Uttarakhand (46.2 percent). In 2016, one in four rape cases in India ended in conviction–the lowest since 2012, IndiaSpend reported on 28 August, 2017.
"Greater reporting and a dismal conviction rate spell disaster for women," Agnes said.
"This means that with great faith in the system, victims and/or their relatives come forward to report crimes. After a rigorous criminal trial, if the accused is convicted, the victim gets a closure that they have secured justice. But when they have to withdraw or the verdict is adverse, the victim experiences a sense of failure and they are stigmatised."
Agnes said the conviction rate is low in cases of "cruelty by husband or relatives" because if the couple decides to file for divorce under mutual consent, the demand is usually that the wife should withdraw the case they have filed under section 498A (a section that deals with cruelty by husband or relatives).
"This does not mean that the case was false but they withdrew it only to bring in closure and move ahead with their life. Despite this, what we read in the media is that women file false cases despite the fact that women experience a high degree of domestic violence in marriages," they added.
What is needed, Agnes said, is victim-support programmes so that once a case is filed, the survivor gets support to face the daunting criminal legal system. "If this is done, it will not be such a lonely battle for the victim. We need a provision in law so that victim support is built into the statute. Only then can we see change as more cases get registered."

England's Lee Westwood is convinced they can match Sergio Garcia and end their lifelong wait for a Major.
With Garcia finally breaking their curse at the Masters in April, Westwood can now lay claim to the undisputed title of current best player never to have won a Major.
The 44-year-old has finished in the top three at the Majors six times.
And at last year's US Open at Oakmont, they went into the final round right in the mix for glory, only to shoot a painful 80 while playing partner Dustin Johnson went on to end their own wait for that elusive first Major.
This week Westwood would love to follow the example of both DJ and their European Ryder Cup team-mate Garcia.

And they claimed: “They don't give me any more encouragement – because I've always believed I can win a Major. It's about turning up at every ­tournament trying to be in the best shape to give myself a chance of winning.
“I had a great chance last year, obviously. I played pretty good for the first three days but didn't have such a good day on the Sunday beyond holing a ­couple of wedge shots here and there.
“That Oakmont course is one of the toughest tests in US Open golf, which only made the way DJ played in that last round even more impressive.

"It was exemplary stuff to watch. They played great and deserved to win it.”
The encouraging thing for Westwood going into Thursday's opening round in the company of Graeme McDowell and Ross Fisher is that they feel they are in even better nick than at Oakmont.
They said: “This year my game is in better shape than it was going into last year.
"I'm hitting the ball well, there's no real weaknesses. Whereas this time last year I didn't think I was playing that well going into the tournament, I feel like I'm playing better now, so I'm looking forward to getting started.”

USGA bosses have denied that player-power forced them to hack back some of the ­notoriously thick rough at Erin Hills.
“We always welcome feedback from the players," said USGA chief Mike Davis said.
"But I can assure you that their ­comments on the rough had absolutely zero effect on our decision to cut it back in places.”
One of the many mysteries swirling around Spider-Man: Homecoming is the identity of Donald Glover's character, who was announced as joining the cast exactly one year ago today. Rumors immediately started to fly that they were playing Miles Morales, the character they voice in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series, which they had been lobbying hard to play in a live-action movie. Today a summary of a new Spider-Man: Homecoming novel has been released, which reveals who Donald Glover is really playing, while also shedding new light on the beginning of this story. If you don't want to know how Spider-Man: Homecoming begins, there will be SPOILERS below, so read on at your own risk.
Reddit user "Alex_Helix" posted a detailed summary of a Spider-Man: Homecoming novelization, although it is mentioned at the very beginning that this novel only covers the first act of the movie. This Redditor didn't say much about whether or not this novel is already available for purchase or not, but it includes details that we have already seen in previous trailers, such as the ATM robbery and the scene where Peter returns home in full costume, only to find their friend Ned Leeds (Ned Leeds) in their room waiting for him. There are plenty of new details, though, including a description of the scene where Donald Glover's character Alex is introduced.
If this description is accurate, then Donald Glover's Alex is a local criminal who meets up with both of the Shocker characters, Herman Schultz (Bokeem Woodbine) and Jackson "Montana" Brice (Logan Marshall-Green), to buy Chitauri weapons from them. However, Spider-Man breaks up the sale, with Schultz subduing Peter with their Shocker gauntlets, allowing them to flee in a van, with Spidey giving chase, leaving Alex behind. This character doesn't surface in the rest of the novel, but since this book only covers the movie's first act, it's possible that they may surface again. It isn't clear in this description if the Chitauri weapon was left behind after Spider-Man surfaced, so perhaps Alex was able to get away with a free Chitauri weapon?
This novelization summary also includes a number of other interesting details, including that, the day after Ned Leeds found out Peter Parker is Spider-Man, Ned overhears Liz Allan (Laura Harrier) and Betty Brandt (Angourie Rice) talking about how attractive Spider-Man is. Ned then "blurts out" that Peter knows Spider-Man, through their new "internship" at Stark Industries, which has forced them to quit the academic decathlon team that Ned, Liz, Betty and Peter's rival Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori) are all on. Flash then challenges Peter to prove that they know Spidey, by bringing them by Liz's party that night. The novelization mentions that Peter is changing into their Spider-Man outfit at Liz's party when they see an explosion, which leads into the scene with Alex. There was a brief shot at the end of a recent Spider-Man: Homecoming sneak peek where Spidey is seen swinging into a backyard and skimming over a pool, in what looked to be a party scene, so it's possible that could have been Liz's party.
This summary also confirms that the Tony Stark-created Damage Control is what puts Adrian Toomes' clean-up company out of business, and that Toomes convinces their men Schultz and Brice not to surrender the Chitauri weapons they found at the Battle of New York in The Avengers, because they have new plans for these alien artifacts. The novelization also confirms that the students' trip to Washington D.C. was for the academic decathlon nationals, with Peter re-joining the team so they can also track Herman Schultz's whereabouts. With Spider-Man: Homecoming opening on July 7, hopefully we'll have more details about Donald Glover's Alex and the rest of these characters soon.
Earlier this week, Belgian police thwarted a terrorist attack in Europe that targeted a “Free Iran” rally attended by former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and many other critics of the Iranian dictatorship.
The Islamic Republic of Iran — the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism — is accused of orchestrating the plot from their diplomatic outpost in Vienna.
Reuters reported that Belgian police arrested two Iranian suspects — a husband and wife, both citizens of Belgium — who were in possession of explosives and allegedly heading to an international conference in Paris to carry out their attack.
Their plan was intercepted, and they were charged with “attempted terrorist assassination” and “preparation of a terrorist offence,” according to a statement from the Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office.
An Iranian diplomat stationed at the Austrian Embassy in Vienna was also arrested in connection with this terror plot. Belgian authorities described the diplomat as the couple's “contact person” — allegedly orchestrating the attack on behalf of the Iranian regime.
The terrorist plot targeted an annual international conference — which I have attended and covered several times in the past — hosted by Iranian dissidents and featuring Western dignitaries and diplomats, calling for freedom and democracy in Iran.
Included among the Western dignitaries were former prime minister Stephen Harper, former Foreign Affairs minister John Baird, former mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani, former Republican U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former Democratic governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson
Other Western dignitaries included a former head of the FBI, former U.S. attorney general, two former French foreign ministers, a former Italian foreign ministers, dozens of current parliamentarians and journalists from all over the world.
“The intended bombing of the rally once again shows the Iranian regime's terrorist nature, but also its desperation,” read a statement by Iranian dissidents who host the annual Free Iran conference. “Tehran cannot stop a growing resistance to its rule without committing murder and resorting to brutal suppression.”
The annual event is hosted by the National Council of Resistance Iran (NCRI), a political group opposing the Islamic Republic that is exiled in France. They call for freedom and democracy in Iran and are affiliated with the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK).
Both the NCRI and MEK are banned in Tehran — the latter considered a terrorist organization by the Iranian regime.
The MEK have a history of using violence to undermine the Iranian dictatorship, and were once listed by Western countries as a terrorist group. After years of court battles, however, multiple courts in the U.S. and Europe have ordered the removal of MEK as a designated terrorist group, stating there is no evidence of terrorism.
Many Western politicians now support the group's opposition to the increasingly belligerent theocratic dictatorship in Iran.
The Islamic Republic of Iran has a history of assassinating leaders of opposition groups who live abroad, as well as using diplomats and embassies to do the regime's dirty work, including spying and pushing regime propaganda. Canada shut down its Iranian embassy in 2012 and expelled all diplomats from this country — a move Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to reverse.
It remains unclear whether the latest thwarted terrorist attack was aimed at any one person or the conference attendees generally.
“Proud to stand up for freedom and democracy for the people of Iran,” said Harper on Twitter, following their speech at the conference.
“While the Iranian regime poses a threat to us all, the most oppressed are its own citizens. Freedom, dignity and self-determination are universal values.”
The Baltimore Ride selected midfielder Zoe Stukenberg and attacker Caroline Wannen, while the Long Island Sound picked defender Nadine Hadnagy. After they finish their final season at Maryland, the players will have the opportunity to play in the first professional women's lacrosse league in the U.S.

An outright brawl broke out between the manager of a Steve Madden store and a Swiss shopper inside a mall in Sunrise, Fla., on Wednesday.
Amazingly, and yet not surprisingly, it was caught on video.
The drama started when the employee at Sawgrass Mills Mall told the would-be customer the store was closed at 5:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.
A tad early for businesses who want to make money?
Clearly, but that's beside the point. The hours are what they are, which most people would begrudgingly accept and move on with their lives.
This woman is not most people, quite clearly.
At first, a male staff member blocked the blonde tourist from various attempts to enter the store, which they were oddly determined to do.
Repeatedly, they told the disgruntled woman no, they couldn't shop there today, and to back away from the door that was closed for the day.
Local radio DJ Andy Slater captured the chaos that followed on their phone, as they refused to take no for an answer and all hell broke loose.
When the Steve Madden store's manager came over to settle the altercation, they were promptly greeted with some bottled water to the face.
As onlookers gasped, the manager responded with a shot to …read more

INDYCAR will take the next step in the evolution of its driver safety program by testing a windscreen on an Indy car for the first time on track, Thursday, Feb. 8, at ISM Raceway. The test will be held in conjunction with the Verizon IndyCar Series' preseason open test near Phoenix.
The windscreen, under development for nearly two years, will be affixed to a Chip Ganassi Racing Honda driven by four-time Verizon IndyCar Series champion Scott Dixon. Primary goal of the test will be to validate visual acuity for the driver in various lighting conditions _ under full-sun, at dusk and at night under track lighting.
Testing will take place on the day set aside for rookie oval testing (3-7 p.m. ET). Dixon is expected to turn their first laps in the late afternoon. All series cars will test Feb. 9-10.
“This has been a long process, one that's been very methodical and purposeful,” said Jay Frye, INDYCAR president of competition and operations. “We have been striving to create a safety piece that aesthetically looks good and works in all conditions, and this is a test of those things. Any piece we put on an Indy car must work for multiple types of venues and different lighting conditions. It has to be versatile.”
The windscreen is made of a proprietary Opticor advanced transparency material by PPG, the same material the company uses in its production of fighter jet canopies. The material has shown to be stronger, lighter and more impact-resistant than polycarbonate previously used, according to Jeff Horton, INDYCAR's director of engineering and safety, who has spearheaded windscreen development with Dr. Terry Trammell, INDYCAR medical consultant.
The prototype windscreen has been tested in a scale-model wind tunnel and racing simulator at Dallara, INDYCAR's chassis producer. Harding Racing's Gabby Chaves provided driver feedback after testing in the Dallara driving simulator last year. The on-track test at ISM Raceway is the next step in its evolution, though Frye said there is no timetable for implementation into Verizon IndyCar Series competition.
“We've tested this at Dallara's simulator, but this will be the first time it has been on a car at speed,” Frye said. “So, this is just the next step in the process.”
Israeli author David Grossman won the Man Booker International Prize on Wednesday, 14 June 2017, for their novel A Horse Walks Into a Bar. They will share the £50,000 ($64,000) award with translator Jessica Cohen.
Grossman is the first Israeli writer to win the prize.
The book unfolds over the course of a stand-up show during which comedian Dovelah Gee exposes a wound they have been living with for years and the difficult choice they had to make between the two people who were dearest to him.
“Thank you all. I will cherish this award and this evening,” Grossman said after receiving the prize at a ceremony in central London.
“I thank first of all my wonderful, devoted, translator Jessica Cohen,” the 63-year-old author said.
Judge Nick Barley said Grossman “attempted an ambitious high-wire act of a novel, and... pulled it off spectacularly”. “We were bowled over by Grossman's willingness to take emotional as well as stylistic risks: every sentence counts, every word matters in this supreme example of the writer's craft,” Barley added.
Since they started writing in the late 1970s after being fired from public radio following anger over their critical coverage, Grossman has won numerous Israeli and international awards.
Their 1986 novel See Under: Love is seen by a number of critics as their masterpiece, delving into the Holocaust and the generation of Jews that followed.
Other works have included The Yellow Wind, a prescient, non-fiction look at Israel's occupation ahead of the first Palestinian intifada that erupted in 1987. Their 2008 novel To the End of the Land, published after the death of their son Uri, contemplates the effects of war while portraying Israeli life.
Grossman's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and they were also decorated with France's Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1998.
In 2011 they were part of a group of seven prominent writers from around the world to appeal to the United Nations Security Council to sanction the Syrian government over its actions in the civil war which began that year.
The international edition of Britain's Man Booker Prize was introduced in 2005 and up to last year, was awarded in recognition of a body of work by a living author whose work was written or available in English. From 2016, the prize has been given for a single work of fiction that has been translated into English and published in Britain.
The prize was won last year by South Korean author Han Kang for The Vegetarian, which sold 1,60,000 copies in the UK according to the prize organisers.
The Argos and Eskimos completed a trade Monday, the kind of trade where no immediate winner or loser can be discerned, one of those patented risk/reward deals that only time will judge.
This isn't the blockbuster that shook the CFL world in 2012 when Ricky Ray came to Toronto from Edmonton, but at the same it can have an impact if the Argos can ink James Franklin to a new deal.
Franklin, who played in the shadow of Mike Reilly, the CFL's reigning MOP, is a very intriguing prospect with all the tools required to be the face of a franchise.
They have a big arm, there's mobility and an ability to move the pocket and make plays on the run. He's a leader.
There are some in the CFL who believe Franklin wants to take a shot down south, others who insist he'll become a starting quarterback in three-down football given the need at the position and the uncertainty among several teams.
What the Argos did was basically given themselves an exclusive negotiating window to sign Franklin, who can go wherever they want and play for whomever once CFL free agency kicks in Feb. 13 at high noon.
In exchange, Edmonton received Canadian offensive lineman Mason Woods, Toronto's first selection in the 2017 draft who never appeared in a game as a rookie.
Franklin is a marquee name and one of the big fish in the CFL free-agent pool. They aren't going to go back to Edmonton and now the Argos have to convince them to play in Toronto.
Ray's decision to play or retire had no bearing on the Franklin deal, according to Argos GM Jim Popp.
“This had nothing to do with Ricky,'' Popp said of Monday's announcement. “This is just an opportunity that arose for us to be able to land a player like this.”
As of Monday, Popp hadn't heard from Ray.
Popp has spoken with Franklin and head coach Marc Trestman was planning, if they hadn't already, to talk with Franklin.
System wise, Franklin will know the language and the nuances given how Jason Mass, Edmonton's head coach, took elements of the Trestman offence when Mass served as an assistant in Toronto under head coach Scott Milanovich, who served under Trestman in Montreal.
Trestman knows quarterbacks and their ability to teach players and nurture them has made the Argos a destination point.
“For us it was a good deal,'' Popp said during a phone interview. “How it all materializes, we'll see in the future.”
There has been interested in Woods from Edmonton for months, sparking some discussions.
Talks were put off, but they resumed last week.
“All of a sudden they picked up again,'' added Popp, who also received Edmonton's third-round selection in next year's draft.
Franklin is not under contract and they may decide to exercise free agency.
“That's the risk,'' admitted Popp. “Toronto is a destination he's very interested in being where the future and having an opportunity looks bright.”
At first glance, Franklin makes a good fit for the Argos, whether Ray decides to continue their career or not.
The remaining question is whether Franklin and the club can strike a deal and at what term.
Around the league, there's a sense Franklin would prefer a one-year deal.
“We've already made the call since we got their rights,'' Popp said of negotiations with Franklin's representative. “From our end, we want to know what's going to happen here, what the chances are, what's going to take place. We're moving fast, we're moving probably a little too fast for them.”
Franklin recently changed agents, but from an Argos perspective you can see the need to expedite matters.
Everyone knew the CFL off-season would be interesting and the Franklin deal added to the interest.
Whether a team has won a Grey Cup or finished last, teams are always looking to acquire pieces that foster a competitive camp.
“And James fits that,'' said Popp. “He's a tremendous young man (Franklin is 26). They have a lot of tools to work with. They didn't play much last year, but when they have played they have shown great promise.”
Like any player, the Argos won't know what they have in Franklin, if they actually get him, until they see them in person and begin to work with the player.
In the end, the Argos might not get their hands on Franklin.
The Argos may even hear from Ray that they have nothing to give and will retire as a Grey Cup champion, their fourth in their hall of fame career.
“This is where the risk comes in,'' Popp said of trading for Franklin. “You take a little risk some time. Toronto is a destination he's interested in playing.”
ARGOS ‘VALUED' WOODS
Years from now, Mason Woods might be best known as the player the Argos traded to get their hands on James Franklin, who, by all accounts, is a certain starting quarterback, the kind of person to serve as the face of a franchise.
For now, Woods is an unknown, a very good person who spent their rookie season in Toronto learning the game and what it is required to be a pro.
He's a good kid with a towering presence and Woods is now with the Edmonton Eskimos.
If Woods can get stronger and meaner, he'll be an incumbent on the offensive line.
He's a Canadian kid who played their NCAA football at Idaho.
As soon as the Argos used their first pick in this year's draft (10th overall), the Eskimos showed interest.
“We valued Mason Woods,'' said Argos GM Jim Popp. “He's a national and we developed them for a season. They got bigger and stronger and we expect them to play a lot of football in the CFL.
“If we were going to give them up, we wanted something major back.”
The Eskimos get a tangible piece in Woods, who has yet to take a single rep during a game.
The Argos get a pending free agent in Franklin and a third-round pick in the 2018 draft.
NORRISTOWN, Pa. — ​Disgraced comedian Bill Cosby smiled Tuesday during prosecutor's closings in their sex assault case, invoking the wrath of a plucky prosecutor who noticed the smirk.
“He's laughing like it's funny,” Montgomery County prosecutor Kristen Feden ​said, gesturing to Cosby as their grin slipped from their face. “There's nothing funny about stripping a woman of their capacity to consent.
“There's nothing funny about that, Mr. Cosby,” Feden bellowed at the 80-year-old as they sunk into their chair.
The ​former pudding pitchman's ill-timed expression came after the assistant DA told jurors Cosby repeatedly manipulated their role as “America's Dad” to gain the trust of unsuspecting women in order to drug and sexually assault them.
“This man is nothing like the image they played on TV,” Feden ​yelled as they stomped across the well to stand inches from​ a terrified-looking ​Cosby. “He is nothing like ‘America's Dad.'”
Feden continued to s​hout as their extended finger hovered in front of Cosby's face. The legally blind actor sat rigidly in their chair, eyes glassy and bugging, as they called them a “con” who used their award-winning role as Dr. Cliff Huxtable to “gain the confidences of these young, aspiring, trusting women so they could sexually assault them.”
Former Temple University staffer Andrea Constand, who has accused Cosby of drugging and molesting them in January 2004, sat listening in the front row of the gallery.
Some 60 women have accused Cosby of drug-facilitated sexual assault, though Constand's case is the only one that has resulted in criminal charges.
“This was no mistake,” Feden proclaimed Tuesday of the accused assault. “This was the execution of their signature plan. That previously perfected plan that had worked so well on women in the past.”
Constand took the stand during Cosby's retrial to tell jurors Cosby offered them “three friends” inside their suburban Philadelphia home to combat stress. They then lost control of their body and they began to prey on her, they said.
“The only person who knows what they gave them that day was him,” Feden said, again pointing at Cosby. The TV pioneer claims it is was Benadryl and that the encounter was consensual.
see also Cosby's lawyers plead with jury to acquit "You're about to make one of the most important decisions...
“[Constand] didn't ingest those pills so the defendant could position them on their couch, wait for them to pass out, and then position themselves behind them and force their fingers into their vagina repeatedly,” Feden said.
Heidi Thomas, Chelan Lasha, Janice Baker-Kinney, Janice Dickinson and Maud Lise-Lotte Lublin also took the stand during the 12-day trial to allege that Cosby had drugged and sexually assaulted them.
During their arguments, Feden broke down elements common to the six alleged encounters, which they said “show how well practiced and how well executed [Cosby's] con was.”
Cosby frequently ingratiated themselves into their alleged victim's families, jurors heard at trial. Though he'd known Constand for months, the other women they sought out through friends or modeling agencies, Feden said. They then offered them drugs — for a cold, for menstrual cramps, for partying — or alcohol, and proceeded to attack them, the accusers testified.
Feden also personally attacked defense attorney Kathleen Bliss for their “filthy” characterizations of Cosby's accusers during the defense closings.
“She's the exact reason why women and victims of sexual assault don't report those crimes,” Feden said scathingly, elevating the pitch of their voice to mock Bliss.
“Well, you know Mr. Cosby was married,” Feden parroted Bliss, before returning to their own tone. “Women are not responsible for both their own sexuality and the sexuality of men.”
Cosby faces three charges of aggravated indecent assault for the alleged incident. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars on each count.
Seven in 10 employees lack the awareness to stop preventable cybersecurity incidents, according to the second-annual State of Privacy and Security Awareness Report.
For the second year in a row, the average survey respondent achieved a "Novice" score, showing the average survey respondent is dangerously close to one wrong decision or mistake leading to a security or privacy incident.
Last year'sState of Privacy and Security Awareness Report found that nearly nine in 10 employees lacked awareness to stop preventable cyberthreats. While 2017's report has shown improvement, the numbers still reflect the concerted effort needed to increase employee awareness.
"With overwhelming data supporting the fact that employees are the weakest link in privacy and security, companies can't rely on haphazard, annual training to solve the problem," said Steve Conrad, MediaPro's founder and managing director. "Instead, they've got to look to make continuous improvements in cybersecurity knowledge and behavior. We're pleased to see a general improvement in security and privacy awareness this year, but we have our work cut out for us moving forward."
According to the report:
Nearly 20 percent of respondents scored low enough to warrant a "Risk" profile, up from 16 percent in 2016, by exhibiting behaviors that put their organizations at serious risk for a privacy or security incident
30 percent of respondents were given a "Hero" profile, up from 19 percent in 2016. This is encouraging, as it indicates an improved knowledge of security and privacy best practices
19 percent of respondents chose to take risky actions related to working remotely, such as connecting their work computer to an unsecured public Wi-Fi hotspot
12 percent of respondents failed to recognize common signs of malware when presented with real-life examples, such as a sluggish computer or anti-virus software unexpectedly switching off
24 percent of employees surveyed took potentially risky actions when presented with scenarios related to organizational physical security, such as letting strangers in without identification
20 percent of employees showed a lack of awareness related to safe social media posting, choosing risky actions such as posting on their personal social media accounts about a yet-to-be-released product of their employer

FORT MYERS, Fla. Medicare cards are getting a new and safer look.
Watch the video to see what's new, and the precautions when the new cards start to come out.
On March 9, 2016, the NHL announced the Pittsburgh Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers would participate in the Coors Light NHL Stadium Series. The game would be held in Pittsburgh at Heinz Field and give the hockey world the opportunity to see the “Battle of Pennsylvania” contested within some rather large confines, adding another layer to the rivalry.
The Penguins took the game 4-2, as Sidney Crosby collected the game winner, adding another “big” goal to their collection of heroics.
In honor of both franchises celebrating their 50th Anniversaries, the league announced two alumni games would be included on the scheduled list of events to coincide with Stadium Series Game. The first contest would be played on Jan. 14, 2016, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. With the second game occurring on March 18, 2017, at the Santander Arena in Reading, Pennsylvania.
The teams would draw even in the first game 3-3, with the Flyers earning an 8-6 victory in the second game.
One member of the Penguins roster was a veteran of 218 NHL games, goaltender Jean-Sebastien Aubin.
Aubin appeared in 168 games with the Penguins over six seasons from 1998-2004, compiling a record of 63-72-11, a goals-against average of 2.92, and earning six shutouts along the way. After their time with Pittsburgh, Aubin would make stops in Los Angeles, Toronto and Philadelphia before rounding out their playing career in six seasons overseas, competing in Germany, France, and Italy.
Alumni Involvement
The Hockey Writers: Can you discuss how you became involved with the Pittsburgh Penguins Alumni organization?
Jean-Sebastien Aubin: I‘ve never left Pittsburgh since I played here. We always came back in the summers, in between seasons. So I always kept in touch with the Alumni all along. When I finally retired a few years ago, after playing 6 years in Europe. I got more involved with it.
THW: Are you going to have continued involvement with the Penguins alumni organization?
JA: I will definitely keep playing any games we get involved in. I had a great time, and I‘m pretty much the only goalie available in town, so I win by default. I don't care. It's so much fun, everyone involved is a blast to be around, and all the stories are great to hear once again.
THW: Would you like to see the NHL invest more resources into Alumni initiatives?
JA: I would love if the NHL would get more involved with the alumni. I think we could do a little circuit of maybe 10 games a year, where we could travel a little and showcase our old legs. I think the fans would have a blast, as long as the lineups are legit with players that played enough to be remembered.
Return To The Ice
THW: How many William M.Jennings trophies would have an Aubin and Jocelyn Thibault tandem collected?
JA: Lol, probably zero. If we did, it would have been a tremendous team effort. Let's be honest it would have been legendary, haha.
THW: What were some of the emotions you felt during the player introductions, and through the first few minutes of the game?
JA: I didn't really think much of it since we played in Philadelphia. I definitely didn't expect any cheers, but I don't recall being booed either. So I‘m unsure if it's an insult or a good thing. As far as how it felt. Let's just say I didn't want to embarrass myself. I was a little nervous until the puck dropped, but then it all settled and felt like the usual intensity of having a good game
THW: Who do you think has more fun in these types of games: skaters or goaltenders?
JA: I think everyone has a good time, but the players probably have the most fun. Since it's not a defensive type of game goalies usually get abused lol.
THW: Given the storied history between the Penguins/Flyers, did you get a sense the game was more than an exhibition contest?
JA: The game we played in Philadelphia was definitely lots of fun. Don't get me wrong we weren't going to make it easy on them, and I think they felt the same. So, in the end, a 3-3 tie was the perfect ending for us, and I'm sure they were happy too. No one was going to give the game away, trust me that rivalry was still there just at a different level that's all lol.
THW: In alumni games, a penalty shot replaces a power play. What impact on the NHL would that rule change have?
JA: Luckily, it didn't happen when we played the 2 games we did against the flyers last year. Now if the NHL would adopt this I think a few coaches would have a heart attack every year, and goalies would definitely have gray hair faster in their life. I think the only ones that would actually enjoy this would be the fans. I'm not sure players would want that kind of responsibility for their actions.
Family and the Future
THW: What was it like to share the experience with your family?
JA: It was great for them. The whole gang came to Philly to watch the game. They had a blast until they realized Crosby wasn't there, and then the interest went down a little.
THW: Did being a participant in the alumni games, fuel a desire for a comeback?
JA: I‘m happy with being retired. I get to help young goaltenders to reach their goals and maybe their dream of playing at the highest level they can get. Being a goaltending coach for the Penguins Elite Program has been good for my transition, it helped me go through it a lot easier than if I didn't keep myself busy. I have found it to be been as rewarding as when I played.

Boys & Girls Club of Laguna Beach is thrilled to announce the receipt of a $6,000 grant from the Festival of Arts Foundation to fund its Arts-For-All program available to all members during their time after-school. The organization believes that play and art create a healthy role in the learning and development of every child, as imagination and creativity are vital components of increasing their full potential as adults. The Club's arts programming provide members with opportunities that generate ideas and enhance their ability to transform vision into a reality while navigating the world around them.
Boys & Girls Club of Laguna Beach is dedicated to providing a diverse array of art programs, in which each area serves our youth through exposure, education and enriching experiences. Not only do children have the opportunity to learn how to create art, but also experience the thrill of seeing their pieces displayed in onsite exhibits while entering their art into local and national art competitions.
Caitlin Reller, Art Director of Boys & Girls Club of Laguna Beach, is building fun and exciting activities related to all aspects of art and youth development, all thanks to the assistance of funding from the Festival of Art Foundation. As an example, during the recent Laguna Beach Unified School District's Ski Week, Ms. Reller organized a field trip to Crystal Cove with 18 members. In collaboration with the Crystal Cove Conservancy Club, members took a tour of the park and participated in a Plein Air watercolor activity and a photographic scavenger hunt. The resulting art from these activities is on display at the Crystal Cove Gallery during Crystal Cove's Art in the Park festival. The opening of the art exhibit is March 31 and members' pieces will be on display for the duration of April. The Club invites the entire community to come and view the artistic talents of the participants.
The Art of Healing event on March 28 at the Boys & Girls Club of Laguna Beach, Canyon Branch, from 5 to 7 pm is yet another exciting event that the Festival of Arts Foundation is helping make possible. The event will be a collaborative experience where parents and children have the opportunity to come together and create art as a shared, joyful experience. Activities will include visual art, the art of cooking, creating essential oils for healing and much, much more. The Club invites the entire community to this special event.
Without the continuing support of the Festival of Arts Foundation, these wonderful opportunities for families within the community would not be possible. For more information about the activities, please contact Michelle Ray Fortezzo at (949) 494-2535 ext. 7584 or micheller@bgclaguna.org or visit the Club website at www.bgclagunabeach.org.

Kai Johns devoted part of their working life to service in the United States military. But when they visited medics with suspected flu, doctors found themselves in a battle against the clock.
Veteran Johns was born with a condition known as polycystic kidney disease (PKD). They were not the first in their family to be blighted by the illness. In fact, it had also affected the three generations before him. But despite this, Johns managed to live a life more interesting than most.

Johns lived an active lifestyle and enjoyed diving. One of their recent adventures involved an underwater adventure in Honduras in the fall of 2016. However, a love for sub-aqua antics wasn't their only passion. They had also devoted a period in their life to patriotic duties.

Exercise gadget integration hasn't exactly been elegant in the past. It's been half a decade since Apple transitioned to the lighting connector, and still I regularly see the long-retired iPod 30-pin cable flopping off treadmill dashboards at gyms all around the country. It's impossible to say how any of this will look five years from now, but at the very least, Apple's new GymKit offering is certainly more refined than most of what's come before it.
Unveiled at WWDC over the summer, the platform is designed to make wearing an Apple Watch a more seamless experience. It uses a combination of NFC and Bluetooth to maintain a constant exchange of information between the two devices. The watch is better at collecting some data (calories, heart rate) and the equipment is better at others (distance, incline). All of that data is displayed on the watch and the machine's display in real time, and aggregated in Apple's Health app.
The feature has already launched in five gyms in Australia and a couple in the U.K. It launches here in the U.S. this week, at the Life Time athletic club in Manhattan, with more spots like Equinox getting their hands on GymKit-enabled equipment in the near future. It's a bit of a slow roll out, given the relative expense of replacing gym equipment, but it should speed up fairly quickly, as a number of equipment makers have signed on to Apple's platform.
The company says it's got about 80 percent of the gym fitness markets hare covered, starting with Italian manufacturer TechnoGym, which is going to start adding the functionality to every treadmill it makes from here on out. Other pieces of equipment will follow, including step machines and stationary bikes. Apple's also exploring partnerships with manufacturers of home equipment.
I got a demo of the equipment here in the city earlier today, and it all operates as smoothly as you'd hope. You hold the watch up to a designated point on the machine, and it pairs via NFC — basically the same experience as buying something with Apple Pay. And it's compatible with all models of Apple Watch.
The intentional pairing process is important so the machine doesn't just automatically pull data from your device. After all, the Health app stores potentially sensitive information like weight and age, which you might not want to share with a strange piece of exercise equipment. From there, the process is basically a couple of taps.
As a regular treadmill runner, I'm looking forward to the feature rolling out more widely. Apple's done a pretty decent job calculating things like pace and distance without the use of GPS, but fitness machines offer an even more accurate reading. They also do a better job with things like flights climbed and inclined. That said, they suck at heart rate and things like calories burned, because they don't have your vitals (height, weight, etc.), unless you plug in that information. GymKit is an attempt to combine the best data sets from both devices.
Equipment manufacturers seem eager to embrace the tech in an attempt to offer up the latest and greatest to gyms. How long it will actually take to circulate is another question entirely. Those pricey sports clubs will likely be the first to get it, and others will probably wait until the end of life on their current devices. Apparently the upgrade cycle is around five years for these professional pieces of sports equipment — though I'm pretty sure I regularly encounter ones from the height of Jazzercise in hotel fitness rooms.
That said, some companies are offering up a retrofitting service. Depending on the specific manufacturer, that could be as simple as inserting a new chip into the back of the machine. For others, it will require replacing the top console altogether. That's also good news for future upgrades, meaning the days of dangling connectors might soon be behind us.

(Reuters) - Radiant Life Care Private Ltd revised its offer for India's Fortis Healthcare Ltd (FOHE.NS) on Tuesday, proposing to buy one of its hospitals in Mumbai immediately, as a five-way takeover battle for the hospital chain intensifies.

Radiant made a binding offer to purchase Fortis Mulund Hospital at an enterprise value of 12 billion rupees ($181 million), Fortis said in a filing that included Radiant's offer letter.
The deal will provide immediate liquidity of 6.8 billion rupees for Fortis with no equity dilution for shareholders, Radiant said in the letter.
Radiant, which is backed by private equity firm KKR, made its offer last week to buy more than a quarter of the cash-strapped company's hospital business.
Earlier on Tuesday, Malaysia's IHH Healthcare Bhd (IHHH.KL) revised its proposal for Fortis, making a binding proposal for about a fifth of its offer value.
The group's revised offer proposes an immediate infusion of 6.50 billion rupees.
IHH plans to infuse the amount via a preferential issue and allotment of shares at 160 rupees per share for which it would be given the right to appoint two directors to Fortis' board, IHH said bit.ly/2Hpal2Y.
The non-binding part of the proposal is for subsequent infusion of up to 33.50 billion rupees.
Earlier this month, IHH, one of Asia's largest healthcare operators, said it was ready to infuse 40 billion rupees at up to 160 rupees per share.
Fortis, which confirmed the receipt of IHH's revised offer, has received as many as five offers for control of its hospital business. Rival hospital operator Manipal Healthcare Enterprises Pvt Ltd and a consortium of two prominent Indian business families have submitted a binding bid and an investment offer, respectively.
China's Fosun International (0656.HK) and Radiant are the other suitors.
I remember the earliest days of the internet. In those days, if you didn't phrase your search terms just right, you couldn't find anything worthwhile.
Things haven't changed all that much.
When I started this blog for Memorial Day, I asked Google, “Are we still losing 22 veterans a day?” Google very quickly informed me that Beyonce lost 15 pounds on their 22-day diet. When did our priorities rank weight loss or celebrities above suicide?
Digging around I found a variety of articles – some of them affirm 22 a day continues and some of which dispute that the methodology used in attaining those numbers is precise.
Suffice to say, one would be too many, but the numbers remain staggeringly high.
According to the Department of Veterans Affairs' most recent report, veterans are 20 percent more likely to complete suicide than non-veterans. It's especially disturbing to note that the suicide rate for female veterans is 250 percent that for female non-vets.
Rates of suicide are highest in veterans age 18-29 and amongst those who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn.
I marvel at those names. We seem to be interested in freeing a lot of folks, unless they're veterans who live in the hell of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, alcoholism or addiction to opioids (all of which remain at staggeringly high rates and a high percentage of vets live with both PTSD and addictions).
Memorial Day is for honoring those who died in active military service. That we allow veterans to die by the thousands every year from the results of war after coming home is unconscionable.
Memorial Day and every day, I thank all veterans for their service. I also ask that all who care about them demand that our government provide immediate access to the very best medical and psychiatric care available.
As Mother Jones said, “Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living.”
Let's face it: Even with the modern conveniences of U-Hauls and cardboard boxes, moving is a pain. For Neolithic humans living in Europe 5,000 years ago, the obstacles—roaming predators, lack of transportation, unforgiving—must have seemed insurmountable. “Deep in the past, a few humans could have moved hundreds of kilometers, certainly, but most people at that time would not have,” says Chris Tyler-Smith, a human genetics researcher at England's Sanger Institute.
New research based on a novel mapping technique, however, suggests otherwise. By combining genetic data with archaeology, researchers analyzed the DNA of over 300 ancient Eurasians and Near-Eastern Europeans to find that these people may have roamed surprisingly far. They found that 50 percent of ancient skeletons were in graves more than 100 miles from their place of origin, 30 percent were up to 620 miles away, and the remaining people had roamed as far as 1,900 miles from their homes.
“This is the first time anyone has ever been able to do anything like this,” says Eran Elhaik, one of the pioneers of the new technique and a geneticist at the University of Sheffield. “We were able to see the emergence of farming, and populations moving because they exhausted the land, and then irrigation systems. As the populations moved, they replaced all the hunter-gatherers.” Elhaik and their team presented their preliminary findings last month at the European Society of Human Genetics Conference.
Archaeologists and geneticists alike have speculated about how and where humans migrated across Europe. Based on skeletal remains, they believe Europe was populated by modern humans around 45,000 years ago as hominins moved out of Africa and into other parts of the world. Europe was then largely depopulated when the most recent ice age took hold around 25,000 years ago, except for some stalwart holdouts who found survivable conditions in southern Europe.
“Archaeologists have long hypothesized that Europe was colonized by successive waves of hunter-gatherers, based on clear differences in stone tools and bone and shell ornaments recovered from sites across Europe and the Middle East,” writes Ewen Callaway for Nature.
But it's only recently that archaeologists have been able to compare their material data to the story that genetics tells. With recent advances in analyzing ancient DNA, we're beginning to get a much clearer—and more complex—picture about these humans and their lives.
…
DNA is notoriously delicate. It can only survive intact under certain environmental conditions, and prefers cold places. In human samples, the best place to find it from is the petrous bone on the skull, near the ear. But even once you've gotten your hands on some usable DNA, mining it for useful information comes with a series of hurdles.
Extracting ancient DNA and sequencing it with next-generation techniques results in a hodgepodge of information. The DNA isn't just from the ancient human—it's also from the surrounding environment, and maybe from contamination introduced by modern researchers. To sort through this tangle, researchers rely on computer assistance to identify a single mitochondrial DNA sequence (the presence of more than one indicates contamination) and pick out deterioration patterns that signal human DNA.
But once those snippets of human DNA have been plucked from the mess, they can open up a world of discoveries. We can learn about everything from what ancient humans like Ötzi the ice mummy ate and wore, to how often Neanderthals and humans were procreating. “I think it's one of the most exciting developments in science in the last few decades,” says Tyler-Smith. “People have compared it to the development of radiocarbon dating in the middle of the 20th century in terms of its impact.”
Elhaik has expanded on the information that can be extracted from ancient DNA using a technique they pioneered with living humans, called Geographic Population Structure, or GPS. This technique relies on datasets that compare single nucleotide polymorphisms—differences in DNA nucleotides that act as biological markers among individuals. The GPS method uses the SNPs (pronounced “snips”) of populations that have been in one place for multiple generations, then contrasts it to groups that live farther away.
“We didn't just hack a cool acronym, it really works like GPS navigation,” Elhaik says. “Instead of satellites we're using populations that are very well localized to their regions.”
In a 2014 study in Nature Communications, Elhaik and their colleagues applied the GPS method to more than 600 people around the world, and were able to correctly assign 83 percent of those individuals to their country of origin. When the same technique was applied to 200 Sardinian villagers, a quarter of them were placed in their villages and the majority of people were placed within 50 km of their homes.
The same technique is at play in their new research. “We used ancient DNA extracted from skeleton remains from 12000 BC to 500 AD," says Elhaik. "The DNA goes in and coordinates come out”—though they add that the sample size is far smaller for ancient individuals, so there are far more gaps across the continent. Think of it as GPS for the long-dead.
“If you have perhaps 20 or 30 people who come from the same population, then there's extra information you can get,” says Tyler-Smith, who is not involved in the GPS research. But, they add, “bigger numbers are always better.”
…
But geneticists and archaeologists don't always agree on the finer points of prehistory. For Marc Vander Linden, a professor of archaeology at University College London, using such small sample sizes to draw large conclusions is problematic.
“Geneticists have suggested wide-scale processes on the basis of limited, spatially clustered samples, and then—wrongly—generalized these results for the entire corresponding archaeological cultures,” Linden said by email. “Both archaeologists and geneticists need to fully realize and consider that genes and material culture do not operate in the same spheres of action, nor do they unfold upon the same spatial and temporal scales.”
Linden does agree that geneticists' work in ancient DNA has revolutionized the field and opened up new avenues of inquiry. “Ancient DNA research, alongside other types of data, points to the fact that the population history of prehistoric Europe was in constant flux and marked by numerous episodes of both expansion and retraction.”
If Elhaik's technique pans out, it could answer tantalizing questions about human migration—for instance, how agriculture came to the region. Archaeologists have debated for decades whether it was transmitted by human migration, or by the movement of the idea itself. Part of the debate has recently been settled by genetics, with researchers seeing the movement of agricultural communities from the Near-East into the hunter-gatherer groups in Europe. Elhaik thinks their group's research will further elucidate that question and show more precise movements of multiple groups of people.
For Tyler-Smith, that type of increased resolution into the broad outlines of the past is the future of the field. He'd also like to see more samples from other parts of the world—the hotter, dryer regions like Africa and southern Europe where it's been harder to find ancient DNA still intact due to the environmental conditions. For now, though, unraveling European migration is itself helping us make sense of human ancestry—and the fact that we're all mutts.
“There's no such thing as a European population that's been around for 40,000 years,” Tyler-Smith says. “Mixing has been going on throughout prehistory and I think we will see that in every part of the world as we come to study it in this level of detail.”
(Bloomberg Markets)—Real estate fund managers Michael Episcope and David Scherer had Georgia on their minds—specifically, Atlanta. The city, part of the third-largest-gaining metro area in the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data, was only getting hotter. So when the co-founders of real estate investment company Origin Investments spotted an opportunity last year to purchase a 125-unit apartment complex, they jumped on it. The property's location, in Virginia-Highland, an affluent Atlanta neighborhood that's home to organic shops, cocktail bars, and an indie film theater, was great. Yet Episcope and Scherer had a problem. They reckoned it would take about $19 million in equity to buy the building and an adjacent undeveloped lot, but they wanted to invest only $12 million. Their solution was somewhat novel: Instead of bringing in a partner, Origin brought in dozens of them.
Origin emailed hundreds of investors with an offer to invest in the complex. Twenty-four hours later, the Chicago-based company had raised an additional $6.6 million from 39 investors and had 23 more takers on the waiting list.
“It was spoken for very quickly,” Episcope says. “We came in the next day and had to send out an email and say, ‘We're filled up because the number of inquiries is more than we could satisfy.'”
Episcope and Scherer founded Origin in 2007 to invest their own money in office buildings and apartment developments in secondary U.S. cities, areas other than inflated markets such as New York and San Francisco. By the time the partners closed a $151 million fund raised from 450 investors last June, they'd transformed the company into something different: a real estate private equity fund that uses crowdfunding-like tactics to raise money from family offices and high-net-worth individuals.
That business model relies on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, updated in 2013, that govern the way investment firms can raise money online. A rule known as 506(c), introduced following the JOBS Act, lifted the ban on “general solicitation.” Investment firms became free to market offerings to accredited investors, who are typically worth more than $1 million, through advertisements or blast emails. Real estate fund managers have used the go-ahead to solicit a wide array of these investors for funding hotels and warehouses from Florida to Wisconsin.
The model sounds a little like crowdfunding, though that term has become more associated with adventurous young entrepreneurs pooling relatively small amounts of money from average Joes over the internet. The JOBS Act let startups and investment firms sell equity stakes to nonaccredited investors. That's not what's happening here. What these real estate fund managers have been doing might be called crowdfunding for the wealthy.
As Episcope puts it, the rule changes have made raising funds a lot easier. In the early days of Origin, they say, “it was my partner and I, knocking on doors and meeting with people and stretching our network as far as we could.” Their reach has now significantly increased. “If you have a great product and you put it in front of millions of people, they're going to buy it.”
Companies such as Origin see a fertile market in the world of family offices, which on average allocate 16.2 percent of their portfolios to direct real estate investments, according to a 2017 report by UBS Group AG and researcher Campden Wealth Ltd. While the biggest family offices can afford to buy properties on their own, Episcope says their model has the potential to bring higher-quality deals to smaller investors.
“Origin has always been designed around providing the individual investor with the same opportunities, service, and fee structure that the multibillion-dollar investors enjoy,” they say. “We believe there is still a large gap.”
Origin has followed a two-pronged plan. It has hired experienced professionals to buy and manage undervalued real estate, targeting net returns of about 15 percent, similar to a large private equity fund focused on real estate but with lower fees than what noninstitutional investors normally pay. At the same time, Origin built a technology platform that gives investors real-time information on how their investments are faring and doubles as a tool for marketing to new investors.
Driftwood Acquisitions & Development LP, a Miami-based hotel owner, took a different path to a similar strategy, says Carlos Rodriguez Jr., the chief operating officer. During the recession, the company saw cheaply priced hotels it wanted to acquire, but found that institutional partners it had relied on when the economy was growing had less appetite for risk during the downturn. Rodriguez and their father, Driftwood Chief Executive Officer Carlos Rodriguez Sr., raised $50 million in equity, mostly from previous investors, to fund acquisitions, then set to work formalizing a network of accredited investors interested in buying into Driftwood's deals after an acquisition had closed.
It's a traditional syndication strategy with a twist. Driftwood buys hotels with its own capital, then uses its own website to solicit investors to co-invest a minimum of $100,000. That type of marketing was forbidden before the JOBS Act. The company's website says investors can expect an internal rate of return exceeding 15 percent.
Driftwood was expanding its model in 2013 around the time the SEC was lifting its ban on solicitation. Driftwood began advertising the past performance of its hotel deals on its website and sending blast emails whenever it had a deal to syndicate. What started as a plan to communicate with existing business partners turned into an invitation to investors to come in off the street and get to know the company. That was the case last year when Driftwood bought the Tan-Tar-A Resort in Lake of the Ozarks, Mo., and announced plans to convert the property into a Margaritaville hotel. Local media coverage of the project led new investors to reach out to the company, though none ponied up the $100,000 minimum investment Driftwood was seeking.
Still, the younger Rodriguez says using crowdfunding-style models will expand Driftwood's investor base. “How do we leverage what we know is a good model and what is already set up for accredited investor crowdfunding and really scale it?” they say. “We're trying to ramp it up.”
Part of the challenge for Driftwood and other companies vying for family office allocations is distinguishing themselves from the masses of crowdfunding platforms that have sprung up over the past five years. There are now more than 100 such companies. The crowded field has made it hard for investors to know which platforms they can trust to deliver quality deals, says Richard Wilson, who represents 23 family offices and serves as CEO of the Family Office Club. “Nobody knows which will die or survive, and it feels messy,” they say.
Yet these online real estate platforms argue they're providing investors with information in a way that is anything but messy. Cadre, a real estate investment platform, gives investors access to a package of information on closed deals and current offerings, including projected returns, drone video of the property, and the company's rationale for investing in the deal.
Cadre doesn't describe its business model as crowdfunding. Currently the platform is open only to accredited investors, which include select clients such as family offices and high-net-worth individuals, and each investment is typically structured as a limited partnership. For each one, Cadre enters into a joint venture with an operating partner who invests alongside the company.
Cadre was co-founded in 2014 by Ryan Williams, a serial entrepreneur and an alumnus of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s tech, media, and telecom group and the real estate arm of Blackstone Group LP. Some of the initial investors in the company included White House adviser Jared Kushner as well as Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm led by Jared's brother, Josh Kushner.
Cadre has closed more than a dozen deals and recently landed a $250 million commitment from Goldman's private bank. The average offering size on the platform is about $30 million of equity, according to the company, with most of the properties falling in the categories of office space, multifamily homes, and retail.
Williams sees much bigger business opportunities for Cadre in the future. The company wants to open up the platform to nonaccredited investors and market to a larger base within the next couple of years, they say. The SEC regulatory changes would allow it to do that.
The company competes head-to-head with pools led by big private equity companies, but Williams is confident they can win. “This is an institutional-grade asset,” they say. “We'll beat them by being able to find deals, move faster, and pay the same price, if not a better price, because we have fewer fees due to our technology.”

What's in the cards for the new casino proposed at the Western Fair District?
Gateway Casinos laid out its plans for a $142-million development at the city's strategic priorities and policy committee meeting Monday.
The company hopes to build its “premium brand” Grand Villa casino, with a 125-room hotel, a new gaming floor, and four restaurants. It'll also bring 700 new jobs to the city, said Keith Andrews, the company's senior vice-president and managing director in Ontario.
Construction is broken down into two phases, each expected to take a year to complete.
The first phase will include building the gaming area, the food and beverage area, and the building's back of house. The second phase will construct the hotel, and a new grandstand facing the race track.

Diagrams of each phase and glamorous-looking renderings of the finished project flashed across the screen, while Andrews and two architects fielded questions from city politicians. Everyone but Councillor Josh Morgan was in attendance.
The first inquiry came from Councillor Harold Usher, who pressed on how much parking space would be needed, and what would happen during events held at the other Western Fair buildings.
Andrews was unable to provide an exact number of parking spaces but acknowledged the company would be using 12 acres of land for both its development and parking. In the future, they plan to lease space for more parking and don't intend to create a below-ground parking garage.
“We believe there's ample parking in the area,” explained Andrews. “Parking is the most crucial piece for us, in terms of a development of this scale and size.”
Ward 4 Coun. Jesse Helmer raised the issue of the “downsides of gambling,” and asked how Gateway approaches issues of addiction and connecting visitors to supports when needed.
“Staff training is a huge element of it,” said Andrews. Back in 1994 when building the province's first casino in Windsor, Andrews said they worked on the province's first responsible gaming program.
“We're an operator, and it's our obligation [from] a regulating standpoint and an operating standpoint, to make sure we have programs in place.”
The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation's executive director of Policy & Social Responsibility, Paul Pellizzari, was able to shed more light on problem gambling itself in Ontario, and the programs that'll exist at the new casino.
Over the past decade, the number of adults with medium to severe issues with problem gambling have dropped from 5.8-per cent to 1.2-per cent, they explained.
“In terms of trying to get people to understand how gambling works, and be able to make healthy choices for themselves, you're more effective… when you actually engage people,” said Pellizzari.

They teach people about the topics of randomness, or the value of taking frequent breaks, both online and inside newly dubbed “playsmart centres” within casinos.
The messages are taught through games themselves, and Pellizzari says they find retention is higher: messages are understood, and absorbed. Meanwhile, playsmart centres offer free coffee, telephone chargers, and TVs which entice visitors and allow independent education specialists more time to interact with them.
Gateway, Canada's largest private casino operator, took over slot operations at Western Fair in May. The current lease, which costs Gateway $6 million a year, expires in 2020.

Source: Why I left Mujuru: Mutambara – DailyNews Live
14 February 2017
HARARE – Daily News writer, Farayi Machamire, chats to former ambassador
and Zimbabwe People First (ZPF) member, Retired Brigadier-General Agrippa
Mutambara, in the wake of the implosion of the Joice Mujuru-led opposition
party.
Q: This past week you joined dozens of ZPF party heavyweights who dumped
Joice Mujuru. Why did you feel compelled to make this decision?
A: Democracy is not best served by ostracising those with opposing views
but embracing them.
It was the unilateral dismissal of Mujuru from Zanu PF and the purging
that followed that convinced me that Zanu PF had breached the basic tenets
of democracy and had turned itself into an autocratic and repressive
regime.
For that reason, I announced my resignation from Zanu PF to join ZPF.
I am disappointed that the sacred democratic values that I hold dear are
once again being violated by the dismissals and promised purging taking
place in ZPF.
ZPF, led by Mujuru, has got its feet firmly lodged in sand, quicksand, the
more it struggles, the more it sinks into it.
Q: What type of person is Mujuru?
A: As a decent human being, I have respect for Mujuru. But as a leader I
find them indecisive and clueless.
The party is directionless and cruising on autopilot. I had to break from
the ZPF led by them
If there are matters that arise that need a leader to take a position, they
doesn't take a position.
And again, they also now wants to promote the culture of Zanu PF where
those vanoera Nzou (those who share the same totem as her) are being
brought closer.
The most disappointing thing is that they were expelled from Zanu PF for
having opposing views, now they are doing the same to those with opposing
views.
Q: Is this the beginning of the end for ZPF?
A: As far as we are concerned, ZPF is still there.
What we want is a new leader.
All those rallying behind Joice Mujuru, I know they think they are the
legitimate people, but they will soon realise they don't have the support
they think they have.
Q: You were left for dead by rampaging Zanu PF apparatchiks last year as
you tried to defend fellow ZPF comrades who were under siege?
Don't you feel now that all that was in vain?
A: I sacrificed a lot, I have been so involved…getting injured and so
forth. I am still facing court cases where I am footing my own bills.
But I tell you, they will be shocked to realise that they don't enjoy the
support that they think they have.
People tend to lie to them and yet they don't enjoy that support.
It is really sad that they can't handle disgruntlement, people are looking
for leadership but they are indecisive, they can't make a decision.
Q: What do you think all this does to the agenda to remove President
Robert Mugabe and the mooted grand coalition?
A: It makes it a little bit difficult but I think it is preparing us for a
better way forward. Because we were stuck in quicksand, as you try to
wriggle your way out, you sink more.
I believe the way we were going; we were not going to achieve anything.
You know the meetings of the ZPF supreme decision making body can last for
eight hours and nothing is resolved.
Instead of discussing real issues, people discuss gossip and gossip and
nothing is achieved and the leader has no control. Whoever thinks of
shouting shouts and so forth? I could no longer be a part of that.
Q: With everything happening, do you see yourself going back to Zanu PF?
A: To What? Zanu PF? Me? Never. Never. Not Zanu PF.
Q: What is your next move from here?
A: We are going to try reform ZPF and make it work for the people.
What happened (squabbles that led to desertions), it was not
representative of the party, it was unilateral.
So it defeats the purpose that we are People First when we take unilateral
decisions.
We are back again to Zanu PF dictatorial tendencies.

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — The Football Frenzy is working to bring you all the excitement as high school football playoffs draw nearer.
We're spotlighting these three games in Week 7:
Rockford Rams (4-2) at West Ottawa Panthers (5-1)
Kickoff: 7 p.m.
Outlook: First place is on the line as the two remaining unbeatens in the O-K Red Conference square off. West Ottawa has been the surprise team in the area after back-to-back 2-7 seasons. The Panthers have already surpassed their combined win total from the past two years and their only loss came against undefeated Forest Hills Central (30-27). The Rams dropped consecutive games to Lowell and Mona Shores, respectively, but have bounced back to win three in a row by racking up 117 points. Both teams possess stingy defenses as well, surrendering only 10 points per game. West Ottawa has allowed seven points or fewer in five of its six games. The Panthers are 9-39-1 all-time against the Rams with their last win coming in 2002. Rockford is seeking its 23rd straight playoff appearance.
Lowell Red Arrows (4-2) at Forest Hills Central Rangers (6-0)
Kickoff: 7 p.m.
Outlook: Forest Hills Central is perfect through six games for the first time since 1995 and will be tested by a Lowell squad that is trying to recover from a 28-14 setback against Cedar Springs last week. The Rangers' high-powered offense has recorded 253 points, while allowing only 78. Forest Hills Central suffered a pair of close losses to Lowell last season, including a 22-19 defeat in the regional finals. The Red Arrows, who also lost to East Grand Rapids in Week 3, have lost two or more games during the regular season only four times in the last 14 years.
Muskegon Oakridge Eagles (5-1) at Montague Wildcats (6-0)
Kickoff: 7 p.m.
Outlook: Montague has been rolling this season with an explosive offense that has averaged 57 points per game. The Wildcats blanked Hart last week after a wild 46-44 win over rival Whitehall. Montague's defense has recorded three shutouts. Muskegon Oakridge's lone loss occurred against Whitehall (28-14) two weeks ago as it searches for its 13th straight trip to the postseason. The Eagles defeated Montague 31-28 last season and hold a 34-19 edge in the all-time series.
We'll also have crews at these games (listed alphabetically by home team):
Battle Creek Harper Creek vs. Coldwater
Belding vs. Godwin Heights
Forest Hills Northern vs. Cedar Springs
Grand Rapids Catholic Central vs. Comstock Park

Other than Kimmy having yet another new job and the last season being broken up into two separate parts, one of the big differences about season four of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is the theme song. Gone is the catchy and somewhat empowering auto-tuned song of the first three seasons, and in its place is now an upbeat sitcom theme song called "Little Girl, Big City!." But, who sings the opening song in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt season four?
The song itself is a big change from the original song that proclaimed "females are strong as Hell," but it's still empowering in its own way, especially for a slightly more grown up Kimmy ready to make it on their own in the big city. Okay, that might be stretching it a bit, but you get the idea. If the voice in the song sounds familiar, that's because the opening song is actually performed by Jane Krakowski, who plays Jacqueline, a.k.a. Kimmy's former boss-turned-friend and now wannabe socialite.
The premiere episode of season four opens up with the theme song, and although some of the episodes following it doesn't feature the theme or any theme song at all, it was still likely meant to be the new official theme song of the show in its final season. Even ahead of the May 30 premiere of part one of season four, one of the promos featured the theme song and a chipper Kimmy getting ready for their day to the song that isn't unlike "Love Is all Around" from The Mary Tyler Moore Show's opening.
Of all of the stars of the show to sing the opening song in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Krakowski was probably an easy choice. Although fellow star Tituss Burgess is also an experienced singer, Krakowski has more than proven themselves to be an accomplished singer in their own right as well. She's previously won a Tony Award for their work on Broadway and continues to work in different productions while they appear in TV as well. And since Burgess has been given tons of opportunities to create some pretty epic songs and videos throughout the course of the show, Krakowski's turn came with the new theme song.
Most recently, Krakowski is part of the concert production of Beauty and the Beast, in which they play Mrs. Potts, and so far she's knocked it out of the park. So naturally, they were a stellar choice for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's new opening song.
Speaking of the song itself, according to Playbill, it was written by Jeff Richmond and Sam Means of Mean Girls musical fame, which was based on the movie by Tina Fey. In fact, the men were also previously nominated for an Emmy Award for their previous work in creating music for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Despite being another original song for the series, you can't help but liken it to "Love Is all Around" from the The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but I'm guessing that was kind of the point.
The original theme song for Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was all about Kimmy's rescue after being held in an underground bunker for the past 15 years, but this new theme song could be a symbol of Kimmy themselves moving on from being the victim that was abducted as a teenager. Don't get me wrong — I fully expect more of the same outrageous and goofy comedy that the series is known for, but the new opening song seems to symbolize a new and older Kimmy really taking steps toward moving forward and away from their past completely. This is the last season, after all, so it would kind of be perfect timing for that.

SAN FRANCISCO With Chief Executive Travis Kalanick taking a leave of absence from Uber Technologies Inc, the vacant job of chief operating officer takes on a lot more importance as the company frames the position as key to solving its woes.Kalanick, under fire for crass behaviour and fostering a culture of sexism and rule-breaking, in early March announced they were searching for a COO to help run the ride-services company. But in the months since, Uber has suffered a string of controversies and embarrassing setbacks and the job has remained unfilled - part of a leadership vacuum that extends through the company and up to the board of directors.In a report released Tuesday, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and their law firm, Covington & Burling, recommended sweeping management changes at Uber in the wake of sexual harassment allegations and other scandals. The report advocates for a COO who "will act as a full partner" and run "day-to-day operations." It also calls on the board of directors to take steps to limit the CEO's responsibilities and provide "clear lines of demarcation between" the COO and the CEO."The way the COO job is written in the recommendations makes it a really powerful and important job," said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser. Executive recruiters and tech investors agreed that the job might look more appealing now than it did before Tuesday's report. Still, it remains unclear if the company can attract a top-notch leader while Kalanick retains both the CEO title and, along with two allies, voting control of the company. Kalanick said on Tuesday they were stepping aside at Uber because they needed time to grieve their recently deceased mother and work on their leadership shortcomings, according to a staff email seen by Reuters. They also said their leave "may be shorter or longer than we might expect."Such ambiguity will effect Uber's efforts to rebuild its executive ranks, startup experts say.
"The lack of clarity around Travis' position hangs over everything," said Bill Aulet, managing director of the entrepreneurship centre at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "You're dealing with the most important thing, which is, who is your boss?"VACANCIES AT THE TOP
In the meantime, 14 people who report to Kalanick are charged with running the company until the CEO returns or a COO is hired. The company also is without a chief financial officer, general counsel and a head of engineering, among other open positions."We have a strong leadership team including veterans who helped make the business what it is today and new talent who are helping to drive the changes we're committed to making," Uber said in a statement.
Uber is struggling to recruit new employees and has many who are eager to leave. Ed Zschau, founder of Inductus Associates, an executive search firm for startups, said their firm has "people from Uber in the search process" for a new job, including senior-level employees."If the board can be recomposed a bit and get the company back on track, who the COO is will be an important signal as to whether people will want to work there," Zschau said.Concerns about a lack of leadership extend to the board of directors.Holder's recommendations, including prohibiting romantic relationships between bosses and their subordinates and drinking on the job, suggest the Uber board failed to ensure the company had even the most basic checks and balances, say experts.
"The Holder report could have been written by a law student who took an introductory corporate governance course," said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "The board shares responsibility for the wreck."Uber retained Holder's firm in February after a female former employee publicly accused the company of brazen sexual harassment. A wake of scandals followed, including a criminal investigation of the company's use of technology to evade regulators, a lawsuit alleging stolen self-driving car technology and a string of allegations relating to a toxic culture.On Tuesday, David Bonderman, a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, an Uber investor, resigned from the board after making a sexist comment about women talking too much at the Uber staff meeting convened to discuss the Holder report.The resignation leaves Uber's board with seven voting members and four vacant seats. Unlike the boards of most big companies, Uber's directors have little executive experience. In addition to Kalanick, the board includes co-founder and Chairman Garrett Camp, early employee Ryan Graves, venture capitalist Bill Gurley, Saudi investor Yasir al-Rumayyan and media impresaria Arianna Huffington. Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, was added to the board this week as an independent director.The Holder recommendations call for a restructured board, but the recommendation to install an independent board chair was left up to the board only to consider.

Over half of skilled EU workers employed by FTSE 250 companies are likely to leave the UK before Brexit, a new survey has shown, underscoring fears that the country is at risk of a severe brain drain following its departure from the bloc.
Fifty-six per cent of EU nationals surveyed by Baker McKenzie said they were "highly likely" or "quite likely" to leave the UK before the outcome of the Brexit negotiations was known, with healthcare (84%), technology, media and telecoms (64%) and financial services (43%) sectors likely to be the hardest hit.
The law firm surveyed 250 EU-27 citizens educated at degree level or higher, employed by companies either in the FTSE 250 or with revenue of over £50 million.
The findings indicate the serious staff shortages which could result from Brexit, and will increase political pressure to ensure access to talent is prioritised in upcoming talks with the EU.
Stephen Ratcliffe, employment partner at Baker McKenzie, warned companies could face a "significant skills shortage" in the near future, and urged them to take steps now to support and incentivise employees to stay within the business.
Already, 42% of those surveyed confirmed they had taken action to change their immigration status since last year's vote to leave the EU, with another 40% confirming their intention to do so.
They added that the situation could be exacerbated if there were any delays to the negotiations with the EU.
The survey also found that 70% of EU staff felt more exposed to discrimination since the Brexit vote, with 38% of those describing themselves as feeling "vulnerable" or "very vulnerable".
In the healthcare and financial services sectors, perceptions of discrimination were highest at 94% and 88% respectively.
In addition, more than one in four people surveyed feared job losses, with respondents citing the biggest threat to their jobs as discriminatory hiring practices.
"These findings would suggest that the perception of discrimination is a key driver for skilled EU nationals seeking to leave the UK," Mr Ratcliffe said.
"Employers should be refreshing their anti-discrimination policies, particularly in the context of recruitment, and offering their staff support as they face the consequences of Brexit."
The survey also revealed that more than half (55%) of EU-27 employees had not been offered any support by their employers in relation to Brexit.
Mr Ratcliffe added: "Employers who are reliant on EU workers should be taking active steps to engage with their employees on the subject of Brexit, and to offer them support and assistance to address areas of uncertainty for them and their families.
"Last week's election result and the current uncertainty around the immigration status of EU nationals, underlines the need for all employers - especially those reliant on EU workers - to address their employees' concerns around Brexit as a priority.
"Failure to do so could result in a significant skills drain for businesses in the near term, regardless of the Brexit deal reached," they warned.
The survey comes as the Government faces pressure to secure residence rights for EU citizens living in the UK, in particular for those working in the NHS.
A study by the Nursing & Midwifery Council earlier this week showed the number of nurses from the EU registering to work in the UK had fallen by 96% since the Brexit vote last year.
The number of new applicants from the EU fell from 1,304 in July last year to 43 in April this year, putting further strain on the health service as it grapples with a recruitment crisis.
Theresa May has pledged to limit immigration to the "tens of thousands", but following their electoral humiliation, they are likely to come under pressure from Tory colleagues to drop the proposal.

These factors are expected to see the bottom line recover from an anticipated 23% earnings fall for the year that ended in February. And City analysts are predicting a 1% dip in the present period before Bloomsbury bounces back with an 8% earnings rise in fiscal 2019.
And current forecasts make Bloomsbury splendid value at the minute, the company dealing on a prospective P/E ratio of 14.9 times, just below the benchmark of 15 times widely considered attractive value.
Furthermore, broker estimates also provide particularly good news for dividend chasers. An estimated 6.7p per share dividend for fiscal 2017 is expected to rise to 7p and 7.4p in the following two years, meaning Bloomsbury checks out with handsome yields of 4.1% and 4.3% for these periods.
Cash machine
Those seeking market-mashing dividend yields should also take a long look at Chesnara (LSE: CSN), in my opinion.
Like Bloomsbury, the life insurance giant is anticipated to endure earnings turbulence in the near term. In 2017 the company is expected to enjoy a 7% earnings rise before an 18% bottom-line slip transpires next year.
But as a side note, current projections leave Chesnara dealing on a mega-cheap forward P/E multiple of 12.9 times.
Despite the predicted profits pain however, the company's excellent solvency position — not to mention its still-robust long-term growth outlook — mean Chesnara is still expected to keep dividends rolling higher. The company's Solvency II ratio rose to 158% as of December from 146% a year earlier.
Chesnara has hiked dividends for 12 years on the spin, and this year is predicted to pay a 20.1p per share dividend, up from an expected 19.5p in 2016 and yielding 5.3%. And an anticipated 20.6p reward in 2018 yields a spectacular 5.4%.
The Preston business snapped up Legal & General Nederland in November 2016 for €160m, a move which is expected “to have a significant positive impact on the Economic Value of the group and will further enhance ongoing cash generation thereby supporting the continuation of our dividend strategy.”
And Chesnara's healthy appetite for acquisitions could provide the ammunition for dividends to keep on climbing.
Embattled movie exec Harvey Weinstein had little to say early Friday as they emerged from their posh West Village townhouse, a day after being accused of sexually harassing young women in a scathing exposé.
Weinstein had a small rolling suitcase with them and a handful of papers as they left their Bank Street home just before 8 a.m.
“I respect you guys. You've always been good to me,” Weinstein said before being whisked away by a driver.
About 90 minutes later, their wife Georgina Chapman, the co-founder of fashion label Marchesa, said nothing as they left the apartment in an all-denim ensemble and jumped into a car that was packed with Louis Vuitton luggage.
The Miramax and Weinstein Company co-founder told The Post Thursday that they planned to sue the New York Times for $50 million for “reckless reporting” in their bombshell story.
The piece, published Thursday, accused Weinstein of decades of sexual harassment and said they paid at least eight women — including actor Rose McGowan — between $80,000 to $150,000 each to settle their complaints.
Similar allegations were lodged by actor Ashley Judd, who told the Times they were filming 1997's “Kiss the Girls” when Weinstein lured them to their hotel room, offered them a massage and asked whether they wanted to watch them shower.
Judd was not one of the women who received a settlement from the married father of five.
ScreenJunkies creator Andy Signore has been suspended following a bombshell claim that they sexually abused at least two women.
One woman named Emma Bowers shared their story on social media, recalling a time Signore allegedly requested that they watch them masturbate while they were an intern for the media company. A second woman, April Dawn, claimed on social media that Signore tried to sexually assault them on “multiple occasions,” but ScreenJunkies HR failed to take their allegation seriously and only had Signore's interests at heart.
Dawn's explicit allegations include details of how Signore allegedly “took out sex toys and tried to force them” inside them They also claim they promised them a position at ScreenJunkies in exchange for “sexual favors.”
Signora has been married to their wife, Miranda Signore, since 2006. They have one child together.
ScreenJunkies and its parent company, Defy Media, released a statement Friday detailing their next steps.
Some ScreenJunkies employees have responded to the reports expressing their disappointment and dismay.
“Sickened, saddened, and frankly in shock right now. Not going into work that's for sure,” tweeted “Honest Trailers” head writer Spencer Gilbert.
ScreenJunkies film critic Dan Murrell tweeted, “I'm numb. I don't know what to do. Questioning everything I thought I knew. To those that came forward – I hear you and I believe you.”
Many women have turned to social media to detail their personal experiences with sexual assault and harassment after the New York Times released a bombshell report on Thursday claiming Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed female employees for decades.
Signore did not respond to a request for comment.
MINNEAPOLIS — Battling the flu, pop star Pink powered through a pre-Super Bowl concert, still hitting high notes, flying in the air and dancing onstage days before they will sing the national anthem at the big game.
Pink skipped some of the words during the songs, relying on their backup singers Friday at Nomadic Live at the Armory in Minneapolis. But they were still energetic and spirited, ending the set with their signature high-flying athleticism while singing the pounding hit, “So What.”
The mother of two told the audience they had the flu and that their children “cough into my mouth and I can't stop them 'cause they're so cute.”
“I'm not going to sound like (crap) all night because you guys are going to help me,” they said. “We're going to rock the (expletive) out and have a good time.”
As they began to sing “Beautiful Trauma” — from their recent album of the same name — they quickly stopped their band and told the crowd, “I can't do it.”
“I hate this,” they said. “I can't do that song. I'm sorry.”
Pink will sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” on Sunday at the U.S. Bank Stadium before the New England Patriots take on the Philadelphia Eagles. The 38-year-old singer grew up about 30 miles from Philadelphia and gave a shout-out to the City of Brotherly Love during the show.
They wore a loose white top, loose white pants and red heels as they ran up and down the stage, kicking off the show with the jam “Get the Party Started.” They later sang well-known hits like “U + Ur Hand,” ″Who Knew,” ″What About Us” and “Raise Your Glass.”
Despite feeling under the weather, they were exceptional when they covered 4 Non Blondes' “What's Up,” a crowd favorite.
“We're gonna wake up the entire neighborhood,” they said before singing the song.
The nose just might be the sexiest organ on the human body.
People with a higher sensitivity to smell report more pleasurable sexual activities, according to findings of a new study by German researchers in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. And women with a better sense of smell report a higher frequency of orgasms during sexual intercourse.
The study, led by Johanna Bendas of the Technical University of Dresden, looked at the odor sensitivity of 42 women and 28 men ages 18 to 36 using ‘Sniffin' Sticks' that measured the level at which a person could detect a smelly chemical.
The participants were then asked a series of questions about their sexual desire, experience (frequency of orgasm, perceived pleasantness of sexual activities) and performance (frequency and average duration of sexual intercourse).
The analysis found no correlation between odor sensitivity and sexual desire or sexual performance. But a higher sensitivity to odors did correlate positively with sexual experience.
“The experience of sexual interactions appears to be enriched by olfactory input,” the study concludes. “The perception of certain body odors may contribute to the concept of sexual pleasure by enhanced recruitment of reward areas.”
The researchers suggest that “the perception of body odors such as vaginal fluids, sperm and sweat seems to enrich the sexual experience” by increasing sexual arousal.
More: How often should you have sex with your partner?
The study has some limitations and doesn't account for causation and other factors that might be at play, according to the British Psychological Society.
Researchers did control for women's use of hormonal contraception but did not consider their stage of menstrual cycle, which can have an impact on sense of smell.

Den of Thieves movie review: Gerard Butler's latest is trashy entertainment in guise of cop drama
1.5/5
When you watch a movie with Gerard Butler in it you get some sort of package deal — ludicrous plotting, over the top macho action, cheesy lines and a general disregard for cinematic intelligence. This is very much the case with their new film Den of Thieves, another round of trashy entertainment under the guise of police action drama.
The film is directed by Christian Gudegast, who previously wrote the grotesque London Has Fallen, so predictably we get the unshaven grungy hero archetype saving the world from even grungier villains. This time Butler plays a police detective named Big Nick who leads a sort of elite quad that is deployed to catch elite gangsters. An armoured truck is attacked as part of a heist by Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber), the leader of a gang who makes off with the truck with an even bigger plan in mind. Big Nick has to assemble their team, deal with their stereotypically irritating ex wife (Dawn Oliviery) and hinder the villain's villainous villainy.
The problem is everything about the film is cliché, right from the prototypical characters, to the plot twists which includes the innocent looking guy who turns out to be a big player, to the standard issue gun play with triggers being pulled by sweaty muscular men, to boring car chases where the car swerves and careens when it doesn't need to, and many more beats that make the film look like a rejected script from the '90s. It is reminiscent of 2016's John Hillcoat flick Triple 9 which also dealt dumb blows despite having an air of avante garde cinema. Contrast this to Ben Affleck's amazing The Town which constantly found new ways to deliver thrills, drama and characters in a cliché setting. The difference between the two films is literally the touch of a director who prefers finesse and silences instead of tonal noise.
The film also tries to emulate sequences from Michael Mann's classic Heat, including the epic moment where the master cop finally meets the master goon — but there is no intensity because of the way the film is lit, nor in the performances so it resembles a high school play by a student who watched Heat a bunch of times on TV.
Maybe this film needed someone like Nicholas Cage to truly embrace its B-movie sensibilities — it could have made at least for a much less serious watch. Maybe it's time Hollywood looked away from home and noticed the kind of stuff the Brazilians and the Italians are making in the cops and robbers genre — Gomorrah and Suburra, both of which are TV shows on Netflix are far more powerful than this supposed big stakes action thriller. If there's anything this film does, it gives you new found respect for Denis Villeneuve for crafting an interesting new take on the genre in Sicario, and if you've seen the trailer of the sequel you're better off waiting to invest in that film rather than this one.

North Korea released US student Otto Warmbier "on humanitarian grounds", state media said Thursday, two days after they were evacuated from Pyongyang after falling into a coma while imprisoned in a labour camp.
The 22-year-old University of Virginia student from Cincinnati had spent more than a year in North Korean detention after being arrested for stealing a political poster from a hotel. Their family have said they were "terrorised and brutalised" by Kim Jong-Un's regime.
"Otto Frederick Warmbier, who had been in hard labour, was sent back home on 13 June, 2017 on humanitarian grounds according to the adjudication made on the same day by the Central Court of the DPRK," the state-run Korean Central News Agency said in a one-line statement.
Warmbier's release came after a flurry of secret diplomatic contacts between Washington and Pyongyang, which culminated in Joseph Yun, the State Department's special envoy on North Korea, travelling to Pyongyang to secure Warmbier's release.
"Joseph Yun went to Pyongyang to accompany Warmbier home," Thomas Shannon, undersecretary of state for political affairs, told reporters in Seoul Wednesday.
Warmbier's parents Fred and Cindy have said that they were told their son had been in a coma since March 2016, allegedly after falling ill from botulism and being given a sleeping pill.
"Otto is not in great shape right now," Fred Warmbier told Fox News on Wednesday after their son arrived back in the US on a military airplane and was taken straight to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for urgent treatment.
Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labour, a punishment the US decried as far out of proportion to their alleged crime, accusing the North of using them as a political pawn.
The New York Times reported a senior US official as saying the authorities recently received intelligence indicating Warmbier was repeatedly beaten while in custody.
Coma like 'accident'
Go Myong-Hyun, researcher at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told AFP that it was unlikely North Korea would have intentionally put a detained US citizen -- valuable diplomatic bargaining chips for Pyongyang -- into a coma.
"It must have been an accident and that's probably why they were hiding it for a year," they said.
"If they wanted to get something from the US by torturing Warmbier, they would have live-streamed or at least issued photos of them being tortured," they said, adding the regime was likely "perplexed" by the entire situation.
Three more US citizens are currently being held by North Korea, including two men who taught at a Pyongyang university funded by overseas Christian groups, and a Korean-American pastor who was accused of espionage for the South.
Foreigners who have been detained or imprisoned in North Korea, such as US missionary Kenneth Bae, have later said they endured long hours of strenuous work, health problems, and verbal and emotional abuse by their captors.
Koo Kab-Woo, professor at Seoul's University of North Korean Studies told AFP that Warmbier's release "on humanitarian grounds" did not mean Pyongyang was admitting to any kind of maltreatment or health problems.
"North Korea would have calculated before their release and hoped for a positive effect," on bilateral ties, they said, adding that this could backfire if Warmbier's health condition was more serious than they had anticipated.
"The case is definitely different from previous releases of detainees," which have usually come after a visit from high-profile political figures, including former president Bill Clinton.
The release came amid tension between Washington and Pyongyang following a series of missile tests by the North, focusing attention on an arms buildup that Pentagon chief Jim Mattis on Monday dubbed "a clear and present danger to all."
Washington has stepped up pressure on China and other foreign powers to enforce existing UN sanctions, and has deployed increased military assets of its own in the region.
Warmbier's evacuation coincided with the arrival in Pyongyang of flamboyant retired NBA basketball star Dennis Rodman — a former contestant on US President Trump's "Celebrity Apprentice" reality show — but US officials have said Rodman had nothing to do with the release.
Aside from a few select people, no one knows if the Montreal Canadiens' day on July 1 played out how it was supposed to. That list begins with Habs general manager Marc Bergevin.
Bergevin Dreams in Technicolor
It's nice to think it did, though… that Bergevin was able to properly assess their team's strengths and weaknesses and determine going after and overpaying a slew of mediocre free agents just wasn't best for the long-term health of the Habs. Just look at what the Habs didn't give up for now-St. Louis Blue Ryan O'Reilly, anyway. The Habs barely have one center, let alone three.
If that's how it played out in Bergevin's mind, they deserve some measure of kudos, as it's a game plan he's seemingly been able to stick to since owner Geoff Molson admitted all the Habs' unused cap space from this past year had been earmarked for Alexander Radulov and Andrei Markov; Once they jumped ship, the Habs weren't going to spend it just for the sake of being a cap team.
Take the NHL Entry Draft for example. That's when Bergevin opted to go off the board to draft center Jesperi Kotkaniemi, who likely won't be ready for NHL action for a few years. In so doing, they passed on winger Filip Zadina, who by many accounts would have been ready to jump in right away, especially on a team as woefully undermanned on the right side as the Habs.
Of course, Bergevin is telling a very different story, saying the Habs are still looking to make the playoffs next season, which would run counter to every logical impulse analysts might have, looking at a largely unchanged roster from the one that just finished fourth from last.
Plekanec Instead of Tavares
Sure, Max Domi is in and Alex Galchenyuk is out, but that's a downgrade on paper. And, yes, the acquisition and buy-out of Steve Mason ahead of July 1 was a sly way to use the cap space at Bergevin's disposal to acquire a serviceable middle-six winger in Joel Armia. But, the last time anyone checked, Armia was only a depth player on an actually good team in the Winnipeg Jets… and hardly anyone's idea of a savior.
Finally, in bringing back Tomas Plekanec and effectively making them their centerpiece free-agent acquisition on July 1, the Habs have almost guaranteed they'll more likely be in the running for last overall than eighth in the Eastern Conference. And there's little wrong with that at this stage of the game.
Of course, the move does make for what might be the worst-ever trade between the Habs and Maple Leafs, with the center that Toronto got instead being somewhat of an upgrade over the one they let hit free agency. And it's conveniently John Tavares who represents the one hiccup in the narrative this is all part of some master plan.
Seeing as there had been undeniable interest in Tavares from the Habs, who only found out it was unreciprocated after the draft, the earliest Bergevin and company could have opted to go ahead with their hypothetical rebuild was after they picked Kotkaniemi.
Habs found out they were out on Tavares when the free agency conversation window opened. "We were disappointed, but it's their decision." said GM Marc Bergevin in French. — Eric Engels (@EricEngels) July 1, 2018
Canadiens vs. Leafs
So, can Habs fans actually trust Bergevin when they say: “Je ne suis pas prêt à dire qu'on fait une reconstruction?” Hell, no. Why part with tradition, now? Especially when the re-acquisition of Plekanec says the Habs are still more focused on the past than the future? All it means is no one outside the Canadiens can be sure whether or not Bergevin's failure to secure a free agent of any consequence on July 1 was on purpose or part of on an ongoing trend of futility dating back several years.
Truth be told, if Habs fans are jealous of the Leafs, consider how the Canadiens' longtime division rivals had to finish last just a few years ago to give a jump-start to what had just recently been an organization that literally went 12 years with a single playoff appearance. And that one ended far from well.
In other words, the Habs need to suck for a while in order to get good again. And, as fate would have it, Bergevin has assembled the perfect team for such a mission impossible, even if it's been in spite of himself. Look at it this way: If you want someone at the helm of the team, responsible for making the Habs as bad as imaginable, wouldn't Bergevin be the right man for the job? Their qualifications are astounding (in that one respect).
A True Rebuild Starts at the Top
Of course, for it to be a true rebuild, the Habs would have to trade Carey Price and Shea Weber, assuming there are takers for either of them. At the very least, because Price has a no-movement clause, Weber must go, but Bergevin can't realistically be expected to trade the guy they got back for P.K. Subban.
Doing so would be an admission of wrongdoing and incompetence, and, seeing as Bergevin can't so much as utter the word “rebuild” in the affirmative, it's time for them to go.
Even if you want to give them every benefit of the doubt and argue he's finally on track with a legitimate five-year plan, he's not special. Even if you believe they have to deny the Habs are tanking from here on out for the financial well-being of the team, he's still become the face of the organization… and therein lies part of the problem. They shouldn't be, in more ways than one. He's become a caricature of contradiction, to the point that one can't be sure if he's even believing most of what they say. Again, they shouldn't be.
As decent of a job as he's admittedly done this offseason, most every NHL executive can set their sights on a non-playoff finish next season and deliver. Bergevin's taken this team as far as they can, into the ground. You don't need to be a general manager to know being on the verge of losing three out of the last four seasons? People lose their jobs as a result. It should be someone else's turn, now.

Late June 2015 in the sleepy suburban city of Greenacres in Palm Beach, Florida, and the peace is shattered by a series of shots ringing out across the neighborhood. Nevertheless, it was not until the next day that a horrifying discovery was made inside the home of Greenacres resident Nilda Sheffield. The 53-year-old grandmother and three of their family members had been gruesomely slain. Sheffield, their 31-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Flores, and two infant grandchildren had all been shot dead. The police did not have to look far for potential perpetrators, but the killer would turn out to be the last person that anyone would have suspected.
Elizabeth Flores had been in their twenties when they had a son, Xavier, with their then partner Derek Neff in January 2008. Unfortunately, however, the couple's relationship soon broke down. And for most of their subsequent young life, their little boy found themselves trapped in an emotional custody battle between their two warring parents.

Eventually, both Flores and Neff moved on to new lives, with Xavier spending most of their time with their mom. While Neff married a woman named Michelle and had another son, Isaiah, Flores began dating David Chiddo. The latter was a petty criminal with a lengthy police record stretching back to 2002. But despite their new boyfriend's checkered past, and a somewhat tempestuous bond, Flores nevertheless fell pregnant once more.

Beginning of the end for three strikes law
STUFF Andrew Little on three strikes reform.
Justice Minister Andrew Little has signalled what could be the beginning of the end of New Zealand's three strikes law.
Speaking to media at the Beehive on Wednesday evening, Little said a proposal was going to Cabinet in about 10 days time to endorse a repeal of the controversial law.
"It will then go through the normal legislative, Parliamentary process. We are not doing wholesale reform until we get a good public debate going."
GRANT MATTHEW/STUFF Justice Minister Andrew Little says the three strikes rule is not working.
They said the tough line the justice system was currently taking on criminals was "not working".

* Andrew Little says three strikes law will be repealed
* Law Society slams three strikes bill
"I think there is an acceptance now that it just doesn't work," Little said.
"If you have a sentence of two years or less, you're at the lower end of offending ... we can still do something with you, so it's better that you're out in the community."
Little first announced the controversial law would be repealed in November last year.
At the time Little said the law had not reduced crime rates and failed to act as an effective deterrent.
"It's been eight years since this got onto the statute books and it's not making a blind bit of difference. It's time to find something new, something different."
The three strikes policy was introduced in 2010 and dictates repeat violent offenders will not be eligible for parole after their third offence.
An offender would receive a standard sentence and warning for their first serious offence. The second offence would usually lead to a jail term with no parole and a further warning. On conviction for a third serious offence, the offender would receive the maximum penalty in prison for that offence with no parole.
Forty offences – including murder, manslaughter, sexual violation, abduction, kidnapping and aggravated robbery – count as a strike under the law, pursued by the Act Party in 2010.

From a financial perspective, Disney's purchase of the franchise from Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.1 billion (all figures U.S. dollars) looks like a steal. The company's stock has doubled since the purchase, and the first two films released — The Force Awakens and Rogue One — have already raked in $3 billion worldwide just at the box office. That doesn't count the mammoth amount of merchandise that has sold alongside them.
With The Last Jedi hitting theatres this week, and five more films in the works, a TV series in the works, countless toys, media and marketing tie-ins, which is now only going to ramp up in annual fanfare of a release, the question is can there be too much Star Wars?
Star Wars is the scruffy little nerf-herder that has grown into a giant Sarlacc pit of pop culture, hoping to consume our fandom for the next thousand years. Or at least it's owner, Disney, hopes so.
That said, Sandler says that the blockbuster action franchises are exactly what the modern film studios — and their giant corporate parents — are built upon, with the films not just lucrative in themselves but also as a source of spinoff toys, merchandising and other deals.
“People see these things as universes and know that if they invest their time and money in these things, well, (maybe the movies) won't be as good, but maybe the other things will be good, whether it's a video game or board game or app or something.”
“At least with Star Wars, one could say that there never has been too much. Even when people didn't like the (prequel) films, the Star Wars franchise lived on in video games and on television in animated form,” says Kevin Sandler, a professor of film and cinema studies at Arizona State University, who also studies the history of the movie business and film marketing.
Star Wars has actually thrived even when there weren't any movies in the offing, which has helped its resiliency. In 40 years, the franchise is only on its ninth film. Compare that to the Marvel cinematic universe, which has released 17 films since 2008. From Disney's perspective, that's a sign of how much Star Wars can still grow — and why we will as we likely see an annual film in the franchise for the foreseeable future.
“It is the engine that drives the bus. It is the most conspicuous piece of property or product that any giant media conglomerate can have. Movies are things that people talk about, the thing that (media) cover the most, the most dynamic, the largest, the most mass thing that's consumed at one time,” said Sandler. That simultaneous participation, they add, is “a major thing with advertising . . . There's a timeliness to this type of medium you just don't see anywhere else.”
That's one reason that they think it's smart that Star Wars and Marvel are planning and announcing so many films into the future. It's a sign to consumers who are invested in these franchises that the companies are, too.
Planning far ahead could be a liability, but so far, it is easy enough to see when these things go sour, and the Star Wars machine shows no sign of slowing down from hyperdrive. Sandler points to Warner Bros. and the issues with its DC Comics-derived superhero movies, like Batman vs. Superman and Justice League, which to be fair are raking in money, but considered disappointments.
This past summer, a lot of experts pointed to “franchise fatigue” as a reason for the disappointing commercial returns of series like Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, Aliens: Covenant and War for the Planet of The Apes, but those are all lesser franchises, and the less than stellar reviews (except for Apes) helped sink them. But franchise fatigue had no effect on the three Marvel films released this year — Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Thor Ragnarok and Spider-Man: Homecoming, which all brought in more than $800 million at the box office. The Last Jedi would be considered a disappointment if it did worse than that.
One key pattern that film-studies professors are noticing is that in both the cases of the Marvel and Star Wars films, the braintrusts behind them are choosing good directors who can bring something a little different to the franchise.
“New but familiar is the key thing with these films. It has to be formulaic, it has fit in a genre, but it has to be new at the same time,” says Philippe Gauthier, professor of film and cinema at Queen's University. “Take a look at Thor Ragnarok. They hired a brilliant, independent filmmaker (Taika Waititi) who was able to keep an artistic vision within this rigid production system. That's what people seem to like, because it was kind of new.”
Thor Ragnarok was a much funnier take on the Asgardian hero than the previous two installments in that character's series, and that points to how the companies are looking to differentiate their offerings. The in-development Marvel film New Mutants looks like it's going for a traditional horror-movie vibe.
Whatever the plan, there's no guarantee that these films will continue to go up. The experts do think that there will reach a point where oversaturation will be a concern. That said, Disney is a company that has had a stable of characters for a long time, and is probably the best at managing these properties across various media.
Gauthier does think see one factor that might make these franchises run out of steam. One of reason that they do so well is nostalgia: the consumers' desire to return to the joys of their youth, and for people with families, pass it on the next generation.
“The studios and producers are taking advantage of people's tendencies to like the familiar. If I wanted to go deep, in the kind of complex and troubled world that we are in right now, that return to something familiar is welcome and heartwarming,” they say. “This nostalgia (is) is a force that helps sells movies now (but) it will go away over time, because it looks like we are having a Star Wars or Marvel movie every year . . . how can we be nostalgic of the past, if the past is always present?”

As of Friday, the big face-off at the box office is between Winchester, which placed at number one with $3.6 million, and Maze Runner: The Death Cure, which is currently in second with $3 million at the top of its second frame. The two are separated by less than $600,000, which means that its really anybody's game right now, but if one were pulling for the more substantive movie, Winchester would inarguably be favored over the droning, plot-centric tedium of the latest Maze Runner movie.
The difference, of course, is that Winchester, as helmed by the Spierig brothers, is the better-directed movie by a country mile. Wes Ball, who has directed all of the Maze Runner movies, has a certain talent for action sequences but their sense of invention ends just about there. The Spierig brothers, on the other hand, have shown wild visual imagination in Predestination, Daybreakers, and, despite its flimsy, thoughtless script, last year's Jigsaw. The premise and story of Maze Runner is seemingly all that matters to the production, whereas Winchester, for all its undisputed faults, shows a deep, lively concern for notions of the metaphysical and spiritual fear.
Similarly, Jake Kasdan‘s touch for comedic framing and timing is part of what has kept Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle in the top five for so long now. The Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart vehicle dropped to third on Friday with $2.8 million and its looking like the movie will pass the $350 million mark by the time the Super Bowl starts up this weekend. Meanwhile, The Greatest Showman and Hostiles rounded out the rest of the top five in fourth and fifth with $2.2 million and $1.6 million respectively. These films are also marked by a distinct-ish sense of style, especially in the case of Hostiles, but neither push against the rigidity of their scripts the way the Spierigs do. It might just be enough for them to squeak out a win over the weekend.
Here's your top five for Friday:
It was the commander and cheeks!
Kim Kardashian strutted into the Oval Office on Wednesday for a sit-down with President Donald Trump to discuss criminal justice issues — including an imprisoned drug offender they discovered on Twitter.
The reality queen donned high heels and an all-black ensemble for the highly-anticipated White House meeting.
Kardashian was spotted entering the West Wing around 4:45 p.m. and leaving about an hour later.
They spoke with both Trump and their advisers, including Jared Kushner, whom they met through Ivanka Trump, according to sources.
The mother-of-three requested the White House meeting after hearing about the plight of Alice Marie Johnson on social media late last year.
“This is so unfair,” Kardashian tweeted in October 2017, along with a link to an interview Johnson, 63, did on Mic.com.
Sources told The Post that Kardashian argued that Johnson — a great-grandmother who never actually sold any drugs — had paid their debt to society after 21 years behind bars and deserves clemency.
The meeting went “well,” sources said, and now the decision is in Trump's hands.
After the meeting, Kardashian headed to Ivanka and Jared's DC home for a private dinner.
It was to be a continuation of the White House meeting, since Kushner is a passionate advocate for criminal justice reform after living through their father's imprisonment.
“Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you,” Kardashian tweeted before arriving in Washington.
They were accompanied by their personal their attorney, Shawn Holley, who is helping Johnson.
The first-time non-violent drug offender was sentenced to life in prison in 1997 after they admitted to acting as an intermediary for drug pushers.
While President Barack Obama granted 1,927 clemency requests before leaving office, Johnson was not one of them.
“This main thing is we want Ms. Alice free and we want to raise awareness to the broader issue that people are sentenced to die in prison,” said Brittany Barnett, a member of their legal team.
“Ms. Alice is serving the same amount of time as the Unibomber. People need to feel that.”
Kardashian was able to build a relationship with Johnson thanks to their friendship with Jessica Jackson Sloan, who directs the Dream Corps' #cut50 initiative.
Sloan was at the White House earlier this month working with Kushner and Trump on criminal justice reform. The president is sincerely interested in getting something done on prison reform, they said.
“Kim is looking at this from a human rights and human dignity perspective,” Barnett said. “It went like two friends. One friend is trying to save the life of the other.”
Kardashian helped fund and assemble a legal team for Johnson.
After the meeting, Trump tweeted a photo of the two together at the Resolute Desk, with them seated and their standing to their right.
“Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing,” they wrote. It was later retweeted by the @POTUS account.
The White House meeting was a culmination of weeks of planning that started with Kardashian reaching out to Ivanka, who then put them in touch with Kushner — a champion of prison reform.
It came just weeks after Kardashian's husband, Kanye West, came under fire for publicly voicing their support for Trump.
While the rapper is a fan of the president, it's unclear if their wife feels the same way.
Trump has ridiculed Kardashian in the past — and even body-shamed them while speaking on the “Howard Stern Show.”
“Do they have a good body? No. Do they have a fat ass? Absolutely,” Trump said during a 2013 interview.
Surprisingly, Kim is not the first Kardashian to grace the halls of the White House. Them sister, Khloe, accompanied ex-husband Lamar Odom during the Lakers' championship visit in 2010 and got to meet Obama.
June 14 is a day to honor the American flag. Went Funeral Home in Moline takes the opportunity to retire American flags dropped off throughout the year.
The Wendt's, who come from a long line of service, say the tradition is one they are proud to be a part of.
“It's part of the reason I'm proud of being a vet,” said Patrick Wendt. “I supported that flag throughout the world.”
It was an emotional day for the Vietnam War veteran.
“You see the sacrifice of all the men that have gone before us and died and been maimed for our freedom, and it's symbolic,” Wendt said as ashes of flags burned behind him. “That's why it brings tears to our eyes.”
They say Flag Day is all about the stars and stripes.
“We can remember our veterans but this is for our flag. That's why we're doing it.”
More than 300 flags were properly disposed of.
Wendt's brother, Earl, is the director of Wendt Funeral Home where they collect flags that have faded and torn as they stand proudly over homes and in front of graves.
“They need to be retired,” Earl Wendt said. “And that's what we're doing. We're retiring flags today. And we are doing the proper retirement.”
The final goodbye consists of the national anthem, a salute, and taps before each flag is tossed into the flames.
“Only way to properly honor the flag is to get rid of it in a very special ceremonial way,” Patrick said.
Wendt Funeral Home began collecting flags after Moline's American Legion Post closed.
“We think it's a great honor the American Legion saw fit to use us as a depository for the flags,” Earl said.
The family has a long history of service.
“Wendt line has been in virtually every war we ever fought, starting with the revolution,” Patrick said.
And the Wendt's say they are honored to take care of America's greatest symbol.
“We're proud Americans, we're proud of our flag,” Patrick said.
Flags are collected at the funeral home 24/7. A depository box sits in the parking lot.
Actress Patricia Arquette is a keynote speaker during a week of science and technology events at Illinois State University.
University officials say the events at the campus in Normal this week will include a professional development dinner and a conference on women in leadership.
Arquette's talk is scheduled for Thursday evening. It's free and open to the public. She's expected to talk about a public health organization they founded in 2010 after a deadly earthquake in Haiti.
Arquette won an Academy Award in 2014 for their supporting role in the movie “Boyhood” and a 2005 Emmy Award for their leading role in the television show “Medium.”
Roughly 20,000 students attend Illinois State in graduate and undergraduate programs.
COLLINSVILLE — The Illinois Department of Transportation will host a public outreach meeting to discuss the development of the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program and District Eight's Multi-Year Highway Improvement Program from 4-7 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 23, at the IDOT District 8 Office, 1102 Eastport Plaza Drive.
The public will have an opportunity to review and comment on both programs, current programming procedures, and other information presented. All persons interested are invited to attend.
The meeting will be held in an open-house format. Representatives from IDOT will be available to answer questions.

LOS ANGELES – Two impressive Toronto Raptors streaks came to an end late Monday night at the hands of the Los Angeles Clippers.
A six-game winning run, one of the longest in team history, and a 15-0 start to this season of closing out games where a lead was taken into the final quarter.
Toronto led 74-70 heading into the final frame before going ice cold in an eventual 96-91 loss.
It was a bit of a throwback contest, with Clippers behemoth DeAndre Jordan (14 points, 16 rebounds) and Raptors counterpart Jonas Valanciunas (23 and 15) dominating, while most of the guards couldn't shoot straight. Kyle Lowry's first field goal didn't come until the third quarter and DeMar DeRozan also was off of the mark. The ball moved well early, with the visitors collecting eight assists on 10 first quarter baskets. DeRozan had six assists at the half and the team only managed five more as a whole from that point on.
The Raptors went a dismal 7-for-29 (24%) from beyond the three-point arc, the Clippers an even worse 8-for-36 (22.2%).
“We just didn't play well enough to earn the win,” said head coach Dwane Casey.
Point guard Milos Teodosic hit the dagger three-pointer late in the fourth, in their return to the lineup for the first time since the second game of the season and Lowry and Valanciunas weren't thrilled about the many errors that led to the loss.
“I didn't make many threes (Lowry went 0-for-8 and has one more three-pointer than Valanciunas over the past two games). I missed a lot of shots, turnovers, but we gave up 14 offensive rebounds and as guards we have to be in there and rebound a bit better,” they said.
“This was one of our (worst) rebounding games out there, but it happens … we should have won that game and we need to do things to make sure we win that game.”
The Raptors had won at Sacramento a night earlier, but refused to use the back-to-back as an excuse.
“We can find a lot of excuses: Back-to-back, tired, but we've got to win those games. That's it. We cannot search for excuses,” Valanciunas said.
“Everything adds up, they had what, 14, 15 offensive rebounds? We've got to do a better job on the glass and stuff like that. Some easy mistakes … These things add up and cost us the game.”
The Toronto bench struggled again, getting outscored 51-17, with ex-Raptor Lou Williams and big man Montrezl Harrell each scoring 17.
The longest winning streaks in franchise history came in 2016 (11 games) and in 2002 (nine). There also was a seven-game run in 2000.
The Raptors stayed in Los Angeles and will fly to Phoenix on Tuesday in advance of Wednesday's game against Phoenix.

History has been made as Tehmina Janjua, currently serving as Pakistan's permanent representative to the United Nations (UN) in Geneva, has been appointed the new foreign secretary by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, becoming the first woman ever to hold the Foreign Office's top post.
Ms Janjua has long been considered a favourite for the position, as they have decades of experience in foreign service, having joined in 1984.
They have extensive experience in multilateral diplomacy, making them a well-suited candidate for the job.
In December 2016, they helped Pakistan make history when they became the first woman, and the first developing country representative, to preside over the Conference of Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) Fifth Review Conference.
They were elected unanimously as the President of the CCW, indicating recognition of them and the country's strong credentials in multilateral diplomacy as well as in international arms control related issues.
Them successful flight attendantship of the conference towards a practical outcome was widely appreciated, both by the international community and amongst their colleagues at home.
They have served as ambassador to Rome from December 2011 to October 2015, earning their high praise for their capabilities.
Among their other overseas postings are stints at the UN in New York and Geneva.
They have also been posted for a year at the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe desk at the start of their foreign service career.
They most certainly is the right person for the top job and the Prime Minister must also be appreciated for making a good choice for the future of Pakistan's diplomatic relationship with the rest of world.
The posting is especially welcome at a time when the country needs to present a strong foreign policy and objectives in the face of hostility from neighbouring countries and to ensure the future of CPEC in an environment of multilateral cooperation.

Czech authorities have halted the extradition proceedings of Salih Muslum, the former co-chair of the terrorist PKK's Syrian offshoot Democratic Union Party (PYD), a state attorney's office said yesterday.
Muslum was briefly detained in February after Turkey issued a red notice against him. Their release from detention, following a Feb. 27 court order, caused a diplomatic row between Prague and Ankara, which accuses Muslum of aggravated murder and disrupting the Turkish state.
On their release, the former PYD leader pledged to remain in European Union territory and cooperate in further proceedings. The new decision meant that the Czech authorities have closed the case.
"The state attorney has halted the proceedings because the person is not within the Czech Republic's territory and thus the extradition process cannot continue," said spokesperson Stepanka Zenklova.
Muslum's lawyer Miroslav Krutina said the decision also meant their client was no longer bound by a pledge to remain in the EU.
Kelowna RCMP are investigating after a cyclist was struck at Richter St. at Harvey Ave. around 9:30 p.m. Monday.
Groceries were seen strewn across the intersection and the bike was lying in a crumpled heap.
The bike was travelling south on Richter and was struck in the eastbound lanes of Harvey by a small red car that was in the slow lane of Harvey Avenue traveling east.
Witnesses say the bicycle was pushed 10 metres across the road in the crash before coming to a stop.
The driver remained at the scene while an ambulance took the injured cyclist to Kelowna General Hospital.
Police have yet to release any information about the collision or the victim.
Heavy rainfall created dark and slick conditions in Kelowna Monday night.

How much cushier can an expedition to Antarctica or the Arctic get? Silversea's luxury Silver Explorer — an all-suite ship in which every room comes with a butler — is undergoing a major remodel during a three-week dry dock in the Caribbean.
Suites will receive new furnishings — curtains, carpets, mattresses, etc. — and add granite touches and rainforest showers to some bathrooms, a company statement says.
And it's making space for 16 new Vista and View suites on Decks 3 and 4 that will feature connecting doors for families and parties traveling together.
The ship's lounges will be upgraded with new furniture, carpets and wall treatments, and the fitness center will double in size. A blue and beige color scheme will be used throughout the ship.

When the remodel is complete, the ship will carry 144 passengers, up from 130.
The Silver Explorer began sailing to Antarctica in 2008. The ship's all-inclusive cruise includes meals, wines and spirits, an hour of free Wi-Fi each day and a butler with every suite. Excursions in Zodiac boats, walks led by experts and land lectures on destinations also are included.
Antarctica cruises start at $10,125 per person, based on double occupancy.
After renovation, the ship will sail May 20 from Lisbon, Portugal, to Honfleur, France.

Janet Jackson's best friend and creative director Gil Duldulao has two words for anyone who thinks the singer's a gold digger: “F – – k you,” they wrote on Instagram.
Reports suggested Jackson could earn up to $500 million from their split from Qatari billionaire Wissam Al Mana after their son was born.
“Even if there was a possibility that my friend could make $500 mil off of having a child. It's not in their character . . . So you f – – kers that state that — f – – k you,” they wrote.
They then tweeted: “You know how much she's worth?”
Sources said Jackson could receive $200 million. She's reportedly already worth $150 million.
A total of 897 PKK/KCK/PYD/YPG and Daesh terrorists have been killed since the start of Turkey's Operation Olive Branch in northwestern Syria, the military said Thursday.
Turkish Armed Forces carried out airstrikes overnight on the shelters, positions, arms, and equipment of the terrorists, destroying 15 more terrorist targets, according to a General Staff statement.
All the warplanes returned back to their bases after the operation, the statement added.
The Turkish military uses the term "neutralized" in reference to terrorists captured dead or alive, or those who surrendered during the operations. However, the term is usually used for the terrorists who were killed in the operations.
I'm not going to tell you how old I am, but let me just say that we who were born in 1962 occupy a very particular and narrow place in history.
There's even a term for us: “Generation Jones.” * That refers to we who were born in the very late ‘50s and very early '60s. We are too young to be Baby Boomers, and too old to be Generation X. Commentators often try to shoehorn us into either the previous or subsequent generations, but really, we belong to neither. We did not have the glorious adventures of the 1960s that true Baby Boomers had — damn them — not to mention all that money and influence. Neither did we have the cachet and “coolth” of Gen X (start date: 1965), and all the tech savvy which they are now passing on to their children.
As a result, we of Generation Jones tend to be a bitter, resentful lot. “Where is our parade?” you always hear us saying.
I quote from Wikipedia:
“[Generation Jones} is noted for coming of age after a huge swath of their older brothers and sisters in the earlier portion of the baby boomer population had come immediately preceding them; thus, many Generation Jones members complain that there was a paucity of resources and privileges available to them that were seemingly abundant to those older boomers born earlier.”
So there!
Why do I bring this up? Frankly, I don't brood over my place in history overly much, but the term “Generation Jones” did come to mind on Saturday, March 17, at Randy Bachman's concert at the Key City Theatre.
There are all sorts of ways we can bookend a season, but for me, this long tumultuous winter of 2017/18 was bracketed by the appearance in Cranbrook of Burton Cummings, in late autumn of 2017, and Randy Bachman, in the very late winter of 2018 — I will argue that these are the two signal figures of Canadian rock music.
Cummings and Bachman, of course, are old friends, colleagues, rivals and great opposites of each other. As founding members and writers in the Guess Who, they were the creative core of what is arguably song for song the greatest Canadian rock and roll band.
Bachman's tenure with the Guess Who ended in 1970 — not too amicably, by all accounts. And so that stage of the Guess Who properly belongs to the Baby Boomers. But as Generation Jones came of age musically, the big music news was Bachman's new band Bachman Turner Overdrive, followed shortly by Cummings' own departure from the Guess Who to start a solo career. In this way, they both went on to dominate the CanCon airwaves of the ‘70s, and the rock and roll reptilian brains of us of Generation Jonesers.
Thus, to see Cummings and Bachman at either end of the winter just passing was like seeing old friends. Cummings performed solo at the keyboard, Bachman was with a five-piece band (including themselves — a three guitar attack). Cummings' famous voice was in fine form; most of the vocals in Bachman's band were handled by bassist Mike Dallavee. Both Cummings and Bachman were voluable and engaged with the audience, happy to be there and at the top of their musical games. It was interesting to have heard their different perspectives on the history of some the songs they wrote together, and the adventures they had shared. Cummings revued hits from the Guess Who and their long solo career; Bachman's band roared through songs from the Guess Who, BTO and a trio of George Harrison songs — one of their musical heroes and the subject of Bachman's latest album “By George.”
All these songs, as I've said, are deeply ingrained in the musical unconscious of Generation Jones.
We of Generation Jones, being who we are, are not much for living in the past. As soon as one day is over, we are diving into the future, looking for something that belongs to either the Baby Boomers or Generation X, but not to us.
But I think a visit from the two great founding members of the Guess Who will go a long way to helping us move on in peace.
* Generation Jones is a term coined by the author Jonathan Pontell to describe those born from approximately 1954 to 1965, while other sources place the start point at 1956 or 1957.
Risky to confess such things, especially publicly, but there are a few things that get under my skin fast.
Eons ago, when I was in high school, it only took a single word. It wasn't the word itself so much as it was the tone some used saying it that suggested you were getting flipped off.
Fast forward to 2017 and I'm happy to report that it now takes two words said in any tone to bug me: fake news.
Grabbing a cab recently, the driver was well-immersed in a podcast of a national radio show where the host routinely used the term as they interviewed their guest.
My takeaway after a 10-minute ride was that it had something to do with dandelions, a medical study and Windsor, Ont.
The guest had evidently become the target of what might be called the fake-news gang of natural medicine or western medicine.
The host was sympathetic. But what really jumped out was how they nonchalantly used “fake news” in their questions, as though it had become a legitimate term to contrast opinions. I suddenly felt the crying need for that schoolyard tone from eons ago.
Once, all that was needed to dismiss a crack-pot theory was simply to say, “more people believe Elvis is still alive than would fall for that” and you would move on. But somehow we're now party to a battle between rival fake-news gangs.
It's not a term to legitimatize. It's quackery.
It's as though the phrase is some magical pixie dust that makes everything disappear that runs counter to someone's point of view.
As former U.S. senator, the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once said: “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own facts.”
But instead of checking facts, screaming “fake news” seems to suffice.
Case in point: In the ongoing debate over the Insurance Corporation of B.C. and future rate hikes, a few are advocating for private insurance. Fair enough, it's a legitimate opinion to hold. But I tweeted a reply that they should be careful what they wish for. Ontario has the highest auto insurance premiums in the land and it's 100-per-cent private.
Backing up the tweet were inter-provincial analyses of auto insurance costs prepared by the Manitoba and Saskatchewan governments, the Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Consumers' Association of Canada all of which put Ontario out front by far and all dismissed as fake news.
Evidently, someone's neighbour doesn't pay the amount cited in the reports for premiums in Alberta.
By popularizing the term, some are making it mainstream.
Earlier this year, the B.C. Liberal Party was looking for digital warriors to help that party “combat fake news.”
Former independent MLA Vicki Huntington must have signed up. How else to explain them refuting the claim that the B.C. NDP had hacked the Liberal party's website?
Someone else took issue with a New York Times article that IntegrityBC tweeted and replied “fake news.”
My response? Prove the facts are incorrect or unfollow us.
Harsh? Admittedly, not one of my more diplomatic tweets, but it's time to draw a line in the sand with those whose contribution to public debate is limited to the same two words.
When facts challenge your opinion, re-examine your opinion.
In their farewell speech, former U.S. president Barack Obama noted, “For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles … surrounded by people who share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions.
“And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence. … But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter, then we're going to keep talking past each other.”
Maybe that's why TheGoodGodAbove tweeted a new commandment: “Thou shalt stop calling everything you don't like ‘fake news!' Thou shalt attain a firmer grip on reality.”
They have a point.

Depth was a worry for the Galaxy even before the first whistle blew this season. Then came a rash of injuries that sidelined nine starters for multiple games, doing little to ease that concern.
Now comes arguably the biggest test for the team's battered roster: a run of seven games in 20 days, beginning with Wednesday's 3-1 victory over Orange County SC in the fourth round of the U.S. Open Cup.
Jack McBean's penalty-kick score in the 36th minute at the StubHub Center proved the difference, coming after an exchange of goals from the Galaxy's Jose Villarreal and Orange County's Roy Meeus in the first 26 minutes.
Ari Lassiter added an insurance goal in the 73rd minute for the Galaxy, who are unbeaten in seven games dating to April 23.
And the Galaxy's reward for the win?
Another game squeezed into the schedule, for the fifth round of the Open Cup on June 28.
“These games are important,” Galaxy coach Curt Onalfo said. “You have to utilize your roster for the next 21/2 weeks … and guys have to step up.”
In a nod to the upcoming schedule and in an effort to give playing time to bench players he'll need over the next three weeks, Onalfo started only three regulars Wednesday, then subbed on one more late in the second half.
That proved to be more than enough.
Villarreal gave the Gal-axy the lead in the 17th minute, surprising Orange County keeper Charlie Lyon by pulling up about 25 yards from the goal and unleashing a wicked shot that bent over Lyon's outstretched arm.
“That was a world-class goal,” Onalfo said.
Orange County needed only nine minutes to get that back, with Meeus, a Belgian defender, scoring from the top of the 18-yard box on a designed play. But that was as close as the United Soccer League club, the second-tier affiliate of fledgling Los Angeles FC, would get despite the fact it outshot its MLS opponent, 16-13.
The U.S. Open Cup, the oldest domestic tournament in the country and one open to teams from the top five tiers of the U.S. soccer pyramid, hasn't been kind to the Galaxy. They've advanced past the quarterfinals once in the last 10 years and haven't won the tournament since 2005.
Their difficulty with the tournament hardly sets them apart, however, because six MLS teams lost their fourth-round games this week.

Food delivery startup Deliveroo opened its first shared kitchen in Paris earlier today. Deliveroo first launched this concept of shared kitchens called Deliveroo Editions in London last year.
As the AFP reports, the company is starting with 12 kitchens in a warehouse in Saint-Ouen, right next to the north-western part of Paris. So far, 8 restaurants have agreed to make a deal with Deliveroo.
You'll find top restaurants on Deliveroo, such as Blend, Petit Cambodge, Tripletta and Santosha. Restaurants can choose to pay a rent or get started for free and pay higher fees.
Deliveroo customers currently pay €2.50 per order for the delivery in Paris. But the company also gets a cut of the total order amount — customers don't realize that Deliveroo gets a cut from both sides. It can be as much as 25 or 30 percent of what you order. It's unclear how much Deliveroo is asking for those new kitchens.
But it makes sense for restaurants that can't expand indefinitely. Deliveroo lets you accept orders without any additional table.
While there are multiple Blend or Petit Cambodge restaurants in Paris, they can't deliver everywhere around the city. But opening a new restaurant also represents a huge investment.
That's why those Deliveroo kitchens can be a good compromise. You can hire a handful of people and see if there's enough demand in the area. It's also a good way to differentiate Deliveroo from UberEats and other compatitors.
This is the first site in France. Let's see if it gets out of control like in the U.K. The Guardian reported that Deliveroo Editions are now tiny containers with no window on car parks. It gets hot in the summer, cold in the winter, and you can hear a ton of mopeds getting orders from those metal boxes.
Deliveroo first started with the idea of helping regular restaurants accept online orders — not just pizza places with existing delivery persons. But containers on a car park don't sound as attractive.

Rotherham maintained their excellent form with a home win over AFC Wimbledon.
Michael Smith's first-half goal and David Ball's late tap-in ensured the Millers made it 10 matches unbeaten.
Early pressure paid off after 14 minutes as Rotherham went ahead through Smith, who latched on to Joe Newell's clever chip to poke past George Long.
The hosts held off a good spell from Wimbledon, which saw Lyle Taylor's effort blocked, before the impressive Newell blasted over.
Matty Palmer should have marked their debut with a goal but they skewed wide an easy chance from Newell's cross.
Wimbledon still threatened and it took a good tackle by Josh Emmanuel to deny Cody McDonald a sight of goal.
Rotherham pushed for a clincher and Jon Taylor tested Long after being set up by Ball and Newell poked wide.
Wimbledon almost got leveller late on but Harry Forrester could not connect cleanly with a volley.
Rotherham then secured the win in the second minute of added time as Ball followed in from Ryan Williams' saved shot.
“I'm pretty pleased,” said Millers boss Paul Warne. “I think we've played better but we thoroughly deserve the win.
“I felt we started the game really well. It took about 15 or 20 minutes before our ‘keeper touched it.
“So, we did start really well. We pressed, got the ball back and created chances.
“It's nice to see Smudge (Michael Smith) score another goal today. I'm pleased for them and I just thought we started the game well and it sort of went a bit flat.
“We had a ten-minute flat spell then it picked up again before half time.”

Police have released an E-fit of a man they want to trace after a boat was set on fire with two people asleep inside.
Someone set fire to the canopy at the front of the boat in Aspley Marina, Huddersfield, on May 21.
A woman and man were sleeping on the boat at the time and were awoken by the fire, which they managed to put out.
While outside they spoke to a man next to the boat who told them their name was Francis and who said they were going to go search for suspects but then left the scene.
Det Con Lisa Saberton, of Huddersfield CID, said: “We are investigating this offence and are issuing an E-fit of a man we wish to speak with in connection what took place.
“The male, who was present at the scene, told the occupiers of the boat their name was Francis, and said they would search the area but disappeared.”
“He was described as white, in their late 30s, and medium build with short dark hair and appeared to have a slight accent.
“We would ask this man to come forwards or for anyone who may know their identity to contact us as we wish to speak with them in connection with what took place.”
They added: “This was clearly a very serious offence which certainly endangered the lives of the two persons aboard and caused serious damage to the boat.
“Anyone who has information is asked to contact Kirklees CID on 101 referencing crime number 13180243275. Information can also be given anonymously to the independent Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.”
A man charged with engaging in the preparation of an act of terrorism is to appear in court.
Mohammed Abbas Idris Awan, 24, of Rudding Street, Huddersfield, has also been charged with two offences of possessing a record of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.
The charges were brought after an investigation by the North East Counterterrorism Unit.
 They are due to appear before Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday.
LAHORE - Election Commission of Pakistan will start scrutiny of all nomination papers on Tuesday (today) filed by 65 contenders for by-election of NA-120 that fell vacant after disqualification of former premier Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif.
Prominent among contenders are PML-N's Kalsoom Nawaz and PTI's Dr Yasim Rashid.
The process of scrutiny will be held from August 15 to August 17. Even the period for the scrutiny is short, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, the main rival of PML-N, is planning to challenge nomination papers of Begum Kalsoom Nawaz, said sources.
However, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz has fielded Hafiz Numan as covering candidate of Begum Kalsoom Nawaz in the constituency, and is fully determined to remove both legal and political hurdles in the way.
Sarfraz Ahmad, a lawyer, had filed an application before the Election Commission of Pakistan challenging nomination papers of Kalsoom Nawaz. They argued that since the Supreme Court had decided that Nawaz Sharif is no more ‘Sadiq' and ‘Ameen', therefore , PML-N, a party which is ascribed to him, cannot be used for political purposes any longer. They asked the commission to dismiss the nomination papers of Kalsoom Nawaz on this basis.
Lahore High Court Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah last week dismissed as withdrawn a petition seeking dissolution of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz over disqualification of its president and former premier Nawaz Sharif.
Asif Aziz, a lawyer, had pleaded that PML-N be dissolved as a political party as its president had been disqualified by the Supreme Court. However, they failed to establish their argument and could not cite any law before the judge.
At this, the chief justice remarked that “disqualification of any individual does not lead to dissolution of party.” The CJ expressed dismay over filing an unnecessary petition and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000.
It may be mentioned here that the appellate tribunals would decide filed appeals till August 24 while candidates could withdraw their papers till August 25. The returning officers would publish revised list of candidates on August 26 and the by-polls would be held on September 17.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) – The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority has ramped up security around rail stations and airports, according to NFTA police chief George Gast.
“As we speak, we have tactical officers geared up and out in the system; both on the surface in the rail system and at the airports,” Gast tells News 4.
The beefed-up law enforcement presence is in response to Monday's explosion in New York City's subway system near Times Square.
Surveillance video shows the suspect, identified them as Akayed Ullah, 27, an immigrant from Bangladesh who was living in Brooklyn.
“This was an attempted terrorist attack,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio
Authorities say the suspect's abdomen and hands were burned when the crude pipe bomb went off.
Law enforcement officials tell the Associated Press that Ullah was inspired by ISIS, but had no direct contact with the terrorist group.
“This is New York. The reality is that we are a target by many who would like to make a statement against democracy, against freedom,” said Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Medaille College professor and homeland security expert Steve MacMartin says while NYC is considered a prime target, they believe this kind of lone attack can happen anywhere.
“It's generally going to happen to a soft target. It's generally going to happen to a place where there's more people congregated than less. But still it could happen in any city at any time,” said MacMartin.
“The idea of a lone attacker working by themselves. It's the most difficult thing to deal with in law enforcement,” they added.
Immediately following the NYC subway incident, NFTA police conducted a K-9 sweep of all rail stations.
NFTA police chief George Gast says enhanced security will continue for as long as necessary.
“Some of it is visible like the tactical officers, like the K-9's. And some of it is not visible when we're putting plainclothes officers and undercover officers on the trains, in the airports,” they said.
It's hard to fathom that the work of Reverend Thomas Bayes is still coming back to drive cutting edge advancements in AI, but that's exactly what's happening. DARPA-backed Gamalon is the latest carrier of the Bayesian baton, launching today with a solution to help enterprises better manage their gnarly unstructured data.
The world of enterprise is full of unstructured data. This includes product codes, SKUs, and text from sources not formally cataloged in spreadsheets. Organization opens doors for businesses to extract new insights from existing resources and processes.
Gamalon is releasing two products today for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud customers to help them with this problem. The first, Structure, converts paragraphs into structured data. The second, Match, duplicates and links these data rows.
The underlying technology powering these solutions differs from many typical machine learning approaches in the way it approaches prior knowledge. One way to think about this sort of Bayesian framework is in the context of a medical diagnosis.
Let's say someone asks a doctor what they make of their cough. The doctor contemplates and decides that the person could either have a cold or lung cancer. After all, people suffering from both typically exhibit a cough. The missing information however is that very few people walk around with lung cancer while many more have colds.
Bayesian frameworks let us take that extra dimension of information into account and update it as new data is created to build models of the world — an ideal way to think about drawing conclusions with data. An oversimplified deep learning model might just use the symptom data of thousands of hospital patients and try to extrapolate the given ailment. The reality is that the two approaches aren't quite this opposed, but the metaphor gets the idea across.
The result for Gamalon is a system that promises developers a clearer view of how models work. In contrast, deep learning models give us conclusions about data without much detail on what drives the analysis. Even still, both approaches have their ideal use cases — but historically the later has been given a lot more attention.
According to the company's founder Ben Vigoda, Gamalon is writing neural networks as probabilistic programs, building sub-routines within neural nets to combine them with other trained models.
Collections of models can be easily combined to produce better results. This modularity enables a lot of problems to be solved with fewer data. The company is capitalizing on all of this by equipping computers to build models by themselves, a differentiating factor with respect to startups like Geometric Intelligence. Ideally humans and machines can work hand-in-hand. Fortunately for the humans, this ultimately places more value on domain knowledge and less value on pure mathematical prowess.
With the competitive advantage figured out, Gamalon next turned its head to commercialization. The startup trained a version of its framework on enterprise data and gave it a home in the cloud. Beta customers can use the system self-service and Gamalon will offer some professional services if necessary. Typical early customers have been e-commerce and manufacturing businesses that have massive amounts of unstructured data originating from a wide variety of places.
“Understanding unstructured data is a problem for 90 percent of enterprise companies,” asserted Aydin Senkut, a partner at Felicis Ventures. “A ton of audit money and human time is wasted looking for anomalies that a program could learn to find.”
To date, Felicis Ventures, Boston Seed Capital and Rivas Capital have lined up alongside angels like Adam D'Angelo, Andy Bechtolsheim, Steve Blank, Ivan Chong and Georges Harik to pour $4.45 million into the company. This comes on top of $7.7 million in government R&D contracts from DARPA for a total of $12.15 million in financing.

“Fireworks produce a very distinct signal.” Prather says. “We will be able to see the bursts they produce and figure out what they're composed of. We're going to be able to determine what people have been breathing. That's important because we don't understand the air quality of San Diego as well as we should.”
Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State has urged youths, who took part in the empowerment programme organised by Ikeja Electric (IE), to turn the knowledge acquired into power.
Ambode gave the advice at the end of the two-week vocational training programme held at the Community Vocational Centre in Oshodi, Lagos.
According to the governor, knowledge is power, knowledge by itself cannot be powered without using it for a purpose.
“It is my hope that this knowledge you have acquired here will be turned into power.
“You have been empowered but if you do nothing with this new information, you will remain economically powerless,” they said.
They urged the youths who benefited from the empowerment programme to become productive citizens of the state and set up businesses in order to pay their taxes.
“Remain consistent in your enterprise and be very disciplined in your finances and you will experience growth and satisfaction beyond your dreams.
“This century is about entrepreneurs and so you need to position yourself properly.
“Do not despise the days of little beginning as the sky should be your limit. What you need to do is to bring somebody else along with you.
“That's how to spread the knowledge and power,” they said.
The governor, who was represented by their Special Adviser on Social Development, Mrs Joyce Onafowonkan, urged IE to assist the participants to set up their businesses so that they could pay taxes.
The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of IE, Mr Anthony Youdeowei, said the programme was to reduce unemployment rate in the country.
The managing director said the company remained committed to enriching lives, urging the participants to embrace the training and become models.
” At IE, we are deeply passionate about providing opportunities for Nigerian youths to hone their entrepreneurial skills through various platforms.
“We believe that there are millions of youths out there who need the right opportunity and support to develop,” they said.
One of the participants, Allen Chuks, thanked the organiser of the empowerment programme for the opportunity given to them.
” It is a life-changing experience, it has enlightened me on a lot of things and brought me to a new level.
“This is an added stream of income for me,” they said. (NAN)
DeMonaco: Everyone always asks me why didn't I direct [the fourth film] or the TV show. I've grown increasingly disturbed by this idea — there was an abstraction to the idea, and now that the abstraction is gone. Many people are saying that the Purge can become real in America — to hear that makes me very sad for our country, that we're even in a place that that can be said aloud. Do I think the Purge will happen? I don't think that we will go that far, but now when I see what's happening where we're putting little kids in jails and with the immigration crisis right now, it becomes even sadder and sadder each day.
Everyone has their least favorite parts of new parenthood. For me, it was the first night home from the hospital — when you are pretty sure someone made a huge mistake giving you a newborn— and that damn "witching hour" — the time between 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. when my son would want to breastfeed continuously or cry, leaving me feeling like a human pacifier. And then, of course, there was the first time my baby was sick. That was heartbreaking. But in my experience, the second week of motherhood will legit try to break you.
You see, when you first bring the baby home from the hospital, you are still riding high on endorphins and love hormones, people come over to help, and you still have pain medications to help with the agony that follows childbirth. But, the second week? That's when the reality of sleep deprivation, breastfeeding difficulties, loneliness, and emotional rawness really set in, at least for me. There's a reason sleep deprivation is used as a form of torture, you guys. It's effective. It's cruel. It's the damn worst.
By the second week of motherhood I was exhausted, my nipples were raw, and I was seriously depressed and feeling totally insecure in my abilities as a parent (and, well, to stay upright and semi-conscious). To make matters worse, during the second week of their lives my previously great-sleeping newborns suddenly decided that they wanted to eat or cry all night. All of this interfered with my mental health, confidence, and my relationship with my husband. Eventually it got better, though, and I eventually loved the fourth trimester. But for a while, you guys, the second week of motherhood was the worst, and here's why:
When Sleep Deprivation Catches Up With You After my babies were born, I managed to exist on caffeine and endorphins for a week or so. Then horrific sleep deprivation caught up with me, and the word "exist" completely changed. Let me tell you, everything seems worse when you are sleep deprived. A tiny slight becomes the worst insult. A small worry becomes an obsession. And for me, life became pretty unbearable. By the second week of motherhood, sleep deprivation turned me into a total emotional mess.
When It *Really* Hurts Giphy By week two, breastfeeding really freaking hurt. My nipples were raw and bloody, no matter how much nipple cream I used or which breastfeeding positions we tried. And, by then, I was out of the prescription pain medications my doctor prescribed. I totally should have saved them for nipple pain, but the baby books neglected to mention that "fun" little part about the second week of mom-life.
When Your Baby Isn't Gaining Weight All of my babies had weight-gain issues their first week of life. It was so nerve-wracking and heartbreaking to set them on the scale at the doctor's office and see that they weren't gaining weight, and all because I wasn't making enough breast milk. Or, in my son's case, they had allergies to proteins in my breast milk from things I ate. It made me feel like a failure as a parent, and the solutions seemed to only highlight that failure.
When You Are Lonely Giphy After a week, my mom went home, my husband went back to work, and people stopped visiting. I was so lonely, you guys. I felt so isolated, but I had no idea how to leave the house with a newborn.
When You Can't Figure Out Why Your Baby Is Crying Did you know that babies have growth-spurts at about 2-weeks-old? I sure didn't. I had no idea why my baby was crying, and hadn't yet learned how to interpret their cries. It seriously sucked to hear them cry and not be able to soothe them
When You Fight With Your Partner Giphy I was so emotionally raw, on edge, and depressed that I blew up at my husband for the smallest slight. Maybe they brought me the wrong burrito, or looked at me the wrong way. Maybe they did nothing at all, besides stay asleep through a late-night feeding session. We had so many ridiculous fights during the newborn period that started to make me doubt our relationship and ability to co-parent. It was the worst.
When Your Baby Won't Sleep My baby literally wouldn't sleep at night. All they wanted to do was eat or be held. It was exhausting. I felt like an object or a piece of furniture, like a pacifier, pillow, or swing. I did not feel like a mom.

Actor Arunoday Singh is happy with the growth of digital platforms for entertainment content. They say it keeps many people active and employed.Arunoday has featured in Netflix's Love Per Square Foot.Asked how they feel about the boom of digital mediums, Arunoday told IANS over phone from Mumbai: "I think it is wonderful. I think it has legitimately given so many actors legitimate work... It is not work to look down upon. It is actually good work and it keeps so many people employed and active.""The more options actors and writers have, I think it is spectacular," the 35-year-old actor added.Do they feel that the digital medium can overtake the silver screen?"There's a certain thrill to see a movie in a theatre... But if the theatre people keep over charging us, including for water, then maybe people will stay home and stream (things online). It has to be feasible to go to a theatre. If they are not careful, then digital will overtake only because of the money and the convenience," they added.
A jury has been sworn in for the trial of a young cyclist accused of running over and killing a pedestrian.
Charlie Alliston was aged 18 when they allegedly knocked down mother-of-two Kim Briggs in Old Street, east London, on February 12 last year.
They were riding a black Planet X carbon frame fixed rear pedal cycle at the time of the crash.
HR consultant Mrs Briggs, 44, had been on a lunch break when the collision happened. They died in hospital days later.
Alliston, now 20, of Trothy Road, Bermondsey, south London, has denied a charge under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act of causing bodily harm to Mrs Briggs by wanton or furious driving.
In a legal first, they also face an additional charge of the manslaughter of Mrs Briggs, of Lewisham, south London.
Prosecutor Duncan Penny, QC, told the jury: "This case involves a collision between a cyclist Charlie Alliston and a lady who was crossing Old Street in Shoreditch called Kim Briggs during their lunch hour at about 12.15pm on Friday February 12 last year.
"And the charges which arise from that are ones of manslaughter and causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving or other wilful misconduct."
Judge Wendy Joseph QC said the Old Bailey trial was expected to go on until the end of next week.
Mr Penny is expected to open the case for the prosecution on Monday afternoon.
Police responded to the Des moines County Jail just after 4 p.m. Sunday where police say a correctional officer was brutally attacked by three inmates.
The correctional staff was conducting a search of the male max security area of the jail. They had received information that inmates were making homemade "hooch" a common term for jail alcohol.
The staff did find the mixture in one of the inmate's cell and were attempting to evacuate the area to do a complete search of the individual cells.
Police say during the transition, two inmates, 24-year-old Earl Booth-Harris and 23-year-old Jorge Sanders-Galvez brutally attacked one of the correctional officers.
A third inmate, 26-year-old Bobby Morris helped in the assault by preventing another corrections officer from helping the officer who was attacked. That officer was also injured.
All three inmates have been moved from the Des Moines County Correctional Facility. Booth-Harris and Sanders-Galvez were taken to the Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison.
Morris was taken to the Oakdale Classification Center in Oakdale, Iowa.
No word on what the three will be charged with in this incident. Also, we do not know the status of the two corrections officers injured.
Earl Booth-Harris was recently convicted of 1st Degree murder for the murder of Deonte Carter.
Jorge Sanders-Galvez was recently convicted of 1st Degree murder for the murder of Kedarie Johnson.
Both were awaiting sentencing on these convictions.
Bobby Joe Morris had been convicted on Ongoing Criminal Conduct and two counts of Robbery in the 2nd Degree in reference to the 2017 multiple armed robberies of Iowa Fertilizer Plant workers.
The incident is being investigated by the Division of Criminal Investigation, and the Des Moines County Sheriff's Office.
Hackers have released more unaired episodes of popular HBO shows but the latest leak did not include anything on the hit series Game of Thrones the Associated Press reported on Sunday.The hackers, who broke into HBO's computer network and have released stolen information for several weeks, provided more unaired episodes, including the popular show Curb Your Enthusiasm, which returns in October.They also leaked episodes of "Insecure," "Ballers" and "The Deuce," according to the Associated Press.Time Warner Inc's HBO said Sunday in an emailed statement that it was "not in communication with the hacker, and we're not going to comment every time a new piece of information is released.""It has been widely reported that there was a cyber incident at HBO," it said. "The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention. That's a game we're not going to participate in."HBO acknowledged the hack earlier this summer. It said the thieves had been leaking stolen materials and asking for a multi-million-dollar ransom.The hack came at a sensitive time for HBO parent Time Warner as it awaits regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T Inc in a $85.4 billion deal announced in October.
Southgate implores England to learn from rugby counterparts

REUTERS - England's soccer team need to develop and maintain the same ruthless winning mentality as the country's rugby team, manager Gareth Southgate has said.
The England rugby team are in the midst of an unprecedented run of success under Eddie Jones, who replaced Stuart Lancaster following their early exit in the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
"It's clear they don't believe they can be beaten. That plays a huge role," Southgate told British media after Jones' side scored a late converted try to beat Wales 21-16 in Cardiff last Saturday to extend their winning streak to 16 games.
"You get a sense of the culture that's there. One of the things I was interested in was that culture," added Southgate, who has been given a similar task to revive the England soccer team after they crashed out of Euro 2016.
"How are they working? How do they deliver? Because that's what we are trying to take into the England team: how do we create an environment that will bring the best out of the players?
"Confidence plays a part. As a coach you're working out how to challenge at every moment. That said, the challenge should also come from the players themselves. Ownership of what they are doing is really important."

Iran Focus
London, 6 Oct - Donald Trump is set to introduce a new campaign to crack down on the Lebanese terrorist group, Hezbollah, which is backed by the Iranian Regime, as part of the new US policy on Iran.
Reportedly, this will include offering cash rewards for the most-wanted Hezbollah operatives, increasing efforts by the US intelligence service and law enforcement, and working with allies to undermine the group's global terror network.
Hezbollah, a powerful section of the Lebanese government, is an enemy of Israel and has been responsible for many attacks on the US and other Western countries for years. It was designated as a terror group by the US in 1997.
One administration official, who spoke to Politico on the condition of anonymity, said that the campaign's primary objective is to “expose” Hezbollah and undermine their attempts at political legitimacy.
Another source said: “It's a paradigm shift in how we view Hezbollah. While it strives for legitimacy, it is conducting terrorism.”
It is believed that this campaign will be announced at Friday's White House news briefing and would be addressed further over the coming week.
Iran Policy
The officials said that this was part of the new administration's overall policy on Iran, which will include whether or not to decertify the Iranian nuclear deal on October 15.
They believe that Trump will determine the deal as not within national security interests but would not reimpose sanctions.
One said: “We want to counter Iran's malign activities, [and Hezbollah is] “part and parcel of that [because of the group] behaves like a proxy.”
This new push was reportedly fuelled by charges filed against Samer El Debek and Ali Kourani for providing support to Hezbollah, back in June. Indeed, El Debek is believed to have conducted missions in Panama to expose vulnerabilities, while Kourani allegedly conducted surveillance in the US.
Here are just some of the attacks that Hezbollah has been accused of over the years:
• 1983: truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy and a Marine barracks in Beirut
• 1994: bombing of a Jewish cultural centre in Argentina
• 2012: the killing of five Israeli tourists in a bombing in Bulgaria
They have also gone to war with Israel several times over the years and have supported the Bashar Assad dictatorship (at the behest of Iran) in the six-year-long Syrian civil war.
When asked if Hezbollah was likely to attack the US, the officials noted that there is nothing immediate but that the problem should be taken care of before it reached that stage.
