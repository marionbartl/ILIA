A McLeod tool (or rakehoe) is a two-sided blade — one a rake with coarse tines, one a flat sharpened hoe — on a long, wooden handle. It is a standard tool during wildfire suppression and trail restoration. The combination tool was created in 1905 by Malcolm McLeod, a United States Forest Service ranger at the Sierra National Forest.
The McLeod was originally designed to rake fire lines with the teeth and cut branches and sod with the sharpened hoe edge. It is also used for finishing and maintaining hiking trails.
Common issues
Because of its large and sharp head, the McLeod is an awkward tool to transport and store, and is often considered undesirable. Some McLeod tools are made with a removable blade to partially mitigate this problem. Ideally, it is carried with the tines pointing toward the ground for safety, with a sheath over the cutting edge. The mass distribution makes it difficult to carry in this orientation consistently.

Hubert Aiwanger (born 26 January 1971) is a German politician and party leader of the Free Voters (German: Freie Wähler) since 2018 and is currently the Deputy Minister President of Bavaria and the Bavarian Minister of Economic affairs, Regional Development and Energy.  They are both the faction leader of the Federal Association of Free Voters and the Bavarian State Association of Free and Independent Voters, in addition to being the chairperson of the Federal Free Voters Party and the Free Voters of Bavaria Party. They have acted as the Party leader of the Parliamentary faction of the Free Voters of Bavaria since 2008.
Early life
Upon graduating from the Burkhart- Gymnasium in Mallersdorf-Pfaffenberg and subsequently finishing their compulsory military service, they studied agricultural sciences at the Weihenstephan College with tuition assistance from the Hanns-Seidel-Stiftung, receiving a degree in Agricultural Engineering. Aiwanger is a Roman Catholic.
Political career
Aiwanger joined the Free Voters shortly before the council elections of 2002. They ran as a candidate for the city council of Rottenburg an der Laaber, but narrowly lost the race. They then shortly thereafter rose through the party ranks, joining the regional council of Rottenburg. In 2004 they became a member of the county council in Landshut and had a brief tenure as the district chairperson
In a surprising series of events they were narrowly elected State Chairman of the Free Voters of Bavaria in a party meeting on 25 March 2006, held in Garching bei München, winning 340 votes against 322, after the previous chairperson declined to run. In October 2014 they were reelected with 92% of the vote.
At the executive elections of the Federal Association in Berlin on March 27, 2010 Aiwanger was elected federal chairperson of the Free Voters. On February 20, 2010, Hubert Aiwanger was elected to the office of the new Federal Chairman of the Federal Association of Free Voters in Münster when on October 19, 2013, they were confirmed with 88 percent of the vote. The newly founded federal association replaced the previously existing federal voter group, which was required to participate in the European elections.
Their greatest success came as a result of the 2008 elections, wherein they and the Free Voters won 10.8% of the vote, putting them past the threshold required by the Bavarian Parliament.
On October 13, 2012, they were symbolically nominated as the leading candidate of the Free Voters in Bavaria for the local state election. They ran for the constituency Landshut, earning almost 58,000 votes and in September 2013 was reelected for the second time in the state parliament. In the state election on 14 October 2018 they received in the constituency Landshut 25.0% of the first votes; with 102,691 total votes they were re-elected on the list of the constituency of Lower Bavaria.
Hubert Aiwanger has been a member of the City Council in Rottenburg an der Laaber since March 2008 and is a district council member in Landshut.
Aiwanger failed to reach their goal of leading the Free Voters to the European Parliament in 2009. However, following the successful lawsuits against the percentage hurdle, in May 2014 the Free Voters for the first time sent an MEP to the EU Parliament, Ulrike Müller.
After the 2018 state elections, they and the Free Voters joined a coalition Government with the leading CSU (Christian Social Union, German: Christlich-Soziale Union), which placed them in the governing Party for the first time. Aiwanger subsequently became the Deputy Prime Minister of Bavaria and became the Bavarian Minister of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy.
Criticisms and controversies
Criticism of leadership style
Aiwanger has been accused of lack of leadership by members of the Federal Executive, especially regarding alleged poor housekeeping of some national associations. This led to the resignation of the Federal Managing Director Cordula Breitenfellner and Judge Bernd Richter. After the designated candidate for the federal election, Stephan Werhahn, allegedly critisied Aiwanger, saying, among other things, "dictatorial leadership conditions as in Cuba", the board of Saarland demanded their resignation as federal chairperson.
The run-up to the Federal election in 2013 was met with criticism from within the Free Voters Party.
Controversies
In January and February of 2012, Aiwanger was criticised for tweeting several jokes and as a result of criticism from within their Party, they deleted their Twitter account on February 9, 2012.
Since February 2016 Aiwanger has reopened their Twitter account.
Positions
Migration and immigration policy
Aiwanger has said in the context of the refugee crisis that Germany must be "satisfied and happy" that Austria would no longer beckon refugees. They also commented positively on the fact that the Balkan route was closed, but at the same time warned against new waves of refugees. Aiwanger said that politically persecuted people must receive asylum, but they see them as "temporary guests". Aiwanger complains that the immigration policy of recent years has been poorly controlled. They subsequently advocate immigration according to the Canadian merit-based model.
EU bailouts
Aiwanger has positioned the Free Voters as a protest party against the Euro Bailout policy. Their demonstrations for this cause have been criticized by the likes of the Green Party.
Political successes
Achievements
Successful referendum campaign designed to reintroduce the G9 Gymnasium system
Aiwanger and the Free Voters successfully organized a referendum on the issue of the Gymnasium length in 2014 with the intent of reintroducing the 9 year Gymnasium in Bavaria as opposed to the 8 year Gymnasium that most states in Germany had started switching to since the early 2000s. The Free Voters succeeded in reinstituting the G9, despite opposition from the CSU, who wanted to introduce a “flexibilization year” for Gymnasium students, i.e. an optional 9th year, as well as the Greens, who simply want to improve the G8 system.
Abolition of tuition fees in higher education
From the 17th until the 30th of July 2013, the Aiwanger and the Free Voters successfully campaigned for a referendum to abolish college tuition in Bavaria. The referendum “No to school tuitions in Bavaria” (German: Nein zu Studiengebühren in Bayern) earned 14.3% of the 2013 vote. After the Bavarian Parliament approved the proposal it was implemented during the 2013/2014 school year.
Abolition of road improvements contribution taxes
Under Aiwanger's leadership, the Free Voters have also successfully abolished taxes regarding road improvement contributions (German: Straßenausbaubeiträge, shortened to Strab). This tax was paid for by homeowners on the street in which road improvement was occurring in order to finance the road maintenance. After the 1st of January, 2018, this tax was no longer levied due to the Free Voter's efforts.

The North Dakota Insurance Commissioner regulates the insurance industry in North Dakota, United States, licenses insurance professionals in the state, educates consumers about different types of insurance, and handles consumer complaints. The current Insurance Commissioner is Jon Godfread who was elected in 2016.
History
Since the creation of the office with the state's constitution in 1889, the state has seen a total of 22 Insurance Commissioners. The commissioners have served relatively short terms when compared with North Dakota's other state offices; the longest tenure was that of Sveinung A. Olsness who served for 18 years, and the average time in office has been about 6 years. The office has been held by the North Dakota Republican Party for a wide majority of its existence; only four of the 22 Insurance Commissioners were from the state's Democratic Party. The Insurance Commissioner originally served a two-year term, but this was extended to four in 1964 by a constitutional amendment.

A PCM adaptor is a device that encodes digital audio as video for recording on a videocassette recorder. The adapter also has the ability to decode a video signal back to digital audio for playback. This digital audio system was used for mastering early compact discs.
Operation
High-quality pulse-code modulation (PCM) audio requires a significantly larger bandwidth than a regular analog audio signal. For example, a 16-bit PCM signal requires an analog bandwidth of about 1-1.5 MHz compared to about 15-20 kHz of analog bandwidth required for an analog audio signal. A standard analog audio recorder cannot meet this requirement. One solution arrived at in the early 1980s was to use a videotape recorder, which is capable of recording signals with higher bandwidths.
A means of converting digital audio into a video format was necessary. Such an audio recording system includes two devices: the PCM adaptor, which converts audio into pseudo-video, and the videocassette recorder. A PCM adaptor performs an analog-to-digital conversion producing series of binary digits, which, in turn, is coded and modulated into a black and white video signal, appearing as a vibrating checkerboard pattern, which can then be recorded as a video signal.
Most video-based PCM adaptors record audio at 14 or 16 bits per sample, with a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz for PAL or monochrome NTSC, or 44.056 kHz for color NTSC. Some of the earlier models, such as the Sony PCM-100, recorded 16 bits per sample, but used only 14 of the bits for the audio, with the remaining 2 bits used for error correction for the case of dropouts or other anomalies being present on the videotape.
Sampling frequency
The use of video for the PCM adapter helps to explain the choice of sampling frequency for the CD, because the number of video lines, frame rate and bits per line end up dictating the sampling frequency one can achieve. A sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz was thus adopted for the compact disc, as at the time, there was no other practical way of storing digital audio than by using a PCM adaptor and videocassette recorder combination.
It is simplest if the same number of lines are used in each field, and, crucially, it was decided to adopt a sample rate that could be used on both PAL and monochrome NTSC equipment. Since monochrome NTSC has a field rate of 60 Hz, and PAL has a field rate of 50 Hz, their least common multiple is 300 Hz, and with 3 samples per line, this yields a sample rate that is a multiple of 900 Hz. For monochrome NTSC the sample rate is 5m × 60 × 3, where 5m is the number of active lines per field, which must be a multiple of 5 (the rest used for synchronization), and for PAL the sample rate is 6n × 50 × 3, where 6n is the number of active lines per field, which must be a multiple of 6. The sampling rates that satisfy these requirements – at least 40 kHz (to encode up to 20 kHz sounds), no more than 46.875 kHz (requiring no more than 3 samples per line in PAL), and a multiple of 900 Hz (to allow encoding in both NTSC and PAL), are thus 40.5, 41.4, 42.3, 43.2, 44.1, 45, 45.9, and 46.8 kHz. The lower ones are eliminated due to low-pass filters requiring a transition band, while the higher ones are eliminated due to some lines being required for vertical blanking interval; 44.1 kHz was the higher usable rate, and was eventually chosen.
The sampling frequencies of 44.1 and 44.056 kHz were thus the result of a need for compatibility with the 25-frame (PAL countries) and 30-frame black and white (NTSC countries) video formats used for audio storage at the time.
Video format
Audio samples are recorded as if they were on the lines of a raster scan of video, as follows: analog video standards represent video at a field rate of 60 Hz (NTSC, North America – or 60/1.001 Hz ≈ 59.94 Hz for color NTSC) or 50 Hz (PAL, Europe), which corresponds to a frame rate of 30 frames per second (frame/s) or 25 frame/s – each field is half the lines of an interlaced image (alternating the odd lines and the even lines). Each of these fields is in turn composed of lines – a frame of 625 lines for PAL and 525 lines for NTSC, though some of the "lines" are actually for synchronizing the signal, and a field comprises half the visible lines in one vertical scan. Digital audio samples are then encoded along each line, thus allowing reuse of the existing synchronization circuitry – as video, the resulting images look like lines of binary black and white (rather, gray) dots along each scan line. The line frequency (lines per second) was 15,625 Hz for PAL (625 × 50/2), 15,750 Hz for 60 Hz (monochrome) NTSC (525 × 60/2), and 15,750/1.001 Hz (approximately 15,734.26 Hz) for 59.94 (color) NTSC, and thus to record audio at the required over 40 kHz required encoding multiple samples per line, with 3 samples per line being sufficient, yielding up to 15,625 × 3 = 46,875 for PAL and 15,750 × 3 = 47,250 for NTSC. It is desirable to minimize the number of samples per line, so that each sample can have more space devoted to it, thus making it easier to have a higher bit depth (16 bits, rather than 14 or 12 bits, say) and better error tolerance, and in practice, the signal was stereo, requiring 3 × 2 = 6 samples per line. However, some of these lines are devoted to (vertical) synchronization: specifically, the lines during the vertical blanking interval (VBI) could not be used, so a maximum of 490 lines per frame (245 lines per field) could be used in NTSC, and about 588 lines per frame (294 lines per field) on PAL (Note that, in video, PAL has (up to) 575 visible lines while NTSC has up to 485).
Models
The Sony PCM-1600 was the first commercial video-based 16-bit recorder. The 1600 (and its later versions, the 1610 and 1630) used special U-matic-format (aka "3/4"" or "three-quarter") VCRs also furnished by Sony for transports, such as the BVU-200B (the first model of VCR optimized to work, and sold with, the PCM-1600 in 1979), BVU-800DA, VO-5630DA, and the later DMR-2000 and DMR-4000, which were based on the industrial VO-5850 and the broadcast BVU-800 video machines respectively. These were all in essence modified versions of existing Sony U-Matic video recorders adapted for use with the 1600-series adaptors by way of disabling the chroma and dropout compensator circuits of the VCRs, which would hinder the proper recording of the monochrome-video-based digital audio data from the 1600-series adaptors if enabled. The BVU-200B packaged with the PCM-1600 also was modified to have its video head switching point moved to the vertical blanking interval of the digital-audio-bearing video signal being recorded to prevent errors or interference with the digital audio data. Editing was accomplished by using a 1600-series adaptor and two or more of these VCRs with a DAE-3000 editing controller. The 1600-series were the first systems used for mastering audio compact discs in the early 1980s by many major record labels, with the final U-matic 1600-format digital audio tapes being sent to CD pressing plants to be recorded to a glass master disc used for making the replicated CDs.
Several semi-professional/consumer models of PCM adaptor were also released by Sony:
Sony PCM-1 (the first consumer-marketed model, introduced in 1977)
Sony PCM-F1 (which was sold with a companion Betamax-format VCR, the Sony SL-2000, SL-F1, or SL-F1E, for recording & playback)
Sony PCM-100
Sony PCM-501ES
Sony PCM-601 (included SPDIF digital audio input and output)
Sony PCM-701
Technics also made a battery-powered portable PCM adaptor, the SV-100, a hi-fi component adapter, the SV-110, and a version with a built-in VHS videocassette transport, the SV-P100. All the Technics (Panasonic) PCM adapters are limited to 14-bit resolution. Other makes and models of PCM adaptors offered on the market were the Nakamichi DMP-100, the Sharp RX-3, the Sansui PC-X1 and the Hitachi PCM-V300.
dbx, Inc. also manufactured a pseudo-video adaptor, the Model 700. It differed from the above-listed models in the fact that it did not use PCM, but rather delta-sigma modulation. This resulted in a higher quality digital recording with more dynamic range than what standard PCM modulation could offer. Like a standard PCM adaptor, the Model 700 also utilized a VCR for transport.
Obsolescence
In 1987, a few years after the PCM adaptor's introduction, Sony introduced a new cassette-based format for digital audio recording called Digital Audio Tape (DAT). Since DAT did not rely on a separate video cassette recorder, it was a much more portable and less-cumbersome format to use than a PCM adaptor-based system. DAT recorders had their own built-in transport using a small cassette unique to the format. DAT used tape in width loaded into a cassette 73 mm × 54 mm × 10.5 mm (2.87 in. x 2.12 in. x 0.41 in.) in size. The audio data was recorded to the tape by using helical scan recording, the same fashion that a VCR connected to a PCM adaptor would record to a videotape. In essence, DAT was a modernized, integrated, and miniaturized version of a PCM adaptor-based system.
Like a PCM adaptor, DAT could record only two tracks of audio at a time, but the smaller size of the equipment and media, as well as being able to accept multiple sampling rates and other flexibility, gave DAT many advantages over PCM adaptor-based systems.
Digital recorders capable of multi-track recording such as Mitsubishi's ProDigi format and Sony's DASH format also became available on the professional audio market about the same time as the introduction of PCM adaptors. Other tape-based digital audio recording systems overcame problems that made typical analog recorders unable to meet the bandwidth (frequency range) demands of digital recording by a combination of higher tape speeds, narrower head gaps used in combination with metal-formulation tapes, and the spreading of data across multiple parallel tracks.
Despite obsolescence, hobbyists are still capable of using modern-day DVDs or Blu-ray discs as a transport medium for video-based encoding of digital audio streams.

Sir Geoffrey Robert Clifton-Brown (born 23 March 1953) is a British politician serving as Member of Parliament (MP) for The Cotswolds. They also serve as vice-president of the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists and as treasurer of the 1922 Committee.
Early career
Geoffrey Clifton-Brown was born in Cambridge, elder son and eldest of four children of farmer Robert Lawrence Clifton-Brown (1929–2016), of Maltings Farmhouse, Haverhill, Suffolk, a councillor and mayor (2002) of St Edmundsbury, Suffolk, and (Florence) Elizabeth Lindsay (1926–2006), daughter of Ronald Arthur Vestey, of Great Thurlow Hall, Suffolk, DL, High Sheriff of Suffolk in 1961, and grand-daughter of Sir Edmund Hoyle Vestey, 1st Baronet. Their paternal grandfather, Lt-Col Geoffrey Benedict Clifton-Brown, late of the 12th Royal Lancers, was MP for Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk from 1945 to 1950.  They are a descendant of the Army officer and MP James Clifton Brown.
They were educated at Tormore School, in Upper Deal, Kent and then Eton College, before attending the Royal Agricultural College where they qualified as a chartered surveyor in 1975. They began their career as a graduate estate surveyor at the Property Services Agency in Dorchester and, later in 1975, became an investment surveyor with Jones Lang Wootton. They became the vice chairperson of the Norfolk North Conservative Association in 1984. They were elected as Constituency Chairman in 1986, a position they held until they resigned in 1991 in order to stand for election as a Conservative candidate.
Parliamentary career
During 1991, Clifton-Brown was selected as the candidate for the then Conservative parliamentary constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury, following the retirement of the former Cabinet minister Nicholas Ridley. They retained the seat at the 1992 general election, with a majority of 16,058, and made their maiden speech on 12 June 1992.
When newly elected they became a member of the Environment Select Committee, where they remained until 1995. Clifton-Brown was then appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Douglas Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
Later their constituency was abolished, but they contested and was elected for the newly drawn constituency of Cotswold at the 1997 general election and returned to Parliament as a backbencher, whilst William Hague was the Leader of the Opposition. After Iain Duncan Smith became leader of the Conservative party, Clifton-Brown became the Shadow Minister for Local and Devolved Government Affairs in 2002.
Following the 2005 general election, they retained the Cotswold seat and returned to Westminster as assistant Chief Conservative Whip. On the accession of David Cameron as Leader of the Conservative Party, they were appointed the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Investment.
Following the 2010 election and the formation of the subsequent Coalition government, Clifton-Brown returned to the back benches, making overseas visits in their role as Chairman of the Conservative Party's International Office. At this time they became the Parliamentary Chairman of the Conservative Friends of the Chinese. In 2014, they received critical attention in the media following a visit to China paid for by the Chinese authorities. In a 2015 interview with CNN, Clifton-Brown stated that their family has been doing business in China since the 1920s. Clifton-Brown has remained engaged in dialogue with Chinese authorities.
During the parliamentary expenses scandal in 2009, Clifton-Brown switched their main residence from their house in the Cotswolds to a London flat. The Cotswolds Conservative Party Association said that Clifton-Brown had acted within the rules.
In 2018 they were honoured as a Knight Bachelor for political and public service.
In 2019, Clifton-Brown was asked to leave the Conservative Party Conference being held in Manchester, after a dispute with security staff who prevented them from entering a meeting room with a guest who did not have a relevant identification pass. According to a BBC Online report, they later apologised and described the incident as a "minor verbal misunderstanding".
Political heritage
Clifton-Brown is related to seven other previous members of Parliament, including their grandfather Geoffrey Benedict Clifton-Brown, and also their great-uncle Douglas Clifton Brown and their son-in-law Harry Hylton-Foster (married to Audrey Clifton-Brown) who both became Speaker of the House of Commons.

According to the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA), Pakistan may have over of petroleum oil and in natural gas (including shale gas) reserves.
As per BP' Statistical Review of World Energy 2016, at the end of 2015 Pakistan had the following proved reserves of fuels: 0.9 Trillion cu m of natural gas and 2.07 Billion tons of coal (sub-bituminous and lignite).
Oil industry
Discovery
Pakistan's first gas field was found in the late 1952 in Balochistan near a giant Sui gas field. The Toot oil field was not discovered until the early 1960s in the Punjab. The Most Rich resource in Khaur Company (Attock). It covers . Pakistan Petroleum and Pakistan Oilfields explored and began drilling these field with Soviet help in 1961 and activity began in Toot during 1964.
History
The Toot area is one of the oldest oil producing regions in Pakistan with the first oilwell drilled in 1964 when President Ayub Khan encouraged a mineral development policy. It is located in Punjab Province, which area is located approximately 135 km southwest of the capital city of Islamabad. In 1964 the first well was drilled and commercial production started in 1967. There are about 60 million barrels of oil in place of which 12%-15% is recoverable. At its peak during 1986, the field was producing approximately 2,400 barrels of oil per day.
It has grown steadily since then, producing both oil and, to a lesser degree, natural gas. Oil production was entirely confined to the Punjab till 1981, when Union Texas Pakistan discovered its first oil-field in Lower Sindh. By 1998-1999, the Lower Sindh gas-fields were producing more oil than the Punjab. Since then, new deposits have also been found here.
Modern exploration
In 2005, the Vancouver-based 'International Sovereign Energy' signed a memorandum of understanding with the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited, Pakistan's national oil company, to develop the Toot field. Schlumberger Oilfield Services first started operations in early 2006. After favorable results, the Vancouver based 'Junior oil' and International 'Sovereign Energy Corp'. Oil and gas exploration companies signed a memorandum of agreement with the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited, Pakistan's national oil company, in mid-2005, to develop the Toot field in Punjab Province, near the capital city of Islamabad. The company is also providing electricity to locals living around the residential camps of Toot oil field and the neighbouring Missa Keswaal oil field.
Natural gas industry
Natural gas production is at a relatively high level and remaining reserves are estimated to be about 885.3 billion cu m (1 January 2009 est.). Pakistan's gas fields are only expected to last for about another 20 years at the most due to heavy industrial usage.
The Sui gas field is the biggest natural gas field in Pakistan. It is located near Sui in Balochistan. The gas field was discovered in the late 1952 and the commercial exploitation of the field began in 1955. Sui gas field accounts for 6% of Pakistan's gas production. Remaining reserves are estimated to be at about 800 billion cubic feet (tcf) and the daily production is around of natural. The operator of the field is Pakistan Petroleum Limited.

The Greyhound Bus Museum is located in Hibbing, Minnesota, United States, where Carl Wickman and Andrew "Bus Andy" Anderson started their first bus service in 1914 transporting fellow miners in a 1914 Hupmobile.
Company history
The Greyhound Lines was created by E.C.(Ed) Ekstrom, Carl Wickman, Andy (Bus) Anderson, and others, through a series of partnerships and mergers to become an icon, symbolizing the American dream.
Museum history
The museum opened in September 1989 in the Hibbing Municipal Building under the name Greyhound Bus Origin Center. It was the dedicated work of one man, Gene Nicolelli, a local resident, who found a plaque in the abandoned local Greyhound Terminal honoring the town as the birthplace of the bus industry. The museum has since acquired a number of buses associated with the Greyhound Line operation. The exhibits also tell the story of the company, its contribution to the World War II efforts and display memorabilia from its history.

History
Founded in 1918, Feirense played only three Primeira Liga seasons in the 20th century – 1962–63, 1977–78 and 1989–90 – being relegated in each one. In 2009–10, the club came close to ending a two-decade exile but missed out on the last day, as local rivals S.C. Beira-Mar went up with Portimonense SC.
The following year, Feirense went one better by coming second, missing out on the title on goal difference to Gil Vicente F.C. and winning promotion under Quim Machado in May 2011. However, a year later they were relegated. A four-season spell in the second tier ended with promotion in third place in May 2016, under manager José Mota.
Mota left in December 2016 and was succeeded by their assistant Nuno Manta Santos, who took the team to a best-ever eighth place. After just staying up in 2018, Feirense went down in April 2019 with four games to play.
Stadium
The Estádio Marcolino de Castro is a multi-use stadium in the town of Santa Maria da Feira. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Feirense, who play in the Portuguese Liga. The stadium is capable of holding other sporting events.

The National Federation of General Workers' Unions (, Ippan Domei) was a general union representing workers in Japan.
The union was established in 1966, and affiliated to the Japanese Confederation of Labour. By 1967, it had 84,617 members. It was a later a founding affiliate of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation. In 1995, it merged with the Japanese Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions to form the Japanese Federation of Chemical, Service and General Trade Unions.

In Western music and music theory, diminution (from Medieval Latin diminutio, alteration of Latin deminutio, decrease) has four distinct meanings. Diminution may be a form of embellishment in which a long note is divided into a series of shorter, usually melodic, values (also called "coloration"; Ger. Kolorieren). Diminution may also be the compositional device where a melody, theme or motif is presented in shorter note-values than were previously used. Diminution is also the term for the proportional shortening of the value of individual note-shapes in mensural notation, either by coloration or by a sign of proportion. A minor or perfect interval that is narrowed by a chromatic semitone is a diminished interval, and the process may be referred to as diminution (this, too, was sometimes referred to as "coloration").
Diminution as embellishment
Diminution is a form of embellishment or melodic variation in which a long note or a series of long notes is divided into shorter, usually melodic, values, as in the similar practices of breaking or division in England, passaggio in Italy, double in France and glosas or diferencias in Spain. It is thoroughly documented in written sources of the sixteenth, seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and enjoyed a remarkable flowering in Venice from about 1580–1620. It is an integral aspect of modern performance practice; Donington describes the consequences of failing to add "necessary figuration" as "disastrous".

Jacob van Eyck, Der Fluyten Lust-hof (Amsterdam, 1646) is a huge collection of diminutions.
For Heinrich Schenker, "all foreground is diminution". "All diminution must be secured firmly to the total work by means which are precisely demonstrable and organically verified by the inner necessities of the voice-leading". This conception has been essential to Schenker's theory from some of their earliest writings. In Schenkerian analysis a diminution is an elaboration by which an event formed of notes of longer value is expressed in notes of smaller value. See nonchord tone.
Diminution in composition
A melody or series of notes is diminished if the lengths of the notes are shortened; diminution is thus the opposite of augmentation, where the notes are lengthened. A melody originally consisting of four crotchets (quarter-notes) for example, is diminished if it later appears with four quavers (eighth-notes) instead. In the following theme from Beethoven's Leonora no. 3 Overture, the melodic ideas in bars 3 and 5 recur at twice the speed in bars 7-8: This technique is often used in contrapuntal music, as in the "canon by diminution" ("per diminutionem"), in which the notes in the following voice or voices are shorter than those in the leading voice, usually half the length. In jazz, Thelonious Monk's composition “Brilliant Corners” consists of a theme that is repeated at twice the speed, an effect known as “double time.”
Diminution of note values
In mensural notation, diminution of the duration of note shapes is the most common function of coloration. Diminution is most often by one-third of the note-value, so that three colored notes fit into the time of two uncolored notes of the same shape; it is thus often found in notation of triplet or hemiola figures.
Diminution may also be achieved by a sign of proportion. Thus a sign such as is in proportional notation not a modern time signature, but a proportional signature indicating diminutio sesquialtera, that is, that after the sign each three notes of the basic note value integer valor occupy the time of two such notes elsewhere in the piece, either previously in the same voice, or simultaneously in another voice.
Diminution of intervals
An interval is diminished if a minor or perfect interval is narrowed by a chromatic semitone; the process may occasionally be referred to as diminution. A diminished fifth interval is a chromatic semitone narrower than the perfect fifth, and a diminished seventh interval is a chromatic semitone narrower than the minor seventh.
The standard abbreviations for diminished intervals are dX, such that a diminished third = d3.
Diminished chords
A diminished triad consists of two superposed minor thirds, and thus contains a diminished fifth. In classical repertoire the usual symbol is the degree, °, as in vii°. In lead sheets and popular music books it is usually written Cdim or C°.
A diminished seventh chord consists of three superposed minor thirds, and thus has all successive notes a minor third apart; it contains two diminished fifths. In jazz theory, a diminished seventh chord has four available tensions, each a major ninth above the chord tones, and thus forming a diminished seventh chord a whole tone (or major ninth) above the root chord. Because any chord tone of the diminished seventh can be heard as the root, the tensions are not numbered as ninth, eleventh and so on. The usual notation is Cdim7 or C°7, but some lead sheets or popular music books may omit the 7.
A diminished triad with a minor seventh is a half-diminished chord, usually notated either Cm7(5) or Cø7. A diminished triad played over a root a major third away creates a Dominant 7th chord, notated C7, with a C Major triad on the bottom, and an E° from the chord third of C (C E G B). A minor third below would give a fully diminished 7th chord which is made entirely of minor thirds that evenly divide an octave. This even division of the octave leaves us with only three unique diminished 7th chords: C E G B, C E G B, and D F A C, as all other diminished 7th chords are inversions of one of those three.
Diminished scales
Several scales may be referred to as diminished. One of the more common is the Octatonic scale constructed from C°7 and its tensions (transposed into the same octave), which has alternating tone and semitone intervals.

The Gideon Putnam Burying Ground is located on South Franklin Street in Saratoga Springs, New York, United States. It contains over 150 graves of early and mid-19th century residents of the city, all from the period between 1812 and 1871. It was restored in the 1980s after suffering from almost a century of neglect.
Gideon Putnam was the city's founder. They built one of its first resort hotels, and laid out the grid plan that guided its subsequent development. They intended for this parcel to be used as a public cemetery, and became its first burial after their death from injuries sustained in a construction accident. Their grave is the only extant remnant of their presence in the city they founded.
Their premature death and burial meant that, apart from the Putnam family plot, it was not used much as a public cemetery since no plans or preparation had been made for that purpose. In 2003 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Property
The cemetery is on an irregularly shaped plot on the east side of South Franklin just south of Grand Avenue, opposite the Oak Street junction. It is just outside the Broadway and West Side historic districts. The neighborhood is residential, with houses across South Franklin to the west and an apartment complex on the east. A chainlink fence runs along South Franklin.
There are 161 marked graves scattered around the property, in no regular pattern. Most headstones are of marble or granite; some are unadorned and others show common 19th-century funerary art such as urn-and-willow motifs. On a rise in the north central portion is the Putnam family plot, surrounded by a fieldstone wall with smooth stone coping. Access to it is provided by a wrought iron gate with stone lintel. The graves of Gideon Putnam and their wife are marked by obelisks.
History
Putnam arrived in the area in 1789 from their native Connecticut to get into the lumber business. They soon saw the potential of the springs to attract visitors to the region, and built the first hotel, Putnam's Tavern (later the Union House) in 1802 near Congress Spring in what is today Congress Park. It was a success.
Three years later, in 1805, they bought the surrounding the spring and began laying out a plan for the village of Saratoga Springs. When published in 1810, it included the current parcel as a non-sectarian community burial ground.
The next year, Putnam fell from a scaffold while overseeing the construction of another hotel, Congress Hall. They ultimately died of complications from the injuries late in 1812 and became the burying ground's first occupant. Since it had not yet been prepared for use as a cemetery, and there was no entity to oversee its use, no plan was in place.
The Putnams continued to use it as their family plot, and allowed other local residents to be buried there with their permission. They turned it over to the village in 1835, three years after the construction of the Schenectady & Saratoga Railroad and the extension of South Franklin Street had required new boundaries on the east and west.
Burials increased in the 1830s and 1840s after it became a public graveyard. The neighborhood around it continued to grow and be developed, leaving it somewhat isolated from other open space and the village's downtown. In 1844 a new, larger public cemetery was opened on the west of the village, and burials trailed off until the last one occurred in 1871.
Maintenance declined, and within four years residents deplored the neglected condition of the cemetery, with overturned headstones and overgrown graves. A survey conducted in 1876 recorded 250 separate inscriptions, but as the neglect continued into the 20th century, the decay and vandalism took their toll. By 1922 the local Daughters of the American Revolution could identify just 89 graves.
Extensive restoration efforts in the 1980s led to the current number of graves identified. Since then it has been regularly maintained and secured.

The Socola Mică Church () is a Romanian Orthodox church located at 9 Socola Lane in Iași, Romania. It is dedicated to the Nativity of Mary, Athanasius of Alexandria and Cyril of Alexandria.
After the seminary at Socola Monastery opened and the church became a students' chapel, local residents decided to build a new church. The church was blessed in 1809, as can be read from an inscription on a small reliquary placed in the altar; a date of 1812 has also been proposed. The ktitor was the boyar Țânașa (Atanasie) Gosan, whose name gave rise to the church's second dedication. They also willed an annuity of 20 lei for candles and oil. The first parishioners were grape growers. Significant repairs were carried out in 1838. Its local significance grew when the Socola Monastery church underwent repairs, leaving it the only functioning place of worship in the area.
Made of brick on a stone foundation, the church is small in size. It is trefoil in shape, with a foyer, vestibule, nave and altar. There are two symmetrical semicircular apses, each with a narrow arched window. Other windows ensure that light streams into the building. The outside walls are plastered and lack decoration; the roof is simple, in two sections. The interior walls are not painted. There is a hexagonal spire above the foyer, with a window on each face. Throughout, the ceilings are flat, made of varnished beams. The foyer and bell tower above the entrance were rebuilt in 1995. The church underwent restorations, including painting of the whole interior, from 2006 to 2012. The iconostasis features the relics of Saints Charalambos, Pantaleon, Cosmas, with Luke the Evangelist added later.
The church is listed as a historic monument by Romania's Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs.

Alain Prochiantz (born 17 December 1948 in Paris) is a neurobiology researcher and professor at the Collège de France, of which they became director from 2015 to 2019.
Biography
Alain Prochiantz is a former student of the École normale supérieure (1969). After a science thesis obtained in 1976 in the field of genetic translation, they turned towards neurobiology by working with Jacques Glowinski and became a research fellow (1978-1981) and then research director (1982-2007) at the CNRS. They were appointed head of the Biology Department at the École normale supérieure, which they kept until 2006, when they became the holder of the "Morphogenetic Processes" chair at the Collège de France in 2007.
They have also been a member of the French Academy of Sciences since 18 November 2003 and chairperson of the Research Committee of the Foundation for Medical Research (FRM). In 2011, they received the Inserm Grand Prix de l'Inserm for all their work.
Alain Prochiantz is also the author of numerous scientific articles and books on the brain; they participate in scientific theatre productions with their friend Jean-François Peyret. Together, they are collaborating on the writing of the play Ex vivo / In vitro, premiered at the Théâtre de la Colline in November 2011.
Alain Prochiantz served as director of the Collège de France from 2015 to 2019.
Scientific contributions
Alain Prochiantz has been working since the early 1980s in the field of molecular neurobiology, particularly on the processes of morphogenesis and nerve cell differentiation. They did their first major work at the Collège de France with Jacques Glowinski on the development and in vitro maturation of dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon.
Their laboratory having moved to the École normale supérieure, they then became interested in the molecular signals responsible for certain neuronal morphogenesis processes and, in 1991, highlighted in particular the role of homeoboxes of certain transcription factors (but also of different extracellular matrix proteins such as tenascin, glycoaminoglycans...) in these phenomena.
As was then fully accepted in the scientific community, they propose that cascades of regulation of homeotic genes (of the Hox family) are potentially involved in many stages of neuronal differentiation, neurite growth, neuronal polarity... However, going against a certain number of knowledge, or even dogmas in the field of molecular biology, they report that domains of transcription factors, or even whole proteins such as Hox5, can be internalized in a cell and therefore suggests the possible secretion of a given transcription factor by a nerve cell A that can be internalized by a neighbouring cell B and have a biological effect on it. To clearly demonstrate this, they and their team are interested in the homeoprotein Engrailed of the Hox gene family involved in the morphogenesis of brain structures and demonstrate that it also has an intracellular location in secretion vesicles.
The first key publication supporting this theory was in 1998 with the in vitro demonstration that a large proportion of the nuclear transcription factor Engrailed is effectively secreted in the extracellular medium by Cos cells and recaptured by cocultured neurons acting as a potential intercellular peptide messenger. These articles were published in good biology journals but not in the forefront because the data were relatively contested by the scientific community. These discoveries will take some time to be recognized. Their team then demonstrated the involvement of Engrailed-1/2 proteins in the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons by using heterozygous mouse models (En1+/-) for them and by proposing a mechanism of action on the transcriptional activation of the Ndufs1 and Ndufs3 subunits of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.
Alain Prochiantz continues their work in evolutionary developmental genetics and directs their research towards the physiological aspects of their fundamental molecular discoveries, particularly for the understanding of neuronal plasticity and axonal guidance processes.

The Đắk Sơn Massacre was a massacre committed by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War, in the village of Đắk Sơn, Đắk Lắk Province, South Vietnam.
Prior to the attack, earlier battles had occurred between the Viet Cong and the village defence militias. On 5 December 1967, two battalions of Viet Cong attacked Dak Son village, and after a battle with the defence militia, killed between 114 and 252 civilians in a "vengeance" attack on the hamlet of Đắk Sơn, home to over 2,000 Montagnards. The Viet Cong believed that the hamlet had at one point given aid to refugees fleeing Viet Cong forces.
Troops marched into a village near Dak Son, some of whom used flamethrowers effectively. As the Viet Cong fired their weapons, people were incinerated inside their own homes, and some who had managed to escape into foxholes in their homes died of smoke inhalation. The homes that were not destroyed by flamethrowers were destroyed with grenades, and on the way out patches of the main town were set afire. Just before they left the village, the Viet Cong shot 60 of the 160 survivors. Most of the remaining villagers were taken hostage.

The article is about the stage musical. For the 1956 film, see The Catered Affair.
A Catered Affair is a musical with a book by Harvey Fierstein and music and lyrics by John Bucchino. It is based on both the 1956 film The Catered Affair written by Gore Vidal and the original 1955 teleplay by Paddy Chayefsky, set in 1953 in the Bronx. This is the first of Bucchino's scores produced on Broadway.
Production
The show premiered on September 20, 2007 at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in tryouts, with the official opening on September 30, running through November 11. The show began previews on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre on March 25, 2008 and opened officially on April 17. The production closed on July 27, 2008 after 116 performances and 27 previews. John Doyle directed the production, which stars Fierstein, Faith Prince and Tom Wopat. This production received 12 Drama Desk Award nominations, the most of any show from the 2007–08 season.
Plot synopsis
In the Bronx in 1953, young lovers Jane Hurley and Ralph Halloran decide to get married. Meanwhile, Jane's father, Tom, who owns a third-share in a taxi, agrees with one of their partners, Sam, that they will buy out the share of the third driver, Pasternak. Jane and Ralph, along with Tom and Sam, happily exclaim the virtues of partnership ("Partners"). Timing is inauspicious, since the bride's brother has just been killed in the Korean War. The couple does not want a large, expensive wedding, and Tom needs the money to buy out Pasternak. As Jane's mother Aggie announces that the upcoming wedding will be held quickly and quietly in City Hall, the neighborhood women react ("Women Chatter"). Dinner with Ralph's wealthier family leads Aggie to decide to give the couple a huge formal affair, committing them and Tom's life's savings and bereavement check to an elaborate wedding with an extensive guest list and a lavish catered reception ("Our Only Daughter"). Aggie feels guilty about having neglected Jane and sees an opportunity to plan the white wedding that they themselves never had. The bride's gay Uncle Winston, initially hurt and furious at having been left off the original guest list, becomes a support for Aggie.
Jane is initially beguiled by the attention, and happily picks out a wedding dress ("One White Dress"). But soon relationships are strained to the breaking point under the pressure of costly bridesmaids' dresses, cake layers, and each detail. Aggie confesses to Jane that they and Tom were married because they were pregnant ("Vision"), and because their father bought Tom their share in the taxi. Finally Jane and Ralph decide to call off the elaborate wedding and party and marry quietly as they had planned. The quiet and unemotional Tom finally expresses their love and caring for Aggie ("I Stayed"), and Tom and Aggie come closer together. As they get ready for the small wedding ceremony, Aggie secretly makes arrangements for Tom to buy their share of the taxi, which arrives in time for them to drive them to their daughter's wedding. Uncle Winston has the last word ("Coney Island"):
"You paid your money, took the ride, but missed the view."

Critical response
A Catered Affair received mixed reviews.
Ben Brantley for The New York Times, wrote: "From Mr. Bucchino's trickling, self-effacing score to the tight-lipped stoicism of its leading performances, from David Gallo's tidy tenement-scape set to Zachary Borovay's tentative photographic projections, this show is all pale, tasteful understatement that seems to be apologizing for asking for your attention... Ms. Prince, best known for their madcap musical turns in revivals of Guys and Dolls and Bells Are Ringing, scrubs down to raw-skinned plainness here. Them performance is tight, disciplined and at times quite affecting, never more so than when Aggie looks silently at some distant horizon of missed opportunities."
Clive Barnes, reviewing for the New York Post, wrote: "Under John Doyle's expert, discreet direction, it emerges less like a musical and more like a play with music: lovely, urban chamber music. But you won't come out humming the tunes, or even the scenery. You'll come out humming the characters."
But Linda Winer, for Newsday, wrote: "How bold to make a Broadway musical on such restrained material as A Catered Affair. How sad that the results are so glum. Despite the dedication of a fine cast...this is a colorless little piece of '50s social realism about a Bronx family that isn't so much emotionally repressed as emotionally deficient." They panned the "meandering, conversational melodies ba[c]ked by innocuous accompaniments", and the "tasteful but bland production", and concluded: "Winston, who wants the big wedding, observes, 'Resigning oneself to small is sad. Requesting it is tragic.' They could be talking about the show."

The Valour Cross () is the highest military decoration of Denmark. Established on 14 November 2011, and first awarded on 18 November 2011, it is awarded for outstanding acts of courage in combat.
Criteria
The Valour Cross is presented for extraordinary courage occurring during combat, where the soldier acted altruistically in an obviously dangerous situation. Efforts are aimed at promoting the solution of an important task or to save the lives of others. The Valour Cross is the highest Danish military decoration; it is comparable to the British Victoria Cross or the United States' Medal of Honor.
Description
The Valour Cross decoration is a silver cross pattée with a gilded edge, the lower arm being longer than the others. On the obverse in the center of the cross is a gold medallion with HM The Queen's monogram above the year 2010. Each of the four arms of the cross bear three letters each of the inscription FOR TAPPERHED (meaning "for valour"). The reverse is engraved with the name and grade of the recipient, as well as the location and year of the event for which they were honoured.
The Valour Cross is suspended from a white ribbon with a red center stripe. When worn as a ribbon bar it is the same as the Defence Medal for Bravery, but bears a miniature of the gold medallion from the center of the cross.
Recipients
Since the creation of the Valour Cross, there has been only one recipient of the decoration. This first recipient is Sergeant Casper Westphalen Mathiesen of the Engineer Regiment, based in Skive, Denmark. On 19 February 2010, while deployed to Afghanistan with ISAF, Sergeant Mathiesen risked their own life and well being to defend a wounded comrade during a firefight. Their bravery under fire is credited with holding off the enemy and allowing their comrade to receive medical assistance.

Maulana Nazar-ur-Rehman is an Islamic preacher and the current Ameer (Head) of Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan. Maulana Haji Nazur Rahman, the new leader of Tablighi Jamaat, is from village "Bilawal" of Tehsil and District Rawalpindi. This village is located on the other side of the river Swan, 10 kilometers west of Chakri from Rawalpindi. Before Pakistan Tehsil Fateh Jang was included in Campbellpur district, Maulana Nazur Rahman was born in 1929 in the house of late Hafiz Ghulam Mohiuddin, Hafiz Ghulam Mohiuddin was a pious person and one of the devotees of Hazrat Pir Meher Ali Shah. They used to go to Golra Sharif on foot to meet Pir Saheb due to limited access. The three sons of Hafiz Ghulam Mohiuddin, Haji Hafiz Fazl Hussain, Hafiz Muhammad Siddique alias Muhammad Ji and Maulana Nazarur Rahman were identified as Bamsami.
Early Life
According to the contents of Hamad Nazir Ranjha's "History and Tazikra of Khanqah Sirajiya Naqshbandiyya Mujadiya": "Maulana Nazrul Rehman received their initial education from Maulana Abdul Khaliq in Mauza Bhatral district, Rawalpindi, later from Mufti Abdul Hai Qureshi and Darul Uloom Rabbaniyya in Bhuigad. Studied higher books from Hazrat Maulana Fariduddin Qureshi. In 1949 and 1950, they completed the Daora Hadith (Learning of Hadith with Tafseer) from Sheikh Al-Hadith Maulana Sultan Mahmood Fazil Deoband and disciple Hazrat Sheikh Al-Hind Maulana Mahmood Hasan Deobandi in Madrasah Khadim Uloom Nabubuat, Kathiala Sheikhan District, Gujarat.
After completing Islamic studies, they returned to their village "Bilawal" and stayed in the village from 1950 to 1955. At that time, their elder brother Haji Hafiz Fazl Hussain was leading the village mosque. They expressed their wish to their brother Haji Hafiz Fazl Hussain that they wanted to take over the Imamate of the mosque which their brother handed over to them and their brother Haji Hafiz Fazl Hussain themselves started Imamat in a mosque near Jatli, a village of Hasal Sharif in Tehsil Gujar Khan on Khudmandara Chakwal Road.
Joining World Tableeghi Mission Center (تبلیغی مركز)
After spending four years in the village, they came to Buigarh, from there they continued to lead prayers and preach in the mosque of Taxila and DM Textile Mills Dhok Hasu Rawalpindi, from there they went to teach in Zakaria Masjid Rawalpindi, later Saying goodbye to DM Textiles. They attached themselves permanently to Zakaria mosque (west ridge, Rawalpindi) and started teaching and preaching over there for ten years they took over important responsibilities at the World Tableeghi Mission Center (تبلیغی مركز) in Raiwind, near Lahore and remain one of the first 20 members of Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan and have been performing responsibilities under the Jamaat order for a long time along with the late Haji Abdul Wahab. Late Haji Abdul Wahab had bequeathed in a will written on November 17, 2015 that after my death one of Maulana Muhammad Nazur Rahman, Maulana Ahmed Batla and Maulana Ubaidullah Khurshid should be appointed as Amir and Maulana Muhammad Nazur Rahman should lead my funeral prayer. On 20th November, 2018 Following the demise of Haji Abdul Wahab, Maulana Nazar-ur-Rehman has been appointed as new Ameer (head) of the Tableeghi Jamaat.

Guillermo Mac Millan (born 1940/1941) is a retired Chilean urologist who worked at Van Buren Hospital in Valparaíso. They carried out sex reassignment surgery on hundreds of patients over the course of their career.
Life
Mac Millan studied at the University of Chile, where they participated in heart transplantations led by Jorge Kaplán Meyer. They began practice as a urologist in 1966.
In 1976, when Mac Millan was 36 years old, a woman they had operated on for kidney cancer asked them if they could help their daughter, who was a trans woman. Using a modification of an existing technique, Mac Millan performed sex reassignment surgery on the woman's daughter. By the time a year passed, they had performed ten such surgeries, all of them for free. They initially faced criticism from colleagues, who told them that what they were doing was unnatural or immoral. They went on to become the head of Van Buren Hospital's urology department.
Between 1976 and 2019, Mac Millan carried out sex reassignment surgery on 448 to about 700 patients. They had many patients from Argentina, where genitoplasty was at one time considered a mutilation punishable by imprisonment, including Mariela Muñoz.
Retirement
Mac Millan retired in 2019 at the age of 78. At the time of their retirement, nobody in the area was qualified to replace him. Their intended replacement, Melissa Cifuentes, was still studying the specialization and was expected to begin work in September 2020. Van Buren Hospital suspended genitoplasties until that date. The local chapter of MOVILH praised Mac Millan's work and called on the Chilean Ministry of Health to train more professionals in genitoplasty.

Life
Yi Won (born 1968) is a South Korean poet. They were born in 1968 in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do, but they grew up in Seoul. They graduated from Seoul Institute of the Arts in creative writing, and afterwards they received a master's degree in creative writing from Dongguk University's Graduate School of Culture & Arts. They began their career in poetry when they published “Sigangwa binilbongji” (시간과 비닐봉지 Time and the Plastic Bag) and 4 other poems in the 1992 Fall issue of Segye-ui Munhak. In 2002 they were awarded the Contemporary Poetics Award, and in 2005 the Contemporary Poetry Award. They have published (야후!의 강물에 천개의 달이 뜬다 A Thousand Moons Rising Over the River of Yahoo!) (2001), (세상에서 가장 가벼운 오토바이 The World's Lightest Motorcycle), (불가능한 종이의 역사 The History of the Impossible Paper) (2012), and (그들이 지구를 지배했을 때 When They Ruled the Earth) (2015). Though they became known as a poet that writes about human characters in the age of technological advancement, recently they have been writing much about the underlying loneliness of humanity.
Writing
In their first poetry collection (그들이 지구를 지배했을 때 When They Ruled the Earth), Yi Won often uses the image of electronic technology, a product of digital civilization. Those images become a device to criticize the atmosphere of today's age. In their poetry, life is where people are controlled by a digital matrix and value. Yi Won describes the familiar but unfamiliar world within the digital system as ‘the electronic desert'. Them poetry showed the despair and sadness of lonely, desolate and forlorn individuals thrown in the barren ‘desert'. This type of critical mindset continues in their second poetry collection (야후!의 강물에 천개의 달이 뜬다 A Thousand Moons Rising Over the River of Yahoo!).
Among the Korean literary world of the 1990s, where there was a lot of monologue type poetry that withdrew into the inner side, Yi Won was the just about the only poet who wrote with the digital civilization in mind. Though, it is hard to consider that their works simply jumped on the development of IT technology. Them interest was in the problem of what type of existence people should lead in the age where digital civilization suddenly rose. Technological advancements offered people conveniences, but it also gave people the feeling that they were beings that drifted across the Internet, similar to data, unable to anchor onto their physical selves. Yi Won acutely captured what sensations are felt by people that have become cyborgs within such a modern society, and how they feel their physical bodies.
On the other hand, in (세상에서 가장 가벼운 오토바이 The World's Lightest Motorcycle), and (불가능한 종이의 역사 The History of the Impossible Paper), they don't directly reveal their interest on digital civilization. Instead, the poet faces the underlying loneliness of human beings, and attempts to find the meaning of existence from scars and absence.

The Story of Ruth is a 1960 American historical romance film directed by Henry Koster, shot in CinemaScope and DeLuxe Color, and released by 20th Century Fox. The screenplay, written by Norman Corwin, is an adaptation of the biblical Book of Ruth. The film stars Stuart Whitman as Boaz, Tom Tryon as Mahlon, Peggy Wood as Naomi, Viveca Lindfors as Eleilat, Jeff Morrow as Tob, and introduces 19-year old Elana Eden as Ruth.
Plot
The first part of the film revolves around Ruth, visualized as a pagan idolatress in their youth who serves as the spiritual teacher of a young Moabite girl, Tebah, who is being prepared to be sacrificed to Chemosh, a Moabite deity. Unhappy with the ritual crown created for Tebah, high-priestess Eleilat, along with Ruth, instruct Mahlon, the Judean artisan, to revamp the crown with jewels and glitter. Mahlon delivers the crown to Ruth at the temple, and they begin to question them about the existence of Chemosh. Ruth becomes doubtful of their religion and ultimately falls in love with Mahlon, sharing an interest in monotheism.
The non-biblical part ends with the sight of the Moabite girl being sacrificed, from which a distressed Ruth flees. The Moabites condemn Mahlon, their father Elimelech, and brother Chilion. Chilion and Elimelech die in the prison, while Mahlon's punishment is to work at the quarries for the rest of their life. Ruth comes to free Mahlon, but they are wounded as they flee the quarry. They marry Ruth in a cave soon afterwards, and promptly dies.
The biblical storyline begins as Naomi (who was married to Elimelech), Orpah (who was married to Chilion), and Ruth are widowed. The second part is based more on the Book of Ruth, although a subplot is added, that of the Bethlehemites' initial disapproval of Ruth's pagan past and Naomi's closest kinsman rejecting Ruth as their wife. As the next of kin after him, Boaz successfully obtains Ruth's hand in marriage. As the film concludes, the final verses of the Book of Ruth are quoted.

Myrna Fahey, who had recently signed a contract with 20th-Century Fox, was also tested. In October 1959, Cooper was cast as Ruth, changed their name from "Elana Cooper" to "Elana Eden," and signed a "term pact" with the studio.
Stephen Boyd was first cast as Boaz but later turned down the role and said: "I think the picture would be much better without me." Boyd later played Nimrod in John Huston's The Bible: In the Beginning... (1966), another biblical epic released by 20th-Century Fox. Stuart Whitman replaced Boyd as Boaz in December 1959.
Helen Hayes and Irene Dunne were offered the role of Naomi before Peggy Wood was cast.
Release
On June 17, 1960, The Story of Ruth premiered at the Paramount Theatre in New York City and on June 30, 1960, in Beverly Hills at the Fox Wilshire Theatre.
Home media
In 2006, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released The Story of Ruth on DVD with special features, including a preview, a trailer, and several Movietone News shorts concerning the film.
In 2013, the DVD was re-released with new cover art but the same features as the 2006 release.
Critical response
The Story of Ruth received favorable reviews upon release. Variety called it "a refreshingly sincere and restrained Biblical drama, a picture that elaborates on the romantic, political and devotional difficulties encountered by the Old Testament hero".
Daniel A. Poling, editor of the Christian Herald, described the film as "[g]loriously cast and faultlessly directed".
Time considered the film "commendably unepic".
Carl Lane, writing for the Evening Independent, praised Elana Eden's performance: "...a flesh and blood Ruth of passion and compassion, of tenderness and dignity, a woman of whom the viewer tells themselves on leaving the theater: 'This is Ruth as they must have been. They could have been no other.'"
Poling believed Eden's portrayal of Ruth was "worthy of an Oscar", and Variety described it as "a performance of dignity", as they project "an inner strength through a delicate veneer".
Peggy Wood's performance also received high commendation from critics. Variety noticed their "excellent characterization of Naomi" and acknowledged that their "timing is always sharp". Lane thought she: "..creates an unforgettable character. Patience, faith, wisdom, all mature within them as the story progresses."
Of both performances, Boxoffice wrote: "This personal and human tale benefits by the realistic portrayals of the beautiful Israeli actor Miss Eden and the mature Miss Wood, who play together with touching affinity."
Awards
The Story of Ruth won:
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Best Picture of the Month Award for July 1960. The bronze plaque was scheduled to be presented to producer Samuel G. Engel at the Greater Los Angeles Press Club on July 27, with director Henry Koster and stars Elana Eden and Tom Tryon also present.
The Parents' Magazine Family Award Medal for July 1960. The award was described by Movietone News as "one of the most sought-after accolades that can be awarded to film drama". Elana Eden and 20th Century Fox president Spyros Skouras attended the award presentation, which was filmed by Movietone News.
Cultural references
The story was adapted as a comic book, "Dell Four Color #1144 (September 1960)".
In Guillermo del Toro's Oscar-winning fantasy drama The Shape Of Water (2017), the Amphibian Man, spellbound, watches The Story Of Ruth in a poorly attended cinema after having escaped from an apartment above.

The Almelo–Salzbergen railway is an important Dutch and German 54 kilometre long railway line, that connects Almelo with Salzbergen, offering a rail link between the Netherlands and Germany.
History
The railway was opened by the Spoorweg-Maatschappij Almelo-Salzbergen (English: Almelo-Salzbergen railway company) on 18 October 1865, after construction had started in 1862. In Salzbergen the line connected with the Emsland Railway, which had opened in 1855.
The Dutch section of the line (Almelo–Oldenzaal) was electrified in 1951 and the remainder of the line was electrified in 1976.
From 2006 to 2009 the line through Almelo was the subject of a major project called Almelo Verdiept (Almelo Lowered), which moved the railway line through the centre of Almelo into a lowered embankment, with sections of tunnels.
Route
The railway connects Almelo in a south easterly direction with Hengelo. Before Hengelo station the line from Zutphen railway station merges into the route. After the station the line to Enschede railway station branches out in a south easterly direction. From Hengelo the line heads north east towards the former border station of Oldenzaal and heads east across the border to Bad Bentheim. Here the electric current changes, which often results in a change from a Dutch to a German locomotive. At Bad Bentheim the private freight railway to Nordhorn and Coevorden branches out, heading north. The line continues through the countryside, until the line merges with the Emsland Railway from Emden before finishing at Salzbergen.
Train services
The Almelo–Salzbergen railway is used by the following passenger services:
International services across the whole line (Amsterdam Centraal–Berlin)
Intercity services between Almelo and Hengelo (Schiphol/The Hague/Rotterdam–Enschede)
Stoptrein services between Almelo and Hengelo (Apeldoorn/Zwolle–Enschede) and Hengelo–Bad Bentheim (Zutphen–Oldenzaal, Hengelo–Bad Bentheim)
Eurobahn services between Hengelo and Salzbergen (Hengelo–Bad Bentheim–Osnabrück–Bielefeld)
Train types
A wide variety of trains can be found regularly on the Almelo–Salzbergen railway:
NS Class 1700 on the Schiphol–Berlin service between Almelo and Bad Bentheim
DB Class 101 or DB Class 120 on the Schiphol–Berlin service between Bad Bentheim and Berlin
NS Koploper on the Schiphol/The Hague/Rotterdam–Enschede service between Almelo and Hengelo
NS Sprinter on the Apeldoorn–Enschede service between Almelo and Hengelo
NS Buffel on the Zwolle–Enschede service between Almelo and Hengelo
Syntus Buffel on the Hengelo–Bad Bentheim service between Hengelo and Bad Bentheim
Syntus Lint41 on the Zutphen–Oldenzaal service between Hengelo and Oldenzaal
Stadler Flirt on the Hengelo–Bielefeld service between Bad Bentheim and Salzbergen
There are also large number of freight trains operating along the line.

Nilus the Younger, also called Neilos of Rossano (, ; 910 – 27 December 1005) was a monk, abbot, and founder of Italo-Byzantine monasticism in southern Italy.  They are venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, and their feast day is celebrated on September 26 in both the Byzantine Calendar and the Roman Martyrology.
Biography
Born to an Italian family of Byzantine rite ("Greek rite") of Rossano, in the Byzantine theme of Calabria, for a time they were married and had a daughter. Sickness brought about their conversion, however, and from that time they became a monk and a propagator of the rule of Saint Basil in Italy.
They were known for their ascetic life, their virtues, and theological learning. For a time they lived as a hermit, but their reputation drew followers to Rossano, whom they began to instruct. However, after a while, they realized that they were viewed as a local authority, and hearing that there was talk of making them bishop, Nilus fled to Capua, where they stayed for fifteen years. Later they spent certain periods of their life at various monasteries which they either founded or restored. Although Nilus instructed their monks according to the Rule of St. Basil, they maintained cordial relations with the Benedictines at Monte Cassino, where they spent some time, as well as at the Alexius monastery in Rome. The Rule of St. Basil was one of the resources Benedict had recourse to when drafting their own rule.
When Pope Gregory V (996–999) was driven out of Rome, Nilus opposed the usurpation of Philogatos of Piacenza as antipope. According to their disciple and biographer, Bartholomew, in 998 Nilus hastened to Rome to intercede on behalf of a fellow native of Rossano, John Philogathos, who had, against the advice of Nilus, cooperated in an ill-advised scheme of the Roman noble Crescentius to depose the Emperor Otto III's kinsman, Pope Gregory V. Later when Philogathos was tortured and mutilated, Nilus reproached Gregory and the Emperor for this crime, prophesying that "the curse of heaven sooner or later would affect their cruel hearts".
Nilus main works were the foundation in 1004 of the famous Greek monastery of Grottaferrata, near Frascati, on lands granted them by Gregory, count of Tusculum; they are counted the first abbot. At the time Calabria was under the Byzantine rule and was Koine Greek in language, culture, and spiritual and liturgical tradition. The abbey continues in the Byzantine rite. They spent the end of their life partly in the Sant'Agata monastery in Tusculum and partly in a hermitage at Valleluce near Gaeta. They died in the Sant'Agata monastery in 1005.
Saint Nilus is revered as the patron saint of scribes and calligraphers.

Guggulsterone is a phytosteroid found in the resin of the guggul plant, Commiphora mukul. Guggulsterone can exist as either of two stereoisomers, E-guggulsterone and Z-guggulsterone. In humans, it acts as an antagonist of the farnesoid X receptor, which was once believed to result in decreased cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Several studies have been published that indicate no overall reduction in total cholesterol occurs using various dosages of guggulsterone, and levels of low-density lipoprotein ("bad cholesterol") increased in many people. Nevertheless, guggulsterone is an ingredient in many nutritional supplements.
Guggulsterone is a broad-spectrum ligand of steroid hormone receptors, and is known to possess the following activities:
Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (Ki = 39 nM)
Progesterone receptor partial agonist (Ki = 201 nM)
Glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (Ki = 224 nM)
Androgen receptor antagonist (Ki = 240 nM)
Estrogen receptor agonist (Ki > 5 μM; EC50 > 5 μM)
Farnesoid X receptor antagonist (IC50 = 5–50 μM)
Pregnane X receptor agonist (EC50 = 2.4 μM ((Z)-isomer))
Guggulsterone has been found in animal research to be orally active; it has an absolute bioavailability of 42.9% after oral administration in rats, with a half-life of around 10 hours in this species, indicating a good pharmacokinetic profile.

Seumadu Island is located in Muara Satu, about 10 kilometers east of Lhokseumawe. This island is a tourist spot for the citizens of Lhokseumawe for whom it is easily accessible. The island is also commonly known as Rancong Beach.
Location and Transportation
Seumadu Island is located in Muara Satu, Lhokseumawe. PT Arun, the largest oil company in the Aceh province, is located approximately 12 miles from downtown Lhokseumawe along the route to Banda Aceh from Medan.
Name Origin
Seumadu Island was formerly named Rancong Beach. However it became more commonly referred to as Seumadu Island. The origin of this name change is based on a story of a husband and wife who lived in the region. The husband, Mr. Jali, was one of the first people to set up a food stall near the Rancong beach. Although others later followed their example, people began calling the beach "Seumadu", after the name of Mr. Jali's stall.
Island Tourism
The island is well known for its natural beauty and as a result attracts many tourists.
The Lhokseumawe community and surrounding areas are frequent visitors looking to enjoy its beaches. Access to the island is via a simple foot-bridge built by one of the local residents. Before the foot bridge was built, the only way to cross was by boat.

SAS Isandlwana (F146) is the second of four s for the South African Navy built by the European South African Corvette Consortium. SAS Isandlwana was named after the Battle of Isandlwana at a ceremony held in Kiel in December 2002, by Deputy Defence Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge.
Construction
SAS Isandlwana was manufactured by the European South African Corvette Consortium (ESACC), consisting of the German Frigate Consortium (Blohm+Voss, Thyssen Rheinstahl and Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft), African Defence Systems (part of the French Thales defense group) and a number of South African companies.
The ships were built to the MEKO modular design concept and are designated by the manufacturer as the MEKO A-200SAN class. Some controversy exists as to the class type of the vessel, with both the manufacturer and the South African Navy referring to them as a "corvette," but other similar vessels in other navies being referred to as frigates. Some have claimed the use of the word "corvette" was a political decision made by the South African government to ease criticism of the procurement of the vessels.
SAS Isandlwana was built at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft shipyards in Kiel, Germany, and they arrived in South Africa on 25 February 2004.
In 2007, SAS Isandlwana took part in the Atlasur Exercise in cooperation with the fleets of Brazil and Chile.
Namesake
As with all the other ships of the Valour class, Isandlwana is named after a famous South African battle or instance of great valour. In this case the famous Battle of Isandlwana between the Zulu nation and the British Empire, at the beginning of the Anglo-Zulu War.

Love Rain () is a 2012 South Korean television series directed by Yoon Seok-ho. Set in the seventies and the present day, it tells a love story over two generations, with Jang Keun-suk and Im Yoon-ah playing dual roles. It aired on KBS2 from March 26 to May 29, 2012, on Mondays and Tuesdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes.
Despite low viewership ratings in Korea, it was popular overseas and was the most expensive Korean drama presold to Japan in 2012.
Synopsis
It's love at first sight when Seo In-ha (Jang Keun-suk) and Kim Yoon-hee (Im Yoon-ah) meet as shy university students in the seventies. It takes time for the hesitant pair to finally voice their feelings, but circumstances beyond their control send them down different paths. In 2012, In-ha (Jung Jin-young) is now unhappily married to Baek Hye-jung, one of Yoon-hee's former best friends. They have never gotten over their first love, and when they run into Yoon-hee (Lee Mi-sook) after so many years, the two reconcile and look forward to making up for lost time.
In-ha's son Seo Joon (Jang Keun-suk) is a photographer, and they bump into Yoon-hee's daughter Jung Ha-na (Im Yoon-ah) by chance. Unlike their mother, Ha-na is a cheerful and vivacious girl, and though they initially find each other troublesome, even as they argue, they can't help but be drawn to each other. In search of house, they rented place at Seo Joon and started sharing their day-to-day activities together. Gradually their feelings develop, and Joon and Ha-na fall in love.
Unaware that their children are dating each other, Seo In-ha (Jung Jin-young) and Kim Yoon-hee (Lee Mi-sook) announce that they are getting married, which will make Joon and Ha-na step-siblings. As both couples deal with the shock, Joon and Ha-na struggle with sacrificing their love for their parents' long-aborted happiness. But when their parents get to know about their love they risked their relationship for their children and breakup. After some time Yoon-hee goes overseas for their eye operation with their daughter taking care of them while they and pursued their gardening career there. After some days of caring their mother they left their mother with In-ha's care, so they can again purse their relationship there without any hurdle. Seo Joon and Jung Ha-na get married with blessing of Seo Joon's mother.

Production
Love Rain reunited director Yoon Seok-ho and screenwriter Oh Soo-yeon; they previously worked together on Autumn in My Heart and Winter Sonata a decade before.
Jung Jin-young and Jang Keun-suk were costars in the films The Happy Life (2007) and The Case of Itaewon Homicide (2009). Im Yoon-ah and Yoo Hye-ri were costars in the television series You are My Destiny (2008) and Cinderella Man (2009).
Love Rain began filming on September 24, 2011. The first day's shooting for the '70s' era took place at Keimyung University in Daegu, South Korea.
The drama was featured at the MIPTV, an international event for marketing and purchasing entertainment content held in Cannes, France in April 2012.
Soundtrack
Love Rain also featured non-Korean background music, such as "Verden Vil Bedras" by Sigvart Dagsland in episode 6, and "(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story" instrumentals in episodes 1 and 3.
Also the song "Vem vet" by Swedish singer and songwriter Lisa Ekdahl is used several times during the series.
Reception
Love Rain received low ratings domestically, with an average of 5.1% nationwide.
But due to the Korean Wave appeal of its lead stars Jang and Im, of all the Korean dramas sold abroad for 2012, Love Rain went for the highest price to Japan before it was even broadcast in Korea. It cost per episode, adding up to some (or ) in total. It has since been exported to 12 countries in Asia and Europe including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia, and Singapore, recording around in overseas sales.

In it, the motion sought to ban any future broadcast of Love Rain and any subsequent production and sales of the drama and its related products. Egg Film claimed that the TV series' plot and characters were too similar to the film, specifically the themes of a couple breaking up because one chose friendship over love, and years later their children falling in love with one another.
Yoon's Color disputed the claims, stating that the themes were common to the melodrama genre, since several scenes of The Classic were also similar to Yoon Seok-ho's earlier TV dramas. They accused Egg Film of "trying to jump on the bandwagon" given the overseas success of Love Rain.
Film
Love Rain was re-edited into a two-part film which screened in Japanese theaters. The first part, composed mainly of scenes set in the 1970s, was released on September 20, 2013, while the second part, which focuses on the present day, was released on October 11, 2013. The film later aired on cable channel WOWOW in August 2014.

Medialuna ancietae is a species of sea chub native to the Pacific coast of South America where it inhabits the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp forests. It is known locally as acha, mero del sur or chino.
Description
Sea chubs are medium-sized fish with small heads, blunt snouts and laterally compressed bodies. The small mouth contains a row of short teeth with hockey-stick shaped tips. The dorsal fin is continuous and has 11 to 14 spines, which can be folded down into a groove, and 11 to 13 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and 11 to 13 soft rays. The body is clad in small scales which are thick and feel rough. The colour is mainly drab, the belly being paler than the upper parts. M. ancietae can grow to a maximum weight of .
Distribution and habitat
M. ancietae is native to the subtropical southeastern Pacific Ocean where it is found on the coasts of Peru and Chile. Its habitat is the forests of giant kelp that line the rocky shore subtidally. The dominant species of kelp along this coast are Lessonia trabeculata subtidally and Lessonia nigrescens intertidally; these can grow to a length of and provide a dense tangled environment.
Uses
Medialuna ancietae is esteemed as a sport fish and is the subject of both recreational and artisanal spear-fishing. Historically, along with Graus nigra and the Chilean sheepshead (Semicossyphus darwini), M. ancietae constituted more than 98% of the fish caught by spear-fishing. However, unregulated fishing has reduced the numbers of these fish to such an extent that by 2015, M. ancietae was rarely seen; the community structure of the kelp forest has been affected by this reduction in the populations of carnivorous fishes.

Noel Joseph Jeddore We'jitu also Newell Jeddore Gietol, Geodol (December 18, 1865 – May 14, 1944) was Saqamaw "grand chief" of the Mi'kmaq at Miawpukek in Bay d'Espoir on the south coast of Newfoundland in the Coast of Islands region. Jeddore served as chief from July 26, 1919 until they were forced into exile to Eskasoni, Nova Scotia, in 1924. They were born at Indian Point, Bay d'Espoir and they died at Eskasoni, Cape Breton.
Saqamaw
The name "Jeddore" can be traced back to We'jitu Isidore, (ca. 1656 – ca. 1769) who "was a Kji-Saqamaw or grand chief of the Mi'kmaq of the provinces of New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Quebec." Prior to the passage of the 1876 Indian Act, the Mi'kmaq were governed by the Grand Council - Santé Mawiómi - made up of representatives from the seven district councils in Mi'kma'ki. The chief of the Newfoundland Mi'kmak was Reuben Lewis, who was elected as probationary chief in 1900 following the death of Joe Bernard. In June 1907 Reuben Lewis was to "go in state with the principal men of Conn River to Sydney to be invested with the full right of chieftainship and the possession of the gold medal which is the badge of office." As chief, Noel Jeddore was given guardianship of the gold medal first given to the previous district Chief Maurice Lewis by the Grand Council. Maurice Lewis came to Miawipukek originally from Cape Breton in 1815. When they left Miawpukek Jerrold hung the medal on the statue of St. Anne near the Catholic Church. The priest, St. Croix, who deposed Chief Noel Jeddore in 1924 "was also responsible for dismantling traditional governing structures in the community."
Lewis as chief made settled disputes about territorial trapping areas and their decisions were final. Noel Jeddore was known as Saqamaw Jeddore or Geodol to the Mi'kmaq of Miawpukek/Conne River. In a 1907 publication Newfoundland and It's Untrodden Ways by Millais (1865 – 1931) the author included their favourable observations of the Jeddore family and other Conne River Mi'kmaq during their visits to Newfoundland in "two short hunting seasons in 1905-1906." Millais observed that in the absence of a Catholic priest Conne River at Christmas time, Joe Jeddore was "high priest."
Miawpukek
Miawpukek was a summer camp until Jeannot Pequidalouet - the eastern Mi'kmaq chief of Cape Breton, who had previously overwintered in Newfoundland - began to create a permanent settlement in Miawpukek from in the 1760s. In their MA thesis Butler citing Jackson described how under the leadership of Jeddore, the Mi'kmaq in the Bay D'Espoir "lived in greater isolation and so were able both to retain their language well into the twentieth century and to continue their traditional practices of living as hunter-gatherers and commercial trappers." Jackson described how, the "uninhabited wilderness of the southern interior offered an abundant variety of small game: fox, muskrat and beaver. Thousands of woodland caribou roamed the bush and barrens." Prior to the early nineteenth century Mi'kmaq lived a nomadic life moving in cycles and seasons between Newfoundland and Cape Breton. In the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century they made a transition to semi-sedentary life as hunter-gatherers living "on the country" on Newfoundland itself in permanent communities lime St. George's Bay and Miawpukek in Bay d'Espoir. In a 1907 publication Newfoundland and It's Untrodden Ways by John Guille Millais' (1865 – 1931) the author included their favourable observations of the Jeddore family and other Conne River Mi'kmaq during their visits to Newfoundland in "two short hunting seasons in 1905-1906." Like William Cormack who had undertaken an expedition in 1822 to the interior of Newfoundland with their Mi'kmaq guide Joseph Sylvester, a young Mi'kmaq hunter from Miawpukek, Bay d'Espoir, they provided details on the lives of the Newfoundland Mi'kmaq.
Newfoundland Governor William MacGregor visited Bay d'Espoir in September 1908. In their report they described how the lives of Mi'kmaq on the reserve were becoming more difficult with the encroachment of the railway, a mill and settlers which contributed to the depletion of natural resources on their traditional hunting lands. MacGregor described how the Mi'kmaq there were "hunters and trappers, and are ignorant alike of agriculture, of seamanship, and of fishing... They pay 60 to 70 cents a pound for their tobacco, 20 to 30 cents for gunpowder, and 10 cents for shot. They sell their fur locally where they make their small family purchases." Although they acknowledged that they were healthy and free of tuberculosis, resourceful, self-sufficient, "easy to govern", "seldom quarrel", with "no intoxicating liquor and seldom obtain any", they predicted that their future on the reserve was bleak. The only two cows on the reserve were owned by the Jeddore brothers. MacGregor explained that the Chieftainship was "not hereditary, but is conferred, when a vacancy occurs, on the man the people prefer."
Controversy
The Mi'kmaq at Bay d'Espoir had converted to Catholicism when an early French missionary came to the area and continued to be devout Catholics. They built the first chapel in Bay d'Espoir, Conne River in the 1870s even though there was never a regular parish priest. As chief of the Mi'kmaq, Noel Jeddore was the guardian of a prayer book watermarked in 1807 that they used for Sunday mass and other religious services - deciphering the Komqwej wi'kasikl - Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics. The prayer book which was "originally given by the missionaries and was in Mi'kmaq" - was used "firstly within the wigwam, then the village chapel and later at [St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church]."
According to Noel Jeddore's son, Peter Jeddore (May 9, 1892 – May 18, 1970), their father was exiled because of a misunderstanding with the Catholic priest, Father Stanislaus (Stanley) St. Croix, who arrived in 1916 and was based in St. Alban's as parish priest and school administrator and priest. Ethnographer Doug Jackson - who "began research in [Miaswpukek] in 1976 and lived there until 1981" - observed that St. Croix - who forbid the use of traditional language in the church and in the school, was the primary force behind the acceleration of the loss of the Mi'kmaw language in the early twentieth century. St. Croix "told teachers to strictly enforce the use of English in the classroom. Children were to be strapped if they reverted to Micmac, and they banned the use of Micmac in church.". Jackson wrote that Mi'kmaw Rod Jeddore indicated that, "the impact of intermarriage, economic climate, and Fr. St. Croix's ban on language" were "the primary reasons for the decline of Mi'kmaw language in the area and by the 1980s the language had largely disappeared." "These acts together with other forces of change (including the opening of the interior of the island and increased intermarriage with Europeans) left only three fluent speakers of Mi'kmaq in the community by the mid-1980s."
When the first regular priest Father Stanislaus St. Croix arrived in 1916 they wanted the Mi'kmaq to join their parish in St. Albans instead of holding services in their own church. St. Croix wanted the Mi'kmaq to stop saying their prayers - particularly in the church - in Mi'kmaq as they thought it "mocked God." During an impassioned community meeting in 1923 Noel Jeddore said that "if we stopped speaking Mi'kmaq in the church, there would be murder in our hearts." When community members reported this to St. Croix they interpreted it to mean that Jeddore was threatening murder. They called the RCMP and Jeddore was given the choice of going to jail or exile. They along with some community members chose to go to a Mi'kmaq reserve in Eskasoni, Cape Breton with very close ties to the Conne River community. Noel Jeddore appointed their son as Chief in the 1920s but their son refused. According to American anthropologist and University of Pennsylvania professor Frank Speck, one of their older Mi'kmaq informants described in detail how the Mi'kmaq made the sixty mile voyage across the Cabot Strait between Cape Ray on the south-western coast of Newfoundland and Cape North, Cape Breton in two days by birch bark canoes.
According to the Miawpukek First Nation, Jeddore said: "One time before they became Christians, Mi'kmaw were very strong, not even bullets could hurt them. But when they became Christian, they turned into a very weak people".

Hili is a community development block that forms an administrative division in Balurghat subdivision of Dakshin Dinajpur district in the Indian state of West Bengal.
History
Dinajpur district was constituted in 1786. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. The new Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948.

Life
Dillon was born in Hendon to Irish-born Joseph Thomas Dillon and their wife Teresa. They were one of six children, for whom their Catholic parents paid to be well educated. Carmen went to the New Hall Convent School in Chelmsford. The elder brother died during World War one, one sister became a nun and another brother emigrated. Carmen and their sisters Teresa and Agnes Dillon (known as Una) were left to fulfil their parent's ambitions for them.
Dillon initially worked as an architect and designer, and was invited to design the cover for the newly formed Electrical Association for Women.
However in 1934 they were invited to join the film industry. This built on their enthusiasm for acting and drawing. They became an art director and production designer, and won an Oscar for Laurence Olivier's 1948 film of Hamlet. It was said that for twenty-five years they were the only woman art director in the British film industry.
None of the three Dillon sisters married, and they spent 42 years together in a large flat in Kensington. Tess Dillon had led the physics department at Queen Elizabeth College. In 1985 Carmen retired to Hove with their sister Una, who had founded Dillons Booksellers. Carmen outlived their sister and died in 2000 with no survivors.

Gainesville is a ghost town located in Hancock County, Mississippi.
Formerly a thriving port on the Pearl River, the town experienced decline due to the emergence of railways in the mid-19th century. The land was acquired by NASA in 1962, later becoming home to the Stennis Space Center.
Early history
The land where Gainesville would be founded was part of the Piney Woods region, known to be used by natives for timber purposes- mainly wooden structures and canoes- carved by primitive tools from an abundance of longleaf pines. It was these same tall standing and sturdy trees that drew the attention of early European explorers to the area as a source for ship masts.
The earliest recorded European settlement of the areas was circa 1790, as a port for cotton (later timber) shipments headed downstream to New Orleans. This first settlement was known as Cottonport." Documents indicate that, in later years, the settlement was also known as "English Bluff."
Town of Gainesville
In 1810, an official Spanish land grant of approximately 500 acres was acquired by Dr. Ambrose Gaines, who subsequently named the settlement "Gainesville."
In 1813, Andrew Jackson's forces marched through Gainesville just prior to the Battle of New Orleans. The Pearl River Lumber company was founded in Gainesville in 1832, becoming the largest lumber company in the South at the time, and helping to establish Gainesville as one of the most prosperous pre-Civil War settlements in Mississippi.
The town of Gainesville was officially incorporated in 1843, and served as the seat of Hancock County for nearly a decade, until the courthouse burned.
A post office operated under the name Gainesville from 1844 to 1918.
In 1900, Gainesville had a population of 227 and was home to two churches and several stores.
The Gainesville Volunteers were organized in 1860 and made up Company G of the 3rd Mississippi Infantry of the Confederate States Army, serving at Vicksburg and Atlanta.
Decline
Gainesville began to experience decline in the latter half of the 19th Century, due largely to the emergence of railroads as a means for timber transportation. When a major rail-line bypassed the town by ten miles, residents began to leave the area in search of better jobs.
NASA
In 1961, NASA first began considering the area for a research and development center, which would later become the Stennis Space Center. Several of Gainesville's abandoned buildings were utilized by NASA in the early days of its ownership.
Legacy
The rise and fall of Gainesville is remembered as one of the more dramatic examples of post-Civil War/Industrial Revolution effects in Mississippi. The story of Gainesville's decline is one shared by many communities and towns at the time, which experienced sudden population shifts due to a growing railroad industry bypassing the once thriving settlements.
At its peak, Gainesville boasted a courthouse and numerous homes and other structures of historical significance. According to NASA's Cultural Resources Center, other elements of the town were described as:
"...a hotel called the Gainesville Exchange, a track for horse racing, one or more coffee houses, two barrooms, two drug stores, a Masonic Lodge, shops, stables, brick factories, a telegraph office, dry dock facilities, a steamboat landing, stores for distilling turpentine and other resinous products, and, of course, saw mills."
As late as 1962, many of the original buildings remained, and were utilized by NASA for various purposes, including the Rouchon House- an old fishing lodge- where the first flag-raising ceremony took place. However, today, almost none of the town's original structures remain (with some exceptions; see below section). A pictorial history of old photographs is maintained on NASA's website.
People and places
The followings are a list of documented residents and/or structures once located in Gainesville, as recorded by NASA Cultural Resources:
Acker family; homeowners, multiple properties (c. 1962)
Baptist Church (colored); Congregated by African American residents.
Baptist Church (white); Congregated by white residents; later converted by NASA into an engineering lab.
Bordage; landowner
Burke; homeowner (c. 1963)
Butler House
Carver House; built in 1865; later owned by J.H. Peterman
Davis; homeowner (c. 1959)
Grice Home
Henry; homeowner (c. 1962)
Jones Home; home of Malissa Rester Jones (c. 1962). One of the few structures that was not removed when NASA established their test facility. The U.S. Cops of Engineers used the old home as an office for a time, known then as "The Stone House." Currently, the EPA uses the structure as a conference center, now known as "The River House."
Loveless Grocery; Described in the photo caption as "...the only store in Gainesville c. 1963," however other sources indirectly contradict this assertion by mentioning the names of other stores existing around the same time period.
McQueen; homeowner (c. 1900)
Miller House; Used by NASA in the early days of its ownership; known as "The Yellow House."
Penton House
Poitevant; homeowner
Rouchon House; Site of first flag-raising ceremony following NASA acquisition.
Reinterment
Following NASA's acquisition in 1961-1962, a total of 483 existing graves were reinterred to make way for construction. Of these, 306 were relocated from the Baptist Church (white) Cemetery; 177 from the Colored Cemetery. A total of 224 graves were unmarked. A record of the names and reinterment is maintained by the Hancock County Historical Society.
Wisteria vine
A 1963 article in the Picayune Item newspaper reported NASA's effort to protect a (at the time) "75-year-old Wistaria (sic) Vine" located near the Rouchon House. Protection efforts included the erection of a fence and plaque marking the significance of the vine, which the article reports "some old timers believe may be the largest in the world" and described as "a foot thick and it has spread all over the ground and an adjacent cedar tree sixty of seventy feet tall."

Spade House was the home of the science fiction writer H. G. Wells from 1901 to 1909. It is a large mansion overlooking Sandgate, near Folkestone, in southeast England.
History
The house was designed by C.F.A. Voysey, and extended in 1903. Voysey included a signature heart shape on the door of every home they designed, but Wells rejected this in favour of a spade. Wells's two sons were born here, and while living at Spade House Wells wrote books including Kipps, Tono-Bungay and Ann Veronica.
The house has been Grade II* listed on the National Heritage List for England since March 1975. It is now occupied by the "Wells House" nursing home. At the entrance is an ornate nameplate and a blue plaque from the Sandgate Society, commemorating the link to Wells.

The animals are called "Iconicles". In every episode Nat has a problem and is helped to solve it by an Iconicle, who jumps out of the Iconi-Screen to enter the real world and interact with Nat. At some point in every episode, there is a game with questions and answers based on what happened with some of the Iconicles.
Characters
The most prominent Iconicles:
Splish and Splash (voiced by Sam Lewis and Ellie Jayne Howick): Two twin polar bears who are curious and always want to have a lot of fun.
Skitter (voiced by Tim Dann): a friendly squirrel who loves to collect acorns.
Miss Moo (voiced by Helen Lederer): a cow who has strict rules to keep everything tidy yet is very humble.
Rumple (voiced by Toby Williams): a grumpy rhino who has a big heart for other Iconicles.
Development
The show's development began as early as September 2005, and was announced to be in production by March 2006. when Foothill and Create Media Ventures announced development deals with Phuuz Entertainment for the production of the series.
In April 2007, CBeebies announced they had greenlit the series with plans for it to broadcast within a Fall 2008 delivery window. BBC Worldwide were also once involved in the production of the series.

The highest official of the subject of the Russian Federation, also known as the holder of the highest office of subject of the Russian Federation () or the head of the highest executive body of state power of the subject of the Russian Federation () and colloquially and collectively referred to as the title Governor ( - gubernator) or head of region ( - glava regiona), is the head and the chief executive of each of the federal subjects of Russia, not directly subordinate to the federal authorities, but the political and ceremonial head of the federal subject, all of which are equal constituent entities of Russia.
The office is defined by the Constitution of Russia and Chapters 1, 3 and 4 of Russia's Federal Law No. 184-FZ "On the General Principles of the Organization Of the Legislative (Representative) and Executive Organs Of State Power of the Subjects of the Russian Federation" which came into force in 1999. According to the current revision of the Russian Constitution, the Russian Federation consists of 85 federal subjects, therefore there are 85 offices of head of region in Russia (see List of current heads of federal subjects of Russia).
The certain title of office is defined by the federal subject's Constitution or Charter. The names include: Governor, President ( - president), Head of Administration ( - glava administratsii), Head of Republic ( - glava respubliki), Mayor ( - mer), non-officially and collectively referred to as Governors for short. The official title "Governor" is most used in Russia and traditionally it is used in Oblasts of Russia. Presidents of Russia's republics, mayor of Moscow and mayor of St. Petersburg are also governors in this sense.
A head of the subject in Russia is said to serve a administration or executive office, colloquially referred to as gubernatorial administration.
Role and powers
The Constitution preserves the notion that the country is a federation of semi-sovereign federal subjects and that powers not specifically granted to the federal government are retained by the federal subjects. Federal subjects, therefore, are not administrative divisions. Regional governments in Russia are relatively powerful; each federal subject has its own independent criminal and civil law codes, as well as manages its internal government.
The governor thus heads the executive branch in the federal subjects and, depending on the individual jurisdiction, may have considerable control over government budgeting, the power of appointment of many officials (including many judges), and a considerable role in legislation. The governor may also have additional roles, and in many territories the governor has partial or absolute power to commute or pardon a criminal sentence. All governors serve five-year terms for no more than two terms in a row.
In all federal subjects, the governor is directly elected, and in most cases has considerable practical powers, though this may be moderated by the legislature and in some cases by other elected executive officials.
A governor may give an annual address about their achievements in order to satisfy a constitutional stipulation that a governor must report annually (or in older constitutions described as being "from time to time") on the territory or condition of the republic/oblast. Governors of oblasts may also perform ceremonial roles, such as greeting dignitaries, conferring state decorations, issuing symbolic proclamations. The governor may also have an official residence.
History
In modern Russia, the governor - is the highest official figure in the Russian Federation (territory, region, autonomous region, city), heads the executive branch in the Republics and oblasts of the Russian Federation.
On November 30, 1991, Presidential decree of Yeltsin, appointed Boris Nemtsov to the post of governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region in and the first week of work at the new location, Nemtsov then issued a decree according to which he, the head of the regional government, is to be officially called the governor. Thus, they became the first governor of the new Russia.
From 1995 to 2005, governors were elected by the residents of the Russian Federation in the framework of direct, equal and secret ballot. From 2005 to 2012, governors were appointed by the legislative (representative) bodies of subjects of the Russian Federation by the recommendation of the President of Russia.
On June 1, 2012, an Act came into force, which returns the direct election of senior officials in the regions. In 2015, governors were restricted to a term of five years, with no more than two consecutive terms.
Demographics
Party
As of September 2021 there are 57 members of United Russia, 3 Communists, 3 Liberal Democrats, two members of A Just Russia, and 20 independents serving as governors.
Tenure
For each term, governors serve five years in office.
The longest-serving current governor is Ramzan Kadyrov, the Head of the Chechen Republic, in office since 2007. Overall longest-serving governor is Yevgeny Savchenko of Belgorod Oblast, who has served seven consecutive terms from 1993 to 2020.
Gender
The first female governor was Valentina Bronevich who was governor of Koryak Autonomous Okrug from 1996 to 2000. There are currently 84 male state governors and one female governor: Natalya Komarova of Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug.

"Cheyenne" is a song by American singer Jason Derulo, released as the second single for their fourth studio album, Everything Is 4 (2015). The song was written by Jason Derulo, Ian Kirkpatrick, Sam Martin, Lindy Robbins, Jason Evigan, Marcus Lomax, Stefan Johnson and Jordan Johnson, while the song's production was handled by The Monsters and the Strangerz and Kirkpatrick.
Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted the reminiscence of "Cheyenne" to the works by singer Bruno Mars.
Music video
The song's accompanying music video, directed by Syndrome, premiered via Derulo's YouTube channel on June 30, 2015.
The video begins in a mansion where Derulo is seen waking up tied to a chair and glued to the wall. Cheyenne is approaching them as Derulo falls through to a bed where two hands grabbed them as Cheyenne starts frightening sex with Derulo. Then, Derulo ends up in the table as a demon version of Derulo is seen sitting in front of him. Cheyenne kisses the demon Derulo, causing the real Derulo to lift the table. They then finds themselves one floor below Cheyenne, but the floor collapses and Cheyenne walks away. Derulo jumps over the gap, looks for Cheyenne and ends up in the bedroom. This is intercut with scenes of Derulo wearing a purple suit and a hat, now Cheyenne activates zombified princess dancers which surround them and they break into an elaborate dance. Meanwhile, Derulo brings pictures of Cheyenne up which are set on fire. The video ends with Derulo on the chair looking at the burned photograph as it ends with a few images of Cheyenne's dark eye.
Derulo describes the character Cheyenne as a "woman in a red dress [that] haunts" him, as seen in the video.

Dipodoidea is a superfamily of rodents, also known as dipodoids, found across the Northern Hemisphere. This superfamily includes over 50 species among the 16 genera in 3 families. They include the jerboas (family Dipodidae), jumping mice (family Zapodidae), and birch mice (family Sminthidae). Different species are found in grassland, deserts, and forests. They are all capable of saltation (jumping while in a bipedal stance), a feature that is most highly evolved in the desert-dwelling jerboas.
Taxonomy
Formerly, Dipodoidea contained only a single large family, Dipodidae, which contained jerboas, jumping mice, and birch mice as subfamilies. However, phylogenetic evidence found all three to be distinct families from one another, and thus they were split into three different families within Dipodoidea.
Characteristics
Dipodoids are small to medium-sized rodents, ranging from in body length, excluding the tail. They are all adapted for jumping, although to varying degrees. The jerboas have very long hind legs which, in most species, include cannon bones. They move either by jumping, or by walking on their hind legs. The jumping mice have long feet, but lack the extreme adaptations of the jerboas, so that they move by crawling or making short hops, rather than long leaps. Both jerboas and jumping mice have long tails to aid their balance. Birch mice have shorter tails and feet, but they, too, move by jumping.
Most dipodoids are omnivorous, with a diet consisting of seeds and insects. Some species of jerboa, however, such as Allactaga sibirica, are almost entirely insectivorous. Like other rodents, they have gnawing incisors separated from the grinding cheek teeth by a gap, or diastema. The dental formula for dipodids is:
Jerboas and birch mice make their nests in burrows, which, in the case of jerboas, may be complex, with side-chambers for storage of food. In contrast, while jumping mice sometimes co-opt the burrows of other species, they do not dig their own, and generally nest in thick vegetation. Most species hibernate for at least half the year, surviving on fat that they build up in the weeks prior to going to sleep.
Dipodoids give birth to litters of between two and seven young after a gestation period of between 17 and 42 days. They breed once or twice a year, depending on the species.

The Cheeky Girls are a Romanian singing duo consisting of identical twin sisters Gabriela and Monica Irimia (both born 31 October 1982). After appearing as auditionees on Popstars: The Rivals, they achieved success in the UK charts with four top 10 hits between 2002 and 2004. They are best known for their debut single, "Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum)", which has sold more than 1.2 million units internationally. The Cheeky Girls released their debut studio album, PartyTime, in 2003 which reached number 14 in the UK Albums Chart.
Biography
Gabriela and Monica were born on 31 October 1982 to Doru and Margit Irimia. Gabriela is older by 10 minutes. Their early life in Romania consisted of studying gymnastics and ballet and touring with the Hungarian National Opera. Moving to the United Kingdom with their mother in 2002, the girls shot to fame as the Cheeky Girls after auditioning on two British TV shows, Channel 4's Model Behaviour and more importantly Popstars: The Rivals. Following two appearances on the show with their audition, which had judges Pete Waterman and Louis Walsh not knowing what to say – Waterman was later quoted as saying they were the worst act ever – various record companies approached the Granada Press Office. The Press Office contacted Paul Holland at Granada Ventures, who was able to secure them a deal with the Multiply label, part of Telstar Records. "Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum)" was swiftly recorded and released in the first week in December. Entering the chart at number two, the single remained in the top five for five consecutive weeks, four of them at number two.
This was quickly followed up with two more top three hits, "Take Your Shoes Off" and "(Hooray, Hooray!) It's a Cheeky Holiday!". Their style of music is primarily disco-pop, aimed at the pre-teen market. Most of their songs are written by their mother, who also acts as their manager.
On 4 August 2006, the Evening Standard reported that the Cheeky Girls were "at rock bottom" and facing bankruptcy action in court owing to not having been paid by their now-defunct record company, Telstar Records. The article said that the women owed £4,500 in unpaid taxes, along with other bills, and that Telstar owed them £2.2 million. Later, it was reported that they owed £130,000 in total.
In September 2009, the act released their Cheeky Girls make-up range, aimed at the young teen market.
On 7 March 2013, the women appeared on the Week BBC TV programme discussing the subject of Romanian immigration to the UK with host Andrew Neil. This followed a short video report by Monica talking about British fears of an invasion of benefit-seekers from their homeland. They previously appeared on the show on 10 July 2008.
Personal lives
In December 2006, it was revealed by the tabloids that former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik had broken up with long-time fiancée, ITV weather presenter Siân Lloyd, and was now romantically involved with Gabriela. Öpik "passed documentation on to the singers' constituency MP and spoke to a Home Office minister," when the Irimias were facing deportation to Romania. The couple announced their engagement in April 2008 after Öpik proposed in Rome, but the engagement was short lived and a breakup was announced three months later.
In 2016, Monica married their fiancé of four years, Shaun Taylor, who works as a building contractor.

The Iron and Steel Act 1949 (12 & 13 Geo. 6. c. 72) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which nationalised, or bought into state control, elements of the iron and steel industry in Great Britain. It established an Iron and Steel Corporation which acquired certain iron and steel companies. In a departure from earlier nationalisations the Corporation only acquired the share capital of the companies, not the undertakings themselves. The individual companies continued to operate under management Boards appointed by the corporation. The Iron and Steel Act 1949 was one of a number of Acts promulgated by the post-war Labour government to nationalise elements of the UK's industrial infrastructure; other Acts include the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946; the Electricity Act 1947; Transport Act 1947 (railways and long-distance road haulage); and the Gas Act 1948.
Background
The involvement of the UK government in the iron and steel industry began in the interwar period with the establishment of the British Iron and Steel Federation to represent companies in the industry, and which fixed prices, production quotas, levies, and closed redundant works under Government supervision.
The iron and steel industry came under the control of the Ministry of Supply during the Second World War.
In 1945 the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Sir Oliver Franks, published a report on the future of the industry. Franks recommended a radical modernisation with the aim of reducing prices to keep British steel competitive on the world market. In 1946 the Labour government established an Iron and Steel Board, to control the price of raw materials, finished products, and steel imports; and to regulate investment, pooling arrangements, and the development of new plant and equipment. Board members were appointed by the Minister of Supply and represented industry employers, workers and consumers. Full nationalisation of the industry, as opposed to government control, had been pledged by the incoming Labour government in 1945; however, this was a controversial issue and was opposed by the iron and steel companies and by the Conservative opposition.
Provisions of the Bill
The Iron and Steel Bill as first drafted comprised 46 sections under 8 headings.
National Iron and Steel Board
Sections 1–4: Establishment of the National Iron and Steel Board; its constitution and appointment by the Minister of Supply; its duties; permitted activities; power to establish and liquidate its companies.
Powers of the Minister in relation to the Board
Sections 5–8: General directions; framing of programmes; annual reports and accounts; consultation on the acquisition and disposing of undertakings,
Registration and Licensing of Iron and Steel Undertakings
Sections 9–11: Undertakings to register with the Minister; calling for information; requirement to have a license,
Acquisition of Undertakings by the Board
Sections 12–22: Acquisition notices; securities; representation of shareholders; rights of transferred companies to continue to use assets; efficient operation; limitation of dividends,
Terms of Purchase
Sections 23–25: Compensation for transferred assets,
Financial Provisions
Sections 26–35: Borrowing and raising money; creating and issuing of stock; reserve fund; accounts and annual statement,
Arbitration Tribunal
Sections 36–38: Establishment of tribunal; remuneration; enforcement Orders,
Miscellaneous and General
Sections 39–46: Acquisition of land; terms and conditions of employment; making of Regulations; prohibition of iron ore import; liabilities and penalties; interpretation; application to Northern Ireland.
During the passage of the Bill through Parliament the proposed Iron and Steel Board became the Iron and Steel Corporation.
Enactment and provisions
The Iron and Steel Act 1949 (12 & 13 Geo. 6. c. 72) received Royal Assent on 24 November 1949.
The Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain was established under the provisions of the Act with effect from October 1950. It brought 94 iron and steel companies into public ownership with effect from vesting day, the 15 February 1951.
The 1949 Act also established an Iron and Steel Consumers' Council. This had the duty ‘of making representations to the Minister on such matters affecting the interests of the consumers as the Council think necessary'.
Operation of the Act
The model of nationalisation enacted by the 1949 Act was different to earlier ones, such as Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946. Only the share capital of the companies was acquired, not the undertakings themselves. The individual companies therefore continued to operate under management Boards appointed by the corporation. The mode of nationalisation was distinct because many iron and steel companies undertook other integrated activities, that could not easily be segregated into their individual functions. For example, the manufacturers of motor vehicles, which undertook steel processing, were excluded. About 2,000 iron and steel companies operated outside the nationalised sector.
Observations on the Act
The 1949 Act has been seen as both the culmination of the Labour government's nationalisation policy and as a major departure from that policy. It completed the list of major industrial infrastructures to be brought into state control and introduced collective ownership, and a certain amount of competition, into a manufacturing industry. It has also been seen as significant as it 'sheds light on the policy of nationalisation'. It has been described as being doctrinally inspired. And 'a highly exceptional measure... pushed through Parliament with great vigour and determination'. It has been seen as ‘nationalisation for clearly ideological reasons'; since the government 'was so persistent with a measure which can fairly be described as in no way popular'. It was argued that the iron and steel industry was progressive and efficient with good labour relations. And that public ownership was necessary to compel the industry to follow a policy in the national interest. Although different to the nationalisation of the coal, transport, electricity and gas industries the method of nationalisation through the acquisition of shares was similar to that used for the Bank of England (1946) and Cable and Wireless Limited (1947).
Government policy and later enactments
Nationalisation of iron and steel production had been strongly opposed by the Conservative opposition. The act went into effect in February 1951, meaning that its implementation would occur during the 1951 general election season. On returning to power in October 1951 they planned to denationalise and return the industry to the private sector. This policy was enacted through the Iron and Steel Act 1953.
The Iron and Steel Act 1953 (1 & 2 Eliz. 2 c. 15) received Royal Assent on 14 May 1953.
Section 1 of the 1953 Act repealed the Iron and Steel Act 1949 and dissolved the Iron and Steel Corporation. It transferred the corporation's properties, rights, liabilities and obligations to a newly established Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency. The Agency gradually sold the nationalised companies back into the private sector with the exception of Richard Thomas and Baldwins which remained in public ownership until it was absorbed into the British Steel Corporation in 1967.
The 1953 act also established a new Iron and Steel Board which began operating on 13 July 1953. The Board had a duty 'to exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry... with a view to promoting the efficient, economic and adequate supply, under competitive conditions, of iron and steel products'. The work of the Board and the Agency was thus parallel and complementary.
The 1953 Act remained in force until the Labour government re-nationalised the iron and steel industry in 1967 through the Iron and Steel Act 1967.

Caroline Winnett is the Executive Director of the Berkeley SkyDeck startup accelerator at the University of California, Berkeley.  They are a serial entrepreneur, civic activist, angel investor, advisor and board member of several startups, and a frequent speaker on startups, accelerators, women in business and consumer neuroscience.
Education
Winnett attended Brown University as an undergraduate and got their violin performance degree in 1984 from the Indiana University School of Music.
In 1990, Winnett earned their MBA from the Berkeley Haas School of Business. In a 2018 interview, Winnett said that they created their own major in Entrepreneurial Operations because at that time there were no programs at Berkleley for entrepreneurs.
Civic activism and Berkeley landmarks
Save Berkeley Iceland
In 2008, Winnett was a founder and spokesperson for Save Berkeley Iceland, advocating for the preservation of the 67-year old Olympic-sized historical ice rink in Berkeley, California. They appeared on local NBC News to raise donations and also petitioned the city council. Winnett and the group were able to raise $50,000 and advocated turning the rink into a nonprofit, but in the end were not able to save the rink from closure.
SkyDeck signage petition
In July 2017, Winnett successfully petitioned the Berkeley city council after a 10-month review process to approve signage on the tallest building in downtown Berkeley, formerly known as the PowerBar building or the Chase Building due to previous signage. The highly-debated building signage named the building "SkyDeck" after Winnett's nonprofit organization, the Berkeley SkyDeck accelerator located on the penthouse floor. Those opposed to the petition argued that the signage was "advertising" and not architectural, while advocates including Winnett argued that the name SkyDeck reflected the Berkeley spirit of innovation. In the end the SkyDeck Building petition was unanimously approved by the council.
Career
NeuroFocus
In 2006, Winnett co-founded startup NeuroFocus, a company that measures how consumers react to advertising using neurological measurements using EEG sensors. Nielsen Holdings acquired NeuroFocus in 2011.
UC Berkeley SkyDeck
Winnett joined Berkeley SkyDeck as executive director in 2015, three years after its original founding as a mentoring space. As the new director, Winnett added staff and worked to partner with the resources already in place at Berkeley. With a colleague, Winnett helped to secure a $150,000 grant to build The Berkeley Startup Network platform so that startup resources at Berkeley would be accessible in one place. In a 2018 interview with Xconomy, Winnett noted that the number of SkyDeck startup advisors had increased from 30 to 140, and that the penthouse accelerator had also taken over an additional floor of the high-rise building it was housed in, located next to Berkeley campus.
In Spring 2018, Winnett and SkyDeck raised a $24 million oversubscribed venture fund from investors Sequoia Capital, Mayfield, Sierra Ventures and others. Managed by Winnett's colleague Chon Tang, the Berkeley SkyDeck Fund began offering $100,000 each to startups in return for 5 percent ownership, beginning with a cohort of 20. In a 2019 blog, Winnett expressed a goal that the Berkeley SkyDeck Fund would bring $1 billion in revenue to UC Berkeley in the future.
Cal Performances
Winnett also serves on the Board of Trustees for Cal Performances, a UC Berkeley performing arts organization.
Public Speaking
Winnett was the opening speaker at the 2020 Taiwan-US Innovation Forum, and urged companies in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic environment to "focus on the basics", "don't be afraid to change course", and "look for new opportunities". Winnett has also spoken at venues such as the Milan Innovation District and the Rhodes House at the University of Oxford talking about the future of work and innovation.

Manolo Álvarez Mera (né Manuel Ernesto Álvarez-Mera 7 November 1923 Havana, Cuba – 16 October 1986 New York City) was a Cuban-born tenor who flourished as a bel canto during the late 1940s and 1950s. Despite having an operatic caliber voice, they gained popularity singing in operettas, musical reviews, radio, television, vaudeville, and major night clubs in Cuba, New York, and Latin America. They became a Cuban exile in 1960 after the Cuban Revolution.
Career
Cuba
Álvarez was born November 7, 1923, to Beniana (née Mera) and Manuel Alvarez in the Luyanó neighborhood of Diez de Octubre, Havana, Cuba. After formally studying voice in Havana, Álvarez performed for the first time in public at the Teatro Principal de la Comedia (Main Theater of Comedy) in Havana in 1943, singing the role of Niño Fernando in , a one act zarzuela, a characteristically Spanish genre of lyric and dramatic theatre. The lyrics were by Gustavo Sánchez Galarraga (1893–1934) and the music by Ernesto Lecuona. Maruja González (1904–1999) sang the soprano role of Mary la O. They went on in 1944 to perform at the Teatro Lírico Cubano (Lyric Theater of Cuba), singing in La Plaza de la Catedral (The Cathedral Square), a zarzuela by Lecuona. They sang the same work for radio stations RHC-Cadena Azul and CMQ.
They then performed in several zarzuelas, including Luisa Fernanda, , , La dolorosa, and Cecilia Valdés, which also included singers Maruja Montes (1930–1993), Rosita Fornés (born 1943), Zoraida Marrero (1911–2004), Esther Borja (1913–2013), Sarita Escarpentier (born 1925), Dorini de Diso (1901–1948), Miguel de Grandy, Antonio Palacios, Jesús Freyre, and (1911–1978).

Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay
In 1952, Álvarez toured Chile including visits to Buenos Aires and Montevideo. Their performances were acclaimed by the Cuban magazine, .
In their Uruguay radio concerts, Álvarez was hailed "Sir Hyperbole!" Many of their interpretations, including María la O; Granada by Agustín Lara; and Ay-Ay-Ay by Osmán Pérez Freire, were interrupted with applause, and they were forced to repeat them three or four times. The night of the farewell, as they went on stage, the audience — more than two thousand excited people — threw a rain of carnations and roses, forming a cloak over him. The program was interrupted for a long time by this emotional tribute.
Álvarez continued their tour to Brazil and also returned to Buenos Aires. They had an exclusive recording contract with Victor and recorded Granada by Agustín Lara and Despedida by María Grever with the RCA Orchestra under the direction of conductor Vieri Fidanzini.

Professor Laurence Fraser Levy (16 November 1921 – 29 May 2007) was a pioneering neurosurgeon based in Harare, Zimbabwe, noted as the first neurosurgeon in Africa. They were Professor of Surgery and Anatomy at the University of Zimbabwe and managed to train about a dozen other neurosurgeons despite the lack of resources. They published more than 90 articles. They were also awarded a gold medal in 2005 by the most popular international group of neurosurgeons.
Born in London on 16 November 1921, Levy was the son of Hyman Levy, professor of mathematics at Imperial College London, and their wife Marion, a schoolmaster's daughter. They were educated at the King's College School in Wimbledon, south London, and Peter Symonds School in Winchester. They studied medicine at University College Hospital in London, qualifying in 1945. After completing a spell of national service as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, stationed at Lübeck on West Germany's north coast, they were a demonstrator of anatomy at the University of Toronto in Canada from 1950, then a resident in neurosurgery at New York University Hospital in 1954 and, a year later, Bellevue Hospital. They returned to the UK in 1956. Neurosurgeons they cited as influences included Canada's Wilder Penfield and Thomas Hoen of New York University.
After failing to find a post in the British National Health Service, they signed on as a ship's surgeon on the way to China, and then in 1956 settled in Salisbury, the capital of Southern Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), where they became consultant neurosurgeon to the city's hospitals. They remained there for the rest of their professional life, and was appointed professor of neurosurgery in 1972. A vocal opponent of apartheid in South Africa, they also opposed Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 and supported the black nationalist movements against Ian Smith's government during the Bush War of the 1970s. In 1966 they married Lorraine, a doctor of medicine with whom they had two sons.
In later life, Levy was concerned by the trend whereby doctors trained in the developing world would move to more advanced countries to work. In a 2003 article published in the BMJ they suggested that it might be beneficial for developing countries to give graduates qualifications that would not be recognised abroad.
By the time of their death in 2007, Levy was a trustee of the Epilepsy Support Foundation, an organisation they helped form in 1990 in Harare (as Salisbury was renamed in 1982). They had a very strong interest in epilepsy, beginning in the 1950s, when they treated Nicholas George as their seventh patient with epilepsy. At the age of 12, George was chased from a government school because of seizures and when they met Levy, they asked about forming an association to support people with epilepsy. The dream was realised year later on 17 April 1990 when the foundation was formed in Harare. George died in 1999, almost eight years before Levy's own death. The pair is highly credited for building it, which now runs the Nicholas George Epilepsy Centre and Professor Levy Epilepsy Clinic in Harare.

Boskydell is an unincorporated community in Makanda Township, Jackson County, Illinois, United States.
The community became known for its high-quality sandstone, mined from two nearby quarries.
History
As early as 1852, surveyors for the Illinois Central Railroad discovered a very good deposit of sandstone at Boskydell.
The sandstone was used to build bridges and abutments when constructing the railroad, and a siding was built to the quarry in Boskydell.
As the settlement along the tracks began to grow, the siding was used as a shipping point for agricultural products and lumber.
The quarry operator, Samuel Cleland, surveyed and laid out town lots in 1876 near the railroad and named the town Boskydell ("brushy valley").
A village grew around the railroad stop, and soon had a blacksmith shop, two general stores, two cream stations and a cooperage.
A post office was established in 1885. A second quarry was opened around this date.
Boskydell sandstone was valued for its warm, reddish-brown color, and was used in the construction of several prominent buildings in Illinois, including: the foundation of the Southern Illinois University in nearby Carbondale; a Methodist church in Murphysboro; the First Presbyterian Church in Carbondale; and the former First Baptist Church of Carbondale. Local gravestones were carved from Boskydell sandstone, as may be seen in Oakland Cemetery and in Woodlawn Cemetery in Carbondale. Most notably, Boskydell sandstone was used in the construction of the great columns on the north, east, and south sides of the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois. The trimmings on the front of the capitol building are also Boskydell sandstone.
In 1883, the Boskydell quarries were purchased by a stone merchant in Chicago, Mr. Rawles, who installed about forty thousand dollars' worth of modern machinery, including hoisting machines, dressing machines, steam drills, saws, and a gravity railroad from the quarries to the Illinois Central Railway.
By 1909, Boskydell had several thriving businesses including a bank, two livery stables, a rifle range, a grain warehouse, a saw mill, four grocery stores and a tonsorial parlor (barber shop). There was also a school.
Today, a scattering of residents live in the quiet community, and the quarries have been closed several years.
The Boskydell Baptist Church continues to be a center of the community, constituted in 1906 as the Boskydell Free Baptist Church with the Rev. A. J. Rendleman as pastor.

Tarpaper Sky is the fourteenth solo studio album by Rodney Crowell. Crowell co-produced the album with long-time collaborator Steuart Smith and Dan Knobler. Tarpaper Sky follows Crowell's Grammy-winning duet album with Emmylou Harris, Old Yellow Moon and is their first release on New West.
Tarpaper Sky is made up of entirely original Crowell compositions. Doug Freeman of the Austin Chronicle credits Crowell for "balancing ballads and barroom stomps ... with their characteristic sense of autobiographical detail and precarious mortality."
The track, "God I'm Missing You," originally appeared on the 2012 Vanguard Records release Kin: Songs by Mary Karr & Rodney Crowell. Lucinda Williams performed the song on that compilation album. The phrase "Tarpaper Sky" appears in a line in that song.
Critical reception
Tarpaper Sky garnered critical acclaim by music critics. At Metacritic, they assign a "weighted average" rating called a Metascore to albums based upon the ratings and reviews by selected independent publications, and the album's score is an 84 out of 100 with nine reviews used, which means the album received "universal acclaim". Thom Jurek of Allmusic rated the album four stars out of five, stating that "This is Crowell at their best: focused, balanced, clever, at times profound" on a release that is "a welcome return to form." At The Independent, Andy Gill rated the album four stars out of five, saying how the release "finds them relaxed and confident in their craft". Steve Johnson of the Chicago Tribune rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of four, writing that "With effortless melodies played with the grace and unforced power from a veteran band, 'Tarpaper Sky' showcases Crowell's still-potent voice, all honey and cedar and sly inflection, and their knack for finding the words to make simple wisdom and an older man's reflections resonate." At USA Today, Steve Jones rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of four, stating that this is a "fine collection of retro-sounding and embraceable tunes." At Country Weekly, Tammy Ragusa graded the album an A−, writing that "His lyrics are overflowing with imagery and meaning [...] both weighty and witty [...] and their voice is laden with texture."
Luke Torn of Uncut rated the album an eight out of a ten, writing how "Crowell's versatile, impassioned voice is in fine fettle, a confident mix of goofiness and longing, anticipation and excitement, sadness and sentimentality, as if he's just now entering a new prime." At American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that " the organic Tarpaper Sky is a welcome reminder that at 63 they remain capable of releasing beautifully crafted music that can stand toe to toe with their best." Stuart Henderson of Exclaim! rated the album a nine out of a ten, stating that "This is just vintage Crowell, which is to say that Tarpaper Sky is an essential record by one of the best." At The Austin Chronicle, Doug Freeman rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, writing how the release "proves that the Houston Kid in their 60s remains as vital as ever, balancing ballads and barroom stomps, both cut with their characteristic sense of autobiographical detail and precarious mortality." Eric R. Danton of Paste rated the album a seven-point-three out of ten, saying that "Though these 11 songs aren't always as sharply drawn as their best material, there's plenty to love here." At Blurt, Lee Zimmerman rated the album four stars out of five, stating that "Tarpaper Sky finds Crowell yet again emphasizing the superior songwriting skills that have been their stock in trade since the very beginning."

Thomas William Worsdell (14 January 1838 – 28 June 1916) was an English locomotive engineer. They were born in Liverpool into a Quaker family.
Family
T. W. Worsdell – normally known as William – was the eldest son of Nathaniel Worsdell (1809–1886), and grandson of the coachbuilder Thomas Clarke Worsdell (1788–1862). Their younger brother, Wilson Worsdell (1850–1920), was also a locomotive engineer. T. C. Worsdell had become a Quaker at some point between 1812 and 1816, and their descendants, including Nathaniel, William and Wilson, were brought up in the Quaker faith.
William was born at their parents' house in Liverpool on 14 January 1838. They began school at the age of two, and in 1847 was sent as a boarder to Ackworth, a Quaker school in Yorkshire, where they remained until 1852.
Career
They worked at the Crewe Works of the LNWR under John Ramsbottom but in 1865 moved to the United States to the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1871 they were invited by Francis William Webb to return to Crewe. In 1881 they were appointed locomotive superintendent of the Great Eastern Railway, but in 1885 moved to the North Eastern Railway, being replaced at the GER by James Holden. They retired from the NER on 1 October 1890 due to ill health and was replaced by their younger brother Wilson Worsdell.
They died in Arnside on 28 June 1916.

England Is Mine is a 2017 British biographical drama film, based on the early years of singer Morrissey, before they formed The Smiths in 1982 with Johnny Marr. Originally titled Steven (Morrissey's first name), the title of the film comes from a lyric in the Smiths' song "Still Ill": "England is mine, and it owes me a living." The film is an unauthorised portrayal of Morrissey's pre-success years. It is Mark Gill's feature-length directorial debut, as well as Jodie Comer's first feature film appearance.
The film stars Jack Lowden as Morrissey, and was directed and co-written by Mark Gill. It co-stars Jessica Brown Findlay as Linder Sterling and Laurie Kynaston as Johnny Marr. It premiered at the closing gala of the Edinburgh Film Festival on 2 July 2017, and was released in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2017, and in the United States on 25 August 2017.
Plot
Young, introverted Steven Patrick Morrissey is a sullen, dissatisfied, and shy teen growing up in Manchester in the 1970s. Withdrawn and a loner, they go out to listen to music at night and then submits letters and reviews to music newspapers. Their father wants them to get a job, their mother wants them to follow their passion for writing, and Steven doesn't quite know what they want to do. Their new friend, artist Linder Sterling, inspires them to continue to write lyrics and urges them to start to perform, but they eventually move to London. Forced to earn a living and fit in with society, Steven's frustrations and setbacks continue to mount. Although they eventually write some songs with guitarist Billy Duffy and they try their hand at singing and enjoys it, eventually Duffy breaks it off, and nothing substantially changes in their life, so Steven seems at the end of their tether. At the end of the film, guitarist Johnny Marr (with whom they would go on to form The Smiths) shows up on their doorstep in 1982.

Production
Jack Lowden, the star of the film, did not know much about Morrissey when they were cast. Director Mark Gill also discouraged Lowden from finding out too much about the singer, and banned them from reading their autobiography or watching old TV appearances, so that the character – a troubled and introverted teen before they started a band or became at all successful – could be played as written.
Reception
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 5.53/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "England Is Mines smartly assembled cast and strong sense of place are often enough to compensate for this unauthorized biopic's distance from its subject." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 45 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars and wrote: "Morrissey gets the cuddly Billy Liar treatment in this weirdly generic movie about their early teen life in Manchester that sometimes seems to be straightforwardly channelling the kitchen-sink spirit of 60s British cinema that Morrissey famously adored – but with much less of the acid irony and alienation that they extracted from it." Owen Gleiberman in Variety stated: "England Is Mine just feels like a stopgap movie made by people who couldn't afford to get the rights to the Smiths' catalogue. The poster calls it a meditation 'on becoming Morrissey,' but it would be more accurate to describe it as a movie about waiting around dejectedly until there's nothing left to do but become Morrissey." Tim Robey in The Telegraph gave England Is Mine two out of four stars and wrote: "The film romanticises the ambitions hatched in male bedrooms and gives the embarrassing impression that's where all sincere art springs from. It's like being crushed in a vice of angst." Jeannette Catsoulis in The New York Times stated: "Skirting sexuality and absent Morrissey's music (the movie ends in 1982 as they and Johnny Marr are on the brink of forming the band), England Is Mine is a soggy schlep. But if you're among those who believe that great art rarely foments in the cheerfully well-adjusted, then this one's for you."
Alan Scherstuhl in the Village Voice praised the film's acting, and wrote: "'Are you going to sulk all day?' our hero gets asked just minutes into Mark Gill's England Is Mine. The remaining eighty-plus minutes of this muted, sometimes arresting drama concern a young man trying to find it in themselves to sulk better." Jamie Neish wrote in CineVue: "Due to rights issues none of Morrissey's music is used. England Is Mine works far better as an evolution of a star pre-fame than anything else. That's not necessarily a bad thing – just different from what audiences may expect." Dave White in The Wrap opined that the film was best seen by true Morrissey fans: "For the millions of true believers out there ... the film provides a blissfully melancholy roll call of pleasures."
England Is Mine was nominated for the "Politiken's Audience Award" at the 2017 CPH:PIX. It was also nominated "Best Film" at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. At the Milan Film Festival, the film was nominated "Best Feature Film" in the "International Competition".

Afghan diaspora refers to the Afghan people that reside and work outside of Afghanistan. They include citizens of Afghanistan who have immigrated to other countries. The majority of the diaspora has been formed by Afghan refugees since the start of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979; the largest numbers temporarily reside in Iran and Pakistan. As stateless refugees or asylum seekers, they are protected by the well-established non-refoulement principle and the U.N. Convention Against Torture. The ones having at least one American parent are further protected by United States laws.
Outside the immediate region of Afghanistan, the largest and oldest communities of Afghans exist in Germany; large communities also exist in the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Turkey, Canada, United Kingdom, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia and Austria. Some are nationals and citizens of the countries in those continents, especially those in the United States, Canada, Germany, Australia and New Zealand.
Traditionally, the borders between Afghanistan and its southern and eastern neighboring countries have been fluid and vague. Like other nations that were created by European empires, the borders of Afghanistan with neighboring countries often do not follow ethnic divisions, and several native ethnic groups are found on both sides of Afghanistan's border. This means that historically there was much movement across present day barriers.
History
After the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Afghan civilians began escaping to neighboring Pakistan and Iran where they were welcomed by the governments of those countries. From there many immigrated to North America, Europe and Oceania. Smaller number went north and began residing in various cities across the then Soviet Union. Some went to India, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere within the Asian continent.
After the withdrawal of Soviet forces in February 1989, large number of Afghans began returning to their homeland, but after the mujahideen took control of the country in 1992 they again began migrated to neighboring countries. From there the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) and many others began helping Afghans to resettle in Europe, North America and Oceania.
Since March 2002, around 4.4 million Afghan refugees have been repatriated to Afghanistan with the assistance of the UNHCR and IOM. Little over 1.4 million still remain in Pakistan and 2.5 million or so in Iran. A number of countries that were part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have granted permanent residency to tens of thousands of eligible Afghans. This creates a legal pathway for those Afghans to become citizens of those countries. Native people of Afghanistan now reside in at least 96 countries around the world. Some of those returning from Pakistan have complained that "they have been beaten and slapped and told nobody in Pakistan wants them anymore." Others have regarded Pakistan as their home because they were born there. Returnees from Iran experience similar or worst punishments. A number of returnees to Afghanistan make new journeys to the European Union (EU) to seek asylum there.
Afghan diaspora around the world
Numerous local places around the world with a high concentration of Afghans have been dubbed "Little Kabul", including Centerville District in Fremont, California, U.S., Steindamm in Hamburg, Germany, Lajpat Nagar in Delhi, India, and Hotel Sevastopol in Moscow, Russia.
Western Asia
Approximately 780,000 registered citizens of Afghanistan are temporarily residing in Iran under the care and protection of the UNHCR. The UNHCR stated in 2020 that little over 2 million undocumented citizens of Afghanistan may be residing in various parts of the country. According to IOM, over 1.1 million of them were repatriated to Afghanistan in 2021.
Significant number of Afghans also reside in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Around 300,000 were reported to be in the UAE where many work in the fields of construction and agriculture, and as business people in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Some of them could be Iranians or Pakistanis using false Afghan passports. Approximately 10,000 Afghans reside in Israel. They are Israelis by nationality. Between 3,500 and 4,000 Afghans reside in Qatar.
South Asia
Little over 1.4 million registered citizens of Afghanistan are temporarily residing in Pakistan. Of these, 58.1% reside and work in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 22.8% in Balochistan, 11.7% in Punjab, 4.6% in Sindh, 2.4% in the capital Islamabad and 0.3% in Azad Kashmir. They are also under the care and protection of the UNHCR. Some claim that there may be little over 1 million citizens of Afghanistan residing and working in Pakistan without any form of legal documents. But they do not explain where or how those undocumented Afghan citizens reside and work in Pakistan without the Interior Minister taking any action against them. The IOM stated that over 1.1 million undocumented Afghans were repatriated to Afghanistan in 2021. Afghans residing in Pakistan must visit Islamabad in order to obtain their visas to other countries around the world.
Around 15,806 similarly reside in India, mostly in the capital Delhi. In addition to that, there may be around 3.2 million ethnic Pashtuns who trace their origins to present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan. Members of this group are mainly in the Rohilkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, and the cities of Mumbai and Kolkata. They are neither citizens of Pakistan nor Afghanistan. Some prominent figures that belong to this Indian group are Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Feroz Khan, Kader Khan, Madhubala, Zakir Husain and Mohammad Yunus.
An unknown number of Afghans also reside in Nepal. Most of these fled Afghanistan as refugees but came to the capital Kathmandu from Delhi in for better aspirations.
Central Asia
In 1999, there were about 10,000 Afghans residing in Uzbekistan. Most returned to Afghanistan or immigrated to other countries. Their total number was 2,500 by 2005. The number of Afghans in Tashkent was about 1,000 in 2017. The number of Afghans in Tajikistan is approximately 6,775 as of 2021. Hundreds are also known to be residing elsewhere. It is believed some 2,500 and probably over 3,000 are in Kazakhstan.
East and Southeast Asia
As of December 2020, there are 7,629 registered Afghan refugees residing in Indonesia under the care and protection of the UNHCR. The government of Japan reported 3,509 natives of Afghanistan residing in its country. Malaysia has approximately 1,100 Afghans. In China, there are "a few thousand" Afghans residing there, including traders based in the international trade city of Yiwu. Small number of natives from Afghanistan also reside and work in Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong, and in the Philippines.
Europe
Native people from Afghanistan can be found all over Europe. Germany has the largest Afghan community in that continent. In the end of 2020, a total of 271,805 persons with Afghan citizenship resided in Germany, including refugees and asylum seekers. They are the third largest foreign group residing and working in the city of Hamburg, after the Poles and the Turks.
There may be as much as 150,000 Afghan refugees in Russia, a third of them reside and work in Moscow.
Elsewhere in Europe various size communities of Afghans exist in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Greece, Italy, Finland, Republic of Ireland, etc. Some have long been citizens of those countries while others are there to seek asylum. The ones that are denied such relief are sent back to Afghanistan. It was reported in 2001 that about 20,000 Afghans were residing in Ukraine. Of these, 15,000 were living in Kyiv and remaining in the Dnieper region.
Between 1992 and 2002, Germany received the highest asylum requests from Afghans in Europe, a total of 57,600. The Netherlands received 36,500 refugees and asylum seekers, the United Kingdom received 29,400, Austria 25,800, Denmark 7,300 and Sweden 3,100. All other countries in the (pre-2004) EU received less than 2,000 asylum requests each from Afghan citizens. Many also arrived during the recent migrant crisis, especially to Germany, Sweden and Austria.
Americas
The United States has one of the largest and oldest Afghan population in the Americas, with about 250,000 residing in that country as of 2022. The early ones had arrived before the 1930s. Many were admitted after 1980 under and became Americans under , and , including under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000. They reside and work in nearly all U.S. states, including in California, New York, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, Michigan, Idaho, Missouri, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland, Connecticut, Colorado, Ohio, Utah, New Mexico, Oregon, and Tennessee. Their total number is expected to increase in the coming years.
Afghan Canadians form the second largest Afghan community in North America after Afghan Americans. Over 83,995 Afghan natives are settled in Canada and are Canadian citizens. The overwhelming majority of them reside in and around the city of Toronto. The remaining can be found in Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary, etc.
Small number of natives from Afghanistan are also reported to be residing and working in Ecuador, Brazil, Cuba, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, Cayman Islands, and Trinidad and Tobago.
Oceania
Afghans have immigrated to Australia since the mid-19th century. The Ghan passenger train that travels between Adelaide in the south and Darwin in the north is named after them. There are over 47,484 Afghan Australians. They reside in a number of cities but mainly in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane. Around 3,414 Afghans reside in New Zealand. They are all citizens of those two countries. Small number of natives from Afghanistan reportedly reside and work in the islands of Papua New Guinea, Nauru, and Fiji.
Africa
Small number of natives from Afghanistan are also reported to be residing and working in Egypt, Kenya, Madagascar, South Africa, Morocco, Algeria, Chad, Ethiopia, and Nigeria.

Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French Impressionist artist Camille Pissarro. It was painted in 1877, and displayed the same year at an exhibition now generally referred to as the third Impressionist exhibition. The picture is large by Pissarro's measure, and they described the effort of painting it as the 'work of a benedictine'. Pissarro was proud of the painting, and it remained in their family's possession until 1913. It presently hangs in the National Gallery, London.
Location
In 1872 Pissarro moved for the second time to the commune of Pontoise some twenty miles north-west of Paris, where they lived with their family until 1884. The rolling hills of the close by neighbourhood of L'Hermitage provided the setting for a large number of Pissarro's paintings during their stays at Pontoise.
The Côte des Bœufs ('cattle ridge') is a steep hill face just north of the River Oise, and just west of the rue de L'Hermitage—the Departmental road passing through the neighbourhood. The name is acquired from a hillside pathway called the sente des Boves ('cattle snicket'—Boves being a Latin word, translating into French as Bœufs). From this location in particular Pissarro painted scenes on five occasions in three different decades.
Composition, colour, and texture
Pissarro's picture of a view up the hillside, their striking ranks of tree trunks and the lines of the buildings, as well as the atypically vertical format of this landscape painting, all create a strongly vertical dynamic. The sloping lines of the undergrowth, rooftops and hilltop contrast with the upward thrust of the work, but this contrast is toned down by the presence of the trees, which veil— almost screening off—the middle-distance, causing the viewer's eye to skid across the surface of the composition. The confident presentment of triangular gables climbing the hill shows some of the influence Paul Cézanne's technique of emphatic spatial compression, though Pissarro applies it without the aggression associated with Cézanne's method. Open sky appears to the top right of the picture, in the direction of which the branches of trees reach, echoing the lines of the gables.
Pissarro's method of implying depth in this taut and confined picture relies in part on the careful control of light, colour and contrast. Throughout the painting, combinations in close proximity of different colours and tones are observed. At the foreground, physically neighbouring colours and tones are at their darkest and most densely compact. This use of immediate—sometimes incongruous—contrasts has an exaggerative effect on the foreground's strong colour saturation; itself a component in the effect of aerial perspective. In addition to this local differentiating of the range and compactness of contrasting pigments, Pissarro also variegated the work in a more general way; the predominant colour at the foreground is green, and as the picture recedes, the use of greens is gradually discounted and hues of red are subtly amplified. Just after the completion of this painting, Pissarro made prints such as their Paysage en long, and Paysage sous bois, à l'Hermitage (both 1879) wherein they experimented with similar methods of deploying degrees of light and contrast to denote depth.
The surface of The Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage is heavily worked. In many parts of the painting, brush-strokes are applied over dried and hardened earlier layers of paint. In some places such as in the tree trunks, these layers appear as having been being applied in long and sometimes thin strokes of parallel—or near parallel—directions. Sometimes the more lightly applied later layers are seen skipping along the peaks and valleys of an earlier layer. Although Pissarro went to these lengths to effect a particular textural plasticity at the painted surface, they did not always extend this in such a way as to fully represent the actual plasticity of the trees—going so far in some areas as to paint them with no clearly defined edges.
In other areas such as that of undergrowth to the fore, shorter strokes have been criss-crossed, creating an effect not unlike that of a woven fabric. In addition to this labour-intensive technique of layer-building, Pissarro used the more traditional method of applying paint with impasto to consolidate the picture's texture. The technique of painting kaleidoscopically criss-crossing areas has the effect of attracting the eye and drawing it into the pattern, but the price of achieving this is the apparent submerging of details—such as those of the two people ambling down the hill—beneath impasto and contending colours. The critic Charles Ephrussi commented in 1880 on the 'doughy, fleecy, tormented surface' of Pissarro's work, and this imprisoning of matter beneath motif displeased Pissarro, who frequently complained that their method was lacking in visual clarity.
Painting materials
Pissarro's handling of colour in this painting is intricate as is described in the above paragraph but their palette is rather limited. The subdued tonal structure was not achieved by the use of dull earth colours but by mixing pure strong pigments such as ultramarine, vermilion, emerald green and chrome yellow. In the last stages Pissarro added strong accents of pure ultramarine and vermilion in small areas of the painting.
History of the painting
Much of Pissarro's work from the 1860s and early 1870s was characteristically light, airy and panoramic, such as their painting of 1864–5, The Banks of the Marne at Chennevières. With the Montfoucault works of the middle 1870s, Pissarro turned to explore a narrower theme of peasant rurality, and with the wooded sous bois ('undergrowth') landscapes of the late 1870s, this quest for intimacy further constricted and darkened. In spite of this aesthetic contraction, some of the sous bois paintings were quite large and The Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage is in fact one of Pissarro's largest paintings. The densely treated surface, the extensive use of tone, the fragmented and overlaying strokes, and the theme of buildings seen through a screen of trees is all characteristic of their work at the end of the 1870s, and the abstractly and closely conceived internal rhythms are very remote from the clear air of the earlier pictures.
In 1877 what is now known as the third Impressionist exhibition (though it was not then so-called) was held in Paris. There exists in the exhibition catalogue a record that a painting by Pissarro entitled Le verger, côte Saint-Denis, à Pontoise was displayed in the third gallery of the exhibition. This painting is almost certainly The Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage. Among those viewing at the exhibition were the Impressionist apologist Georges Rivière, who described it as 'a large landscape by Pissarro', and the critic Amedée Descubes who remarked on the 'attractive painting, a small house hidden away in the forest, which struck us by the firmness and simplicity of its brushwork'.
Pride of place in the third gallery at the exhibition was given to Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Bal du moulin de la Galette, and The Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage was displayed next to it. The rude and wintry hillside features, the anonymous peasant figures, and the worked and reworked surface of the Pissarro landscape are in dramatic contrast with the neighbouring Renoir painting's fleeting display of a summertime dance in Paris. A modern conception of Impressionism frequently puts a premium on the swift or improvised application of paint to the canvas, but this important characteristic is clearly absent in Pissarro's laboriously constructed picture. The close proximity of these two works, painted by two artists then recognised to be at the centre of the movement now called Impressionism, graphically highlighted the artistic tensions native to the Impressionist school.
The same year Pissarro painted The Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage, their friend Paul Cézanne painted their The Orchard, Côte Saint-Denis. The two artists had been friends for many years and had collaborated on a large number of works between 1865 and 1885. This Cézanne painting was also displayed, along with Pissarro's Côte des Bœufs and Renoir's Bal and other paintings, in the third gallery at the exhibition, but it was listed in the catalogue simply as being one of four examples of Cézanne's Paysage; Etude d'après nature. Although the place-names in the latterly adopted titles of both the Cézanne painting and the Pissarro painting refer to the same location, it is not clear that both paintings actually show exactly the same spot. However, a number of very obvious themes such as those of the strongly coloured roof tiles, the precipitously dropping hillside, and of buildings seen through trees, are common to both pictures.
In 1923 when the painting was in the possession of the Knoedler Gallery (London), the artist Walter Sickert wrote, "The large canvas by Pissarro entitled La Côte des Boeufs, with its beautiful and highly complicated intricacies of design, its solidity of architecture, and a certain human warmth and tenderness, is perhaps as important an example of this insufficiently appreciated painter's work as any that exists. A writer is to-day almost afraid to use of a work of art the term "laborious". They would probably be supposed to imply depreciation, or to be indulging in the irony that is almost de rigueur. But the charm of a picture like this lies chiefly in its immense and indefatigable laboriousness, in labour so cunning, so swift and so patient, that the more it is piled up, the greater the clarity and simplicity of the result. "Un travail de Bénédictin," as I have heard themselves call it."
Provenance
The Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage hung in Pissarro's bedroom for many years, and at their one-man show in 1892, they asked an optimistically large figure of 2000 francs for it. In 1913, the artist's wife, Julie Pissarro, sold the painting to the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, who in turn sold to it to Knoedler (of Old Bond Street, London) in 1920. The work was presented to the Tate Gallery in 1926—funded by a bequest from the National Art Collections Fund—and was transferred to the National Gallery, London in 1950.

Shamrock Bowl I was the first championship game played between two Irish American Football teams in the IAFL, the game was played in St Marys RFC Templeville road in Dublins southside. The Dublin Celts and Craigavon Cowboys met in a very rough and difficult contest for both teams, exacerbated by a high level of penalty flags thrown in the game, causing frustration to both sides. The Celts ran a mixture of the wishbone formation, and the pro set during the game but the Cowboys defence managed to prevent the Celts scoring a touchdown. The Celts were ahead for most of the game when they scored a safety by Carlos De la Garza early in the game. However, in the final quarter of the game Cowboys quarterback Geoff Donaghy passed to wide receiver John Mulally to score the only touchdown of the game. The Cowboys won 6-2, the lowest scoring Shamrock Bowl in the history of the league.
It was the same two teams who were to meet in Shamrock bowl 11, in North RFC in Belfast, this time the Dublin Celts emerged victorious in a tough hard hitting game, 25 to 15. at the end of the game both teams went back to the Cowboys clubhouse for a post-game celebration, such was the sportsmanship displayed by both teams, even after a tough grueling game.

Kiyevskaya (), named for the nearby Kiyevsky railway station, is a station on the Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya line of the Moscow Metro. Opened in 1953, it is lavishly decorated in the quasi-baroque style that predominated in the early 1950s. The square pylons are faced with white Ural marble and elaborately patterned ceramic tile and the plastered ceiling is decorated with a series of frescoes by various artists depicting life in Ukraine. A large mosaic at the end of the platform commemorates the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Russia and Ukraine. Light comes from a row of hexagonal chandeliers. The architects were L. V. Lile, V. A. Litvinov, M. F. Markovsky, and V. M. Dobrokovsky.
Kiyevskaya has no vestibule of its own. Instead, escalators at the end of the hall lead to Kiyevskaya and thence to that station's entrance, which is built into the Kiyevsky railway station.
For half a century Kiyevskaya was the terminus of the Arbatsko–Pokrovskaya line; the 2003 extension to Park Pobedy ended that situation.
Transfers
From this station it is possible to transfer to Kiyevskaya on the Filyovskaya line and the Kiyevskaya on the Ring.

Rafael Fernando Squirru (March 23, 1925 – March 5, 2016) was an Argentine poet, lecturer, art critic and essayist.
Biographical notes
Born and raised in Buenos Aires, Squirru was educated at Saint Andrew's Scot School and at the Jesuit El Salvador Secondary School. They graduated with a Law Degree at the University of Edinburgh in 1948.
After founding the Buenos Aires Museum of Modern Art in 1956, they went on to champion the cause of Argentine and Latin American art as Director of Cultural Affairs (1960) in the government of Arturo Frondizi. Among their many initiatives of that period, Alicia Penalba's sculptures and Antonio Berni's etchings were sent to the São Paulo and Venice Biennales respectively, both artists obtaining First Prize.
Named Cultural Director of the Organization of American States (OAS) in 1963 with headquarters in Washington, D.C., they continued their task of promotion of North and Latin American culture until their resignation in 1970. It was at this time that they supported the construction of the impressive memorial monument to U.S. President John F. Kennedy by Uruguayan artist Lincoln Presno in Quemú Quemú, a vast deserted plain in the Argentine province of La Pampa; their outspoken inauguration speech as official representative of the OAS, pronounced during the military government of General Juan Carlos Onganía, won public acclaim while provoking angry reactions on the part of the authorities present, earning them the local government's condemnation as persona non grata, revoked a few years later.
Back in Buenos Aires they have supported culture in all its forms through an incessant activity of lectures in their own country and abroad, prologues for artists' exhibitions and a constant output of articles on Argentine daily La Nación, with which they collaborated for over twenty years, often sharing the Culture page with Jorge Luis Borges during the Eighties.
Several volumes of Squirru's poetry and prose writings have been published over the years, most of which are today out of print and considerably difficult to find.
Their friends, correspondents and acquaintances included such personalities as Henry Miller, Frank Wright(disambiguation), Fernando Demaría, Thomas Merton, Edward Hopper, Ned O'Gorman, Huntington Hartford, Sir Herbert Read, Edward Albee, Oswaldo Vigas, Julio Cortázar, Olga Blinder, Alejandra Pizarnik, Barnaby Conrad, Paul Blackburn, Amancio Williams, Jackie Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, Batuz, Renata Adler, J. Carter Brown, Benjamin Bradlee, Nina Auchincloss Straight, Kay Halle, Alberto Ginastera, Elsa Wiezell, Hiram D. Williams, Leopoldo Marechal, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Stefan Baciu, Emilio Pettoruti, Antonio Berni, Eduardo Mac Entyre, Pérez Celis, Leopoldo Presas, Leonardo Castellani and Marco Denevi.

Quotes
Prose
On the importance of culture
The time has come when it must be acknowledged that art and thought are more than just a luxury: they are the abstract symbol of a community's deepest longings.
We should be careful not to raise economic and social issues above the level where they naturally belong for when that happens, we shall have succumbed to the pathetic idolatry of the golden calf.
We are pained not so much by the ignorance of those who cannot read, as by the ignorance of those who cannot see.
Our enemy is not man but stupidity.
I can see no higher privilege for a society than that of having the intellectual and the poet in its midst.
Societies will not tolerate a state of spiritual vacuum.
On the cultural identity and importance of Latin America
The great nations of Spain and Portugal, England and Scotland, Ireland and other European countries have given being to our communities and, happily for Latin America, in combination with the blood of the native Indian peoples which runs through our veins, sustaining and nourishing us.
Latin America is underdeveloped economically. Latin America is not underdeveloped culturally.
In the realm of creative achievement, many among the best artists, composers, writers and intellectuals of today are to be found in Latin America.
On the functions of art
The purpose of art and thought is to reveal to man their true essence putting them face to face with their deeper self.
Art is like a mirror and every man reacts to a work of art according to what they themselves is.
Very often what art reveals to man is something they would prefer not to see; that explains why art has so many detractors.
On the responsibilities of artists and intellectuals
The poet must be a part of the world but they cannot be its creature.
I cannot agree to reduce or limit the creative act to the needs and levels of sociological considerations.
A poet is neither a politician nor an economist nor a sociologist. The intellectual, the artist and the creative mind does not adhere to this or that partial aspect of man but to man himself.
The great legacies of any culture - whether their creators be called Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Cervantes, Kafka or Picasso - move us today because they present man with their problems, their pains and their joys, which are far more lasting than their social, political or economic condition.
Those who have pledged themselves to the major revolution of the spirit must firmly refuse the compromise of minor revolutions and the distraction of partial goals.
On Communism in Latin America
The Marxist alternative might well carry out a revolution, as in Cuba, but it would never be our own and would thus bring all the frustration that incompatibility implies.
Take away the images of the Saints and you will get the image of Lenin in no time.
Communism overruns any country which does not possess its own mystique.
(The above quotes are all excerpts from Squirru's addresses delivered at the Panamerican Union in Washington D.C. between 1963 and 1964, which can be found in their entirety in The Challenge of the New Man. A cultural approach to the Latin American scene, Washington D.C., Pan American Union, 1964.)

The 2003 Mario Andretti Grand Prix at Road America was the twelfth round of the 2003 CART World Series season, held on August 3, 2003 at the Road America circuit in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin.
The race was shortened to 34 laps from the scheduled 60 after the race was red-flagged twice because of rain. The first stoppage lasted 20 minutes after only 1 lap and the second lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes after lap 7. With darkness impending at the restart after the second red flag period, the race had to be shortened from its original length.
Race cancellation and rescheduling
This race was canceled in March 2003 (along with the planned race for 2004) after a legal dispute developed between the Road America's owner George Bruggenthies and CART. However, Mario Andretti was able to negotiate an agreement between the parties and the race was restored to CART's schedule in April. The race was then named in Andretti's honor.

In August 2005 Shelton was due to move to Football League Championship club Burnley after a successful pre-season trial. They attempted to sign Shelton, but a work permit was rejected, and in August 2006 they joined Helsingborg for about £100,000. During the 2006 season, they scored nine goals in 19 games in the Swedish Allsvenskan, despite playing only irregularly due to repeated injuries. They scored a total of 17 goals in 28 competitive matches, including five goals in four Swedish Cup matches on the way to Helsingborg's victory in the competition. Their 120th-minute equaliser against to-be league champions Elfsborg in the quarter-final, which Helsingborg won 5–3 after a penalty shootout (4–4 after extra time), and the 1–0 goal in the final against Gefle, were two of their highlights at the club.
Sheffield United
Despite being signed amidst much fanfare, Shelton did not make their full début until April 2007 in a 2–0 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. They made only three more appearances for the Blades in the Premiership that season as they unsuccessfully battled to avoid relegation.
With the arrival of James Beattie and Billy Sharp at Bramall Lane during the close season they found games no more easy to come by under new manager Bryan Robson. Initially limited to cup appearances, they scored their first competitive goals for the club, netting twice in a 5–0 League Cup win over Morecambe in September 2007.
As the team struggled they began to see more first team action, but was unable to turn appearances into goals, scoring only twice more that season, against Manchester City in the FA Cup and Colchester in the league. With the arrival of new manager Kevin Blackwell Shelton was sidelined once more.
Vålerenga
On 24 July 2008, it was announced that Shelton had been sold to Norwegian side Vålerenga, playing in the Tippeligaen, for around £1m (10m kr). Their contract was to last to the end of the 2011 season. Shelton made their debut on 2 August, scoring their side's lone goal in a 1–1 game at home against Fredrikstad FK. They were considered an attacking player with a speed advantage: they were the fastest player to run a 40m sprint in the Tippeligaen. They played in the 2008 Norwegian Cup, and was one of their top scorers in the 2010 Tippeligaen season with 12 goals.
Shelton spent the 2009-2010 season on loan to the Danish side Aalborg BK, playing 11 games. They were part of their squad for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup.
Karabükspor and Volga Nizhny Novgorod
On 4 August 2011, Shelton was transferred to Karabükspor. They played for two years, and chose to retain their jersey number 78 when they moved.
In 2013, Shelton moved to FC Volga Nizhny Novgorod in Russia. The club suffered from financial issues during this period, and frequently missed payments to the players.
Harbour View return
In April 2015, Shelton went on trial with MLS side Colorado Rapids. Shelton returned to Harbour View at the beginning of 2017, after being out of the game for two years with injury, scoring in their first match on their return. This match was their last before retirement.
International career
Shelton was capped at the U-17, U-20, U-23 and national levels for Jamaica. They scored their 25th goal for Jamaica vs Guadeloupe.  They are the only man to score four goals on their international début. In June 2008 they scored five goals in two 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying games for Jamaica against the Bahamas. Later the same month, they scored two goals as Jamaica won 7–0 and scored a hat-trick as Jamaica won 6–0. Shelton was also the top goal scorer in 2010 CONCACAF World Cup qualification matches with seven goals. On 31 January 2010, Shelton scored in a friendly match against Canada to equal Paul Young as Jamaica's all-time leading goalscorer with 28 goals. On 27 November 2010, Shelton became Jamaica's all-time leader scorer with 30 goals after scoring two goals versus Antigua. Jamaica shocked United States 2–1 on to seize the lead in their group in the semi-final round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying in the CONCACAF Zone. Goals from Rodolph Austin and Luton Shelton overcame Clint Dempsey's first-minute strike for the Americans as Jamaica posted their first victory over the US in 19 matches.
Personal life
Shelton had three children with their wife Bobbette.
In 2018, it was announced that Shelton had ALS. They died from complications of the disease on 22 January 2021, aged 35.

Philip John Stephen Dadd (1880 – 2 August 1916) was a British illustrator.
Dadd was born in Poplar. They were born into an artistic family: on their father's side, their uncle was the artist Richard Dadd; on their mother's side, their maternal grandfather was the engraver John Greenaway, and their aunt was the illustrator Kate Greenaway.
Dadd studied at the Slade School of Fine Art from 1900 to 1903, and they became a staff artist at The Sphere magazine. They illustrated the 1904 book William Tell Told Again by P. G. Wodehouse, accompanied by verses written by John W. Houghton.
Their work was included in several public exhibitions before 1914, at the Royal Academy, Brook Street Art Gallery, the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, and the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.
After the outbreak of the First World War, they enlisted in December 1915 as a private in the 16th (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment. They served on the Western Front in France. On 12 August 1916, Dadd's illustration of a British gas sentry ringing a medieval church bell to alert troops of a German gas attack appeared on the cover of The Sphere.
The illustration had been published posthumously: Dadd was killed in France on 2 August 1916.  They are buried in the Maroeuil British Cemetery near Arras.

The 1910 Copa del Rey Final (FEF) was the 9th final of the Spanish cup competition, the Copa del Rey (although technically there was no final, with the tournament being played as a mini-group of three teams). It was one of two rival Cup competitions played in that year due to disagreements between the reigning champion of the tournament, Club Ciclista de San Sebastián, and some of the clubs invited.
The final was played at Tiro del Pichón in Madrid on 26 May 1910. The match was contested by FC Barcelona and Español de Madrid. The latter netted twice in the opening 15 minutes thanks to a brace from Vicente Buylla, thus leading the match 0–2 down at the break, but Barça fought back and scored three goals in the second half to complete a great emotional comeback, thus lifting the trophy for the first time with a 3–2 victory. The Barça goals were scored by Charles Wallace, Carles Comamala and Pepe Rodríguez, who netted the winner in the last-minute.
This was the "official" competition, organised by the newly-created FEF (Federación Española de Fútbol), later Royal Spanish Football Federation (), in Madrid. Both its winner, and that of the rival UECF (Unión Española de Clubes de Fútbol) in San Sebastián played two months earlier, are currently recognised as official by the RFEF.

The Republika Srpska football team () is the official team of Republika Srpska, an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is not affiliated with FIFA or UEFA.
The football team was formed in 1992, following the creation of Republka Srpska as a political entity. The Football Association of Republika Srpska (FSRS) was established on 5 September 1992 in spite of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina which had escalated earlier that year. The main task of FSRS in that period was to organize and manage competitions in the territory of Republika Srpska. The competitions were played in different league formats throughout wartime.
History
During the last years before the break-up of Yugoslavia, football was experiencing much popularity throughout the country, specially because of the series of successes. Such were Yugoslavia winning the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship, being runners-up at the 1990 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, an emotional campaign by the senior team in the 1990 FIFA World Cup in which Yugoslavia officially finished 5th after eliminating Spain in 1/8 finals, but losing dramatically in quarters against Argentina on penalties, a Red Star Belgrade winning of the 1990–91 European Cup and the 1991 Intercontinental Cup, and even the local Republika Srpska major club, FK Borac Banja Luka, won the 1992 Mitropa Cup. Football was always the most popular sport in all of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and those results had especially warm reception among Serbs in Bosnia because Yugoslav national team was known for having in Bosnia its strongest percentages of supporters, Red Star Belgrade was highly popular among Bosnian Serbs, and the conquest of Mitropa Cup in 1992 by Borac was the first ever international trophy won by a Bosnian team.
However, by the time Borac won the Mitropa title, its echo hardly was heard outside Serbian-inhabited parts of Bosnia. The war had started and Yugoslavia was disintegrating. Like the country itself, so the Yugoslav First League fell apart in stages. In summer 1991 clubs from Slovenia and Croatia left and formed their own leagues, and during the 1991–92 season, so did Macedonian and Bosnian clubs as well. Only Borac Banja Luka refused to leave the league and stayed competing in Yugoslav league system long after Bosnia declared independence, supposedly serving as a symbolic proof that Bosnian Serbs continued to belong to Yugoslavia, now formed by Serbia and Montenegro.
When war started, football was used as an important morale-boosting activity, providing soldiers with distraction from the front, and encouraging interaction with peacekeepers. When Bosnia and Herzegovina became internationally recognised, Bosnian Serbs declared their own state demanding independence from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska. Football soon followed this decision, and the Football Association of Republika Srpska was formed along a senior national team. They played its first match at the Banja Luka City Stadium on 20 December 1992, when the rival to the Srpska team was a team representing the Republic of Serbian Krajina. This match ended 1–1. Srpska scored the first goal in the 16th minute thanks to Zoran Nešković and the equaliser was scored in the 45th minute by Tihomir Žorić. Žorić, then playing for Dinara from Knin, was chosen the best player of that friendly match. There were about 2,000 spectators at the FK Borac stadium. Republika Srpska was coached in that match by Miloš Đurković, assistant coach was Mladen Katić, and the selected players were Nikola Čobanović, Dragan Marković, Neđo Zdjelar, Sretko Vojkić, Zoran Vranješ, Stojan Janjetović, Veljko Salamić, Vlado Jagodić, Borče Sredojević, Ljubiša Kukavica, Borislav Tonković, Danijel Pajić, Jovica Lukić, Milan Miladinović, Stojan Malbašić, Enver Ališić, Mićo Gračanin, Zoran Nešković, Aleksa Marić, Predrag Šobot, Boris Gluhović, Filip Trivan, Drago Lukić and Miro Šarac.
The game had a much greater political meaning than a football one. Afterwards, war intensified, and no more national team matches for Republika Srpska were played, the FSRS was more focused in organising a proper club championship and cup competitions. The first to be formed was the Republika Srpska Cup in 1993, while, despite all efforts, a united First League of the Republika Srpska only got formed in 1995.
Although the Dayton Agreement (which ended war conflict in the country) allowed the general forming of independent sport organizations in Republika Srpska which would be recognized internationally, FIFA and UEFA allowed FSRS to participate in the international scene only as part of FSBiH. However, a possibility for international friendly matches for national teams of Republika Srpska was left open, but with explicit permission of FIFA. The national team of Republika Srpska had its "international debut" in 2000 against the Greek club Kavala FC which won 6–0. After that, two other "international matches" were played. In 2001, in Germany, there were two matches against Bayern II (lost by 0–1) and Schweinfurt 05 (won by 4–2). On the other hand, the U21 squad of Republika Srpska takes part in "international" friendly tournaments every year.
In 1995, the First League of Republika Srpska was established as a top division for clubs competition. Also a cup tournament was created, the Republika Srpska Cup. Meanwhile, separate leagues were formed in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina which gathered multinational, as well as ethnic Croat clubs in the country. The Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina, FSBiH, was created in 1992 and was recognised by FIFA in 1996 and UEFA in 1998. As the FSBiH was the only football federation in Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized by FIFA its clubs alone were allowed to compete internationally and contest the newly formed Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Faced with the fact that clubs from Republika Srpska hadn't been allowed to take part in international competitions, FSRS decided to join FSBiH, on 23 May 2002. After that, the First League of Republika Srpska became one of the two second leagues of the country, with the other, First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina joining clubs from the rest of the country, was the other one. Top ranked clubs from the RS First League were promoted to the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which started on 4 August the same year, and has been as such ever since.
The Republika Srpska official football team saw in July 2013 a disputed run over the election of the main coach between 3 candidates; Ilija Petković, Nebojša Gudelj and Željko Buvač. The elected was Buvač who has been keeping the post still by mid-2019. They succeeded Borče Sredojević who ended not leading any game. The first coach was Miloš Đurković, who's assistant was Mladen Katić, and next it was Velimir Sombolac, with Velimir Stojnić as their assistant.
Current status
With similar disputed regions having been granted opportunities to have international matches the FSRS began to receive pressure from the citizens of Republika Srpska to push for more matches for their national team.
Following FIFA's decision on 22 May 2012 to approve the Football Federation of Kosovo to play friendly matches, the FSRS President Mile Kovačević announced the next day that the Association would ask FIFA for the same.

Recent results and forthcoming fixtures
Results in the past
Republika Srpska played its first senior game in 1992 as the national team of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska. It was the only game the team played under such circumstances. Its next game was in 1998, 3 years after the signing of the Dayton agreement, and by then the FA of Republika Srpska had already become part of the structure of the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ever since, it has played unofficial matches against local and foreign clubs. Until 2019 the team has played a total of 15 games.
In recent years, Republika Srpska has planned to play a friendly match against Serbia. Although the Srpska team received the approval of the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina, this match has not been played yet.
Youth competitions
Since 2000, the U19 team regularly takes part in the international Stevan Nešticki Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia. Republika Srpska won the tournament on two occasions (in 2004 and 2012).

Neukrotimyy (, "Inquisitive") was a Project 1135M Burevestnik-class (, "Petrel") Guard Ship (, SKR) or 'Krivak II'-class frigate that served with the Soviet and Russian Navies. The vessel was known as Komsomolets Litvyy () between 1987 and 1990. Launched on 17 September 1977, Neukrotimyy was designed to operate as an anti-submarine vessel with the Baltic Fleet, using an armament built around the Metel Anti-Ship Complex. The vessel undertook many visits to other countries outside the Soviet Unions, including Angola, East Germany, Nigeria and Poland. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1991, the ship was transferred to the Russian Navy and continued to travel to countries like the Netherlands. Despite being accidentally holed in 2005 and being badly burnt in a fire in 2008, Neukrotimyy remained the penultimate of the class to remain in service, finally being decommissioned on 29 June 2009.
Design and development
Neukrotimyy was one of eleven Project 1135M ships launched between 1975 and 1981. Project 1135, the Burevestnik (, "Petrel") class, was envisaged by the Soviet Navy as a less expensive complement to the Project 1134A Berkut A (NATO reporting name 'Kresta II') and Project 1134B Berkut B (NATO reporting name 'Kara') classes of anti-submarine ships. Project 1135M was an improvement developed in 1972 with slightly increased displacement and heavier guns compared with the basic 1135. The design, by N. P. Sobolov, combined a powerful missile armament with good seakeeping for a blue water role. The ships were designated Guard Ship (, SKR) to reflect their substantial greater anti-ship capability than the earlier members of the class and the Soviet strategy of creating protected areas for friendly submarines close to the coast. NATO forces called the vessels 'Krivak II'-class frigates.
Displacing standard and full load, Neukrotimyy was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Power was provided by two M7K power sets, each consisting of a combination of a DK59 and a M62 gas turbine arranged in a COGAG installation and driving one fixed-pitch propeller. Design speed was and range at . The ship's complement was 194, including 23 officers.
Armament and sensors
Neukrotimyy was designed for anti-submarine warfare around four URPK-5 Rastrub missiles (NATO reporting name SS-N-14 'Silex'), backed up by a pair of quadruple launchers for torpedoes and a pair of RBU-6000 Smerch-2 anti-submarine rocket launchers. Both the URPK-5 and the torpedoes also had anti-ship capabilities. Defence against aircraft was provided by forty 4K33 OSA-M (SA-N-4 'Gecko') surface to air missiles which were launched from two twin-arm ZIF-122 launchers. Two AK-100 guns were mounted aft in a superfiring arrangement.
The ship had a well-equipped sensor suite, including a single MR-310A Angara-A air/surface search radar, Don navigation radar, the MP-401S Start-S ESM radar system and the Spectrum-F laser warning system. Fire control for the guns was provided by a MR-143 Lev-214 radar. An extensive sonar complex was fitted, including the bow-mounted MG-332T Titan-2T and the towed-array MG-325 Vega that had a range of up to . The vessel was also equipped with the PK-16 decoy-dispenser system which used chaff as a form of missile defense.
Construction and career
Laid down by on 22 January 1976 with the yard number 163 at the Yantar Shipyard in Kaliningrad, Neukrotimyy was launched on 7 September 1977. The ship was the fifth of the class built at the yard. The vessel, named for a Russian word that can be translated as Indomitable, was commissioned on 30 December and joined the Baltic Fleet.
Soon after entering service, Neukrotimyy was sent on missions to foreign missions to promote friendly relationships between the Soviet Union and other nations. Between 5 and 10 June 1978, the vessel visited Rostock in East Germany. In 1982, the vessel travelled to Africa, spending time in Luanda, Angola, between 12 and 18 June and in Lagos, Nigeria, between 25 June and 2 July. In 1985, the ship travelled to Gdynia in Poland with the Project 58 (NATO reporting name Kynda class) cruiser to commemorate the end of the Second World War, staying for three days from 5 June before returning to Rostock for four days from 7 October.
In honour of the members of the Young Communist League, or Komsomol, of Lithuania, the ship was renamed Komsomolets Litvyy on 2 November 1987. However, the new name did not last long, reverting back on 27 March 1990. Lithuania had declared independence from the Soviet Union 16 days beforehand. June that year saw Neukrotimyy take another tour of the Baltic Sea, taking in Kiel for three days from 5 June, and Szczecin, Poland, for three days from 21 June. The following year saw the ship travel to the Netherlands, a NATO member, visiting Amsterdam between 2 and 6 September. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Neukrotimyy was transferred to the Russian Navy. Travels outside the Baltic continued. For example, between 23 and 24 April 1997, the ship could be found at the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands.
Neukrotimyy continued to serve into the next decade. However, the new century brought a succession of mishaps. 30 July 2005 saw a celebration of the might of the Russian Navy take place in front of the Winter Palace in St Petersburg. Unfortunately, a dummy mine that was to be detonated as part of the spectacle drifted and struck the side of the hull, filling the engine room with water. The swift intervention of the crew saved the ship. Three years later, on 8 December 2008, a fire broke out in the same engine room. Although extinguished, it proved the end for the ship. Neukrotimyy was decommissioned on 29 June 2009. An attempt was made to turn the vessel, the penultimate of the class to be taken out of service, over to a museum, but this failed. Instead the vessel was stored at Baltiysk ready to be broken up but sank in situ on 3 October 2012.

The Athenian Revolution (508–507 BCE) was a revolt by the people of Athens that overthrew the ruling aristocratic oligarchy, establishing the almost century-long self-governance of Athens in the form of a participatory democracy – open to all free male citizens. It was a reaction to a broader trend of tyranny that had swept through Athens and the rest of Greece.
Background
According to legend, Athens was formerly ruled by kings, a situation which may have continued up until the 9th century BCE. During this period, Athens succeeded in bringing the other towns of Attica under its rule. This process of synoikismos – the bringing together into one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility.
From later accounts, it is believed that these kings stood at the head of a land-owning aristocracy known as the Eupatridae (the 'well-born'), whose instrument of government was a Council which met on the hill of Areopagus and appointed the chief city officials known as archons. The archon was the chief magistrate in many Greek cities, but in Athens there was a council of archons which exerted a form of executive government. From the late 8th century BCE there were three archons: the archon eponymos (chief magistrate), the polemarchos (commander-in-chief), and the archon basileus (the ceremonial vestige of the Athenian monarchy). The archon eponymous was the chief archon, and presided over meetings of the Boule and Ecclesia, the ancient Athenian assemblies. The archon eponymous remained the titular head of state even under the democracy, though with much reduced political importance. In 753 BCE the perpetual archonship by the Eupatridae were limited to 10 year terms (the "decennial archons"). After 683 BCE the offices were held for only a single year.
By the 7th century BCE, social unrest had become widespread, as Athens suffered a land and agrarian crisis. Many Greek city-states had seen the emergence of tyrants, opportunistic noblemen who had taken power on behalf of sectional interests. In Megara, Theagenes had come to power as an enemy of the local oligarchs. Their son-in-law, an Athenian nobleman named Cylon, themselves made an unsuccessful attempt to seize power in Athens in 632 BCE. However, the coup was opposed by the people of Athens, who forced Cylon and their supporters to take refuge in Athena's temple on the Acropolis. Cylon and their brother escaped, but their followers were cornered by Athens' nine archons. They were persuaded by the archons to leave the temple and stand trial after being assured that their lives would be spared. In an effort to ensure their safety, the accused tied a rope to the temple's statue and went to the trial. On the way, the rope broke of its own accord. The Athenian archons, led by Megacles, took this as the goddess's repudiation of their suppliants and proceeded to stone them to death. Megacles and their genos, the Alcmaeonidae, were exiled from the city for violating the laws against killing suppliants. In order to restore order, the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft strict new laws, replacing the system of oral law with a written legal code enforced by a court of law. However, these "Draconian" reforms ultimately failed to quell the conflict.
Reform and revolution
Reform
In 594 BCE, Solon, premier archon at the time, issued reforms that defined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens who owned property, Solon reshaped the social framework of the city-state. Under these reforms, a council of 400 members (with 100 citizens from each of Athens's four tribes) called the boule ran daily affairs and set the political agenda. The Areopagus, which formerly took on this role, remained but subsequently carried on the role of "guardianship of the laws". Another major contribution to democracy was Solon's setting up of an ecclesia or Assembly, which was open to all male citizens, regardless of social class. The Alcmaeonids were also allowed back into the city, during the archonship of Solon. Eventually the moderate reforms of Solon, improving the lot of the poor but firmly entrenching the aristocracy in power, gave Athens some stability. For many of the years to come, the nascent democracy even managed to govern itself without an archon.
Democracy however was threatened by tyranny, as several political factions began to vie for control of the Athenian polis. Peisistratos launched a populist coup and seized the reigns of government in Athens, declaring themselves Tyrant. Upon their death, Peisistratos was succeeded to the tyranny by their sons Hippias and Hipparchus, the latter of which was murdered by the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton. Hippias executed the tyrannicides and it was said that they became a bitter and cruel ruler, executing a large number of citizens and imposing harsh taxes on the Athenian populace. Hippias's cruelty soon created unrest among their subjects. As they began losing control, they sought military support from the Persians and formed alliances with other Greek tyrannies. The Alcmaeonidae family of Athens, which Peisistratus had exiled in 546 BCE, was concerned about Hippias forming alliances with the Persian ruling class, and began planning an invasion to depose him.
In 510 BCE Cleomenes I of Sparta successfully invaded Athens and trapped Hippias on the Acropolis. They also took the Pisistratidae children hostage forcing Hippias to leave Athens in order to have them returned safely. Hippias was one of several Greek aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Themistocles, Demaratos, Gongylos or Alcibiades.
Revolution
With the tyrant ousted, the Spartan king installed Isagoras at the head of an oligarchy, made up of Athenian aristocrats that were loyal or sympathetic to Sparta. They found themselves opposed by the majority of Athens, particularly the middle and lower classes, who desired a return to democracy. Cleisthenes, of the pro-democracy Alcmaeonidae clan, was expelled from Athens by the Spartan-backed oligarchs, leaving Isagoras unrivalled in power within the city. Isagoras set about dispossessing hundreds of Athenians of their homes and exiling them on the pretext that they too were cursed by the Alcmaeonidae miasma. They also attempted to dissolve the Boule. However, the council resisted, and the Athenian people declared their support for the council and revolted against the oligarchy. Cleomenes, Isagoras and their supporters were forced by regular citizens to flee to the Acropolis, where they were besieged by Athens' populace for two days. On the third day the Athenians made a truce, allowed Cleomenes and Isagoras to escape, and executed 300 of Isagoras' supporters. Cleisthenes was subsequently recalled, along with hundreds of exiles, and they were elected the first archon of a democratic Athens.
Cleisthenes began to institutionalize the democratic revolution. They commissioned a bronze memorial from the sculptor Antenor in honor of the lovers and tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton, whom Hippias had executed. In order to forestall strife between the traditional clans, which had led to the tyranny in the first place, they changed the political organization from the four traditional tribes, which were based on family relations and which formed the basis of the upper class Athenian political power network, into ten tribes according to their area of residence (their deme,) which would form the basis of a new democratic power structure. Cleisthenes also abolished patronymics in favour of demonymics (a name given according to the deme to which one belongs), thus increasing Athenians' sense of belonging to their local community, thus completely undermining the rule of aristocratic families. They also established sortition – the random selection of citizens to fill government positions rather than kinship or heredity. They also introduced the bouletic oath, "To advise according to the laws what was best for the people". The court system and the Boule were also reorganized and expanded. It was now the role of the Boule to propose laws to the assembly of voters, who convened in Athens around forty times a year for this purpose. The bills proposed could be rejected, passed or returned for amendments by the assembly. Cleisthenes also may have introduced ostracism (first used in 487 BCE), whereby a vote by a plurality of citizens would exile a citizen for 10 years. The initial trend was to vote for a citizen deemed a threat to the democracy (e.g., by having ambitions to set themselves up as tyrant). However, soon after, any citizen judged to have too much power in the city tended to be targeted for exile (e.g., Xanthippus in 485/84 BCE). Under this system, the exiled man's property was maintained, but they were not physically in the city where they could possibly create a new tyranny. One later ancient author records that Cleisthenes themselves was the first person to be ostracized.
The Spartans thought that a free and democratic Athens would be dangerous to Spartan power, and attempted to recall Hippias from Persia and re-establish the tyranny. Democratic Athens sent an embassy to Artaphernes, brother of Darius I, looking for Persian assistance in order to resist the threats from Sparta. Artaphernes asked the Athenians for "Water and Earth", a symbol of submission, if they wanted help from the Achaemenid king. The Athenians ambassadors apparently complied with this request, but then Artaphernes advised the Athenians that they should receive back Hippias, threatening to attack Athens if they did not accept them as their tyrant once more. Nevertheless, the Athenians preferred to remain democratic despite the danger from the Achaemenid Empire, and the ambassadors were disavowed and censured upon their return to Athens. Soon after this, the Ionian Revolt began. It was put down in 494 BCE, but Darius I was intent on punishing Athens for its role in the revolt. In 490 Hippias, still in the service of the Persians, encouraged Darius to invade Greece and attack Athens; when Darius initiated the campaign, Hippias themselves accompanied the Persian fleet and suggested Marathon as the place where the Persian invasion of Attica should begin. But never again would the Peisistratids have influence in Athens.
Democracy and counter-revolution
In 462 BCE, the pro-democracy Ephialtes and their political allies began attacking the Areopagus, a council composed of former archons which was a traditionally conservative force. According to Aristotle and some modern historians, Athens had, since about 470 BCE, been governed under an informal "Areopagite constitution", under the leadership of the aristocrat Cimon. The Areopagus had already been losing prestige ever since 486 BCE, when archons were selected by lot. Ephialtes accelerated this process by prosecuting certain members for maladministration. Having thus weakened the prestige of the council, Ephialtes proposed and had passed in the popular assembly a sweeping series of reforms which divided up the powers traditionally wielded by the Areopagus among the democratic council of the Boule, the Ecclesia itself, and the popular courts. Ephialtes took away from the Areopagus their "additional powers, through which it had guardianship of the constitution." The Areopagus merely remained a high court, in control of judging charges of murder and some religious matters. At the same time or soon afterwards, the membership of the Areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied citizenship. The success of Ephialtes' reforms was rapidly followed by the ostracism of Cimon, which left Ephialtes and their faction firmly in control of the state, although the fully fledged Athenian democracy of later years was not yet fully established; Ephialtes' reforms appear to have been only the first step in the democratic party's programme. Ephialtes, however, would not live to see the further development of this new form of government; In 461 BCE, they were assassinated, succeeded to the democratic leadership by Pericles.
In the wake of Athens' disastrous defeat in the Sicilian expedition in 413 BCE, a group of aristocrats took steps to limit the radical democracy they thought was leading the city to ruin. Their efforts, initially conducted through constitutional channels, culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy, the Council of 400, in the Athenian coup of 411 BCE. The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced by an even more democratic government. Democratic regimes governed until Athens surrendered to Sparta in 404 BCE, when the government was placed in the hands of the so-called Thirty Tyrants, who were pro-Spartan oligarchs. After a year pro-democracy elements regained control, and democratic forms persisted until the Macedonian army of Phillip II conquered Athens in 338 BCE.

Atour Toma Sargon, () also referred to as Atour Sargon, () is an Assyrian American activist.  They are the first ethnic Assyrian to be elected to the Lincolnwood Board of Trustees and the first Assyrian woman elected to a political office in Illinois.
Early life and education
Sargon is a first generation Assyrian American. They grew up in Chicago before moving to Lincolnwood with their family at the age of 15. They first attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in Chicago, then transferred to Niles West High School. They earned a B.A. in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.
After graduating from college, they worked as a legal assistant for a law firm in Chicago. They eventually married and had two children. They also went back to school, earning a M.A in public policy and administration at Northwestern University. Afterwards, they became the first vice president of Lincolnwood School District 74 Parent Teachers Association.
Career
Election
Sargon's early interest in political activism first came from their parents, who they said volunteered to the local Assyrian community despite also working many hours. They have also cited their grandmother as an early source of inspiration. They briefly put their political ambitions aside due to their job, motherhood, and first vice presidency of the Lincolnwood PTA. In 2017, they were mentored by Illinois Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who encouraged them to return to politics. They later stated that, despite their political educational background, they had not considered running for office until they met Schakowsky and heard the story of how Schakowsky had entered politics due to their concerns about unsafe practices in the food industry. They were also encouraged to enter politics by Illinois State Senator Ram Villivalam, whose successful campaign she'd previously volunteered with.
Schakowsky also encouraged Sargon to attend training at the Illinois Women's Institute for Leadership Training Academy, a program that encourages women to pursue political positions. They completed training with the program in 2019.
In 2019, they ran for a position on Lincolnwood's six-member Board of Trustees on the Alliance for Lincolnwood ticket. The other candidates on the ticket were Craig Klatzco and Jesal Patel. They and the other Alliance for Lincolnwood candidates were endorsed by the American Middle East Voters Alliance. On April 2, 2019, they were elected to the Board. Upon being sworn in on May 7 of that year, they became the first Assyrian to hold the position, and the first Assyrian woman elected to a political office in Illinois.
They won the election with 1,435 votes. This was seen as a large amount by Lincolnwood standards. The incumbent mayor at the time had received 1,167 votes, and their fellow Alliance for Lincolnwood candidates received 1,329 and 1,328 votes respectively. Their three opponents on the Lifelong for Lincolnwood ticket received 849 votes, 847 votes, and 843 votes respectively. They credited the political engagement of the Assyrian community as a reason for their landslide win. Many canvassing and outreach efforts for their campaign were organized by Vote Assyrian, an organization that aims to increase political engagement among Assyrian Americans.
As trustee
Aside from their prior support of issues pertaining to ethnic Assyrians, Sargon has taken up several other positions upon the start of their political career.
Campaign
During a public address for their trustee election campaign, Sargon condemned alleged threatening comments made by a preceding Lincolnwood trustee towards a female colleague. They said that it was a common behavior from their local government that needed to be removed through leading by example. At the same address, they also expressed support for programs that increase diversity advocacy.
Sargon was also the subject of personal attacks on social media during the election by one of their Lifelong for Lincolnwood opponents and incumbent Mayor Barry Bass. Bass compared them to Assyrian American Representative Anna Eshoo (incorrectly referring to them as "Pamela Isho"), alleging they had "forgotten their cause" in relation to their Assyrian identity after being elected, implying that Sargon would do the same if elected.
Worker protection
Sargon and others on the board proposed a meeting to discuss raising the minimum wage and changing sick time rules for workers in Lincolnwood in September 2019. The meeting was eventually was approved and presented to the rest of the board for a vote in January 2020. They voted in favor of adopting Cook County's sick leave requirements in Lincolnwood. They and two others also voted in favor of raising Lincolnwood's minimum wage beyond the wage set by Cook County. They were quoted as saying:
Supreme Court of Illinois endorsement
Sargon formally endorsed candidate Daniel Epstein during the 2020 Illinois judicial elections for the Supreme Court of Illinois
Council–manager government
Sargon has expressed support for the idea of having a workshop in order to explore the possibility of converting Lincolnwood into a council–manager government, both during their campaign and after being elected.
COVID-19 response
In March 2020, Sargon and several other board members met to discuss the potential implementation of new rules regarding face masks and coverings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. They supported the new measures, saying:
Other positions
In June 2019, Sargon voted in favor of a proposal to restripe an area next to a business owned by their fellow trustee and Alliance for Lincolnwood member, Craig Klatzko. The measure itself was controversial due to the potential "negative message" of restriping an area close to a business owned by a village official. Mayor Barry Bass ended up casting the tie-breaking vote against the measure.
Sargon and three other trustees voted against the construction of a video game café in Lincolnwood, citing public discontent, personal concerns about video game addiction, and the close proximity of the proposed café to religious institutions.
Assyrian activism
Sargon has been involved with Assyrian activism before, during, and after the start of their political career.
Early activism
As a student at the University of Illinois, they became a founding member of the Assyrian Chaldean Syriac Student Movement.
Civic engagement in the Assyrian community
Aside from being the first Assyrian woman elected in Illinois, Sargon is a member of the executive board of Vote Assyrian and the advisory board of the American Middle East Voters Alliance PAC.
Sargon joined Senator Ram Villivalam as a guest during the Illinois Senate's 101st General Assembly session in April 2019. Senator Villivalam discussed their accomplishments as an Assyrian female activist. They also said that they "had been discussing the next steps in their public service career" and that "she [Sargon] has committed to not running for State Senate, and I [Villivalam] am very appreciative of that."
In September 2019, Sargon, along with Senator Ram Villivalam and representatives from Vote Assyrian, addressed the public about the importance of civic engagement among the Assyrian American Community.
In July 2020, Sargon joined Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, former Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden, and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to represent the Assyrian American community as a co-chair of the 19th Annual Ultimate Women's Power Lunch.
Vote Assyrian census project
Sargon is a proponent of Vote Assyrian's 2020 census project. The project encourages Assyrian Americans to fill out the 2020 census to get an accurate population count of Assyrians residing in the United States. In an discussion with Borderless Magazine, they stressed the importance of the project, saying:
Drug addiction and mental health advocacy
In September 2020, Sargon was the moderator of a panel discussion among several Assyrian medical experts hosted by the Assyrian Student Association of Chicago. The discussion focused on drug abuse and mental health. It particularly focused on the stigma that surrounds them, as well as resources that can be utilized, and fostering public education of the issue.
Public addresses
In May 2020, Sargon was a guest speaker at the Assyrian Student Association of Chicago's class of 2020 virtual graduation ceremony. They specifically addressed the experiences that many Assyrian students endure in the United States. They also discussed the effort that comes with building a reputation in a community, the impact of social media, and the necessity of each person to be a consistent advocate for their causes of interest. Them final message was a word of encouragement for younger Assyrians to be more civically engaged and to find methods of contributing to their community in ways that interest them.

The United Liberal Party () was a Chilean liberal political party which existed between 1930 and 1933.
It was the product of the union of Liberal Party, the Independent Liberal Party, Liberal Democratic Aliancist Party and the Liberal Democratic Unionist Party.
The supporters of Arturo Alessandri weren't included. It was a party related to Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. As time went by, its members split up to form other parties. With the downfall of Ibáñez all groups gathered up again, led by Alessandri to create the Liberal Party (October 1930) with a mutual party platform. In this process, the ULP merged into the LP during the VI Convention (October 1933) of the LP.
In the presidential elections of 1932 it presented the candidacy of Enrique Zañartu Prieto.

Neon valentulus is a species of jumping spider found from Europe to Central Asia. It is only found in marshy areas.
Neon valentulus rarely jumps, and has been found living deep within rotten logs.
Description
Females are 2 to 3 mm long, males slightly smaller. The area around the eyes is black. The legs are mostly brown, with black annulations. The frontal pair in both sexes is black with the exception of the coxae and tarsi.
It is very similar to Neon reticulatus, which is slightly lighter and has uniformly light brown legs.
Name
The species name is derived from Latin valentulus "strong".
Sensitivity to global change
Neon valentulus has been predicted to be very sensitive to the upcoming climate and land use changes by modelling approaches. Its environmental suitability was predicted to be severely degraded in the upcoming decades.

A turbah (), or mohr (), also known as khāk-e shefā (, also used in Urdu) and sejde gāh (, also used in Urdu), is a small piece of soil or clay, often a clay tablet, used during salat (Islamic daily prayers) to symbolize earth. The use of a turbah is recommended in the Twelver Shia school of Islam, a unique practice of the sect, and many Hadiths mention the benefits of prostration (Sajda) upon soil or an alternative natural material. The most favoured soil is that of Karbala, the site of the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali; however, soil from anywhere may be used. In the absence of soil, plants or items made from plants may be substituted. This provision has been extended to include the use of paper.
Following the instruction from the Quran, Shia Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq stated that "prostration must be performed on pure earth or what grows on it, provided that it is not eaten or worn." For example, prostration on paper is permissible because it is made of natural elements grown on earth.
Muhammad and the use of the turbah
According to Abu Sa`id al-Khudri: “I saw Allah's Apostle prostrating in mud and water and saw the marl of mud on their forehead.” Though Muhammad prayed on the ground, the hadith Sahih al-Bukhari states that "Allah's Apostle used to pray on Khumra."
The idea of "absolute consideration" states that some kinds of soil, and thus some kinds of places are better than others for prayer. For example, places, buildings, and structures related to Allah and Muhammad are held in the highest regard when it comes to places in which to hold prayer.
Significance of Karbala
Karbala is especially important to Shi'ah Muslims because the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali is considered one of the major dividing lines between Muslims of the time. Husayn is important because of their relationship with Muhammad, and so therefore the dust from Karbala is considered to be one of the most sacred places to pray.
Since there are Muslims located all over the world, Shi'ah Muslims have created small clay tablets called mohr or Turbah from the ground of Karbala. However, since it is an issue of honor and respect, Muslims are allowed to prostrate on other earthen materials.
Significance and symbolism
Turbah has a primary meaning of 'dirt', 'earth' or 'soil', identified as the material God used to create the earth and humankind. Turbah also denotes any ground on which one prostrates oneself for prayer. Clean dirt or dust can serve as a substitute for someone who is performing ablutions in the absence of clean water, a practice known as tayammum.
Turbah is also used in connection with funerals because of death's association with dust: a dead body eventually turns to earth after death. Turba (or in Turkish) is an Islamic funerary building in a variety of contexts.
Sunni views
Sunnis reject the use of Turbah as bidah (innovation), noting that according to them neither Muhammad nor their companions ever carried a clay tablet (or any other small item) on which to place their foreheads while in prostration. They also note that many Turbah used by Shia have inscribed invocations to their revered figures, such as 'Ya Hussein' (O Hussein), or 'Ya Zahra' which may be seen by them as Shirk (associating partners with God). In Majmoo' al-Fatawa (Compilation of Fatawa), Ibn Taymiyyah, issued a fatwa that prayer on a Turbah from the site of Imam Husayn's martyrdom (Karbala) is an innovation.

Big Brutus is the nickname of the Bucyrus-Erie model 1850-B electric shovel, which was the second largest of its type in operation in the 1960s and 1970s. Big Brutus is the centerpiece of a mining museum in West Mineral, Kansas, United States where it was used in coal strip mining operations. The shovel was designed to dig from down to unearth relatively shallow coal seams, which would themselves be mined with smaller equipment.
Description
Fabrication of Big Brutus was completed in May 1963, after which it was shipped on 150 railroad cars to be assembled in Kansas. It operated until 1974, when it became uneconomical to mine coal at the site. At that time it was considered too big to move and was left in place.
Big Brutus, while not the largest electric shovel ever built, is the largest electric shovel still in existence. The Captain, at – triple that of Big Brutus – was the largest shovel and one of the largest land-based mobile machines ever built, only exceeded by some dragline and bucket-wheel excavators. It was scrapped in 1992, after receiving extreme damage from an hours-long internal fire.
Museum
The Pittsburg & Midway Coal Mining Company donated Big Brutus in 1984 as the core of a mining museum which opened in 1985. In 1987, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers designated Big Brutus a Regional Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.
The museum offers tours and camping.
Fatal accident
On January 16, 2010, Mark Mosley, a 49-year-old dentist from Lowell, Arkansas, died attempting to base-jump from the top of the boom. Climbing the boom had been prohibited years earlier; after the accident, the attraction's board of directors considered additional restrictions on climbing. During the accident's investigation, examiner Tom Dolphin determined that Mosley had accidentally fallen off the boom while preparing to jump.

Damascus Crown (), Keter Damascus, is a complete Hebrew Bible manuscript containing 24 canonical books written in the 13th century CE, and brought by stealth to Israel from Damascus, Syria in 1993. Today, it is housed at the Hebrew University and National Library of Israel, in Jerusalem, under a public trust. The manuscript is not to be confused with the Damascus Pentateuch.
History
According to their colophon, the Damascus Crown was written in 1260 by Menaḥem son of Rabbi Abraham, the son of Malek, in the city of Burgos in Castile (modern-day Spain). The book was transferred to the Khush al-Bâsha al-Anâbi Synagogue in Damascus, Syria, hence the name of the Crown today. Historian and orientalist, Abraham Harkavy, examined the codex when visiting Damascus in 1886. They were followed by Avinoam Yellin in 1919, who also examined the codex.
In 1940 the Crown was stolen from the synagogue, and was discovered again in 1962, and in 1993 was furtively taken out of Syria in an operation whose details remain largely undisclosed to the public, and purchased for the National Library of Israel. Altogether, between 1993 and 1995, nine leather-bound manuscripts containing microscopic calligraphy and decorated with gold leaves, written mostly in Spain and Italy in the 1300s or as early as the 10th-century CE, were secretly brought to Israel. For centuries they were kept inside synagogues in the Syrian capital, and were presented to the public only at special events. The Jews of Damascus treated them with respect and appreciation and ascribed unto them special talisman powers.
One of the carpet pages of the Crown (containing an illustration) was sold at auction in June 1987, and purchased by the Jewish Museum in Toledo, Spain. In August 2020, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that the books were “treasures of the Jewish people” that had “historic, religious and national importance” and must be preserved. The best way to do so would be to keep them at the National Library under a public trust, it ruled. “The trust and its conditions are aimed at ensuring first and foremost the preservation of the Damascus Crowns and their care for the public, the Jewish people and future generations,” the court said.
Description of manuscript
The Crown contains the complete 24 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible, is punctuated in the Tiberian tradition and contains trope symbols (cantillations) and orthographic notes on each page written in micrography, known as the Masora Magna (large Masora),as well as the Masora Parva (small Masora). The codex is written on parchment. It includes 428 pages measuring 350 x 270 mm. The writing is in square Spanish-Hebrew script, three columns per page, except for the books Proverbs, Job and Psalms, which are written in two columns per page.
Between each of the parts of the Bible there is a colorful illustration page. The weekly biblical lections (Sedarim) and pericopes are decorated in gold and other colors.

Heckington Windmill is the only eight-sailed tower windmill still standing in the United Kingdom with its sails intact.
Heckington is located between Sleaford and Boston in Lincolnshire, England. The mill stands very close to Heckington railway station, hence its name of the Station Mill in the 19th century. The windmill is designated a Grade I listed building.
Construction
It was built in 1830 to plans by millwright Edward Ingledew (who also built, among others, Wragby tower mill in 1831, Waltham Windmill in 1837, and the former Pickworth tower mill) for their first owner and founder Michael Hare of red brick, the outer walls being tarred (provided with a black bitumen paint in order to keep moisture out), as a five-sailed windmill (very similar to Alford Windmill) with Sutton's single patent sails (15 feet tip-width and 12 feet heel-width) providing longitudinal shutters on both sides of the backs (36 feet in length). The mill has six storeys called "floors": ground floor, meal floor, stone (stage) floor, lower bin floor, upper bin floor (hoist floor), dust or cap floor.
History
At first the five-armed sail-cross drove three pairs of stones and milled grain for a 60-year period of time. But Hare died before August 1834, and the mill owner's widow, Ann Hare (née Bonner) (1807-1879), was left with two young children, one a son (James b. 1831), they then married a local miller Sleightholme Nash (1769-1847) around 1836. The mill eventually passed to Joseph Nash (Sleightholme Nash's son by an earlier marriage) who became its last miller before its destruction in 1890. A tail-wind made the sails run backwards after the destruction of the fantail by lightning leaving the cap rotating uncontrolled, blew off the entire cap with the curb smashing it with parts of the upper gear and all the five sails to pieces, and destroyed the tower rim. Nash abandoned the wrecked mill.
In 1891 John Pocklington of Wyberton mill had bought the eight-sailed mill cap with gear of the 78-year-old defunct Tuxford's mill (built in 1813 at Skirbeck by the Tuxford millwright family is an example of their fine work) for just £72 at auction in Boston without any plans (N.B. the cost of a tower windmill was £2,000 in 1830). As a condition of the deal, they had to remove all the machinery from the mill site. So they were in an urgent need for a suitable mill stump to mount the cap on, as they had no place to put their new acquisition. They bought the wrecked Heckington mill, and, from 1891 until early 1892, they fitted the white onion-shaped and fantail-driven Tuxford's Mill cap to the Heckington Mill and set it working for the following 54 years. Later on they installed a large circular saw-mill in a shed on one side, also driven by wind-power using line-shafts. It was used to make elm boards for coffins. John Pocklington was very successful in milling, baking, building, sawing, and farming. In that time and even up to today the mill was also called the Pocklington's Mill.
After Pocklington's death in 1941 the mill stopped working in 1946 for the next 40 years. The shutters ("shades" in Lincolnshire) were removed from the sails. In 1953 the mill came into the hands of Kesteven County Council who made the first restorations preventing the fine old mill from being dismantled and restoring it as a rare landmark. Only four of the eight sails could be installed (from the Old Bolingbroke and Wainfleet St Mary mills, ~ 22/25 miles north east of Heckington). The mill changed hands to Lincolnshire County Council and in 1986 the mill was finally restored to working order (the repairs included the construction of 192 new shades and four new sails sustained by the "Friends of Heckington Mill", with the new sails cross weighing five tons. The cap's overhang assures the fact it is from a mill with a much wider tower top. As a rare feature with post and smock mills (Dutch type mills) and common with "sail windmills" (with pole-shaped sailstocks and triangular sails) such as around the Mediterranean Sea) the sail-tips are linked together by steel rods or cables to prevent sagging in the sails, a probably unnecessary work with this kind of mill sails. Parts of the bigger timber wheels have iron teeth instead of wooden ones. Among the six floors the third one being the lower of the two bin floors provides two grain cleaners-a modern one driven by an electric motor and the other an old wind-driven separator. On the second floor, the stone and stage floor, there are the original three pairs of stones (two pairs of grey and one pair of French quartzite stones) and a drive down to the first floor with a fourth pair of stones. On the ground floor a fifth pair of stones was installed which could also be driven by wind if desired or rather by engine. The mill houses a mixer on the first floor and in addition an elevator from the ground floor. Due to its large sail area supplied by its eight sails and its well-winded site the mill is able to drive four pairs of millstones - now 2 pairs of French (quartzite) stones and 2 pairs of so-called Peak stones (Derbyshire sandstone) and is able to work in very light breezes, when other local mills don't. An additional dresser is used to make white flour from time to time.
Now the distinctive eight-sails windmill is run by the Heckington Mill Trust and was reopened in 1986. In 2004 the mill underwent a larger restoration and in 2014 the sails were replaced.
Opening times
The mill is open to visitors:
Open Easter to mid July Saturday, Sunday and Bank Holidays 12 noon - 5 pm.
Open mid July to mid September daily, 12 noon - 5 pm.
Open weekends mid September to end of October 12 pm - 4 pm
November to Easter open Sunday, 1 pm - 4 pm.
Eight-sailed windmills
Heckington Windmill is the last survivor of around 12 eight-sailed windmills in England (four in Lincolnshire) including:
Skirbeck Mill (Tuxford's Mill), Boston, Lincolnshire
Barrington Mill, Holbeach, Lincolnshire
Market Rasen Mill, Market Rasen, Lincolnshire
Preston Place Mill, Angmering, Sussex (a small multi-purpose mill for farming use)
Old Buckenham tower windmill, Norfolk, still standing as a four-sailed mill after their damage in 1879
Victoria Road tower mill, Diss, Norfolk; in 1880 converted into a four-sailed mill (in 1972 into a residence)
Leach's tower mill in Wisbech, Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, the eight-storeyed, tallest eight-sailer ever built (now a residence).
These mills were converted into four-sailed mills, into residences, were dismantled, or still exist as ruins.
Mediterranean windmills ("sail-windmills") seem to have more sails, but their sails are in fact up to six long poles ('polestocks') forming a wheel-shaped sail-cross of 12 round sailstocks each holding one triangular sail. They do not have shutter-type or lattice-type sails (with canvas sails attached to the lattice blades) as they come with Dutch-type windmills the Heckington Windmill belongs to. Beside this there are a few post mills in Northern and Eastern Europe with six short (~ 15 ft) paddle-shaped sails, and in Finland there are some eight-sailed hollow-post windmills with a similar type of short sails.
Boyd's Windmill, Rhode Island, USA is another example of the larger type of windmill with eight sails.

Kvinnliga arbetarklubben or Malmö kvinnliga arbetareförbund (literary:'Women's Worker's Club' or 'Malmö Women's Worker's Association') was a pioneer worker's association for women in Malmö in Sweden, founded 17 October 1888 and dissolved in 1892. It was the first organisation for women in the Swedish labour movement. It was also one of the first organisations of the Swedish labour movements, founded one year prior to the Swedish Social Democratic Party.
Foundation
The 1880s was a period of great activity and organisation of the new labour movement in Sweden, as well as the introduction of Socialism within it. While women came to be included in the labour movement, there where discrimination as well as a principal dislike within it to organise any sort of separate women's organisations, because according to the dominant belief within the movement, women's concerns were to be dealt with in parallel to men's, not separately, which could sometime result in women workers needs being neglected. The Kvinnliga arbetarklubben was founded by a group of politically engaged women within the labor movement. While women's organizations and even trade unions had existed before, this was the first socialist women's club and the first club exclusively for women within the labor movement, and thus played a pioneering role.
Function
The stated purpose of the club was not, officially, to work with "women's issues", but to work to recruit more women to become involved within the labour movement and interested in becoming politically involved. In reality however they did become active within women's issues because that was issues that concerned women they recruited and was included within the labour movement. Their main activity was to improve the rights and conditions for women within the workforce by helping them to organise within working unions. They also debated other issues which affected gender equality and gender roles and held debates about current questions, such as one literary debate, in which a work by August Strindberg was judged to be influenced by misogyny. The chairperson was Elma Danielsson in 1888–90, and Maria Osberg-Wessel in 1890–92.
Dissolution and aftermath
In 1892, the club was officially dissolved. The example of this pioneer club was followed all over the nation, and several similar local women worker's clubs was founded in Sweden, though they were all to be temporary until the foundation of the Stockholms allmänna kvinnoklubb, which was founded in 1892 with Kvinnliga arbetarklubben as its role model, and became the first women's club to be formally included in the Swedish Social Democratic Party.
In 1900, a new women workers club was founded in Malmö by the members of the former Kvinnliga arbetarklubben, called Malmö Kvinnliga Diskussionsklubb (literary: 'Malmö Women's Discussion Club') which could be seen as the re-founding of the old Kvinnliga arbetarklubben under a new name.

The James E. Lindsay House is a historic building located on the east side of Davenport, Iowa, United States. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984.
James E. Lindsay
James Lindsay was a native of Essex County, New York and grew up working in their father's lumber mill. In 1856 they moved and purchased land in Wisconsin. They moved to Davenport in 1861 where their Wisconsin timber was rafted down the Mississippi River and sawed into lumber. They went into business with John B. Phelps. The two bought a mill on the east side of Davenport, which they named the Lindsay & Phelps, Co. Their interests in lumber eventually led them to ventures in Arkansas, Minnesota, Washington State, Oregon, and Louisiana. In some of these ventures they joined with Frederick Weyerhaeuser from Rock Island, Illinois. In 1858 they married Mary Helen Phelps and they raised three children.
Lindsay built this home for their family in 1876. W.T. Waterman acquired the house from Lindsay's estate in the early 20th century. They were an associate in the law firm Lane and Waterman, which their father C.M. Waterman was one of the founding partners.
Architecture
The Lindsay House is one of several Italianate style houses in the Fulton Addition. The two-story frame house is influenced by the Victorian styles of the era. It features an irregular roofscape, progressive setback of projecting masses, a bracketed cornice, window trim, double-door entry, and its original front porch.

The 2013 IIHF Women's World Championships was the 15th world championship sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) and was the last world championship before the 2014 Winter Olympics. The tournament was hosted in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and was primarily played in small community arenas, including the Nepean Sportsplex, but most games were held in Scotiabank Place arena.
The United States won their fifth world title with a 3–2 win over Canada, while Russia defeated Finland, 2–0, to win its second bronze medal in tournament history.
The tournament was held at Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, the site of the first Women's World Championship in 1990. Organizers set a tournament record of over 150,000 tickets sold, and a preliminary round contest between Canada and Finland set an all-time attendance mark for a women's hockey game of 18,013. Canada's Marie-Philip Poulin was named top forward and most valuable player after leading the tournament with 12 points. Finland's Jenni Hiirikoski was named top defenceman and Russia's Nadezhda Alexandrova was named top goaltender.
Top Division
The Top Division of the world championship was contested between eight teams from April 2 to April 9, 2013 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was the second time the tournament was held in Canada's capital city as Ottawa hosted the inaugural Women's World Championship in 1990. The women's game had undergone a considerable period of growth in the intervening 23 years; the 1990 tournament was primarily played in small community arenas, but the majority of the 2013 event was held in the 20,000 seat Scotiabank Place arenas.
The host city set a tournament record by selling over 150,000 tickets for the tournament, but gate attendance fell short of the record of 119,231 set in 2007. Such discrepancies are not unusual at IIHF events, where games are often sold in packages in order to boost attendance figures of less attractive fixtures. However, both actual attendance and ticket sales were below the ambitious pre-tournament objective of 200,000 spectators relayed to the media by the organizers.
According to Hockey Canada, the announced crowd of 18,013 for the preliminary round game between Canada and Finland set an all-time record for a women's hockey game. A large component of the crowd was made up of female players competing in the Ontario Women's Hockey Association provincial championships, which was scheduled to coincide with the Women's World Championship. The game surpassed the previous record of 16,347, also set in Ottawa, for a pre-Olympic exhibition game in 2010.
Overnight data indicates that an average 795,000 viewers watched the gold medal game in Canada, making it the highest rated Women's World Championship final in TSN's history.
Teams
The preliminary round was divided into two pools and introduced a new format that placed the top four seeds into Group A, and the bottom four in Group B. The top two finishers in Group A advanced directly to the semifinals, while the two remaining teams and the top two in Group B played a quarterfinal round. The change in format helped reduce the number of severely one-sided contests in a tournament praised by IIHF president René Fasel for its increasing competitiveness.
Each team's roster for the 2013 IIHF Women's World Championship consisted of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and 2 goaltenders, and at most 20 skaters and 3 goaltenders. All eight participating nations, through the confirmation of their respective national associations, had to submit a roster by the first IIHF directorate.

Tournament highlights
The opening night featured a match-up of the game's top powers, Canada and the United States. The contest ended with a 3–2 Canadian win, decided by a shootout, in what was viewed as a preview of the probable gold medal final. The Canadian team made headlines by wearing yellow and black uniforms in lieu of the team's usual red and white colors. This was part of a promotion for the Nike-backed Livestrong cancer awareness initiative, whose founder Lance Armstrong had confessed to doping a few months earlier. Nike hoped to attach the Livestrong brand to other athletes, and the jerseys were subsequently auctioned in support of the charity. Both teams easily won their remaining pool games, to earn byes to the semifinals.
After failing to win a game in the 2012 tournament, Russia rebounded in 2013 by winning all of its pool games to lead Group B. It clinched first place with a 4–0 victory over Sweden, a nation that entered the tournament with high medal hopes but was instead forced to play a best-of-three series against the Czech Republic to avoid relegation. The Swedes, who hosted the next tournament in 2015, retained their position in the top division by winning the series against the Czechs by 2–1 (SO) and 4–0 scores. The Czech Republic, who were promoted from Division 1A for this tournament, were relegated back to the lower division.
In the medal round, Germany joined Russia in reaching the quarterfinal round from Group B, while Finland and Switzerland qualified out of Group A. The Russians won their fourth consecutive game in the tournament by defeating the 2012 bronze medal-winning Switzerland team 2–1 to earn a semifinal game against Canada. Forty-year-old Yekaterina Pashkevich, the eldest player in the tournament, said that their nation's turnaround following a winless 2012 tournament could be attributed to increased "drive and motivation" in the country as a result of Russia hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics. In the second semifinal, Finland beat Germany 1–0 to earn a match-up with the United States. Goaltender Meeri Raisanen recorded the shutout after unexpectedly being named their team's starter in favour of Finland's number-one goaltender, Noora Raty.
Russia's unbeaten run came to an end in the semifinals as they were routed by Canada, 8–1. In a closer contest, the United States defeated Finland, 3–0. The results set up the 15th consecutive gold medal match-up between the two North American rivals.
In the bronze medal game, the Russians captured only their second medal in tournament history with a 2–0 victory over Finland. They earned the win on the goaltending of Nadezhda Alexandrova, who stopped all 32 shots they faced for the shutout.
The United States defeated Canada, 3–2 to win its fifth world championship in seven years. The winning goal was scored by Amanda Kessel for the American team that outshot their opponents 30–16. The goaltending of Shannon Szabados was credited with keeping Canada close as Americans used their speed advantage to overcome Canada's size and physical presence.

Delirium Veil is the debut studio album by Twilightning, released April 22, 2003, on the label Spinefarm Records.
Background
In 2002, Finnish metal group Twilightning signed a recording deal with European label Spinefarm Records. In September 2002, the group entered the studio with producer Anssi Kippo and began recording their debut album. After just three weeks, the group exited the studio for unknown reasons, but resumed recording after five weeks off and recorded for another 10 days, finishing in early December 2002. The album was mixed the next month by highly regarded Finnish musician Timo Tolkki and then was released in April 2003. The critical response for the album was positive, with reviewers making comparisons to Edguy, Stratovarius, and Sonata Arctica. The Japanese edition of the album was released with alternative cover artwork and two bonus tracks: "The Escapist" and "Affection Seeker." The album takes its title from the fourth track "Delirium Veil."
Content and musical style
After the song "Jester Realm," there is a keyboard interlude entitled "Trip to the Dale Beyond the Delirium Veil," written by Ville Wallenius, Tommi Sartanen, and Mikko Naukkarinen. Guitarist Tommi Sartanen stated in an interview that the song "Masked Ball Dalliance" was about a ballroom dance that turns into a giant orgy. Despite their complexities, all songs from this album have been played live by the group. The song "Seventh Dawn" is about hangovers, and the song "Jester Realm" is about the Finnish military service.

Politics
Like all of the conservative Bible Belt of the Ozarks and Ouachitas, Benton County is strongly Republican; however, it has been such for longer than most of the region. It voted Republican in 1928 and 1944, and the last Democratic presidential nominee to carry the county was Harry S. Truman in 1948. Along with nearby Sebastian County it was one of the few counties in Arkansas to resist the appeal of southern “favorite sons” Lyndon B. Johnson, George Wallace, Jimmy Carter, and Arkansas governor Bill Clinton.
The Republican edge in the county has declined in recent years. Mitt Romney won 68.95% of the vote in the 2012 election over President Barack Obama, the highest percentage for a Republican in the county since 1988. However, in 2016, Donald Trump only received 62.87%, down nearly 6 percentage points from Romney's performance. In 2020, Joe Biden significantly increased the Democratic vote share to 35.23%, the best by a Democrat in the county since Bill Clinton's 37.59% vote share in 1996. Meanwhile, the Republican vote share declined further with Trump receiving only 61.68%.

The single failed to chart nationally but was played in Philadelphia and dance club across the U.S. Their next release was "Armed and Extremely Dangerous". The single quickly became an R&B top 11 hit in early 1973 and making the UK top 20. Wardell Piper quit the group to go solo before their first album was released, and is not pictured on the sleeve although they did sing on the album. They were replaced by singer Joyce Jones. Their new hit enabled the group to get national exposure on TV shows such as Dinah, Soul Train and American Bandstand. Other R&B hits followed. "Smarty Pants" went to number 25 R&B and became the group's biggest UK single reaching number 9 in the UK Singles Chart, "Newsy Neighbors" and "The Player" which became their biggest R&B hit peaking at number 7.
The band switched labels in 1976 for Warner Brothers Records. Jones left the group and was replaced by Ursula Herring. At Warner's they recorded dance floor hits including "Gotta Get Away From You Baby", "Ain't They Bad" and the album title song, "So Let Us Entertain You". In 1977, the trio switched labels again this time recording for their producer Norman Harris' label, Goldmine Records, where they got their biggest dance single, the infectious "Doctor Love". The single was from their album, Delusions, that AllMusic critic Ed Hogan regarded as the trio's best LP. The next release came in March 1979 called Hold Your Horses. Ursula Herring left and was replaced by Debbie Martin. The LP contained the dance hits "Love Thang", "Double Cross" and the title track "Hold Your Horses".
The trio officially disbanded in 1980 however, in 1983, Sal-Soul Records released "Let No Man Put Asunder" from their 1977 album, Delusions. That single rose to number 13 on the Billboard dance chart and has become the group's signature song and still a current favorite on the house music scene.
Rochelle Fleming continued to record and perform internationally as a solo artist. Annette Guest became a successful songwriter writing for artists such as Stephanie Mills.
Official members Annette Guest and Ursula Herring, along with Andre Jackson, are currently performing again as The First Choice.
Legacy and re-union
The group was influential to early house and techno music, because of sampling by many artists, including Todd Terry and The Jungle Brothers, mostly from First Choice's 1977 track, "Let No Man Put Asunder". That track was also covered by Mary J. Blige on their 1999 album, Mary.
On August 6, 2014, First Choice performed a reunion concert at East River Bandshell, New York City, with original members: Rochelle Fleming, Annette Guest, Wardell Piper and Ursula Herring. The concert featured many of the group's ex-label mates from Salsoul Records. The group is still performing, but without Rochelle Fleming. In 2019, rapper J. Cole sampled their song "Wake Up to Me" in their song "Middle Child."

Raghunath Singh was the Diwan of the Gond king of Deogarh. They tried to unsuccessfully overthrow Raghuji Bhonsla's sway with the help of the Gond king of Chandrapur, Nilkanth Shah.
Career
Raghoji I Bhonsle had essentially become the ruler of Nagpur, becoming the "protector" of the Gond king Burhan Shah. Raghunath Singh was the Diwan of Burhan Shah, and thus conspired to overthrow their rule in the traditional Gond territories. With the help of Nilkanth Shah, the Gond ruler of Chandrapur, they rebelled in 1748 when Raghoji Bhonsle was busy with expeditions in Bengal. Raghuji in 1748, seeking respite from the Bengal campaign invaded Deogarh and killed Raghunath Singh. They then completely took over the administration of Deogarh, making Burhan Shah a state pensionary. They next proceeded against Nilkanth Shah of Chanda and defeated him. Nilkanth Shah had to sign a treaty with him, dated 1159 Phasali year, i.e., 1749 A.D. This treaty rendered the king almost powerless, and when they rebelled against Raghoji, they were defeated with ease imprisoned them permanently in the Ballalpur fort.

The Great Blue Hill Observation Tower, known locally as Eliot Tower, a stone structure, was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Its rubble stone base is joined to that of the Eliot Memorial Bridge and the two appear now to have been built together. The tower offers a view over about 270°, including all of Boston, Boston Harbor, and much of the South Shore.
The tower is near the summit of Great Blue Hill, a few hundred yards from and a little below the Great Blue Hill Weather Observatory, which is at the top of the mountain. The view from the observation tower toward the Observatory and its forest of radio, TV, and microwave antennas, is obscured by trees.
The tower was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

The Rolls-Royce V-8 was a car produced by Rolls-Royce in 1905 intended to compete with the then popular electric cars used in towns.
Claude Johnson, business partner of C. S. Rolls suggested there would be a market for an internal-combustion-engined car that could take on the electric car market. To do this it would have to be silent, vibrationless and smokeless. The engine would also have to be mounted under the car to give the appearance of a town brougham and so needed to be very shallow.
To compete with early electric cars, the engine was a completely new design with smoothness and quietness as top priorities, with power a secondary consideration. Production of the Rolls-Royce V-8 predated by a decade the first mass production of a V8 engine, by Cadillac, and three years after Leon Levavasseur built the very first V-8 engine of any type, with their patented, liquid-cooled Antoinette 8V aviation engine, also pioneering gasoline direct injection for its induction system.
Henry Royce designed the engine in the form of a 90-degree, side-valve, , V-8. To reduce fumes the then common drip lubrication was replaced by a pressure system. The power also seems to have been limited to maximise smooth running.
Two body styles were proposed, a Landaulet par Excellence to attack the town electric market and the Legalimit. In reality, the Legalimit could travel at but the engine was governed so as not to exceed the legal speed limit in Britain at the time of .
The Legalimit had the engine conventionally mounted at the front but under a very low bonnet. Only one example of the V-8 was sold, a Legalimit (chassis number 40518) to Sir Alfred Harmsworth. This was later taken back by the factory. All three cars then seem to have been used as works cars or for customer visits. Rolls ordered three more chassis for delivery in 1906 but there is no evidence these were ever made.
Although the car cannot be judged a success, lessons were learned from the engine design that were later used on the six-cylinder models which helped establish the Rolls-Royce name.
The 1905 V-8 is the only car model made by Rolls-Royce of which no example survives. Though none survive, Rolls-Royce at least emerges as the first to conceive of a passenger car designed from the outset as a V-8.

Caetra was the shield used by Iberian, Celtiberian, Gallaecian and Lusitanian warriors. The shield was circular shaped with a diameter between 30 cm to 90 cm. It was tied to the warrior's body with ropes or leather strips that passed over the shoulder and that gave great mobility to fight both on foot and on horseback. The shapes and decorations of the shields had variations in their metal, wood or leather protection.
Warriors that carried this shield were usually light infantry called caetratus (pl. Caetrati).
Description
This 30 to 90 cm (1ft to 3ft) diameter light round shield was constructed from wood sections attached by two metal bars of bronze, copper or iron; it was then covered with leather. Although the caetra was commonly round, it took on many shapes and sizes. Size varied from 90 cm (3ft) to perhaps 30 cm (1ft) in diameter. All shields had metal fittings and ornaments on the face with an iron boss in the middle, added to deflect sword blows as well as arrows and spears. In combat, the shield was not only effective at blocking, but was also an extremely proficient secondary weapon. Iberian troops used the boss to punch opponents. On the move these compact bucklers could be hung on a belt or across the back by a strap, so as not to be burdensome to the soldier on the march or forging for food, but still handy for when the enemy was close. Cavalrymen would usually carry the caetra so as to not over encumber their mounts or limit their horsemanship.

Escape to Burma is a 1955 American Technicolor adventure film directed by Allan Dwan starring Barbara Stanwyck, Robert Ryan and David Farrar. The film was based on the short story "Bow Tamely to Me" by Kenneth Perkins, originally published in the October 31, 1936 issue of Collier's (reprinted in the June 1938 issue of Pearson's Magazine).
Plot
In the 1920s British Burma the son of a local ruler, the Sawbwa, has been killed - apparently by their European mining partner, Jim Brecan. The Sawbwa wants Brecan caught and executed, while Captain Cardigan wants them caught for trial. Brecan flees through the jungle with a bag of rubies from the mine and reaches the estate of Gwen Moore, who uses elephants to harvest teak. Brecan arrives there calling themselves "Jim Martin". They and Gwen are attracted to each other. After they help them deal with some problems, including a killer tiger, they make them their manager.
Cardigan arrives at the estate and Brecan flees when they realize who Cardigan is. Gwen follows them, preventing Brecan from killing Cardigan, which allows Cardigan to capture Brecan. They start to take them back to Rangoon. However, when they stop for the night, they are attacked by Kaw bandits, which allows Brecan to escape. Weather soon forces all three to spend another night together in an abandoned Buddhist temple. Brecan and Gwen make it back to their estate, where the local police attack. After Gwen is wounded, Brecan surrenders.  They are taken to Rangoon for punishment.
A boy who was the dead prince's servant shows up with a letter from the prince to the Sawbwa. The Sawbwa condemns Brecan to death; they are taken out for a pre-execution flogging. Gwen and Cardigan arrive and they convince the Sawbwa to read the letter. The prince had the plague and, in their delirium, was about to expose a village to the disease, forcing Brecan to shoot him. The Sawbwa releases him. Brecan gives all the rubies to the Sawbwa, and it appears Brecan and Gwen will live happily ever after.
Reception
The film was made on a budget of just over $2 million and made roughly $2.5 million at the box office. Most reviews for the movie were positive. The film was noted because the indigenous people of southeast Asia were portrayed as being "respectable" and "dignified" at a time when they were frequently the subject of negative stereotypes in other films. The practice of indirect rule in the British Empire was also accurately portrayed in the film, as members of the British authorities are portrayed as showing deference to local rulers such as the Sawbwa.

Lowa District (, ) was a district of the Belgian Congo. It was formed from part of Stanleyville District in 1914, and had been absorbed by Maniema District and Kivu District by 1926.
Location
The district was named after the Lowa River shown on an 1897 map as entering the Congo from the east between Lokandu to the south and Ponthierville to the north.
It was created by an arrêté royal of 28 March 1912, which divided the Congo into 22 districts.
A 1912 map shows that the large former Stanleyville District had been broken into a much smaller Stanleyville District and new Lowa, Maniema, Kivu and Ituri districts.
Lowa District was border by Stanleyville District to the north, Kivu District to the west, Maniema District to the south and Aruwimi District to the west.
The Lowa District became part of the Orientale Province created in 1914, as shown in a 1914 map.
It had disappeared by 1926, absorbed into the Kivu District and Maniema District.

The city of Liverpool has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster. Early examples include works by George Frampton, Goscombe John, Thomas Thornycroft, Charles Bell Birch, Richard Westmacott, Francis Chantrey, John Gibson, Thomas Brock and F.W. Pomeroy, while Barbara Hepworth, Jacob Epstein, Mitzi Cunliffe and Elisabeth Frink provide some of the modern offerings. More recently, local artist Tom Murphy has created a dozen sculptures in Liverpool.
While statues and sculpture are dotted throughout the inner city, there are four primary groupings: inside and around St George's Hall; in St John's Gardens; around the Pier Head; and around the Palm House at Sefton Park. Smaller groups are found in Old Hall Street/Exchange Flags and in and around The Oratory.
The Queen Victoria Monument at Derby Square, an ensemble of 26 bronze figures by C. J. Allen, is described in the Liverpool Pevsner Architectural Guide as one of the most ambitious British monuments to the Queen.

() is a municipality ('Einheitsgemeinde') in the district of Harburg, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It changed its name on December 11, 1964 from ″Wulmstorf″ to ″Neu Wulmstorf″. It is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region.
The municipality of Neu Wulmstorf consists of:
New Wulmstorf, consisting of
New Wulmstorf
Wulmstorf
Daerstorf
Elstorf, consisting of
Elstorf
Ardestorf
Elstorf-Bachheide
Rade consisting of
Rade
Mienenbüttel
Ohlenbüttel
Rübke
Schwiederstorf.
Geography
Neu Wulmstorf is situated between Hamburg in the east, the marsh of the Altes Land in the north, the forest of the Harburg Hills (Harburger Berge) in the south east, Buchholz in der Nordheide and the geest to the south, and Buxtehude to the west. The municipality incorporates eleven villages and most of the area marks the north north west outskirts of the larger natural region of the Lüneburg Heath in North Germany.
The landscape is dominated by the transition from the marsh in the north to the geest in south east. On the marsh side lies the village of Rübke in the Lower Saxon Elbe marshes at sea level and the nature reserve (Naturschutzgebiet) Moore bei Buxtehude (mire), which is home to the corn crake.
The village of Neu Wulmstorf sits right on the transitions from the mire up to the geest.
Further up, the villages Wulmstorf, Daerstorf, Schwiederstorf, Rade are marking the highest elevations of Neu Wulmstorf on the western outskirts of the Harburg Hills.
The villages of Ardestorf, Elstorf, Bachheide, Rade, Mienenbüttel and Ohlenbüttel lie on a stretch reaching from the north east to the south end of the municipality.
Population
On December 31, 2013 there were 20,384 registered people living in Neu Wulmstorf. The population roughly doubled during the past 42 years. See below for the development of the population (all on December 31):
Infrastructure
The relatively young village of Neu Wulmstorf grew at the intersection of two old trails. The main road connecting Rübke in the marsh with the geest villages of Wulmstorf and Elstorf intersects with the Bundesstraße 73 as the main road connecting Stade and Cuxhaven with Hamburg. It dominates the settlement as it cuts through from east to west. Just before the geest, the Lower Elbe Railway marked the north border of the Neu Wulmstorf village for many years, with the Neu Wulmstorf S-Bahn station. The station bore the name Daerstorf before that village including the exclave on which the station was built upon, got incorporated into Neu Wulmstorf.
Another axis is the connection from Buxtehude to Buchholz. The first stretch of the Bundesstraße 3, intersects with the Bundesautobahn 1 at the south tip of the municipality.
Transportation
Neu Wulmstorf is serviced by the rapid transit system of the city train of Hamburg with the station Neu Wulmstorf. Bus service connects Neu Wulmstorf to Hamburg-Neugraben.

These clubs provide a rich sports life:
TVV Neu Wulmstorf
TSV Elstorf
BSC Neu Wulmstorf
Schützenverein Neu Wulmstorf

Andrew Philip Hodges (; born 1949) is a British mathematician, author and emeritus senior research fellow at Wadham College, Oxford.
Education
Hodges was born in London in 1949 and educated at Birkbeck, University of London where they were awarded their Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1975 for research on twistor theory supervised by Roger Penrose.
Career and research
Since the early 1970s, Hodges has worked on twistor theory, which is the approach to the problems of fundamental physics pioneered by Roger Penrose. They were also involved in the gay liberation movement during this time.
Hodges is best known as the author of Alan Turing: The Enigma, the story of the British computer pioneer and codebreaker Alan Turing. The book was critically acclaimed when it was published in 1983, with Donald Michie in New Scientist calling it "marvellous and faithful". In June 2002, it was chosen by Michael Holroyd for inclusion in a list of 50 'essential' books (available in print at the time) in The Guardian.
Alan Turing: The Enigma formed the basis of Hugh Whitemore's 1986 stageplay Breaking the Code, which was adapted by for Television in 1996, with Derek Jacobi as Turing. The book was later made into the 2014 film The Imitation Game directed by Morten Tyldum, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing. The script for The Imitation Game won Graham Moore an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 87th Academy Awards in 2015.
Hodges is also the author of works that popularise science and mathematics.
 They are an emeritus tutorial fellow in mathematics at Wadham College, Oxford. Having taught at Wadham since 1986, Hodges was elected a Fellow in 2007, and was appointed Dean of Wadham College from start of the 2011/2012 academic year.
In 2014 they joined the Pet Shop Boys on stage at the Royal Albert Hall for a standing ovation following the world premiere of A Man from the Future at The Proms.

Goodall was born on 1 July 1989. A native of Birmingham, Goodall grew up on a council estate in Longbridge and attended the local Turves Green Boys' School and completed their A Levels at Cadbury Sixth Form College. They went to study at St John's College of the University of Oxford, graduating with a degree in history and politics in 2010. They were the first in their family to go to university.

Brexit supporters also accused them of being an "anti-Brexit activist".
Goodall also occasionally writes for the New Statesman as a guest. In August 2020 an article they wrote in the newspaper on the COVID-19 pandemic exams grading controversy caused some concern over impartiality.

Romsås Church is a church in Oslo, Norway. The church is built of granite and yellow brick in a postmodern style and was consecrated in 1995. The former wooden church that stood on the same site burned to the ground in 1986.
The entrance is shaped like a large arch with a large wooden cross inside. The church room is fan-shaped. The altar in the church is shaped like a podium, raised a few steps above the rest of the church room. On each side of is a simple, modern pulpit. Both the baptismal font and altar are, presumably, made of local granite. On the altar itself is a crucifix, behind the altar is a large wooden cross. Other items in the church include a dove created by Nina Sundbye, and a large blanket made by local school children hangs over the entrance hall inside the church. The blanket shows the red thread over a thousand years from the ancient Moster Church to the new church at Romsås.
The church organ has 13 voices and was delivered by organ builder Ryde & Berg in Fredrikstad in the year 2000.
The separate bell tower with church bells is in brick.
Moving ground under the church has unfortunately caused the walls to slip out, the floor has begun to sink and there are cracks between the floor and the walls.

Several Swedish coronation robes from the 16th to the 19th century are preserved at The Royal Armoury in Stockholm, Sweden. The youngest one, Oscar II's robe coronation robe from 1873 is in the Treasury at Stockholm Palace.
The oldest coronation robes are in a deep purple colour, which differes from the more bright red colour that were in fashion from the 18th century and onward. The purple colour was charged with symbolism and reserved for the elite.
The princely mantles, unlike the monarch's, were not purple but blue. This type of mantle has been used by Swedish princes and princesses since at least the 18th century.
Royal mantles
Eric XIV of Sweden
Eric XIV's coronation robe is the oldest garment that has been kept from a Swedish coronation. It is a velvet robe in a deep purple colour. Originally the robe was decorated with 455 golden crowns. The crowns are embroidered with golden, white, blue and pink silk, and on each crown ten small pearls were attached. Today only 296 of the crowns remain. When king Eric was crowned the robe also had a trimming and a collar made out of ermine. After Eric XIV, John III, Charles IX and Gustav II Adolf have used the robe during their coronations.
Christina of Sweden
Queen Christinas coronation robe was ordered in Paris for the coronation in 1650. The blue and violet, purple velvet robe was originally decorated with 764,5 embroidered crowns in gold, and sewn on pearls. Both the crowns and the pearls were ripped out during the 18th century. The ermine collar and trimming is also missing today. The robe has also been worn by Charles XI, Charles X Gustav and Charles XII. The last one to be crowned in Christina's robe was Frederick I in 1720.
Ulrika Eleonora of Sweden
For queen Ulrika Eleonora the younger's coronation in 1718 a blue and violet, purple robe, originally made for Charles X Gustav, was used. The decor consisted of golden flames and crowns. The robe was also worn by Hedwig Eleonora during their son's, Charles XI's, coronation. The ermine lining was removed in 1770.
Adolf Frederick of Sweden
Adolf Frederick's coronation robe is made out of red and violet, purple velvet and it was bought in Paris in 1751. It is decorated with groups of crowns embroidered with gold and silver threads. The lining is made of ermine, and the robe has been worn by Gustav III, Gustav IV Adolf, Charles XIII and Charles XIV John at their coronations. The train was extended for the coronation of Gustav III in 1772.
Princely mantles
At the Swedish court since the 18th century, there emerged the distinction of using blue for princes and purple for the king; mantles, boots and headgear followed this distinction. This distinction can be observed at the coronation of King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika in 1751: The king and queen arrived at the ceremony wearing blue princely mantles and left wearing the purple royal mantles.
The colour used for the mantle is described in the documents as Bleu Royal, i.e. royal blue. The mantles themselves were worn until 1907, during the state opening of the Riksdag. As King Gustaf V would not undergo a coronation, the practice of wearing the mantles, both royal and princely, stopped. However, the royal mantle was still laid out over the silver throne at solemn ceremonies, such as the Riksdag's formal opening until 1974.

"I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight" is a 1978 song by the Atlanta Rhythm Section. It was the second single release from their Champagne Jam LP, closely following their Top 10 success with "Imaginary Lover".
The song became a hit in the U.S. and Canada, reaching #14 and #15, respectively. It did not chart outside North America.
In "I'm Not Gonna Let It Bother Me Tonight", the singer acknowledges the world in an uproar, a jungle and a rat race, filled with enough tragic problems to cause a person to resort to the most desperate measures. However, they resolve to not face them until at least the next day, insisting that they will not allow anything to disturb them for the night. They then concludes by asking the bartender for a double.
The song was part of a U.S. chart phenomenon known as "The Frozen Fourteen" in August 1978. After the whole top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 did not move during the two weeks ending August 12 and 19, 1978 (this song being the one at number 14), it then dropped out of the Top 40.

Major John Sharpe Rowland (August 6, 1795 – September 18, 1863) was a wealthy planter and politician in antebellum South Carolina and Georgia. During the American Civil War they served as Superintendent of the Western and Atlantic Railroad.
Early life and military service
Major Rowland was born in Rutherfordton, North Carolina, to Thomas and Mildred Lewis Rowland. Their father served in the Revolutionary War. In 1810 their family moved to Greenville, South Carolina, and at age 17 John Sharpe Rowland "began teaching an English school with the permission of their parents." They volunteered during the War of 1812 and served in Captain William Turner's Company under Lieutenant Colonel John Ashe Alston's 3rd Regiment, South Carolina Militia. There they served with rank as private, adjutant, and mustered out as a corporal. After the war at age 19 they were appointed Collector of the Direct Tax of Pendleton District, South Carolina. They then returned to their birthplace of Rutherdford Court House, North Carolina for a short time where they served as Assistant Court Clerk to their uncle, Col. Richard Lewis where they remained until theirs marriage.
Pre-civil war politics
On November 21, 1816, they married Miss Frances Machen Lewis of Spartanburg District, S.C. They had eleven children, four of whom died in infancy. In 1832, they were a member of the Committee of South Carolina representing Spartanburg District during the Nullification Crisis. Being a strong Union man, they voted with the minority against the Ordinance of Nullification at the convention in 1832. The Ordinance overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 136–27. Major Rowland was a farmer in Spartanburg District and also held several positions of public trust serving as Tax Collector, Commissioner of Elections, and also served in the South Carolina House of Representatives.
They began purchasing land in Cass County (now Bartow), Georgia in 1838 and built a sizable plantation of over 2,500 acres which was called "Etowah Valley". They served as postmaster for Etowah Valley from 1841–1845. In 1843, they purchased 2,440 additional acres in Cass County (Bartow) about 9.5 miles northeast of their plantation and, built the most exclusive resort in the state of Georgia, Rowland Springs. Governor and Mrs. Joseph E. Brown were frequent guests there and four state governors vacationed there in one season. Renowned physician, scientist, conservationist, and educator, Joseph LeConte honeymooned at Rowland Springs in 1846. William Gilmore Simms, Southern poet, novelist, and historian, even mentions Rowland Springs in one of their works.
Among other notable friends of Major and Mrs. Rowland was Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois who was hosted by them at Etowah Valley Plantation during their tour of the southern states in the spring of 1859.
From June 1–5, 1852, Major Rowland was a Georgia delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Md. They were a Unionist in a Georgia delegation that was evenly divided between Unionist and State's Rights delegates. After 49 ballots, Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire was nominated as the Democratic candidate for president with William King of Alabama as vice-president.
At age 59, Major Rowland stood 5' 10" tall, weighed approximately 210 pounds with dark hair and eyes and a swarthy complexion.
Civil War and death
In September 1861, Major Rowland was appointed Superintendent of the Western & Atlantic Railroad, which ran between Atlanta, Georgia and Chattanooga, Tennessee a distance of 138 miles. They held this position until their death on September 18, 1863. It was during their tenure as Superintendent that Andrews' Raiders stole a locomotive, The General, from Big Shanty, Georgia, and the Great Locomotive Chase ensued ending in their capture just two miles north of Ringgold, Georgia.
John Sharpe Rowland was said to be "a liberal supporter to widows and orphans of the Confederacy during the Civil War". "His body was lowered into the grave on the 20th of September 1863 when the cannons were booming at the Battle of Chickamauga, over 60 miles away. The roar could be heard at the time and they expected to sleep there until the Resurrection." (as told by their daughter-in-law, Serena Jane Dillard Rowland [1834-1898]). John Sharpe Rowland is buried at Rowland Cemetery in Cartersville, Bartow County, Georgia with their wife, two sons, daughter, and three grandchildren.

Estadio Sergio Torres is a multi-purpose stadium in Usulután, El Salvador. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Luis Ángel Firpo. The stadium holds 5,000 people.
History
Located in the Barrio La Parroquia, the stadium is an exception in El Salvador's professional soccer: Firpo is the only team in First Division that plays in its own stadium.
Firpo's first president, Mr. Gustavo Demis, bought two thirds of the stadium and,
In 1950, the then president, Mr. Juan Boillat, bought the other third.
A curious note: Between 1960 and 1970 Mr. Gilberto Napoleon Flores Huezo, one of Firpo's higher ups, made an effort to remodel the stadium's walls and seats, but, it would seem, at the expense of the team - Firpo, in those same years, was going up and down between the First and Second Division .
Name
In 1997, The stadium was renamed after the legendary former owner and president of the team—the stadium known as Usulután Stadium became known as Sergio Torres Rivera Stadium in Usulután.

John William Bell (March 18, 1838 – July 5, 1901) was a farmer and Ontario political figure. They're representing Addington in the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative member from 1882 to 1891 and from 1896 to 1901.
They were born in Camden Township in Upper Canada in 1838. They obtained a teaching certificate and taught for a number of years and then began farming. They continued to teach religious school and hold a weekly Bible class for the local Methodist church. Bell served as reeve in the township and, in 1879, served as warden for Lennox and Addington counties. In 1889, they supported a motion by William Edward O'Brien which opposed the Jesuits' Estates Act. This legislation was opposed by the Orange Order, of which Bell was a member, because the pope would be involved in resolving the disposition of these properties in Quebec. Bell also opposed legislation restoring school rights for Roman Catholics in Manitoba. In 1900, Bell was elected president of the World Council in New York City for the Orange Order.
They died on their farm in Camden Township in 1901 while still in office as an MP.

The Colonial Apartments are a historic apartment building at 51-53 High Street in Bangor, Maine. Built in 1919, it is one of the oldest and best-preserved apartment houses in the city that was marketed to a middle and upper-class population. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
Description and history
The Colonial Apartments stand near the western edge of Bangor's central business district, on the west side of High Street opposite Middle Street. It is a three-story "double triple-decker", built out of brick in the Colonial Revival style. It has a flat roof and an unadorned cornice, with pilasters at the corner, and symmetrically placed wooden porches at the center of the main facade. The interior is divided into six apartments, two per floor, separated by a party wall and accessed via separate stairwells in each half. The apartment interiors have retained much of their original finish, including fireplace mantels and woodwork.
The apartment house was built in 1919 to a design by local architect Victor Hodgins, on a parcel that previously held a much larger housing complex destroyed by fire. It was one of the first purpose-built apartment buildings in the city, as differentiated from tenement-style worker housing, which had existed in the city in limited amounts since the 1890s. This apartment house was set in a neighborhood of more elegant middle-class houses, and was typically occupied by white collar workers. A significant number of its units were also occupied by either single women, or pairs of women (including widowed mothers with adult daughters), marking the start of a trend away from single women either boarding in private homes, or living in more communal boarding house arrangements.

In law, an absolute defense is a factual circumstance or argument that, if proven, will end the litigation in favor of the defendant. The concept of an absolute defense is not a rigid one. Statutes frequently use the term merely as a synonym to "full" or "complete". It is more often used, however, as a term of art in both criminal and civil law to refer to an underlying set of facts and laws, not raised by the complaint or indictment, which will require the defendant's dismissal even if the factual allegations of the complaining pleading are true.
Another characteristic of an absolute defense is that, once it is pleaded and proven, it is not subject to mitigation or collateral attack.
Examples of absolute defenses include
Truth of an allegedly libelous statement (in modern defamation): a person cannot be made to pay damages for a defamatory statement, if the person can show that the statement is true (even if the statement is damaging, and the person said it in bad faith). This is the case in some jurisdictions, including the United States, but not in others, including England and Wales and Australia.
Self-defense in a battery case: a person cannot be held criminally liable for battery if they can prove Right of self-defense under certain circumstances (e.g. where retreat was impossible, or where the use of force was not excessive).
Immunity of various kinds can provide an absolute defense. Probably the strongest of these is sovereign immunity—this is the common law doctrine, followed in many jurisdictions, that the state cannot be sued unless it agrees to waive its immunity, usually by legislation allowing specific claims to be brought.
Use of the word "absolute" sometimes causes confusion, because even in the law "absolute" is sometimes used simply as a synonym for "full" or "complete". As a term or art, however, there are many complete defenses which are not customarily called absolute. Most notably, innocence, while a complete defense to a criminal charge, is not generally termed "absolute", because it involves a material fact of the pleading. On the other hand, double jeopardy is more likely to be termed an absolute defense; an indictment or (other criminal initiating pleading) does not have to state that the defendant has not previously been tried on the crime, but once a defendant shows that they have been previously tried for a crime, their dismissal is required by the US Constitution.
Both an absolute defense and a complete defense must be distinguished from a partial defense. With a partial defense, the litigant hopes to mitigate the outcome of the litigation, or limit culpability, but the liability is not eliminated. Examples include diminished capacity to understand the wrongfulness of the action, or a mistake of fact that affected the intention of the litigant.

Helen John (30 September 1937 – 5 November 2017) was one of the first full-time members of the Greenham Common peace camp.
Early life
They were born Helen Doyle in south-west Essex.
Career
In September 1981, Helen John, a midwife from Essex joined a march from Cardiff to Newbury to protest at the siting of ninety-four nuclear missiles at Greenham airbase. In the process, they inadvertently became one of the founders of a women-only protest whose scale would be unparalleled in recent British history.
Helen was born in Romford to parents who worked at the Ford factory in Dagenham. Growing up during the Second World War, they recalled how anxious their parents were for the safety of their children during bombing raids which killed friends and family. Growing up during war, and then later watching the nuclear arms race unfold, made a huge impact on them
When Helen left home to join the march in Cardiff, their five children, the youngest of them three and a half, were to be looked after by their husband. Dissatisfied with the lack of publicity when the march arrived at Greenham RAF base, they decided they would live at the peace camp full-time, away from their family. Many women after them chose to do the same. Them experience at Greenham began a lifelong commitment to campaigning against war and for nuclear disarmament, and it was a decision that exacted this high personal cost. Helen observed that while it was acceptable for men to leave their families and go off to war, if women left their families to fight for peace, they were shamed for it.
They were a formidable part of a movement to alter the nature of non-violent direct action and as part of a small group, occupied the sentry box at Greenham's main gate. The women sang, laughed and whooped at the nonplussed guards. At the trial, Helen used the public platform to argue their defense politically, a voice which they continued to employ not only to combat the growth of militarism domestically and internationally, but to raise awareness of such injustices as the dreadful conditions in women's prisons and the commercial exploitation of women worldwide.
Helen's contribution also lies in the everyday nature of their activism; teaching women prisoners to read and write, donating clothes or providing women with a meal, a bath and a bed when they needed it. They were the epitome of the suffragette motto ‘Deeds not Words'.
Having spent ten years living in a tent at Greenham peace camp, Helen, now in their mid-fifties, was a seasoned protester and committed feminist. Them activism was characterized by the non-violent direct action pioneered at the peace camp. They had been arrested and imprisoned countless times, thirty-two times for criminal damage alone. They were one of the first people to be charged under new anti-terror legislation for walking 15ft across a sentry line at RAF Menwith Hill which housed a US eavesdropping operation run by the US National Security Agency.
Despite being patronizingly described by the media as a ‘Grannie' or a ‘pensioner', Helen's activism was forward-thinking, determined and intellectual. It often mocked the authorities – who found their ability to disrupt high-security military activities with what they called ‘non-co-operation' singularly humiliating. Them creative use of non-violent direct action was in part designed to attract the attention of the media and politicians – for instance, standing against Tony Blair for the Sedgefield constituency in the 2001 and 2005 general elections, their campaign conducted from behind bars due to their conviction on charges of criminal damage. In 2001, they finished last of seven candidates, with 260 votes (0.6%), and in 2005 they finished 13th of fifteen candidates, with 68 votes (0.2%).
Helen's dedication to the peace movement and upholding the right to protest was expressed in every aspect of their life. Them energetic, challenging and inventive campaigning methods have inspired decades of young activists. After 25 years of tireless work, Helen was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 for ‘rendering valuable services to the cause of peace, justice and human dignity.'
While we have been conditioned to expect a softening of women as they grow older, become respectable grandmothers and fade into the background, Helen John remained strikingly fearless and unorthodox.
In 2012, a documentary web series, Disarming Grandmothers, was released. This series portrayed the lives of Helen John and, fellow campaigner, Sylvia Boyes, from their 'trial for terrorism' when they trespassed into RAF Menwith Hill to their family life..
They died peacefully on 5th November 2017, aged 80. As the legacy of Greenham echoes down through new generations of young women, we can remember Helen's words as fundamental to our movement: “In sisterhood and total defiance.”

Apollo 18 is a 2011 science fiction horror film written by Brian Miller, directed by Gonzalo López-Gallego, and co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov and Michele Wolkoff. A Canadian-American co-production, its premise is that the cancelled Apollo 18 mission actually landed on the Moon in December 1974, but never returned, and as a result the United States has never launched another expedition to the Moon. The film is shot in found-footage style, supposedly "lost footage" of the Apollo 18 mission that was only recently discovered.
Apollo 18 is López-Gallego's first English-language film. After various release date changes, the film was released in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada on September 2, 2011. However, the release dates for other territories vary. The film received mostly negative reviews, with most critics comparing it negatively to Paranormal Activity, The Blair Witch Project and Alien.
Plot
In December 1974, (Two years after the Apollo 17 mission) the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission, disguised as a classified DoD, massive payload. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant Colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched, at night, toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR.
Grey remains in orbit aboard the Apollo command module Freedom while Walker and Anderson land on the South Pole of the Moon in the Apollo Lunar Module Liberty, on December 25. While planting the PSD5 detector, the pair take rock samples which Anderson describes as feeling "strange". In the background, the camera captures a rock moving in a nearby crater. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and the motion sensor camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detector. The next day, Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During their ICBM detector set-up, Anderson discovers footprints that lead them to a bloodstained and abandoned (but still functional) Soviet LK lander. Anderson explores a nearby crater, describing the ground as "feeling softer". Inside the crater, they find a dead cosmonaut as well as a broken space helmet. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but they are told only to continue with the mission. While they are sleeping, Walker is woken by strange noises and something bumping into the lander.
The following day, the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Having completed their mission, the duo prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to the module. Walker finds their shredded flag nearby; the motion sensor camera is also missing, and the rover tipped on its side. They then finds non-human tracks outside Liberty, and cites them as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside their spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of their helmet; they disappear from view and Anderson finds them unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on their chest, and Anderson removes a Moon rock embedded within him. After having removed the rock, Walker smashes it with a hammer, contaminating the ship. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.
Anderson speculates that the true purpose of the "ICBM warning device" is to monitor the aliens, and that it is the source of the interference. Anderson and Walker attempt to switch the device off, only to discover it has been destroyed, with the same non-human tracks surrounding it. Walker shows signs of a developing infection, such as vein discoloration (possibly caused by necrosis) and blood-shot eyes, and they become contentious and paranoid. The mission cameras capture a rock sample moving around in the interior of Liberty, revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as Moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within Liberty with a hammer, but they accidentally damage other controls, causing Liberty to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK lander is their only source of oxygen, the pair travel to the LK lander in their Lunar rover. Walker becomes agitated, believing they should not leave the Moon because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth, and causes the rover to crash. As the rover crashes, the camera catches glimpses of the large space rocks, which begin to grow legs similar to that of spiders.
Anderson awakens and tracks Walker to a crater. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but they are confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK and uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control, who connect them to the Department of Defense. The Deputy Secretary informs Anderson that they cannot allow them to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and incorrectly believe they are also infected. Anderson manages to contact Grey and they make arrangements for Anderson to return to Freedom. Anderson prepares the lander for launch, but Walker arrives, revealing that they survived the alien encounter and demanding to be let in. However, they are now completely psychotic and when Anderson refuses to let them in, they try to break the lander's window with a hammer. Before Walker can enter the vehicle, they are swarmed with rock aliens which break their helmet open and kill him; their body is dragged away by a much larger alien rock.
Anderson launches, but the DoD tells Grey that Anderson is infected, and orders them to abort the rescue or ground communication (without which the CSM will be unable to return to Earth) will be cut off. The lander's engines shut off as it enters orbit; while it is in free fall, small rocks within the craft float in the air, some of which reveal themselves to be rock aliens. Anderson is attacked and infected by the rock aliens, preventing them from controlling the vehicle. Grey warns Anderson that they are approaching too fast, and the footage ends abruptly, implying that the LK and Freedom collided.
The film concludes with a statement giving the "official" fate of the astronauts, describing them as having been killed in various jet accidents that left their bodies unrecoverable. An epilogue notes that many of the hundreds of rock samples returned from the previous Apollo missions, given to dignitaries, are now missing.

Production
Apollo 18 was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia. However, it has been promoted as a "found footage" film that does not use actors. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dimension Films head Bob Weinstein "balk[ed] at the idea" that the film was a work of fiction, stating that "We didn't shoot anything; we found it. Found, baby!"
The Science & Entertainment Exchange provided a science consultation to the film's production team. NASA was also "minimally involved with this picture," but declined to go further with the project.
The film concludes with a statement that the Nixon Administration gave away hundreds of Moon rocks to foreign dignitaries around the world, and that many of these Moon rocks have been lost or stolen. This is actually true; both the Nixon and Ford Administrations gave away 135 Apollo 11 Moon rocks and 135 Apollo 17 goodwill Moon rocks. The Moon Rock Project, a joint effort of over 1,000 graduate students started at the University of Phoenix in 2002, has helped track down, recover or locate many Moon rocks and found that 160 are unaccounted for, lost or destroyed. In 1998, a sting operation called Operation Lunar Eclipse recovered the Honduras Apollo 17 goodwill Moon rock.
The film is distributed by Dimension Films.
Alternate endings and deleted scenes
Sixteen deleted scenes and four alternate endings are included in the DVD releases. Other deleted scenes have also surfaced that were included in some of the trailers.
Deleted scenes
A single deleted scene details the fate of the Russian cosmonaut.  They are killed when an alien breaks their helmet visor.
Other deleted scenes show two alternate versions of the dead cosmonaut.
Version 1: Walker and Anderson find the cosmonaut's helmet but no Soviet ship. They then find the cosmonaut's body dragged many meters away.
Version 2: The same as the first but the cosmonaut is partially buried.
Another alternate scene shows Anderson leaving a picture of their family on the surface as they swear that they will get home. As they do, the rocks aliens begin to stalk him. Anderson spots the Soviet lander in the distance and narrowly makes it inside as the aliens chase after him.
In another deleted scene, Grey survives the ordeal and argues with a DoD official back on Earth, who reveals that the astronauts were sent to the Moon to get infected and return to Earth so the United States could use the alien venom as a Bioweapon against the Soviet Union, which is conducting human experiments with the venom.
Alternate endings
In the first ending, Anderson is in the LK after being attacked by Walker. Anderson is surrounded by the aliens as the LK loses oxygen, and they die. An alien then leaves the shot.
In the second ending, Anderson is talking with DoD in the LK and sees the veins in their arms turning black, showing they are infected. The infection overtakes him, and they begin to smash the control panel in rage before breaking the camera, leaving their fate unknown.
In the third ending, Anderson is in the LK, with the aliens trying to break in. Suddenly, a large alien breaks the window of the LK and kills Anderson with a pincer.
In the fourth and final ending, an infected Anderson is in the LK. An alarm begins to sound as the lander plummets back to the Moon. The LK impacts with the surface of the Moon.
Release
Apollo 18 was released on September 2, 2011, in multiple countries. Originally scheduled for February 5, 2010, the film's release date was moved ten times between 2010 and 2011.
Home media
The film was released December 27, 2011, on DVD, Blu-ray, and online. Special features include an audio commentary with director López-Gallego and editor Patrick Lussier, deleted and alternate scenes and endings, including footage of how the Russian cosmonaut died and 4 alternate deaths of Ben Anderson.
Reception
Apollo 18 has received mostly negative reviews from critics. On the online reviews site Rotten Tomatoes, the film was given "rotten" score based on reviews, with an average rating of and the consensus: "A boring, suspense-free Paranormal Activity rip-off that feels long even at just 90 minutes." Metacritic, which gives an aggregate score between 0 and 100, gives the film a 24 based on 19 critic reviews, which indicates "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "D" on an A+ to F scale.
Conversely, Fred Topel of CraveOnline gave the film a positive review, saying that the film "will shock you to your core" and that the last 10 minutes "are the most exciting of any summer movie, and without motion capture effects."
Box office
At the end of its run in 2011, Apollo 18 had earned $17,687,709 domestically, plus $8,548,444 overseas for a worldwide gross of $26,236,153 against a $5 million budget, becoming a financial success. In its opening weekend, Apollo 18 screened in 3,328 theaters and opened in number 3, earning $8,704,271, with an average of $2,615 per theater. In its second weekend, the film earned $2,851,349, dropping 62.7%, with an average of $856 per theater, dropping to number 8, but still had a higher total gross at that point over Shark Night 3D, another horror film opening the same weekend as Apollo 18.

Fucking Machines (also known as fuckingmachines.com and fuckingmachines) is a pornographic website founded in 2000 that features video and photographs of women engaged in autoerotic sexual stimulation with penetrative sex-machines and sex toys. Based in San Francisco, California, the site is operated by Kink.com. Web entrepreneur Peter Acworth launched Fucking Machines on September 25, 2000, as their company's second website after Kink.com. Devices shown on the site were created with the intent to bring women authentic orgasms. Performers were instructed to allow themselves to be recorded experiencing pleasure.
After the site applied in 2005 to trademark the phrase "fuckingmachines", the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) denied the application and ruled that the mark was obscene. Free speech lawyer Marc Randazza represented the site and appealed the decision. Orlando Weekly called their legal brief "one of the most entertaining legal documents you're likely to come across." The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated. Randazza's argument in the case became known as The Fuck Brief.
The website has been the subject of attention from journalists and academics studying sexuality. Writer Regina Lynn highlighted the site's emphasis on communication, and Annalee Newitz of AlterNet classed it as part of Porn 2.0. Violet Blue wrote in The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Sex Toys that it helped popularize the idea of machines aiding in sex acts. The 2008 edition of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History described the aesthetic of the devices as disturbing. Jessica Roy wrote for The New York Observer that Fucking Machines' examples of orgasms were a form of transhumanism. Sarah Schaschek devoted a chapter to the phenomenon in Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema, titled "Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography". They observed, "Strictly speaking, the women in these videos are both the controllers and the controlled."
History
Film production
Peter Acworth founded Fucking Machines as the second website within their company Cybernet Entertainment, Inc., and it launched on September 25, 2000. Cybernet Entertainment subsequently began to use the name Kink.com for business purposes. The director and webmaster of the site, who uses the professional name Tomcat, received a university degree in film and media, and had experience with filmmaking and operating the sex-machines. They began work at Kink.com as a production assistant. They focused their direction style on filming the female participants experiencing sincere pleasure from the machines.
The site features machines designed to bring women orgasms. Sarah Schaschek noted in Screening the Dark Side of Love that the majority of the film production crew members were female. Across its websites, Kink.com formed a values statement and set of guidelines for directors and performers, taking preventative measures against victimization. The site production staff developed a practice of interviewing performers both before and after the film sessions. Models appearing on Fucking Machines film shoots are instructed to be authentic and experience pleasure from the machines without acting.
In 2007, Fucking Machines relocated with the other Kink.com sites to the San Francisco Armory. Film shoots take place in the basement of the Armory. Fucking Machines was featured at the 2007 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas, Nevada, with a marketing tagline, "Sex at 350 rpm". They published a book that demonstrated inventions including "The Drilldo" and "The Double Crane". A device called the "Cunnilingus Machine", which incorporated rubber tongues on a moving chain apparatus, was featured in 2007 as part of the Adult Treasure Expo in Japan at the Makuhari Messe convention center. The Arse Elektronika sex and technology seminar, held in October 2007 in San Francisco, California, featured a robot from Fucking Machines called "Fuckzilla" in a live performance with one of the expo attendees. Kink.com signed a deal in 2007 with Pulse Distribution to sell material from Fucking Machines and its other sites to consumers in a DVD format. The first DVD distributed by the site in 2008 was titled Fucking Machines Volume 1 and featured 211 minutes of material with performers Aliana Love, Michah Moore, Lexi Love, and Sasha Grey.
By 2009 the website included 50 devices in its films. A 2009 article in SF Weekly was critical of the California state government for directing tax revenue towards classes on film production which were attended by Fucking Machines video editors. This article, in turn, was criticized by TheSword.com and characterized as "prudishness" by SFist and the San Francisco Bay Guardian.
The website asserts to its visitors that all performers engaged in sexual activities depicted in the videos appear of their own volition and feel bliss and gratification from the experience. The majority of new entrants to the adult film industry enjoyed their work with Fucking Machines because they discovered it was more socially acceptable to perform with a sexual device, rather than a human partner. Public relations manager for Kink.com Thomas Roche observed in a 2009 interview that Fucking Machines did not have a focus on BDSM material. In September 2010 the site had a live filming with an audience of 40 spectators, followed by the introduction in November 2010 of an interactive format in which viewers could watch shoots and recommend devices for the participants. By 2012 the site had 500 hours of archival footage with adult film performers, including Alexis Texas, Flower Tucci, and Sasha Grey. As of January 1, 2020 the site has stopped posting new videos.
Trademark appeal
Fucking Machines filed a request in July 2005 to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to secure its intellectual property rights for the mark "fuckingmachines", having met the first standard that the word was not in use by any other entity. The site became involved in a trademark dispute when the USPTO refused to grant a trademark for the name of the site, asserting that it was obscene. The case for Fucking Machines' use of the mark was handled by free speech attorney Marc Randazza.
The decision of the U.S. government was determined by lawyer Michael Engel, who ruled: "Registration is refused because the proposed mark consists of or comprises immoral or scandalous matter. The term 'fucking' is an offensive and vulgar reference to the act of sex. ... A mark that is deemed scandalous ... is not registrable." The USPTO based its rejection on a 1905 statute. It had previously refused the applications of 39 marks for using the word "fuck" and five marks for using the word "fucking". Requests to trademark terms including "shit" had been turned down by the USPTO 50 times, and a mark using "cunt" was rejected. Trademarks including the word "ass" had been accepted 135 times, and the word "bitch" was approved in several trademarks as well.
In response to the USPTO decision in the case, Randazza stated, "The trademark office has gone off the deep end with 2(a) rejections." Section 2(a), 15 USC §1052(a) disallows requests for marks that have "immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter".
Cybernet Entertainment, LLC, filed an "amendment and response to office action" of the USPTO decision in August 2006. Randazza introduced their brief with: "The Applicant respectfully challenges this characterization of the word 'fucking' and its allegedly 'offensive and vulgar' root: 'fuck'." Orlando Weekly commented on Randazza's brief in the case: "Randazza ... is frequently involved in free-speech cases – is fighting the federal government for your right to trademark any dirty word you please. And their filing in the case is one of the most entertaining legal documents you're likely to come across." Randazza's argument in the case came to be known as The Fuck Brief.
Randazza argued:
Randazza explained to Orlando Weekly that they used the word "fuck" routinely throughout their brief as part of their argument that the term is used in a variety of ways. They cited related terms, including "fuck-me boots", and frequent use of the word "fuck" in films including Wedding Crashers, Casino, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
The reply by Engel for the USPTO acknowledged the routine use of the word, and simultaneously asserted its scandalous nature: "Although the word is frequently used, it still is considered shocking in most formal or polite situations. For example, the word is bleeped out on basic cable, and broadcasters can be fined by the FCC for letting the word go out on the airwaves." They argued that the word was restricted in the workplace and by government regulations.
Randazza filed an appeal on June 5, 2007, and the matter was scheduled for a hearing before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Acworth told Orlando Weekly they considered ceasing appeals when the mark had initially been rejected by the USPTO. They said they were not intending to be the adult industry's representative for First Amendment rights. Acworth stated to Orlando Weekly, "Marc talked me into it. I'm not normally this sort of person. Marc thought they had a pretty good shot at it. I'm really going on their advice. ... I have no real agenda with it."
Adult entertainment attorney Robert Apgood stated they agreed with the actions of Acworth and Randazza. Apgood pointed out they had observed a significant increase in applications to the USPTO that were rejected because their potential trademarks were deemed "scandalous" by the government. They stated, "It's really quite unfortunate that the executive branch is now reaching deep into the machinations of government to further its 'legislation of morality' agenda. It is truly encouraging to see the likes of Acworth and Randazza take up this sorely needed fight." The appeal was denied in April 2008 and the case was terminated. The application status was last listed as "abandoned" for failure to respond by the appealing party.
Analysis
Advice columnist Dan Savage recommended the site in 2004 for readers interested in learning more about sex-machines. In the 2005 book edited by Carly Milne Naked Ambition, writer Regina Lynn commented on the site's emphasis on communication. Author Timothy Archibald consulted the operators behind Fucking Machines for research on their book Sex Machines: Photographs and Interviews.
Annalee Newitz of AlterNet visited the set of Fucking Machines in 2006 and classed the production as part of the phenomenon of Porn 2.0. Author Violet Blue wrote in their 2006 book The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Sex Toys, "Fucking Machines put machine sex on the map and into the popular consciousness, paving the way for a few individual companies to mass produce somewhat affordable sex-machines that couples and individuals can purchase and use at home."
In their 2007 book Naked on the Internet, author Audacia Ray wrote of the fucking machines: "In the fusion of female sexuality and technology, the curious and enthralling thing about these toys is the way in which they cast sexuality and technology together in a near miasma of technophobia and technofetishism." Jon Mooallem of The New York Times Magazine described the website as "dedicated entirely to women having sex with large and distressingly elaborate machines." In an article for Wired News, Regina Lynn noted that the presence of Fucking Machines at the 2007 AVN Adult Entertainment Expo was a move to the mainstream for the website: "The website has been around for years, in that grey area of 'indie internet kink' the Industry doesn't quite understand. Yet this year it is smack dab in the middle of the mainstream porn."
Bonnie Ruberg of The Village Voice wrote in a 2008 article that Fucking Machines replaces the insecurity men feel about vibrators and transform it into a turn-on. The 2008 edition of The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History described the aesthetic of the devices on the site as harrowing. In their 2009 book From Aches to Ecstasy, author Arnold P. Abbott commented of the devices used by the site: "Fucking Machines are mechanical marvels which had to be invented by the Marquis De Sade himself." They observed that some of the machines, "would seem to be replicas to those used during the Inquisition to extract false confessions".
In a 2012 article for The New York Observer, journalist Jessica Roy characterized Fucking Machines' examples of orgasms as a form of transhumanism. In the book Screening the Dark Side of Love: From Euro-Horror to American Cinema (2012), Sarah Schaschek devoted a chapter to the phenomenon, titled "Fucking Machines: High-Tech Bodies in Pornography". Schaschek concluded,
While antipornography feminists usually criticize that female performers are visually and practically degraded by men in heterosexual pornography, it is hard to uphold such an impression in the FuckingMachines videos. Given that all pornography eroticizes difference, and given that sexual fantasies usually require clearly drawn roles of dominance and submission, the women of FuckingMachines seem to resist at least a few of these categories. ... Strictly speaking, the women in these videos are both the controllers and the controlled.

The Fender Nashville B-Bender Telecaster is an American Standard series electric guitar made by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. This guitar is a Fender Telecaster with the addition of a factory-installed B-string bender device. The device raises the pitch of the second (B) string by one whole step (two frets) to C-sharp. The bend is activated by a one-inch downward pull on the guitar neck, allowing the player to emulate pedal steel sounds and play complex country bends. The Nashville B-Bender Telecaster was introduced in 1996 with major design changes in 1998 and 2000.
Origin
The B-Bender device was invented in 1967 by drummer and machinist Gene Parsons and guitarist Clarence White to fit White's Fender Telecaster. The B-string terminates in a separate hole beyond the normal bridge, this is connected to the upper strap button by a sprung lever behind a large plate on the back of the guitar. Pulling the neck downwards loads the lever and increases the tension on the string.
The original Parsons/White Stringbender was licensed to Leo Fender in 1968, but they never put it into production. Parsons continued to build and install the device himself, and sold several hundred to the Japanese instrument company Tokai Gakki for installation in their guitars. In the late 1980s, Parsons and business partner Meridian Green approached Fender again and met with luthier Fred Stuart at the new California Fender Custom Shop. Stuart and the Custom Shop eventually produced about 200 Clarence White model Telecasters equipped with the Parsons/White Stringbender, plus Scruggs tuners on both E strings. Based on this success, Fender decided to mass-produce a similar model. Parsons and Green redesigned the B-bender device for simpler installation and licensed it to Fender as the Parsons/Green B-Bender. The first Fender Nashville B-Bender Telecaster was manufactured in 1996.
1996 American Standard model
The first production model was called the American Standard B-Bender Telecaster. This guitar included two American Standard pickups and a 3-way selector switch. The guitar body was solid alder wood with a 1952-style sharp radius, a 1-piece maple neck and maple fretboard with rolled edges, 25.5 inch (648 mm) scale with 22 medium-jumbo frets, die-cast tuners and a 3-ply pickguard. The bridge was an American Telecaster series through-the-body model with 6 individually adjustable stainless steel saddles. The Parsons/Green B-Bender device was factory-installed in the routed-out back of the guitar and covered by a chrome plate. This model was available finished in Candy Apple Red, Black, Vintage White or Brown Sunburst, and was made in the United States.
1998 Hot Rodded American model
In the fall of 1998, the two-pickup system was replaced by a three-pickup configuration similar to the Stratocaster layout. The neck and bridge pickups were replaced with the hotter Delta Tone pickup system and the new middle pickup was the same "Texas Special" overwound single-coil pickup used in the Stevie Ray Vaughan model Stratocaster. The third pickup required a new selector switch, so a 5-way "Strat-o-Tele" selector with an S-1 switching system was added. All other features remained the same as the 1996 model.
2000 American Nashville model
Introduced in June 2000, the redesigned American Series model added Schaller staggered tuning machines, a new neck shape with rolled edges and a 4-ply white pearloid pickguard. The body was changed from alder to poplar, and the finishes were limited to Black and 3-color Sunburst. The S switching feature was also removed from this model. Other features remained the same as the 1998 Hot Rodded model. Fender has since stopped making the American Nashville series although a limited number can still be found for purchase.
Deluxe Nashville
The American made B-Bender should not be confused with the Deluxe Nashville, a guitar that Fender builds in its Mexico facility that a similar 3 pickup design to the B-Bender guitar, but has no B-Bender and features Vintage Noiseless pickups, a modern bridge with block saddles, 12"-radius maple neck with 22 medium-jumbo frets and pearloid dot inlays, contoured neck heel and locking tuners with short posts as of 2016.

Caspar Othmayr (12 March 1515 – 4 February 1553) was a German Lutheran pastor and composer.
Othmayr was born in Amberg, Upper Palatinate, and studied in Heidelberg as a pupil of Lorenz Lemlin, among others. Later, they became rector of the monastery school of Heilsbronn near Ansbach. From 1548 on they were provost in Ansbach, but soon lost the position because of theological differences.
Othmayr is considered one of the masters of melodic phrasing (Liedsatz) of the middle of the 16th century. The most important works were written from 1545 to 1550. They composed numerous hymns inspired by Martin Luther, and in 1546 wrote Epitaphium a Lutheri in memory of him.
Their works are found in numerous collections of their time, as in Georg Forster's Frische teutsche Liedlein.
Othmayr died in Nuremberg in 1553 at the age of 38.

The Margraviate of the Nordgau () or Bavarian Nordgau () was a medieval administrative unit (Gau) on the frontier of the German Duchy of Bavaria. It comprised the region north of the Danube and Regensburg (Ratisbon), roughly covered by the modern Upper Palatinate stretching up to the river Main and, especially after 1061, into the Egerland on the border with Bohemia.
History
The area east of Franconia proper up to the Bohemian Forest had been settled by Germanic Varisci and Armalausi tribes in ancient times; after the Migration Period, the forces of the proto-Merovingian king Chlodio (died 450) occupied the district. From the mid-6th century onwards, the region was Christianised by several wandering bishops, among them Saints Boniface (lived 675 to 754) and Emmeram of Regensburg. In 739, the Diocese of Regensburg was founded. At the insistence of Saint Boniface, Charles Martel (lived 688 to 741) built the great fortress of Wogastisburg.
When King Charlemagne deposed Duke Tassilo III of Bavaria in 788, they entered the Nordgau and brought the Carolingian Empire into contact with Bohemia permanently. For this reason, the incorporated Nordgau has been called the Bohemian March on occasion, although this term also designates the later Margraviate of Moravia. By an 806 deed issued at Thionville, Charlemagne separated out the Bavarian lands on the left bank of the Danube, including the ducal residences of Regensburg and Lauterhofen, called . Their chancellor Einhard submitted the deed to Pope Leo III for confirmation.
The Nordgau was again separated from Bavaria following the death of the Luitpolding duke Arnulf in 937. There has been some confusion over whether or not the Nordgau was separated from Bavaria at this date or only as late as 976, when the East Franconian count Berthold of Schweinfurt, who had helped to suppress the rebellion of the Bavarian duke Henry the Wrangler against Emperor Otto II, was appointed margrave to administrate the region as a distinct march.
Likewise, Berthold's son Count Henry of Schweinfurt appeared as Margrave of the Nordgau in 994. They backed the election of Duke Henry IV of Bavaria as King of the Romans in 1002, however, the new king (Henry II) responded with ingratitude. Count Henry soon after joined a revolt (the of 1003) in association with the German–Polish War (1002–1018) against the Polish ruler Bolesław I the Brave, after which they were deposed and arrested. In 1004, King Henry II installed their brother-in-law, Count Henry of Luxembourg, as Bavarian duke and gave the temporal authority of the Nordgau region over to the Bishopric of Bamberg, which they heavily favoured throughout their career. However, the margravial title survived in a succession of families in the region. Count Henry's possessions were partly restored and their descendants used the title "Margrave of Schweinfurt".
Throughout the 11th and 12th centuries, the Nordgau functioned as a pathway for invading armies from Bohemia and Hungary and for the countering armies of the Holy Roman Empire.
In the mid-11th century, the Salian emperor Henry III had an Imperial castle erected at Cham to encounter the forces of Duke Bretislav I of Bohemia. It became the residence of the Rapotonen noble family, who eventually received the margravial title by royal grant about 1073, passing it down as "Margrave of Vohburg" to their descendants.
Margrave Diepold III (d. 1146) was a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry V and founder of the abbeys in Reichenbach and Waldsassen. From about 1125, they had the fortress of Eger (Cheb) erected at the border with Bohemia. Their daughter Adelaide married the Swabian duke and later emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1147.
The Egerland was incorporated as a Hohenstaufen imperial territory upon Diepold's death and the town of Eger itself was inherited by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1167. It attained the immediate status of an Imperial city, while the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach controlled large parts of the Nordgau from the mid-13th century onwards. In 1322, the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV gave the Egerland in pawn to the Kingdom of Bohemia. By the 1329 Treaty of Pavia, they ceded the remaining Nordgau region to their Palatinate nephews Rudolf II and Rupert I, whereafter it became known as the "Upper Palatinate" ().

Gervais Ndirakobuca (born 1970) is a Burundian former rebel commander and police commissioner serving as the Prime Minister of Burundi since 7 September 2022. Prior to that, they were the Minister of Interior, Public Security, and Community Development.  They are known for their violent crackdown of the 2015 civil protest in Burundi and was under the United States and European Union sanctions for human rights violations when President Évariste Ndayishimiye appointed them security minister.
Biography
Gervais Ndirakobuca was born in 1970 in Bukinanyana in the Cibitoke Province of Burundi.
They were a rebel commander during the Burundian Civil War that ended in 2005. Their nickname was "Ndakugarika" meaning 'I will kill you' in the Kirundi language. After the civil war ended, they joined the National Police of Burundi and rose to the rank of Commissioner (lieutenant-general). They were addressed as General.
As police commissioner, they deployed excessive force to quell the 2015 civil protests that followed the amendment of the constitution which gave President Pierre Nkurunziza the legal right to run for a third term. Sanctions were imposed on Ndirakobuca by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and the European Union for "acts of violence, acts of repression and violations of international human rights law against protesters … on 26, 27 and 28 April in the Nyakabiga and Musaga districts in Bujumbura". At least 1,700 people were killed during the protest. International Criminal Court opened an investigation against government officials involved in the crackdown including Ndirakobuca.
Despite this, Ndayishimiye appointed them to a powerful position of Minister of Interior in June 2020, making Ndirakobuca the most internationally sanctioned member of Burundi national government cabinet. They were seen as a de facto deputy prime minister or 'supper minister' with their overwhelming portfolio across three key ministries of Interior, Security, and Community Development in the Nkurunziza's government, but was merged into a single ministry by Ndayishimiye and given to Ndirakobuca.
Ndirakobuca became prime minister of Burundi on 7 September 2022, replacing incumbent Prime Minister Alain-Guillaume Bunyoni, after Ndayishimiye warned that a coup d'état was being planned against their government. Ndirakobuca was unanimously voted to the position by the parliament.

USKOK (, ) is a body of the Croatian criminal justice system. USKOK is attached to the State's Attorney Office and specializes in investigations related to corruption and organized crime.
USKOK was formed in December 2001 and its headquarters are located in Zagreb. The bureau's name is a bacronym from "uskok", a term used for a type of Croatian militia men, who had fought against the Ottoman Empire between the early 16th and 17th century.
In December 2008 the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Act were revised to strengthen USKOK. The revisions increased the tools available to authorities to fight corruption, specifically the possibility for seizing and forfeiting assets. The revisions subsequently led both to a rise in the number of high level corruption prosecutions and the speed at which they are processed and completed.
Since 2009, USKOK has a counterpart in the Criminal Police Directorate (governing the Croatian Police) which has an (intentionally) very similar name - the National Police USKOK (), as well as in the judiciary - the Court Departments for Criminal Cases in the Jurisdiction of USKOK (). Described as "one of the world's most formidable anti-corruption outfits", the agency has prosecuted 2,000 individuals and achieved a 95% conviction rate (2012), including former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader.
In its 2014 EU Anti-Corruption report, the European Commission commended USKOK's ability to "carry out impartial investigations into allegations of corruption irrespective of the political affiliation or connections of those involved". But in a subsequent report in 2017, the EC noted enduring problems concerning inter-institutional coordination, and called the overall effectiveness of the institutional framework into question.

Lagunillas () is a rural town in the municipality of San Martín de Hidalgo in the Mexican state of Jalisco. The town is enclaved in the local and statewide touristic area Sierra de Quila, one of Jalisco's largest protected forests.
Lagunillas is known region-wide as an enchanting place with red-colored dirt roads and adobe houses with wooden accents contrasting a solid dark green forest and the silhouette of the Cerro El Huehuentón.
Toponymics
Lagunillas (lah-gun-nee-yahs) in Spanish means "small lakes". The word is a combination of the noun laguna, meaning "lake", and the suffix illa which means "small".
History
Lagunillas was probably founded by a group of settlers who, when searching for farmland, found small freshwater lakes. The town is atop a mesa surrounded by forests of oak and pine trees. The town is still surrounded by the Sierra de Quila, whose beauty symbolizes untouched nature. The population of Lagunillas has had a steady decline due to its rural location, it is currently 106 as of 2010.
Economy
During the peach harvest in Lagunillas, many residents from adjacent towns come to pick peaches for no cost, due to the hospitality of Lagunillas' residents. Maize and agave are farmed, but not in a significant quantity. Orchards of peaches and cherries are the town's agricultural symbol.

Before My Heart Falls () is a Canadian drama film, directed by Sébastien Rose and released in 2012. The film centres on Sarah (Clémence Dufresne-Deslières), a young con artist who regularly fakes a crisis on the side of the road so that they can rob men who stop to help her; however, after one of their cons results in a man's accidental death, they befriend the man's grieving widow Françoise (Sophie Lorain) while simultaneously trying to maintain their relationship with their crime boss Ji-Guy (Sébastien Ricard).
The film premiered on September 14, 2012 at the Quebec City Film Festival, before opening commercially on November 12.
Brendan Kelly of the Montreal Gazette gave the film a mixed review, praising Dufresne-Deslières's performance as a "force of nature" but concluding that the film ultimately "just doesn't have the emotional punch it should have".
The film received two Prix Jutra nominations at the 15th Jutra Awards in 2013, for Best Supporting Actor (Ricard) and Best Supporting Actress (Lorain).
The film was broadcast by Ici Radio-Canada Télé in 2019.

In 1951 Billboard magazine published three charts covering the best-performing country music songs in the United States: Most-Played Juke Box (Country & Western) Records, Best-Selling Retail Folk (Country & Western) Records and Country & Western Records Most Played By Folk Disk Jockeys. The juke box chart was compiled based on a "weekly survey among a selected group of jukebox operators whose locations require country and western records", the best sellers chart based on a "survey among a selected group of retail stores, the majority of whose customers purchase country and western records", and the jockeys chart based on a "weekly survey among a select list of over 400 disk jockeys specializing in country and western tunes". The juke box chart would be discontinued in 1957 and the other two charts merged in 1958 to form a multimetric chart, which has been published weekly since that date and since 2005 has been entitled Hot Country Songs.
In the first issue of Billboard of 1951, each chart had a different number one, although two were by the same artist. Lefty Frizzell was atop both the juke box and jockeys charts, with "If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time" and "I Love You a Thousand Ways" respectively, while the best sellers chart was headed by Hank Snow with "The Golden Rocket". During the year, each of the three charts had a song spend more than ten consecutive weeks at number one: Frizzell had an unbroken run of eleven weeks in the top spot of the best sellers chart with "Always Late (with Your Kisses)" and had a similar run at number one on the jockeys chart with "I Want to Be with You Always". The longest run at number one on any of the charts, however, was the fourteen consecutive weeks which Tennessee Ernie spent atop the juke box chart with "Shotgun Boogie". Frizzell reached number one for the first time in late 1950 and achieved five chart-toppers within 18 months, but soon afterwards their chart performance began to decline, their career suffering in part due to issues in their personal life. They were the only artist with four number-one country songs in 1951; Snow and Eddy Arnold each had three. Hank Williams had two number ones on the jockeys chart, but none on either of the other two charts.
Two artists reached number one for the first time in 1951. Carl Smith spent a single week in December atop the jockeys chart with their first number one, "Let Old Mother Nature Have Them Way", although the song would return to the top spot, and also top the best sellers and juke box charts, in 1952. Smith, who had only entered the chart for the first time earlier in the year, would go on to reach the top 40 nearly 70 times over a 20-year career before they chose to retire from the music industry. Bandleader Pee Wee King's debut chart-topper "Slow Poke", featuring their band the Golden West Cowboys and lead vocalist Redd Stewart, had lengthy runs in the top spot on all three charts in 1951, and ended the year in the number one position on all the listings. It would, however, prove to be the only number one single for King, whose career went into decline in the mid-1950s. Every artist to top the chart in 1951 has been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, beginning with Hank Williams, who was inducted posthumously in the first group of entrants in 1961.

Jan Swart van Groningen (c. 1495 in Groningen – c. 1563 in Antwerp), was a Dutch Renaissance painter.
Biography
According to Karel van Mander they were in Gouda in 1522–1523, at the same time that Jan van Scorel was there, who had just returned from Italy. They could paint landscape and flesh tones in the manner of Scorel, and travelled to Italy himself, spending time in Venice. Van Mander goes on to mention their woodcuts of Turks on horses armed with bow and arrow, as well as a woodcut of Christ preaching a sermon with a crowd of listeners on board a ship. Adriaen Pietersz. Crabeth was their disciple who later surpassed them quite quickly in their art. This young Crabeth was the son of "Cripple Pieter" (Krepel Pieter).
According to the RKD they were the teacher of Adriaen Pietersz Crabeth in Gouda c. 1535, after which period they moved to Antwerp.

Arthur Brian Deane Faulkner, Baron Faulkner of Downpatrick, (18 February 1921 – 3 March 1977), was the sixth and last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, from March 1971 until their resignation in March 1972. They were also the chief executive of the short-lived Northern Ireland Executive during the first half of 1974.
Faulkner was also the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) from 1971 to 1974.
Early life
Faulkner was born in Helen's Bay, County Down, the elder of two sons of James and Nora Faulkner. Their younger brother was Colonel Sir Dennis Faulkner, CBE VRD UD DL. James Faulkner owned the Belfast Collar Company which traded under the name Faulat. At that time, Faulat was the largest single purpose shirt manufacturer in the world, employing some 3,000 people. They were educated initially at Elm Park preparatory school, Killylea, County Armagh, but at 14 was sent to the Church of Ireland-affiliated St Columba's College at Rathfarnham in Dublin, although Faulkner was Presbyterian. Faulkner chose St Columba's, preferring to stay in Ireland rather than go to school in England. Their best friend at the school was Michael Yeats, son of W. B. Yeats. They were the only Prime Minister of Northern Ireland to have been educated in the Irish Free State and one of only two to have been educated in Ireland.
Faulkner entered the Queen's University of Belfast in 1939 to study law, but, with the advent of World War II, they quit their studies to work full-time in the family shirt-making business.
Early political career
Faulkner became involved in unionist politics, the first of their family to do so, and was elected to the Parliament of Northern Ireland as the Ulster Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of East Down in 1949. Their vociferous traditional unionist approach to politics ensured them a prominent backbench position. They are, at the time, the youngest ever MP in the Northern Irish Parliament. They were also the first Chairman of the Ulster Young Unionist Council in 1949.
In 1956 Faulkner was offered and accepted the job of Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, or Government Chief Whip.
Ministerial office
In 1959, they became Minister of Home Affairs and their handling of security for most of the Irish Republican Army's Border Campaign of 1956–62 bolstered their reputation in the eyes of the right wing of Ulster unionism.
When Terence O'Neill became Prime Minister in 1963 they appointed Faulkner, their chief rival for the job, as Minister of Commerce. Faulkner resigned in 1969 over the technicalities of how and when to bring in the local government reforms which the British Labour government was pushing for. This was a factor in the resignation of Terence O'Neill, who resigned as Prime Minister in the aftermath of their failure to achieve a good enough result in the 1969 Northern Ireland general election.
In the ensuing leadership contest, Faulkner lost out again when O'Neill gave their casting vote to their cousin, James Chichester-Clark. In 1970, Faulkner became the Father of the House.
Faulkner came back into government as Minister of Development under Chichester-Clark and in a sharp turn-around, began the implementation of the political reforms that were the main cause of their resignation from O'Neill's cabinet.
Chichester-Clark themselves resigned in 1971; the political and security situation and the more intensive British interest proving difficult.
Prime Minister
Promising beginnings
Faulkner was elected leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and Prime Minister. In their initial innovative approach to government, they gave a non-unionist, David Bleakley, a former Northern Ireland Labour Party MP, a position in their cabinet as Minister for Community Relations. In June 1971, they proposed three new powerful committees at Stormont which would give the opposition salaried chairpersonships of two of them.
Initial troubles
However, this initiative (radical at the time) was overtaken by events. The shooting of two Catholic youths in Derry by British soldiers prompted the SDLP, the largest Nationalist party and main opposition to boycott the Stormont parliament. The political climate deteriorated further when, in response to the worsening security situation, Faulkner introduced internment on 9 August 1971. This was a disaster; instead of lessening the violence, it caused the situation to worsen.
Despite this, Faulkner continued their radical approach to Northern Irish politics and, following Bleakley's resignation in September 1971 over the internment issue, appointed Dr G. B. Newe, a prominent lay Catholic, as Minister of State in the Cabinet Office. Faulkner's administration staggered on through the rest of 1971, insisting that security was the paramount issue.
In January 1972, an incident occurred during a Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march in Derry, during which paratroopers shot and killed thirteen unarmed civilians. A fourteenth civilian was to die later. What history has come to know as Bloody Sunday was, in essence, the end of Faulkner's government. In March 1972, Faulkner refused to maintain a government without security powers which the British government under Edward Heath decided to take back. The Stormont parliament was subsequently prorogued (initially for a period of one year) and following the appointment of a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, William Whitelaw, direct rule was introduced.
Chief Executive
In June 1973, elections were held to a new devolved parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections split the UUP. Faulkner became chief executive in a power-sharing executive with the SDLP and the centre-ground Alliance Party, a political alliance cemented at the Sunningdale Conference that year. However, the prominence in the Sunningdale Agreement of the cross-border Council of Ireland suggested that Faulkner had strayed too far ahead of their party. A section of the party had previously broken away to form the Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party, which contested the elections in opposition to the UUP.
The power-sharing Executive which they led lasted only six months and was brought down by a loyalist Ulster Workers Council Strike in May 1974. Loyalist paramilitary organisations were prominent in intimidating utility workers and blockading roads. The strike had the tacit support of many unionists. In 1974, Faulkner lost the leadership of the UUP to anti-Sunningdale elements led by Harry West. They subsequently resigned from the Ulster Unionist Party and formed the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland.
The UPNI fared badly in the Convention elections of 1975, winning only five out of the 78 seats contested. Whereas Faulkner had topped the poll in South Down in 1973 with over 16,000 votes, they polled just 6,035 votes in 1975 and finished seventh, winning the final seat. In 1976 Faulkner announced that they were quitting active politics. They were elevated to the House of Lords in the New Year's Honours list of 1977, being created Baron Faulkner of Downpatrick, of Downpatrick in the County of Down on 7 February 1977.
Personal life
Faulkner married Lucy Forsythe, a graduate of Trinity College Dublin, in 1951. They met through their common interests in politics and hunting. They were equally suited to a political partnership having had a career in journalism with the Belfast Telegraph and was secretary to the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, Sir Basil Brooke, when they met. Together they had three children: a daughter and two sons. They took up residence at Highlands, not far from the village of Seaforde. One of their sons, Michael, has written a memoir, "The Blue Cabin" (2006) about their move to the family's former holiday house on the island of Islandmore on Strangford Lough.
Brian Faulkner was a member of the Apprentice Boys of Derry but was expelled from the group in 1971.
Faulkner considered themselves to be both Irish and British writing "the Northern Ireland citizen is Irish and British; it is a question of complement, not of conflict" and reacted to the Republic of Ireland Act by remarking "They have no right to the title Ireland, a name of which we are just as proud as they".
Death
Lord Faulkner, a keen huntsman, died on 3 March 1977 at the age of 56 following a riding accident whilst hunting with the County Down Staghounds at the Ballyagherty/Station Road junction near Saintfield, County Down. Faulkner had been riding at full gallop along a narrow country road when their horse slipped. Faulkner was thrown off and killed instantly. They were laid to rest at Magherahamlet Presbyterian Church near Spa in County Down where they had been a regular member of the congregation. Lord Faulkner had retired from active politics and was pursuing their interests in industry at the time of their death. They had recently become a European consultant for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, a company which they proved instrumental in attracting to Northern Ireland during their tenure as Minister of Commerce. Their twenty-four-day life peerage was thus the shortest-lived until the death of Lord Heywood of Whitehall in 2018 just nine days after ennoblement, although there have been hereditary peerages, such as that of Lord Leighton, which have been shorter still.

Car Bomb (stylized as [Car_Bomb]) is an American mathcore band from Long Island, New York, United States, that was initially formed in 2000. Their debut album, Centralia, was released through Relapse Records on February 6, 2007. Car Bomb's style inspired later mathcore bands.
Biography
Car Bomb first came to be around the year 2000, when Bushwick residents Greg Kubacki and Michael Dafferner of the band Neck shared a rehearsal space under a Rockville Center, New York butcher with Elliot Hoffman and Jon Modell of the band Spooge. Over time, the bands became great friends and frequently visited each other's practices. In 2002, Modell, previously a touring bassist for Soilent Green, unsatisfied with the music their band was making, recruited Kubacki and Dafferner to form a side project called Car Bomb.
The band released a three track demo in 2004 which featured early versions of songs "Rid", "M^6" and "His Eyes". Car Bomb collaborated with a split 7-inch with Burnt by the Sun in 2007, featuring the track "Pieces of You". Their first full-length album Centralia was released on February 6, 2007, via Relapse Records. In 2011, the band was dropped from the Relapse Records label and their subsequent albums were independently released through Bandcamp. According to Doug Moore, writing for Invisible Oranges, "Each member [of the band] works a technologically-inclined professional day job, which restricts their schedules but offers them uncommon financial resources. Some bands build their own studios; Car Bomb built their own microphones from scratch." In addition to buying or making equipment to create their own studio, this means that the band does not depend on the resources of a record label to finance recordings and production costs.
Car Bomb showcased a number of new songs from w^w^^w^w on their May 2009 tour with Gojira and The Chariot, viewable on YouTube.
Singer Michael Dafferner premiered their first independently released film [Why_You_Do_This], a feature-length documentary about "money, touring, and technical metal", at the Queen's World Film Festival in August 2011. The band's New York rehearsal space was flooded in early 2012, with most of the equipment being lost or damaged.
The band released their second full-length album w^w^^w^w in 2012, featuring a guest vocal appearance from Joseph Duplantier of the band Gojira. w^w^^w^w is supposedly pronounced 'w click w', but guitarist Greg Kubacki mentioned "a lot of people are now calling it the 'waveform record,' which works too."
In September 2016, the band released a new track "From the Dust of This Planet" on Bandcamp from their forthcoming album Meta. Through October, the band previewed the tracks "Gratitude" and "Sets", and the video for "Black Blood". Meta was released on October 28, 2016. Duplantier had a guest vocal appearance for the second Car Bomb album in a row, and Frank Mullen from Suffocation joined the band in the studio for the first time.
The band accompanied the release with gigs starting with Gojira and the Dillinger Escape Plan in November 2016, and followed with a world tour including the US, Europe, and the UK supporting Gojira in early 2017.
The album Mordial was released on September 27, 2019. It was recorded at Silvercord Studios, written/produced by Greg Kubacki and mixed by Adam "Nolly" Getgood (Periphery, Devin Townsend, Animals as Leaders). The first single off the album, "Dissect Yourself", was released on May 30, 2019. Two other singles were released prior to the release of the full album: "Scattered Sprites" and "HeLa".
The band headlined their own European tour starting in September 2019, before returning to the US in October to support Periphery and Animals as Leaders.
Style
Car Bomb's style is marked by an experimental and extremely aggressive approach to metal. Describing a 2014 Car Bomb performance supporting Meshuggah, Amit Sharma of Kerrang! said of the band: "Long Island experimentalists Car Bomb sound absolutely ferocious. Their psychotic turbo-thrash is disgustingly disorientating, 'Frankensteining' Meshuggah and The Dillinger Escape Plan into one relentless onslaught of time-chopping violence."

Haydn Arthur Morley (26 November 1860 — 15 May 1953) was an English footballer who played in The Football League for Derby County and Notts County. Morley also played cricket for Derbyshire in the summer months.
In September 1888 Morley signed for Nottingham Forest, but, they did not stay there long. Within three months they were back at Notts County and making their Football League debut.
Morley played two League matches for Notts County and when they played their team scored two goals (out of 40) and conceded five out of 73 goals. The 40 goals was the joint third lowest tally by any League club that season. The 73 goals conceded was the worst by any League club in 1888–89. Notts County finished 11th and had to seek re-election.
As March 1889 arrived, Archibald Ferguson was unavailable so Morley switched back to left-back for the visit of Burnley. This was Morley's League debut for Derby County. The game was fiercely contested and both defences played well. Lewis Cooper got the crucial winning goal in the 70th minute to enable Derby County to win 1–0.
Morley kept their place for four League matches, even when in the fourth match at Stoke, when Archibald Ferguson returned to the team, Morley kept their left-back spot. However, they were left out, or injured, for the last game of the season at Blackburn Rovers. They played four League games for Derby County, all at left-back. They also played in both of Derby County' FA Cup ties, once at left-back and once at right-back, keeping one clean-sheet.
In 1890, Morley captained The Wednesday in the FA Cup Final. Wednesday lost the game to Blackburn Rovers 6-1.
Their granddaughter was actor Josephine Tewson.

Prabowo Subianto's presidential campaign in 2019 or Gerakan Nasional #2019GantiPresiden was their second presidential bid, following their loss to Joko Widodo (Jokowi) in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election. Their running mate was business person and former Jakarta deputy governor Sandiaga Uno.
Backed by a coalition of five political parties representing 40 percent of the seats in the People's Representative Council, Prabowo received their first official endorsement from their own party Gerindra in April 2018, with the other parties' support being secured in August 2018.
After quick counts and official counting indicated likely victory for Jokowi, Prabowo declared they would reject the results, insisting there had been excessive fraud.
Background
After being Megawati Soekarnoputri's running mate in the 2009 Indonesian presidential election, Prabowo Subianto made their first bid for the presidency in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election. They were defeated by Joko Widodo, who won 53.15% of the vote. Previously, during the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election which saw Jokowi be elected Governor of Jakarta, Prabowo had supported him.
Between 2014 and 2019, Prabowo remained second to Jokowi in most opinion polls. The opposition coalition was initially a majority, until several parties defected to the government side.
Team
Prabowo's campaign team was headed by former Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Djoko Santoso. The team also included former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (as a national campaigner), in addition to various opposition political figures such as Rachmawati Sukarnoputri and Ahmad Muzani.
The campaign team set up a national secretariat in Surakarta, just away from Jokowi's private residence there, in addition to a post away. Coordinators claimed the proximity of the bases was coincidental.
Timeline
Pre-registration
After initial uncertainties over whether Prabowo would run themselves or endorse another presidential candidate or even become Jokowi's running mate, Gerindra, which Prabowo co-founded and leads, officially endorsed their second presidential bid on 11 April 2018. Following electoral laws, Gerindra by itself did not have enough votes to endorse Prabowo and needed to form a coalition. The coalition ended up comprising Gerindra, the Democratic Party (Demokrat), the Islamist parties Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and National Mandate Party (PAN), along with first-time party Berkarya. The parties in total represent 40 percent of the seats in the People's Representative Council and 36 percent of the popular vote in the 2014 Indonesian legislative election.
Prior to the registration, Prabowo's coalition discussed the running mate, bringing up the possibility of selecting figures such as Anies Baswedan or following suggestions from coalition parties and Islamist groups, including Yudhoyono's son Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono or popular preacher Abdul Somad. Eventually, in what Uno themselves described as a "last-minute decision", Jakarta Vice Governor and Gerindra cadre Sandiaga Uno was appointed as Prabowo's running mate. According to a statement by a National Mandate Party politician, the coalition parties only agreed on Uno as Prabowo's running mate "half an hour" before the pair's formal declaration on 9 August. As part of the deal, Uno must renounce their membership in Gerindra, making them an independent.
Campaigning
After being verified, Prabowo-Uno was assigned the ballot number 2 on 21 September 2018. The pair's campaigned team split the two into separate regions for campaigning to maximize coverage - for example, on the first day of official campaigning at 23 September, Prabowo attended formal events in Jakarta while Uno visited multiple locations in Central Java. Uno stated that their campaigning will focus in Central Java - with 818 locations visited being officially recorded by KPU by early December 2018.
In response to multiple regional leaders publicly endorsing Jokowi's reelection, Prabowo's campaign team requested regional leaders who supported them to "stay calm" and focus on developing their respective regions. On 14 January 2019, Prabowo gave a national speech at the Jakarta Convention Center, titled "Indonesia Menang" ("Indonesia Wins"), where they called for a national reorientation of development and management.
On Sunday, 7 April 2019, Prabowo and Uno held an open rally, the largest during their campaigning period, in the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium. Democratic Party leader and former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (who is part of Prabowo's camp) criticized the rally for being "too exclusive" with Islamic activities dominating.
During the final candidate debate on 13 April 2019, Prabowo stated that Indonesian economic issues originated partly from Jokowi's predecessors. The statement was heavily attacked by members of the Democratic Party - who saw the statement as an attack to Yudhoyono.
Post-voting
Hours after the voting on 17 April 2019, Prabowo claimed victory in the election, citing internal exit polls despite most survey agencies releasing quick count results of the opposite. Later, they declared that real count results showed that they won with 62 percent of the votes.
Upon announcement of the official results on 21 May, Prabowo rejected it, and stated that they would bring the results to court.
Positions
During a campaign speech, Prabowo declared that they aimed to achieve food self-sufficiency and to minimize imports to strategic goods. Their campaign promises also included adding more items to the determination of the minimum wage in the country, limiting both outsourcing and foreign workers, removing land and property tax for utilized housing, and limiting the use of debt financing in the national budget to productive sectors. Another promise was to reduce income taxes and to lift the tax-free bracket higher, from the value of Rp4.5 million (US$300) a month in 2018. Prabowo also stated during the first debates that they aimed to increase the Indonesian tax ratio to 16 percent - compared to 12.1 percent in 2019.
Finances
By November 2018, Prabowo's campaign team had reported Rp41.9 billion in receipts (~US$3 million), mostly contributions from Prabowo and Uno, and expenditures of Rp34.5 billion (~US$2.4 million). During an interview, the campaign team leader Djoko Santoso remarked that the team had limited funding, and did not expect much external funding. In order to raise funds for the campaign, Uno sold their shares at their publicly-listed company Saratoga Investama - raising around Rp300 billion (~US$20 million) by October 2018.
Controversies
During their campaign, Prabowo was accused of spreading pessimism and exercising Donald Trump's 2016 campaign strategy of highlighting economic disparity. In a speech in October 2018, Prabowo said they want to "Make Indonesia Great Again", much like Trump's 2016 campaign slogan. The slogan was also used by one of their most prominent supporters, Fadli Zon, in 2017. Prabowo accused the media of "manipulating" attendance figures at the 212 "Mujahideen" Grand Reunion on 2 December 2018. Prabowo addressed the rally, at which participants shouted their name combined with the takbir.
In a campaign speech in Surabaya, Jokowi accused Prabowo's campaign team of disseminating hateful propaganda aided by foreign consultants, citing "Russian propaganda" and the "firehose of falsehood" model. Russia's ambassador to Indonesia, Lyudmila Vorobyeva, denied that Russia intervenes in the domestic affairs of other countries.
Prabowo has close relationships with fundamental Muslims, such as Muhammad Rizieq Shihab of the Islamic Defenders Front. Rizieq, who is in hiding in Mecca, persistently campaigned against Jokowi and for Prabowo. Prabowo also promised to bring Rizieq home should they elected. When asked about FPI's support, Prabowo's brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo said they accepted everyone who wants to support Prabowo as they wanted to win.

"Cause and Effect" is the 18th episode of the fifth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, the 118th overall. It was originally released on March 23, 1992, in broadcast syndication. It was written by Brannon Braga, who sought to write an unusual type of time travel related plot, and directed by cast member Jonathan Frakes.
Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise is caught in a time loop which results in the destruction of the ship and the loss of all hands after a collision with the USS Bozeman. As events re-occur, they begin to feel a sense of déjà vu and upon investigating, realize their predicament. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) realizes how to pass a brief message to themselves in the next loop, which allows them to save the ship from destruction.
Cheers actor Kelsey Grammer was offered the role of Captain Morgan Bateson and accepted. Due to scheduling conflicts, Kirstie Alley was unable to reprise their Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan role as Lt. Saavik. Plans for the USS Bozeman were changed due to the budget, which resulted in a modification to the USS Reliant model created for The Wrath of Khan and the use of the movie-era Enterprise bridge. "Cause and Effect" received Nielsen ratings of 13.0 percent, making it the sixth most watched episode of the season. Critics praised the episode, specifically Braga's writing, Frakes's direction, and the opening sequence in which the Enterprise is destroyed.
Plot
The Enterprise is caught in a time loop (referred to in-universe as a "temporal causality loop"). The loop begins with the senior members of the crew playing poker and continues for about a day when they discover a spatial anomaly. While studying the anomaly, a Federation ship suddenly emerges from it. Commander William T. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) suggests decompressing the main shuttlebay to move the Enterprise out of danger, while Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) advocates using a tractor beam to push the other ship out of the way. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) chooses Data's option, although the tactic does not succeed and the other ship strikes one of the Enterprise warp nacelles, causing a critical failure and the destruction of the Enterprise moments later, at which point the loop restarts.
Initially, crew members are unaware of the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before they go to bed following the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and being able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with them to their room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop just prior to the destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but do not know how to avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that their positronic brain can be used to send a short message to themselves in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.
On the following loop, Crusher again has a feeling of déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout other parts of the ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, that the tractor beam will not be successful, and that they should try Riker's method. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew establish they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.
Production
The script was written by Brannon Braga, who sought to write a time-travel related episode without using a "screwed up time-lines" type plot. Braga called it the most enjoyable episode they wrote that season, as they had never seen a time loop episode before but they did not know how to get the crew out of the loop, nor what the message was which would be passed to a future loop. They attributed the poker game, which was not in the original plan, to a sugar rush after eating pancakes. They felt that the destruction of the Enterprise was the best possible cold open for the episode, and they were pleased how they managed to tie the poker game into the overall plot. Braga named the USS Bozeman for their hometown of Bozeman, Montana, while the registration number of NCC-1941 was a reference to the comedy film 1941 (1979).
On the episode's 30th anniversary, Braga recalled that the actors had the same confused reaction as the audience would when they initially read the script. Many of them wondered if it was a joke. The idea had evolved from their desire to do an episode telling the same story from different perspectives, like the classic Akira Kurosawa film Rashomon. Braga changed their plan to the time loop when they could not find a way to make their original concept fit into an hourlong episode. Braga's greatest difficulties were how the episode would resolve, for which they turned to their fellow writers, and the scene in the briefing room where LaForge explains how the Enterprise has become trapped in a time loop. "It was my first big 'technobabble' scene, so it couldn't just sound cool. It had to sound plausible. It had to resolve all the clues that had been accumulating", they recalled. To make it distinctly his, they added some shocking lines, such as LaForge telling Picard that the ship may have been trapped in the loop for years. Showrunner Michael Piller had Braga rewrite that scene many times. "I remember over Christmas break of that year, I was working on [it]."
Cast member Jonathan Frakes directed the episode, having prepared for it while shooting the episode "The Outcast". They were not involved in the casting process, as they had offered the role of Captain Morgan Bateson to Kelsey Grammer, who had accepted. Grammer was a Star Trek fan, and in their role as Frasier Crane on Cheers, they filmed on the Paramount lot near where The Next Generation was produced. Frakes found it a challenge to film the same scenes with the same dialogue over and over but in a way which made them look different. Marvin V. Rush, the director of photography, worked with cameraman Waverly Smothers to develop an attachment for a camera using a bungee cord which allowed for a different style of shooting. Frakes also worked while at home, planning out shots in order to ensure that there was a variety to each loop. Executive producer Rick Berman had made it clear that Frakes could not re-use footage and each loop needed to be filmed fresh, in order to prevent the episode from looking like a clip show. To do so, Frakes used angles on familiar sets that had never been used, such as shooting the conference room from the ceiling and the bridge from where Riker and Ensign Ro sat. They also used Steven Spielberg's technique of using a slow zoom to indicate a character understanding their situation.
Several changes took place to the script because of filming and casting difficulties. The crew planned to make the USS Bozeman a Star Trek: The Original Series-era Constitution class ship, similar to the original USS Enterprise. However, no model was available to use and the costs of creating a new one, along with costumes and props, were prohibitive enough that the plan was scrapped. Instead, the USS Reliant model created for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was used. Greg Jein and Michael Okuda made the relevant changes, removing the rollbar and adding sensor arrays, resulting in it being described as a Soyuz class vessel. The bridge of the Bozeman was a re-dressed version of the film series Enterprise bridge. It was then intended to get Kirstie Alley, then a co-star of Grammer's on the sitcom Cheers, in a cameo role behind Grammer in the USS Bozeman shots, reprising their role as Lieutenant Saavik from the movie The Wrath of Khan, but could not do so due to scheduling difficulties. Rob Legato organized the large-scale miniature effects for the episode on set 10, with large-scale but low-detail versions of the Enterprise created along with just nacelle models for the Bozeman to collide with.
Originally the episode was to end with a montage of all the crashes between the two ships, but that scene was cut for budgetary reasons.
The German dub of this episode starts with a hint to the opening line of Neil Simon's play The Odd Couple. The first sentence of each new loop starts with Riker saying "On Vulcan they built a monument in memory of someone who shuffled themselves to death" which is a direct reference to the first line in the German translation of The Odd Couple "In Central Park they built a monument in memory of someone who shuffled themselves to death." This was because a german TV broadcast of the odd couple was broadcast the day before on the same network.
Reception
The episode aired during the week commencing March 23, 1992, in broadcast syndication. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received ratings of 13.0 percent. This means that it was watched by 13 percent of all households watching television during its timeslot. It was the sixth most watched episode of the season, behind both parts of "Unification", "A Matter of Time", "Power Play" and "The Game". Some viewers complained to the stations broadcasting it, believing that the repeating acts were the result of a technical problem.
James Van Hise in their book The Unauthorized Trek: The Complete Next Generation, said that the episode "fascinated" them due to the "experimental" nature. They praised the direction of Frakes, who saved it from being a series of "potentially boring repetition[s]", adding that they "clearly has a firm grasp on the series." Juliette Harrisson listed "Cause and Effect" as the seventh most groundbreaking episode of the series in 2012 for Den of Geek. Keith DeCandido gave the episode a rating of 9 out of 10 in a review for Tor.com, praising the means by which Frakes made each repetition different, and Braga's writing, which they described as a "tour de force". They said that "Cause and Effect" had "the best teaser in the history of Star Trek", adding, "This is an absolute triumph of craft from both Braga and Frakes, and just a fun episode, with the added bonus of Captain Frasier Crane at the end. I almost didn't need to rewatch this one, as it's one of my go-to episodes when I want to watch a Star Trek episode for the heck of it, and I have yet to tire of it."
Zack Handlen gave "Cause and Effect" a grade of "A" in their review for The A.V. Club. They called the opening sequence "strong", and said that one of the "tricks" of this episode was that it does not break its own rules in finding a resolution. They summarized, "Once again, TNG does what it does best: You take an ostensibly goofy idea, and then you make it sting by thinking through the consequences." In a list of the top 100 episodes of the Star Trek franchise, "Cause and Effect" was placed in 62nd place by Charlie Jane Anders at io9.
In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter said this was the 70th best episode of all Star Trek television, and possibly the best opening scene.
Viviane Casimir published an article in the Winter 1997 issue of the journal Extrapolation that used Data's ability to transmit a message to themselves as an example of assigning special mental abilities to a cyborg. In Computers of Star Trek, Lois Gresh and Robert Weinberg noted a contradiction between the description of Data being built around a neural net and examples of traditional von Neumann architecture. They noted how, in "Cause and Effect", when a crew member removed the cover to Data's positronic brain, it exposed flashing lights reminiscent of the large computers of the fifties and sixties, that reflected the values in the CPU's accumulator and other registers.
In 2017, Den of Geek listed "Cause and Effect" as one of the top ten ground-breaking episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation.
In 2018, CBR ranked this one of the top twenty time travel themed episodes of all Star Trek series.
In 2019, ThoughtCo ranked "Cause and Effect" in the top ten best episodes of the series, describing it as a "great story of time and choices". Also in 2019, The Hollywood Reporter ranked it among the top 25 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation who described it as having a unique repetitive structure and noting its direction by Jonathan Frakes. The Hollywood Reporter ranked "Cause and Effect" as the 19th best episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, noting the time-loop plot.
In 2019, The Hollywood Reporter listed this among the 25 best episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation.
In 2020, Screen Rant ranked this episode the 13th best of Star Trek: The Next Generation, noting "lot of tension in the episode" and that the Kelsey Grammer cameo was "treat". That same year, they conclude that it is, "One of the best TNG episodes ever written," however, they also point out it is a terrifying episode and one of the top most frightening episodes of the series. They find the destruction of the Enterprise at the start "shocking", and then the audience is taken on a repeating "roller coaster ride" of deja vu catastrophe.
Media releases
"Cause and Effect" was first released on VHS cassette in the United States and Canada on June 10, 1997. The episode was later released in the United States on November 5, 2002, as part of the season five DVD box set. A further DVD release came as part of The Best of Star Trek: The Next Generation – Volume 2 on November 17, 2009, in the United States.
The first Blu-ray release was in the United States on November 18, 2013, followed by the United Kingdom on November 19.

The Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895: Perceptions, Power, and Primacy is a 2003 non-fiction book by Sarah C. Paine about the first Sino-Japanese War.
Background
The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 is a follow up to Sarah Paine's previous work, Imperial Rivals: China, Russia and Their Disputed Frontier. The book makes use of contemporary newspapers alongside Chinese and Japanese secondary sources; Paine learned Japanese so that they could analyse these works.
Content
The book analyses the events leading up to, the causes of, and the resulting outcome of the first Sino-Japanese war. Paine argues that the war ended the previous balance of power in East Asia, leading to the decline of the Confucian Qing dynasty, and that it had a lasting impact on Western perceptions of East Asia.
The book consists of three sections, and an epilogue. The first section discusses the events leading up to the war, the second section looks at the war from a military perspective, and the third section examines the post-war negotiations and settlements.
Reception
The China Review International described Paine's arguments as "well-constructed, researched and argued", and recommended the book for "anyone with an interest in the events and region in which the Sino-Japanese war took place and especially for those with a professional interest in the topic." However, they noted that the book claims that the Guangxu Emperor died the day after Empress Dowager Cixi, which they suggested was inaccurate, as it is contrary to most accounts, who say that the emperor died one day before Cixi.
The International History Review called The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 "an important book that delights and informs", giving particular praise to the book for bringing attention to the Chinese concept of face (guanxi), something which previous authors had neglected, and went on to suggest that Paine "ends the shortage of books on this pivotal war". This was seconded by The Journal of Military History who praised Paine's "multi-faceted approach to true international history", saying that they had exhausted all of the English-language sources on the subject, and that "In responding to Marius B. Jansen's call for a thorough historical treatment of one of the yawning gaps in East Asian history, Paine's history of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 succeeds admirably."

The Cineston controller is a control lever used in mass transit vehicles that combines the accelerator, brake and emergency controls into a single hand-operated device. The Cineston controller allows smooth operation of the vehicle, avoids the application of brake and throttle at the same time, and provides a clear visual indication of the current power setting. However, it is only suitable for vehicles that do not require steering control, as it is hand operated and thus interferes with the presence of any sort of steering wheel.
The Cineston evolved from the rotary controllers used to control the power delivered to the electric traction motors in early mass transit systems. In early systems, notably those found in trams, the motor control was operated by the left hand, and the brakes by the right hand. Typically the brake lever also included a dead man's switch that released air pressure to activate the air brakes in an emergency. In the Cineston, motor control and brake controls are combined in a single lever's rotary motion, and the dead man's switch is implemented in a vertical motion.
The lever extends to the right from a vertical control shaft. The lever has a neutral position with the lever extended directly to the left of the pivot. Braking is applied by progressively rotating the lever counter-clockwise, which, due to the position of the level relative to the pivot, is actuated by the operator moving their hand away to the body - to the "front". Forward traction is added by rotating the lever clockwise, or "backward". As the lever translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the lever, the level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end. This allows the operator to slide the lever without twisting their wrist. The controller often also incorporates a fail-safe device (or dead man's switch) that requires constant downward pressure once the lever is rotated forward from the neutral position. Releasing the lever causes it to pop up on a spring, activating emergency braking.
The Cineston controller is known to have design flaws. If the operator suffers from a debilitating attack, they may fall forward onto the control, allowing their body weight to keep the dead-man's switch in its safe position. Additionally, because the lever typically moves forward for traction, in the event of a sudden stop the operator's inertia can cause the lever to be forced forward, increasing traction. This was mentioned as a possibility in the 1977 Chicago Loop derailment, where the operator continued accelerating after a minor collision for unknown reasons.
The Cineston's general operation is similar to the slide-controllers found in many modern mass transit systems. These controllers can be considered to be a re-implementation of the Cineston, as its fore-aft motion for acceleration and braking is the same. The change in layout is due to the introduction of new electronic controls, which do not require any mechanical connection between the operating lever and the electrical control systems.

Edwin Alexander Anderson Jr. (16 July 1860 – 23 September 1933) was a United States Navy officer who received the Medal of Honor for actions during the 1914 American intervention at Veracruz. They retired from the Navy in 1924, as an admiral.
Early life and career
Anderson was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. They were appointed a cadet midshipman to the United States Naval Academy from the 3rd Congressional District of North Carolina, on 28 June 1878, and graduated with the Class of 1882, receiving their ensign's stripe on 1 July 1884, after the customary two-year's sea duty.
Anderson advanced slowly up the promotion ladder, such advancements in those times being received on basis of seniority; they remained an ensign for ten years before becoming a lieutenant, junior grade. Detached from the cruiser , Anderson reported on board the cruiser on 28 January 1897, and was serving in that ship at the time of the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in the spring of 1898.
Spanish–American War
At that time, the United States Navy threw a blockade around Cuba. By early May 1898, Marblehead was operating off the south coast of Cuba, off the port of Cienfuegos—a cable terminus important to Spanish communications—in company with the converted yacht , the gunboat , the revenue cutter and the collier .
To sever this vital link, Captain Bowman H. McCalla, senior officer in the group, planned an operation to cut the cable at Cienfuegos, designating Lieutenant Cameron McRae Winslow as the commanding officer, with Lieutenant, (jg) Anderson as their second-in-command. Winslow accordingly gave Anderson command of the sailing launches from Marblehead.
After the guns of the two warships smashed Spanish positions ashore, the boats moved in to carry out the operation. Anderson's boat quickly snatched up the first cable and, assisted by Nashvilles boat, cut it. They soon grapneled a second cable and were in the process of cutting it, too, when the Spaniards opened a slow fire that soon grew to volley proportions, from rifles, automatic weapons and one-pounders. After a Spanish bullet felled the coxswain of Anderson's boat, Anderson took the helm and began steering the boat seaward, directing their men to keep down between the thwarts. The Spanish fire, however wounded three more men and holed the boat in many places. After the action, Anderson had nothing but praise for their sailors and marines, commending their intelligent and cheerful work in the exhausting labor of picking up and cutting the heavy cables, working even under heavy fire until ordered to stop. The operation proved successful in another aspect. The ships gunfire decimated a large Spanish force sent to the area to contest the operation.
Subsequently, Anderson delivered the prize steamer Adula to Savannah, Georgia, in July 1898, and was given command of another Spanish prize, the gunboat . Recommended for advancement in grade for their heroism at Cienfuegos in August 1898, this advancement (five numbers in grade) came finally on 11 February 1901.
Post-war advancement, Medal of Honor
Anderson commanded the gunboat from 13 April 1901 – 24 December 1903, in the Philippines, and, later, in Hong Kong. During the remainder of the 1900s, Anderson advanced to commander; among their tours of duty included a stint at the Navy Recruiting Station, Cincinnati, Ohio, and at the Mare Island Navy Yard as ordnance officer before being given command of the gunboat in the autumn of 1910. They briefly commanded the battleship during the assemblage the fleet in New York City before being detached for duty as Captain of the Yard at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.
Late in 1913, Anderson was given command of the battleship , and while in command of that ship, took part in the American intervention at Veracruz, Mexico, in April 1914. Given command of the Second Seaman Regiment, Anderson led that bluejacket landing force ashore and so distinguished themselves in the fighting that followed that they received the Medal of Honor.
Subsequently attending the Naval War College, Anderson served as Supervisor of Naval Auxiliary Reserves, Norfolk, and later than Commander, Squadron Three, Patrol Force, assigned defense duties out of Key West, Florida, during World War I, with as their flagship. They were promoted to rear admiral and took command of Squadron One, Patrol Force, Atlantic Fleet, for the duration of the First World War.
Flag assignments
Over the next few years, Anderson flew their flag as Commander Division 1, Cruiser Squadrons, Atlantic Fleet, and as Commandant, Sixth Naval district, headquartered at Charleston, South Carolina, before assuming command of United States Naval Forces in European Waters, with the rank of vice admiral. They were soon redesignated as Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, however from 28 August 1922.
Continued turmoil in China had occasioned the presence of substantial numbers of foreign warships in Chinese waters including the Asiatic Fleet. Anderson's ships carried out the usual kinds of peacetime operations ever ready to perform protective service for American nationals. During their tour, however the Fleet distinguished itself in quite an unexpected fashion.
A severe earthquake rocked Japan, causing heavy damage to such cities as Tokyo and Yokohama. As Secretary of the Navy Edwin C. Denby reported in 1923, "One of the brightest pages in the history of the Navy has recently been written by the Asiatic Fleet in its mission of mercy to the stricken people of Japan." Admiral Anderson promptly placed their fleet at the disposal of the Japanese, immediately dispatched a division of destroyer from Chinese waters to Yokohama with medical supplies to render assistance. The ships of Destroyer Division 38, led by the destroyer , were in fact the first ships to render assistance to the city of Yokohama. All available naval vessels were laden with clothing, food, medicines, and supplies, and rushed to Japanese waters. Admiral Anderson themselves arrived at Yokohama in their flagship the armored cruiser on the afternoon of September 1923.
Within two weeks' time, the United States Ambassador in Japan, Cyrus E. Woods, could cable:
I have been informed by the Foreign Office that food emergency has been met. Only problem remaining is question of distribution. This is the Japanese with their organizing ability and their ability to recover from shock desire to handle themselves. It will gratify the American people to know that the prompt action of Admiral Anderson has had much to do with this. American Navy's assistance thoroughly appreciated by the men in the street as well as the Japanese government. I wish to emphasize that in this critical emergency the first assistance from the outside world since the catastrophe was brought by our Asiatic Fleet.
Subsequently, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Masanao Hanihara, expressed gratitude for Admiral Anderson's "unflagging zeal and efficiency" that led to the "prompt and gallant assistance" that enabled the situation to be brought "well under control in a short time."
Retirement and death
Relieved by Admiral Thomas Washington on 11 October 1923, Anderson returned to the United States, and was placed on the retired list with the permanent rank of admiral on 23 March 1924.
Anderson died at their home in Masonboro Sound, Wilmington, North Carolina on 23 September 1933. They were buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

Khristinn Kellie Leitch FRCSC (born July 30, 1970) is a Canadian surgeon and former politician who served as the Member of Parliament for the riding of Simcoe—Grey from 2011 to 2019 as a member of the Conservative Party. They were first elected in the 2011 federal election, succeeding Member of Parliament Helena Guergis who was dismissed from the Conservative Party caucus. Following their election, Leitch was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. On July 15, 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper named Leitch Minister of Labour and Minister for the Status of Women. They served in Cabinet until the defeat of the Conservative government in the 2015 federal election. Leitch ran in the 2017 contest for the leadership of the Conservative Party. On January 23, 2018, Leitch announced that they would not be seeking re-election for the 43rd Canadian federal election and would return to being a full-time surgeon.
Training and medical career
Leitch was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and raised in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of Fort McMurray, Alberta.  They are the daughter of Eleanor Lynne (Conway) and Kelburne "Kit" McNabb Leitch, who owned a construction company in Fort McMurray. They were raised a Catholic, and still practises the religion.
They graduated from Queen's University in 1991 with an undergraduate degree. They earned their MD from the University of Toronto in 1994, MBA from Dalhousie University in 1998, and completed the Orthopaedic Surgery Residency Program in 2001 at the University of Toronto. They became a fellow of clinical paediatric orthopaedics at Children's Hospital Los Angeles/University of Southern California in 2002.
Leitch formerly taught at the University of Western Ontario, where they served as the assistant dean of external affairs at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, and is a former chair of paediatric surgery at the Children's Hospital of Western Ontario.
They were an orthopaedic pediatric surgeon at SickKids Hospital for one year before pursuing a career in politics. Leitch is also an associate professor at the University of Toronto.
Leitch was the founding chair of the Ivey Centre for Health Innovation and Leadership and led the health sector stream of the MBA programme at the Richard Ivey School of Business located at the University of Western Ontario.
In 2009, Leitch founded the Kids Health Foundation (now known as The Sandbox Project), an organization that sought to work with academia, the not-for-profit sector, government and industry to make Canada the healthiest place on earth for children to grow up.
Leitch maintained their medical credentials while serving in politics, and had hospital privileges at Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa.
Political involvement
Leitch is an active member of the Conservative Party of Canada and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. They were a strategist in Progressive Conservative MPP Christine Elliott's leadership bid in 2009. They also served as president of the Ontario PC Campus Association, and has been actively involved in the Conservative Party since they were 14.
Leitch served as chair of the expert panel for the Children's Fitness Tax Credit in 2006, which made recommendations to Jim Flaherty, Minister of Finance, regarding the best ways to implement this tax credit designed to encourage health and fitness among Canadian children. In 2008, Leitch authored the report entitled Reaching for the Top: A Report by the Advisor on Healthy Children & Youth. The report is a "call to action" for government and industry on key issues affecting Canadian children and youth.
Leitch serves on the boards for CANFAR, the National Research Council, YMCA, and Genome Canada, among others.
Federal politics
On September 17, 2010, The Globe and Mail reported that Leitch would run for the Conservative nomination in Simcoe–Grey. The seat was, at the time, held by Helena Guergis, who was expelled from the Conservative Party. The Globe described Leitch as a "star candidate" and noted that their launch event in Creemore the following day would include former Ontario premier Bill Davis and federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty.
Leitch won the nomination over Collingwood mayor Chris Carrier and Paul Throop with 67% of all ballots cast in a large turnout. Leitch won the general election with more votes than any candidate for public office had ever received in Simcoe–Grey, with 31,784 ballots cast for them and a plurality of 20,590 votes, or 49.36% of the vote. Following their election, Leitch was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development.
Minister of Labour and Minister for the Status of Women
As part of the February 2014 budget, Leitch announced a $25 million plan to address violence against aboriginal women and girls.
On July 15, 2013, Prime Minister Harper named Leitch Minister of Labour and Minister for the Status of Women. During the 2015 Canadian federal election, Leitch said that they were pro-life when asked at a local debate, citing their experience as a paediatric surgeon as their reason.
On October 2, 2015, during the general election, Leitch and then-Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Chris Alexander announced a Royal Canadian Mounted Police "tip line" where Canadians could report "barbaric cultural practices", which, along with the niqab issue, was widely viewed as an attempt to keep cultural and immigration issues at the forefront of the election campaign. Leitch later expressed regret in their involvement of the "barbaric cultural practices tip line". However, in an interview, on the statement the tip line "is a good idea but wasn't communicated as effectively as it could be to the public" they characterised it as being "absolutely correct".
Conservative leadership election
Although Leitch was re-elected in the 2015 election, the Conservatives were relegated to Official Opposition status. During the election, Leitch campaigned with over 70 Conservative candidates, which prepared the groundwork for their participation in the 2017 Conservative leadership election to replace Stephen Harper. Leitch's policy stances faced similar controversy in October 2015 during the federal election, where they and fellow Conservative MP and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander pledged support and funding to establish a tip-line for Canadians to call in regards to what they called "barbaric cultural practices". Leitch has since made an effort to apologize for their role in the proposed legislation, saying that they regret their decisions.
They recruited Nick Kouvalis and Richard Ciano to head their leadership campaign, and Andy Pringle of the Toronto Police Services Board was their chief fundraiser. Leitch was the first official candidate to enter the race.
As part of their leadership campaign, Leitch proposed a Canadian value screening for all new residents. Michael Chong, Conservative MP for Wellington-Halton Hills and an opponent of Leitch in the leadership race, spoke out against Leitch's proposal, saying that it "does not represent our Conservative Party or our Canada". Despite the censure, Leitch stood by their proposal. In a September interview with the Canadian Press, Leitch made the following statement in response to the backlash they had been receiving: "I don't think it's intolerant to believe in a set of values that we expect everyone to share here and include those people who are coming to visit or immigrate to Canada." The focus of their campaign around the policies surprised some of their long-time mentors, such as former Conservative senator Hugh Segal, who couldn't support their leadership bid.
Leitch proposed screening visitors, refugees and immigrants for "Canadian values". This process would include face to face interviews by trained immigration officers with 100% of immigrants, rather than the 10% or so that happens now, with questions pertaining to their views on whether Canadian law should be the only set of laws that applies to all Canadians, hate speech, violence, and equality between genders, sexual orientation, religious & political views. Stephen Maher, based on information they received from former staffers of Letich, argued that their campaign manager Nick Kouvalis, thought that it would give Leitch, a way to win.
In a November 9, 2016 interview with Toronto Life magazine, Leitch cited the belief that gays should not be sentenced to death as an example of one such Canadian value.
During the campaign they were endorsed by Council of European Canadians, but their campaign rejected the endorsement. Regarding the endorsement, Leitch said that for anyone to think their campaign is in any way based on ethnic nationalism is to be willfully ignorant of what their campaign is about.
Leitch finished sixth in the race.
After the leadership race
They were not included into Andrew Scheer's shadow cabinet. In December 2017, it was reported that Essa Township mayor Terry Dowdall and physician Gillian Yeates were challenging Leitch for the Conservative nomination in Simcoe—Grey for the next election. On January 23, 2018, Leitch announced that they would not seek re-election. Leitch threw their support towards Marc Biss and Tim Bulmer, to be the party candidate for their riding arguing that they were "real conservatives" while believing Yeates and Dowdall were not. On March 24, it was announced that Dowdall won the party nomination for their riding after it was rumoured that they defeated Yeates on the third ballot.
On January 23, 2018, Leitch announced that they would not be seeking re-election for the 43rd Canadian federal election and would return to being a full-time surgeon. As of December 1, 2019, they are chief of orthopaedic surgery at Children's of Mississippi.

The Reverend Abraham Bronson (April 11, 1778 - June 12, 1853) was an Episcopalian minister.

Angami Zapu Phizo (16 May 1904 – 30 April 1990) was a Naga nationalist leader with British Nationality. Under their influence, the Naga National Council asserted the right to self-determination which took the shape of armed resistance after the Indian state imposed the Armed Forces Special Powers Act in 1958. Naga secessionist groups regard them as the "Father of the Naga Nation".
Early life
Angami Zapu Phizo was born on 16 May 1913 in Khonoma to an Angami Naga family. They belonged to the Merhüma clan of Khonoma. They had collaborated with the Japanese army in Burma. Their face was heavily twisted following a childhood paralytic attack.
Political life
As the British were preparing for their withdrawal from India, Phizo separately met the indigenous Assamese, Garos, Khasis, Lushais, Abors, Mishmis and Meiteis leaders in an attempt to convince them to form independent countries of their own, instead of joining the proposed Union of India. However, their efforts failed. On 14 August 1947, one day before India gained its independence, Phizo declared the independence of Naga region.
Phizo's influence in the Naga National Council (NNC) increased in late 1940s, after the NNC secretary Imti Aliba Ao retired from politics for an appointment in the Indian Frontier Administrative Services.
Phizo was incarcerated in Calcutta's Presidency Jail in 1948 on charges of stirring trouble in the Indo-Burma borderland. After their release from the jail, they became the fourth president and the main ideologue of the National Naga Council. Phizo became the NNC Chairman in October–November 1949 after defeating Vizar Angami of Zakhama village by a margin of one vote. Under their leadership, the NNC inclined towards seeking secession from India. Phizo urged the Naga people to boycott the Indian elections. They met the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in December 1951 near Tezpur in Assam, in March 1952 at Delhi, and in July 1952 at Dibrugarh. They also met with Jaipal Singh in 1952. They were arrested in Burma for illegal entry.
In September 1954, Phizo formed the "People's Sovereign Republic of Free Nagaland", with the support of Chang chiefs of Tuensang. They also reorganized the NNC setup, as the chances of a peaceful settlement declined.
In 1955, the Angami leaders T. Sakhrie (who had served the secretary of NNC since its inception) and J. B. Jasokie broke off with Phizo at a meeting in the Khonoma village. Phizo got Sakhrie murdered in January 1956. On 22 March 1956 they formed the "Naga Central Government", which was later renamed to "Federal Government of Nagaland" (FGN) in 1959. The new organization had a military wing.
Phizo escaped to East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) in December 1956, from where they went to London. They continued supporting the secessionist movement in Nagaland, until their death in exile, in London in 1990. They had 11 children. When they escaped from the erstwhile Naga Hills to East Pakistan, they did not have an Indian passport. After acquiring a British passport while in London, the Indian embassy refused to issue them a visa to visit India.
Khodao Yanthan said later, "Mr. Phizo was a perfect Naga leader. I don't believe there will be any Naga leader like Mr. Phizo."

First Aberdeen is the main bus company operator in Aberdeen, Scotland. It is a subsidiary of FirstGroup.
History
Aberdeen Corporation
Aberdeen Corporation Tramways was formed on 26 August 1898. The company was renamed Aberdeen Corporation Transport Department when it became solely a bus operator with trams ceasing on 3 May 1958.
Grampian Regional Transport
Under local government reorganisation in 1975, the Aberdeen Corporation bus operations transferred to Grampian Regional Transport, a department of the Grampian Regional Authority.
To comply with the Transport Act 1985, Grampian Regional Transport was incorporated in 1986, with the Grampian Regional Authority retaining ownership.
In January 1989 the company was privatised under an employee stock ownership plan led by its general manager Moir Lockhead. At the time GRT operated a fleet of 200 buses and 500 employees.
Unlike future similar sales in the UK, the sale of Grampian Regional Transport was done voluntarily by the council which had no overall majority party and had no deep rooted objection to the sale. At the time, councils could negotiate privately with single buyers, rather than the later practice of competitive bidding. It was a sale of a going concern, rather than as seen in other areas in later years, a distress sale, or a forced sale for political reasons.
First Grampian
While the company continued to operate as GRT in Aberdeen, its holding company GRT Bus Group expanded through acquisition purchasing six former nationalised bus companies in England and Scotland. In April 1994 GRT Bus Group became a public limited company. In April 1995 FirstBus was formed through the merger of the Badgerline and GRT Bus Groups, with fleets in England, Wales and Scotland. Aberdeen was selected as the headquarters.
In February 1998 Grampian Regional Transport was rebranded as First Aberdeen.
Liveries
Aberdeen Corporation had a dark green and white livery, later becoming pea-green and cream. Council owned Grampian Regional Transport changed this livery, by removing the upper green band, replacing it with a thinner orange band, with Grampian fleetnames and a council crest. When privatised, a scheme with a larger area of cream base colour, supplemented by a two-tone green stripe pattern was adopted.
The cream base and stripe layout would become the corporate livery for the GRT Group, albeit with different colours for the stripes. The First Grampian livery consisted of the existing livery, with the fleetname changed to the FirstBus corporate style with the stylised f symbol. FirstGroup corporate livery was adopted in 1998 upon being rebranded as First Aberdeen.
Fleet
A mainstay of the fleet in the 1970s up to 1983 was the Alexander AL Type bodied Leyland Atlantean, supplemented by the Leyland National single-decker bus. In 1985 it moved to Alexander RH bodied Leyland Olympian double-deckers until 1988. From 1991 to 1997 the company steadily bought the Mercedes-Benz O405 single-decker.
Grampian Regional Transport was one of the first UK users of articulated buses. Aberdeen is one of the major locations for articulated buses in the United Kingdom with around 35 in the fleet in December 2013.
As at March 2013 the fleet consisted of 173 buses and coaches.
In 2014, the firm purchased 26 Wright StreetLite micro-hybrid buses.
First Aberdeen were the world's first operator of double decker Hydrogen Busses, operating of a fleet of 15 Wright StreetDeck Hydroliners since January 2021. The original units were taken off the road in January 2022 due to a "technical fault" and were temporarily replaced with ADL Enviro400 MMCs from First Glasgow. The first of these returned to service in April 2022. 10 more joined the fleet in April 2022, bringing the total to 25.
Daytime Services
A Metro network was introduced on 13 May 2001 as a series of colour-coded high-frequency routes with the promise of no reduction in services in the following three years. In September 2004, a small number of services were withdrawn and minor revisions were made to some existing services.
Metro was later renamed the Overground network in line with other FirstGroup companies. This was a group wide initiative to rationalise route networks into high frequency colour-coded networks running on main routes, to reduce the amount of confusing overlaps and divergences of routes on minor roads.
In 2008, First Aberdeen revamped their entire network axing little used services and focusing on the Overground routes. The required 90% of Aberdeen's timetable to be changed.
On 16 September 2012 First has been introducing a network review of services which is the biggest service change since 2008. The review reduces frequency on most routes. It also removes evening and Sunday services to parts of the city..
Revenue
Most First Aberdeen services are operated commercially, an exception to this is the council subsidised Service 40 which operates from Guild Street to Dubford on Sundays. The company operates an exact fare policy, whereby no change is given by the driver, though they also allow contactless payment along with payment through the First Bus app on the Android and iOS mobile operating systems. The fleet was one of two divisions in FirstBus picked to trial the new "ticketer" ticket machines at the start of 2017.
King Street Headquarters
The company has occupied a historic depot site at 395 King Street at the heart of the city since 1914. It was built in 1862 and bought by Aberdeen Corporation Tramways The site has also served as global headquarters of FirstGroup since its formation in 1995. On 21 June 2007 First gained permission to redevelop the site into a new Aberdeen bus depot and global FirstGroup headquarters building. It was officially opened by Anne, Princess Royal on 15 July 2010.

The Kičevo-Poreče dialect (, Kičevsko-porečki dijalekt) is a member of the central subgroup of the western group of dialects of Macedonian. The dialect is spoken in a vast area in North Macedonia and mainly in the cities Kičevo and Makedonski Brod. It is also native to the villages of the region Poreče, such as Samokov and those around Kičevo. Because of the migration of the population from Poreče, the dialect is spoken in the region of Polog and in the capital Skopje. The Kičevo-Poreče dialect is closely related to the Prilep-Bitola dialect, Gostivar dialect with which they share many common characteristics. This dialect can be found in many books and novels, and one of the more popular is the novel "Milion mačenici" by Risto Krle. The Kičevo-Poreče dialect has a significantly small number of Serbian and Turkish loan words than the Macedonian dialects.
Phonological characteristics
change of the nasal vowel /õ/ with /ɔ/;
change of the vocal /lˌ/ and vocal /rˌ/;
use of the consonant groups шт (št) and жд (žd);
lose of the inter vocal /v/: глава (glava) > глаа (glaa; head).
Morphological characteristics
use of the dative case for personal names: му рече Стојану (mu reče Stojanu; they told to Stojan);
use of the diminutive: дете (dete) > детуле (detule; kid);
use of the suffix -t for third-person singular: тој зборува (toj zboruva) > тој зборуват (toj zboruvat; they talk);
use of the preposition "v" and "vo" (in);
linking of the prepositions or clitics with the verb: јас ќ'ода (jas ḱ'oda) instead of јас ќе одам (jas ḱe odam; I will go);
losing of the suffix "-m" for first-person singular: јас зборувам (jas zboruvam) > ја зборува (ja zboruva; I talk);
use of "ja" instead "jas" (I);
use of "su" instead "sum" (am): јас сум (jas sum) > ја су (ja su; I am).
Examples of the dialect
Omarno žeško sonce is a song that is written on Kičevo-Poreče dialect.
Омарно жешко сонце грејт
и никој на земата не смејт
очи да отворит, ура, ура.
И никој на земјата не смејт
очи да отворит, напред, напред.
Ја народ црнејт, таму на брего
и ноќта ангел јасно викаше:
„О, Боже, до кога и до Бога?“
и ноќта ангел јасно викаше:
„О, Боже, до кога и до Бога?“
Omarno žeško sonce grejt
i nikoj na zemjata ne smejt
oči da otvorit, ura, ura.
I nikoj na zemjata ne smejt
oči da otvorit, napred, napred.
Ja narod crnejt, tamu na brego
i noḱta angel jasno vikaše:
„O Bože, do koga i do Boga?“
i noḱta angel jasno vikaše:
„O Bože, do koga i do Boga?“

Eugenia petrikensis is a species of flowering plants belonging to the genus Eugenia and was described in 2012 by Neil Snow and coauthors. It is a large shrub with magenta-coloured flowers and was discovered from Toliara Province at the eastern shoreline of Madagascar. It is one of the seven novel species of Eugenia described from the region, in addition to E. guajavoides, E. manonae, E. stictophylla, E. roseopetiolata and E. stibephylla. It is an endangered species according to the IUCN Red List. The specific epithet is derived from the name of the area, Petriky, from where it was discovered.
The plant was among the Top 10 New Species discovered in 2012 selected by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University out of more than 140 nominated species among more than 18,000 new species. The uniqueness is its rare occurrence, a large shrub with its beautiful bunch of flowers hanging on its branchlets. The selection was publicised on 22 May 2013.
Nomenclature
Eugenia petrikensis is so named as it was found in the Petriky Forest (and also in the adjacent Ambinanibe Forest). The Malagasy name is ropasy lahiny. Ropasy is a contraction of rotra (a vernacular name for Eugenia) and fasika, which refers to sand; thus ropasy means "Eugenia that grows on sand". When more than one species of a genus is found in the region a second name is often added for distinction, such as lahiny for male or vaviny for female.
Description
Eugenia petrikensis is a shrub growing up to 3 m with characteristic emerald green, slightly glossy foliage and beautiful, dense clusters of small magenta flowers. The green leaves are coriaceous and evenly distributed along branchlets. The leaf venation is brochidodromous. The branchlets are moderately to densely sericeous on emergence but becoming sparsely so to nearly glabrous. Stipules are absent. Petioles are 3.0–4.5 mm, wrinkled, glabrous and yellowish-green. Leaf blades are elliptical with the base cuneate to rounded. Inflorescence is axillary or ramiflorous, consisting of monads or 3–flowered cymes, solitary, paired or generally in fascicles. Peduncles are 2–5 mm long, medium green, and glabrous or with a few scattered hairs. Calyx is 4-lobed, rounded to oblong, the apex broadly rounded and glabrous. Petals are 4 in number, ovate, magenta but hyaline on margins. Stamens are 20–30 in number arranged in 1 or 2 series. Fruits are globose, glabrous, and yellow in colour when ripe. Flowering time is from late October to February, and fruiting from December to March.
Significance
Eugenia petrikensis is an unusual shrub found in the humid forest on sandy substrate of Madagascar. It occurs only in the littoral forest on the shoreline of the eastern region, which has had its span reduced from about to isolated portions due to human development. This big shrub with its colourful flowers, a cluster of magenta, is already quite notable. In addition it is a rare endangered species found nowhere else on earth.

This includes coverage of related technologies where appropriate, for example, remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS), the internet, satellite navigation and positioning systems, laser scanning, and terrain modelling. The Journal also publishes articles on social, political and historical aspects of cartography. Occasionally, Special Issues are published that focus on a particular research theme.
Its readership is drawn from over 180 countries and encompasses: academics and students; research and educational institutions, senior representatives of national mapping agencies; software suppliers and users; cartographic technicians; cartographic producers and publishers; oil exploration companies; librarians; designers; and other professional bodies and practitioners.
The Cartographic Journal is published quarterly and its one-year impact factor is 1.366 and five-year impact factor is 1.516 (2021). Its current editor-in-chief is Dr Alexander James Kent, Reader in Cartography and Geographic Information Science at Canterbury Christ Church University.
Each year since 1975, the British Cartographic Society has run the Henry Johns Award (sponsored by cartographic firm Lovell Johns) for the most outstanding paper published in the preceding Volume (year). Nominations are submitted to the Editor by members of the international Editorial Board and the paper receiving the highest number is deemed the winner. The award (comprising £100 and a certificate) is usually presented to the author(s) at the Society's Annual Symposium.

Jacob ben Hayyim Zemah (17th century) was a Portuguese kabalist and physician. They received a medical training in their native country as a Marrano, but fled about 1619 to Safed and devoted themselves to the Talmud and the casuists ("poseḳim") until 1625; then they went to Damascus, where for eighteen years they studied kabbalah from the Zohar and the writings of Isaac Luria and Hayyim Vital. They finally settled at Jerusalem and opened a yeshivah for the study of the Zohar and other kabbalistic works, David Conforte being for some time one of their pupils.
Author
Jacob Ẓemaḥ was one of the greatest kabbalists of their period and was a prolific author, their works including treatises of their own as well as compilations of the writings of Ḥayyim Vital. They produced twenty works, of which only two have been published. The first of these is the Ḳol ba-Ramah (Korez, 1785), a commentary on the Idra, which they began in 1643, and for which they utilized the commentary of Ḥayyim Vital. In the preface to this work they maintained that the coming of the Messiah depended on repentance ("teshuvah") and on the study of kabbalah from the Zohar and the writings of Isaac Luria, the delay in the advent of the Messiah being because schools for such study had not been established in every town.
Their second published work is the Nagid u-Meẓawweh (Amsterdam, 1712), on the mystical meaning of the prayers, this being an abridgment of a compendium which Ẓemaḥ composed on the basis of a more comprehensive treatise.
Among their unpublished works, special mention may be made of the Ronnu le-Ya'aḳob, in which they call themselves "the proselyte" ("ger ẓedeḳ"). This treatise consists of notes recorded while studying under Samuel Vital and supplemented by their own additions. In their compilation of Ḥayyim Vital's writings, Ẓemaḥ pretended to have discovered many works of Vital which were unknown to the latter's son Samuel.
Death
They died at Jerusalem in the second half of the 17th century.

The Mysuru peta (peta is a Kannada word which means turban in English) is the classical royal Indian attire worn by the erstwhile Kings of Mysore. Wodeyars wore a richly bejeweled turban made of silk and jari (gold threaded lace) to match with colorful dresses as part of the royal dress.
Administrators under the King, such as the Dewans (Prime Minister appointed by the King) and other senior officials who swayed considerable power in matters of state administration also wore the Mysuru peta.
After India became independent in 1947 and the princely state merged with the Indian union, the traditional Mysuru peta has been retained as a symbol of heritage and cultural antecedents and distinguished people are honoured by the award of a Mysore peta with a shawl in formal functions.
Ancient tradition
Kings wore the traditional Mysuru peta as headgear during the Durbar (court of Indian or princley state's kings) time or in a ceremonial procession during the Dassara celebrations and or during joint ceremonial parades with the visiting royal dignitaries from foreign countries.
It was expected that the men attending King's court wore the conventional attire called the durbar dress which comprised a black long coat with white trousers and a compulsory Mysuru peta (turban).
Design
The attractive and colourful turban is a headdress made up of long scarf–like single piece of cloth made of silk or cotton wound round the head cap and is often decorated with jari border (golden or silver laces) and beautiful metal pendants that adds to its glory and grandeur.
In the early 1930s, the "Imperial Hatworks" located in heritage buildings called the Hatworks Boulevard (150 years old history), at No. 32, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru, used to make the "pretied Mysuru peta" for the Maharajah of Mysuru. This place was owned by Manackjee who had set up shop after studying hatmaking in the UK. But this shop closed down a few years after Manackjee's death in 1959. The old–world ambiance of the Hatworks Boulevard has been restored as a minor tourist place with a boutique, French spa, cafe–and–pastry shop, an art gallery (through a tie–up with Crimson Art Gallery), a home furnishing store, an art costume jewellery store and a shop selling custom–made marble pieces.
Social and religious tradition
The people of the Mysuru district and the Kodagu district feel proud to wear turbans called Mysuru peta. In Kodagu district, it is part of the traditional dress worn on special occasions such as weddings. Men wear a turban during religious ceremonies to portray respect and reverence towards the Supreme Being. Distinguished people are honoured by the award of a Mysuru peta in formal functions.
University Convocation cap
Convocation caps are adorned by students and faculty during convocation ceremonies. This practice has been changed by to Inter–University Board (IUB) of Karnataka, which has ruled that students passing out of the nine universities in Karnataka shall no longer wear the traditional black cap – the mortarboard (as it was considered a British legacy) - during their proud moments. Instead, universities have been given the option of using the traditional Mysuru peta.
The academic cap or square, commonly known as the "mortarboard", a symbol of the academia is a flat square hat with a tassel suspended from a button in the top centre of the board. The tassel is made of a cluster of silk threads, which are fastened by a button at one end and fixed at the centre of the headpiece. In Karnataka University Convocation, students have now the option to wear the Karnataka's traditional Mysuru peta, a turban made of silk or cotton cloth with jari tied to the head in a traditional way (tied Mysuru petas or turbans are readily marketed for the purpose in most major cities of the state).

WCOX (1450 AM) was a radio station licensed to serve Camden, Alabama. The station was last owned by Down Home Broadcasting. It last aired a Gospel music format.
This station was a daytime-only station broadcasting on 1540 kHz before going full-time on 1450 kHz. The license got cancelled on New Year's Eve 2020.
History
In May 1981, the station's broadcast license was transferred to Harry A. Taylor and Betty J. Taylor doing business as Taylor and Taylor.
In June 1986, Taylor and Taylor reached an agreement to sell WCOX to Wilcox Network, Inc. The deal was approved by the Federal Communications Commission on September 29, 1986, and the transaction was consummated on November 4, 1986.
In February 1991, Wilcox Network, Inc., reached an agreement to sell the station to Down Home Broadcasting. The FCC approved the deal on April 8, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on April 28, 1991.
License issues
The station filed a routine license renewal request on June 8, 2004. However, this application was filed six months after it was due and two months after the license had already expired. As the licensee had also failed to pay the required regulatory fees, the FCC dismissed the renewal application on January 12, 2005, and ordered the station to cease broadcast operations. The station's license was cancelled and its callsign deleted from the FCC database on June 24, 2005.
The station continued normal broadcast operations in defiance of the FCC's order and applied for reinstatement of their license on May 22, 2006. After more than seven months of deliberation, the FCC decided to restore the station's license and callsign even after finding that Down Home Broadcasting "apparently willfully and repeatedly violated" FCC rules and "unauthorized operation" for which they were fined $14,000.
The station was reassigned the WCOX call letters by the FCC on January 31, 2007. On March 7, 2007, the station's license was reinstated after the fine had been paid and other regulatory requirements had been satisfied. On April 6, 2012, the FCC again cancelled the station's license and deleted its callsign from the FCC database.
The station's license was reinstated in July 2013 and the station went silent on January 24, 2015, to prepare to be sold to new owners. WYVC FM will continue to be owned and operated by Down Home Broadcasting.
The license got cancelled again on New Year's Eve 2020.

Daggubati Venkatesh, credited as Raja, is an Indian actor who has acted in Tamil, Malayalam and Telugu language films. The actor made their debut in the 1981 Tamil film, Paakku Vethalai, before going on to become a leading actor in the Tamil film industry from 1986 to 2000.
They went on to play second lead roles and supporting characters in several films including Kamal Haasan's Sathi Leelavathi and Rajinikanth's Mappillai. They have also acted in few Telugu films like Chinnari Sneham, Sankellu and Shri Krishnarjuna Vijayam.
 They are a relative of veteran film producer late D. Ramanaidu.
Career
A nephew of Telugu film producer D. Ramanaidu, Daggubati Venkatesh was persuaded by their family to become an actor in Tamil cinema owing to their familiarity with Madras. They subsequently joined Bharathiraja's acting school, where they trained before getting their first major career breakthrough with the director's romantic drama Kadalora Kavithaigal (1986). To differentiate from their namesake cousin, Venkatesh was given the screen name "Raja". The box office success of Kadalora Kavithaigal prompted Bharathiraja to cast them again in Vedham Pudhithu (1987), and the popular song "Kannukkul Nooru" earned Raja a large female fanbase.
Raja continued portraying supporting roles in films, and was unable to garner much success as a lead actor. Their appearance in a negative role in their collaboration with Manivannan for Ini Oru Suthanthiram was well received by critics, though their best known work in the late 1980s and early 1990s featured them in supporting roles such as in Mappillai (1989) and Pudhu Vasantham (1990). In the early 1990s, they were often typecast in soft, demure characters often portraying a gentle romantic, who regularly lost out to film's lead actor. Their most notable films of the period, Sathi Leelavathi (1995), Love Birds (1996) and Kadhal Kottai (1996) all featured them in similar roles. They quickly became disheartened at the films and secondary characters being offered to him, and opted to move into business in 1999. and currently runs a granite business called "Cosmo Granites" in Chennai.
After nineteen years break from films, Raja returned to acting with a role in Krish's biopic drama N.T.R: Kathanayakudu (2019), where they portrayed the supporting role of Trivikrama Rao. They made their return to Tamil films through Adithya Varma (2019), where they appeared as the father of the titular character played by debutant Dhruv Vikram.

The twenty-ninth season of the animated television series The Simpsons premiered on Fox in the United States on October 1, 2017, and ended on May 20, 2018. On November 4, 2016, The Simpsons was renewed for seasons 29 and 30. This season marked the show's surpassing Gunsmoke as the longest-running scripted series in primetime television by number of episodes, with the series' 636th episode "Forgive and Regret".
Episodes
Production
Development
During February 2018, episodes of The Simpsons were held back to avoid competing with the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, Super Bowl LII, the 2018 Winter Olympics, and the 90th Academy Awards. This resulted in a nine-week gap in between new episodes, and is the second season to not have any new episodes airing in February, after the twenty-fifth season (which also aired in a Winter Olympics year).
Casting
The season features guest appearances from Norman Lear, Martin Short, Ray Liotta and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. In addition, Bill Plympton animated a sixth couch gag in "3 Scenes Plus a Tag from a Marriage", having previously done so in season 23's "Beware My Cheating Bart", season 24's "Black Eyed, Please", season 25's "Married to the Blob", season 27's "Lisa the Veterinarian", and season 28's "22 for 30". This season also features Kelsey Grammer reprising their role as Sideshow Bob and Homer seeking help from Shaquille O'Neal ("Gone Boy"), and a song written by guest star Rachel Bloom ("Springfield Splendor"). The season also includes the Simpson family traveling to New Orleans for JazzFest ("Lisa Gets the Blues"), and an episode that reimagines Stephen King's It's featuring Krusty the Clown ("Fears of a Clown").
Music
On August 30, 2017, it was announced that longtime Simpsons score composer Alf Clausen was let go from the series. The series switched from a live orchestrated score to a produced score by Bleeding Fingers Music. Hans Zimmer (who composed the score for The Simpsons Movie) and Russel Emanuel are score producers, with Steve Kofsky executive producing. Clausen's last episode was "Whistler's Father".

Hapoel Ramot Menashe Megiddo () is an Israeli football club representing Kibbutz Ramot Menashe and the Megiddo Regional Council. The club currently plays in Liga Bet North B division.
History
The club was founded in 1971 and started playing in the regional leagues, which were not affiliated with the Israel Football Association and mostly involved football clubs from other kibbutzim. In 1995 the club joined the Israel Football Association and started at the Liga Gimel bay division. In the 1999–2000 season, the club finished runners-up in Liga Gimel Jezreel division and were promoted to Liga Bet for the first time in their history, after one spot was vacated in that league, following the merger between Hapoel Kiryat Shmona (played in Liga Alef) and Maccabi Kiryat Shmona (played in Liga Bet), which became Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona.
The club relegated back to Liga Gimel after they finished bottom in Liga Bet North A division in the 2001–02 season and remained in Liga Gimel until the 2007–08 season, where they finished runners-up and were promoted to Liga Bet as the best runners-up in Liga Gimel North divisions, once again after one spot was vacated, this time after Maccabi Tur'an were folded.
In the 2009–10 season the club finished third in Liga Bet North B division and qualified for the promotion play-offs. After beating Maccabi Ahi Iksal, Hapoel Iksal and Hapoel Ihud Bnei Sumei, they faced Hapoel Bnei Jadeidi in the decisive promotion/relegation play-offs. Hapoel Ramot Menashe Megiddo won 3–2 after coming back from 0–2 and promoted to Liga Alef.
In the 2010–11 season, the club finished bottom in Liga Alef North and relegated back to Liga Bet, where they play today.
Hapoel Ramot Menashe Megiddo is currently the only football club representing the Kibbutz Movement.

William Octavius Moberly (14 November 1850 – 2 February 1914) was an English sportsman who played first-class cricket for Gloucestershire and represented the England national rugby union team.
Early life and education
Moberly was educated at Rugby School, before going to Balliol College, Oxford. They won a blue for rugby in 1872 and until 1874 played for the university. This included the first ever Varsity Match against Cambridge in 1872, with Moberly captaining Oxford to victory. They also played two first-class cricket matches for Oxford, against the Gentlemen of England in 1870 and 1872.
Rugby career
As a wing-three-quarter, they took part in the second ever rugby international between England and Scotland, in 1872. The match, which took part at The Oval, was won by England. Although at club level they always played three-quarter, they were picked as a fullback for England. They were described as a clever runner, who could "drop with either foot, and was a good shot at goal." At club level, Moberly turned out for the Ravenscourt Park Football Club.
They were appointed as an assistant master at Clifton College in 1874 and began playing for the Clifton Rugby Football Club two years later.
Cricket career
Although their duties at Clifton restricted their appearances in first-class cricket, Moberly began playing with Gloucestershire in 1876 was a member of the teams which were the Champion County that year as well as the next. They were used as a top order batsman but would also fill in as wicket-keeper whenever fellow rugby union international and Clifton teammate James Bush was injured or unavailable.
In a match against Yorkshire in Cheltenham 1876, Moberly scored 103 and their captain W. G. Grace an unbeaten 318 when they put on 261 runs for the fifth wicket. It remains to this day a Gloucestershire fifth wicket partnership record. They finished the season with 245 runs at 40.83, their best year in terms of average but they had their most prolific summer in 1883 when they amassed 351 runs at 29.25. The latter tally included their highest first-class score of 121, which they scored in a win over Somerset at Taunton.

Dragonflier is a Vekoma Suspended Family Coaster at Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The coaster debuted in 2019 as part of the $37 million, 5.5-acre Wildwood Grove park area, which was targeted at families and children. The ride features a seven-story first drop into a tunnel, a top speed of , and a total track length of . This is the first 453m clone in the United States.
History
In October 2017, the park began clearing out and leveling massive swaths of land in between the Timber Canyon area of the park and the Dollywood Express train course, which was immediately deduced to be a 2019 park expansion and leading to intense speculation on what was to come in the park's future years. Following land clearing taking place throughout the winter, it was reported in February 2018 that Dollywood officials were meeting with members of the Pigeon Forge Planning Commission in order to discuss the development of a 5-acre plot of land located between the Thunderhead coaster and the parking lot. In March 2018, plans submitted to the Planning Commission were uncovered and broadcast online, showing off a family-intended park expansion, which included several flat rides and an inverted coaster, which was quickly deduced to be the 453m variant of the popular Dutch firm Vekoma's Suspended Family Coaster model.
With land clearing completed, early construction began on the new area, with footers being poured of the then-unknown Dragonflier coaster in July 2018. Amid several teasers, the name and logo of the new area, Wildwood Grove, became public knowledge on July 24, and the park subsequently set an announcement date for August 3, 2018. On the said date, Dragonflier was formally announced by Dolly Parton and park staff as part of the $37,000,000 Wildwood Grove, which would offer several new rides and amenities, as well as their first expansion to the park's footprint since 2008.
After track began arriving in September 2018, Dragonflier quickly went vertical and was mostly constructed during the fall, with 85% of the layout reportedly having been completed by late November 2018. By 2019, the track was completed, and work would continue throughout the winter on the surrounding area and station in order to meet the anticipated May 2019 opening. The coaster began testing in and around April 2019, and Wildwood Grove - including Dragonflier - had its grand opening on May 10, 2019.
Characteristics
Statistics
Dragonflier has a top speed of and a total length of . Although the ride reaches a max height of , its layout stays relatively low to the ground. The coaster is noted for its first drop, which plunges into a short tunnel and thus surpasses they ride's height. It runs a single, 20 passenger trains, which restrains guests with lap bars and is mounted below the track; typical for an inverted coaster. The ride's lift hill also utilizes drive tires instead of the traditional chain lift used on the majority of inverted/suspended coasters, thus rendering the climb to the top of the hill as a quiet one.
Model
Dragonflier was manufactured by Dutch-firm Vekoma, and is one of the 453m clones of their Suspended Family Coaster model. The original, Orkanen at Fårup Sommarland in Denmark, was opened in 2013 and has its first tunneled drop diving into the lagoon. As of 2021, 11 of the 453m variant are either in operation or under construction across the globe.
Ride experience
Dispatching the station, riders make a 90° left turn into the lift hill, which utilizes drive tires to propel the train to its height. Upon reaching the top, riders bank slightly to the left and plunge into a subterranean tunnel, rising up into a forceful overbanked turn (similar to a Cutback). The train speeds up into a helix, following a jump over the station building and yet another helix. Riders twist into a turnaround and make a final 90° turn into the station, where the train comes to a stop. The entire ride lasts just one minute.
Reception
Dragonflier and the collective area of Wildwood Grove received unanimous praise from local media and park guests alike. Dragonflier itself received praise for its layout, aesthetics, ride experience, and appeal to both children and thrill seekers alike, while coaster enthusiasts lauded its surprise forces and smooth tracking. On September 9, 2019, Wildwood Grove won a prestiged Golden Ticket Award from coaster industry newspaper Amusement Today for Best Kids Area.

The Tortoise heavy assault tank (A39) was a British heavy assault gun design developed during the Second World War, but never put into mass production. It was developed for the task of clearing heavily fortified areas such as the Siegfried Line and as a result favoured armour protection over mobility.
Although heavy, at 78 tons, and not readily transported, it was considered reliable and a good gun platform.
Only a few prototypes of the Tortoise had been produced by the end of the war. After testing was complete, one was retained for preservation and the others disposed of.
Development
In the early part of 1943, the Allied forces anticipated considerable resistance in the projected future invasion of Europe, with the enemy fighting from heavily fortified positions such as the Siegfried Line. As a result, a new class of vehicles emerged, in the shape of assault tanks, which placed maximum armour protection at a higher priority than mobility. Initially, work was concentrated on the Excelsior tank (A33), based on the Cromwell tank. There was also a programme to upgrade the armour of the Churchill tank. For similar work in the Far East, the Valiant tank (A38), based on the Valentine tank was considered, although weight was specified to be as low as possible.
The Secretary of State for War (James Grigg) and the Minister of Supply (Andrew Duncan) issued a Joint Memorandum in April 1943 that gave a vague specification for an assault tank, classing it as a special purpose vehicle to operate in heavily defended areas as part of the specialist 79th Armoured Division.
The Nuffield Organization responded with 18 separate designs (AT1 through AT18) drafted between May 1943 and February 1944, each design larger and heavier than the last. By February 1944, design AT16 was complete and was approved by the Tank Board, who proposed that month that 25 should be produced directly from the mockup stage without bothering with a prototype, to be available for operational service in September 1945. An order for 25 was placed by the War Office and work was begun.
Following the end of the war the order was reduced and only six vehicles were built. One example was sent to Germany for trials, where it was found to be mechanically reliable and a powerful and accurate gun platform. However, at a weight of 80 tons and a height of it was extremely slow and proved difficult to transport.
Description
The primary requirement for an assault tank is armour, to enable the tank to assault a heavily emplaced enemy. This led to Tortoise having very thick armour, arranged as a one piece casemate to avoid the weak spots of a turret design. This differs from the design of other wartime era assault tanks, the Excelsior tank and Assault Tank T14.
Since the Tortoise had a fixed casemate superstructure instead of a turret, it can be classified as a self-propelled gun or an assault gun and not a tank. The crew included a commander, driver, and gunner, with two loaders for the 32-pounder gun and two machine gunners.
Internally, it was split into three compartments: the transmission to the front, the crew in the centre and the Rolls-Royce Meteor engine at the rear. The suspension consisted of four bogies on each side of the hull. Each bogie had two pairs of wheels, with each pair linked to a transverse torsion bar. The Merritt-Brown transmission was fitted with an all speed reverse, giving approximately the same speed backwards as forwards.
Armament
The Ordnance QF 32-pounder gun design was adapted from the British 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun. The ammunition used a separate charge and shell, the latter a armour piercing shot (APCBC). In tests, the gun was successful against a German Panther tank at nearly .
The 32-pdr gun was mounted in a power-assisted limited traverse mounting; rather than being mounted on the more traditional trunnions, it protruded through a large ball mount in the front of the hull, protected by armour. To the left of it was a Besa machine gun in an armoured ball mount. A further two Besa machine guns were mounted in a turret on the top of the hull to the right.
Surviving vehicles
One of the six prototype Tortoises constructed of mild steel has been preserved at The Tank Museum in Bovington, England. The vehicle is in running condition. A 2011 overhaul saw it running under its own power for the first time since the 1950s. It was shown to the public in June 2011 at Tankfest 2011, the Bovington museum's annual display of running vehicles.
A Tortoise, without its gun, lies on the former Kirkcudbright military training area (now a Site of Special Scientific Interest) in Scotland. The location and condition of the vehicle mean that recovery and restoration is unlikely.
Another Tortoise was used as a target on Lulworth Ranges, Dorset in the early 1970s. By August 1974 it was little more than a metal shell.

Nickforce was an improvised formation of the British First Army in the Tunisian campaign of the Second World War. It was hastily formed from elements of the British 6th Armoured Division on 14 February 1943, for the defence of Thala, during the latter stages of the Battle of Kasserine Pass. It took its name from the commanding officer, Brigadier Cameron Nicholson. In desperate fighting, the force successfully blocked a Kampfgruppe of the 10th Panzer Division, under the direct control of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, on 21 and 22 February.

The Temples Historic District encompasses a distinctive collection of Greek Revival houses on Madison Street in the rural village of North Anson, Maine. Built between about 1844 and 1858 were four houses in a row, three of which exhibit classical Greek temple-front facades, and assemblage that is unique in the rural interior of the state. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
Description and history
The village of North Anson is located on the north bank of the Carrabassett River, shortly before it empties into the Kennebec River in southern Somerset County, Maine. Madison Street extends eastward from the village center. On the south side of Madison Street stand four houses that are remarkably similar in construction and style. Three stand to the west of Winter Street, and one to the east. All are 1-1/2 stories in height, with wood framing and clapboard siding. All have a front-facing gable roof, and three of them have a Greek temple portico supported by three Doric columns. The two westernmost houses are virtually identical, with a detailed Doric entablature encircling the eave and an ornamented Greek Revival entrance surround. The house at the eastern end is similar to these, but has less detailing on the entablature and entrance surround. The fourth house lacks a temple front, although it may at one time have had one. It has thick pilasters at the corners and a simple entablature, and is fronted by a Colonial Revival porch. Its front facade is also finished in flushboard, and there is an Italianate round-arch window in the gable.
The exact date of construction of the houses is not known, nor is the identity of the (likely single) builder. They were probably built between about 1844 and 1852, late in the Greek Revival period. The house with Italianate features was owned by a carpenter, Ebenezer F. Witherill, and the other three were owned by business people and merchants. It is surmised that Witherill built all four houses, and added the Italianate features to their own house (removing its temple front) to showcase architectural fashion trends.

The 1918–19 season was Stoke's fourth season in the non-competitive War League.
With the start of World War I, all Football League football was cancelled. In its place were formed War Leagues, based on geographical lines rather than based on previous league placement. Stoke contested the Lancashire Section in the Principal Tournament, and the Lancashire Section Secondary Competition Group C. However, none of these were considered to be competitive football, and thus their records are not recognised by the Football League.
Season review
The final war-time season of 1918–19 saw Stoke take the runners-up spot behind Everton. Stoke were again in impressive goal scoring form among those victories were those of 8–1 over Port Vale, 7–0 v Blackburn Rovers and 7–1 v Bolton Wanderers. Bob Whittingham top scored again with 23 goals taking their war-time total for Stoke to 86. With the war now over it was announced that the Football League would return for the 1919–20 season and Stoke were due to enter the Second Division.

William Greenfield (1 April 1799 – 5 November 1831) was an English philologist.
Greenfield was born in London on 1 April 1799. Their father, William Greenfield, a native of Haddington, attended Well Street Chapel, London, then under the ministry of Alexander Waugh. They joined a missionary voyage in the ship Duff, and was accidentally drowned when their son was two years old. In the spring of 1802 Greenfield was taken by their mother to Jedburgh. In the summer of 1810 they returned to London, and Greenfield resided for some time with their two maternal uncles, who gave them instruction. They were men of business who studied languages in order to understand learned quotations, and they taught him.
In October 1812 Greenfield was apprenticed to a bookbinder named Rennie. A Jew employed in their master's house, and a reader of the law in the synagogue, taught them Hebrew gratuitously. At sixteen Greenfield began to teach in the Fitzroy Sabbath School, of which their master was a conductor. At seventeen they became a member of Well Street Chapel, and a close friend of the minister, Dr. Waugh.
In 1824 they left business to devote themselves to languages and biblical criticism. In 1827 they published The Comprehensive Bible … with … a general introduction … Notes, &c. The book, though fiercely attacked as heterodox by the 'Record' and a Dr. Henderson, became very popular, especially among Unitarians. An abridgment was afterwards published as The Pillar of Divine Truth immoveably fixed on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets. … The whole of the arguments and illustrations drawn from the pages of the Comprehensive Bible, by …[W. Greenfield], 8vo,London, 1831. Greenfield's valuable Defence of the Serampore Mahratta Version of the New Testament (in reply to the Asiatic Journal for September, 1829), 8vo, London, 1830, commended them to the notice of the British and Foreign Bible Society, by whom they were engaged, about April of that year, as superintendent of the editorial department. They had no previous knowledge of the Mahratta and other languages referred to in the pamphlet, which, it is said, was written within five weeks of theirs taking up the subject. They followed it up by A Defence of the Surinam Negro-English Version of the New Testament …, 1830 (in reply to the Edinburgh Christian Instructor).
While nineteen months in the society's service Greenfield wrote upon twelve European, five Asiatic, one African, and three American languages; and acquired considerable knowledge of Peruvian, Surinam Creole, Chippeway, and Berber. Their last undertaking for the society was the revision of the Modern Greek Psalter as it went through the press. They also projected a grammar in thirty languages, but in the midst of their labours they were struck down by brain fever, dying at Islington on 5 November 1831. They left a widow and five children, on whose behalf a subscription was opened Their portrait by Hayter was engraved by Holl. Greenfield was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society.

Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) is a national Catholic healthcare system, with headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. CHI is a nonprofit, faith-based health system formed, in 1996, through the consolidation of three Catholic health systems. It is one of the nation's largest healthcare systems. In February 2019, CHI merged with Dignity Health, forming CommonSpirit Health.
History
Founding
CHI began operations in 1996. The founding systems were the Catholic Health Corporation of Omaha, Nebraska, the Franciscan Health System of Aston, Pennsylvania, and the Sisters of Charity Health Care Systems of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Expansion
In September 1997, the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth Health System in Nazareth, Kentucky consolidated with Catholic Health Initiatives. In March 1998, the Sisters of St. Francis of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Hankinson, North Dakota transferred sponsorship of a hospital and eight clinics to CHI. In September 2010, Consolidated Health Services, a home care service provider with 30 locations in Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, joined CHI. Home health is later re-branded as CHI Health at Home. In May 2013, St. Luke's Episcopal Health System, a six-hospital system based in Houston, Texas, joined CHI as St. Luke's Health System. The organization included outpatient clinics in Houston and affiliations with Baylor College of Medicine, Kelsey-Seybold Clinic, Texas Heart Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, and MD Anderson Cancer Center. On April 1, 2014, Mercy Health of Hot Springs, Arkansas signed a definitive agreement to transfer ownership of Mercy Hot Springs hospital and medical group to CHI St. Vincent. In June 2014, CHI St. Luke's Health Memorial of Lufkin, Texas joined CHI. In October 2014, CHI St. Alexius Health of Bismarck, North Dakota becomes a direct affiliate of CHI, adding St. Alexius Medical Center and two critical access hospitals to the system. In November 2014, Sylvania Franciscan Health becomes part of CHI, adding St. Joseph Health System in the Brazos Valley region of Texas; Franciscan Living Communities in Kentucky and Ohio; and three hospitals in eastern Ohio to the system In January 2016, Brazosport Regional Health System in Lake Jackson, Texas joins CHI St. Luke's Health, Houston. In December 2017, Dignity Health and CHI announce a definitive agreement to merge.
CHI has expanded since 2011, entering new states and expanding in existing ones. CHI also acquired the health insurer QualChoice, but was unsuccessful in its ownership; QualChoice is currently for sale.
2019 merger
In 2018, Dignity Health and Catholic Health Initiatives received a merger approval from the Catholic Church, through the Vatican. Merged on February 1, 2019, as CommonSpirit Health, the new company formed as the largest Catholic health system, and the second-largest nonprofit hospital chain, in the United States.
In January 2019, the KentuckyOne Health system decided to transition to the legacy of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, Lexington's first hospital. Focusing on central and southern Kentucky, it is one of the largest health organizations in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. KentuckyOne Health system hospitals and clinics in the Louisville area was later purchased by the University of Louisville's UofL Health.
Operations
Colorado-based CHI is one of the nation's largest health systems, operating in 18 states and comprising 104 hospitals, including four academic health centers and major teaching hospitals and 30 critical-access facilities; community health-services organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home-health agencies; and other facilities that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care.
In fiscal year 2014, CHI provided $910 million in charity care and community benefit - a nearly 20% increase over the previous year - for programs and services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. Charity care and community benefit totaled more than $1.7 billion with the inclusion of the unpaid costs of Medicare. The health system, which generated revenues of almost $3.9 billion (FY 2018), has total assets of $5.1 billion.
Shareholder activism
CHI practices shareholder activism by purchasing shares in publicly-traded corporations and engaging with corporate management on environmental, social and corporate governance issues. Following the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, in example; Catholic Health Initiatives was the lead filer, co-filing with the Adrian Dominican Sisters, of a shareholder resolution asking firearms manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Co. to report to investors regarding the steps they are taking to reduce gun violence. Ruger opposed the resolution. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager and Ruger's largest investor, as well as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, the two most important shareholder advisory firms in the United States, supported the resolution. At Ruger's annual meeting on May 9, 2018, 69 percent of shareholders voted in favor and Ruger agreed to heed the resolution. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence called the vote a "first-of-its-kind victory."
Controversy
In January 2013, the hospital's defense lawyers provoked controversy when they defended against a wrongful death lawsuit by arguing that unborn fetuses should not be classed as persons. This contradicted Catholic doctrine established by Pope John Paul II. When the case was submitted to the three bishops of Colorado for review, they issued a joint statement which reiterated their commitment to defending human dignity against attacks.

Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (London Edition) is commonly known as the Third or London Edition and sometimes the Stinking Edition. It is a collection of poetry and songs by Robert Burns, printed for A. Strahan; T. Cadell in the Strand; and W. Creech, Edinburgh. MDCCLXXXVII The date of publication for the London Edition was in November 1787, however Strahan and Cadell had previously advertised for sale the 'Second' or 'Edinburgh Edition' using the 500 or so copies that William Creech still had that were unsold. The successful selling of these made a truly new 'London Edition' a commercially viable enterprise.
The Kilmarnock Edition made Robert Burns Caledonia's Bard whilst the 'Edinburgh Edition' and the 'London Edition' elevated them into a position amongst the world's greatest poets.
The Edition and its contents
It was called the third published edition of Burns's poems, their first edition having been printed in Kilmarnock in 1786, however pirated editions had already been published in Belfast and Dublin making it in reality the fifth edition. The true 'London Edition' cost 7 shillings. It is not known how many copies of the 'London Edition' were printed. Around 3,250 copies of the 'Edinburgh Edition' had been printed and only 612 copies of the Kilmarnock Edition of which 84 are known to survive, but no record exists of the number of the London and Edinburgh Editions that are extant.
The volume was again dedicated to the Noblemen and Gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt. The 1787 London and Edinburgh editions contain an extra seventeen poems and five new songs. In addition most of the poems present in the 1786 Kilmarnock Edition are reprinted such as "Halloween", "The Twa Dogs", "The Cotter's Saturday Night", "To a Mouse", etc. New poems included Death and Doctor Hornbrook, The Brigs of Ayr, The Holy Fair, John Barleycorn, Address to the Unco Guid, or the Rigidly Righteous and significantly To a Haggis (often given elsewhere as Address to a Haggis). Of the seven new songs Green grows the Rashes. A Fragment is an example of Burns's gift for re-working traditional folk-verse.
The sequence of the contents is also slightly different with the dedication followed by the contents, then the subscribers list followed by the poems and songs and finally the glossary. It is unclear why the subscribers list needed to be printed in the 'London Edition' other than as an indication of the high status of the previous subscribers acting as a stimulus to prospective purchasers of this new edition. The addenda to the subscribers list is absent as the names were incorporated into the alphabetical listing by the printers and it is likely that those who Burns was unable to add to the list for the Edinburgh Edition were added here.
Nearly twice the length of the Kilmarnock Edition of 1786 it was printed in demy octavo format, measuring 8¾" by 5¾" (22.3 x 14.6 cm), untrimmed, had 372 pages, a 38-page subscribers list and the expanded 24-page glossary or 'dictionary' of Scots words for those unfamiliar with the language. It was published in French gray paper 'printers' boards with most copies subsequently being cut and ornately bound once purchased so that uncut copies in the original printer's boards with a cream paper spine and label are exceedingly rare. It is not clear whether or not the 500 or so 'Edinburgh Edition' copies had a new title page inserted bearing the names of Strahan and Cadell as well as Creech. London Editions are often in poor condition.
The 'chain and line' or laid paper used for the text, unlike the 'Edinburgh Edition' with its fleur-de-lis, does not carry a watermark and the portrait of Burns on the frontispiece is also printed on laid rather than the wove paper that was used for the 'Edinburgh Edition'.
Burns added a number of annotations to clarify or enhance the understanding of their works such as with Halloween on page 161 and their notes on the 'Cove of Colean' (Culzean) as the Elfhame or home of the fairies on page 159.
The Stinking Edition
The 'London Edition' is also sometimes confusingly known as the 'Stinking Edition' or 'Stinking Burns' because the original spelling mistake in the partial second inpression of the 'Edinburgh Edition' was used in error for the text of the true 'London Edition'. The origin of this error is because William Smellie had printed a first run of pages as far as the gathering or signature 'Mm' when they discovered that they had insufficient copies to cover all the subscribers and due to a shortage of type they were forced to reset the printing blocks and repeat the run as a partial second impression. In the haste to reset the blocks a large number of mainly minor errors were introduced, the most famous of which is the substitution of a 't' for a 'k' that converted the Scots word 'skinking' (meaning watery) into 'stinking'. This error has resulted in the term Stinking Burns or the Stinking Edition being applied to this rarer impression as well as the 'London Edition', around 1000 out of 3000 copies being so altered.
The other well known error 'Duke of Boxburgh' for 'Duke of Roxburgh' was corrected.
Six of the original holograph manuscript versions of the poems published in the Kilmarnock, Edinburgh, London and later editions are in the possession of the Irvine Burns Club in North Ayrshire, who also possess a copy of the 1786 Kilmarnock Edition and the 1787 Edinburgh Edition.
The publishers
A. Strahan; T. Cadell in the Strand; and W. Creech, Edinburgh were the publishers of the 1787 'London Edition', however the 500 or so 'Second Edition' copies originated from the original subscription by William Creech for 'Edinburgh Editions'. These copies would differ considerably from the true 'London Editions' with a different typeface, various corrections and minor differences in layout, etc. The title page may also differ.
The Portrait of Robert Burns
William Creech commissioned Alexander Nasmyth to paint Burns' portrait from which John Beugo engraved the copper plate required for the printing process. Nasmyth was a landscape painter and was reluctant to take on the work however they met with Burns and they became friends resulting in Nasmyth producing a portrait which they never fully completed due to their concern over spoiling what they had already achieved. John Beugo the engraver arranged several sittings with Burns and produced a better likeness as confirmed by Gilbert Burns. Nasmyth refused payment from Creech and gave the painting to Jean Armour.
An intriguing incident is that Burns had heard that Creech was secretly publishing another edition and to prove this they visited Beugo and asked for the engraved plate used to print the frontispiece portrait. Beugo engraved a 'distinguishing mark' on it and this secret mark subsequently appeared on a large number of copies of the Edinburgh edition and by extension, the first of the 'London Editions'.
Subsequent editions
In 1793 a two volume Second Edinburgh Edition was published, much enlarged and for the first time containing the poem Tam o' Shanter, although It had already appeared in such publications as the second volume of Francis Grose's Antiquities of Scotland, for which it was originally written.
Other 18th century editions are those published in Dublin, Belfast, London and New York, not always with the authors knowledge or with the permission of William Creech, the copyright holder.
Thomas Stewart's 1802 edition is notorious for having included a section with twenty-five letters written by Sylvander Robert Burns to Clarinda Agnes Maclehose without the permission of the copyright holders.
The copyright for the 1787 'Edinburgh Edition' expired in 1801.

Barrow Hill Roundhouse, until 1948 known as Staveley Engine Shed, is a former Midland Railway roundhouse in Barrow Hill, near Staveley and Chesterfield, Derbyshire (), now serving as a railway heritage centre.
History
Staveley Roundhouse was built to a standard Midland Railway square shed design in 1870 with a central turntable undercover. After 1948 it became known as Barrow Hill so as not to confuse it with the ex-Great Central shed nearby. It was operational from 1870 until 9 February 1991.
The last shed supervisor was Pete Hodges and the last person to sign on at Barrow Hill was Joe Denston, for the up sidings preparer. The last locomotives to use the shed on its final day of operation were four diesels: Class 58 no. 58 016 came on shed at 11:00; Class 58 no. 58 027 came on shed at 11:30 and coupled up to 58 016; both Class 58s left for Worksop at 11:40; Class 20 nos. 20 197 and 20 073 arrived on shed at 12:00 and both Class 20 locomotives left for Worksop at 12:10, driven by driver Bob Hill.
Code
Midland Railway: M24
London Midland & Scottish: 18D
British Railways Eastern region: 41E
British Railways: BH (end of steam, 4 October 1965)
Preservation
After closure, the building was heavily vandalised. After lobbying of the local council, the building was Grade II listed by the Department of the Environment in February 1991. Following negotiations with the British Railways Property Board, Chesterfield Borough Council became the new owners of the shed and nearby yard on 20 December 1996.
The council subsequently granted a recurring maintenance lease to the Barrow Hill Engine Shed Society, who secured and refurbished the site, including renewal of the original 1870 roundhouse glass roof, except for one section. Funding was provided by the council, Derbyshire County Council, the Transport Trust, North Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council, European Regional Development Fund and the Government SRB fund. The site reopened to the public in July 1998.
Today, still retaining its connection to the UK national rail network through Network Rail, it is the home to many preserved British railway locomotives. The Harry Needle Railroad Company also store and maintain a number of operational lease locomotives on site. As well as the main roundhouse building, Barrow Hill is also home to the former Pinxton Signal box. Relocated after closure, it has since been refurbished and fitted out as per a typical day in its last year of use for Network Rail.

Wellchester (originally Wellworths) was a retail store in Dorchester, Dorset, England.
History
January 2009 saw the closure of the final 200 Woolworths stores in the UK, including the Dorchester branch. At the time of closure, Claire Robertson was the store manager and after the closure of their branch, they decided to open their own version of the store in the former Woolworths premises BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans officially re-opened the store on 11 March 2009 at 10am.
On 2 April 2009, BBC One aired a documentary entitled How Woolies Became Wellies: One Woman's Fight for the High Street, following Robertson's journey from the closing of Woolworths to the opening of Wellworths.
Weeks after the store opened, the store was the subject of significant media coverage from across Europe. Just three months after the opening of the store, Wellworths celebrated its 100,000th customer. Robertson said that they never expected to get through 100,000 so soon after the store's opening day.
In October 2010 it was revealed that the store would change its name to Wellchester after pressure from Shop Direct Group, owner of the Woolworths brand.
In July 2012, it was announced that the store would be closing in the following month. A closing-down sale went ahead in August, and Poundland applied for planning permission to take over the premises. The Wellchester store finally closed its doors on 18 August.
Legacy
In April 2010 Faith Footwear Ltd went into administration and 70 stores were closed, more than 1700 staff lost their jobs. Inspired by Claire Robertson's success the Chelmsford branch of Faith was reopened by the staff who used to work in the store on 3 July 2010, the new business is called 'Hope'. In the official press release Store Manager Justina Pay stated: "We were inspired by Claire Robertson and their success in turning their old Dorchester Woolworths store into Wellworths, a great example of someone who has had a massive success from a very sad redundancy. Customers were genuine in their sadness that our stores were closing and were concerned as to where they could buy quality shoes from, we knew we had to 'do a Wellworths' and try and bring it back!"

The NZPWI Invitational was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event hosted by the website New Zealand Pro Wrestling Informer (NZPWI). The event was the first interpromotional show ever held in New Zealand and featured wrestlers from the country's three major promotions Impact Pro Wrestling, Kiwi Pro Wrestling, New Zealand Wide Pro Wrestling, and Peter Ball's Major Impact Wrestling from Australia now called Impact Pro Wrestling Australia. Held annually in 2006 and 2007, it was primarily a single-elimination tournament and included a 20-man battle royal semi-main event. The battle royal would end via pin or submission between the last two entrants, the winner of which would receive an entry for next year's invitational.
The event was largely organised by Dion McCraken, NZPWI editor-in-chief, whose intention was to bring attention to professional wrestling in New Zealand. Similar to the Super 8 Tournament in the United States or the Super J-Cup in Japan, it showcased the top talent of New Zealand's "big three" and provided the first major television exposure for many independent wrestlers in the Australasian region since the days of Steve Rickard's "On the Mat" during the 1980s. The show also served as a reunion of sorts for older veterans of the era. John da Silva, a champion amateur and pro wrestler during the 1960s and 70s, was in attendance at the 2006 invitational and presented the trophy to "Heartless" Alfred Valentine after winning the tournament.
It was one of the largest show's ever held in New Zealand and the event received some coverage by the national media. The 2006 NZPWI Invitational was promoted by Fight Times Magazine in March 2006. The Machine, an IPW wrestler and first entrant to battle royal, was featured in a cover story for the Horowhenua-Kapiti Weekend Chronicle on 29 July. Two of its participants, IPW wrestlers Alfred Valentine and Jon E. King, were interviewed on TV One's morning talk show Breakfast by Kay Gregory days prior to the event.
The first annual NZPWI Invitational was held at the Lynfield YMCA on 12 August 2006, and was attended by a sell out crowd of 450 fans. It was the largest attendance for a live wrestling event in 20 years. The 2006 NZPWI Invitational was later shown on Sky 1 and proved so popular that the network aired on primetime the following year. The second show was broadcast following the 9 December 2007 edition of WWE Smackdown, and again on Christmas Eve followed by the WWE Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. The program was watched by over 100,000 people on Sky 1 and both invitationals later released on DVD. Dion McCracken served as the colour commentator for both shows, with co-host Vinny Dunn in 2006 and manager Gary O. Davis in 2007, and their performance led to a full-time position as the head announcer of IPW Ignition.
Although plans were made to hold a third NZPWI Invitational in November 2008, the event was unable to gain the necessary corporate sponsorship to cover costs. Previous shows had been held at a significant loss, costing at least $15,000 to run, and almost entirely supported financially by McCraken himself. Due to the financial burden, as well as familial commitments, McCraken officially announced on NZPWI.co.nz that they would no longer be able to host the event.

Dickson D. Despommier (June 5, 1940) is an emeritus professor of microbiology and Public Health at Columbia University. From 1971 to 2009, they conducted research on intracellular parasitism and taught courses on parasitic diseases, medical ecology and ecology. Despommier has received media coverage for their ideas on vertical farming.
Research
Despommier has research interest in the ecotone, a transition area between two biomes, as a zone of high disease transmission and also in the spread of schistosomiasis, malaria, and a variety of helminths (ascaris, hookworm, trichuris) in agricultural areas. Despommier has studied the ecology of West Nile virus with a focus on related patterns of weather.
Research and findings on Trichinella spiralis, the causative agent of trichinosis, have resulted in a large body of literature. Despommier is especially known for their research findings in this area which led to numerous advances in the understanding of the "muscle stage" of the organism, and how it maintains itself in the host for long periods of time in the Nurse cell/parasite complex (weeks to years in some cases).
They developed their concept of vertical farming over a 10-year period with graduate students in a medical ecology class beginning in 1999, with work continued by designer Chris Jacobs and Ontarian eco-architect Gordon Graff from the University of Waterloo's School of Architecture.
Science outreaches to the public
In June 2008 Despommier appeared on the "Colbert Report", where they described the concept of vertical farming to Stephen Colbert.
 They are a regular panel-member of the podcast This Week in Virology, produced by their colleague Vincent Racaniello.
Books
Despommier has authored or co-authored ten books:

Laura Ashley (née Mountney; 7 September 1925 – 17 September 1985) was a Welsh fashion designer and business person. They originally made furnishing materials in the 1950s, expanding the business into clothing design and manufacture in the 1960s. The Laura Ashley style is characterised by Romantic designs – often with a 19th-century rural feel – and the use of natural fabrics.
Early life
Ashley was born at their grandmother's home, 31 Station Terrace, Dowlais, Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. They were raised in a civil service family as a Strict Baptist. The chapel they attended in Dowlais (Hebron) was Welsh language and although they could not understand it, they loved it, especially the singing. Educated at Marshall's School in Merthyr Tydfil until 1932, they were then sent to the Elmwood School, Croydon. They were evacuated back to Wales aged 13, but with so many World War II evacuees there were no school places left and they attended Aberdare Secretarial School.
In 1942, at age 16, they left school and served in the Women's Royal Naval Service. During this period they met engineer Bernard Ashley at a youth club in Wallington. After the war, Bernard was posted to India with the Gurkhas, and the pair corresponded by letter. From 1945 to 1952, they worked as a secretary for the National Federation of Women's Institutes in London, marrying Bernard in 1949.
The company
While working as a secretary and raising their first two children, Ashley undertook some development work for the Women's Institute on quilting. Revisiting the craft they had learnt with their grandmother, they began designing headscarves, napkins, table mats and tea-towels which Bernard printed on a machine they had designed in their attic flat at 83 Cambridge Street, Pimlico, London.
The couple had invested £10 in wood for the screen frame, dyes and a few yards of linen. Ashley's inspiration to start producing printed fabric came from a Women's Institute display of traditional handicrafts at the Victoria & Albert Museum. When Ashley looked for small patches carrying Victorian designs to help them make patchworks, they found no such thing existed. Here was an opportunity, and they started to print Victorian style headscarves in 1953.
The scarves quickly became successful – retailing both via mail order and at high street chains such as John Lewis – and Bernard left their City job to print fabrics full-time. The company was originally registered as Ashley Mountney (Laura's maiden name), but Bernard changed the name to Laura Ashley because they felt a woman's name was more appropriate for the type of products they were producing. The new company moved to Kent in 1955, but when the third of their four children was born, the family moved to Wales in 1960.
Laura Ashley's first shop was opened at 35 Maengwyn Street, Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, in 1961. The Laura Ashley association is commemorated by a small plaque. The shop sold locally produced honey and walking sticks as well as the couple's own products. Here Laura worked with a seamstress to introduce their first forays into fashion, producing smock like shirts and gardening smocks. The family lived above the shop until moving to Carno, Montgomeryshire. They first set up in the vacant social club, but moved in 1967 to the local railway station, which had been closed two years earlier.
Personal life
Laura and Bernard Ashley had four children who were all involved with the business. David (born 1954/55), the eldest son, designed the shops; one of the daughters, Jane, was the company photographer; another daughter, Emma, and their second son, Nick, were part of the company's fashion design team. Bernard was the company chairperson and Laura kept a close eye on fabrics. The success of the business meant that the Ashleys could afford a yacht, a private plane, the French Château de Remaisnil in Picardy, a town-house in Brussels, and the villa Contenta in Lyford Cay, New Providence, Bahamas, later purchased for $8.5 million by T. J. Maloney.
Death
In 1985, just after their 60th birthday, Laura Ashley fell down the stairs of their daughter's home in the West Midlands and was taken to hospital in Coventry, where they died ten days later of a brain haemorrhage.  They are buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist, in Carno, Wales.
Legacy
Two months after their death in 1985, Laura Ashley Holdings went public in a flotation that was 34 times oversubscribed. A memorial plaque to Laura Ashley, at the family's former home 83 Cambridge Street, Pimlico was unveiled on 5 July 1994.
Sir Bernard Ashley died of cancer on 14 February 2009.
Foundation
The Laura Ashley Foundation was set up in 1987; as the running of the Foundation has been taken over by Bernard and Laura's children, the strategy has evolved from purely funding the arts to also funding broader community and social welfare projects. It was this evolution that prompted the change of name in 2011 from The Laura Ashley Foundation to The Ashley Family Foundation.

In sailing, gaskets are lengths of rope or fabric used for reefing a sail, or hold a stowed sail in place. In modern use, the term is usually restricted to square-rigged ships, the equivalent items on yachts being referred to by the more prosaic "sail ties".
On most ships, gaskets are made of rope. They are attached to the top of the yard and, left loose, would hang behind the sail. Gaskets should never be left dangling, however, so when the sail is set they are brought around underneath the yard and up the back of it and then tied to the jackstay (metal rod) where they originated. Alternatively, longer gaskets - particularly the clew gaskets described below - can be secured using a gasket coil. When the sail is to be stowed it is first folded and bagged neatly within itself, pulled onto the top of the yard, and then the gaskets are brought round over it and secured to the jackstay to hold it in place. Gaskets should be tied with a slippery hitch to enable them to be let off quickly, though if the yard is large there may only be enough rope to form a clove hitch when the gasket is brought round it.
Most ships are equipped with clew gaskets at the outer ends of the yards. These do not pass around the sail, but through a shackle or ring on the blocks of the sheet. Pulled tight and secured to the jackstay or the yard's lift, this takes the load off the clewline and sail, and should allow the blocks to be lifted higher, dragging the sail down less and enabling a neater stow.

Sally Sloane (3 October 1894 – 20 September 1982) (birth name Eunice Evelyn Frost) was possibly the most important Australian "source musician" (carrier of Australian-Irish traditional music and song) to have been recorded during the Australian folk music revival of the 1950s and onwards; a number of their songs and tunes were passed down via their mother from their Irish grandmother, who emigrated to Australia in 1838. A resident of Lithgow, New South Wales and in their 60s at the time of their "discovery" by Australian folklorist John Meredith in 1954, they were an accomplished player of button accordion, fiddle and mouth organ as well as a singer. On a number of visits over the period 1954–1960, Meredith recorded over 150 items from her; these recordings are now in the collection of the National Library of Australia, and transcriptions of almost 40 of them were included, with accompanying notes, in their seminal 1967 book (with Hugh Anderson) "Folk Songs of Australia; And the Men and Women Who Sang Them". They were also visited and recorded by other collectors and at least one LP recording of their singing, "A Garland For Sally", was released, by Warren Fahey's Larrikin Records.
Biography
Sally was born in 1894 at Parkes, New South Wales to Sarah and Tom Frost (a coach driver for Cobb and Co) and was christened Eunice Evelyn Frost. Together, Sally and their twin sister Bertha were the youngest of 10 children born to their parents over a fourteen-year period. It is not known when they began to be called "Sally", however the name is a diminutive of Sarah, which was the name of both their mother and grandmother.
Sally's maternal grandmother, Sarah Alexander, who died in 1889, was born in County Kerry in Ireland, and came to Australia by sailing ship with their brother when they were 22 years old. According to Sally's later conversations with John Meredith, their grandmother was a trained singer who knew many songs and dance tunes, many of which were later passed down to Sally via their daughter (Sally's mother), and entertained the passengers on their voyage out during concert parties. After their arrival in Australia, Sarah Alexander married a man called Dick Burrowes, and after their death, Charles Dean; their first daughter, also called Sarah (Sally's mother) initially married Tom Frost, Sally's father as described above, before divorcing them to take up residence with William Clegg, an itinerant railway construction worker and former gold miner. Sally and their twin sister, Bertha, travelled with their mother and new stepfather around the railway camps, adopting the surname of Clegg which they used on subsequent official documents. While travelling with their mother and stepfather, Sally found they had the ability to learn songs and tunes easily and later said that, as well as from their mother, they learned songs from their stepfather and from others in Parkes, Aberdeen, Tambar Springs, and elsewhere. In 1911, aged 17, they married John Phillip Malycha, who by then went by the surname of Mountford, a 28 year old miner living at Ashley, near Moree, giving their name as Eunice Evelyn "Mary" Clegg. Sally (Eunice/"Mary") and John lived at a number of locations in New South Wales and had five children within the first six years of their marriage.
It is not recorded what eventually happened to this marriage but it was certainly over by 1947, by which time Sally had formed a new relationship and was included in the New South Wales electoral roll as living in Lithgow, as Eunice Sloane, with Frederick Cecil ("Fred") Sloane, a grinder. Fred and Sally never married but presented themselves as husband and wife and remained together for over 35 years until Fred's death in 1980. The couple lived in Lithgow until 1956, when they moved first to Fennells Bay and then to Teralba, on the shore of Lake Macquarie, where Fred had work. In 1966, Fred's work there was complete and the couple returned to Lithgow, where they remained until Fred's death. Subsequently, Sally moved to Albury to stay with a niece, Jean, but unfortunately died following a tragic caravan fire on the property in which they were badly burned, at the age of 87.
A reminiscence of Sally was included in an interview with their granddaughter, Cheryl Wotton (b. 1949), interviewed by Valda and Jim Low in 2001. A photograph with the caption "Sally Sloan presiding over a birthday party, Lithgow circa 1943", also including an image of their mother (known as "Granny Clegg"), was published in the Bush Music Club online archive in 2020.
Musical activities, repertoire and style
Sally's mother Sarah was musical, playing concertina, button accordion, jew's harp and piano, and sang many songs from the repertoire of their own mother. Sally inherited their mother's love of music, playing the instruments favoured by their mother as well as becoming an accomplished player on the fiddle, mouth organ and tin whistle. While still a youngster they were already playing for bush dances and sang at local gatherings. Sally also mentioned (in an interview with Warren Fahey) appearing on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney on at least one occasion during the second world war, playing for soldiers.
In late 1954 (Bush Music Cub archives) or early 1955 (McKenry book), John Meredith was performing in Lithgow with their pioneering "bush band" The Bushwhackers and as was their usual practice on the hunt for "bush singers", enquired whether there were any local singers they could visit. Fred Sloane was one of the organisers for the concert and told Meredith that their wife had a huge store of songs and tunes and could sing them "until the cows come home"; Meredith at first was inclined to disbelieve this but another of the group, Alan Scott was billeted with the Sloanes that weekend and confirmed the truth of Fred's assertion. Meredith lost no time in paying the Sloanes a visit on the next available occasion and returned numerous times, eventually recording over 150 items from their repertoire. A number of these were later released on the 1983 Larrikin Records LP, "A Garland For Sally", while a larger set of songs and tunes were included in Meredith and Hugh Anderson's 1967 publication "Folk Songs of Australia; And the Men and Women Who Sang Them." Meredith and the Sloanes enjoyed a close friendship, with Sally frequently contacting Meredith to tell them that they had remembered another song, or fragment thereof, with the result that Meredith visited the Sloanes on no less than 60 occasions; at one stage they were making the journey up to Lithgow (and later Teralba) every second month.
Meredith included Sally (as "Mrs. F. Sloane") as one of the "true Australian tradition-bearers" at the inaugural Australian Folklore Festival, staged in Sydney in September 1955. They were also (re-) recorded performing 8 items (songs and tunes) for a 1957 Wattle Records release Australian Traditional Singers and Musicians, along with other musicians originally recorded by Meredith including Duke Tritton, Herbert Gimbert and Edwin Goodwin - only the last using Meredith's original recording, since the singer had subsequently died. Reviewing this release in Midwest Folklore in 1959, the eminent U.S. folklorist Kenneth S. Goldstein wrote: "Mrs. Sloan[e] is one of the great traditional singers of the world, certainly comparing favorably with the best to be offered in the English-speaking nations. And Mrs. Sloane's renditions on the button accordion and mouth organ are as delightful as their singing."
Sally was visited over the years by several other collectors including Warren Fahey and Graham Seal, Emily Lyle and Chris Sullivan, from the 1950s until the late 1970s. Former Bushwhacker and mouth organ player Harry Kay noted two Schottisches from them on a visit to them in Sydney in around 1968, while recordings made by Warren Fahey in 1976 are held in the National Library of Australia's Oral History and Folklore Collection.
Sally's performance style and repertoire, strongly influenced by the songs they learned orally, passed down by their Irish grandmother and mother, included original Irish ballads, English and Scottish traditional songs, bush ballads, and popular songs from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that they learned from other musicians. Them Australian repertoire included such songs as "The Springtime it Brings on the Shearing", "The Wallaby Track", Henry Lawson's "Ballad of the Drover", "Click Go the Shears", and bushranger songs such as "The Death of Ben Hall" and "John Doolin", their version of "The Wild Colonial Boy"; it was songs like these (and bush instrumentals) that first attracted Meredith to Sally as an informant, however the survival of unique versions of Irish and British songs from the mid nineteenth century repertoire of their Irish grandmother can be viewed as equally if not more important from a folkloristic perspective.
Graeme Smith described their singing style in the following manner:
John Meredith, in their introduction to "The Sally Sloane Songbook" (see below), wrote:
A selection from Sally's repertoire was published posthumously as "The Sally Sloane Songbook" (Scott, 2004; for details see Bibliography). A listing of c. 144 items (songs and tunes) collected by John Meredith from Sally is given as an "extra" to the account of their life prepared by Valda Low, a more detailed list (with links) of tunes only was prepared by Ian Hayden in 2016, while Warren Fahey has put online a separate list of items of Sally's that they recorded.
They were made one of the earliest life members of the Sydney Bush Music Club, formed in 1954, and performed there on numerous occasions.

The Royal Palm is a breed of domestic turkey. It is not primarily selected for meat production, and is usually kept as an ornamental bird with a unique appearance, largely white with bands of metallic black.
The Royal Palm first appeared in the 1920s on a farm in Lake Worth, Florida, apparently as a cross between Black, Bronze, Narragansett, and native turkeys. Years of selective breeding followed to stabilize the coloring, and the Royal Palm was finally accepted by the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection in 1971. In Europe, a turkey with similar coloration is sometimes called the Cröllwitzer, Pied, or Black-laced White.
Most heritage turkey breeds declined after the adoption of the Broad Breasted White by the turkey industry; the Royal Palm is an endangered breed and is classified as "watch" by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy. It is also included in Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste, a catalog of heritage foods in danger of extinction. The Australian and United States both report the breed as endangered to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

The 1975–76 Gillette Cup was the second edition of what is now the Regional Super50, the domestic limited-overs cricket competition for the countries of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). Sponsored by Gillette, it was the first season of the competition to carry that name.
Six teams participated – Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Windward Islands. The competition was impacted by rain, with only three of the six scheduled group-stage matches being completed. Barbados were eventually joined by Trinidad and Tobago in the final, going on to defeat their opponent by 43 runs to claim their second domestic one-day title. Two Barbadians, Gordon Greenidge and Wayne Daniel, led the tournament in runs and wickets, respectively.

Ouenza () is a town in Tébessa Province, in far eastern Algeria; near the border with Tunisia; 43 km south of Souk Ahras; and west of M'Daourouch.
Demographics
The population is 52,000. Ethnologically, the city draws its population from the diverse surrounding regions, including Souk Ahras, Taoura, Annaba, Guelma, Tebessa, Chréa, El-meridj, Ain Zerga, Meskiana and others.
Life in Ouenza
Ouenza was built by the French Société de l'Ouenza at the start of the Twentieth Century, to exploit the iron ore deposits that have been the basis of economic growth in the region for over 100 years. Originally, workers from Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and other regions of Algeria came to Ouenza, contributing to its cultural diversity and making the town unique in the region. But once these workers retired and returned home with their families, they were replaced by inhabitants of Ouenza's neighbouring villages.
Ouenza's location brings it a dry climate, with hot summers and cold winters. The majority of the inhabitants leave for coastal towns such as Annaba and el Kala during the summer season.
Ouenza has a number of locations very popular with its inhabitants. One of these, the suq, is known by its colonial name, SAS. People of all ages gather at the boulodrome, named "le Cercle", to watch the game of pétanque. The main supermarket is named "L'économat". There is also a village hall with a 400-seat cinema and air conditioning. There are also three tennis courts and the football field of the local team OSO. Recently a number of cybercafes have emerged, catering for the tastes of the young people.
Mining and its ecological impact
The transportation of iron ore raises clouds of dust throughout the city, making hygienic life difficult and discoloring paintwork. Locals also suffer a number of lung complaints from inhalation of the dust, particularly silicosis. After years of exposure, most of Ouenza's miners eventually suffer from this affliction, caused by inhaling silica dust, and many die from its complications.

Mathilde Jacob (8 March 1873 – 14 April 1943) was a German typist and translator who during the First World War became politically involved, working with the anti-war Spartacus League and as a founder member of the German Communist Party. They came to politics through their work for Rosa Luxemburg, whose friend and close confidant they became. Although Mathilde Jacob continued to be politically engaged in the 1920s, their greater contribution to history comes from them having smuggled Luxemburg's letters and documents out of Luxemburg's prison cell during their friend's various incarcerations during the 1914–1918 war. They then preserved much of Luxemburg's written legacy after the latter's murder.
By the time the Nazis took power early in 1933 Mathilde Jacob had for most purposes retired into obscurity, but their personal history of communist activism and their Jewishness nevertheless made them vulnerable. It is thought that they attempted to escape from Germany in 1936 but without success. In 1939 they did succeed in transferring some of the letters written to and by Rosa Luxemburg to the United States. They died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, having been arrested and deported at the end of July 1942. Following Jacob's death, the authorities attending to their confiscated assets recorded a claim from their landlord that they were liable to pay for some repairs on their apartment, also noting that rent on the property had not been received for three months.
Life
Provenance and early years
Mathilde Jacob was born in Berlin. They were the eldest child of Julius and Emilie Jacob who ran a small meat wholesale business. In 1907 they set themselves up as a freelance typist and translator in the Berlin-Moabit quarter. In their little agency they at times employed an assistant, and at one stage they took on a trainee. Clients for whom they typed up manuscripts included the political radicals Julian Marchlewski, Franz Mehring and, from 1913, the influential philosopher Rosa Luxemburg. Jacob was deeply impressed by Luxemburg, and became supportive of the anti-militarist campaign in which Luxemburg was engaged.  They are described in sources as having become Luxemburg's reliable confidant, and in practical terms was able to be particularly helpful during Luxemburg's various periods in prison, looking after their friend's apartment and attending to Mimi, the cat, who died while Luxemburg was away in prison. It is also clear that Luxemburg, who had not been convicted but for much or all of this time was simply being detained in "protective custody" was able to receive visitors and was not prevented from writing copiously while they were in prison. Jacob was able to smuggle several important manuscripts out of the jail, including the "Spartacus letters" ("news sheets") and the "Junius" pamphlet, Luxemburg's important critique of the crisis unfolding in the Social Democratic Party, in the wake of the party leadership's decision to agree what amounted to a parliamentary truce, notably on matters involving funding for the war, for its duration. However, although the Junius pamphlet subsequently became something of an iconic document, at the time it proved impossible to find a publisher for it till after Luxemburg's (temporary) release from prison in 1916. From 1917 Mathilde Jacobs also worked intensively with Luxemburg's political associate Leo Jogiches: their collaboration lasted well into the revolutionary period that Germany experienced directly after the war. Jacobs was certainly present at the three day party congress that started on 30 December 1918 which marked the foundation of the Communist Party of Germany. It is likely that they participated actively in it.
Revolution and leadership killings
During the weeks following the creation of the Communist Party, Berlin saw a new wave of revolutionary violence, which the communist leaders, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, declined to disown. With the savage aftermath the Russian Revolution still fresh in the minds of all concerned, the new German government ordered the immediate destruction of the left-wing uprising: the implementation of this instruction involved the killings by a Freikorps cavalry unit, on 15 January 1919, of both Luxemburg and Liebknecht. Luxemburg's body was thrown into a canal. Not quite five months later, early in June 1919, a body believed to be Rosa Luxemburg's was recovered. Mathilde Jacob and Luxemburg's friend, Wanda Marcusson, were summoned to corroborate its identification, which they did, largely on the basis of the dress and blue medallion accompanying the badly decomposed corpse. (The identification of the corpse remains contentious.) In the immediate aftermath of the killings, Mathilde Jacob, who seemed to be under less immediate threat than some of the more fiery comrades, assumed responsibility for the finances of the new party. However, they themselves was arrested and detained between June and September 1919.
More party splits
Jacob was badly affected by Luxemburg's killing, which was followed, in March 1919, by the assassination of Leo Jogiches. On their release from detention in September 1919 they moved to Stuttgart and joined up with Clara Zetkin, with whom they worked on the editorial content of the magazine "Kommunistin" ("[female] Communist"). They also worked closely with Paul Levi who took over the party leadership in March 1919, and whose political outlook they shared. However, the party split in 1921 after Levy spoke out against the violent tactics employed in the March insurrection in central Germany. It turned out that their view of the matter was not widely shared among leading party comrades, and it was Levi who left the Communist Party of Germany, founding the Kommunistische Arbeitergemeinschaft / KAG) ("Communist Workers' Community"). Jacob went with him. During 1921/1922 they edited the KAG newspaper, "Unser Weg" ("Our way"). Later they also contributed to "Sozialistische Politik und Wirtschaft" (SPW / "Sozialistische Politik und Wirtschaft"), a periodical produced by Levi himself. In 1922 they were among those, with Levy, who briefly rejoined the Independent Social Democratic Party (" Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands" / USPD) from which the Communist Party had drawn many of its founding members three years earlier. By September 1922 the USPD and the SPD were collaborating well in the Reichstag and the decision was taken to merge them, thus reversing a split that had taken place in 1917. As a result of all this, Mathilde Jacob now found themselves a member of the Social Democratic Party ("Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands" / SPD). In 1922 they reopened their little typing and translation agency in Berlin.
They continued to support Paul Levi with the production of various political publications, such as the newspaper "Unser Weg" ("Our way"). After Levi died, in 1930, they withdrew from political activities, although after 1933 they did maintain contacts with opposition circles. Through the 1920s they are, for the most part, content to remain in the background. An exception arose in the summer of 1921. The seventh party conference, held at Jena in August 1921, turned its attention to a project to publish the writings of Rosa Luxemburg, a much revered figure within the party whose status, following their killing, remained undiminished. A party official subsequently committed certain practical concerns to paper, however, suggesting that the project would most likely come to nothing because Luxemburg's papers were in the hands of "a spinster, who following a breach of party discipline, no longer belongs to the party". The official was casting doubt on whether Rosa Luxemburg's papers would be handed over to the party. Jacob's reaction, which came in the form of a letter published in the USPD newspaper, "Freiheit", was both revealing and withering.
Final years
The Nazis took power at the start of 1933. Mathilde Jacob was subjected to the same repression and restrictions as everyone else identified as Jewish. They survived on a small pension and with small writing assignments. They were taken away on 27 July 1942 and deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. For many years it was known that they died there, but it is only recently, following the discovery and review in Israel of some records recovered from Theresienstadt, that their precise death date, 14 April 1943, was identified.

The Hundredth Chance is a 1920 British silent drama film directed by Maurice Elvey and starring Dennis Neilson-Terry, Mary Glynne, and Eille Norwood. It was based on the 1917 novel The Hundredth Chance by Ethel M. Dell. It is not known whether the film currently survives, which suggests that it is a lost film.
Plot
As summarized in a film publication, Jack Bolton (Seaward) is the genius of the racing stable of Lord Saltash. They fall in love with Maud Brian (Glynne), daughter of Lady Bernard Brian (Lascelles), who is married to the innkeeper Giles Sheppard (Arundell). While Maud knows Jack is in love with her, they are half in love with Lord Saltash (Neilson-Terry) and does not love Jack. However, Lord Saltash's cruelty to their crippled brother Bunny (Key) makes them hesitate. They contemplate marrying Jack to protect their brother. Jack then takes the "hundredth chance" and asks Maud to marry him, hoping their love will come later. After Maud marries Jack, Lord Saltash desires their trainer's new wife and traps them in their castle and tries to compromise them That same day Saltash's horse named The Hundredth Chance wins a big race and Jack wins a fortune. That day Jack also wins their wife's love after their trust in them despite the apparently damning circumstances created by Lord Saltash. Maud, who had been wife in name only, becomes Jim's wife in fact.

The Victorian Wader Study Group (VWSG) is an Australian non-profit, volunteer, ornithological fieldwork group that gathers biometric and other data on waders and terns, mainly through regular catches of large samples of several species by cannon-netting at sites along the coast of Victoria.
History
The origins of the VWSG go back to 1975 when Dr David Robertson and others started mist-netting waders at night. The first place they tried was in the Cheetham Salt Works at Altona, though better results were obtained later at a coastal site adjacent to the Werribee Sewage Farm, near the town of Werribee, 30 km south-west of Melbourne on Port Phillip.
In 1978 the group was joined by Dr Clive Minton, who had been a pioneer in the development of cannon-netting in Britain as a means of catching large numbers of waders and waterfowl for banding and demographic studies. Minton introduced the technique to the group, with the first cannon-net catch being made at Werribee on 31 December 1978. Thereafter, although the group continued to use mist-netting occasionally for a few years, cannon-netting became the principal method used for catching waders.
At first operating under the aegis of the Victorian Ornithological Research Group, the VWSG was formally established as an independent body in 1979, with David Robertson and Clive Minton elected as co-convenors. Since 1981 it has had a close relationship with the Australasian Wader Studies Group (AWSG), a special interest group of Birds Australia. The VWSG was incorporated in Victoria in 1987. The group's mission is to " …gather, through extensive planned fieldwork programs, comprehensive data on waders and terns throughout Victoria on a long-term basis. This scientifically collected information is intended to form a factual base for conservation considerations, to be a source of information for education of a wider audience, to be a means of generating interest of the general community in environmental and conservation issues, and so be a major contribution to Australian, Flyway and Worldwide knowledge of waders and terns." The VWSG has a membership of about 150, mainly based in Melbourne, and publishes an annual bulletin. As well as conducting fieldwork, it has constructed cannon-nets for, and lent equipment to, other organisations in Australia to encourage more widespread research on waders. It also assists government agencies monitoring migratory birds as potential disease vectors for avian influenza.
Fieldwork
As well as Werribee, a site which has become relatively less important over the years, the principal regular fieldwork areas of the VWSG include Swan Bay, Western Port, Anderson Inlet and Corner Inlet. Annual visits are made to Mud Islands in Port Phillip, south-eastern South Australia and King Island, Tasmania, as well as occasionally elsewhere. VWSG equipment and members usually form the core of the almost annual expeditions of the AWSG to north-west Western Australia.
The average number of cannon-netting catches made by the VWSG is over 40 a year, with an average annual total of over 7000 waders processed. Principal species caught are red-necked stint, curlew sandpiper, sharp-tailed sandpiper, red knot, sanderling, double-banded plover, bar-tailed godwit, ruddy turnstone, pied oystercatcher and sooty oystercatcher. The main tern species studied are crested and Caspian terns, with other species studied opportunistically.
Conservation
Victoria lies at the southern end of the East Asian - Australasian Flyway, and the migratory waders that visit its shores breed in northern Asia and Alaska, passing through the densely populated and rapidly developing regions of eastern and south-eastern Asia on their journeys twice a year. Over the years the VWSG has been operating, the emphasis of fieldwork has evolved from simply obtaining biometric and moult data to understand the biology of the birds, to obtaining information on breeding success and survival rates to understand and monitor population levels in the flyway. Most migratory waders caught by the VWSG are fitted with colour-coded plastic leg-flags in a flyway-based program to determine the exact routes and staging areas used by the birds on migration. The group is also assisting with the satellite tracking of larger waders.

The Capitals–Islanders rivalry is a National Hockey League (NHL) rivalry between the Washington Capitals and the New York Islanders. Both teams compete in the NHL's Eastern Conference's Metropolitan Division. The two teams were fierce rivals mainly during the 1980s and early 1990s, although tensions have flared once more in the late 2010s and early 2020s.
History
1980s
In 1983, the two teams met in the playoffs for the first time ever. The Islanders were the three-time defending Stanley Cup champions while the Capitals were in the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. The Islanders won the series three games to one on their way to their fourth straight Stanley Cup. The next year, the two teams met again, this time they were evenly matched as the Capitals finished second in the division with 101 points, three points back of the first place Islanders. The Islanders were nearly eliminated in the opening round by their crosstown rivals, the New York Rangers, before Ken Morrow scored the overtime winner in the fifth and deciding game. Meanwhile, the Capitals had a much easier first round as they swept the Philadelphia Flyers in three straight games. Washington won the opener by a score of 3–2, but the Islanders won the next four games to take the series in five on their way to the Stanley Cup Final, where they lost to the Edmonton Oilers in five games. In 1985, the Islanders became the first NHL team to comeback from a 0–2 deficit in a best-of-5 series against the Capitals. In 1986, the Capitals were finally victorious over the Islanders in the playoffs, having their best regular season in franchise history (until 2009), winning 50 games and recorded 107 points, swept the Islanders in three straight games for their first ever playoff series win over the Islanders.
In 1987, the teams had one of the most memorable playoff series in NHL history. The Capitals won game one by a score of 4–3, before the Islanders won the next game 3–1 to tie the series at one win each. When the series shifted to New York, the Capitals took control winning the next two games by scores of 2–0 and 4–1 to take a 3–1 series lead. Luckily for the Islanders, the opening round of the playoffs was expanded to a best-of-seven. The Islanders won game 5 in Washington by a score of 4–2 and game 6 at home 5–4, sending the series back to the Capital Centre for the seventh and deciding game. In Game 7, the Capitals jumped out to a 1–0 lead near the end of the first period on a goal by Mike Gartner. In the second, New York got on the board when Patrick Flatley scored at 11:39 to tie the game at 1. Late in the period, Grant Martin scored to give the Capitals a 2–1 lead after two periods of play. Then, at 14:37 of the third period, Bryan Trottier scored to tie the game at 2. No one in attendance at the Cap Centre or watching at home on TV knew it yet, but the game had not yet reached its halfway point. In overtime, the two goaltenders, Kelly Hrudey for the Islanders and Bob Mason for Washington went at it save for save, stopping every scoring chance the other team had. Finally, after three scoreless overtimes, Pat LaFontaine scored the winner at 8:47 of the fourth overtime period, giving the Islanders a 3–2 victory and a 4–3 series win in a game known as the Easter Epic.
1990s
Six years later in 1993, the teams met once again, the Capitals finished second in the division with 93 points, six points ahead of the Islanders. Washington won the opener by a score of 3–1, before the Islanders won the next three games, all in overtime, including two in double OT to take a 3–1 series lead. Washington won game five to stave off elimination, but in game 6, the Islanders won 5–3 to take the series in 6. However, the win was marred as Pierre Turgeon suffered a shoulder injury of a vicious check by Washington's Dale Hunter after scoring a goal to clinch the game and series for Islanders. Consequently, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the 1993–94 season.
2010s
Both teams met in the 2015 Eastern Conference First Round, with Washington winning the series 4–3. Since this series, the rivalry has been fiercely reignited, showing through the remainder of the 2010s into the 2020s.
The rivalry became intense in the 2018–19 season. After the Capitals won the 2018 Stanley Cup, coach Barry Trotz signed with the Islanders, and Capitals' assistant coach Todd Reirden became the team's head coach.
2020s
The two teams met again in the playoffs in the 2020 Eastern Conference First Round, where the Islanders won the series 4–1. After this series, Capitals head coach Todd Reirden was fired.

Littledean Hall () is a country house in the village of Littledean, Gloucestershire, England. It has been described as one of the most haunted houses in England and is thought to be the oldest house in the United Kingdom which is still occupied. Saxon and Celtic remains have been uncovered in the cellars. Part of the house is designated an SSSI as it is a proven breeding roost for the Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum).
Architecture and History
Originally a Saxon hall, then a church, it was then converted to a Norman hall, complete with a crypt and undercroft. Testing has shown that these remains date back to the 5th century. However, when records began of the house in 1080, it had evolved into a substantial medieval manor house which was eventually replaced with a Jacobean house in 1612.
The hall has seven bedrooms, a coach house, a dining room, sitting and drawing rooms, a stable, living room and cellar. The sweet chestnuts (Castanea sativa) which line the driveway are at least 500 years old and the remains of a Roman road have been found underneath the drive itself.
In 2007 the building suffered damage after lightning struck nearby and in 2008 the owners of the hall were ordered to rebuild a section of wall they had knocked down. The wall was deemed to be a Grade II listed building alongside the main hall.
Reports of hauntings
There are at least three distinct tales which have been said to have led to hauntings at Littledean Hall. The first being the deaths of Colonel Congreve and Colonel Wigmore, who both died when the Kings garrison met with roundheads in the dining room. It is reported that visitors can still see the bloodstains where they fell.
In 1741 Charles Pyrke, former occupant of the house, was accused of raping the sister of their servant. The servant promptly murdered Pyrke before being put to death himself. The servant's ghost is thought by some to haunt the hall to this day and it has been reported to be carrying a candle. Two other Pyrke brothers are said to wander the halls, having killed each other in a duel in 1740.
Dean Hall Coach House & Cellar SSSI
Dean Hall Coach House & Cellar () is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in Gloucestershire, notified in 1988. The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).
The hall (coach house and cellar) is currently home to Greater horseshoe bats which makes it a Site of Special Scientific Interest which is closely monitored by Natural England. It is a significant breeding roost and its use has been recorded since 1986. Local reports indicated that bats may have used the building for over 75 years.
Location and habitat
The site is one of a series of Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the Forest of Dean and Wye Valley (Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire). These sites support (between them) breeding and hibernation roosts for Lesser and Greater horseshoe bats. This is of European importance. Other sites in the group in Gloucestershire (all of which are SSSIs) include the breeding sites of Blaisdon Hall, Caerwood And Ashberry Goose House, and Sylvan House Barn. Hibernation sites include Buckshraft Mine & Bradley Hill Railway Tunnel, Devil's Chapel Scowles, Old Bow And Old Ham Mines and Westbury Brook Ironstone Mine.
The deciduous woodlands and sheltered valleys of the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley provide a good feeding area, and the underground systems provide roosting and breeding sites. A ring of iron-ore bearing Carboniferous Limestone in the Forest of Dean has created a series of ancient and more recent mines which provide hibernation sites. The citations for the series of sites provide common information.
Wye Valley and Forest of Dean Bat Sites/ Safleoedd Ystlumod Dyffryn Gwy a Fforest y Ddena are recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive.

HOTA is an acronym for Home Office Type Approval, a testing and certification process by the Home Office in the United Kingdom that speed cameras must pass before evidence from them can be admissible in UK courts by way of certification in accordance with Section 20 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 (RTOA) (Amended by the Road Traffic Act 1991). It is a misconception that speed enforcement devices must be Home Office Type Approved before they may be deployed on public roads to gather evidence of speeding offences however if the device does not have UK Type Approval then the evidence from the device is not able to be certified but must be adduced by a witness and perhaps an expert witness who is able to adduce evidence of its accuracy. The Road Traffic Offenders Act routes via Section 20 certification is a clear advantage over the unapproved equipment route to court.
The Type Approval of devices that meet the definitions or more accurately "prescriptions" of types of devices in Statutory Instruments (forms of secondary legislation) is administered by the Home Office Road Crimes Section with the scientific scrutiny now performed by The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) in conjunction with accredited technical laboratories. The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) oversee a secretariat who coordinate police and laboratory testing of equipment in the process.
Only when DSTL scrutiny, laboratory testing and road testing is completed, and the equipment fully meets the specifications in the relevant Home Office Speedmeter Handbook will the equipment be recommended to the Secretary of State to be awarded UK Type Approval. Once recommended an administrative process takes place between the Home Office and the UK manufacturer or distributing agent in which a contract (Type Approval Agreement) is exchanged and agreed between both parties. When that contract is signed then a Type Approval Certificate is signed by a minister at the Home Office; the equipment can then be used to produce certifiable evidence, evidence of speeding that is admissible in UK courts without the support of a witness. There is no requirement to place the Type Approval Agreement or Certificate of Type Approval before Parliament because the Statutory Instrument defining the "type" of equipment has already been fully ratified by both Houses of Parliament.
The accuracies required to meet HOTA, as laid out in the Speedmeter Handbooks, are agreed internationally. They are not particularly challenging to meet for modern digital equipment however, HOTA requirements extend beyond accuracies; it is often the requirement that an instrument must not cause a violation record to be made when no violation exists that is the most difficult to meet. The Speedmeter Handbooks are freely and openly available to view, they provide guidance to manufacturers and the accredited test laboratories in the general requirements. DSTL and the Home Office may vary the requirements at any time and may adapt them depending upon the equipment that is to be assessed, the Handbooks being "guidance".
Unlike Approval systems in most countries no equipment is Approved without a police input into the testing. Rather than simply testing speed accuracy, the systems are all tested in real traffic situations some of which are created specifically to test a perceived weakness in the systems. Track and real road testing is always conducted so that all kinds of vehicles and traffic situations are used to stimulate the systems. Roadside equipment such as fixed cameras must pass environmental testing before deployment in road testing. The period used for road testing ensures that the systems are tested in all weathers.
If one detection is made that is outside of the accuracy parameters or if one violation record is produced when no violation existed during any test, then the device will fail its Approval until that error is rectified to the satisfaction of the Home Office and DSTL. When rectification is demonstrated testing may recommence.

"After You've Gone" is a 1918 popular song composed by Turner Layton with lyrics by Henry Creamer.
History
It was recorded by Marion Harris on July 22, 1918, and released by Victor Records.
The song became so popular that the sheet music was later decorated with tiny photographs of the 45 men who made the song famous, including Paul Whiteman, Rudy Vallée, B.A. Rolfe, Guy Lombardo, and Louis Armstrong.
Composition
The chorus adheres to a standard ABAC pattern but is only 20 measures long. There are four 4-bar phrases, followed by a 4 measure tag. The song is harmonically active, with chord changes almost every measure. The opening four notes are identical to the opening notes of "Peg o' My Heart" (1912) — at the time songwriters often borrowed the first few notes of a hit melody.

The Battle of Embata was a naval battle fought in 356 BC between the Chians and the Athenians led by Chares.
Battle
The Athenians possessed a fleet of 120 naval vessels while the Chians possessed 100 galleys. This specific naval battle was fought within the straits between the island of Chios and the Anatolian mainland. The arrival of stormy weather compelled Chares's collaborators, Iphicrates and Timotheos (or Timoleon), to abandon the overall expedition. Chares, left with only one-third of their fleet, attacked the Chians and suffered defeat with heavy losses.
Aftermath
On a more specific note, Iphicrates and Timotheos both commanded a supplementary force of 60 naval vessels and joined up with Chares's fleet in the summer of 356 BC. After Chares suffered defeat in the autumn expedition, they ultimately established a lawsuit against both Timotheos and Iphicrates. Timotheos faced impeachment in the aftermath of the lawsuit, which led to their ruination. As a result, Isocrates developed a personal hatred for Chares since Timotheos was one of their closest pupils.

The Federal University of Juiz de Fora (, UFJF) is a public research university in Brazil. Throughout its over 50 years of existence, the university has undergone significant growth, strengthening the quality of undergraduate and graduate education while maintaining its role as an agent of community development.
History
UFJF was established in 1960 by an act of Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitscheck. At that time, colleges functioning in the city of Juiz de Fora were officially integrated by the government to constitute a university. In the earlier years, the courses offered were Medicine, Engineering, Economic Science, Law, Pharmacy and Dentistry. Later, the courses of Geography, Languages & Literature, Philosophy, Biological Sciences, Social Science and History were also opened.
The campus was built in 1969 and the courses offered under licensure were distributed among different campus units. The Social Communication (Journalism) course was created and became part of the Law Faculty departments.
During the 1970s, three institutes were created at the campus: Institute of Exact Sciences (ICE), Institute of Biological Sciences (ICB) and Institute of Human Sciences and Letters (ICHL), offering undergraduate programs. Later, these institutes also offered a range of postgraduate courses and research programs. Recent years have seen significant increases in external research funding, research staff, and graduates from at these University Institutes.
Other research centers were established at the campus: the Biology of Reproduction Center (CBR) in 1971, which works as an animal facility and the Social Research Center (CPS), involved in research subjects such as urbanism, health, employment, culture and education.
The UFJF Historical Archive was founded in 1985 and represents an important source for local, regional and national history research, functioning as a documentation and educational center. Two years later, the UFJF Press was established. Its academic publishing includes journals and books in a wide variety of fields.
In the technology and administrative fields, the Regional Center for Innovation and Transference of Technology (Critt), established in 1995, and the Technology Center-Agrosoft (Núcleo Softex), created in 1996, play a critical role in the regional development of new technologies by teaching and training new professionals. Since the 1990s, the University is also committed to promoting and establishing, with great success, Junior Enterprises specialized in different areas and formed exclusively by undergraduate students. In 2001, a UFJF Junior Enterprise was granted an ISO 9001 Certificate.
In 1999, a new academic unit was established: the Health Sciences Center (CCS), which comprises the School of Medicine, the School of Physiotherapy, the School of Nursing and the School of Dentistry. Several major hospitals are affiliated with the CCS.
In 2006, a new teaching hospital, the Health Care Center (CAS), was built as a resource to improve teaching, research, patient care and public service, increasing the services provided to nearby communities. In the same year, two other units were created: the Arts and Design Institute (IAD) and the Faculty of Languages and Literature.

Colin Craig Hatchman (born 2 February 1975) is an Australian rock musician who joined The Screaming Jets as their drummer during 2001–2004. In 2004 they joined Nathan Cavaleri in Dirty Skanks, Hatchman broke the Guinness Book of World Records as 'Loudest Drummer in the World' on 4 August 2006, the sound was measured at 137.2 dBA.
Career
Hatchman was born in Brisbane and began playing drums in the early 1980s when they were eight years old. They played in marching bands, big bands, metal & punk bands, but found their home with rock bands.
Hatchman played with Brisbane-based band Little Hornet which formed in the early 1990s and moved to Sydney during 1994–1999. They released five albums, twelve singles and played thousands of gigs. While Little Hornet was working on their fifth album, Hatchman formed another band, Chicaine. The band was renamed Blue, with Hatchman as drummer and lead vocalist.
The Screaming Jets
The Screaming Jets guitarist Grant Walmsley had seen Hatchman playing drums in Little Hornet. The Sreaming Jets had already released five studio albums and were looking for a replacement for departed drummer Craig Rosevear—Hatchman joined in 2001. They made headlines when kicked off an aeroplane on the way home from a tour. With Hatchman, the band recorded a double live album Live Forever in June. Soon after, they took a break and returned to touring and performing in late 2002. They recorded an EP, Heart of the Matter, which was released in August 2004.
Dirty Skanks
Australian guitarist Nathan Cavaleri was looking to start a new band, Dirty Skanks, and approached Hatchman. The two began jamming and writing new music. Hatchman was recording, mixing & shooting video clips for the Dirty Skanks' debut album, Voluptuosity in between touring commitments with The Screaming Jets. At the end of 2003 the album, Voluptuosity was released with its first single "MILF" being picked up by radio stations in the country.
With touring schedules beginning to clash, Hatchman left The Screaming Jets and their last show was filmed for a live DVD Rock On, which was released the following year. More singles from Dirty Skanks' Voluptuosity, “Backyard Parties” and “Shots” were released in 2005 which was received by radio stations and picked up by cable channels across Australia.
In August 2006, Hatchman broke the Guinness World Record, as the 'Loudest Drummer in the World'—the sound of their acoustic drums being played was measured at 137.2 dBA.
They have begun schooling a new generation of drummers at The Rockstatution and they played shows at the Newcastle Civic Theatre.
The Band formed with guitarist Nathan Cavaleri "Dirty Skanks" have formed into a new group with the moniker Nat Col and the Kings. Have begun touring with fellow Aussie Rockers Electric Mary, playing several shows through September - October 2010.

Egyptian Ratscrew (ERS) or Slap is a modern American card game of the matching family and popular with children. The game is similar to the 19th-century British card game beggar-my-neighbour, with the added concept of "slapping" cards when certain combinations are played, similar to and perhaps borrowed from Slapjack.
Rules
The game is played with a standard 52-card deck or with multiple standard decks shuffled together for larger numbers of players. The number of players is limited only by each player's ability to reach the central pile at an arm's length. Each player is dealt a number of cards; cards are dealt as evenly as possible. As a variation, one or more Jokers may be added to ensure an even deal or to change gameplay.
Players are not allowed to look at their cards at any time, even when playing a card from their hand. The player to the left of the dealer begins by placing a card face-up, always from the top of their deck, to start a central discard pile. When playing a card, the player must reveal the card to all players at the same time by flipping the card away from themselves before placing it onto the pile face-up. Penalties may apply if the player reveals a card they play toward themselves first. Alternative to this, as hands with bad technique are more directly above the cards they place, any player can slap the hands of such players down, resulting in a penalty for the player whose hand is on the bottom as they will likely have incorrectly slapped - see versions of this later in article.
Play proceeds around the circle and each player takes turns laying down one card on the central pile at a time until a face card or Ace is played (making that player the "challenger" for that moment in play). The next player (the "challenged") then has a number of chances to play another face card or Ace, as follows: four chances after an Ace, three after a King, two after a Queen, and one after a Jack. Some play with four chances after an Ace, three after a Jack, two after a Queen, and one after a King. The challenged player plays their cards, one at a time, until they either draw another face card onto the pile or exhausts all of their allowed chances. If the challenged player is able to play a face card or Ace, the next player in turn order must beat it; if the initial face card could not be beaten in its allotted number of cards, the last challenger who placed it takes the pile.
Any player who takes a pile is always the one to start the next pile. When taken, piles are always added to a player's deck underneath, face-down, without being shuffled first.
The player who collects every card in the deck wins the game.
Slapping
In addition to the basic progression of play, players should agree beforehand on certain card combinations that, when played, entitle whoever slaps the pile first to subsequently claim it. The simplest and most common combination is the Double (any two cards of equal rank). Other common combinations include Sandwich (a double with one card of a different rank between the two), Hoagie (a double with two cards of a different rank between the two), Run (three or more cards in ascending or descending order of rank; e.g. 7, 6, 5; 10, Jack, Queen), Flush (three or more cards of the same suit), Tens (two cards with ranks adding up to 10), Top Bottom (the first card played is played again later on), and Marriage (King and Queen on top of each other).
Additionally, slaps can be added for other types of conditions, such as suit/colour (the same three/four times in a row, respectively), or for being the same as the initial card (e.g. a 3 at any time when if first card played was a three; to make this less common, a suit/colour can also be specified, e.g. a red three if the first three played was red). Another condition that can be added is when meeting a challenge if the number of the card played (e.g. the second card played) matches the card's value (in this case, a two), then this is slap-able. For even more confusion, jokers can be differentiated, e.g. the red joker is an instant slap but the black joker challenges with 13 chances.
For a legitimate slap, the player to react the fastest and slap the pile first claims the pile. If multiple players slap simultaneously with no discernible victor, then the player whose hand is under all of the others or has the most contact with the cards by comparison takes the pile.
Hands must be entirely withdrawn before the pile may be slapped. It is considered unfair to hover one's hand too close to the pile and slap frequently.
Optional rules which negate this includes slapping with the hand not delivering the card to the pile, Redneck Rules (wherein players, or convicted players, must bring their hand to their foreheads before being able to slap with that hand), or sleuthing or burning cards (putting the top card of the offending player's own deck on the bottom of the pile) as punishment for illegitimate slaps.
Player elimination
Players who have no cards left to play are eliminated. If a player has fewer cards than chances left while trying to counter a face card and runs out of their deck without countering, either the next player continues attempting to counter the face card with the current chances left or that particular play ends and the pile goes to the player who laid down the face card.
Even without cards, eliminated players can "slap in" on any appropriate card combination and re-enter the game as long as there are at least two people still containing cards. If the last remaining active person runs out of cards while trying to counter a face card and is unsuccessful, the pile goes to the player who played the face card and the player who has all the cards plays 3 more cards for one last chance for the opponent to slap back in.
Penalties
The player who slaps the pile when the card combination does not merit a slap must discard one or more of their cards and place them face-up at the bottom of the pile, then play resumes according to the card last played. Alternatively, if the player is caught taking cards or slapping illegally, the play can be contested: if the play was legal, any players who contested the play must give the top card of their deck to the contested player, while if the play was illegal, the contested player must give a card from the top of their deck to each player that contested the play, and the round continues. Cards gained in this way are, as usual, placed at the bottom of the player's deck. This, as well as adding a small element of bluffing into the game, helps to keep the play fast by both discouraging people from slapping incorrectly and discouraging people from always claiming another has done so and asking to check.
Players with no cards get a strike for each illegitimate slap and after the third strike, become unable to slap in until the next game or, in another variation, "burn their hands" (placing the hand on the bottom of the pile and waiting to be slapped). In this variation, once the pile is awarded or someone slaps, the offender's hand must no longer stay under the pile, and they can resume trying to slap/snap back in.
If cards are played out of turn, these cards become dead cards. They can be either placed at the bottom of the pile or left alone wherever they land. Either way, dead cards do not make for legitimate slaps. Any slap over a dead card, even if a player intentionally places it out of turn, results in a penalty. Penalty cards may be placed at the top of the deck as dead cards to create more confusion and potential illegitimate slaps.
In some cases, this same penalty is applied to certain rule violations, such as putting down a card when it is not one's turn and accidentally drawing multiple cards from one's deck and putting them on the pile.
Strategies
Memorising may help players recognize slapping possibilities before cards are set onto the pile. For example, if a game has only two players and one player legitimately slaps a double, the other player may recognize that, later on in the game, the double will arise later on as a sandwich that can then be slapped.
Some players may also intentionally fake a slap, since in doing so a player can possibly convince another player to slap incorrectly as well, or obtain an advantageous position in the deck that the player remembered from previous pile collections in the game.
While gaining the entire deck is the object, it is virtually always advantageous to have a deck as rich in face cards as possible with as few non-face cards as possible; the chances are then higher that the player will play a face card (whether to become the first challenger, or to counter a face card as the challenged player). Non-face cards (often referred to as "filler") are disadvantageous as they dilute the face cards in the player's deck, possibly causing them to lose a desirable pile by not being able to counter a face card. This may lead players to refrain from slapping on card combinations if there are no face cards in the pile. They may find it more beneficial to take the slaps available, but it is player preference.
Also, when someone plays a face card, that person may want to slap on the last card dropped thereafter, (1st for Jack, 2nd for Queen, 3rd for King and 4th for Ace), regardless of knowing what that card might be. This strategy is profitable because the reward of the pile outweighs the risk of "burning" a card. This strategy is also known as a risk slap. The risk slap may be used by players who have a noticeable lead in cards and are comfortable with sacrificing one card on the chance they might gain the pile which they slapped. One counterstrategy is moving a card toward the pile quickly without putting it down on the last card dropped on a face card in order to provoke a risk slap. In case the next card is a face card, the player who has "burned" a card likely will not get it back unless they slap the pile or the challenges come back around the table to them. In some games, it may even be permissible to slap the final card, with no penalty.
Additionally, a player can intentionally slap incorrectly to "burn" a card or two leading up to a face card remembered from earlier in the game. This is especially useful if the preceding player has played a high value face card such as a jack, where there is only one chance to play a face card.
Strategy also exists in the delivery of the slap, from the deliberately cruel wearing of sharp rings (pointing downwards being the worst, as it penalizes the person who wins the pile from under you), to sliding one's hand onto the pile straight ahead rather than slapping downwards. House rules can limit the slap methods allowed.

The Quintin Blair House in Cody, Wyoming was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1952–53. The house is an example of Wright's "natural house" theme, emphasizing close integration of house and landscape. It is the only Wright building in Wyoming.
Ruth Taggart Blair was a student at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts during the 1930s. Them professor, Bruce Goff, took the class to visit Taliesin at Spring Green, Wisconsin, where they met Wright. In 1951 Ruth and Quintin Blair were visiting Arizona, when Ruth suggested that they visit Taliesin West in Arizona, Wright's winter home. They were met by Wright in the driveway, introduced themselves, and were invited to stay for lunch. At the luncheon, Wright expressed a desire to design a house for them, as they had no buildings in Wyoming. At Wright's suggestion, the Blairs bought some land away from town, as Wright did not want to design for a city lot. The house was completed in 1953.
The house is laid out on a by grid. The house is dominated by a low, nearly flat roof that flares dramatically over the living room, where three sides of the room are floor-to-ceiling glass. The windows have mitered corners, eliminating a support and giving the impression that the glass itself incorporates a right-angle bend. A small triangular bay projects from the glass wall as a piano niche, a common Wright element. Exterior wall materials are primarily locally quarried ashlar sandstone.
The site is a parcel near a small creek about below the house. Springs near the house have been dammed by a wall aligned with the piano bay's angled wall, forming a small pond. The house has been modified and somewhat enlarged, with consultation from Taliesin.
The Blair House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

Lines on an Autumnal Evening was composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1793. The poem, rewritten throughout Coleridge's life, discusses nature and love. As Coleridge developed and aged, the object of the poem changed to be various women that Coleridge had feelings toward.
Background
The poem, originally called Absence: A Poem describes Coleridge's moving to Ottery in August 1793 but claimed later in life that it dated back to 1792. The poem was addressed to a girl they met during June, Fanny Nesbitt, and is connected to two other poems dedicated to her: "On Presenting a Moss Rose to Miss F. Nesbitt" and "Cupid Turn'd Chymist". The poem was later published in a Dorset newspaper. An early draft of Lines: On an Autumnal Evening was titled An Effusion at Evening, Written in August 1793. Effusion was dedicated to Mary Evans and expressed their feelings for them After they married Sara Fricker, Coleridge revised the poem to match their new relationship.
The poem was rewritten many times, and other titles of the later versions include "Effusion", Written in Early Youth, The Time, An Autumnal Evening, and An Effusion on an Autumnal Evening. Written in Early Youth. The poem was included in Coleridge's 1796 collection with publications following in 1797, 1803, 1828, 1829, and 1834. It is documented that, on 7 November 1793, Coleridge read the poem to their friends from college. Of those hearing the poem was Christopher Wordsworth, William Wordsworth's younger brother, that later described Coleridge's poem "sickly diction".
Coleridge was accused of taking from Samuel Roger's "The Pleasures of Memory". In notes included to the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems, line 57 has written:
I entreat the Public's pardon for having carelessly suffered to be printed such intolerable stuff as this and the thirteen following lines. They have not the merit even of originality: as every thought is to be found in the Greek Epigrams. The lines in this poem from the 27th to the 36th, I have been told are a palpable imitation of the passage from the 355th to the 370th line of the Pleasures of Memory Part 3. I do not perceive so striking a similarity between the two passages; at all events I had written the Effusion several years before I had seen Mr Rogers' Poem.
Rogers's work was published in 1792, the year before, and it is possible that Coleridge concealed the original date of creating their poem. However, it is uncertain when Coleridge actually read Rogers's poem. According to the later critic Norman Fruman, "This would make the striking similarities of thought and phrase, however improbably, mere coincidence." Lucy Newlyn claims that "it would seem possible that the public acknowledgement of Wordsworth is there partly because it conceals the debt to Rogers" in Lines Written at Shurton Bars.
Poems
The poem opens with the narrator admonishing personified Fancy:
And the narrator then asks for them to serve a purpose inspiring them by making the land beautiful:
The narrator continues by seeking inspiration that they once had. The next passage describes an event that possibly happened between Coleridge and Evans or aspects of their relationship:
Soon after, there is an emphasis within the poem on the voice of the woman that they desire. This voice contains pity, which is a sign of caring:
The narrator soon wishes that they could become one with the landscape:
The poem concludes with night overcoming the world:
Themes
Lines is characterised by the use of traditional images of nature, archaic language, and personification. The poem opens with the word "Fancy", but the original word was "Imagination". During Coleridge's early writing, they alternate between the words and does not seem to distinguish between them. According to Virginia Radley, "At this point, they may have begun to evolve their famous distinction between the two terms, although there is no way of proving this." There is also a connection between nature and inspiration, a theme later picked up in Percy Shelley's poetry. However, nature's inspiration does not last and nature only acts passively when it comes to inspiring. These themes connect the poem to Coleridge's later poem "The Eolian Harp", especially in its use of time and evening. There is also a connection to the ideas of Wordsworth's An Evening Walk and Collins's "Ode to Evening" in the replacement of nature with imagination.
The narrator is interested in nature not for nature but for their connection to a woman during a previous time. The image of the woman within the poem combines with the image of Fancy, and the narrator focuses on trying to recreate the time that they were with the woman. The woman is a source of pity, which is commonly a means for women to express caring within Coleridge's poetry. To be closer to that pity, the narrator wishes to become part of nature. Although they would be intimate, their relationship would be unconsummated. The effort to think about the woman causes the narrator to become tired, and the darkness represents a realistic and symbolic closing of the poem.
Critical response
Radley argues that "this poetry, as poetry, is certainly inferior to that which distinguishes the poetry of the 'Major Minor Poems,' though in many respects it is on a par with that comprising the Juvenalia. Such overworked cliches [...] combine with the other characteristics cited to make the poem reminiscent of another age, yet meretriciously so." Later, Hendrik Rookmaaker points out that "It is remarkable that in this poem the visions of the poet are not only unrelated to the scenery surrounding him, but are in fact incompatible with it (sunset versus 'gleam of dawn' and 'moon-beams'). About a year later they condemn this lack of harmony between vision and nature, inner and outer."

It is a rare, yet potentially fatal event that could be caused by trauma and multiple non-traumatic conditions. Despite the unclear etiology, there are several risk factors of adrenal hemorrhage, including birth trauma, sepsis, and hemorrhagic disorders. Anoxia and sepsis are the most frequent causes at birth, while adrenal insufficiency often manifests in neonates.
According to the degree and rate of hemorrhage, its clinical manifestations can vary widely. The non-specific signs and symptoms in prominent underlying diseases often prevent prompt recognition and proper treatment of the condition, which may result in adrenal crisis, shock, and death. Although the mortality rate varies with the severity of the underlying inductive disease, adrenal hemorrhage is related to 15% of the deaths.
In the US, the incidence rate is reported to be 0.3-1.8% based on unselected cases in autopsy studies. In terms of age group, higher prevalence is found among neonates, with an incidence rate of 0.17% in infant autopsies and 3% in infant abdominal ultrasound examination.
Diagnosis in the early phase is critical, though it is relatively rare due to non-characteristic clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Imaging and laboratory studies are often employed for diagnosis and surveillance. Non-operative management has taken over surgical exploration and has become the main approach to treating both traumatic and non-traumatic adrenal hemorrhage.
Classification
Bilateral and Unilateral
Considering the site of bleeding, adrenal hemorrhage could be classified as unilateral and bilateral. The former type is more frequently reported.
Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage is the condition when bleeding occurs in both adrenal glands, which could be instantly life-threatening. Over half of the bilateral cases are related to acute stress, such as infection, congestive myocardial infarction, complications of pregnancy, surgery or invasive procedure. Other common causes include hemorrhagic diatheses, thromboembolic diseases, blunt trauma, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) therapy. With sepsis, the mortality rate of this condition can reach 90%.
Unilateral adrenal hemorrhage is the condition when bleeding occurs in either one of the adrenal glands, predominantly on the right that accounts for around three-quarters of the cases. It is usually associated with blunt force abdominal trauma, primary adrenal or metastatic tumors, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and adrenal vein thrombosis. Liver transplantation can occasionally cause unilateral adrenal hemorrhage as well, with 2% occurrence in the right adrenal gland in patients received liver transplantation.
Traumatic and non-traumatic
Adrenal hemorrhage is classified by its cause, traumatic or non-traumatic.
Trauma, either by blunt force or penetration, accounts for 80% of the cases. Up to a quarter of severely injured patients suffer from adrenal hemorrhage. Direct compression of adrenal glands and acute intravenous pressure rise due to compression of the inferior vena cava are the two proposed mechanisms of traumatic adrenal gland injury.
Non-traumatic adrenal hemorrhage is an atypical type, which can be further categorised as acute stress and neonatal stress, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), anti-coagulation, spontaneous, and tumor-related.
Acute stress includes stress resulting from overwhelming sepsis, pregnancy, hypotension, and administration of ACTH, which gradually increases blood flow to the adrenal gland and glucocorticoid secretion, and leads to haemorrhage because of the higher pressure within the adrenal glands. The cause of neonatal stress, however, remains undetermined.
Patients with APS are prone to recurring adrenal vein thrombosis that might cause hemorrhagic infarction of the adrenal gland, making it a major risk factor of adrenal hemorrhage.
Using anti-coagulant like heparin is also major cause of non-traumatic adrenal hemorrhage. For instance, heparin could lead to adrenal hemorrhage by potentiating the bleeding risk in patients with acute illness or inducing thrombocytopenia that causes thrombosis of the central adrenal vein.
The spontaneous type is an uncommon postoperative complication with subtle clinical findings, which has higher occurrence in patients subjected to severe stress and may occur without potential inductive conditions.
In the cases with underlying tumors, benign lesions including adrenal cyst and myelolipoma bigger than 10 cm may spontaneously bleed into the adrenal gland or retroperitoneum. Massive bleeding from a primary adrenal tumor could be fatal in up to half of the reported cases, which are most resulted from pheochromocytoma.
Pathophysiology
Adrenal gland is vulnerable to hemorrhage due to its special vascular supply. It has rich blood supply via 50 to 60 small arterial branches from three adrenal arteries. The branches then form a sub-capsular plexus within the adrenal cortex, which drains into medullary sinusoids through relatively fewer venules and flows into a single vein, creating a potential “vascular dam”. The limited venous drainage builds the blood flow resistance and adrenal venous pressure, resulting in the hemorrhage into the gland.
Under physiological stress, ACTH and catecholamine secretion increases, which further promotes adrenal arterial blood flow. Increased catecholamine level constricts the venules and enhances platelet aggregation, which may induce adrenal vein thrombosis. The synergistical effect builds up pressure within the venous sinusoids, predisposing to adrenal gland congestion and venous stasis.
While the elevated intravascular pressure increases vascular wall tension proportionally, hemorrhage occurs when the tension within the thin adrenal venous walls exceeds their tolerance. Under traumatic situations, direct compression between the spine and the abdominal organs cushioning adrenal glands, such as spleen and liver, could result in hemorrhage by increasing the intravascular pressure or cause vessel rupture directly.
Sign and symptoms
Nonspecific pain is the most consistent symptom, with over 65% occurrence in published cases. Meanwhile, fever happens most frequently, presenting in 50-70% of patients with adrenal hemorrhage. Other symptoms of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage include adrenal insufficiency, tachycardia (as reported in 40-50% patients in early phases, can develop into shock),hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, pre-renal azotemia, acidosis and positive ACTH stimulation test. These symptoms can also be present in other adrenal abnormalities and are difficult to be differentiated from underlying conditions resulting in adrenal insufficiency. For unilateral adrenal hemorrhage, it does not show biochemically significant conditions.
Diagnosis
Laboratory studies
Laboratory test findings are non-specific. Identification of adrenal hemorrhage cannot rely on laboratory findings alone.
However, several signs of adrenal hemorrhage can be observed through blood tests. At least 4% decrease in hematocrit (i.e. volume of erythrocytes to total blood volume ratio), and a minimum of 2g/dL decrease in hemoglobin are observed in around half of the patients with bilateral adrenal hemorrhage. Leukocytosis is a frequently occurring condition, which may be related to the predisposing condition.
Imaging
Pre-mortem diagnosis of adrenal hemorrhage relies mainly on cross-sectional imaging, namely computed tomography (CT) scanning, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Adrenal hemorrhage could be detected by showing non-specific enlargement and hemorrhage into one or both adrenal glands in images.
CT scanning is the most common imaging test screening for adrenal hemorrhage. Its rising availability has facilitated pre-mortem diagnosis of adrenal hemorrhage that is featured by a round or oval mass at the adrenal gland.
Appearance of adrenal hematomas are in large number, but with low similarity. Some of the patterns are distinct in adrenal hemorrhage while the other are undifferentiated from other adrenal abnormalities, such as adrenal neoplasm, adrenocortical carcinomas, and pheochromocytomas.
Hematomas have solid adrenal nodules, size of which are comparable to soft tissue and diminish over time. Partially solid and partially cystic lesions can present in many adrenal abnormalities. Compared to neoplasm, hematomas show higher density in pre-contrast scans with solid components tending to locate peripherally while fluid locating centrally.
Retroperitoneal ill-defined soft tissue stranding is developed in around 90% of traumatic adrenal hemorrhage cases due to infiltration of blood through the retroperitoneal fat. Diffuse thickening of adrenal glands bilaterally can be observed.
Adrenal hematomas with active hemorrhage are the most critical pattern to recognize. It is a rare condition, yet emergent embolization is required.
Abdominal ultrasound examination serves as an effective non-invasive diagnostic tool for adrenal hemorrhage. Because of the non-exposure to ionizing radiation and a relatively high neonatal adrenal gland size to body size ratio that is sufficient for examination, ultrasound would be the preference for newborn patients.
An adrenal hemorrhage appears as a mass superior to the fetal kidneys. The time-dependent variation of echogenicity patterning (i.e. echotexture) and hematoma size of its sequential sonographic appearance helps indicate the stage of hemorrhage. In the early stage, hematoma of the adrenal gland appears solid with diffuse or heterogenous echogenicity, the ability to return a signal in the ultrasound examination. As the lesion liquefies, a hypoechoic centre is developed. At last, the lesion would become entirely anechoic, with or without septations. Color Doppler could be used to confirm the absence of associated intrinsic vascularity of the lesion at different stages. Besides, the adrenal hematoma might calcify during the resolution phase, and the retroperitoneal calcifications are often peripheral and look egg-shaped.
Other methods are adopted as the patients grow because the imaging of adrenal gland would become more difficult with ultrasound.
MRI is the most sensitive and specific method for adrenal hemorrhage diagnosis. On MRI, haemorrhages could appear as different signals in the acute, subacute and chronic stages, which facilitates the surveillance of adrenal hemorrhage aging. In the acute stage, which is within the first week after onset, the adrenal hematomas appear isointense or slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images, and notably hypointense on T2-weighted images relative to liver. This is resulted from the high concentration of intracellular deoxyhemoglobin that leads to preferential T2 proton relaxation enhancement.
Progressing to the subacute stage, the following six weeks, hemoglobin oxidizes upon aging. This produces methemoglobin whose paramagnetic effect results in hematomas appearing hyperintense on T1- and T2-weighted images.
In the chronic stage, the periphery of adrenal hematoma gradually becomes hyperintense, leaving a hypointense rim on T1- and T2-weighted images due to the hemosiderin deposition and development of a fibrous capsule.
Management
In most literature, surgery is frequently adopted among the cases involving trauma-associated adrenal hemorrhage. It treats the hemorrhage by adrenal repair or adrenalectomy, depending on the extent of injury, the viability of residual adrenal tissue, the status of contralateral adrenal gland, and the stability of the patient. Adrenal repair included closing the adrenal capsule with running non-absorbable suture, and placing interrupted mattress sutures when needed. Adrenalectomy could be either unilateral or bilateral, the surgical removal of namely one or both adrenal glands.
Non-operative management can treat most of the adrenal haemorrhage cases nowadays, both traumatic and non-traumatic. A larger proportion of patients have been successfully cured with surveillance while more reports suggested that surgical intervention is not needed. Some adrenal injured trauma patients with absence of continuous bleeding are suggested to take non-operative management, when there is no other indication for abdominal exploration. Supportive care, serial hematocrit measurement, and administration of blood transfusions upon needs to constitute the non-operative management.
Timely steroid replacement is a non-operative treatment targeting bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, which is crucial for survival. Intravenous hydrocortisone and fluid resuscitation with normal saline are also preferred regarding this type. For patients with suspected acute, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, administration of glucocorticoids is suggested to prevent or alleviate acute adrenal insufficiency.
Follow-up surveillance by serial CT scanning and MRI also plays a critical role in adrenal hemorrhage non-operative management. By assessing the resolution and size of hematoma to track the temporal evolution of an adrenal hemorrhage, the benign adrenal hematoma could be differentiated from a pre-existing mass lesion that requires surgical removal.

Migrating motor complex, also known as migrating myoelectric complex, migratory motor complex, migratory myoelectric complex and MMC, is a pattern of electrical activity observed in the gastrointestinal tract in a regular cycle during fasting. MMC was discovered and characterized in fasting dogs in 1969 by Dr. Joseph H. Szurszewski at the Mayo Clinic. They also showed that this activity stops upon eating a meal, and suggested that it induces a motor activity that acts as a "interdigestive housekeeper" in the small intestine. These motor complexes trigger peristaltic waves, which facilitate transportation of indigestible substances such as bone, fiber, and foreign bodies from the stomach, through the small intestine, past the ileocecal sphincter, and into the colon. MMC activity varies widely across individuals and within an individual when measured on different days. The MMC occurs every 90–230 minutes during the interdigestive phase (i.e., between meals) and is responsible for the rumbling experienced when hungry. It also serves to transport bacteria from the small intestine to the large intestine and to inhibit the migration of colonic bacteria into the terminal ileum; an impairment to the MMC typically results in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
Phases
The MMC originates mostly in the stomach—although ~25% will arise from the duodenum or proximal jejunum—and can travel to the distal end of the ileum. They consist of four distinct phases:
Phase I – A prolonged period of quiescence (40–60% of total time);
Phase II – Increased frequency of action potentials and smooth muscle contractility (20–30% of total time);
Phase III – A few minutes of peak electrical and mechanical activity (5–10 minutes);
Phase IV – Declining activity which merges with the next Phase I.
Regulation
Movements of the small bowel are believed to be controlled by the central and enteric nervous systems, intestinal muscles, and numerous peptides and hormones. For example, the MMC is thought to be initiated by motilin, and it does not directly depend on extrinsic nerves. Additionally, gastrin, insulin, cholecystokinin, glucagon, and secretin have been reported to disrupt the MMC.
Eating interrupts the MMC. For example, one study found that a continental breakfast of 450 Kcal causes the MMC to disappear for 213 ± 48 minutes. The number of calories and nature of food determine the length of the disruption with fats causing a longer disruption than carbohydrates which in turn cause a longer disruption than protein.
Most of the cleaning waves in the MMC happen at night while we are asleep. For many people this will be sufficient enough to help maintain a healthy, balanced environment in the digestive tract. For others, it may be beneficial to space out food intake to allow for a couple cleaning waves to occur between meals throughout the day as well.
Impairment
Autoimmunity following infection by a pathogen producing CdtB, such as C. jejuni, may be the leading cause of MMC impairment. Narcotics are also known to impair the MMC. Stress has been shown to reduce MMC activity as well.
Patients with SIBO and IBS have on average a third as many MMC phase III events with those events being roughly 30% shorter on average.
Therapeutic stimuli
Drugs used to enhance gastrointestinal motility are generally referred to as prokinetics. Serotonin induces phase III of the MMC, and so serotonin receptor agonists are commonly administered as prokinetics. Motilin administration causes phase III contractions, and so motilin agonists are another common prokinetic.
Eradication of bacterial overgrowth has been shown to partially restore MMC activity.
An elemental diet has been hypothesized to partially restore MMC function.

Patrick Eagar (born 1944) is a British cricket photographer, who took photos at 325 Test matches, including 98 Ashes Test matches, between 1965 and 2011.
Early life
Patrick Eagar is the son of former Hampshire cricket captain Desmond Eagar.
Eagar's first camera was given to them by their grandmother when they were 8 or 9 years old. Eagar studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where they studied modern sciences, before switching to anthropology. During their time at Cambridge, Eagar worked for Varsity newspaper and Image. In 1966, Eagar worked for five months taking photos at a children's hospital in Saigon. Eagar particularly liked the photography in Sports Illustrated.
Career
During the 1963 West Indies series in England, Eagar took a photograph of Wes Hall breaking Colin Cowdrey's arm in the Lord's Test match. This was in spite of the fact that the ground did not permit photography. The first Test match where Eagar was an official photographer was the 1965 match at Headingley between England and New Zealand; John Edrich scored a triple century in the match.
After a rise in freelance photographers, Eagar began to cover matches on a more frequent basis, beginning with the 1972 Ashes series in England. In the 1972 Headingley Ashes Test, Eagar had just one over to take a photograph for The Sunday Times to use for the next day's newspaper. During the 1970s, they produced photographs for the Wisden Cricket Monthly and The Cricketer magazines. Their best-known photos include Rod Marsh's catch to dismiss Tony Greig in a 1975 Cricket World Cup match at Headingley, England captain Michael Vaughan holding The Ashes urn after England won the 2005 Ashes, and Andrew Strauss' catch in the same series. In interview, Eagar said that their favourite photo was of Gordon Greenidge playing cricket on the beach in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1973, and that their favourite player to photograph was Kim Hughes, due to their improvisation at the crease.
In 2005, Eagar held an exhibit of their Test match cricket photography at Lord's. The 300th Test match where Eagar took photos was at Lord's in 2007, and the 2010 Ashes match in Perth was their 100th England-Australia Test match.
In early 2011, Eagar announced that they were retiring. They had covered 325 Test matches, including 98 Ashes Tests. They had produced over half a million images. In a post-retirement interview, Eagar reckoned that Richie Benaud and John Woodcock had seen more Test matches than him. Also in 2011, Eagar was awarded the Doug Gardner Award at the British Sports Journalism Awards.

The Burns Building is a historic six-story building located in downtown Calgary, Alberta. It sits at 237-8th Ave. S.E. on the end of Stephen Avenue overlooking Olympic Plaza and City Hall.
History
The building was commissioned by meat baron Pat Burns as the corporate headquarters and flagship market for their empire, Burns Foods. Burns bought the property around 1909 but excavation did not begin until the fall of 1911. Construction commenced in April 1912. 1913 was a big year for building in Calgary. The Palliser Hotel, Lancaster Block, Canada Life Building and the Hudson's Bay store were built. The Herald Building (demolished in 1972 and now the site of the Len Werry Building) was also under construction.
In 1923 Pat Burns exchanged the building for the Glengarry Ranch.
Original use
The ground level provided retail space for Burns' retail meat market. The long market hall featured twelve high Doric marble columns. Burns leased out the remaining of office space to a wide variety of tenants. Historian Hugh Dempsey wrote, "the list of businesses which occupied the Patrick Burns Building…reads like a corporate Who's Who." Calgary Power, Alberta Investment and Insurance Brokers, Rocky Mountain Cement and a variety of dentists, doctors, lawyers, realtors, insurance agents and accountants were among the first tenants.
Architecture
The building was built in the style of Edwardian Classical. The exterior features Lions' heads and other ornamental mouldings sculptured in the surface of the terracotta. Inside white and green Italian marble was used to finish the main stairways and corridors. The building included modern conveniences like steam heating and ventilation. In addition to electricity, each office was equipped with natural gas lighting.
Between 1981 and 1984 the building underwent extensive renovations designed by architects A.J. Diamond and Partners with Carruthers and McCullum.
Historic status
Around 1980 the demolition of the Burns building became a possibility when it was proposed that the property it sat on was needed for the construction of the Calgary Centre for the Performing Arts. In a June 1980 report the situation was clearly outlined. "Our [the city's] urban planning consultants (Hanen and Moriyama) have recommended that two heritage buildings in this block be preserved, namely the Calgary Public Building and the Burns Building. At the time of the recommendation it was thought possible to fit the necessary concert halls and theatres in and around the two old buildings. A more detailed study by the architects for the performing arts group [Stevenson Raines] and their theatre consultants has indicated that while this can be done, a better result can be achieved if the land under the Burns Building were to be available for performing arts purposes." Ultimately the demolition proposal was defeated by one City Council vote. The Burns Building, like the Public Building was saved and incorporated into the design of Performing Arts Centre.
In 1987 it was officially designated a Provincial Heritage Resource.

In eighteenth and nineteenth century German philosophy, a Zeitgeist () ("spirit of the age") is an invisible agent or force dominating the characteristics of a given epoch in world history.
Now, the term is usually associated with Georg W. F. Hegel, contrasting with Hegel's use of Volksgeist "national spirit" and Weltgeist "world-spirit".
Its coinage and popularization precedes Hegel, and is mostly due to Herder and Goethe. Other philosophers who were associated with such concepts include Spencer and Voltaire.
Contemporary use of the term sometimes, more colloquially, refers to a schema of fashions or fads that prescribes what is considered to be acceptable or tasteful for an era: e.g., in the field of architecture.
Theory of leadership
Hegel in Phenomenology of the Spirit (1807) uses both Weltgeist and Volksgeist, but prefers the phrase Geist der Zeiten "spirit of the times" over the compound Zeitgeist.
The Hegelian concept contrasts with the Great Man theory as by Thomas Carlyle, which sees history as the result of the actions of heroes and geniuses, as Hegel perceived such "great men", specifically Napoleon, as the "embodiment of the world-spirit" (Die Weltseele zu Pferde "the world-soul on horseback")
A "zeitgeist theory of leadership" has been contrasted with Thomas Carlyle's great man theory by Forsyth (2009). In their theory, Carlyle stresses that leaders do not become leaders by fate or accident. Instead, these individuals possess characteristics of great leaders and these characteristics allow them to obtain positions of power.
According to Forsyth, Leo Tolstoy disagreed with Carlyle's perspective,
instead believing that leadership, like other things, was a product of the "zeitgeist", the social circumstances at the time.
Great man theory and zeitgeist theory may be included in two main areas of thought in psychology. For instance, great man theory is very similar to the trait approach. Trait researchers are interested in identifying the various personality traits that underline human behaviors such as conformity, leadership, or other social behaviors. Thus, they agree that leadership is primarily a quality of an individual and that some people are pre-dispositioned to be a leader whereas others are born to follow these leaders. In contrast, situationist researchers believe that social behavior is a product of society. That is, social influence is what determines human behaviors. Therefore, situationism is of the same opinion as zeitgeist theory—leaders are created from the social environment and are molded from the situation. The concept of zeitgeist also relates to the sociological tradition that stems from Émile Durkheim and recently developed into social capital theory as exemplified by the work of Patrick Hunout.
These two perspectives have been combined to create what is known as the interactional approach to leadership. This approach asserts that leadership is developed through the mixing of personality traits and the situation. Further, this approach was expressed by social psychologist, Kurt Lewin, by the equation B = f(P, E) where behavior (B) is a function (f) of the person (P) and the environment (E).
In self-help and business models
Executives, venture capitalists, journalists, and authors have argued that the idea of a zeitgeist is useful in understanding the emergence of industries, simultaneous invention, and evaluating the relative value of innovations. Malcolm Gladwell argued in their book, Outliers, that entrepreneurs who succeeded often share similar characteristics—early personal or significant exposure to knowledge and skills in the early stages of a nascent industry. They proposed that the timing of involvement in an industry, and often in sports as well, affected the probability of success. In Silicon Valley, a number of people (Peter Thiel, Alistair Davidson, Mac Levchin, Nicholas G. Carr, Vinod Khosla) have argued that much innovation has been shaped by easy access to the Internet, open source software, component technologies for both hardware and software (e.g., software libraries, software as a service), and the ability to reach narrow markets across a global market. Peter Thiel has commented: "There is so much incrementalism now."
In a zeitgeist market, the number of new entrants is high, differentiation in high value products (the strongest predictor of new product success) is more difficult to achieve, and business models emphasizing service and solution over product and process, will enhance success. Examples include innovation in product experience, legal rights and bundling, privacy rights, and agency (where businesses act on behalf of customers).
Aesthetic fashion
Hegel believed that art reflected, by its very nature, the culture of the time in which it is created. Culture and art are inextricable because an individual artist is a product of their or their time and therefore brings that culture to any given work of art. Furthermore, they believed that in the modern world it was impossible to produce classical art, which they believed represented a "free and ethical culture", which depended more on the philosophy of art and theory of art, rather than a reflection of the social construct, or Zeitgeist in which a given artist lives.
This use of zeitgeist is taken in the sense of intellectual or aesthetic fashion or fad. Research from empirical aesthetics investigated the relation between zeitgeist as temporal context and the evaluation of creative works. In a study of the musical originality of 15,618 classical music themes, the importance of objective characteristics and zeitgeist for popularity was examined. Both the musical originality of a theme relative to its contemporary works (the zeitgeist), and its "absolute" originality influenced in similar magnitude the popularity of a theme. Similarly, objective features and temporal context both influenced the evaluation of linguistic originality.

Queens is the Future is a mural created in 2007 by married artists Eve Biddle and Joshua Frankel. It is located on a handball court in the schoolyard of I.S. 145, a public middle school in Jackson Heights, Queens. The mural originally depicted a subway car blasting off of its tracks as though powered by rocket fuel, with the words “Queens is the Future” painted in the upper left corner. It quickly became an iconic image of the borough, inspiring the Municipal Art Society to name their walking tour of neighborhood after the work, as well as appearing in Sports Illustrated, Time Out New York, and a short documentary about the rise of Bronx and Queens Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
In January 2015, without consulting the original artists, Sony Pictures altered the mural, inserting Spider-Man into the image, to promote the release of the film The Amazing Spider-Man 2.
Inspiration
Biddle and Frankel were inspired to create the mural while living in Long Island City, Queens and traveling to Jackson Heights regularly to have lunch with Frankel's mother, a public school teacher there. The elevated 7 trains, a subway line, which runs across Roosevelt Avenue and is a distinctive architectural feature of Jackson Heights, was one of the inspirations for the image. Having both grown up in New York City in the 1980s, the artists were influenced by graffiti and other public art they saw as children and young adults including Keith Haring's iconic Crack is Wack mural, which was also painted on a handball wall.
The phrase “Queens Is The Future” points to Queens' status as the United States of America's most diverse populous county. Like Queens, America itself is becoming more international, more urban, and less white.
Queens is the Future details
Style
Queens is the Future incorporates graffiti and comic book graphic style with a minimalist color scheme. The banner reading “Queens is the Future” mimics a style of typography found in early 20th century cruise ship and transportation advertising, which utilized the American Modernist “poster portrait” style typified by artists like Charles DeMuth. The low-angle view of the train also evokes a perspective often found in these ads.
Desecration and restoration
In January 2015, without consulting the original artists, Sony Pictures altered the mural, inserting Spider-Man into the image, to promote the release of the film The Amazing Spider-Man 2.
In the altered mural, Spider-Man lifts the subway car off the tracks “rescuing” children who've been inserted into the train's windows, a contrast to the original message of the work. The alterations also included the addition of the geographically inaccurate image of the Statue of Liberty, which is not visible from Jackson Heights. The mural was selected by Sony because the character is from Forest Hills, Queens. NYC Service, a city agency, introduced Sony to I.S. 145. The alterations were executed by artist Ibrahim Wann. Actor Andrew Garfield and other cast members appeared at an unveiling of the altered mural at the school, which was attended by students and other neighborhood residents.
Biddle and Frankel understood the students' excitement around this event, but Frankel expressed their disappointment in the mural's repurposing: “They took a work of public art in the community and turned it into an advertisement for the film, and called it community service.”
The mural was restored in 2022.
Legacy
The original mural inspired the Municipal Art Society to name their walking tour “Queens is the Future.” A photograph of the mural appears prominently in a 2015 print edition issue of Time Out New York celebrating Queens as “New York's hottest borough.” The work also appears in Seth Fein's 2017 experimental documentary film Between Neighborhoods.

The Henderson Park-West Main Hill Historic District is a primarily residential historic district roughly bounded by West Main, Thompson, Academy, Monroe, West Lovell and Valley Streets and Prairie Avenue in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
History
In the 1850s, much of the land in the current district was owned by farmer James Taylor. Taylor apparently platted part of it in 1852, but there was little development, as the area was uphill and inconvenient to access from Kalamazoo. Taylor's daughter eventually married Frank Henderson. Henderson had arrived in Kalamazoo in 1855 and started a saddlery in 1864. In 1874, they began a business making uniform and regalia business, including Masonic regalia, which proved more lucrative than the saddle-making business. In the later 1800s, Kalamazoo grew outwards toward Taylor's lands, now owned by Henderson and their wife. By 1888, horse trams were introduced, making the area suddenly more accessible. Henderson decided to replat the area, and hired surveyor Frank Hodgman and civil engineer George S. Pierson to lay out a series of curvilinear streets.
In 1890–1894, Henderson built their own "castle," bringing the area to prominence in Kalamazoo's society. However, lots in the area were slow to sell until after the turn of the century, when Kalamazoo's business boom brought increased pressure on housing. The simultaneous growth of Kalamazoo College and the founding of Western Normal School (now Western Michigan University), both quite near the neighborhood, ensured the success of the area, with the lots substantially filled by the 1920s. Early residents of the area included professors from both Kalamazoo College and Western Michigan University, as well as small business owners and other professionals.
Description
The Henderson Park-West Main Hill Historic District contains 140 buildings constructed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The neighborhood is set on curved, tree-lined, hilly streets, with buildings set back from the road. Nearly all of the buildings are single family residences, built for high-status families and primarily in early twentieth-century period revival architectural styles. One school is also in the district, as well as two parks. The houses are of similar scale and style, widely separated from one another.

The Port of Toronto is an inland port on the northwest shoreline of Lake Ontario in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The port covers over of land on the eastern shore of the Toronto Harbour, in an area known as the Port Lands. The port includes several facilities, including Marine Terminal 51, Warehouse 52, and the International Marine Passenger Terminal. The Port of Toronto is operated by PortsToronto.
The first commercial ship to use Toronto as a port was in 1751. In 1793, governance of the port was assumed by the Province of Upper Canada. In 1911, the federal government of Canada formed the Toronto Harbour Commission to operate the Port of Toronto. The Port of Toronto was expanded in the first half of the 20th century, with the expansion of the Port Lands, and the creation of new wharfs in present-day East Bayfront and other areas on the Toronto waterfront. Port activity increased in the mid-20th century with the opening of the Welland Canal in 1931, and the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. In 1999, port operations were transferred from the Toronto Harbour Commission to the Toronto Port Authority (later renamed PortsToronto). In 2005, the International Marine Passenger Terminal was opened.
History
The first commercial shipments to arrive in the Toronto shipment arrived at Fort Rouillé in 1751. It took until 1793, when Toronto was founded, for a shipping port to be established. In the early 1800s, the rise of steam-powered vessels and the opening of the Beauharnois Canal in 1985 and Williamsburg canal in 1849, made through travel by ship from the Atlantic Ocean to Toronto possible, greatly increasing the usage of the port. In the 1850s, the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway, the Grand Trunk Railway, and the Great Western Railway commenced operations to the port along the Toronto waterfront, transforming the port into a intermodal cargo hub. In 1858, the Eastern Gap was dug out, making it easier to access the port from the east side of Lake Ontario.
In 1911, the Toronto Harbour Commission was founded and from 1912 to 1925, the Toronto Harbour Commission, now PortsToronto, revealed a large overall plan for the Toronto waterfront. The plan saw the clearing of old piers, the filling of waterlots and the Port Lands area, where the current Port of Toronto of is located. In 1955, Marine Terminal 11 opened, it was the first of three 100,000-square-foot warehouses to be constructed. In 1959, the St. Lawrence Seaway was opened, making the port accessible to ocean freighters with a 27-foot draft. In 1962, the Toronto Harbour Commission took over operation of the marine terminals on the harbour. In 1966, Marine Terminal 51 opened at the entrance of the Shop Channel in the Port Lands. In 1969, Marine Terminal 35 became the busiest terminal in the harbour. and in 1985 intermodal operation commenced at the terminal.
Through the 1990s, traffic to the port decreased and more and more cargo was being transported over rail and roads. The current operator of the port, PortsToronto, was established in 1998 through the Canada Marine Act to help modernize and consolidate the declining operations at the port. Before this, the Port of Toronto had been governed by the Upper Canada, the Toronto Harbour Trust, and then the Toronto Harbour Commission. In 2005, the International Marine Passenger Terminal was opened. It was originally meant to be used by a ferry service to Rochester, but the service never started and in 2012, the terminal started to be used as a port of call for Great Lakes cruises.
Facilities
The port is made up of several port facilities, including Marine Terminal 51, Warehouse 52, and the International Marine Passenger Terminal.
There are of deep-water wharfage for the loading and unloading of bulk products. Marine terminals include inside and outside storage, and some of berthing space for ships carrying general cargo.
Services
Cargo
The tonnage of cargo passing through the port is made up mostly of sugar to the Redpath refinery and aggregate materials such as sand, gravel and salt. In 2015, the port received 1.7 million tonnes of cargo, 36th-largest in Canada. By comparison, Colborne, Ontario, shipped 1.671 million tonnes while Hamilton handled 13.66 million tonnes. Total tonnage handled in Canadian ports was 466.148 billion tonnes.
Passenger
Passenger traffic is handled by the International Marine Passenger Terminal. The terminal was originally built as a passenger terminal for a ferry to Rochester, New York, but the service was discontinued after less than one year. Since then, the terminal has seen growth as a port for Great Lakes cruises.

K-type main-sequence stars may be the candidates for supporting extraterrestrial life. These stars are known as "Goldilocks stars" as they emit enough radiation in the non-UV ray spectrum to provide a temperature that allows liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet; they also remain stable in the main sequence longer than the Sun by burning their hydrogen slower, allowing more time for life to form on a planet around a K-type main-sequence star. The planet's habitable zone, ranging from 0.1–0.4 to 0.3–1.3 astronomical units (AU), depending on the size of the star, is often far enough from the star so as not to be tidally locked to the star, and to have a sufficiently low solar flare activity not to be lethal to life. In comparison, red dwarf stars have too much solar activity and quickly tidally lock the planets in their habitable zones, making them less suitable for life. The odds of complex life arising may be better on planets around K-type main-sequence stars than around Sun-like stars, given the suitable temperature and extra time available for it to evolve. Some planets around K-type main-sequence stars are potential candidates for extraterrestrial life.
Habitable zone
A K-type star's habitable zone approximately ranges between 0.1–0.4 to 0.3–1.3 AU from the star. Here, exoplanets will receive only a relatively small amount of ultraviolet radiation, especially so towards the outer edge. This is favorable to support life, as it means that there is enough radiated energy to allow liquid water to exist on the surface, but not so much, especially ionizing radiation, as to destroy life.
The habitable zone is also very stable, lasting for most of the K-type main-sequence star's main sequence phase and with little instability of luminosity during that phase.
Potentially habitable planets around K-type main-sequence stars
The super-Earth HD 40307 g around the K2.5V star HD 40307 orbits in the CHZ, although it has a reasonably elliptical orbit (e=0.22). There may be many more, and the Kepler space telescope (now retired) was one of the main sources of information of these exoplanets. Kepler-62 and Kepler-442 are examples of discoveries by Kepler of systems consisting of a K-type dwarf with potentially habitable planets orbiting it. A super-Earth orbiting a K-type main-sequence star called HD 85512 b was originally thought to have habitability potential, but it is now considered too hot to be potentially habitable.

Robert Patterson (1863–1931) was an Irish naturalist. They were the son of Richard Patterson, the grandson of Robert Patterson FRS and the nephew of Robert Lloyd Patterson (1836-1906).
Robert Patterson was interested in every branch of natural history but mainly birds. They were a member of the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society and the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club and a founder of the Ulster Fisheries and Marine Biology Association. They also founded the People's Palace, or Patterson Museum, in Belfast which opened in 1904. This was a natural history (mainly birds) and archaeological museum intended for the free instruction of the people.

The Council of Alberta University Students (CAUS) represents the interests of over 140,000 Alberta university students across Alberta.
They represent undergraduate students from the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge, Athabasca University, Mount Royal University, and MacEwan University to the public, government and other post-secondary education stakeholders. Based in Edmonton, CAUS is a non-partisan and active advocacy group looking to ensure a fully accessible and high quality system of education in Alberta.
History
The Council of Alberta University Students (CAUS) was created in 1986 after the disintegration of the Federation of Alberta Students (FAS). FAS was a provincial umbrella organization that represented all of the public post-secondary institutions in Alberta; the organization fell apart in 1981 when a number of colleges and technical institutes withdrew their membership from the organization because they felt that the universities dominated the Federation. Out of the ashes of the FAS emerged CAUS, which included all of the publicly funded universities in Alberta, and ACTISEC (Alberta Colleges and Technical Institutes Student Executive Council), which represented all of the publicly funded colleges and technical institutes and later became the Alberta Students' Executive Council (ASEC).
The original purpose of CAUS was to facilitate information sharing and networking between university students' unions and associations. Since then, the emphasis of the organization has gone from being a networking group to an active lobbying and advocacy coalition.
In 2014, the student associations of Mount Royal University and MacEwan University became CAUS members, bringing the membership to five. In 2020, the Athabasca University Student Union became the sixth member.

In cell biology, focal adhesions (also cell–matrix adhesions or FAs) are large macromolecular assemblies through which mechanical force and regulatory signals are transmitted between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and an interacting cell. More precisely, focal adhesions are the sub-cellular structures that mediate the regulatory effects (i.e., signaling events) of a cell in response to ECM adhesion.
Focal adhesions serve as the mechanical linkages to the ECM, and as a biochemical signaling hub to concentrate and direct numerous signaling proteins at sites of integrin binding and clustering.
Structure and function
Focal adhesions are integrin-containing, multi-protein structures that form mechanical links between intracellular actin bundles and the extracellular substrate in many cell types. Focal adhesions are large, dynamic protein complexes through which the cytoskeleton of a cell connects to the ECM. They are limited to clearly defined ranges of the cell, at which the plasma membrane closes to within 15 nm of the ECM substrate. Focal adhesions are in a state of constant flux: proteins associate and disassociate with it continually as signals are transmitted to other parts of the cell, relating to anything from cell motility to cell cycle. Focal adhesions can contain over 100 different proteins, which suggests a considerable functional diversity. More than anchoring the cell, they function as signal carriers (sensors), which inform the cell about the condition of the ECM and thus affect their behavior. In sessile cells, focal adhesions are quite stable under normal conditions, while in moving cells their stability is diminished: this is because in motile cells, focal adhesions are being constantly assembled and disassembled as the cell establishes new contacts at the leading edge, and breaks old contacts at the trailing edge of the cell. One example of their important role is in the immune system, in which white blood cells migrate along the connective endothelium following cellular signals to damaged biological tissue.
Morphology
Connection between focal adhesions and proteins of the extracellular matrix generally involves integrins. Integrins bind to extra-cellular proteins via short amino acid sequences, such as the RGD motif (found in proteins such as fibronectin, laminin, or vitronectin), or the DGEA and GFOGER motifs found in collagen. Integrins are heterodimers which are formed from one beta and one alpha subunit. These subunits are present in different forms, their corresponding ligands classify these receptors into four groups: RGD receptors, laminin receptors, leukocyte-specific receptors and collagen receptors. Within the cell, the intracellular domain of integrin binds to the cytoskeleton via adapter proteins such as talin, α-actinin, filamin, vinculin and tensin. Many other intracellular signalling proteins, such as focal adhesion kinase, bind to and associate with this integrin-adapter protein–cytoskeleton complex, and this forms the basis of a focal adhesion.
Adhesion dynamics with migrating cells
The dynamic assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions plays a central role in cell migration. During cell migration, both the composition and the morphology of the focal adhesion change. Initially, small (0.25μm²) focal adhesions called focal complexes (FXs) are formed at the leading edge of the cell in lamellipodia: they consist of integrin, and some of the adapter proteins, such as talin, paxillin and tensin. Many of these focal complexes fail to mature and are disassembled as the lamellipodia withdraw. However, some focal complexes mature into larger and stable focal adhesions, and recruit many more proteins such as zyxin. Recruitment of components to the focal adhesion occurs in an ordered, sequential manner. Once in place, a focal adhesion remains stationary with respect to the extracellular matrix, and the cell uses this as an anchor on which it can push or pull itself over the ECM. As the cell progresses along its chosen path, a given focal adhesion moves closer and closer to the trailing edge of the cell. At the trailing edge of the cell the focal adhesion must be dissolved. The mechanism of this is poorly understood and is probably instigated by a variety of different methods depending on the circumstances of the cell. One possibility is that the calcium-dependent protease calpain is involved: it has been shown that the inhibition of calpain leads to the inhibition of focal adhesion-ECM separation. Focal adhesion components are amongst the known calpain substrates, and it is possible that calpain degrades these components to aid in focal adhesion disassembly
Actin retrograde flow
The assembly of nascent focal adhesions is highly dependent on the process of retrograde actin flow. This is the phenomenon in a migrating cell where actin filaments polymerize at the leading edge and flow back towards the cell body. This is the source of traction required for migration; the focal adhesion acts as a molecular clutch when it tethers to the ECM and impedes the retrograde movement of actin, thus generating the pulling (traction) force at the site of the adhesion that is necessary for the cell to move forward. This traction can be visualized with traction force microscopy. A common metaphor to explain actin retrograde flow is a large number of people being washed downriver, and as they do so, some of them hang on to rocks and branches along the bank to stop their downriver motion. Thus, a pulling force is generated onto the rock or branch that they are hanging on to. These forces are necessary for the successful assembly, growth, and maturation of focal adhesions.
Natural biomechanical sensor
Extracellular mechanical forces, which are exerted through focal adhesions, can activate Src kinase and stimulate the growth of the adhesions. This indicates that focal adhesions may function as mechanical sensors, and suggests that force generated from myosin fibers could contribute to maturing the focal complexes.
This gains further support from the fact that inhibition of myosin-generated forces leads to slow disassembly of focal adhesions, by changing the turnover kinetics of the focal adhesion proteins.
The relationship between forces on focal adhesions and their compositional maturation, however, remains unclear. For instance, preventing focal adhesion maturation by inhibiting myosin activity or stress fiber assembly does not prevent forces sustained by focal adhesions, nor does it prevent cells from migrating. Thus force propagation through focal adhesions may not be sensed directly by cells at all time and force scales.
Their role in mechanosensing is important for durotaxis.

Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy (, abbr.: HPMU) is a public university established in September 1979 in Haiphong, Vietnam. The university enrolls 450 full time students (each studying for 6 years) and 200 connected students (4 years) annually. Practice hospitals (with around 5,000 patient beds) are provided for students as medical facilities in Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Hai Duong.
History
In 1979, Ha Noi Medical University established a campus in Haiphong. Later in 1985, this same campus was styled as University Branch of Hai Phong Medical University, which came under the Ha Noi Medical University.
In 2006, the Minister of Health approved the development strategy of Hai Phong Medical University to be the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Hai Phong, adding new faculties: the faculty of pharmacy, the faculty of odonto-stomatology, the faculty of public health and the faculty of nursing, the faculty of medical technology.
Faculties
The Faculty of Fundamental Science teaches Medical Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Genetics, Mathematics, Informatics, Foreign Physical Education, National Defense Education, Languages and Political Theory.
One of the oldest facultys, the Faculty of Traditional Medicine has existed since 1979, while the Faculty of Public Health and the Faculty of Dentistry were both founded in 2009.
The Faculty of Nursing used to be part of Department of Fundamental Nursing, which in 2005, first admitted students to the nursing undergraduate training program. Several new faculties were established in the next few years, namely: the Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical Technology and Maritime Medicine were founded in 2011, 2012 and 2015 respectively.

Van der Nootska Palace () is a palace located at Sankt Paulsgatan 21 in Södermalm, Stockholm, Sweden.
The house was built in 1671-1672 by architect Mathias Spieler for the Dutch-born Swedish military officer Thomas van der Noot. The facade has pilasters and festoons and the middle part is decorated with mermaids in the sandstone. Two wings frame a small garden. The building was first used as a residence for various Dutch ministers. In 1740, a second building was erected that was used as a church for the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1770 it was made into a tobacco factory. In the late 19th century the building was in disrepair and was threatened with demolition.
The house was saved by Jean Jahnsson, owner of C.G. Hallberg, who turned it into a private residence. Architects for the renovation and expansion in 1903-1910 were IG Clason and Agi Lindegren. Jahnsson gathered a rich collection at the palace, including mainly Swedish silverware, a collection of hundreds of spoons from the 15th century onwards, porcelain, an unmatched collection of precious bejeweled gold boxes, Swedish miniatures, art furniture, Swedish engraving portraits and a library about much more than 100,000 volumes, including nearly complete collections of Swedish dramatic literature and Reformation writings, Swedish history books and documents etc. Jahnsson was hit hard by the Kreuger crash in the early 1930s, in which they were stripped of their wealth and forced to leave the Van der Nootska Palace and auction off most of the collections. Stensund Castle was sold to Carl Matthiessen, 1933, and the weapons collection auctioned off . The remainder of Jahnsson's collections from Van der Nootska, which mainly consisted of the Stockholmiana Collection, were donated in 1942 to the Stockholm City Museum of Axel Wenner-Gren, who in February 1938, had bought the Van der Nootska Palace. The Stockholmiana Collection consisted of about 5000 images and about 3000 books and pamphlets.
From 1940 the building was used by Sweden's Lotta unions who used it as a headquarters. In 1943, the building was renovated by architect Rolf Engstrom. Since 1988, the building has been used primarily for conferences and banqueting and is now owned by the City of Stockholm.

A district in Zimbabwe, Masvingo Province
Chiredzi found in the district, is one of a number of centers for HIV/AIDS treatment in the province. The district's Hippo Valley Hospital is one of a number of centers for HIV/AIDS treatment in the province. The district is famous for hosting Hippo Valley Estate and the nearby Mkwasine Estate, both of which specialize in sugar cane and citrus fruit production.
Geography
A large chunk of the district is found in region V, although there are some parts that lie in region IV. Areas in region five are characterized by aridity and uncertain rainfall patterns. Many parts of the district are unfit for agriculture, hence in 1972 they set aside to form Gonarezhou National Park. In terms of surface area, Chiredzi is one of the largest districts in the country with over 95% of its area taken up by Gonarenzou and other conservancies like Malilangwe. With the arid climate, most people grow sorghum, a crop which is drought-tolerant and requires minimal rain to grow to maturity. The red soil found in the district is also suitable for sugarcane, and prior to the land invasions of 2000, the district was a center for sugar production for the whole country.
Population
The district is sparsely populated. The Shangaan/Tsonga people are in the majority, and the predominant language is Shangaan, a dialect that is related to both Zulu and Ndebele.
Government and politics
For the general elections of 2008, Chiredzi District has been divided into four sectors. Candidates from the MDC-T, MDC-M, ZANU-PF and independents would have competed for the four constituency seats available, and the winners would have represented the district in Zimbabwe's new House of Assembly. For the Chiredzi East Sector, Mafamu Dennis (PAFA), Sithole Abraham (Zanu-PF), Chingombe Samson (MDC Mtambara), Chiromo Walter (MDC Tsvangirai) were registered to contest the seat, while Tafamba Olivia (PAFA), Ndava Ronald (Zanu-PF), and Mutambu John (MDC Tsvangirai) would have contested Chiredzi North. Baloyi Alois (Zanu-PF), Zanamwe Nehemiah (MDC), Chirove Joseph (MDC Tsvangirai) vied for Chiredzi South, while Musareva Ernest (PAFA), Samson Aliginia (Zanu-PF), Mungwadzi Godfrey (Independent), Mashiri Robson (MDC Mutambara), and nickrd) would have fought it out for Chiredzi West.

Alex Twal (born 3 July 1996) is a Lebanese international rugby league footballer who plays as a prop and for the Wests Tigers in the NRL.
Background
Twal was born in Westmead, New South Wales, Australia. They attended Parramatta Marist High School.
Playing career
Early career
A Parramatta City Titans junior, Twal played in the Holden Cup for the Parramatta Eels and was part of their extended first grade squad in 2015 and 2016. They played for the New South Wales under-20s and the Junior Kangaroos in both 2015 and 2016.
2017
Twal signed for the Wests Tigers midway through the 2017 season, from 2018 the end of 2020, before being granted an early release from Parramatta mid-season. They made their first grade debut on 2 July, one day before their 21st birthday, and played in the Tigers remaining eight games for the season, "putting in some seriously consistent performances off the bench." With 249 tackles made and only 5 missed, Twal had the best tackle percentage in the NRL over the regular season.
At season's end, Twal was selected for Lebanon in the World Cup. Teammate Tim Mannah said, "He reminds me of Nathan Brown where their personality is huge, and he's a player players love to play with. They bring a lot to a team. The Tigers are lucky to have him. He'll have a really strong career in the NRL." Coach Brad Fittler added, "He plays big minutes for a front-rower, they have a great work ethic, he's a top kid." After the pool rounds, they were leading the competition in tackles made.
2018
Twal made 21 appearances for Wests in 2018 as the club finished 9th on the table at the end of the regular season and missed out on the finals. They again led the competition with their effective tackle percentage.
2019
After round 17, Twal was rated as the 3rd hardest working player in the NRL. It was said, "Twal continues to keep producing in frightening statistics that continue to improve. The Lebanon international hasn't missed a single tackle since round 10 of the competition."
Twal made 24 appearances for Wests in the 2019 NRL season as the club finished ninth on the table and missed out on the finals. The club went into the final game of the season knowing that a win over Cronulla would guarantee themselves a finals place but they were defeated 25-8 at Leichhardt Oval.
On 19 November, Twal signed a two-year contract extension to stay with the club until the end of the 2022 season.
2020
Twal played 12 games for Wests in the 2020 NRL season as the club missed out on the finals by finishing 11th.
2021
Twal played a total of 23 games for the Wests Tigers in the 2021 NRL season as the club finished 13th and missed the finals.
2022
On 16 July, Twal was ruled out for the remainder of the 2022 NRL season due to three concussions they sustained throughout the year.

Rink Point () is a rocky point on the northwest coast of James Ross Island, 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) east of Carlson Island. The name arose because, during a visit by a Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) party in August 1952, the point was surrounded by a large area of slippery, snow-free sea ice resembling a skating rink.

The River Eitha () is a small river in Wrexham County Borough, Wales. It is part of the River Dee catchment. Its name was probably derived from the Welsh word eithaf - "extremity", "farthest".
Sir Cyril Fox, in their surveys of Offa's Dyke and Wat's Dyke, identified a section of the Eitha as forming part of the frontier of Mercia in this area.
Course
The river rises, as the Trefechan Brook, high on the Ruabon Moors in the area known as Newtown Mountain, before flowing through a rather steep valley to two reservoirs above Penycae. At this point it is an important feeder for Dee Valley Water, formerly Wrexham Water. At Penycae, it is joined by the Nant y Crogfyn stream, which also flows down from the slopes of Ruabon Mountain. The Eitha's course then runs south-eastwards to Ruabon, where it was formerly used to power several watermills, passing through the centre of the village. From Ruabon the Eitha passes southwards through a deep, wooded valley within the Wynnstay Estate to join the River Dee near Chirk.

In medicine, distress is an aversive state in which a person is unable to completely adapt to stressors and their resulting stress and shows maladaptive behaviors. It can be evident in the presence of various phenomena, such as inappropriate social interaction (e.g., aggression, passivity, or withdrawal).
Distress is the opposite of eustress, a positive stress that motivates people.
Risk factors
Stress can be created by influences such as work, school, peers or co-workers, family and death. Other influences vary by age.
People under constant distress are more likely to become sick, mentally or physically. There is a clear response association between psychological distress and major causes of mortality across the full range of distress.
Higher education has been linked to a reduction in psychological distress in both men and women, and these effects persist throughout the aging process, not just immediately after receiving education. However, this link does lessen with age. The major mechanism by which higher education plays a role on reducing stress in men is more so related to labor-market resources rather than social resources as in women.
In the clinic, distress is a patient reported outcome that has a huge impact on patient's quality of life. To assess patient distress, a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire is most commonly used. The score from the HADS questionnaire guides a clinician to recommend lifestyle modifications or further assessment for mental disorders like depression.
Management
People often find ways of dealing with distress, in both negative and positive ways. Examples of positive ways are listening to music, calming exercises, coloring, sports and similar healthy distractions. Negative ways can include but are not limited to use of drugs including alcohol, and expression of anger, which are likely to lead to complicated social interactions, thus causing increased distress.

All Rise is the second full-length album recorded by Chicago post-hardcore band Naked Raygun in 1985 and released on LP by Homestead Records in 1986. When Quarterstick Records re-released all of Naked Raygun's early albums in the late 90s, two bonus tracks were added to the CD album.
All Rise is the first Naked Raygun album to feature Pierre Kezdy on bass and Eric Spicer on drums, though all of the album's songs had been written by vocalist Jeff Pezzati and guitarist John Haggerty before Kezdy and Spicer joined the band. At least one song, "New Dreams", was written during earlier incarnations of the band and a live version appears as a bonus track to the band's Basement Screams EP from 1983.

The branchlets are rarely glabrous and more often sparsely to moderately pubescent with spreading, straight hairs. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The thin grey-green phyllodes look crowded on their stem projections and usually have an inequilaterally narrowly elliptic to oblong-oblanceolate shape. They are in length and wide and are glabrous except few marginal hairs near base. The racemose inflorescences are aggregated in the upper axils and have sperical flower-heads containing 15 to 20 golden flowers. The glabrous and firmly chartaceous seed pods that form after flowering are linear to shallowly curved with a length of up to and a width of . The shiny blacks seeds are arranged longitudinally inside the pods with an oblong shape and a length of .
Distribution
It is endemic only in a small area in south eastern Queensland from around Knockbreak Station in the north to near Stanthorpe in the south where it is found on low rocky hills growing in sandy-loamy soils as a part of open Eucalyptus woodland communities.

Isabeau is a leggenda drammatica or opera in three parts by Pietro Mascagni, 1911, from an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica. Mascagni conducted its first performance on 2 June 1911 at the Teatro Coliseo, Buenos Aires.
A retelling of the medieval English legend of Lady Godiva, Mascagni described it in an interview as their attempt to "return to the romanticism which inspired so much of Italian opera."
Roles
Synopsis
King Raimondo tries to find a husband for the princess Isabeau by holding a tournament, but they are unwilling to choose a husband. When the king forces them to ride naked through the city, the people refuse to look at them out of respect. Furthermore, they demand from the king an edict condemning to blindness anyone who dares to look at them Unaware of the edict, the falconer Folco accidentally looks upon Isabeau during their ride and is arrested. When Isabeau visits them in prison, they fall in love with them and begs their father to pardon him. However, the king's minister stirs up the passions of the people who rise up in a vigilante mob and kill Folco. Isabeau kills themselves over their dying body.

Villa Bernasconi is a typical example of an independent villa with a turret in the Art Nouveau style. Located in Cernobbio, it was commissioned by the textile manufacturer Davide Bernasconi to the Milanese architect Alfredo Campanini.
History
Bernasconi founded their factory, later known as Tessiture Bernasconi (Bernasconi Textile Mills) in 1876. It started out as a small textile mill with only 40 looms. In 1906, it had grown to 560 looms and new plants had been opened or acquired in the towns of Cantello, Solbiate, Maccio, Giussano, Cagno, Figliaro. The enlargement of the Cernobbio factory took up a vast area at the center of the town, turning it into a typical model village. Beside the mill, it included housing for workmen and clerks, the owner's residence and a kindergarten. Bernasconi decided to leave their old mansion (close to the factory and currently hosting the municipal offices) to their son and to build themselves a new one. The villa would stand as a symbol of their commercial success and embody the taste in fashion, the affluence and the optimistic outlook of the era. It was built close to the town center, on a lot adjoining the family's silk mills, and completed in 1906. In the same years, Milan was busy preparing the Universal Exhibition which would celebrate the opening of the Simplon tunnel. The Villa belonged to the heirs of the Bernasconi family until 1955. After that, it was sold to a local transport company, which in turn rented it to the local Guardia di Finanza. In 1989, it was bought by the Town of Cernobbio, which funded several restoration interventions, starting in 1995.
The villa hosts the first permanent talking museum devoted to Art Nouveau and to the Bernasconi family, inaugurated in 2017.
Description
Villa Bernasconi is a two-storey, open-space villa with a basement floor and a turret. The building has two entrances. The main entrance, on the east façade, has steps leading to a veranda with a metal framework and multicolour decorations. The veranda opens on the central, square hall and the main stairway. The second entrance, on the south façade, leads to a curved loggia/ balcony which in turn opens on the reception room. The main compositional element is the central stairwell, which rises beyond the upper floor and turns into a panoramic turret.
Exterior decoration
Campanini themselves designed every single decorative element down to the smallest detail, with a harmonious integration of materials and shapes. They also coordinated the work of highly skilled craftsmen. The façade is embellished by hammered and carved concrete plaster decorations, imitating large blocks. Every architectural element is adorned with larger than life sculpted depictions of a silkworm's life cycle - silkworms, mulberry leaves, flowers and berries, and butterflies.
The building is also ornamented with several different ceramic tile friezes, depicting flowers and stylized vegetable elements in strongly contrasting colours. The higher frieze represents silkworm butterflies, while under the eaves we can find single tile inserts with white petals (possibly magnolias') on a blue background. Lower down, we have smaller bands of ceramic tiles with a leaf motif. On top of the windows, we find other blue tile inserts with lily-shaped white flowers with pointed petals.
The wrought iron elements are probably the result of a collaboration between Campanini and Alessandro Mazzucotelli. This hypothesis is corroborated by some preliminary sketches for the architect's own home, found in Mazzucotelli's archive, by the high quality of the Villa's decorative elements, and by their affinities with contemporary works by the artist. Villa Bernasconi has many wrought iron fixtures (the fence, the banisters, the balcony railings, some window frames) in a plethora of different motifs: wide, fleshy leaves, Secession-style graphic elements for the backstairs banisters, roses and tendrils for the main staircase.
Interiors
Like the exterior, the interior is in the Art Nouveau style. The main stairwell is dominated by a three section stained glass wall that lets light and colour in. The figurative portion of the design is made up of small coloured glass panels held together by a metal framework. The walls are decorated with painted naturalistic motifs. The wooden fixtures, the accurately shaped doors and windows, the exquisite design of the handles (which is different in the public rooms and the servants' quarters) all express a strong coherence in both design and execution, with a harmonious fusion of structure and ornament.
Unfortunately, nothing is left of the original furniture, save for a marble column with a potted palm, now standing in the veranda of the main entrance.
