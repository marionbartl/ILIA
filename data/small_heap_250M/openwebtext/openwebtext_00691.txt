Many people have wanted to make the process of side-loading much simpler, I'm talking drag and drop APK installs simple, well want no more. Until something better comes along, which there is, I made a batch file that will let you drag and drop APK files onto it and install them onto your OUYA.
What is needed
ADB must be installed and part of your environment
You must have networked ADB enabled on your OUYA, for a way to permanently enable it check out these two posts. ReRoot Your OUYA Always On Network ADB
Copy the script below into a batch file, “Install on OUYA.bat” would be a good name!
Install on OUYA.bat
@ECHO OFF ECHO Installing "%~1" adb connect OUYAIPHERE adb install -r "%~1" pause
*Don't forget to replace OUYAIPHERE with the IP Address of your OUYA.
Download Install on OUYA.bat
Tada!
Once you have these steps done you will have an icon on your desktop called “Install on OUYA.bat” , which you can drag and drop APKs onto and have them install on your OUYA.

Hacker ‘Guccifer 2.0' has offered support for allegations that Democrats rewarded big donors and fund-raisers with plum diplomatic posts, by releasing a donor list from November 2008, when current VP candidate Tim Kaine chaired the DNC.
Among the 500 megabytes of data released Tuesday was the document titled “11-26-08 NFC Members Raised,” listing the names and addresses of some 100,000 Democratic National Committee donors. Cross-referencing the top donors' names revealed that they were later appointed to ambassador posts and other government jobs.
A third or more of US ambassadors are not career diplomats but political appointees. President Barack Obama came under criticism in 2013 after appointing several big campaign donors to prestigious diplomatic posts. Most recently the US ambassador to Hungary made headlines with some rather un-diplomatic remarks; Caroline Bell had been a TV producer before raising $2 million for the DNC.

Matthew Barzun, who raised a total of $3.5 million, became an ambassador to Sweden (2009-2011), and is currently the US ambassador to the UK.
Kirk Wagar raised a total of $2.3 million, and was appointed US ambassador to Singapore in 2013.
The US ambassador to Spain and Andorra from 2009 to 2013 was Alan Solomont, who raised $2.3 million.
John Roos raised just over $2 million, and served as the US ambassador to Japan from 2009 to 2013.
Bruce Oreck contributed $1.13 million, and was US ambassador to Finland from 2009 to 2015.
Robert Mandell raised $1.12 million, and became the US ambassador to Luxembourg in June 2011; he served until 2015.
After donating $605,000, Jane Hartley became the US ambassador to France and Monaco in 2014.
Big donors were also appointed as ambassadors to the Bahamas, Switzerland, South Africa, Belgium, New Zealand and the Czech Republic, the documents reveal.
Pamela Hamamoto contributed $605,000. In May 2014, she became the US permanent representative to the UN in Geneva.
Crystal Nix-Hines gave $600,000, and was confirmed by the Senate in June 2014 to serve as US permanent representative to UNESCO.

The documents cover a period between 2009 and 2011, when the DNC was chaired by Tim Kaine, currently Hillary Clinton's running mate on the presidential ticket.
“The DNC is the victim of a crime — an illegal cyber-attack by Russian state-sponsored agents who seek to harm the Democratic Party and progressive groups in an effort to influence the presidential election," Interim Chair Donna Brazile said in a statement Tuesday. She added that the party's legal team was reviewing the documents to confirm their authenticity, “as it is common for Russian hackers to forge documents.”
The hacker who released the files says he acted alone and has denied any connection to the Russian government. His moniker, ‘Guccifer 2.0', is a nod to the Romanian national whose amateur exploits in 2013 revealed Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she served as the US secretary of state.
The Security Cabinet approved a limited call-up of reserve soldiers as preparations for a possible US strike on Syria and retaliation against Israel intensified on Wednesday afternoon.
The call-up, already under way Wednesday, was mainly for personnel from Home Front Command and the IAF's Active Defense wing, charged with defending the country from rocket-fire and aerial incursions.
“The cabinet approved the call-up for several thousand reservists; the IDF has so far chosen only to call up a few hundred,” a military source told the Times of Israel.

In all, some 1,000 troops were being called up, to staff missile defense systems, strengthen Home Front Command operations, and bolster some intelligence units, security sources said.
The cabinet met for five hours, and heard briefings about the likely developments concerning an imminent US-led attack on Syria, in response to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons in attacks that killed hundreds of Syrians last Wednesday. Security chiefs told ministers they assessed as low the likelihood of Syria striking at Israel in retaliation for a US attack. On Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Israel would respond forcefully to any Syrian threat. On Wednesday, he was quoted encouraging Israelis to maintain their normal routine.
Hebrew media have reported that the US would inform Israel ahead of a US-led strike.
Israeli officials asked residents to keep calm and stick to their normal routines despite threats emanating from Damascus.
“We are getting ready and are prepared, but there is no panic,” Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said Wednesday while speaking at a Tel Aviv economic conference. “The Syrians have crossed a red line set by the Americans. We are not dealing with this issue, the West and the Unites States are,” he added.
The limited call up came hours after the IDF was reported to have deployed additional Iron Dome batteries, Arrow short-range rocket defense systems and Patriot missile-defense batteries in the north and areas near the Syrian border.
With the US threatening to attack Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons, Israel fears that Syria may respond with an attack on Israel, though officially the army estimates that Damascus will not bomb Israel.
“The Middle East, in the near future, will be characterized by a chronic instability,” the defense minister said in Tel Aviv. “However, our borders are stable despite isolated incidents. Our responses illustrate our own red lines and are based on deterrence.”

The director of the eagerly anticipated blockbuster Thor Ragnarok, the third feature film in Marvel's Thor franchise, says he made the hiring of Indigenous crew in Australia a priority.

“It's a responsibility you have to the Indigenous people. You're coming to a country and you're bringing money into the economy and creating jobs but I think you have an even bigger responsibility to look after the people that have fewer opportunities,” director Taika Waititi told BuzzFeed News from the film's Queensland set.
Waititi, who is of Māori descent, said that he made it clear to producers from the beginning that he wanted Indigenous people working on the film. "I was exploring the idea from the moment I got to LA, telling the producers at Marvel and they were fully onboard with it. We got a few attachments and it's really cool. We've got them all throughout different departments and I feel quite good about it," Waititi said.

On the first day of filming, the Yugambeh people, who are the traditional owners from the Gold Coast where the Warner Brother's backlot is situated, performed a welcome to country ceremony. The production has also contracted an Aboriginal company to supply water to the set. There are eight Aboriginal people working on the film in different areas including directing, stunts, set design and production and grips.
Supplied. Producer and writer Kodie Bedford is working in the stunts department.
Cinematographer Cornel Ozies and award-winning actor Shari Sebbens are working directly with Waititi, and Jaru producer and writer, Kodie Bedford, is working in the stunts department. "We are finding those new talents and giving them an experience not many people have. I mean, I am 40 and this is my first experience on a set like this and giving that experience to young native people is invaluable and a really cool experience," he said.
The attachments are part of an initiative by Screen Australia's Indigenous Department to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders a foot in the door of the film industry. One of the former participants in the scheme is Ryan Griffen who went on to create the acclaimed television series Cleverman.
"We are enormously proud of the talent and ambition of this cohort. From an attachment comes practical and hands-on experience, invaluable networking and the opportunity to forge a sustainable career in the industry," Penny Smallacombe, head of the Indigenous department at Screen Australia, said.
Waititi, whose previous films include Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, is the first Indigenous person to direct a Marvel superhero film and says having Māori, Aboriginal Australians and New Zealanders on set has helped his nerves. "All of my Aboriginal friends feel very much like family, and for me it's such a weird and new thing for me to work on a Hollywood film. Having Indigenous people and New Zealanders in the crew helps calm me down and makes me feel relaxed," Waititi said.
Rhombodera basalis) showing the black pseudopupil in its compound eyes. Close up image of a mantis' face () showing the black pseudopupil in its compound eyes.
The eye of a mantis shrimp has three regions, each with its own pseudopupil.
In the compound eye of invertebrates such as insects and crustaceans, the pseudopupil appears as a dark spot which moves across the eye as the animal is rotated.[1] This occurs because the ommatidia that one observes "head-on" (along their optical axes) absorb the incident light, while those to one side reflect it.[2] The pseudopupil therefore reveals which ommatidia are aligned with the axis along which the observer is viewing.[2]
Pseudopupil Analysis Technique [ edit ]
The pseudopupil analysis technique is used to study neurodegeneration in insects like Drosophila. It is especially useful for study of neurodegenerative diseases. An adult Drosophila eye consists of nearly 800 unit ommatidia which are repeated in a symmetrical pattern. Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells each of which forms a rhabdomere (7 and 8 rhabdomeres are overlapping therefore, only 7 are visible at any given plain focus). Neurodegeneration leads to loss or degradation of photoreceptors [3]. By visualising and counting the intact rhabdomeres, degradation level can be measured. Thus, using analysing pseudopupil, one can study neurodegeneration.

MILAN (Reuters) - A group of students stormed Goldman Sachs's central Milan offices on Friday ahead of worldwide protests against financial inequality planned for the weekend.
The Italian demonstrations are the latest bout of anger at banks and financiers as outcry spreads throughout the world following the occupation of Wall Street in New York by protesters over the past month.
Students managed to break into the hall of the Goldman Sachs building in the heart of Milan's financial district, a few steps away from La Scala opera house, police said.
The protests were quickly dispersed by police and security was restored to the elegant building, though red graffiti was daubed on its walls expressing anger at Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and proclaiming “Give us money.”
Protesters in Italy's financial capital also hurled eggs at the headquarters of UniCredit, the country's biggest bank.
As part of the global rally on Saturday, a demostration is scheduled to start at 1200 GMT (8 a.m. EDT) in Rome, where peaceful protests in front of the Bank of Italy continued on Friday for a third straight day.

Bridgeport, CT – DonTrell Brown is serious about exercising his rights, and he has recently had a series of run-ins with the law as a result. Brown does not drink, smoke or use profanity, but he takes a gun with him wherever he goes, and in the state where he lives open carrying is perfectly legal.
It is rare to see a person open-carrying their weapon in the state of Connecticut, but it is entirely legal, and according to the fine print of the law, a person is not required to show an officer their permit unless they are detained or were the victim of a crime. However, the police in Connecticut aren't entirely aware of this fact, and their internal memos state that police are entitled to force any type of information that they want out of people.
Brown holds a masters degree and is well-versed in legal matters, so he knows the boundaries of the law and has no problem testing those boundaries.
In the past few months, Brown had a number of different run-ins with police, but just this week he was harassed and followed around town by officers because he was carrying his legally owned firearm. Brown was pressured by the officers to show them his permit to carry, but he refused and cited the law that he was not required to show them anything unless he was suspected of a crime. Police claim that they were responding to a call from someone who was threatened by the fact that he had a weapon, however, in an exclusive interview with The Free Thought Project, Brown said that the officers were eating at the restaurant where the first encounter took place, meaning that they had just happened to run into him, and were not responding to a call.
Since he was correct about the law, Brown was not arrested by police, however, he was denied service at the Subway restaurant, which has a no gun policy. Unfortunately, the police were not done harassing Brown but decided to follow him around town to other locations. Brown continued to stand his ground and the situation was resolved peacefully when the cops finally backed off.
The day after the encounter, the video quickly went viral and sparked controversy in the local area about whether or not a gun owner was required to show a police officer their permit if they are asked for it. Police and government employees are unanimously in agreement that people should be required to give police any information that they ask for under any circumstances, however, if this were actually the law, then people like DonTrell would quickly be arrested for not showing officers their permits.
Brown tells the Free Thought Project that it is important for people to exercise their rights, because if people don't, then our freedom will disappear, which is why it is so important for him to open carry. He said that it is important for all gun owners to open carry, but that it was especially important for people of color, who are many times prevented from carrying or even owning firearms. He pointed out that some of the first gun laws in the country were put in place to prevent freed slaves from owning guns.
“What I did was not meant to cause any problems, just more to show people of color that people like MLK and Abraham Lincoln died for us (Black people) to have rights. So if we allow anyone just to violate them then their death's would be in vain. I for one am really thankful for everything they as well as others done for me to even be out of chain and shackles,” Brown said.
“I just want to be seen as an American with rights, not just a black man challenging the law,” he added.
The following videos show the encounters that Brown had this week with local police:

Bishop 'unfit to serve' after passport comment
Updated
The Federal Government says Opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Julie Bishop is unfit to serve in her portfolio after breaching a protocol on commenting about the possible use of forged passports by Australian spies.
Ms Bishop has been strongly critical of the Government's decision to expel an Israeli diplomat in retaliation for the use of forged Australian passports in the assassination of a Hamas leader.
When asked yesterday if she thought Australian intelligence agencies used fake passports she replied, "Yes", but later issued a statement in which she backed away from the comments.
The Government says Ms Bishop broke a longstanding convention not to talk about intelligence practices, and Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith has accused her of trying to cover up her mistake.
"What we now need to see today is ... Mr Abbott disavow her and come out strongly supporting the longstanding convention that we do not put our national security at risk by speaking, commenting or speculating about these matters," he told AM.
Mr Smith would not say whether Australia also forged passports.
Transport Minister Anthony Albanese says Ms Bishop is making too many errors.
"This is just the latest mistake of Julie Bishop and simply shows she is unfit to be the alternative foreign minister of this nation," he told Sky News.
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says he stands by his deputy.
"She's issued a statement, I think that statement makes things very clear," he told 2UE radio. "As she says in her statement, she misunderstood the question."
Australian National University global politics senior lecturer Michael McKinley has told Radio National Ms Bishop has adopted a position that is "untenable".
"She's received a briefing which implicates Israel in the falsification of Australian passports, then she has gone public with various claims or insinuations about what Australia does or does not do," he said.
"We're dealing with forged Australian passports which were used by a friend in a friendly country to assassinate one of their enemies.
"That gets into some very murky waters and Julie Bishop's attitude seems to be, 'Well, everybody does it, why are we carrying on like this?'"

You don't have to void your wallet of hard-earned cash when you want to pick up some good beer. If you happen to live near a Trader Joe's that sells beer (sorry Pennsylvania), then I have some suggestions for you to try.First off is the Mission St Anniversary Ales. They are brewed and bottled in 22 oz. bottles for Trader Joe's by Steinhaus Brewing Co, which is really Firestone Walker Brewing. They have been releasing a new Mission St. Anniversary each year for the last several years. From my memory, last year's Anniversary Ale was good, but 2014's release is great. Sweet caramel and dark fruits up front, with a burst of citrus at the end of each sip, on top of a layer of alcohol makes this beer incredibly tasty. And it only gets better with each sip as it warms. Steinhaus/Firestone classify this beer as an Imperial Brown Ale, and it comes in at a warming 8.5% abv. Oh, and the 22 oz. bottle was $2.99!There are other beers in the Mission St. line, includi…
We the People MUST carry Donald Trump across the finish line. He ain't heavy, he's our next president.
Patriots must carry Trump across the finish line
Patriots, to save our country, it has become clear that we must hoist Trump up on our shoulders and carry him across the finish line into the Oval Office. The mainstream media has blatantly joined crooked Hillary and her minions to brand Trump unfit to serve as president. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. I cannot stomach watching CNN. Almost every evening I am at my local gym on an aerobic machine working to keep my blood sugar numbers good. CNN is always on a few of the TV sets hanging from the ceiling. Reading headlines posted on the lower third of the screen with the sound turned down is quite revealing. It makes it plain to see CNN's relentless efforts to demonize and destroy Trump.
For example: The news that the father of the Pulse nightclub shooter was seated behind Hillary at her rally was not helpful to her campaign. A day or so later, CNN's lower third headline read, “Disgraced Congressman Sits Behind Trump at Rally.” This was CNN's attempt to defend Hillary by saying, see, a not-so-good person was seated behind Trump at his rally. I have seen numerous lower third graphics on CNN purposed to portray Trump as a racist and a nut case (standard Leftist tactics to silence and destroy). The other night at my gym, the CNN lower graphic read, “Breaking News: Confederate Flag at Trump Rally Tonight.” Do you see what CNN was attempting do? CNN, along with most of the mainstream media are Hillary operatives disguised as news outlets. CNN wanted to convey the message that a Confederate flag at a Trump rally means Trump and his supporters are rabid racists. Leftists are divisive, dishonest and evil folks. Leftists do not care if they stir-up racial hate as long as it generates enough racial division, hate and fear to cause duped voters to vote for Democrats. I hate that Leftists continue to successfully dupe the masses into perceiving them as paragons of compassion. In reality, the Democratic Party (Leftists) is the birthplace and is still the home of racism. Leftists are the polar opposite of true compassion. Folks, we have seen Leftists use this tactic from their “How To Make Patriots Abandon Their Heroes” playbook before. We (patriots) prayed for a hero to come along and push-back against political correctness; someone who would courageously and boldly defend and fight to preserve traditional values that have made America great and exceptional. Our prayers were answered in the form of a beautiful woman named Sarah Palin. I was touring on Tea Party Express back then. I witnessed first hand the massive crowds and excitement whenever Palin spoke at our rallies. Fearing Palin's power, the Left launched a shock-and-awe, 24/7, no-holds-barred campaign to destroy Palin. I expected the Left to trash Palin. However, it turned my stomach the way many conservatives abandoned her when she failed to walk on water.
We are in the midst of Hillary and her operatives using the same tactics they used against our strong advocate Palin to take out our strong advocate Trump. Hillary and company seek to brand Trump so toxic and crazy that Republicans and conservatives will run to the tall grass out-of-range of the Left's bombings of him. Folks, we cannot allow that to happen. When one of my brothers parroted Hillary's rhetoric about Trump, I lovingly laid into him, setting him straight; telling him he must vote for Trump. A relative told my wife Mary she dislikes both candidates and was going to write in “Mickey Mouse.” Mary told her this is not a time to be cute. Mary explained to the relative that she must vote for Trump. This is what all who love America as founded must do this election. America cannot survive patriots pulling a “Palin” on Trump, abandoning him because of Hillary and company's smear campaign. Another way to help Trump is to host a Tea Party for Trump rally Sunday, August 28th. Tea Party for Trump will follow up the rallies with a massive, well-orchestrated, national get-out-the-vote campaign. It is truly repulsive hearing Hillary attempting to brand Trump unfit while she is the epitome of an unfit candidate. Even more disturbing is watching the Left (corrupt federal government, mainstream media and Hollywood) spin a cocoon-of-protection around her. Dinesh D'Souza's movie, “Hillary's America” exposes the Clinton's well documented history of deceit, corruption and criminal activity. D'Souza revealed that Hillary went from zero to $300 million on a government salary. That is impossible folks.
As a black American, it is insulting hearing Hillary pander and talk down to black audiences. Using her best colored people accent, Hillary spouted, “I don't feel no ways tired.” Hillary is a panderer. She panders around, around and around. Hillary told a black radio host that she carries hot sauce in her purse.” http://bit.ly/1MDRKBt Folks, it is time to vote this evil woman out of our lives. Patriots, we MUST carry Trump to victory. We can do these folks. Together, we have great power. I look back with fond memories of the 2010 rally to stop Obamacare. I sang at that rally. Despite a mainstream media blackout insidiously ignoring the protest rally, we got 1.7 million patriots to come to DC to protest Obamacare. We used word-of-mouth, social media and the internet. We the People MUST carry Donald Trump across the finish line. He ain't heavy, he's our next president.

Once upon a time we had legacy GRUB, the Grand Unified Linux Bootloader version 0.97. Legacy GRUB had many virtues, but it became old and its developers did yearn for more functionality, and thus did GRUB 2 come into the world.
GRUB 2 is a major rewrite with several significant differences. It boots removable media, and can be configured with an option to enter your system BIOS. It's more complicated to configure with all kinds of scripts to wade through, and instead of having a nice fairly simple /boot/grub/menu.lst file with all configurations in one place, the default is /boot/grub/grub.cfg . Which you don't edit directly, oh no, for this is not for mere humans to touch, but only other scripts. We lowly humans may edit /etc/default/grub , which controls mainly the appearance of the GRUB menu. We may also edit the scripts in /etc/grub.d/ . These are the scripts that boot your operating systems, control external applications such as memtest and os_prober , and theming. /boot/grub/grub.cfg is built from /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d/* when you run the update-grub command, which you must run every time you make changes.
The good news is that the update-grub script is reliable for finding kernels, boot files, and adding all operating systems to your GRUB boot menu, so you don't have to do it manually.
We're going to learn how to fix two of the more common failures. When you boot up your system and it stops at the grub> prompt, that is the full GRUB 2 command shell. That means GRUB 2 started normally and loaded the normal.mod module (and other modules which are located in /boot/grub/[arch]/ ), but it didn't find your grub.cfg file. If you see grub rescue> that means it couldn't find normal.mod , so it probably couldn't find any of your boot files.
How does this happen? The kernel might have changed drive assignments or you moved your hard drives, you changed some partitions, or installed a new operating system and moved things around. In these scenarios your boot files are still there, but GRUB can't find them. So you can look for your boot files at the GRUB prompt, set their locations, and then boot your system and fix your GRUB configuration.
GRUB 2 Command Shell
The GRUB 2 command shell is just as powerful as the shell in legacy GRUB. You can use it to discover boot images, kernels, and root filesystems. In fact, it gives you complete access to all filesystems on the local machine regardless of permissions or other protections. Which some might consider a security hole, but you know the old Unix dictum: whoever has physical access to the machine owns it.
When you're at the grub> prompt, you have a lot of functionality similar to any command shell such as history and tab-completion. The grub rescue> mode is more limited, with no history and no tab-completion.
If you are practicing on a functioning system, press C when your GRUB boot menu appears to open the GRUB command shell. You can stop the bootup countdown by scrolling up and down your menu entries with the arrow keys. It is safe to experiment at the GRUB command line because nothing you do there is permanent. If you are already staring at the grub> or grub rescue> prompt then you're ready to rock.
The next few commands work with both grub> and grub rescue> . The first command you should run invokes the pager, for paging long command outputs:
grub> set pager=1
There must be no spaces on either side of the equals sign. Now let's do a little exploring. Type ls to list all partitions that GRUB sees:
grub> ls (hd0) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos1)
What's all this msdos stuff ? That means this system has the old-style MS-DOS partition table, rather than the shiny new Globally Unique Identifiers partition table (GPT). (See Using the New GUID Partition Table in Linux (Goodbye Ancient MBR). If you're running GPT it will say (hd0,gpt1) . Now let's snoop. Use the ls command to see what files are on your system:
grub> ls (hd0,1)/ lost+found/ bin/ boot/ cdrom/ dev/ etc/ home/ lib/ lib64/ media/ mnt/ opt/ proc/ root/ run/ sbin/ srv/ sys/ tmp/ usr/ var/ vmlinuz vmlinuz.old initrd.img initrd.img.old
Hurrah, we have found the root filesystem. You can omit the msdos and gpt labels. If you leave off the slash it will print information about the partition. You can read any file on the system with the cat command:
grub> cat (hd0,1)/etc/issue Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
\l
Reading /etc/issue could be useful on a multi-boot system for identifying your various Linuxes.
Booting From grub>
This is how to set the boot files and boot the system from the grub> prompt. We know from running the ls command that there is a Linux root filesystem on (hd0,1) , and you can keep searching until you verify where /boot/grub is. Then run these commands, using your own root partition, kernel, and initrd image:
grub> set root=(hd0,1) grub> linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic root=/dev/sda1 grub> initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic grub> boot
The first line sets the partition that the root filesystem is on. The second line tells GRUB the location of the kernel you want to use. Start typing /boot/vmli , and then use tab-completion to fill in the rest. Type root=/dev/sdX to set the location of the root filesystem. Yes, this seems redundant, but if you leave this out you'll get a kernel panic. How do you know the correct partition? hd0,1 = /dev/sda1. hd1,1 = /dev/sdb1. hd3,2 = /dev/sdd2. I think you can extrapolate the rest.
The third line sets the initrd file, which must be the same version number as the kernel.
The fourth line boots your system.
On some Linux systems the current kernels and initrds are symlinked into the top level of the root filesystem:
$ ls -l / vmlinuz -> boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic initrd.img -> boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic
So you could boot from grub> like this:
grub> set root=(hd0,1) grub> linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda1 grub> initrd /initrd.img grub> boot
Booting From grub-rescue>
If you're in the GRUB rescue shell the commands are different, and you have to load the normal.mod and linux.mod modules:
grub rescue> set prefix=(hd0,1)/boot/grub grub rescue> set root=(hd0,1) grub rescue> insmod normal grub rescue> normal grub rescue> insmod linux grub rescue> linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic root=/dev/sda1 grub rescue> initrd /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic grub rescue> boot
Tab-completion should start working after you load both modules.
Making Permanent Repairs
When you have successfully booted your system, run these commands to fix GRUB permanently:
# update-grub Generating grub configuration file ... Found background: /usr/share/images/grub/Apollo_17_The_Last_Moon_Shot_Edit1.tga Found background image: /usr/share/images/grub/Apollo_17_The_Last_Moon_Shot_Edit1.tga Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-27-generic Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-27-generic Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-24-generic Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-24-generic Found memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.elf Found memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin done # grub-install /dev/sda Installing for i386-pc platform. Installation finished. No error reported.
When you run grub-install remember you're installing it to the boot sector of your hard drive and not to a partition, so do not use a partition number like /dev/sda1 .
But It Still Doesn't Work
If your system is so messed up that none of this works, try the Super GRUB2 live rescue disk. The official GNU GRUB Manual 2.00 should also be helpful.
It's the eternal question for pet owners: Does your dog understand what you're saying? Even if Fido doesn't “get” your words, surely he gets your tone when you let loose about another accident on the carpet. But a new imaging study shows that dogs' brains respond to actual words, not just the tone in which they're said. The study will likely shake up research into the origins of language, scientists say, as well as gratify dog lovers.
“It's an important study that shows that basic aspects of speech perception can be shared with quite distant relatives,” says Tecumseh Fitch, a cognitive biologist at the University of Vienna, who was not involved in the work.
Words, the basic building blocks of human languages, are seldom found among other species. Bottlenose dolphins and green-rumped parrotlets make sounds that function like names, and animals including chickens, prairie dogs, and some primates utter alarm calls that identify specific predators. Dogs don't produce words, but some are known to recognize more than 1000 human words—behavior that suggests they may attach meaning to human sounds. The new study shows that it is indeed the words themselves—and not the tone in which they're spoken or the context in which they're used—that dogs comprehend.
To find out how dogs process human speech, Attila Andics, a neuroscientist at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, and his colleagues used brain scanners and 13 willing family dogs from four breeds: border collies, golden retrievers, Chinese crested dogs, and German shepherds. The dogs had been trained to lie motionless in the scanner while they listened to recordings of their trainer's voice. The dogs heard meaningful words (“well done!” in Hungarian) in a praising tone and in a neutral tone. They also heard meaningless words (“as if”) in a neutral or praising tone of voice.
When the scientists analyzed the brain scans, they saw that—regardless of the trainer's intonation—the dogs processed the meaningful words in the left hemisphere of the brain, just as humans do, they write this week in Science . But the dogs didn't do this for the meaningless words. “There's no acoustic reason for this difference,” Andics says. “It shows that these words have meaning to dog.”
The dogs also processed intonation in the right hemisphere of their brains, also like humans. And when they heard words of praise delivered in a praising tone, yet another part of their brain lit up: the reward area. Meaning and tone enhanced each other. “They integrate the two types of information to interpret what they heard, just as we do,” Andics says.
The new results add to scientists' knowledge of how canine brains process human speech. Dogs have brain areas dedicated to interpreting voices, distinguishing sounds (in the left hemisphere), and analyzing the sounds that convey emotions (in the right hemisphere).
The finding “doesn't mean that dogs understand everything we say,” says Julie Hecht, who studies canine behavior and cognition at City University of New York in New York City and who was not involved in the study. “But our words and intonations are not meaningless to dogs.” Fitch hopes that similar studies will be done on other domestic animals and on human-raised wolves to see how much of this ability is hardwired in dogs and how much is due to growing up among talking humans.
The effect of heat treatments, at various water activities (aW), on digestibility and on the availabilities of amino acids of whey protein samples in the presence of lactose was estimated by an in vitro digestion method with continuous dialysis. Four aW (0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.97), three temperatures (75, 100 and 121 degrees C) and three heating periods (50, 500 and 5000 s) were selected. The initial lysine:lactose molar ratio was 1:1. Amino acid profiles showed that excessive heating of whey (121 degrees C, 5000 s) destroyed a significant proportion of cystine at all aW, lysine at aW 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7, and arginine at aW 0.5 and 0.7. At aW 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7, protein digestibility decreased (P less than 0.05) as the temperature increased from 75 to 121 degrees C for a heating period of 5000 s, and as the heating time was prolonged, from 500 to 5000 s at 121 degrees C. Excessive heating also decreased (P less than 0.05) the availabilities of all amino acids at aW 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7. The availabilities of lysine, proline, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, threonine, alanine, glycine and serine were particularly affected. Severe heating at aW 0.97 did not seem to favour the Maillard reaction, but the availabilities of cystine, tyrosine and arginine were decreased, probably as a result of structural modifications of the protein upon heating. Heating whey protein concentrates in the presence of lactose not only affected lysine, but also impaired enzymic liberation of other amino acids, according to the severity of heat treatments and aW.
In January of 1985, 23-year-old Michael J. Fox was summoned for a meeting in producer Gary David Goldberg's office. Four years earlier, Goldberg had given Fox his break as young republican Alex P. Keaton in the series Family Ties, and even though Fox had become its breakout star he was nervous Goldberg was going to take the show in another direction.
“I went to his office and he talked to me a little bit about the show and how I was doing on the show,” Fox recalls. “I'd only been doing it for three or four years so I didn't know if he was going to fire me.”
Unbeknownst to the Edmonton born, Burnaby raised actor, Goldberg had been doing quite the opposite. Months earlier, fearing losing his star while show mother Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave, Goldberg had refused to let writer-director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg speak with Fox for the lead role of Marty McFly in their upcoming film, Back To The Future. But with filming under way with Eric Stoltz in the role, Zemeckis once again turned to Goldberg, explaining the film needed Fox as the plucky McFly.
Thirty years later, during an interview on the set of his new television show, Fox says what transpired next would be his favourite memory of the entire shoot.
Here he recalls the experience in his own words:
It was just how quickly it happened. It was just a whirlwind. I didn't know why [Goldberg] was calling me into his office, then he puts this envelope down in front of me and tells me it's the script for this movie, Back To The Future, and would I read it and tell him if I wanted to do it because he'd tell his friend Steven Spielberg. So I picked up the script and I went like this (motions picking up the script, putting it down) and said, ‘It's the best script I've ever read.'
A couple days later I was in a beach house in Malibu with wardrobe designers picking out wardrobe and [the next day] I was shooting the scene where the car disappears into flames and Doc is dancing (see below).
That was my first memory of my first scene I shot, just kind of standing there with this camcorder watching Chris Lloyd dance in the flames going ‘Woo Hoo.' That was the beginning of it and I'd say that was my best memory of it.
I loved shooting the rock and roll scenes, but really that first moment of realizing I was involved [is my favourite].
Three days earlier I had no idea of the movie or the chance that I'd be doing it, then I was suddenly in parking lot in Pomona.

A prominent former restaurateur was sentenced to nine years in prison by a Los Angeles court for poisoning a pregnant girlfriend.
Last fall Joshua Woodward was convicted of slipping Misoprostol, a pregnancy termination drug, to his romantic partner Gail Greaves, when she was 13 weeks pregnant, according to ABC 13.
In 2009 Woodward, prosecutors said, gave Greaves the drug three times: once orally and twice vaginally during sexual foreplay, the New York Daily News reported.
Authorities found multiple searches on Woodward's computer where he looked for ways to terminate pregnancies. The Daily News disclosed that Woodward “typed the phrases, ‘ways men have forced abortions,' and ‘evil ways to terminate a pregnancy,' into his web search engine.”
Woodward's criminal behavior was uncovered when Greaves noticed him taking something from his backpack during a sexual encounter. She grew alarmed when she experienced a miscarriage just hours later. Greaves then called police when she noticed white powder in her panties.
The police told Greaves to invite Woodward over again, and instructed her not to tell him about the miscarriage. They then confronted Woodward and discovered Misoprostol on his person.
“You're disgusting”, Greaves said to Woodward during sentencing, ABC 13 reported. “I hope that you can find the truth within your heart and in your soul, and just be honest. . .You're drugging the drink you gave me, drugging my food. Do you really not understand what you've done to me?”
If you missed last week's post at Bicycle Design about velomobiles, be sure to check it out. In addition to the links that I mentioned in the body of the post, a few of you shared additional interesting velomobile designs in the comments section. I ended that post saying “whether you call them velomobiles, HPVs, or even human powered cars, it is great to see pedal powered machines stealing the show in Detroit.” The answer to that question of what exactly you should call these vehicles isn't always clear, and it becomes even less so when you consider the numerous electric assist models on the market. Enclosed pedelec vehicles ranging from the practical Organic Transit ELF to the speed-focused Raht Racer (Recumbent Automotive Human Transport) blur the lines between a traditional velomobile (basically a recumbent bike or trike with an aerodynamic shell) and a lightweight electric car. Perhaps we should just view these vehicles as a completely separate sustainable personal transportation category, and dispense with the comparisons to bikes and cars altogether. Maybe…but for now let's do compare.
Low Tech Magazine addressed some of those category questions in 2010 with an excellent article titled, The velomobile: high-tech bike or low-tech car? (thanks to Adolfo for sharing that link on the Bicycle Design Facebook page).Toward the beginning of the article, they compare human powered velomobiles to standard upright bicycles, with a chart to illustrate the incredible efficiency of the former.
“The power output required to achieve a speed of 30 kilometres per hour (18.6 mph) in a state-of-the-art velomobile (the Quest) is only 79 watts, compared to 271 watts on a normal bicycle.”
“Pedaling at a speed of 30 km/h thus requires 3.5 times less energy with a velomobile than with a normal bicycle.”
In that article, they also compare velomobiles to electric vehicles, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of velomobiles as an alternative to the automobile. It is also worth checking out just to see a variety of interesting designs that you may not have seen before.
A later (2012) post at Low Tech Magazine brings electric assist velomobiles into the discussion , a vehicle category that they refer to as “fast and comfortable as automobiles, but 80 times more efficient.” They illustrate that point with a hypothetical scenario:
“Imagine that all 300 million Americans replace their car with an electric velomobile and all drive to work on the same day. To charge the 288 Wh battery of each of these 300 million eWAW's, we need 86,4 GWh of electricity. This is only 25 % of the electricity produced by existing American wind turbines (on average per day during the period July 2011 to June 2012, source). In other words, we could make a switch to private vehicles operating on 100 % renewable energy, using existent energy plants.”
For comparison, “imagine that all 300 million Americans replaced their cars with an electric version like the Nissan Leaf, and all drive to work on the same day. To charge the 24 kW battery of each of those 300 million vehicles, we need 7,200 Gwh of electricity. This is 20 times more than what American wind turbines produce today, and 80 times more than what electric velomobiles need.”
The article at Low Tech Magazine goes into much more depth about the practical advantages of electric velomobiles… and in part two they discuss government regulations and societal views that are preventing widespread adoption of human/electric powered vehicles. They point out that “the bicycle ‘evolved' during the early 20th century into the faster motorcycle and next into the faster and more comfortable automobile, implying a logically ordered series of improvements which reflects an inevitable progress and an increasing rationality.” Because the older forms of transport in that linear evolution model are considered by many to be outdated and inferior, they propose a “non-evolinear” framework for the development of new and efficient personal transport designs (if that doesn't make sense…read the article).
I could continue on with all of the velomobile links that I had planned to share in part two, but instead I want to cut it short and encourage you again to read the two Low Tech Magazine articles. For more on the subject, I also encourage you to read Bicycles Don't Evolve: Velomobiles and the Modelling of Transport Technologies, a chapter from Cycling and Society by Peter Cox and Frederik Van De Walle, and Van De Walle's 2004 Master of Science Thesis titled “The velomobile as a vehicle for more sustainable transportation (a pdf file) ” (both of which are referenced in the articles mentioned above).
Since I deviated from the original plan for part two, you can expect to see a third in the series about velomobiles soon. And who knows… at the rate that you all are sharing interesting links with me, there might even be a fourth post about velomobiles (or whatever you choose to call them) soon. Keep sharing those links…I love to hear from those of you who know a lot more about this subject that I do.
Update: The Raht Racer, the “highway speed” electric assist velomobile mentioned and shown at the top of this post, is now on Kickstarter. Take a look at the page to learn more about it, and be sure to watch the video. As a pedelec with the power to amplify a rider's effort to speeds of up to 70 mph, this is definitely an interesting human/electric vehicle that defies categorization. Regardless of what you call it… the Raht Racer looks like fun and I would love to take a test spin in one.
Suspect arrested after shooting, robbery, chase Copyright by WOODTV - All rights reserved Police handcuff Theo Little and put him into a police vehicle. (April 28, 2016) [ + - ] Video
24 Hour News 8 web staff -
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) -- The man suspected of shooting his girlfriend at a Grand Rapids apartment was arrested Thursday evening after also allegedly stealing a car and then leading police on a chase.
Police took the suspect, earlier identified as Theo Little, into custody near John Ball Park on Grand Rapids' west side around 6 p.m. Thursday.
The shooting happened around 9:35 a.m. Thursday at the Cambridge Apartments on Mason Street NE. Police said the woman was shot in the neck by her boyfriend when she was trying to evict him from their apartment.

The 27-year-old woman, identified by family as Daphanie Joiner, was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery. Family said Thursday night she was doing well. Police said she was in stable condition.
Little, 35, took off after the shooting. Police warned he was armed and dangerous.
Around 5:10 p.m., Kentwood police officers responded to Specialized Staffing Solutions on 28th Street, across from Woodland Mall, after getting a report of an armed robbery.
They said a man armed with a handgun entered the business, threatened two female employees and forced them into a bathroom. Police say the suspect took one of the women's purses, which contained her keys, and stole her car -- a red Mazda.
Police said the victims knew the suspect, as he had previously worked through the staffing agency.
There were no reports of injuries at the staffing business.
Kentwood police said they passed along information about the stolen car to other agencies and Grand Rapids police spotted it around 5:45 p.m.
Video posted to Facebook by Colton Beveridge shows the car stopped on Fulton Street at Monroe Avenue, near the B.O.B. Several police cruisers are stopped behind it, officers standing outside their cars with guns drawn.
Then, as one police cruiser approaches the front of the car in an apparent attempt to box it in, the suspect pulled forward, hitting the cruiser in the front passenger's side. The car then speeds off, headed west on Fulton, at least a dozen police vehicles in hot pursuit.
==Watch the video from Beveridge below. App users can click here to watch.==
Witnesses said the car was going fast when the driver overcompensated for a curve and then crashed into a tree on Fulton Street just west of the John Ball Zoo entrance.
Grand Rapids Police Department Sgt. Terry Dixon said the suspect came out of the car with his gun in his hand.
"He was told to drop the gun and he did drop the gun and at that point he began to follow the officers' commands and he was taken into custody," Dixon said.

Police believe the gun the suspect was carrying is the same one used in the shooting.
Police told 24 Hour News 8 Little was on probation and had an arrest warrant related to a larceny in Grand Rapids. He was in the Kent County jail Thursday night.
Wednesday, Children's Protective Services removed children from the apartment where the shooting happened for an unknown reason, according to police.

It may be just a tiny gold bead — 4 millimetres (1/8 inch) in diameter — but it is an enormous discovery for Bulgarian archaeologists who say they have found Europe's — and probably the world's — the oldest gold artifact.
The bead, found at a pre-historic settlement in southern Bulgaria, dates back to 4,500-4,600 B.C., the archaeologists say, making it some 200 years older than jewellery from a Copper Age necropolis in the Bulgarian Black Sea city of Varna, the oldest processed gold previously unearthed, in 1972.
"I have no doubt that it is older than the Varna gold," Yavor Boyadzhiev, associated professor at the Bulgarian Academy of Science, said.
"It's a really important discovery. It is a tiny piece of gold but big enough to find its place in history."
1st urban settlement in Europe
Boyadzhiev, believes the bead was made at the site, just outside the modern town of Pazardzhik, which he says was the first "urban" settlement in Europe, peopled by "a highly-cultured society" which moved there from Anatolia, in today's Turkey, around 6,000 B.C.
"I would say it is a prototype of a modern town, though we can say what we have here is an ancient town, judged by Mesopotamian standards," Boyadzhiev said.
"But we are talking about a place which preceded Sumer by more than 1,000 years," he added, referring to what is usually considered the first urban civilization, based in southern Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq.
The gold bead, weighing 15 centigrams (0.005 ounce), was dug up two weeks ago in the remains of a small house that would have stood at a time when metals such as copper and gold were being used for a first time.
The settlement unearthed so far is between 10 and 12 hectares (25-30 acres) and would have had a 2.8-metre-high (9-foot) fortress wall. Anything over 0.7-0.8 hectares is regarded as a town by researchers working in Mesopotamia, Boyadzhiev said.
More than 150 ceramic figures of birds have been found at the site, indicating the animal was probably worshipped by the town's people. The settlement was destroyed by hostile tribes who invaded from the north-east around 4,100 B.C.
The bead will be exhibited in the historical museum in Pazardzhik once it has been thoroughly analyzed and its age
confirmed, a museum worker said.
Globalisation and economic nationalism
Italo Colantone, Piero Stanig
The revival of nationalism in western Europe, which began in the 1990s, has been associated with increasing support for radical right parties. This column uses trade and election data to show that the radical right gets its biggest electoral boost in regions most exposed to Chinese exports. Within these regions communities vote homogenously, whether individuals work in affected industries or not.
There has been a revival of nationalism in western democracies. The outcome of the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump as president of the US are two major manifestations of this tendency. In Europe this trend began in the 1990s, and it has been associated with increasing support for radical right parties (Mudde 2007).
In recent paper, we show that globalisation is a key determinant of this phenomenon (Colantone and Stanig 2017). We focus on the competitive shock created by the surge in imports from China between 1988 and 2007. This shock has had a heterogeneous impact across European regions that depends on the historical composition of employment in the region. Using data on legislative elections in 15 western European countries, we find that stronger regional exposure to the import shock determines an increase in support for nationalist parties, a general shift to the right in the electorate, and an increase in support for radical right parties. The policy proposals of these parties tend to bundle support for domestic free market policies with a strong protectionist stance, a combination that has come to be referred to as ‘economic nationalism'. As parties offering this policy mix become increasingly successful, we might see the end – and possibly even a reversal – of globalisation.
The Chinese import shock
We built a region-specific indicator for the exposure to Chinese imports following the methodology introduced by Autor et al. (2013). This combined information on yearly national imports from China, by industry, with data on the historical composition of employment in each region. The exposure of regions to the growth in Chinese imports depends on their ex ante industry specialisation. Intuitively, larger import shocks would happen in regions which have a larger share of their workers in the manufacturing sector. Given the same share of manufacturing workers, the variation in exposure to Chinese imports between regions would depend on differences in the specialisation of each region's manufacturing industry.
The shock would be stronger in regions where relatively more workers were initially employed in those industries in which growth in imports from China was strongest (for example, textiles or electronic goods), and in years when the surge in Chinese imports in those industries was largest.
We performed the analysis at the NUTS-2 level of regional disaggregation. In total, our sample included 198 regions across 15 countries.1 Depending on the country, we sourced employment data either from Eurostat or from national sources. Trade data come from Eurostat Comext or from CEPII-BACI. The industry level of disaggregation is the NACE Rev. 1.1 subsection level. Figure 1 displays the variation in the import shock across regions, based on average regional figures; darker shades indicate stronger exposure.
Figure 1 Map of the Chinese import shock across regions
District-level evidence
We assembled election data at the district level for 76 general elections between 1988 and 2007. Data comes from the Constituency-Level Election Archive (CLEA, Kollman et al. 2016), the Global Election Database (GED, Brancati 2016), and national sources. For each district, in each election, we had information on vote shares at the party level.
We linked election results with ideology scores for each party so that we could assess the ideological leaning of a district in an election. To do this we used data from the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP), which attributes policy positions by using content analysis of party election manifestos. Following the established methodology used by Laver and Budge (1992) and Lowe et al. (2011), we computed two scores for each party in each election: a ‘nationalism' score, and a ‘right-wing positioning' score. We then combined these ideology scores with party vote shares to compute several district-level summaries for each election.
We computed, for both nationalism and right positioning:
The district-level weighted average
The median voter score and
The combined vote share of parties above the national median position on that dimension.
Finally, we also computed one district-level summary to address directly the connection between globalisation and radical right success. This was the vote share of radical right parties. We identified these parties using earlier research.2 Figure 2 shows the growth in the vote share for these parties over the sample; each point in the figure is a 3-year moving average.
Figure 2 Vote share for radical right parties
To investigate the impact of globalisation on voting, we regressed the district-level summaries on the region-specific Chinese import shock, computed for the two years prior to each election. To account for the potential endogeneity of the import shock, we instrumented Chinese imports to Europe using Chinese imports to the US, as in Autor et al. (2013), Colantone et al. (2015), and Bloom et al. (2016), among others. This strategy aims to capture the variation in Chinese imports that is due to changes in supply conditions in China, rather than the changes that are due to endogenous domestic factors in Europe. We always included election fixed effects to control for factors that affect all districts of a country at a given point in time – for instance, national economic performance. Independently on the specific summary indicator we employed, we found that a stronger import shock led to:
An increase in support for nationalist parties
A shift to the right in the electorate and
An increase in support for radical right parties.
Our research predicts that a region at the 75th percentile of the import shock would display support for radical right parties by 0.7 percentage points more than a region at the 25th percentile, ceteris paribus. Considering that the average vote share for radical right parties is 5%, with a standard deviation of 7%, this result is not negligible.
Our results contribute to an emerging body of research on the electoral consequences of globalisation. For the US, others have already investigated the effects of trade exposure on polarisation, turnout, and the anti-incumbent vote (Autor et al. 2016, Che et al. 2016, Margalit, 2011, Jensen et al. 2015). In France, Malgouyres (2014) investigated the effect on radical right support, and Dippel et al. (2016) did the same for Germany. In our previous work, we have also adopted a similar identification strategy to show a positive effect of the Chinese import shock on support for the ‘Leave' option in the Brexit referendum (Colantone and Stanig, 2016a and 2016b).
Individual-level evidence
We found additional evidence by using individual-level data from the European Social Survey. Accounting for basic demographic characteristics and election fixed effects, a stronger import shock in the region of residence pushed voters towards more nationalist and conservative policy positions, and increased the probability of support for radical right parties, in line with our district-level evidence. We also investigated, through interaction terms, how the effects of import competition varied across different categories of voters, based on their employment status and occupation. These effects were largely stable across the groups, even when considering service workers and public sector workers, whose jobs were not directly affected by manufacturing imports from China. Our evidence suggests that the impact of import competition was not confined to groups, such as the unemployed or manufacturing workers, which might have been more directly affected by Chinese imports. On the contrary, as globalisation threatens the success and survival of entire industrial districts, the affected communities seem to have voted in a homogeneous way, regardless of each voter's personal situation.
A more inclusive globalisation
Globalisation has caused a surge in support for nationalist and radical right political platforms. This might endanger the survival of the open world of the past 30 years. President Trump's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership seems to be a move in that direction. Yet, a return to protectionism is not likely to solve the problems of those who have lost ground due to globalisation without appropriate compensation of its ‘losers', and is bound to harm growth especially in emerging economies. The world rather needs a more inclusive model of globalisation.

"Knocked Up" stars Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann will reprise their married characters from that film in Judd Apatow's next comedy for Universal Pictures, the studio has confirmed to TheWrap.
Apatow will write and direct the untitled project, which is currently scheduled to start production later this year in time for a June 1, 2012 release.
While the logline remains a mystery, it will be great to see Rudd and Mann playing off each other on the big screen again, as the duo shared fantastic chemistry as the quarrelsome couple in "Knocked Up." Mann played Katherine Heigl's sister in the $200 million-grossing comedy, and it's still unclear whether Heigl or co-star Seth Rogen will reprise their roles, though Heigl has called out Apatow in the past for his portrayal of women.
Mann is married to Apatow and has co-starred in all three of her husband's movies, while Rudd has popped up in several Apatow-produced comedies, although he did not appear in the filmmaker's last directorial effort, 2009's "Funny People."
Rudd recently starred in James L. Brooks' romantic comedy "How Do You Know," and will soon be seen opposite Jennifer Aniston in the Universal comedy "Wanderlust."
Both Rudd and Mann have films at this month's Sundance Film Festival, as Rudd stars in "My Idiot Brother," while Mann appears in Elgin James' "Little Birds."
In addition to voicing a role in the animated film "Rio," Mann is also set to co-star alongside Ryan Reynolds and Jason Bateman in Universal's "The Change-Up."
Mann is represented by CAA, while Rudd and Apatow are repped by UTA.
The duo's casting in Apatow's next movie was first reported by Variety.
OGDEN — A snowboarder said he feared for his safety on the slopes during an altercation with an angry father. It happened after he accidentally collided with the man's son.
Like almost everything these days, the entire thing was caught on video.
"I was going down the hill about average speed," said Daniel Poulsen.
A camera mounted to his helmet showed him and friends heading down a run at Snowbasin when a small child on skis came into the frame from the left.
"I was cut off by a girl and I was run in between an adult and her," he said. "I tried to just dodge in between them. A small boy came out from behind the adult to where I couldn't avoid hitting him."
Poulsen said he immediately checked to make sure the boy was OK.
"As I was looking back up the hill, after I stopped sliding, the father of the boy came down and started yelling at me," Poulsen said. "He got in my face and started cussing at me. And then he punched me."
The impact is audible on the video. Poulsen said the punch to his right temple left him with a headache and a bruise.
"I was angry, a little bit fearful," he said. "I felt a little bit guilty for hitting his kid. I definitely didn't do it on purpose."
I was angry, a little bit fearful ... I definitely didn't do it on purpose. –Daniel Poulsen
Poulsen and his friends finished the run and got in touch with Ski Patrol. He said they brought him and the father back together.
"(They) had him give me an apology, which I didn't feel was sincere. But it was still an apology," Poulsen said.
Poulsen said he still wants to find out who the man is and make sure he doesn't do this to anyone else.
"It surprised me that the man didn't talk, didn't ask his son if he was OK before he came to get in my face. I wish he would have done that," Poulsen said.
He said he's not sure if he wants to press charges if he's able to identify the man who hit him.
Snowbasin said in a statement the issue was resolved amicably and the resort is relieved no one was seriously injured.

BOISE, March 21, 2014 – On Thursday, Idaho Governor Butch Otter (R) signed a bill, which would effectively nullify future federal gun laws, by prohibiting state enforcement of any future federal act relating to personal firearms, a firearm accessories or ammunition.
S1332 passed the house by a vote of 68-0 and the senate by a vote of 34-0. Alaska and Kansas have also passed similar laws.
Erich Pratt, Director of Communications for Gun Owners of America, cheered the governor's action. “By signing this nullification bill into law, Idaho has joined an elite class of states that are telling the feds to ‘get lost' — especially when it comes to unconstitutional gun control infringements”
Introduced by the State Affairs Committee, the Idaho Federal Firearm, Magazine and Register Ban Enforcement Act, will:
“protect Idaho law enforcement officers from being directed, through federal executive orders, agency orders, statutes, laws, rules, or regulations enacted or promulgated on or after the effective date of this act, to violate their oath of office and Idaho citizens' rights under Section 11, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho.”
The legislation continued:
any official, agent or employee of the state of Idaho or a political subdivision thereof who knowingly and willfully orders an official, agent or employee of the state of Idaho or a political subdivision of the state to enforce any executive order, agency order, law, rule or regulation of the United States government as provided in subsection (2) of this section upon a personal firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition shall, on a first violation, be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) which shall be paid into the general fund of the state…
S1332 also includes an emergency provision meaning it takes effect immediately upon signature.
Tenth Amendment Center national communications director Mike Maharrey considered the legislation a good start. “This is an important first step for Idaho,” he said. “Getting this law passed will ensure that any new plans or executive orders that might be coming our way will not be enforced in Idaho. Then, once this method is established and shown to be effective, legislators can circle back and start doing the same for federal gun control already on the books. SB1332 is an important building block for protecting the 2nd Amendment in Idaho.”
Passage into law represents a giant step forward in protecting the right to keep and bear arms in Idaho. As the law now stands, state and local law enforcement will not cooperate with all future federal firearm laws.
The bill rests on a well-established legal principle known as the anti-commandeering doctrine. Simply put, the federal government cannot force states to help implement or enforce and federal act or program The anti-commandeering doctrine rests primarily on four Supreme Court cases dating back to 1842. Printz v. United States serves as the cornerstone.
Tenth Amendment Center executive director Michael Boldin said that the new Idaho law has opened Pandora's box even wider.
“People are beginning to realize that this practice is completely constitutional and legal. In the near future, you will see a wave of states passing even broader legislation to fight the federal government on everything ranging from more traditionally liberal issues like hemp and marijuana, to more conservative issues like Obamacare.” Boldin continued, “Nullification isn't a left vs. right issue. It destroys the fallacy of the left right paradigm and is the remedy for all unconstitutional laws.”

Hwy. 101 crash near Cloverdale splits car down middle, injures 2
Tom Bond was driving north on Highway 101 Saturday morning on his way to a farm he owns in Chico. He had just rounded a bend in the road about 8 a.m. when he saw smoke, and debris flying through the air.
The sight that met him was, he said, “the craziest thing I've ever seen, and I've seen many accidents.”
At first glance, it seemed the two-vehicle crash near Geysers Road must have been deadly. A Chevrolet Impala was split down the middle, half of it spun onto a hill alongside the highway. A Toyota Sequoia's hood was squashed into its front seat.
There were injuries, but no fatalities.
Said Bond, 70, a former U.S. Air Force ambulance driver, “It was just unbelievable.”
According to the CHP, Apol Lansang, 25, of Sonoma, was driving her Impala south on Highway 101, near Geysers Road when she was struck by the northbound Sequoia being driven by Kevin Fenty, 27, of Huntington Beach, that drifted across the highway into Lansang's lane.
The impact sliced Lansang's car down the middle, sending the car's entire passenger side onto the embankment. Fenty was ejected by the impact. Both drivers were taken to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital — Lansang with minor injuries and Fenty with moderate injuries, according to the CHP.
“The scene was, it was pretty intense,” said Sgt. Jason Bahlman, who has been with the CHP for 16 years. “It was definitely one of the most severely damaged cars I've ever seen.”
The 8 a.m. crash shut down traffic on Highway 101 intermittently throughout Saturday morning. Its cause is still under investigation, but drugs are believed to be a factor.
There were about four or five cars between him and the accident, Bond said, the passengers of which all got out to tend to the injured.
“I was shaken,” he said. “I mean, my family is still shaken. I drive that stretch every single day. It is so dangerous.”

Researchers at The University of Queensland yesterday moved one step closer to sending small satellites into space via a reusable launch system.
The launch of a small plane on 23 December marked the first successful use of the Austral Launch Vehicle (ALV), which is designed to return to its base after carrying a satellite into space.
UQ Chair of Hypersonic Propulsion Professor Michael Smart said current single-use launch systems for small satellites made it incredibly expensive to send satellites into orbit.
“Currently, once launch systems have travelled their designated trajectory, they drop away and fall into the ocean,” Professor Smart said.
This is where the ALV differs.
“Working in partnership with Brisbane-based start-up companies Heliaq Advanced Engineering, and Australian Droid and Robot, we've designed a rocket system that can be re-used,” Professor Smart said.
“It is a rocket booster in the usual sense, but instead of falling into the ocean once it has done its job, it deploys wings and a propeller motor, so it can safely return to base.
“UQ has a great interest in this new technology since we have worked for many years to develop reusable scramjet vehicles that fly like planes.
“The combination of the ALV and a UQ scramjet would mean almost 85 per cent of a satellite launch system would be reusable.

“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Australia to become a part of the space sector.”
The successful launch of the ALV has the research team looking to the international market, with a projected demand for 400 satellites in 2016.
“I think there is real potential for Australia to become the ‘go-to' country for small satellite launches, and I see this as playing a vital role in Australia's innovation revolution,” Professor Smart said.

“I am puzzled by God's wisdom
That, among all nations, has
denied Kurds a state of their own!”
This is how Kurdish poet Ahmadi Khani expressed his people's feelings in “Love and Life,” the epic he composed in 1690.
Three centuries later, the Kurds still don't have a state but represent a spider's-web set of ethnic and sectarian fractures that threaten the integrity of at least five nations.
At the time Khani wrote, a majority of mankind lived in a dozen empires or a jigsaw of isolated tribal entities with the concept of nation-state unknown outside Europe.
Now, in a world dotted with 198 nation-states, the Kurds represent the largest “nation” without a “state.”
Stuck in the center of every Middle East conflict, the Kurds are a rarity: a sympathetic ally. Supporting them is not without risk, as it could cause even more upheaval in the region, but if the US acts strongly and prudently, the Kurds could help keep Iran, ISIS and others in check.
In Turkey
While there is no Kurdish state, there certainly is a Kurdish “space” designated by the Persian-Kurdish word “Kurdivary,” which means “Kurdishness.”
That space spans a large chunk of the Middle East plus a large Kurdish diaspora.
The many communities included in “Kurdivary” number between 30 and 40 million people, according to who is counting. Almost half live in Turkey, representing a quarter of the population. The second-largest community, more than 5 million, is in Iraq, and a further 4 million in Iran. Syria is home to 2.2 million Kurds. Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, are home to around 1 million Kurds.
In Turkey, ethnic Kurdish voters helped sweep the conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power more than a decade ago and saw it through three successful general elections. In exchange the AKP, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, now president of Turkey, took a series of measures to lift decades old anti-Kurdish measures, including a ban on even mentioning the word “Kurd” in the media.
In 1991, an elected member of the Turkish parliament, Leyla Zana, nicknamed “Kurdish la Pasionaria,” took the oath of office in Kurdish, provoking a national scandal. Ten years later, no one noticed what language newly elected parliamentarians used.
Erdoğan also negotiated a cease-fire with the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) a leftist guerrilla movement initially seeking to create a Soviet-style republic. Now, however, with Erdoğan developing neo-Ottoman fantasies, a growing number of Turkey's Kurds have abandoned AKP in favor of a new outfit, the People's Democratic Party (HDP), that has emerged as the country's major opposition force.
Relations between AKP and the Kurds have also suffered from Erdoğan's decision to revive the military campaign against the PKK in the hope of appealing to the Turkish nationalist groups. Kurds were especially shaken when Erdoğan turned a blind eye to the ISIS campaign to seize Kurdish territory and conduct massive ethnic cleansing in favor of Arab Sunni Muslims.
Last weekend, 99 people were killed at a rally that was calling for an end to fighting between the Turkish government and PKK. It's unclear who was behind the bombing, though officials were pointing fingers at ISIS.
In next month's general election, Kurdish voters may spell the end of Erdoğan's domination of Turkish politics. More importantly, perhaps, Turkey's Kurds seem to have undergone a major ideological shift away from both Stalinism and romantic 19th century-style nationalism in favor of pluralist and democratic positions.
The idea of a truly democratic Turkey in which Kurds enjoy a large measure of autonomy within semi-federal structures is gaining ground with a young generation of politicians symbolized by the HDP leader Selahattin Demirtas.
Such a scenario could provide Turkey with a new basis for long-term stability.
In Syria
In neighboring Syria the picture is different.
There, Kurds are divided into three camps.
One camp, consisting of half a dozen groups and parties, has sought an arrangement with the Bashar al-Assad government in Damascus in exchange for promised concessions such as the restoration of Syrian nationality to over 1.2 million ethnic Kurds who were declared “non-Syrians” in the 1970s.
Another camp consists of several associations and tribes working with Iraqi Kurds, who are led by Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan. The goal is to create an extended Kurdish autonomous region in both Iraq and Syria. That camp is backed by Barzani's Peshmerga fighters in his 50,000-strong national guard.
A third camp is represented by the PKK, which has had a presence in Syria for almost four decades. Its Syrian branch, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) has concluded that Syria will never again emerge as a unitary state and that time has come for Kurds to carve out a mini-state of their own in at least three Syrian provinces bordering Turkey and Iraq.
Turkey is not alone in opposing such a scheme.
Iran also is concerned because a mini-Kurdish state dominated by PKK would block the channel that Iran needs to send men and arms to the rest of Syria and beyond it to Lebanon. The PKK has retaliated by reactivating its Iranian branch, known as Kurdish Party of Life (PJAK), which has carried out a series of attacks in western Iran since 2013. That, in turn, has soured relations between Tehran and the PKK further, with the Iranians no longer allowing Kurdish fighters attacking targets in Turkey to use safe havens in Iranian territory.
Russia is equally hostile to the PKK scheme because Kurdish secession could speed up the end of Assad's regime in Damascus while threatening the Syrian coastal enclave that President Vladimir Putin hopes to transform into a permanent base in the Mediterranean.
In Iran
Making things more complicated are the rifts between the Kurdish movements.
Iraqi Kurdistan has flourished, after the US invasion of Iraq gave them more anonymity. It sees a Kurdish mini-state in Syria as a potential rival for the leadership of all Kurds. This is why Barzani has drawn closer to Turkey, a move that has sharpened differences with PKK.
Barzani's pro-Ankara tilt, in turn, has angered Tehran which, as the principal backer of President Assad, finds itself on the opposite side of Turkey in the Syrian war. Thus, Tehran is now pulling no punches to dislodge Barzani from his presidential position in Erbil. Iran is encouraging a complex power struggle among Iraqi Kurds that could split the area into two units.
Iraq President Fuad Masum, himself an ethnic Kurd, is working hard to keep the two halves of Iraqi “Kurdistan” together.
One important result of the internecine feuds of the Kurds is Barzani's decision to kick the plan for declaring independence from Iraq into long grass while he fights to prolong his presidential term which ended last August.
On Iran's homefront, meanwhile, the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI), one of the country's oldest political parties, has for the first time committed itself to working for regime change in Tehran. A smaller, left-wing outfit Kurdish Toilers' Party (Komala) long has pursued a strategy of armed resistance against the Islamic Republic.
Kurdistan rising?
Partly thanks to the spread of social media, the concept of “Kurdivary” is more alive than ever, appealing to the imagination of far larger numbers of ethnic Kurds across the globe.
For instance, when Tehran-born Omid Kordestani, an ethnic Kurd but now a US citizen, was named CEO of Twitter last week, a tsunami of pride hit “Kurdivary” across the globe.
What would a united Kurdish state look like?
It would consist of chunks of territory from Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Its largest city, in terms of number of inhabitants, would be Kermanshah, in Iran, while perhaps a majority of Kurds want Amid (Diar-Bekyr) in Turkey as the capital of their dream state. Thousands of ethnic Kurds from the US, Germany, France and even Australia might rush to the dream state to help build it as did Italians from all over the world when an Italian state was created in 1870.
However, the mirror image of that dream could be a nightmare of epic proportions with at least four Middle Eastern states determined to crush the secessionist aspirations of their Kurdish citizens while rival Kurdish parties would fight among themselves over who should be in the driver seat.
Those internal differences are significant. The Kurds speak four different, though closely associated, languages, written in four different alphabets- Arabic, modified Persian, Turkish-Latin, and Cyrillic. Though a majority of Kurds are Sunni Muslims, they are divided into numerous “schools,” not to mention Sufi fraternities. Even Shiite Kurds are divided into many sects, including the People of the Truth (Ahl-e-Haq) and Alevites.
Zoroastrian Kurds, better known as Yazidis, form an important community of their own, as do Kurdish Christians.
Inside the Kurdish majority areas and on their peripheries are a number of other ethnic groups, including the Faylieh in Iraq and the Elamites in Iran that, though closely linked with Kurdivary, could play “identity” games of their own.
The Kurdivary space is also dotted by other religious and ethnic groups notably Turcomans, Azeri and Armenians.
In other words, the mosaic that is the Middle East could be broken again and again.
On our side
Kurdish particularism is, in part, a natural reaction to the emergence of pan-Arab, pan-Turkish and pan-Iranist nationalisms as developed in the past 100 years under European influence, with the dream of imposing a single national-cultural narrative on a region steeped in diversity from the dawn of history.
In more recent decades, pan-Islamism, in both its Sunni and Shiite versions, has fostered a similar ambition with tragic results.
By rejecting uniformity in the name of narrow nationalism or Islam, the Kurds have rendered a great service to the people of the Middle East as a whole. The Kurdish quest for diversity was often backed by the Western democracies. including the United States. Under President Obama, however, the US was put in retreat mode in the Middle East, removing the sole power capable of influencing virtually all segments of Kurdivary.
Kurds of all denominations are now at the forefront of the struggle to contain and ultimately destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq.
Despite more than a year of airstrikes by the US and other NATO allies, the only major defeats suffered by ISIS were the work of Kurdish fighters. The battle of Kobani, a Kurdish city in Syria close to the Turkish border, will enter history as the first to end with ISIS being thrown out of a major part of its conquests.
If played right, the Kurdish card represents a counterbalance to dictators like Assad, Islamic radicals like ISIS and the dreams of an Iranian empire. They could help negotiate the entire Middle East out of the current dangerous bend in its history with the promise of a new regional order that reflects its immense ethnic, religious and linguistic diversity.
But that requires leadership on a scale that only the United States could provide — and hasn't.
No Treme spoilers contained within, very mild spoilers for The Wire.
Treme ran for thirty six episodes in four seasons from 2010 to 2013, concluding in late December. It is a series about the lives of people in New Orleans dealing with life there after the floods. Not everybody is a native, not everybody stays in the city all the time. The characters come from a variety of backgrounds and have a variety of jobs. There is a lot of music of pretty much every sort. That is about as succinct a description of the series as I can manage. Even having watched it and loved it, I still struggle to explain what it is actually about. The subjects, the themes and even the tone fluctuate unpredictably and pinning it down is never easy. Perhaps the best description of it is as a historical drama, despite being set less than a decade ago.
Treme was created by David Simon and shares many of the creative forces behind The Wire, with writers such as Eric Overmyer, George Palacanos and David Mills making the jump from Baltimore to New Orleans. Despite sharing some writing personnel and holding true to the David Simon maxim of “Fuck the Average Viewer” the differences between the shows are somewhat marked.
Firstly The Wire is actually quite easy to define; it's a cop show. It's not like other cop shows, but it is still a cop show. The presence of police officers and the narrative thread of investigating crimes mean that we sort of know what we are getting into with it. Even as the series moves into other areas of city life that thread remains. For Treme there is no equivalent definition, however vague. Treme is an extremely unfocused show with characters from very different worlds, experiencing life in very different tones. While the theme of following the money from the drug corners lead The Wire all over the city Treme flits between people and places as though Google Maps had a shuffle button.
This inability for the show to be easily defined hurts its appeal somewhat, because no matter how much we all claim to love originality – when we are actually confronted by something new, something that offers few recognisable features to cling to, it is a challenge. With The Wire we saw this in season two, the story of the longshoremen, unions and smugglers was unfamiliar and to some it appeared to jar with the first and later seasons. Even if a series is going to confound expectations it can still benefit viewers to have expectations at first. Treme is like that the whole way through, unfamiliar and always defying attempts to categorise and file it.
This in some ways might explain why Treme did not simply pick up the same audience as The Wire and run with it. No matter how unusual The Wire was people will always love a cop show. Treme has never had that immediacy, but this does not make it a lesser show. It does however make it much harder to follow. This is doubly true if, like me, you're not a big music fan. I could rave about the fact that the cast are all spectacularly good and I could babble for hours about the way that the show can say more in a single wordless moment than most series ever manage in their entire runs, but as for the music, knowing as little about it as I do, it leaves me cold. But I still love the show.
For everything that Treme has which makes it harder to engage with at first, it compensates by being stronger in some important ways. For example Treme enjoys a greater sense of narrative completeness than The Wire. The Wire has an ending set up at the end of season three but it carries on for another two seasons. The fourth is strong but the fifth is notably the weakest, creating the sense that, while leaping to great heights at its peak the series failed to stick the landing. Treme by contrast concludes at its own pace, season four is much shorter than the others and tidies up the loose ends without adding new main characters or getting into new business.
Secondly Treme is less showy than The Wire. The Wire has a comparable story structure to a Greek tragedy, the heroes do their thing and the gods, or the various institutions in the case of The Wire, beat them down and repeat the cycle with new pawns. But for the characters to be challenging the conventions, for them to be worthy of being slapped by into line by the gods in the first place, they must be heroes. From Avon the master criminal to Ziggy the ultimate screw up there are few characters without some extraordinary virtue or flaw. This means that the main characters are often more representative than they are relatable. Treme by contrast is a series populated by more low key characters, as befitting the lower stakes of the series. The characters of Treme are dealing in local matters and their own affairs, things that are significant to their lives and the lives of the people of the city, but to an outsider there are few recognisably powerful figures in the series. No kingpins, no assassins, no master detectives.
This difference in the power of the characters manifests itself quite brutally in the violence of Treme. While The Wire largely contents itself with the drugs trade and those involved in it, Treme portrays the lives of people just trying to get by. New Orleans is a city with many of the problems of Baltimore, but they are not the focus here. In Treme we see the world through the eyes of those above the underclass, to various extents, above the worst of it, but not shielded from it. The way that violence reaches into their lives has a shocking, random quality. There is none of the desensitisation that permeates the characters of West Baltimore, the people of Treme have a vulnerability about them, a sense about them that when bad things happen they bite much harder for that.
This vulnerability is compounded by the portrayal of the New Orleans Police Department. From David Simon's work as an author and journalist, particularly his book Homicide: A Year On The Killing Streets, it is clear that, for all of his many concerns about the state of the American city and society as a whole, he is somewhat in love with the idea of the homicide detective. We see that in The Wire but not Treme, where the New Orleans Police Department, even the homicide division, are part of the problem, aiding and abetting the corruption which is painted as almost being as much a part of the place as the music.
All this is not to say that Treme does not have problems. Any given viewer will generally find one character or clump of characters that don't interest them very much. This seems to vary depending on who you ask, which feels like a consequence of personal tastes rather than bad writing. Also the lack of a Marlo Stanfield or Bill Rawls to personify of all that is wrong with their respective worlds can leave things feeling unchallenging. There is no villain and we see characters fighting their battles internally, often over what seem like trifling matters compared to bodies in vacant houses or thirteen Jane Does in a shipping container. Persistence with the series does pay off, the development and growth of the characters feels almost tangible, even if it is not always transformative, but it tests the patience hard.
Treme is not as strident as The Wire, it is not so forceful. When David Simon spoke recently about “Two Americas” it was still The Wire not Treme that he referenced, though either could be applicable. In a way it feels like Treme has been allowed to pass unnoticed, particularly in the UK, overlooked amid the likes of Breaking Bad, Downton Abbey and the his and hers Sherlock Holmes modernisations. In a country that struggles to produce TV of its own that isn't about doctors, cops or historical toffs this is the sort of thing we could use more of. Treme will stand the test of time, it will endure to be watched and enjoyed years from now; but you could get crushed by fifty million stampeding Romanians tomorrow, so you probably ought to watch it soon.

Let's get the simple part out of the way: The YouTube channel ContraPoints is very good. Regardless of the viewer's interest or lack thereof in internet culture wars, YouTube Nazis, or any of the other wide-ranging subjects covered in its videos, they're funny, bizarre, erudite, and compelling.
In one video, Contra — as the host is known — a 29-year-old trans woman living in Baltimore, spends an uncomfortably long cutaway shot trying to smoosh a hot dog into an electrical outlet. In another, she runs through snowy woods wearing nothing but underwear and a furry cape, imitating a Nordic-inspired white supremacist. Her videos, which cover everything from the concept of “alpha males” to autobiographical explanations of how her own politics developed, are thick with sexuality and, especially when it comes to the early ones, with good-natured, alcohol-drenched self-loathing. They're also, at this point, profitable enough for them to be her primary source of income — she earns more than $5,300 per video on Patreon — a figure that was almost $2,000 lower when I first interviewed her in August.
But maybe most importantly, ContraPoints isn't just a quality source of thoughtful entertainment or a successful YouTube business. It's also a much-needed volley at the right-wing domination of YouTube, and the beginnings of a blueprint for countering the rise of right-wing extremism and indoctrination on the video-sharing site.
If you're an average adult user, YouTube is the place where you can see Colbert clips and movie trailers. But for the young people who make up YouTube's most devoted audience, the site is as important a source of political content as it is a source of entertainment. Over the last few years, a rich ecosystem of commentators has established itself on the video-sharing site, recording video monologues purporting to explain the world. That network leans right. Hard. As John Herrman explained in a recent article in The New York Times Magazine, “YouTube is host to just one dominant native political community: the YouTube right.”
Like talk radio, YouTube hosts voices from across the political spectrum. But also like talk radio, most of the biggest and most successful ones are conservative — and not William Weld conservatives, but Steve Bannon conservatives. YouTube hosts petabytes of deeply reactionary content, and that quantity is growing by the minute. “[N]o [political] bloc is anywhere near as organized or as assertive as the YouTube right and its dozens of obdurate vloggers,” pointed out Herrman. “Nor is there a coherent group on the platform articulating any sort of direct answer to this budding form of reaction — which both validates this material in the eyes of its creators and gives it room to breathe, grow and assert itself beyond its immediate vicinity.”
That a video platform so beloved by adolescents is also so thoroughly dominated by a racist, extremist, reactionary right wing is a troubling thought, and one that hasn't been directly confronted — partly, no doubt, because YouTube flies so far beneath the radar of most adults who follow politics. But how can we check the rise of the extreme right online — not just on YouTube, but on any of the many social platforms where it appears to flourish? Contra may not have all the answers, but she has one: Meet them on their turf and outdo them.
***
Contra, who recently changed her name from the one she was born with to Natalie Parrott (I'll just call her Contra in this piece), got an early start on YouTube, making videos about atheism back in 2008 and 2009, when the online atheist scene was the locus of some of the web's most passionate politics. She'd given it up during grad school — she was a Ph.D. student in philosophy at Northwestern University — but when she dropped out in 2015, driving an Uber and copyediting to make money while she wrote fiction, she found herself back on what felt like a very different YouTube. The site was now recommending her far-right vloggers making videos about how feminism is cancer or how Black Lives Matter is the most racist organization in American history. “I was like, That's interesting,” she said. “What is going on with this?”
“I was looking at YouTube and seeing things really heat up again in terms of the popularity of talking about serious political or philosophical issues and almost no one doing leftist content that engaged with the other side in any way,” she explained. “I was like, I bet I can do this, so I gave it a shot, and it's worked out better than I expected.” Much of Contra's interest in this sort of debate stemmed from her belief that the left was bad at it, and had a tendency to adopt self-defeating rhetorical tactics.
In her video “Why I Quit Academia,” Contra lays out what could be seen as a mini-manifesto explaining her entire YouTube channel.
“Right-wing ding-dongs like to paint academia as some sort of leftist madrassa where Marxist-feminism is the only permissible worldview,” she explains. “This is an exaggeration, but it's not that much of an exaggeration.” She tells a story about encountering Robert Nozick's famous libertarian tract Anarchy, State, and Utopia in a seminar and finding herself unable to coherently argue against it. “We'd all cut our teeth dissecting these little squabbles between Rawls and Habermas, and we had no experience arguing against anything as far right as the political views that most Americans actually hold,” she says. “You have to go on YouTube for the real entertainment — and frankly, the real debate.”
To engage in debate, of course, you need an audience operating in good faith, making honest objections, and asking honest questions. On the internet, where disingenuous and manipulative trolls flourish, this premise might not always be warranted. A good YouTube commentator — especially one on the left, operating in essentially hostile territory — therefore has to pick her battles very carefully. At the same time, if your goal is to convince, you can't give up on the idea of debate entirely. “In general, I do think having a debate is good,” said Contra. “But when you have very disingenuous opponents and when they are rhetorically skilled, to show up to that debate is potentially to lose a debate to a Nazi, which is very bad, so it's something I'm afraid of.”
Contra's fear of losing a debate to a Nazi, as it were — not because she's wrong, but because Nazis don't fight fairly — underpins a lot of her work. As a longtime YouTuber, she's all too familiar with the endless and dishonest trashings of other people's content that dominate the site. Contra writes and structures her videos in a very careful, deliberate way designed to fortify them against manipulative and bad-faith responses: “I'm not uploading stuff that I haven't carefully controlled how each phrase is woven, which makes them hard to misinterpret,” she says. Background music makes it harder to chop up her videos in misleading or undermining ways, too, she explained, as does her constant humorous self-deprecation. All these tactics help her deploy funny, forceful, irony-laden arguments against lines of thinking that many left-of-center vloggers and commentators would consider not even worth debating, perhaps the best example being her video “Why Wh!te N@tionali$m Is Wrong.”
In that video and others, Contra explains what she means clearly and in plain language that can't be easily caricatured. It's at the core of what she does — even on very difficult, personal issues. The best example is probably her videos about gender identity, particularly “I Am Genderqueer (and What the #@%! That Means)” (as the title suggests, that video marked her coming out as genderqueer — she has since come out as a trans woman).
“Let's start at the beginning: What does ‘genderqueer' even mean?” she says early on. Then, she lays on some fake umbrage: “Well, hold on — why should I even have to explain this? Can people not use Google? I mean, surely in this day and age people have access to a wealth of reliable information” — at which point the camera cuts to a shot of Google-search suggestions to complete the term genderqueer is, among them, genderqueer is fake and genderqueer is ridiculous. Contra then shows some similarly derogatory YouTube clips.
What's striking about this, again, is Contra's ability to both explain why many online activists are leery about explaining certain important concepts, but also to, well, go on to explain them. In that video, she goes on to pull off a clear, relatable explanation of what being genderqueer meant to her — past tense because she is now in the process of transitioning to female and identifies as such. She hates her facial and body hair, she explains, and puts a lot of effort into removing it. She's “indifferent” when it comes to having breasts and a penis, and therefore doesn't see herself as a good candidate for surgery. “I actually don't want to surrender some of my masculine attributes,” she explains. “For instance, I kind of like my voice, and other people like it, too. People respect a masculine voice, and I'm not going to go passing on male privilege just to be true to myself” (here, the word JOKE flashes in huge letters onscreen).
Obviously, a single 13-minute video isn't going to convince skeptics to treat genderqueer people with respect. But given how common it is for the left-of-center internet to treat certain ideas, gender identity included among them, as sacred categories that shouldn't require any sort of real explanation, it's noteworthy just how much explaining Contra does in the video, and how effective that explaining is. “I think a lot of times the way we talk about gender identity or gender dysphoria is either in abstract medical and psychiatric terms or it's in social justice, activist terms, and both of those ways have a way of making it seem like a very abstract notion that people [find hard to understand],” she said in our interview. “I feel like you have to play this jargon game just because they say that it's important, and you don't really understand why. Well, if you can connect the jargon to something more concrete, to something more individual, an individual person's experience of it, then it suddenly acquires a reality that it didn't have when it was just a bunch of activist jargon.” In other words: Sure, the bad-faith just askin' questions crowd is out there, but so are people who genuinely want to understand what's going on. Someone has to explain this stuff to them in as clear a manner as possible.
Contra's transition is going to put a lot of her beliefs about the power of funny, meme-y, carefully structured explanation to the test. When we first spoke, prior to her coming out as trans, she told me she simply hadn't had to deal with that much online harassment. That's no longer the case. “Almost as soon as I came out as trans there was a spike in online harassment more vicious than anything I'd experienced before,” she said. “It turns out there are many people who spend a good portion of their spare time making life as miserable as possible for trans people. I've been doxed. I've been harassed. I've been stalked. I've had every public pre-transition photo of me compiled alongside my deadname with the purpose of never letting me be my true gender.”
Still, Contra said that at the end of the day, she isn't vulnerable to this sort of harassment as some people are — she makes money from her fans directly and has long had a flamboyantly open persona anyway — and remains dedicated to talking about her transition process honestly. “I am trying to chronicle my transition with as much accuracy as possible,” she said. “My goal is to describe the specific details of my transition, rather than a generic transition narrative. The benefit of this approach for me is that it's like a kind of confession or diary — I don't have to keep my feelings to myself. But I hope it also benefits other people in that (1) trans people will recognize themselves in my story and feel less alone, and (2) cis people will gain a deeper and more sympathetic understanding of the experience of someone going through gender dysphoria and transition.” She plans on producing some sequels to her 14-minute short film “Gender Dysphoria” — an abstract look at what it has been like for her to navigate the condition.
Despite all of her success so far, and her belief that she has found an effective model for discussing controversial and misunderstood issues on YouTube, Contra did express a bit of ambivalence about that model. Some people really are able to talk about these issues in a super-earnest, straightforward way, without dick jokes or self-deprecation. And they get beaten down online as a punishment for their earnestness — usually a lot worse than Contra herself has been. “I am maybe not that brave,” she said, “and in some ways maybe my videos are a little cowardly in the sense that I'm always hiding behind … in some ways I'm borrowing the playbook of the alt-right. I'm using irony as a shield. I'm using jokes and memes.” Here, I push back a little: Isn't that just who you are? Maybe you just aren't wired to talk about stuff in a straightforwardly sincere way. “That's true, too,” she said. “Some of it is just a genuine expression of my personality. I'm not really the type of person who is going to make heartfelt 20-minute vlogs. That's just not really who I am.”

At the PHP Benelux conference James Titcumb did a presentation on the BetterReflection library he's working on. You can view the slides of his presentation on SlideShare.
The BetterReflection library has a few advantages over PHP's native reflection capabilities (copied from the docs):
you can reflect on classes that are not already loaded, without loading them
ability to reflect on classes directly from a string of PHP code
better Reflection analyses the DocBlocks (using phpdocumentor/type-resolver)
reflecting directly on closures
When this pull request will get merged the library even makes it possible to monkey patch classes. Let's take a look how you would do that.
Consider this class:
class MonkeyPatchMe { function getMessage () : string { return 'hello everybody' ; } }
The body of the getMessage -function can be replaced using this code:
$classInfo = ReflectionClass::createFromName( 'MonkeyPatchMe' ); $methodInfo = $classInfo->getMethod( 'getMessage' ); $methodInfo->setBody( function () { return 'bye everybody' ; }); $monkeyPatchedClass = new MonkeyPatchMe(); $monkeyPatchedClass->getMessage()
Behind the scenes this voodoo works by copying the original class to another file, doing a replacement of the function body there and loading up that class.
I'll be keeping my eye on how the BetterReflection library evolves. You can read all about it's current functionality in the docs on GitHub.
Mayoral candidate Doug Ford (open Doug Ford's poilcard) held a Wednesday news conference at the headquarters of the Toronto Real Estate Board to discuss his plan to cut the land transfer tax by 60 per cent. After Ford finished taking questions, the board's chief government and public affairs officer, Von Palmer, stepped up to the microphone himself. Other board officials, including president Paul Etherington, watched from the side.
Toronto's land transfer tax and realtors fees were questioned during a news conference at the headquarters of the Toronto Real Estate Board. ( SUSAN PIGG / TORONTO STAR )
After various questions about Ford's proposal, James Tumelty, senior camera operator for Citytv, calmly asked Palmer a series of questions about realtors' commissions. Etherington did not enjoy them. A transcript of the three-man exchange, some of which was inaudible on tape:
Article Continued Below
Tumelty: “For all the reasons that you said the land transfer tax hurts seniors…and for the reason that real estate prices have grown considerably…should real estate commissions be reduced too?” Palmer: “I don't think that's a topic of discussion.” Tumelty: “That's the lion's share…it's that real estate commission.” Palmer: “Right. There are some who choose to attack realtors in this process. Realtors are not the problem.” Tumelty: “I'm not attacking, just asking a question.”
Palmer: “Fair enough. But the homebuyer pays the tax. People don't work for free, by the way. Realtors provide a service. You have a choice to use a realtor or not use a realtor. But let's not run away from the facts, though: the homebuyer pays the tax. That is the problem, because those are the people that are hurt. So it's not a question of commissions or what we give up. The question is who's hurt by this tax and who benefits when you start to take it out.”

Tumelty: “Same idea when they don't have to pay the real estate fees.” Etherington (interjecting from side): “You know what? That's an inappropriate question. Who pays for you. Let's end this conversation now, thank you.” Reporter: “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He's allowed to ask a question.” Etherington: “Thank you very much. Inappropriate competition question. Not appropriate for this. Thank you very much. “ Reporter: “Sir, who are — you're regulating the press conferences? If he wants to ask a question he can ask a question.” Etherington: “Not a question that might be anti-competitive. And it's not a proper question for here. Thank you very much.” Reporter: “Sir, who are you?” Etherington: “I'm the president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, Paul Etherington.”
Peter Didyk, Pioneer's director of sales and marketing, with the company's new products for helping the rib cage of cardiac surgery patients fuse and heal more quickly.
MARQUETTE (WWJ) — I haven't been to Marquette on the Tech Tour for four years now. And as I recall, the last time I was here it was snowing. In May.
Well, this time, a cold rain gave way to springlike sunshine and temperatures in the 50s, surely an omen for the warm greeting I got Friday from my first interviews as the 10th annual Spring Tech Tour began.
Things got off to a rousing start at Pioneer Surgical Technology Inc., a high tech medical device manufacturer that is growing rapidly and expanding nationwide.
Pioneer was founded in 1992 by Marquette surgeon Matthew Songer and its first major proudct was the Songer Cable, used in spine injuries.
Since then, the company has expanded into other surgical products for the spine, orthopedic, cardiac and thoracic markets, as well as biologics — living products — used to promote bone healing.
“Last year we observed our 20th anniversary, which for a medical manufacturer is remarkable,” said Peter Didyk, Pioneer's director of sales and marketing. “Most of the time you are either acquired, sold or go public by then — even Johnson & Johnson is not safe.”
Pioneer has grown by both designing new products and by acquisition. In 2007, Pioneer acquired Angstrom Medica, a Massachusetts based medical company focused on nanotechnology and Encelle, North Carolina based company researching and developing tissue regeneration products. Songer left active management about three years ago but remains an investor. Today the company is led by Daniel H. Webber, CEO, a CPA and former real estate and automotive executive.
Pioneer's 125,000-square-foot headquarters factory is an amazing technological tour de force, from clean room and sterile products reminiscent of MichBio's most advanced members to highly advanced computer controlled metalworking equipment that would make any Detroit Three gearhead smile.
The company manufactures spinal and cardio-thoracic surgery products under its own name, as well as biologics that combine the technologies of Angstrom and Encelle — a crystalline form of calcium that, when combined with a patient's own bone marrow and bone cells, promotes new bone growth.
Its most recent product line, “Tritium,” combines the two most used methods of closing a patient's rib cage after open-heart surgery — a stamped titanium plate that is affixed to the two halves of the rib cage with screws, and high-tech titanium wire.
Didyk and colleague Jamie Close came up with the design on a napkin in a brainstorming session in January 2012 and took it to Pioneer's prototype machine shop. The FDA approved the device in October, and the first surgery using it took place in December.
That's the kind of entreprneuerial spirit that has kept Pioneer growing, to 300 employees and offices in four states, the Netherlands and Germany.
Didyk said Pioneer operates by three rules — make treatment better for the patient, faster and easier for the surgeon, and cheaper for the health care system.
And he said that while it's a challenge to recruit to the remote Upper Peninsula, the company remains committed to growing in the UP. Besides, there are people like him — who went to high school in Dearborn and got a biomedical engineering degree at the UP's Michigan Tech before getting an MBA at Michigan — who are eager to return to the North Woods and still have a challenging tech career.
After Pioneer, I swung over to Marquette's west side and the new offices of 906 Technologies, a jack-of-all-trades IT company founded in 2005 by Lee Francisco.
Francisco grew up in the UP town of Amasa and came to Northern Michigan University in Marquette in 1998 to study business and computer information systems. NMU hired him full-time before he finished school as a PC technician, a job he would hold from 2001 to 2009. He founded 906 Technologies — its name taken from the UP's area code — in 2005 “because so many people asked if I did anything on the side.”
By 2009, Francisco said, 906 Technologies had grown to five full-time employees, and running it was also a full-time job, “so I had a decision to make. In 2009, I quit the university.”
906 has continued to grow since then. Today it's at 24 employees, split about evenly between the company's computer repair and maintenance operation and its application development shop, in 4,000 square feet.
“And we are hiring now — we are always looking for people,” Francisco said.
Francisco said 906's app development shop isn't bound by geography, “so we're able to work across the country and around the world. We've done mobile app development for Fortune 100 companies and Web site development for national businesses.”
One intriguing app Francisco is working on is called the Penny App.
“It's a charity app that will allow anyone to be able to donate anything, as little as a penny, to the charity of their choice, whenever they want,” Francisco said. “Most charities don't want to accept pennies, nickels, dimes, The process we are patenting allows charities to do that, accumulate it, and then the charity will get a check at the end of the month.”
Believe it or not, Francisco said, “the hard part is getting charities to accept it. I would never have thought this, but we have been turned down by numerous national charities.” Why? Francisco said they've told him they “aren't set up for something like this, or it doesn't fit their business model — which I thought was insane, because which nonprofit doesn't have a business plan that accepts money?”
Francisco said the beta version of the Penny App includes local Marquette-area charities, like UPaws, an animal shelter, and the UP Children's Museum, who are happy to have the money. The app also includes built-in games and entertainment. And he says he wants to get celebrities to use the app to raise money for their pet charities.
Francisco said he wants to keep growing 906 so that it can fulfill what he said was a major mission: “Our goal was keeping the talent that wants to stay in the UP in the UP. Otherwise, a majority of people hightail it for a city, because they think that's where the jobs are, or that's the only place they will get a chance to work on large projects … I would love to have our own products and make an impact. I see this almost as an incubator, where we take people with little or no experience coming out of college and give them the opportunity to work on projects right in Marquette that they couldn't get elsewhere.”
From there it was back to downtown Marquette and Getz's, that most unusual business — an old-fashioned downtown department store that's actually survived into the 2010s.
How has Getz done it? By embracing the Internet. At one point, nearly two-thirds of Getz's revenue came online, where Getz's was among the planet's top sellers of Carhartt rugged work wear, the stuff that's also popular with a younger, urban audience.
But all is not sweetness and light by the shores of Lake Superior. Getz's manager Dennis Mingay told me that things are getting ever tougher and more competitive, as other businesses, including the clothing manufacturers themselves, get into the online sales business.
“This year it'll probably be more like 50-50 between online and the store,” Mingay said.
Not only that, but shipping costs are rocketing — up 50 percent over the past five years, Mingay said. And more and more shoppers expect free shipping, which Getz's offers on all orders $50 and up.
Then, of course, there's Congress, moving toward requiring online retailers to collect state sales taxes for the jurisdictions of their customers.
“It's become much more competitive, much tougher,” Mingay said. We're looking at it closely for costs. And we're trying to control our pay-per-click (online advertising) costs as well.”
Luckily, though, Mingay said Getz's store continues to perform well. And it's amazing selection is as good as ever — virtually every SKU from Levi's and Carhartt is available on the store's three floors.
And with that, my first half-day in Marquette came to an end. Now it's off to commit a little journalism and rest up for a busy Saturday.
Software death-cycle is not a new term, but most people use it in a way that implies a problem with a given project's adherence to the software life-cycle, a project which is launched but quickly becomes obsolete or perhaps is unusable to begin with.
The software death cycle I'm talking about happens long before a project is launched, and has nothing to do with adherence to the software life cycle. Specifically, I'm referring to projects that fall to the back-burner, either because other more exciting projects come about or because the project simply became less interesting as time went on.
Whatever the reason, when a project dies before it's even launched, there are a significant amount of man-hours lost. Perhaps some experience is gained, but it typically doesn't outweigh the amount of hours flushed when a project is abandoned.
Why projects are abandoned
Before we try to solve the problem of abandoned projects, let's identify a few reasons why it happens in the first place:
A more time-sensitive, exciting or lucrative project comes along The project became less interesting or challenging The project hit a long stretch of grunt work The project ran into a technical snag which was difficult to solve The scope of the project ended up being much larger than originally anticipated
A new project comes along
It's understandable that a new project would take priority over a project already in the works. However, depending on the size of the project, putting all efforts towards the new project essentially forces the current project to the shelf to collect dust. But no problem, right? We'll just pick up where we left off when this project is completed. If you've ever tried doing this, you know it's not as easy as it sounds. When a project sits on the shelf, the following things can happen:
The inner workings are forgotten.
You didn't have a solid project specification or your code isn't well documented on a high level. These are important, but get overlooked, especially in single-developer projects. Most of my projects are single-developer (myself), so when I feel the heat of another project coming around the corner, I typically go back and write a quick paragraph of comments in each major class or template – kind of "Hey, remember this" note to myself.

New technologies or software emerges, making much of the code obsolete .
I develop an entire application based on jQuery 1.7, then need to let it sit for a couple months while I work on a different project. By then, jQuery 1.9 comes out and I'm using it full force. I really don't have a big interest in coming back to my jQuery 1.7 project and unlearning all my new tricks. The solution to this problem is to review the documentation of the newer version of the library you're using. Check the list of features that were removed since the older version, then use your IDE's file search tool to locate any occurrences of those deprecated features and replace them with their newer counterparts.

You'll need to contact the former developer of the project, so he or she can get you up to speed. Trying to wrap your head around everything without a high-level overview will be difficult. Also, you may miss some of the nuances which are not well documented. Ask for a functional specification, or if possible, compensate the person as a freelancer to oversee the completion of the project.

Ask for a functional specification, or if possible, compensate the person as a freelancer to oversee the completion of the project. The code is well documented, but the developers can't recall what was required to bring the project to completion.
This is another one that requires a little pre-emptive work on your part. It's actually a lot easier than going back and documenting the code, post-development. What I do is, before starting on the next project, quickly draw up a list of all of the features that were currently in development (include filenames & line numbers if it helps). I also make a separate list of all the features that have not been started yet, but are required for the finished product. One great way to do this is to use BaseCamp or another project management tool. Create a new project, then a drop in a bunch of to-do items. This serves the alternate purpose of reminding you later that this project has not gone away, there are still active to-dos on the list!
Loss of Interest
This problem is compounded when it's a personal project, as there's no immediate financial motivation to keep the ball moving. In the past, I've taken one of two approaches to work through this problem:
Make the project more interesting
This could be as simple as slapping a design on it. Many times I find myself working out the internals of a project, looking at nothing but a "data dump". Putting a simple design on the application breathes a little bit of life into it. If that isn't the way to go, try applying a new methodology. For instance, if you were taking a procedural approach, try sprinkling in a little objected-oriented code. This is typically not a good practice, as it breaks down the consistency of your code, but anything is better than watching your project become dust in the wind due to lack of interest.
This could be as simple as slapping a design on it. Many times I find myself working out the internals of a project, looking at nothing but a "data dump". Putting a simple design on the application breathes a little bit of life into it. Force yourself to devote time to it
This is important, if you spend too much time away from the project, you'll lose your mental grasp on it. By spending just a few minutes a day to, say, write a basic routine or create some pseudo-code, you maintain just enough involvement to maintain your understanding of the code.
Danger, grunt work ahead
This bears some similarity to the issue mentioned above, the project becomes less interesting, except that you typically know in advance that there will be some grunt work. But, the time comes where the brain drain has to happen, and instead of pushing through it, you move on to a more interesting project.
You typically have three options when it comes to the mind-numbing, data-entry-like work that's required to complete your project:
Outsource it
Elance might be a good place to find low-cost work that doesn't require detailed knowledge of the inner working of your application.
Automate it
Many times, writing a script to automate the data entry task is both a time-saver, and an interesting task in it's own right.
Do it
As mentioned above, set aside a few minutes each day to plug in the data manually.
Technical snag – pause, don't stop!
I don't think the term snag is appropriately used, but that's the term everyone understands. To me, a snag is something that stops you in your tracks, but also destroys whatever got snagged. Your keyboard does not rip or tear when you hit a technical snag. How about glue? I got stuck in some techno-glue!
Regardless of the term, there are typically two reasons you walk away from a project when you get stuck:
To clear your head so you can return at a later time using a different approach.
This is acceptable, and probably recommended.
You don't want to deal with the issue, so you put the project aside.
This, of course, is bad news. The problem is compounded as time goes on and you forget about the details surrounding the issue. If you absolutely can't spend any more time to resolve the issue in the foreseeable future, you need to document it. I personally like to drop in a highly emphasized comment in my index file, default method, main controller, or whatever your application considers to be it's point of entry. For example:
/* !!!! ISSUE !!!!
load.php - line 242 - Can't figure out why a FileNotFound error
happens whenever I try to load the config file.
This needs to be fixed before further testing can be done on app initialization. */
Scope bloat
Scope bloat sounds disgusting, but scope expansion isn't near as memorable. I like to think of it as what happens when you open up one of those memory foam cushions, then a week later it's the size of your living room. You may have made accommodations based on it's shipping dimensions but didn't dig deep enough to find it's dimensions when fully expanded.
The same thing happens when you don't write up a technical specification for your application. If you come up with a mental model, you may think you've covered all the bases, and certain components may seem simpler than they actually are. You're doing yourself a big favor by spending even an hour laying out all of the major classes that you consider necessary in your project. Then, if you have time, detail the public methods and properties that the major classes will contain. This will help you conceptualize how the classes will work together. I personally want to get started coding a project just as quickly as the next guy, so I understand the hurry. For that reason, I know it makes more sense to be realistic about the planning phase. A single developer working on a small project simply does not want to waste too much time on a technical or functional spec. But, you should at least get something down on paper, you'll be amazed at what you reveal, and how much you actually learn about the true scope of your project.
Additional Tips
Keep a running list of your projects somewhere, BaseCamp, or any other project management tool. You really want to make sure none of your projects are left behind – it's just wasted time.
Don't start a project without knowing what your plan is when it's finished. If your project is for other people to use, how will they learn about it? Do you have a plan to get the word out, and does your plan usually work? If you typically drop the ball in this phase, and end up with a whole bunch of great applications that nobody knows about, reconsider the time you spend on these projects.
Other things to consider before starting a new project
Following a winning January, the Buffalo Sabres have some fans asking if the team will be buyers come the NHL trade deadline. We examine the possibility.
Since 2016 said its adieus, the Buffalo Sabres have been a team worth watching (for the most part).
A record of 7-5-1 in the month of January. 42 goals scored and 40 goals allowed, meaning the Sabres averaged 3.23 goals per game and were actually +2 on the month.
Article continues below ...
Not the sort of numbers that will blow you away, granted, but remember: at one point this season, the Buffalo Sabres were the only team in the NHL who were averaging less than two goals per game.
Buffalo's surge has not had much of an impact on the standings (Buffalo is tied with Tampa Bay for last place in the Eastern Conference) but it has given fans a reason to keep tuning into games: with 52 points, the Sabres are just 6 points back of the 8th-in-the-East Boston Bruins.
Six points? That's nothing, right? Let's see if GM Tim Murray can get on the phone, swing a trade that brings another scoring forward, or maybe a top-4 defenseman like Tyson Barie or Shea Theodore, into the 716 and . . .
Cool your jets there, young one. You're getting ahead of yourself.
Six points sounds like no big deal – just three wins! – but the Buffalo Sabres would need to win three more games than the Boston Bruins in February just to tie them, meaning that if Boston goes .500 on the month (5-5-0), Buffalo needs to win 8 out of their 14 games this month just to be tied with the Bruins.
Again, that might be doable – but we have not even started discussing the Toronto Maple Leafs, who are currently only one point behind the Bruins. Or the Florida Panthers, who are only two points back. Or the Carolina Hurricanes, New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils – you get the point.
I hope.
The Buffalo Sabres not only have to win three more games than Boston to creep into the playoff race, but hope they also post better records than all six of the teams that currently make up the 9-14 spots in the East.
Sorry, readers: that is just not likely to happen.
If you want to use Super Bowl 51 as inspiration, go right ahead: don't mistake my stating what I think will happen for what I wish would happen. I sincerely HOPE the Buffalo Sabres can play winning hockey the remainder of the 2016-17 season and find themselves in a playoff spot, but I don't honestly believe it will happen. If it was just the number of points that the Sabres had to overcome, things might not look so bleak . . . but having to catch no less than seven other teams makes this Mission Impossible.
So the bottom line: if you are looking for the Buffalo Sabre to become buyers, you are certainly a glass-half-full kind of person. If the Sabres tear up February to the tune of 10-2-2, you will have my attention . . . but even then, any moves the team makes will be minor tweaks, as GMTM is not going to sell his prospects in a desperate swing for the fences. If Buffalo enters March having only sold a spare part or two, I would take that as a great sign of progress.

“We are outraged by this behavior,” a spokespirate told TorrentFreak. “People must understand what is right and wrong. Stealing material like this on the Internet is a threat to economies worldwide.” That's an accusation oft-leveled at TPB. “We feel that we must make a statement and therefore we will sure them for copyright infringement. If not even IFPI and their friends can respect copyright, perhaps it's time to move on?”
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry is a music lobby group that teamed up with the CIAPC to sue the Pirate Bay in Finland in 2011. The CIAPC made international headlines in November when they raided the home of a 9-year-old girl who'd shared an album via TPB. Police famously confiscated her Winnie the Pooh laptop and her father ultimately had to settle by paying the Finnish group 300 Euros.
Now that the United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union, African economies—already struggling from slowing demand from China and flat commodity prices—have now been thrown into confusion along with the rest of the world.
“Many emerging market and frontier asset markets will come under pressure,” Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa for Standard Chartered Bank, tells Quartz. “Much will depend on how quickly some sort of financial market stability can be restored.”
The UK's minister for Africa and advocate for leaving, James Duddridge, has promised that relations with the continent would only improve without the burden of the EU, but Africa's largest economies are still likely to suffer.
South Africa's rand and trade
South Africa's already battered economy may be the worst affected by Britain's exit. As it became clear that the UK vote had swung toward leaving, the rand plunged during early morning trading, becoming the worst performing currency after the British pound. As of mid-morning the rand had fallen more than 7%, its steepest single-day decline since the 2008 financial crisis.
Along with their peers on the London Stock Exchange, major South African companies dual-listed in London and Johannesburg are being hammered. South Africa's close financial ties to the UK could be a problem—British banks' claims on South African entities account for 178% of South Africa's foreign currency reserves, according to analysts from UniCredit.
Economists also worry that trade between Africa's most industrialized economy and the UK will suffer. (The UK is the fourth largest destination for exports from the country, according to data from Bloomberg.) Economists at the South African university, North-West, have said Brexit could take 0.1 percentage points off of the country's annual economic growth, which already contracted 1.2% in the first quarter of this year.
Nigeria: bad timing
Britain's exit from the EU couldn't have come at the worst time for Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. At a time when the government is trying to fix an economy on the brink of a recession by removing strict currency controls and also liberalizing oil prices, the immediate effect of Brexit will test the nerves of Nigeria's economic managers as global markets plummet.
Bilateral trade between Nigeria and the UK, currently valued at £6 billion (about $8.3 billion) and projected to reach £20 billion by 2020, will be disrupted as trade agreements made under the auspices of the EU have to be renegotiated.
“For Nigeria, global risk aversion as well as a softer oil price is likely to mean that new portfolio inflows are slow to materialize,” says Khan. “This may delay the normal functioning of the newly liberalized FX market.”
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows that the UK was Nigeria's largest source of foreign investment in 2015. A slowing British economy and its reverberating effects could signal a drop in investment, trade, and also remittances from the Nigerian diaspora who sent home $21 billion in 2015.
Reduced trade and investment from Britain will not necessarily be plugged by the rest of the EU, say Lagos-based economist Tunji Andrews. “The EU will be looking to strengthen it's internal ties, plus there's cheaper oil from Iran, cheaper labor from China and the eastern block. There's really nothing we have as a competitive advantage to them right now.”
Brexit is already fueling other independence campaigns. Within hours of the vote, leaders in France and Holland, Italy and Denmark called for their own referendums on leaving the EU. This sentiment is shared in southeast Nigeria as well, where government forces have spent much of the past year quelling violent protests by activists advocating for the secession and establishment of an independent country called Biafra. Having already called for a referendum earlier in the year, pro-Biafra activists may now be further emboldened.
Kenya's cut flowers
Kenya faces capital flight as investors seek safe havens like US treasuries, falling exports, and pressure on the Kenyan shilling. “It's going to affect all of us and there's no insurance, no position we can take to maneuver ourselves to be in a better position,” central bank head Patrick Njoroge, said last month of the possibility of the UK leaving the EU.
For now, the bank says it is prepared to handle any shocks with foreign reserves of 560 billion Kenyan shillings ($5.6billion), enough to cover five months of imports. Still, a weaker Kenyan shilling will make imports more expensive for a country whose import bill has been increasing more than 10% a year over the last five years.
One of Kenya's top exports, cut flowers, could suffer, according to the Kenya Flowers Association. Over a third of the EU's cut flower imports come from the East African country. And the UK and the Netherlands, another country threatening to leave the EU, are the top destinations for Kenyan exports, mainly flowers. If a trade deal between the East African Community and the EU is stalled because of Brexit, Kenya would be looking at a loss of 4 billion Kenyan shillings a month, according to the association.
Renegotiating trade deals is likely to “create more uncertainty for Kenyan exports,” according to Khan of Standard Chartered. Falling demand as a result of a slowdown or return to recession in the UK and the EU would also be bad for Kenyan trade.
But it's not all bad news. Kenya's ties with Britain are deep and longstanding so bilateral trade and investment are likely to continue. In some ways Kenya could even benefit, according to some analysts. The UK may be eager to establish bilateral ties after leaving the EU, giving Kenya leverage.
The end of “British Outwardness”
Other countries on the continent are bound to be affected as well. In Egypt, the main stock index fell 1.3%, with investors worrying about a loss of British investment and demand for Egyptian exports. The central bank of Mauritius issued a statement today (June 24th) that it had raised its reserves of gold and US dollars to reduce exposure to the pound. “Should the need arise, the bank stands ready to take measures as appropriate to protect the best economic interests of Mauritius in the circumstance,” the regulator said.
Analysts question how Brexit will affect the EU's support of agricultural subsidies, which critics say have hurt African farmers. The UK has been one of the bloc's most staunch opponents of these subsidies. African countries may also have less access to international capital markets and big infrastructure projects may have to be put on hold, according to Khan.
More broadly, analysts from Brookings Institution worry about how Brexit will affect the UK's overall engagement with Africa. As head of the G8 last year, the UK pledged to double aid to Africa. The UK has been the largest funder to IDA17, the World Bank's concessional borrowing program.
The think tank concluded in a blog post, ”Perhaps the biggest impact of the Brexit on Africa would be the end of British “outwardness”—the country's concern with and responsiveness to global development issues.”
The Australian government will pay out $53 million in compensation to 1,905 asylum seekers who filed a lawsuit over the treatment they received in detention camps.
Court procedures were scheduled to begin Wednesday but the government made a last-minute settlement offer to avoid negative attention. The government said it “strongly denied” allegations but that a settlement is the “prudent” decision.
Australia is known for its hardline immigration policies and indefinite detention of people who attempt to enter the country illegally. The asylum seekers claim they've suffered physical and psychological harm on the Manaus Island detention center between 2012 and 2016. The detention center is scheduled to close in October after a court ruled its operations are “illegal and unconstitutional.”
“While no amount of money could fully recognize the terrible conditions the detainees endured, we hope today's settlement can begin to provide them with an opportunity to help put this dark chapter of their lives behind them,” Andrew Baker, the plaintiffs' legal representative said in a statement.
The negative attention has not stopped Australia from continuing its hardline immigration approach. Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton announced a crackdown May 21 on “fake refugees” who arrived illegally by boat. (RELATED: Australia Says The ‘Game's Up' For ‘Fake Refugees)
Dutton said 7,500 out of the 50,000 people who have arrived by boat in recent years refused to provide any documents of their identity. The government has given illegal immigrants until Oct. 1 to prove they are legitimate refugees or face deportation from the country.
“Those people who are fake refugees – people who are refusing to provide detail about their claim of protection … we are going to set a deadline for those people, and we have set that deadline for the end of this year in October,” Dutton said, according to 9 News.

THE MORNING PLUM:
Let's be clear about this: President Trump regularly goes out of his way to attack prominent African Americans not just to “stoke the culture wars,” as this euphemism often has it — but, more precisely, to stoke the sense among many of his supporters that the system is unfairly rigged on behalf of minorities, and that he's here to put things right.
This morning, Trump once again tweeted angrily about LaVar Ball, the father of a UCLA basketball player who, along with two others, had been released by China after getting arrested for shoplifting. But what's particularly noteworthy is that only minutes later Trump then tweeted about kneeling football players. What's the connection there? Here's Trump's tweetstorm:
It wasn't the White House, it wasn't the State Department, it wasn't father LaVar's so-called people on the ground in China that got his son out of a long term prison sentence — IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man's version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It's a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool! The NFL is now thinking about a new idea — keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That's almost as bad as kneeling! When will they highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!
Ball had previously refused to thank Trump, and the president had responded by tweeting that “I should have left them in jail!” Today's tweets go further, suggesting Ball was insufficiently thankful to Trump personally for actions that are expected of U.S. presidential administrations.
The immediate segue to kneeling football players is suggestive, and reminds us that we're seeing a pattern in Trump's public flaying of prominent African Americans. It is true that in some of these cases, Trump was attacked or at least criticized first. But it's hard to avoid noticing a gratuitously ugly pattern in Trump's responses, in which Trump vaguely suggests either that his targets are getting above their station, or that they're asking for too much and are insufficiently thankful for all that has been done for them.
Kneeling football players are protesting structural racism, hideously unfair racist prison sentencing disparities, and police brutality — i.e., profound injustices that our society inflicts on countless African Americans who have not enjoyed the success that star black athletes have, sometimes to the point of having lost large chunks of their lives to imprisonment or having been wrongfully killed in their youth. But Trump has regularly depicted the players as “disrespectful,” as if questioning this country's continued deeply ingrained injustices is itself an act of impudence. He has repeatedly labeled the players “privileged,” as if they've got no business complaining or that their achievements are vaguely suspect.
When Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) relayed that Trump had offended one of her constituents, a war widow, Trump accused her of “secretly” listening in on the call, as if she had rigged the game for self-promotional purposes, rendering him the aggrieved party. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly called her an “empty barrel” (a showboat and a hot dog), and put her in her place by accusing her of disrespecting the military. Kelly also falsely accused her of rigging a federal kickback to her district by calling up President Barack Obama (hint, hint). Kelly refused to apologize for this lie, because the details were irrelevant to the larger truism that the impudent, disrespectful loudmouth had actually gotten the appropriate smackdown that was coming to her.
Many black women see a documentable pattern in those attacks on one of their own. Now LaVar Ball is an “ungrateful fool,” as if Ball has benefited from Trump's benevolence — rather than from his administration's institutional responsibility — without showing sufficient gratitude for it.
Writing in the Atlantic this week, Adam Serwer suggested that Trump's frequent race-baiting has two crucial components. First, there's the ongoing suggestion that minorities enjoy various special privileges that unfairly rig the game against struggling white people, which Trump will reverse with justifiably discriminatory policies. (Polling has suggested many Trump voters did believe that such special privileges were harming whites.) Second, there's the crucial ingredient of deniability — the simultaneous notion that Trump is entirely innocent of any racially discriminatory motives, and even that the very suggestion otherwise constitutes another injustice heaped upon Trump and his supporters.
Trump once again attacked a prominent African American today. But, hey, the guy had it coming. Also, it would be deeply unfair to Trump to suggest that this constitutes a pattern of race-baiting on his part, and deeply unfair to his supporters to suggest that such a pattern might be designed to resonate with them, if that pattern existed at all, which it doesn't.
* DEAD HEAT IN ALABAMA: A new WBRC-TV/Strategy Research poll finds Roy Moore edging Doug Jones in the Alabama Senate race by a scant two points, 47-45, down from 11 points earlier this month. And:
When asked “what do you think about the allegations made against Roy Moore,” 45% believe all or some of the allegations; 34% do not believe the allegations; and 21% believe some or all of the allegations, but say it has not changed their vote. … Nearly half (48%) of Republican voters surveyed do not believe the allegations. Another 24% of Republicans say they believe some or all of the allegations, but it has not changed their vote.
The polling averages have Jones up by 0.8 points. For him to win, Democrats — particularly African Americans — will have to be unusually energized, even as some Republicans stay home.
* TRUMP PUTS GOP IN ‘DIFFICULT POSITION' ON ROY MOORE: On Tuesday, Trump seemed to endorse Moore, blithely saying he had denied the charges, and the New York Times reports this nugget:
Party officials have worried that their connections to Mr. Moore … would taint establishment candidates across the country. Senate Republicans said on Tuesday that they were bewildered by Mr. Trump's weighing in on the Alabama race after he had remained quiet, and they said that the president had put them in a difficult position.
Republicans will no doubt be glad to keep the seat, but if Moore wins, his lunacy and extremism in the Senate next year could conceivably have an impact on the midterms.
* MUELLER EYES KUSHNER ROLE IN COMEY FIRING: The Wall Street Journal reports that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's team is looking hard at Jared Kushner's involvement in Trump's firing of former FBI director James B. Comey:
Mr. Mueller's prosecutors have asked witnesses detailed questions about … whether Mr. Kushner was in favor of firing him or had staked out a position, said the people familiar with the matter. … Mr. Kushner pushed for Mr. Comey's firing in discussions among the president and his top advisers, according to four people familiar with the matter. … Another person said top White House aides, including Mr. Kushner, viewed Mr. Comey as too unpredictable following his handling of the Clinton probe.
“Too unpredictable”? How so?
* DEMOCRATS LAUNCH BIG AD BLITZ: Reuters reports that multiple Democrat-aligned groups are launching ads bashing the GOP tax plan for cutting taxes on the rich and corporations while raising them on many middle-class Americans:
Democratic advocacy group Priorities USA [has] increased to $2 million a tax-related digital ad campaign targeting voters in 20 House districts where Republicans voted for the House bill. … The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads in more than 40 Republican-held House districts. The group Save My Care is running digital ads in the districts of 14 House Republicans who voted for the bill, and in Alaska, Arizona and Maine.
One thing to keep an eye on: The degree to which Democrats use the GOP tax bill to target GOP-held districts that are heavy on working-class whites, who can hopefully be turned against it.
* REPUBLICANS ‘HAVE IT BOTH WAYS' ON TAXES: Bloomberg makes a good point about the repeal of the individual mandate in the Senate tax bill: Republicans claim both that this won't lead millions to be uninsured, and that mandate repeal will save lots of money:
This leaves Republicans in an awkward spot. While they crave the savings that come from repealing the mandate, they don't love the reason why — namely, millions fewer people would be insured. … Republicans are trying to have it both ways.
The whole point of repealing the mandate is so millions fewer get covered, cutting government spending on subsidies and Medicaid, thus funding corporate tax cuts that benefit the wealthy.
* MILLIONS WILL SEE A TAX HIKE: Axios reports on the findings of a new Commonwealth Fund study that tries to gauge the impact of the Senate bill's repeal of the mandate, which would cause premiums to soar:
Some people's tax cuts under the GOP Senate bill would be canceled out by the increased premiums they would face. … And, for those roughly 7 million people who buy insurance on their own but don't get premium subsidies, high health care costs would endure even after the bill's tax cuts expire. … The bill would leave millions of middle-income Americans worse off financially.
This should further turn Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) against the bill, since this is the outcome she has explicitly warned about.
* AND A TIMELINE OF SEXUAL CHARGES AGAINST TRUMP: Post fact checker Meg Kelly compiles an astonishingly comprehensive list of all the people that say Trump made unwanted sexual advances, as well as people who were told about them at the time. As Kelly notes:
Many of the women have produced witnesses who say they heard about these incidents when they happened — long before Trump's political aspirations were known. Three have produced at least two witnesses. Such contemporaneous accounts are essential to establishing the credibility of the allegation because they reduce the chance that a person is making up a story for political purposes.
But, as Trump said of Roy Moore, “he denies it,” which settles the matter.
The energy consumption of refugee camps has been neglected by international governments and humanitarian agencies, costing an estimated $2bn annually, according to a consortium of NGOs and think tanks. EURACTIV's partner Edie.net reports.
The Chatham House Report for the Moving Energy Initiative highlights that there are now 60 million forcibly displaced people living across the globe. These people used around 3.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent, predominantly in the form of firewood and charcoal for heating and cooking.
These inefficient fuels cost around $2bn annually and generate 13 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The subsequent air pollution could be killing 20,000 each year.
Speaking at the launch of the report, Chatham House senior researcher Glada Lahn said: “This is as an energy access problem. These displaced people and refugees are part of the 2.9 billion living in energy poverty around the world, but the sustainable development goals and the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative didn't mention them. They are a grey area.”
Widening gap
The report warns that the gap between the needs of growing numbers of displaced people and the resources and political will to meet these needs is widening. The majority of camps rely on inefficient techniques to burn biomass like wood which emits 4.54 tCO2 per tonne of oil equivalent, compared with 2.79 tCO2 from burning an equivalent amount of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
The report recommends a widespread introduction of improved cooking stoves and basic solar lanterns as a means of saving $323m a year in fuel costs, although this would require a one-off payment of $335m to implement. This could also result in emissions savings of 6.85m tCO2 per year.
Long-term thinking
The report states that short-term, politically-orientated humanitarian funding is inadequate to finance long-term energy solutions. To combat this, the report suggests humanitarian agencies create a fund for energy infrastructure.
Appealing to the private sector and climate related funding are two possible avenues of exploration in an attempt to implement the ideal scenario solar grids and more permanent renewable energy infrastructure in every camp, along with those with the expertise to use them.
The report also recommends that refugee camps' energy needs should be affiliated with existing government policies so that national projects benefit the displaced as well as the locals.
Water stress
Growing water scarcity could add to the 60 million forcefully displaced, with the World Resources Institute reporting that 33 countries could be at risk from water-stress by 2040. Of the countries, 14 are from the Middle East where many will move to increasingly overcrowded cities.
Climate change has already led to the creation of the world's first ‘climate refugee' who was recently deported from New Zealand, despite launching a legal appeal that his home country Kiribati was threatened by rising sea-levels.

More memos recently have surfaced that were written early in the Bush administration by John C. Yoo from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel — the man who gave us the administration's horrifyingly narrow definition of torture. As difficult as it is to believe, the recently released memos are even scarier than the original torture memo.
Yoo boldly asserts that the president's power during wartime is nearly unlimited. For example, he argues that Congress has no right to pass laws governing the interrogations of enemy combatants and the commander-in-chief can ignore such laws if passed, and can, without constraint, seize oceangoing ships.
The memos also argue that military operations in the United States against terrorists are not subject to the Fourth Amendment requirement for search warrants or the Fifth Amendment requirement for due process.
This broad interpretation of executive power and the president's commander-in-chief role would make the nation's founders jump out of their graves. Purposefully, the Constitutional Convention enumerated the large number of Congress's powers in Article I, and gave most powers related to defense and foreign affairs to the people's branch.
In particular, the war power was given to Congress. The chief executive, whose powers were enumerated in the much more brief Article II, was given the commander-in-chief role, but this was intended narrowly, only as commander of U.S. troops on the battlefield.
Instead of declaring war, which has fallen out of fashion, the Congress, after 9/11, passed a resolution authorizing the president to go after al-Qaida overseas but deliberately omitted domestic activities from that authorization.
Democrats and Republicans alike declared that they were not endorsing a broad expansion of the president's authority as commander-in-chief.
An important example from the nation's infancy shows how narrowly the founders regarded the president's role as commander-in-chief. During the Quasi-War with France in the last years of the 1700s, Congress authorized President John Adams to seize armed ships sailing to French ports. Adams exceeded the congressional authorization by ordering the seizure of vessels sailing to or from French ports. The Supreme Court, in the case Little v. Barreme, ruled that Adams had exceeded the authority Congress had delegated to him. So much for Bush's supposed intrinsic authority to seize all oceangoing ships without congressional authorization.
In 1952, President Truman, the first imperial president, seized the steel mills under his alleged “inherent power” as commander in chief — supposedly to prevent paralysis of the national economy and using the rationale that soldiers in the Korean War needed weapons and ammunition.
By a wide margin, in the case Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the Supreme Court struck down Truman's executive order to seize the mills because it had no statutory or constitutional basis. Essentially, the court ruled that the president may be commander-in-chief of the armed forces but not the country.
Yoo's assertion that Congress has no right to pass laws that impinge on the president's claim to a broad interpretation of his role as commander-in-chief violates the core of the constitutional system of checks and balances, and for which the United States regularly criticizes despots in foreign countries.
Finally, the Fourth Amendment (requiring warrants for any search) and the Fifth Amendment (the right to due legal process) contain no exceptions for wartime. In fact, in a republic — where the rule of law should be king — crises and wartime are exactly when people's rights are most likely to be endangered and when safeguards are especially needed.
Even more tragic and dangerous than the quagmires of Iraq and Afghanistan have been President Bush's usurping of power from the other two branches of government and the creation of the “hyperimperial” presidency.

Variety reported yesterday that Warner Brothers is moving forward with the movie Rome Sweet Rome. This film's saga started on Reddit thread that began with a simple question: "Could I destroy the entire Roman Empire during the reign of Augustus if I traveled back in time with a modern U.S. Marine infantry battalion or MEU?"
One Reddit commenter, James Erwin, caught the attention of Madhouse Entertainment with a series of posts that became its own subreddit, telling the story of a unit that found itself back in time.
WB acquired the concept, and Erwin drafted a first script. According to the Variety report, Apollo 18 screenwriter Brian Miller has been hired to redraft the script, indicating that the studio will be moving forward with the movie.
I think it should prove to be a pretty fun movie, but it'll be interesting to see if movie producers start turning to reddit or other community sites to develop more projects. If they do, I really, really hope some HBO producers develop a TV concept set during the "Eternal War" - a reddit thread about a Civilization II game that lasted over 10 years.

A league that pioneered video review needs to uphold the same principals and do the right thing concerning FC Dallas and their illegal substitution over the weekend.
Prior to Saturday's scoreless draw between Dallas and Orlando City, Michael Barrios was officially placed in FCD's Starting XI, then summarily removed before kickoff, the team stating that the player had a foot injury and was unable to start. But then Barrios was inserted as a substitute late in the match, running afoul of the league's rules.
That he didn't matter or impact things much in a 0-0 match doesn't change what happened. It also shouldn't change what MLS must do, what truly is their only course of action.
According to MLS' rules, a player placed in the starting lineup who is then removed prior to kickoff is ineligible to play in that same match. This is to prevent teams from announcing their Starting XI then summarily making a slew of changes prior to kickoff. It is a rule that makes a lot of sense and is utilized the world over.
That Barrios were brought into the match is not only a terrible oversight of the four-man officiating crew in that match but is a decision that should be subject to forfeiture, as spelled out in the league rulebook.
Unknowingly or not, FCD fielded an ineligible player. Forfeiture is the only response.
If the league doesn't respond in this manner, then it is making a mockery of itself.
Last year, MLS spearheaded the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) in the United Soccer League, the second-division that is strongly affiliated with MLS. To that point, the limited use of VAR last year in the USL was implemented and run by MLS officials, who used it as a springboard for this year's launch of instant replay.
MLS went to great and noticeable lengths to implement VAR within the rules of the game, specifically to aid referees and help ensure the integrity of calls. While VAR could not be called on in this particular instance and it is well after this weekend's game anyway, it shouldn't stop MLS from doing the right thing.
FC Dallas should forfeit the match and lose the point it earned this weekend in the draw against Orlando City, who in turn should earn three points from the match.
If MLS went to such great extremes to implement and utilize VAR, a process this league started in conjunction with the USL and well ahead of the rest of the world, then a similar standard should be utilized here. It is about the game's integrity.
That is not to say that FC Dallas intentionally cheated or knowingly broke the rules, but the end result is the same thing. They must, if MLS is serious about the integrity of the game, do the only thing that can uphold the standards of the game.
Uphold this weekend's match and result and the whole purpose behind things that MLS does to better the game, such as VAR, will all be window dressing.
Summary: Here is the video and transcript of a revealing discussion at yesterday's Senate hearing about climate change. It shows in miniature how the debate about public policy to fight climate change has become gridlocked.
Hearing by the Senate Commerce Committee:
“Data or Dogma? Promoting Open Inquiry in the Debate
Over the Magnitude of the Human Impact on Earth's Climate”.
I recommend attention to the Q&A at the hearing between Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), Judith Curry (Prof Atmospheric Science, GA Inst Tech), and Mark Steyn (arts reviewer and conservative activist, introduced by Senator Cruz as “an international bestselling author, a Top Five jazz recording artist, and a leading Canadian human rights activist”).
You can see a video of the hearing and the witnesses' written testimony at the Senate website. Here is Prof Curry's verbal testimony. The witnesses mostly rehashed material long-familiar to anyone following both sides of the debate (but, as usual, astonishing to the majority following only one side).
I found the Q&A more interesting, as it nicely illustrates why this important issue has become gridlocked — and policy discussions like Kabuki (formal opera, predictable but entertaining).
The transcript appears below, followed by a few comments by me.
——————– Computer-generated transcript ——————–
Curry: Is it possible for me to respond? You basically ..
Markey: I did not ask for ask you a question
Steyn: Really, why can't why can't she respond. You basically impugned her integrity. I think she's entitled…
Markey: You are welcome to respond
Curry: I was basically called a denier, that I'm denying science. Did you read my written testimony? Are you aware that the IPCC in the consensus has no explanation for the increase of ice in the Antarctic? Are you aware that they have no explanation for the fact that the rate of sea-level rise from 1920 to 1950 was as large if not larger than it currently is Are you aware that temperatures have been warming for more than two hundred years and that in the 20th century 40% of the warming occurred before 1950 when carbon dioxide was not a factor in the warming? I could go on. Many of these issues are raised in my written testimony and our most of it is pulled from the IPCC itself. The IPCC has an explanation, so it says, for warming during the period 1975 to 2008. It doesn't have an explanation for the flat period since 2000. It doesn't have an explanation …
Markey: In my testimony corroborated by Dr. Titley this is the warmest year ever recorded. Last year is the warmest year ever recorded until this year. This is the warmest November ever recorded. October is the warmest October ever. You do not have an answer for that, doctor.
Curry: Yes, I do. …
Markey: You continue to ignore the chart which Doctor Titley has over his left shoulder. He has documented for this committee the warming trend which is inexorable inevitable in terms of its consequences unless we take action here. That's the science and you're having a hard time responding to.
Curry: The issue is what is causing the warming.
Markey: Is that natural variability for is that humans? Like Galileo, he said “no the science”. The science is clear. Are you depending upon perhaps this is God-made rather than dependent upon something that is man-made, which is anthropogenic and documented by 97%?
Steyn: Are you saying there's no natural variability, Senator? There were alligators at the North Pole. What was that site you and your SUV?
Markey: What I am saying is that this warming is something that while it may have variability, year-to-year in specific parts of the planet that the trend is straight up.
Steyn: Yeah, do you know what the Little Ice Age was, Senator?
Markey: Again it is climate change. We had a hundred and ten inches of snow in Boston last year with measurements of water 21 degrees warmer than normal off the coast of Massachusetts. This was an unusual event for us. The warming of the ocean intensifies the amount of precipitation when arctic air hits that water. Now if you want to deny that, if you watch these changes are taking place and that they're having a dramatic impact, you are in the right place.
Steyn: You know what the winters were like at Plymouth Rock, Senator.
Markey: Well here is the thing. We…
Steyn: You don't know. How long has your family been in Massachusetts?
Markey: We are new arrivals and I have to admit …
Steyn: You should have been there in 1750.
Market: The Irishman began arriving in 1750, so I apologize for being late to the country. And I'll have to chastise my grandparents for not leaving until the economic conditions in 1902 forced them here but that notwithstanding there is as much consensus that man is causing climate change as there is in Galileo's original theory. And climate changes causing …
Steyn: Senator, what percentage of climate change is man causing? What percentage of climate change is “anthropogenic”?
Markey: Well, according to the scientists who are in Paris right now — which would feel pretty much the entire base of the building in which we're in right now — and the number of deniers would still be the ones who …
Curry: Are you aware of a recent survey of the professional members of the American Meteorological Society? When asked the question how much use the recent changes natural versus human caused, 52% of the memberships that it was majority human caused.
Comments about this dialogue
That Steyn had the good lines shows that this isn't a debate so much as performance art. Scientists, like Judith Curry, spoke but few listened. Steyn's argumentative skills forced Senator Ed Markey to respond, but such exchanges have no more political impact than speeches at a high school debate — providing exchanges that Left and Right cheered and booed.
Markey appeared to have been briefed by activists and didn't listen to the testimony, so not only does not understand the other side of either the science or policy debates, he does not even know there is another side (he just sees error). He ignored material that contradicted his belief. He illustrated the “dogma” side of the “Data or Dogma” debate.
Markey sounded two major themes of climate activists. First, conflating the two centuries of warming (the warming before WWII predates substantial anthropogenic CO2) with the largely anthropogenic warming since 1950. For another example, see the Nov 2015 Science of Climate Change presentation by the Canadian government that goes all in on this error.
Second, like many warmists he asserts that “97% of climate scientists” believe whatever he wants them to believe. There are multiple surveys testing agreement with the headline finding of the IPCC's AR5 (it's not in the previous ARs) that “It is extremely likely (95 – 100% certain) that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2010.” For more about this see…
Update: about the analysis by Mark Steyn
Why did the Republicans invite art critic and political activist Mark Steyn to testify? He sent the debate wildly off course with his deliberately provocative far-right rhetoric (e.g., his islamophobic rant about the people of the Maldive Islands).
In a post at his website Mark Steyn made some perceptive observations about the hearings. He compares them unfavorably with the serious hearings he attended at Canada's Parliament, and makes several trenchant observations, such as these…
“Americans are the chumps of the planet for putting up with {Senators' behavior in hearings}. Since the 17th Amendment, senators have been citizen-legislators like any other, and so their contempt for the citizenry who have graciously consented, at their own time and expense to appear before them, demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the relationship. “… there was some extensive discussion of the satellite record: They have the scientist who created and developed the satellite temperature record sitting at one end of the table: John Christy. This is a remarkable scientific accomplishment. Yet they directed all their questions on the subject to the bloke down the other end – Rear Admiral Titley, who knows no more about the satellite record than I do. This is like inviting Sir Isaac Newton to a hearing on gravity and then only asking questions of Mr Timeserver sitting next to him. ” “… Unfortunately, the ‘decorum of the Senate' means that there are never any debates and only performance art …”
As for the suitability of him testifying about technical details of climate science, he says…
“Sad that there's no longer a place for a Renaissance man…”
Exactly. I don't want a Renaissance man doing neurosurgery on my son, or testifying about climate science. This is the 21st century, not the 19th (when amateur scientists make many important contributions to science).
Steyn says something I did not realize, but is true and important: “It's easy for Fabius Maximus to fight vainly the old ennui at this particular bit of performance art…” See my explanation in the comments.
One important correction: Stein says “To Fabius Maximus I'm an “art critic” (no art critic would regard me as such).” I had read only his excellent reviews of music and musicals (years ago). I have updated this post to reflect his other accomplishments.

As euro-region finance ministers turned the screw on Greece in Friday's talks, the group's usual enforcer, Wolfgang Schaeuble of Germany, was eclipsed by Spain's Luis de Guindos, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks.
De Guindos took the toughest line with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis as the bloc forced him to adhere to the terms of the country's existing bailout to retain access to official financing, the people said, asking not to be named because the conversations were private. When the group rejected Schaeuble's call for a Tuesday meeting to scrutinize Greece's plans to meet those conditions, De Guindos insisted, winning agreement for a teleconference, they said.
The Spanish government is particularly sensitive to the fortunes of the Syriza government in Greece because the party's Spanish ally, Podemos, has surged to the top of some recent polls. A victory for Varoufakis would have strengthened Podemos's argument that De Guindos's boss, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, was wrong to impose austerity on Spain.
The Spanish government “has always been constructive but it has to defend its interests,” Guindos said on Friday. “A climate is developing in which the new Greek government is adapting to the rules that affect us all.”
A spokeswoman for De Guindos said Spain is in favor of dialogue and flexibility within the existing rules and has shown its solidarity with Greece by contributing 26 billion euros ($30 billion) to its bailout at a time when its own financing conditions were not good.
Struggling to fend off a sovereign default, the Greek government acceded to European demands that it respect the conditions of its existing bailout package at Friday's meeting in Brussels. The Greek government must submit a list of economic measures it will undertake by Monday and finance chiefs will then decide whether the proposals go far enough.
Dijsselbloem Successor
De Guindos, at times raising his voice, railed against Varoufakis in Friday's meeting, telling him he has to win the trust of his euro-region counterparts and learn how politics is conducted at the European level, one of the people said.
De Guindos's ministry denies that there was shouting or that the economy minister raised his voice, according to a spokeswoman.
De Guindos has been in the running to replace Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands as head of the euro-region finance ministers' group when the Dutchman's term expires this year.
Spain's general election is due around the end of the year and Iglesias has pledged to restructure the country's 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) of public debt if he wins.

The Ocean Research Vessel, RRS Sir David Attenborough is to be re-named RRS Boaty McBoatface, a ship name which originally won the #NameOurShip online poll. After heated debate on both sides, Democracy and the will of the people has prevailed and the ship is now to be re-Christened the RRS Boaty McBoatface.
She was originally launched as RRS Sir David Attenborough, a name deemed a far more appropriate for a serious scientific study by the Natural Environment Research Council. Most experts agree however that changing the ship's name will lower the international standing of The Natural Environment Research Council, and actually make it likely to lose out on funding to other rival maritime research agencies. Despite these compelling arguments, it was seen as unfair to the voters not to make the change as they cast their votes in good faith.
Professor John Frost from Ocean Research gave a short statement on the ship's re-Christening: “We really wanted to keep Sir David Attenborough's name of the side of the vessel, he is such an inspiring and well-known figure as well as a champion for science and the environment. His name would have also given us great exposure for good within the media worldwide and scientific community as a whole, I'm sure Boaty McBoatface will also be quite good too.”
(Photo: herr_hartmann / Flickr)The last few years have seen a series of corporate catastrophes, for which the perpetrator companies have escaped any meaningful accountability. Big banks and giant Wall Street firms tricked and ripped off homeowners and investors, and crashed the national and global economy. BP's reckless operations poisoned the Gulf of Mexico in one of the worst oil disasters in history. Massey Energy's cost-cutting led to the Upper Big Branch coal mine collapse that killed 29 workers.
There have been virtually no criminal prosecutions for Wall Street wrongdoing related to the crash, and precious few civil actions. Criminal charges are likely to be filed against BP, but the company already has been granted new permits to drill for oil in the Gulf. Massey Energy—now owned by Alpha Natural Resources—was forced to pay $200 million in penalties but avoided any criminal prosecution.
This history notwithstanding, We the People, and our government representatives, do have the power to hold companies accountable for the wrongs they commit. The challenge is to mobilize sufficient political pressure to demand that available tools be used and new mechanisms of accountability be created.
One powerful way to hold companies accountable is through debarment—denying corporate wrongdoers the right to obtain government contracts. Almost every major company does significant business with the government, so debarment is a penalty with teeth. Similarly, federal, state, and local governments should deny other government benefits to corporate criminals and wrongdoers. Denying BP the right to drill in the Gulf is a penalty that would sting. Drug companies that can't sell to Medicare, Medicaid, and the Department of Veterans Affairs are deprived of more than a third of their market. The Federal Communications Commission has the authority to deny broadcast licenses to media corporations that do not exhibit “good character.” Federal and state governments do frequently debar companies, but typically only smaller firms that engage in massive fraud or operate as criminal enterprises.
A second tool to discipline corporate wrongdoers is charter revocation. Establishing a new corporation requires that a state government grant a charter to operate. (This is typically a perfunctory requirement, as evidenced by the state of Virginia's grant of a charter to Licensed to Kill, Inc., a company whose articles of incorporation state that it will engage in “manufactur[ing] and marketing of tobacco products in a way that each year kills over 400,000 Americans and 4.5 million other persons worldwide.”) State governments have the right to revoke charters from companies that do not serve the public interest. Free Speech for People has petitioned Delaware to revoke the charter of Massey Energy. Charter revocation effectively constitutes the death penalty for a corporation. Even occasional use against large corporations would be a major deterrent to corporate wrongdoing.
A third form of control on corporate wrongdoing is civil litigation. Lawsuits against corporate wrongdoers not only afford victims an opportunity to receive some compensation for the harms they have suffered, they work to strip corporations of ill-gotten gains. The civil justice system is a vital deterrent to corporate misconduct, because it means corporations will at least sometimes be forced to pay for the harms they cause. And lawsuits provide direct justice to victims of corporate wrongdoing, without the need to persuade government officials to act. In many ways, the U.S. civil justice system is the most important form of corporate accountability we have.
It's for exactly these reasons that corporations have worked for decades to undermine the functioning of the civil justice system, making it harder to file cases, interfering with the ability of victims to join together in class actions, making it harder for victims to obtain evidence, capping the damages that victims may recover, limiting punitive damages, and forcing victims out of the civil justice system (real courts) and into arbitration tribunals biased to favor giant corporations.
In recent years, organizations like EarthRights International and the Center for Constitutional Rights have innovated new ways to hold corporations accountable in U.S. courts for harms perpetrated overseas, relying especially on a law passed in 1789 called the Alien Tort Claims Act. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has responded with a campaign to foreclose such litigation.
In addition to using these and other corporate accountability tools already at our disposal, we need more. Among other things, we need to significantly strengthen the penalties for corporate endangerment of people's lives and well-being. In many instances, there is no criminal penalty applicable for recklessly putting consumers' or workers' lives at risk by knowingly selling dangerous pharmaceuticals or defective cars or by exposing workers to deadly toxic chemicals or other hazards. A law that would make it a felony to recklessly endanger consumers or workers, with stiff fines and sanctions for companies and jail time for responsible corporate management, would make our world safer and restrain corporate misconduct.
We live in a time of massive disparity between penalties for street criminals and corporate wrongdoers. Corporations, which claim all the rights of “persons,” are subjected to much weaker punishments than real people. It doesn't have to be.

BP seems to have bought many phrases related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the major search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing). What this means is that people who do an internet search to find information about the spill have a good chance to see BP's official site pop up at the top of their search results.This isn't so special. Lots of companies buy ads that show up when people search for them, and BP has admitted the practice:
"We have bought search terms on search engines like Google to make it easier for people to find out more about our efforts in the Gulf and make it easier for people to find key links to information on filing claims, reporting oil on the beach and signing up to volunteer," BP spokesman Toby Odone told ABC News.
But in the case of the biggest environmental disaster in US history, is it moral for BP to try to control the message this way? That's the question that our friends at Triple Pundit ask:
because BP is receiving "so much bad press" buying search terms so traffic is directed to their site is "a great PR strategy." He called the move "proactive." Scott Slatin, an analyst who runs the search engine marketing company Rivington said, "They paid to lock themselves into the first position against the oil spill terms, essentially putting a positive message on top of the news." [...] How ethical is it for BP to ensure its website is at the top of a search page?
If we look at BP's oil spill news site (I wasn't sure if I should link to it here, as I don't want to help them rank better in Google, but I figured you should see for yourself), all of the news seem to have a positive spin.
It's all about the number of barrels that were collected, and not those that are still leaking out and polluting the Gulf of Mexico. There are also a lot of items about what BP is paying for (loss of income claims, barrier island, etc), as if they were just philanthropists trying to help out the region, while in fact they are destroying the place and causing lasting damage.

Rainbow Rangers
The Story
Rainbow Rangers are a group of masked gay superheroes. They fight homophobia not with fists, but with the power of their love! A group of homophobes is trying to break into a local LGBT bar "The Rainbow". You must protect the bar at all cost!
The Gameplay
There are three pairs of Rainbow Rangers at your disposal. You select them by pressing keys 1, 2, 3. Pressing the key twice will focus the camera on the selected pair. Use the left mouse button to order the rangers to move. Drag with the right mouse button to move the camera. Press space for the rangers to kiss each other (this is represented with a rainbow icon). Kissing charges rangers' love energy meters, which allows them to run really fast. If any homophobe (the guys in black) passes rangers when they are kissing, he will start chasing them and will keep chasing until he losses the track of them. Use this to lure him away from the club. You should try to guide him into another pair of kissing rangers before your love energy is depleted - that way he will start chasing the new pair instead. If a homophobe catches a ranger he will knock him out for a few seconds. Thankfully, homophobes have limited energy and they lose it during the chase (but regenerate when not chasing). If a homophobe is drained of all of his energy, he will give up and go home. Let's see how many of them can you wear down...
ANN ARBOR - Jacq Kai Tchoryk and Sydney Tchoryk giggled Saturday as they chased each other around the sunny backyard of their family's home in a well-kept cul-de-sac northwest of Ann Arbor.
Their father, Pete Tchoryk, emerged from the house late that afternoon with an aluminum bat and bag of baseballs. Sydney, 10, turned cartwheels in the yard while Jacq Kai took his turn at bat. Their mother, Sarah Tchoryk, stood near the deck offering words of encouragement. If there's one thing she wants her children to know, it's that she supports them.
Baseball is one of the many sports Jacq Kai likes. The blue-eyed 7 year old is into Star Wars and he also likes building things, as evidenced by the "house" in the Tchoryk's family room he constructed for himself. The lopsided wooden box is roughly held together with duct tape and filled with "dinosaur skins," little pieces of foam Jacq Kai used for cushioning on the bottom of the box. His middle name, Kai, is written on the side of the house in duct tape. Jacq Kai worked hard for that name.
Jacq Kai is transgender, meaning he was born biologically female but identifies as a male. He knew as early as 2 years old that his sense of himself didn't match his physical body, and his family has supported him through the past five years of figuring out how to express his true identity.
It's going to be a lifelong process.
"It's a process you never rush into," said Pete, who is the CEO of Michigan Aerospace Corp. and Springmatter in Ann Arbor.
In light of the Michigan State Board of Education's proposed guidelines to help schools create safe and supportive environments for LGBTQ students, the Tchoryk family felt compelled to share their story. They've offered insight for the state board based on their experiences enrolling Jacq Kai at Dexter Community Schools, and they want to promote more understanding about what it means to be transgender.
As Pete put it, "We want to show people this can work."
"We have to tell this story. You look at what the stakes are if we don't," Pete said, referencing high rates of suicide attempts and self-harm among LGBTQ youth. "There's a lot of fear and a lot of misconceptions out there. That's the way we look at it now. Let everybody speak their minds and raise the fears. I want to hear it all now."
Pete and Sarah, who have been married for 12 years, consider themselves "reluctant advocates," carrying a sense of guilt that they were not better educated on transgender issues and the discrimination that community faces before it directly affected their family. As Sarah reflects on Jacq Kai's journey so far in expressing his true identity, she becomes emotional when thinking of how long it took her to accept the concept.
"As soon as he acquired language, he said 'I'm a boy,'" said Sarah, who is a fifth grade teacher. "Of course, we thought that he was confused because he was just learning to talk. We'd correct him and there'd be a major meltdown over it. So we stopped correcting him and we thought, 'oh, he'll figure it out.' We ended up figuring it out."
On July 23, 2008, Sarah and Pete welcomed their third daughter, Jacqueline, to the family. Their oldest daughter, Jessie, 25, is married with two daughters of her own. Sydney is in fourth grade.
As a toddler, Jacqueline started insisting she was a boy and rejecting any clothing, colors or accessories typically associated with girls. Sarah and Pete started calling their child Jackie -- a gender neutral name -- and purchasing girl's clothing in gender-neutral colors.
That still didn't satisfy Jacq Kai, who felt anxious and would often cry at his reflection in the mirror because he looked too much like a girl. Allowing Jacq Kai to get his hair cut like a boy when he was about 3-and-a-half years old was a milestone for the family and left him "jubilant," Sarah said.
"People have said 'We used to call that a tomboy in my day,'" she added. "But the intensity of it, it's not the same. He doesn't say 'I like boy things and I like boy clothes.' He says, 'I am a boy' and he's always seen himself as a boy. ... He's not happy with all the parts of his body. It's that intense."
Even with the haircut, Jacq Kai still dreaded going to daycare or preschool most days. It would take an hour-and-a-half to get him out the door in the morning, Pete said, because something was always off.
Finally in October of 2012, Pete asked whether using a boy's name would make a difference to Jacq, and he said it would. Pete and Sarah had already told school staff Jacq is transgender, and they decided to make the switch to referring to him as Jacq Kai and using male pronouns for him.
Having that affirmation of his identity made all the difference to then-4-year-old Jacq Kai.
"It's like a light switch," Pete said. " All the despair, all the anxiety, all these painful symptoms he was exhibiting and the problems I had getting him out the door disappeared."
Last September, the Tchoryks legally changed Jacq's name to Jacq Kai Tchoryk, which was the cause for the family to celebrate. Another milestone came last December when Cornerstone Elementary School Principal Craig McCalla spoke to Jacq Kai's class about what it means to be transgender.
It's all part of the process of normalizing their family's experiences and educating people on transgender issues.
Since speaking out about their transgender son, Pete and Sarah received what they considered a disheartening amount of negative feedback, though they noticed online comments tend to be more positive when they talk about their personal experiences rather than the issue of transgender rights as an abstract concept.
Some of the main misconceptions they've run into are people who think gender identity and sexual orientation are the same, those who believe being transgender is a choice and the widespread bathroom debate, which argues that allowing transgender people to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their biological gender will lead to an increase in assaults taking place in bathrooms.
Banning transgender students' bathroom choices would violate federal law, experts say One state lawmaker says he plans on introducing legislation requiring transgender students to obtain written parental consent to use a bathroom or locker room that does not match their sex at birth
Pete's analytical side shows as he recounts what he's learned in all of his research on the topic and from speaking to numerous doctors and psychologists in reference to Jacq Kai.
"I try to put all these facts on paper. The fear has to be addressed head on," he said. "You can see everywhere with these bathroom bills the kind of panic that this starts. The fact of the matter is transgender people have been using the bathrooms they identify with for decades. ... There are healthy fears in this world and there are unhealthy fears. That is an unhealthy fear. That is not based on reality."
The federal Title IX civil rights law protects students from sex discrimination in federally-funded schools, and legal experts say that covers students' right to choose which bathroom they use. Jacq Kai uses the boy's bathroom at school without issue.
Pete also pointed to research that shows making schools more inclusive and safer for LGBTQ students benefits all students. The Torchyk family is now committed to doing whatever they can to ensure all children have a positive, welcoming school experience.
"This is not something that's going to help one subset of kids and all of a sudden put other kids in danger. ... I'm kind of ashamed that it took for us to have a transgender kid to open our eyes," Pete said. "We're just marching through life as the privileged majority. ... That's another reason why we have to tell our story. It changed our world completely - for the better. It made us better human beings."

Acupuncture may help babies who cry too much, according to a new study published in the journal Acupuncture in Medicine. Infants with colic—crying for more than three hours a day, for at least three days a week—had fewer symptoms after getting the traditional Chinese needling technique compared to the standard treatment.
Most human acupuncture research has been in adults, and studies have linked the practice with reduced pain, improved gastrointestinal function and increased calm. To find out if it might help with excessive crying in infants, researchers recruited 147 healthy babies between two and eight weeks old who had all been diagnosed with colic.
The babies and their families were assigned to one of three groups, and they visited a child health center twice weekly for two weeks. Parents in all three groups spoke with a nurse about their child's symptoms, and two of the groups also received acupuncture.

Some patients were given standard minimal acupuncture at LI4, a spot on the hand between index finger and thumb, for 2 to 5 seconds. The second group received acupuncture at up to five locations on the hands and legs, for up to 30 seconds with mild stimulation.
All of the parents kept diaries of how much time the babies spent crying at home. After two weeks, all three groups were crying less—an expected result, say the researchers, since colic tends to eventually clear up by itself.
But the reduction in crying was greater in both acupuncture groups than in the standard-treatment group, suggesting a faster recovery. During the second week of the experiment, only 16 babies in the standard acupuncture group and 21 in the tailored group still met the criteria for colic, compared to 31 babies in the standard-treatment group.
The results also suggest that acupuncture could have a lasting impact. Six days after the final clinic visit, the differences between the acupuncture and non-acupuncture groups remained. Overall, there were no meaningful differences between results in the two acupuncture groups.
The babies tolerated the acupuncture well. Sleeping babies rarely woke during treatment, and 200 of the 388 treatments given involved no crying at all. Only 31 sessions involved crying for longer than a minute, and only 15 resulted in any bleeding. (In each of those cases, only a single drop of blood was noted.) Three families dropped out of the trial before it ended.
The treatments were performed by licensed acupuncturists with an average of 20 years experience. They had also attended an education day specifically about acupuncture for colic.
Fussing and crying are normal for babies, the authors point out, and the goal of treatment should be a reduction to normal crying levels, not complete silence. Tired and worried parents often overestimate normal crying, says lead author Kajsa Landgren, a nurse and lecturer at Lund University in Sweden, so those considering further treatment should first keep a diary of crying times to determine if it really is excessive.
Landgren also recommends eliminating cow's milk from a baby's diet before seeking acupuncture or other treatment. (This means choosing formula without cow's milk protein, or, if a mother is breastfeeding, avoiding cow's milk herself.) Doing so can help treat excessive crying; in a weeklong registration period for the study, this helped treat excessive crying in 269 of the 426 babies initially identified for the research.
But for the 10% to 20% of families who struggle with infantile colic even after these steps are taken, “minimal acupuncture seems to be a safe and effective treatment,” Lundgren says.
Dr. Erica Sibinga, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Integrative Medicine and associate professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, says the study was rigorously designed and well conducted, and that it touches on an important and distressing issue for infants and their parents. “I believe this treatment sounds extremely promising for a difficult clinical problem,” she says, “and given the exemplary safety profile of the acupuncture treatments, I will be happy to recommend to patients.”
Sticking babies with sharp objects may sound unpleasant, but consider this, Dr. Sibinga says: The needles used in acupuncture have a much smaller gauge than those used to draw blood or give immunizations, so they're less likely to cause discomfort or damage. Landgren adds that acupuncture in children generally uses fewer needles and milder, shorter periods of stimulation, compared to acupuncture in adults.
In fact, Landgren says that acupuncture is performed routinely in pediatric pain clinics in the United States, and has also been used to treat bed wetting, ADHD, nausea and constipation. In some cases, it allows less medication to be given: an important benefit for young children who are more sensitive to the effects of drugs.
Although research on infants is sparse, some earlier studies have shown promise for colic and pain. “I think that acupuncture is especially interested in symptoms where there's no other safe method or medication that relieves the symptoms, like in colic,” says Landgren. “And many desperate parents are willing to try complementary medicine.”
Parents who are interested in this treatment—and doctors who want to refer patients—should look for trained, licensed and experienced Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners who are interested in working with infants and their families, says Dr. Sibinga, and who can provide treatments comparable to those in the study.

HARRISON, N.J.—Chris Wondolowski likely will get another raise in 2013, which seems only fair following a landslide MLS MVP campaign. But he might be hard pressed to match last year's haul of 27 goals.
No MLS player ever has scored more in a single season. In addition to that historic burden, Wondolowski says his days as a full-time frontrunner could be ending.
“The record I want to try and top is more wins than last year,” he said Monday during a league media event. “Especially with having Lenny and Gordo, especially if they're healthy, I might be playing outside mid. I might be playing midfield a bit. It's good to have those guys on the field, and I'm willing to play wherever to have the best 11 out there.”
Lenny (Steven Lenhart) and Gordo (Alan Gordon) combined to score 23 regular-season goals in 2012 and, along with Wondolowski, powered the never-say-die Earthquakes to the Supporters Shield title. The club's attack was the most prolific MLS had seen in 14 years, but the forward trio hardly ever started the same game together.
That might change in 2013. Wondolowski has played in midfield before and offers a bit of versatility that would complement Lenhart and Gordon up front. Wondolowski, who just turned 30, is more comfortable with the ball at his feet and with quick combination play and can be effective making timely runs from withdrawn positions.
Lenhart and Gordon are grinders. Lenhart is the target man, excellent in the air and good at clearing out space in the penalty area. Gordon is a direct, no-nonsense hybrid with decent touch who is coming into his own at 31.
San Jose coach Frank Yallop suggested recently that Wondolowski is willing to make on-field sacrifices.
“He's such a team guy,” Yallop said after Wondolowski was presented with his MVP award. “Doesn't always think about himself, although he looks like he does when he scores the goals and finishes things off. He just wants to win. That's important to know.
“He's unselfish. He'll do anything for his teammates, all the things you want in a player.”
What Wondolowski isn't willing to give up, however, is money. A late bloomer who scored only seven goals across his first five MLS seasons, he made only $48,000 per year as recently as 2010. Then he stunned American soccer with 19 regular-season and playoff goals.
His salary more than tripled to $175,000 in 2011, when he found the net 16 more times. Last year, he made $300,000. But after another historic season, Wondolowski reportedly wants to be a Designated Player, earning a seven-figure income. MLS had only 12 millionaires on the books last year.
He said Monday that he's confident he'll strike a new deal with the Earthquakes soon.
“We are in the process of working something out,” he said. “It hasn't quite happened but it should be done, if everything goes smoothly, in the next week or two. As long as everything goes to plan, before the season.”
San Jose kicks off its 2013 campaign on March 3 vs. Real Salt Lake.
Wondolowski wasn't part of the U.S. national team that lost to Honduras in last week's World Cup qualifier, but he did attend coach Jurgen Klinsmann's January camp and played the first half of last month's 0-0 exhibition draw with Canada. Wondolowski didn't perform badly and didn't get much help from a relatively listless American midfield, but he also failed to find the net for the ninth time in nine international appearances. He was the only U.S. player to put a shot in target that night in Houston.
“It's frustrating. You want to get out there and score goals, especially being a forward,” Wondolowski said. “It doesn't always work out like that. You just have to take it for what it is and try to work hard any way you can.”
He said Klinsmann's message has been consistent: “Just keep searching to get better. Don't be content and don't get complacent.”
That doesn't necessarily mean a move abroad is in the cards. At his age and with deep roots in his native Northern California, Wondolowski might have hit the big time too late to secure a move abroad.
“I've talked to (Klinsmann) about it,” he said. “Just with my current contract situation, I'll still be two years under contract (in San Jose) and he was very wise—if the team wants you, they'd pay the transfer fee.”
Klinsmann is “very positive about how MLS has really grown as a league,” Wondolowski said, and simply demands that players continue to work to improve. He can do that at home in San Jose, where an expanded role for a championship-hungry team and the pressure that comes along with a big salary would make the spotlight on Wondolowski even brighter this year.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Israel on Tuesday complained to the United Nations about a Palestinian initiative to fly their flag alongside full member states' at the world body's headquarters, calling it “another cynical misuse of the U.N. by the Palestinian Authority.”

Currently, only member states' flags fly at U.N. headquarters. While the 193-nation assembly overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine in 2012, a Palestinian attempt to secure full U.N. membership failed. Palestine is considered a non-member state.
But the flags of the two non-member states - Palestine and the Vatican - could soon be flying at the United Nations.
The General Assembly is expected to vote on Sept. 10 on a Palestinian resolution that says the flags of non-member observer states “shall be raised at the United Nations Headquarters and Offices following the flags of the member states of the United Nations.”
Israel's U.N. Ambassador Ron Prosor wrote a letter of complaint about the Palestinian initiative to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and this year's president of the 193-nation General Assembly, Sam Kutesa of Uganda.
“For 70 years the United Nations has raised only flags of full member states,” Prosor said, adding that the Palestinians never held a single round of consultations on their resolution. He called it “another cynical misuse of the U.N. by the Palestinian Authority.”
“Once again the Palestinians prefer to score easy and meaningless points at the U.N., simply because they can,” he said. “It's time to unequivocally tell them: this is not the path to statehood, this is not the way for peace.”
He also accused the Palestinians, who he said appear to already have enough votes for their resolution to pass, of misleading U.N. member states by pretending that it was a joint initiative with the Vatican.
Last week, the Holy See's mission issued a diplomatic note saying it would not co-sponsor the resolution and demanding that all references to it be cut from the draft.
Several days later, it issued a new news release reiterating that it did not object to the Palestinian draft resolution on flying non-member states' flags but without any reference to its earlier demand that it not be mentioned in the resolution. But it made clear it was satisfied with the status quo.
Prosor said the Vatican issued the second statement under pressure from the Palestinian and Arab delegations.
Neither the Vatican's nor the Palestinians' U.N. missions had any immediate response to queries about Prosor's letter.
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Jacoby Ellsbury is set to rejoin the Red Sox for Friday night's game against the Rays after missing three months with a shoulder injury.
Will Middlebrooks went through a full workout on Thursday night and said he is ready to play, too. He was out for seven games with a left hamstring strain.
Carl Crawford was 2 for 3 for Triple A Pawtucket Thursday night and the tentative plan is for him to come off the disabled list on Monday. That would be his first game of the season.
Dustin Pedroia, on the DL with a thumb injury, also got some good news on Thursday and is close to returning.
The 43-43 Red Sox will soon have the kind of roster they envisioned at the start of spring training but have yet to see. For general manager Ben Cherington, there are no more excuses.
“We've been saying for a while that we feel like we have a good team here. But at some point you've got to show it on the field and the reality is we're at .500 at the All-Star break,” Cherington said Thursday night after the team worked out at Tropicana Field.
“We have good players who have been playing and we have good players on the way back. But at some point you have to stop talking about the cavalry coming back and just start winning games. We're going to do that.”
With the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline approaching, Cherington said the Red Sox have no plans to break up their roster.
“I don't envision a scenario where we're sellers in the traditional sense of the word,” he said. “We have some potential surplus in areas that we've been talking to teams about; if there's a way to help us now and in the future. Every year in Boston is too important. We're focused on winning this year and still believe we can.”
But Cherington also made it clear he's not eager to dip into a farm system to deal for short-term rental players.
“You never say never to anything. You've got to keep an open mind,” he said. “But we feel really good about our farm system. It's come a long way even in the last 12 months. We feel like that next generation of Red Sox players is coming.”
How the team plays over the next two weeks will determine whether Cherington leans one way or the other.
For a period of six months in 2010, I lived in East Harlem and worked in Prospect Heights. This meant riding the subway for about an hour every morning, and on those trips when I managed to stay awake, one of the most interesting aspects of the ride was watching the changing demographics of my fellow passengers as we moved from Harlem to the Upper West Side, then to Times Square and Penn Station, down to Tribeca and Wall Street, and from there into Brooklyn, passing through Brooklyn Heights, Downtown Brooklyn, and on to Prospect Heights. The traditional spin on New York has it that it's not a segregated city, or at least it's less segregated than other major American ones, like Boston and Washington, DC, because our public transportation jumbles us all together. But as anyone who's ridden a line a long way knows, that's not the full story.
Now The New Yorker has taken the increasing economic segregation of our city and visualized it. The magazine matched up median household income information from the 2011 US Census with nearby subway stations, creating maps of each line that spike and dip as the train moves from one stop, and one borough, to the next.
At first glance, the maps are both surprising and not surprising at all. Everyone knows Manhattan is the city's richest borough, and that's confirmed by the across-the-board peaks in the borough. But seeing just how big the jumps sometimes are — from a median income of $36,691 at Nostrand Ave. to $205,192 at Chambers St. on the A — is a bit shocking, not to mention depressing. The maps also make clear how concentrated and exceptional that wealth is: the 2, for instance, starts out at Flatbush Ave.–Brooklyn College, where median income is $37,073, and ends at Wakefield–241st St., $38,261, with only a handful of major peaks in between. The only line that basically tops out at $100,000 is the also only one that doesn't go into Manhattan, the G.
There are some puzzling points: here in the office, for instance, we couldn't figure out how the Lorimer stop on the L had a higher income than the Bedford stop, which seemed on par with the median income at the Morgan Ave stop. But that may have to do with how the census data is mapped onto the subway stops locations, and it's also good to keep in mind that these numbers reflect median, not average, income. Also, since we're only following the subway, Staten Island is missing entirely; finding some way to incorporate the fifth borough would be illuminating.
Ultimately, these maps aren't telling us much that's new. But as with all data visualization, they're crunching the numbers and making them easier to understand. Somehow visuals have a way of taking something we already know and may be inured to, and making it something we care more about.
Founder of Academy of St Martin in the Fields was still conducting into his 90s and his Amadeus soundtrack sold 6.5m copies
Sir Neville Marriner, one of the world's greatest conductors, has died.
The founder of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, who conducted many of the world's leading orchestras, died in his sleep on Sunday, aged 92, the academy said.
Marriner was still conducting into his 90s, conducting a concert to celebrate entering his 10th decade two years ago, which included a rendition of Happy Birthday. His 90th birthday was also marked by Classic FM dedicating an entire day of programming to his performances.
Neville Marriner: 'My wife has told me to keep June free' Read more
His soundtrack to the 1984 Oscar-winning film Amadeus is one of the most popular classical music recordings of all time. It topped the US album chart and has sold over 6.5m copies. The publicity blurb for the film said: “Only two people were qualified to conduct the score.” Below those words were two pictures: one of Mozart in powdered wig, the other of Marriner in white dickie bow. “One was unavailable,” added the blurb.
Academy chairman, Paul Aylieff, said: “We are greatly saddened by today's news. Sir Neville's artistic and recording legacy, not only with the academy but with orchestras and audiences worldwide is immense. He will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him, and the academy will ensure it continues to be an excellent and fitting testament to Sir Neville.”
Born in Lincoln, Marriner began as a violinist. He studied at the Royal College of Music with WH Reed, biographer and friend of Elgar, and the Paris Conservatoire. He began his career playing in a string quartet and trio, then in the London Symphony Orchestra. He formed the Academy with the aim of forming a top-class chamber ensemble from London's finest players. Ironically, it was conceived as a conductor-free refuge for string-players but Marriner became, as he put it, “a turncoat” – a conductor who on stage, as often as not, held a violin in one hand and a baton in the other.

Marriner began his conducting career in 1969, after studying in the US, where he founded the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, while at the same time developing and extending the size and repertoire of the academy.
In 1979 he became music director and principal conductor of both the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra and the Südwest Deutsche Radio Orchestra in Stuttgart, positions he held until the late 1980s.
He subsequently continued to work with orchestras around the globe. Marriner was music director of the academy from its formation in 1958 to 2011 when he became life president.
From its humble beginnings in Marriner's front room as a group of friends getting together to rehearse, the academy, which gave its first performance in its namesake church in 1959, now enjoys one of the largest discographies – over 500 albums – of any chamber orchestra worldwide, and its partnership with its founder is the most recorded of any orchestra and conductor.
In one of the more exciting developments in the Bitcoin space so far this year, noted Bitcoin angel investor and entrepreneur Roger Ver has given his blessing to a Bitcoin 2.0 application, and it's one that some may have overlooked in the past. Truthcoin, a Bitcoin sidechain designed by Yale Department of Economics Researcher Paul Sztorc, is described as a “peer-to-peer oracle system and prediction marketplace.”
The platform is a decentralized method of bringing external data, such as the price of gold or the weather in a particular city, to the blockchain, which can then be used as the basis for complex smart contracts
.Roger Ver's backing of Truthcoin
Ver is excited about what may become possible through the use of a working implementation of Truthcoin, and shared the following statement via email: “I really do think that decentralized prediction markets may be the most important invention since Bitcoin, and will certainly change the way our world works.”
The perpetual Bitcoin angel investor has been silently funding a C++ programmer who is building a working Truthcoin implementation using a fork of the original Bitcoin codebase. Some of this early code is now available on GitHub. Ver also shared some complimentary remarks in regard to Truthcoin Creator Paul Sztorc's understanding of the technical challenges ahead.
“Compared to Paul, I don't think there are many people on the planet" who could have created something like Truthcoin, Ver said. "Before meeting him, I already understood some of the benefits and exciting things that distributed prediction markets will bring to the world, so upon meeting Paul, he seemed like the right person to help make it a reality, so I agreed to get involved.”
No empty promises
Sztorc has made it a point to avoid any sort of Truthcoin crowdsale without an actual product to back the offering, and he has noted his discontent with other Bitcoin 2.0 crowdsales in the past. The Truthcoin creator plans to insist that a crowdsale does not take place until the software has been built, tested and operational for “at least three months” without any need for a hard fork.
It should be noted that anyone who wishes to place a bet on the Truthcoin network will be able to do so with their bitcoin-denominated sidechain tokens. Any crowdsale for this project would likely involve the sale of votecoins, which are used by individuals who wish to vote on the outcomes of real life events. Holders of votecoins who honestly report the outcome of an event are then rewarded with fees generated from the participants in a particular prediction market.
In addition to a possible crowdsale, the monetization model for this project also includes the expected growth in the bitcoin price for holders of the digital money.
When will Truthcoin be available?
In an email to Bitcoin Magazine, Sztorc noted that Truthcoin is currently a testnet “altcoin” with only two people running nodes. “In fact, it really isn't much of anything yet," he added.
The votecoin in this current setup are not intended to have any value and should be viewed in a manner similar to testnet bitcoin. Sztorc also wrote about how Truthcoin might earliest become a Bitcoin sidechain.
“What would (obviously) be really cool is if, at some point, someone from Blockstream would rip it open and graft in something to make this version a ‘testnet sidechain' so that testnet coins could hop over,” he said.
The Truthcoin team doesn't have the time to deal with sidechain compatibility right now, and Sztorc even mentioned it “might interfere with early testing.”Sztorc also did not want to reveal any kind of release date as he “[doesn't] endorse that type of forecasting.” In the past, Sztorc has poked fun at Ethereum's Frontier release due to prediction markets at Fairlay.com that seem to indicate that the release won't happen until after August 1. This is far off from the project's original launch date.
For now, anyone interested in the project can visit the Truthcoin forums, read the latest version (1.4) of the Truthcoin whitepaper, or follow Sztorc's blog.
For nearly 20 years, Professor Eric Fortune has studied glass knifefish, a species of three-inch long electric fish that lives in the Amazon Basin. In his laboratory he tries to understand how their tiny brains control complex electrical behaviors. But he could not help but be intrigued by the special "ribbon fin" that knifefish use to swim back and forth. The fin oscillates at both ends, allowing the fish to move forward or backward. Biologists have long wondered why an animal would produce seemingly wasteful forces that directly oppose each other while not aiding its movement.
But in the Nov. 4-8 online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Fortune and a multi-disciplinary team of researchers report that these opposing forces are anything but wasteful. Rather, they allow animals to increase both stability and maneuverability, a feat that is often described as impossible in engineering textbooks.
"I read a Navy flight training manual that had a full page dedicated to the inherent tradeoff between stability and maneuverability, says Fortune, an associate professor of biology at NJIT. "Apparently the knifefish didn't read that manual, since the opposing forces surprisingly make the fish simultaneously more stable and more maneuverable."
When an animal or vehicle is stable, it resists changes in direction. On the other hand, if it is maneuverable, it has the ability to quickly change course. Generally, engineers assume that a system can rely on one property or the other--but not both. Yet some animals prove an exception to the rule.
"Animals are a lot more clever with their mechanics than we often realize," said Noah Cowan, a professor of mechanical engineering at The Johns Hopkins University and the senior author of the multi-disciplinary research team. "By using just a little extra energy to control the opposing forces, animals seem to increase both stability and maneuverability when they swim, run or fly."
And Fortune suspects that the study will inspire young engineers to approach mechanical design in novel ways. "Despite the fact that the knifefish break a traditional rule of engineering," says Fortune, "they nevertheless achieve better locomotor performance than current robotic systems."
To conduct its study, the team used a combination of careful observations of the fish, mathematical modeling and an analysis of a swimming robot. Working in his NJIT lab with students and in collaboration with his colleagues at Johns Hopkins, Fortune used slow-motion video to film the fish to study its fin movements: What the videos revealed was startlingly counterintuitive.
"It is immediately obvious in the slow-motion videos is that the fish constantly move their fins to produce opposing forces," says Fortune. "One region of their fin pushes water forward, while the other region pushes the water backward. This arrangement is rather counter-intuitive, like two propellers fighting against each other."
A mathematical model designed by Shahin Sefati, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins and a lead author of the research project, showed that this odd arrangement generates stabilizing forces. But the model also suggested that the opposing forces simultaneously improved the ability of the animal to change its velocity, thereby making the animal more maneuverable. The team then tested this model using a robot in the laboratory of Malcolm MacIver at Northwestern University; the robot mimicked the fish's fin movements.
One exciting implication of study is its possible application to robotics systems, including the design of sophisticated robots and aircraft. Designers and engineers might make simple changes to propulsion systems, such as tilting engines or motors so that some of the thrusts oppose each other. Such an arrangement might waste some energy, but this cost may be more than offset by making a robot or aircraft simpler to operate and thus safer.
Fortune joined the NJIT faculty last year as part of a university initiative to increase interdisciplinary research.
"This study is a good example of how engineers can look to nature with the tools of biology to inspire new approaches to solving fundamental design challenges in engineering," says Fortune. "In the other direction, biologists benefit from the application of the analytic tools and quantitative approaches that are routine in engineering. NJIT, with its focus on interdisciplinary research, is just the ecosystem we need to translate these ideas into new technologies."

After a rally from 0.003 $ at the start of Bitcoin trading to 31.89 $ in June 2011, Bitcoin prices declined for 4.5 months to just under 2 $ in November 2011.
Many people in the media called bitcoin death at that moment.
But… since the November bottom, the Bitcoin exchange rate has advanced versus the US dollar by more than 300%, from 2 $ to 6-7 $ per Bitcoin.
The big news now is that the new Bitcoin rally will likely be even stronger than the first rally from April 2010 to June 2011.
This first rally led to a 10,630-fold increase from 0.003 $ to 31.89 $. In the hottest phase from March to June 2011, investors and traders entered a race to put funds into exchanges and buy Bitcoins.
There are three main reasons why the second Bitcoin race will likely be faster than the first:
Fundamentals are stronger than before. There are many more Bitcoin businesses than in spring 2011. BitcoinDeals.com, for example, is a shopping portal offering more than 370,000 products from Armani and Gucci fragrances to electronics from HP and Cisco . All can be purchased with Bitcoins, physical Bitcoins from Casascius.com, and many more.
There was a successful European Bitcoin Conference in November 2011, with high profile attendees and speakers including Rick Falkvinge and Max Keiser, the latter announcing that he wants 1,000,000 people to use Bitcoins.
There is again positive news flow in the media, talking about “Bitcoin's comeback”. Technicals are bullish. Bitcoin analysts see evidence that the new, second rally leg will be a major wave up. According to Elliott Wave theory, this rally is typically stronger than the first wave, and it should lead to new all-time highs above 31.89 $, the June 2011 high. Psychology has turned up After multiple issues in spring and summer 2011, including hacks of the biggest exchanges, security flaws, fraud, etc. Security has improved and this led to more trust in Bitcoins than ever before.
Investor optimism has also improved, with more people being bullish than bearish on Bitcoins (current bullish consensus is at 78.9% per our online poll here).
Trading Bitcoins
There are many exchanges offering Bitcoin trading.
Once the account is funded with fiat money, basically, Bitcoins can be traded in the same way as stocks, Forex, Gold, Silver, or other commodities: Just place an order, set a limit and then get the trade executed – it's a matter of seconds.
However, Bitcoins cannot (yet) be traded on regulated exchanges via online brokers like eTrade, ameritrade, etc. If people do not have funds in Bitcoin exchanges, it can take up to a couple of days to have funds transferred to the Bitcoin currency exchanges. If Bitcoin prices are rising during that deposit delay, people will miss this part of the rally. And this is exactly why there has been the “Race” for bitcoins in spring 2011. People were racing to find the fastest way to get funds into Bitcoin exchanges.
One of the biggest questions in the Bitcoin forum at the time was “how can I get my funds fastest into MtGox” (the biggest Bitcoin exchange). Here are just two revelatory comments from the forum:
“It amuses me that some people have been wanting to invest in Bitcoins for weeks, but haven't been willing to pay even 1% to get money into the most liquid exchange. Meanwhile the price has soared. What's 1% compared to 1460% gain in just about 5 weeks?” — May 14 “buyers are probably chomping at the bit waiting for the influx of dwolla/gox money”. — May 18
The Gold Race in the Last Decade
When we think about store of wealth, Bitcoins are in many ways similar to Gold. It is not far-fetched to call Bitcoins “Gold 2.0” or virtual Gold.
Since the start of a big rally in 2003, Gold physical holdings of Exchange Traded Funds have increased multiple times. At the same time, Gold prices increased from 200 $ to 1900 $ at the high, an almost perfect correlation to the fund inflows.
(Charts from http://www.kitco.com/charts/CPM_charts.html )
Which asset was stronger in 2011, Bitcoins or Gold? This is answered by the Bitcoin / Gold ratio. As evident in below chart, Bitcoins have outperformed gold and probably most if not all other financial assets since start of Bitcoin trading in April 2010.
While the gold rally has finally faded over the past months (Gold is down from the $1900 to $1600's), Bitcoins may be the taking the lead.
Run to Bitcoin
Often, a great way to look into the future is to look for repeating patterns in the past. When we look at volume price trend, we see that massive Bitcoin rallies erupted in fall 2010 (a 17-fold increase) and spring 2011 (a 65-fold increase), as evident in the below Bitcoin chart. Together with these Bitcoin price increases, the price volume trend indicated higher demand for Bitcoins than supply, which was largely driven by fund inflows into the exchanges.
In our opinion, most indications are pointing to a major rally to new all-time highs in Bitcoin prices.
And the most likely outcome is that a new Bitcoin race is underway. Bitcoin prices have already advanced by more 300% since the November low and at 6-7 $, are still way below the 31.89 $ high from June 2011. If the current race is just re-testing this high, there is another 4 to 5-fold increase possible.
And, putting this into the broader context of the likely Euro break down and more widespread turmoil in financial markets in 2012, Bitcoins may well be the best or at least one of the best financial assets – possibly a better store of value than even Gold.

Samsung is yet to launch the Galaxy S8 and based on the latest report, the launch date has been postponed to April 28, which is a week later than the earlier scheduled date. That means we still have to wait 7 weeks before the phone is released. That's really long. But if you are in China, you might not have to wait that long, depending on how you look at it.
A Weibo user @kumamoto posted pictures of a Galaxy Note 8 clone he got his hands on in one of China's most popular electronics market, the Huaqiang North Market.
The clone shares quite a number of similarities with the original based on leaked images but there are still some major differences. First is the position of the fingerprint scanner and the camera's LED flash. On the original Galaxy S8, the LED flash is on the left and the fingerprint scanner is positioned on the right but the positions are switched on the clone. Another difference is in the design of the speaker grille, and the use of a microUSB port instead of USB Type-C.

The biggest difference can be seen when the phone is turned on . While the manufacturer has done a good job mimicking the Touchwiz look, you can see that the display sports large black bars at the top and bottom of the screen unlike the original which sports a display that extends to both edges of the screen.
Clones of Samsung devices are not unusual in China, so this doesn't come as much of surprise.

Miami University fired football coach Al Golden on Sunday, one day after the team suffered a record-setting 58-0 loss to Clemson and also one day after athletics director Blake James said he wouldn't make a change immediately.
As news of the firing spread, folks put together lists of potential coaches the Hurricanes might hire taking over for the 2016 season.
Las Vegas sports book Bovada has placed odds on who will be the Hurricanes' coach next season, and the No. 1 name on the list is familiar to Miami fans. They have former Miami coach Butch Davis listed first at 7/4 odds.
Personally, I think Davis is a longshot to get the job - but I'm not building giant hotel/casinos with my winnings.
Here is the list of coaches released by Bovada.
Butch Davis - 7/4
Mario Cristobal - 7/2
Rob Chudzinski - 5/1
Justin Fuente - 11/2
Greg Schiano - 8/1
Doc Holliday - 8/1
Frank Wilson - 9/1
Tom Herman - 9/1
Tommy Tuberville - 10/1
A recent report by CoinDesk sheds light on rising interest in blockchain applications in the capital markets spurred by private conferences and high-profile investments from leading Wall Street firms in 2015.
Drawing attention to the newest entrant, Symbiont, the report said that it launched its first blockchain-based private security earlier this month, converting its founders' shares, convertible preferred shares and convertible note terms to function on the blockchain.
Speaking to CoinDesk, Symbiont CEO Mark Smith opened up on the firm and its market strategy, suggesting that the private equities market will be its main focus. The FX trading veteran and founder of early E*Trade alternative MatchBookFX called a robust private securities market "the only future" given that many startups are avoiding public offerings.
"You look at companies like Uber in Series K or Series N rounds, the allure of going public isn't what it used to be", he said.
Putting shares in private companies on the blockchain, according to Smith, provides a perfect proof of concept for the technology's capital markets applications.
"What can be done then is transfers to other securities. Because we did straight equity and debt, we demonstrated you can do a bond on the bitcoin blockchain and then you can do it on a permissioned ledger system," Smith continued.
Beyond private equities, Smith sees opportunities in the corporate bond market and the syndicated loans market.
When asked about the firm's regulatory strategy, Smith was quick to state that he believes Symbiont to be a "pure technology company", one that will seek to work with existing financial solutions to develop blockchain solutions.
"We don't want to disintermediate financial institutions, but allow them to deliver products and services better. We want to be trusted and transparent to enter into new markets to shift models away from models where there is high risk," Smith continued.
Symbiont has not applied for a BitLicense in New York, but suggested it is in talks with FINRA and the SEC to ensure its compliance, the report added.
"We don't touch fiat or crypto, we don't money transfer," Smith said. "Our customer is responsible for KYC and AML that they sponsor onto our permissioned network. We're never a counterparty for a trade, we never custody a currency fiat or crypto."
As for the competition, Smith indicated that he sees this as a sign the firms involved are innovating in the right direction and added, "I'd hate to be the only person working on something."

Mitt Romney met with Jeb Bush shortly after he announced in December 2014 he would actively explore running for president. | AP Romney: Bush-Clinton matchup 'would be too easy for the Democrats'
Mitt Romney once told Jeb Bush that the former Florida governor couldn't beat Hillary Clinton in a general election.
Romney, the Republican nominee who challenged President Barack Obama during his 2012 reelection campaign and who last year weighed mounting another bid, expressed that notion in a private meeting with Bush in a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah, last January, according to Romney's comments to The Washington Post.
Story Continued Below
“Jeb, to be very honest, I think it's very hard for you to post up against Hillary Clinton and to separate yourself from the difficulty of the W. years and compare them with the Clinton years,” Romney recalled telling Bush, referring to former President George W. Bush's administration.
A Clinton-Bush election “would be too easy for the Democrats,” Romney told the Post.
“I like Jeb a lot,” Romney continued. “I think he'd be a great president but felt he was unfairly but severely burdened by the W. years — and when I say the W. years, it's not only what happened to the economy, but the tragedy in Iraq.”
During their Jan. 22, 2015, encounter, Romney said, Bush responded that he was going to run a campaign about the future, not the past.
“I didn't say anything at that point,” Romney remembered. “But as he left, I said to myself, ‘Gosh, in my opinion, it's not going to be as easy to make that separation as I think he gives the impression it will be.' One of the few things I predicted that turned out to be true.”
Bush has tried to distinguish himself from his brother and father, two former presidents, unveiling a “Jeb!” logo for his 2016 campaign that excludes his famous surname. But other candidates have invoked George W. Bush's presidency and the Iraq war throughout the campaign in attacks on Jeb Bush, and the former Florida governor has leaned heavily on his family's network to bolster his slowing fundraising.

A priest has launched an investigation after a Virgin Mary statue appeared to start 'crying tears of blood'.
The small icon of the Virgin of the Mystical Rose, one of the names Catholics use for the Virgin Mary, belongs to a family in Argentina's Salta province and is still in their home.
The Frías Mendoza family, who live in the city of San José de MetánSan, released the story through a local radio station.

As news of the phenomena spread, excited residents marched to the town square hoping to get a glimpse of what many believe is a miracle.
Hundreds of Catholics visited the house over several days as the family's dining room became makeshift shrine for the statue, local media reported .
But priest Julio Raúl Méndez has urged people not to jump to conclusions.
He said an investigation would look for a scientific or natural explanation before considering anything else.

Mr Méndez said: “The first thing the church does is to do a scientific analysis to see if there is a natural explanation. Only then, the possibility of a supernatural phenomenon is considered.”
There have been numerous reports of religious statues weeping over many years although only one has been certified by those in authority in the Catholic church, while most others have been proven to be hoaxes.
In 1984, following eight years of investigations, a wooden statue of Our Lady of Akita, another name for the Virgin Mary, in Japan, was found to have shed real blood, sweat and tears.

Someone yelling about a gun may have sent Houston's busiest hospital into a panic Tuesday, forcing a full evacuation.Patients were wheeled out in hospital beds, some still attached to medical equipment, as heavily armed police officers rushed into Ben Taub Hospital following reports of an active shooter around 2pm.An all-clear was given two hours later after Houston police conducted two searches through the hospital's six floors and basement.Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said there was "no evidence of shooter or shooting.""We responded very quickly and searched this hospital," Acevedo said.He said the hospital responded appropriately to the situation."I am confident that if there was a threat, that threat is not here now," he said.After initial reports, hundreds of staff, patients and family members were evacuated from the hospital, and no one knew exactly why."Everybody panicked and started running out," described one man who was at the hospital with his wife, a patient."They locked us all down and told us shots fired," said another woman.Witnesses at the scene described hearing an indistinguishable noise as everyone ran for the exits. The source of the scare seemed to have come from the second floor, where Barbara Mushinski talked to people in an office next to hers."They said they heard gunshots. Someone said put down the gun and they all went into a room and locked themselves up," Mushinski, a nurse, said.Law enforcement sources tell Eyewitness News someone just yelling about a gun might have ignited the response, though a few people claimed to have heard gunshots."The bottom line is there are multiple people that heard 'drop the gun,' and right after that, they heard two loud bangs. I mean, it's a hospital," said Chief Acevedo. "Who knows what the bangs were? But I believe the hospital responded appropriately, following their protocols, and the police department did a phenomenal job."Police found no bullet holes, no gun, no spent shell casings, no victims and no shooter. Investigators will review hospital video as part of their investigation.In October, a Harris County sheriff's deputy shot and wounded an inmate at Ben Taub Hospital who was holding a female medical student hostage Police said Ricky Lynn Hall took a piece of metal from inside of a pair of headphones provided by the hospital and made one end into a point that he held to the student's throat.
In the midtown Toronto areas of Leaside and Davisville, the real estate market has been bouncing between optimism and despair like a yo-yo.
Patrick Rocca, a real estate agent with Bosley Real Estate Ltd., has concentrated much of his business on the tree-lined streets radiating out from Bayview and Eglinton Avenues. The mainly traditional detached houses of Leaside appeal to well-heeled families who want room for the kids to run around. Swimming pools and home ice rinks are not uncommon in the spacious backyards. The slightly smaller lots and houses of Davisville are a little more affordable, in most cases, and especially popular with younger couples pushing strollers.
But even in those stalwart family neighbourhoods, real estate deals can be hard to put together these days, says Mr. Rocca, who has been shocked by the market's swings.

"You knew something was going to happen. It was mind-boggling. It was scary," he says of the market's unfettered rise in the spring and the Ontario government's moves to tame it. "I knew something was going to happen – I just didn't know how quickly it was going to stop."
A house that might have sold for $1.5-million in the fall of 2016 could have fetched $1.8-million in February. Now, it's back to $1.5-million.
So far in August, the market is still unpredictable, with some properties receiving multiple offers and others languishing.
"The sellers are still thinking March prices; the buyers are still thinking there's downside."
John Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty Inc., says sales in the first half of August in the Greater Toronto Area fell 42 per cent from the same period last year. Again, the drop in freehold properties was more severe, with a 46-per-cent fall compared with a 34-per-cent decline for condos.
The average price edged up a slim 2 per cent compared with the first half of August, 2016.
Mr. Rocca is coaching sellers to be more clear-eyed by showing them the figures from recent sales.

"They missed the boat. It's been difficult. They should have sold in March, but they didn't."
Gradually, homeowners are absorbing the news and changing their mindset, he says. That's a sign of progress compared with challenging conversations in May, when sellers didn't want to hear what he had to say.
As for house hunters, some want to believe they can offer $400,000 under the asking price and strike a deal. That may have worked earlier in the summer, Mr. Rocca says, but the twist now is that sellers have set their asking prices very close to the amount they can reasonably expect to receive. Agents have mostly given up on the practice of setting a dramatically low asking price in order to spark competition.
"A lot of these houses are priced right," Mr. Rocca says.
One set of buyers Mr. Rocca's office was working with was so ruthless, agents realized they were not going to find the deal they were after.
"We literally had to sever ties because they were like a shark looking for blood in the water."

He recently listed a detached, two-storey house in original condition in Leaside. The property received four offers, but all came in below the asking price of $1.5-million, he says. The sellers accepted the highest offer. In March, he's sure, they would have received $300,000 more.
Prices were escalating at an annual pace above 30 per cent before the Ontario government introduced policies designed to cool the market. One of those moves, a non-resident speculation tax, adds a 15-per-cent levy on real estate purchases by foreign buyers.
"I think the foreign tax really hit our area," Mr. Rocca says. "It hurt our market, no doubt."
Mr. Rocca sold one house in February that had 11 competing buyers show up at the table.
"Everyone was foreign," he says.
The uncertainty surrounding the impact of the new measures also prompted homeowners who were debating whether to sell to take action. New listings burgeoned.

"It scared people into throwing a ton of product on the market," Mr. Rocca says.
Scott Ingram, a real estate agent with Century 21 Regal Realty Inc., points out that prices drop from June to July every year, so it's not unexpected for it to happen again this year. In the past 22 years, the smallest dip has been less than 1 per cent and the largest 11.5 per cent, his analysis shows.
This year's decline was 7.3 per cent, which he points out is not significantly more severe than the average of 6.1 per cent.
Mr. Ingram also notes that the average price of a freehold property in the 416 area soared a dizzying $290,000 in the four months from December, 2016, to April, 2017, when it reached $1.455-million. But as of July, that average price had given up most of that increase to stand at $1.177-million, or $12,000 above the December price. Mr. Ingram includes detached, semi-detached and freehold townhouses in that figure.
Mr. Rocca says some buyers who purchased in the spring have become spooked by the decline in prices in the past few months. Tales of buyer's remorse are common. Some buyers are trying to back out of deals or renegotiate. Mr. Rocca understands the predicament; he has clients who purchased a bungalow on a very good street with the intention of selling it again for a profit.
"They paid a big buck," he says. "They paid $1.9-million. Now, that bungalow's worth $1.6-million. It's scary."

Still, they didn't back out of the deal. Mr. Rocca says buyers must understand that they've signed a contract. People who think they can simply forfeit a deposit and walk away may end up being sued by the sellers. The buyers will then risk having to add legal fees to their purchase price.
"They're on the hook," he says. "They're going to have to cough up anyway – they should have closed."
He's heard of some sellers being pressed to take a cut of $300,000 to $400,000 from the amount the buyer offered in the spring.
"That's a huge spread."
He says some sellers will agree to a smaller reduction because it's easier than the hassle of trying to relist the property. As for the buyers, his advice to his own clients would be to go through with the transaction.
"I'd tell them, you'd better close on your property because you're going to get sued."

Mr. Rocca says overseas buyers are starting to come back to the market, but not in the numbers he saw earlier in the year. Some are looking for loopholes so they can avoid the non-resident speculators tax.
For homeowners who are considering listing soon, Mr. Rocca believes the first half of the fall market will be better than the second, as it is most years. But for those who can afford to wait, he thinks holding off until the spring will be a better bet. He's not sure that prices will return to the level of March, 2017, he cautions, but there may be more potential buyers eager to buy than in the fall.
"Spring is always your best market."
Mr. Rocca believes the coming fall market will stabilize after so many gyrations, but he adds that some factors are still unpredictable. The Bank of Canada could lift its benchmark rate again after the first rate hike in seven years in July. Mr. Rocca says another move to tighten could cast a chill or it could prompt potential buyers to jump in more quickly before any more increases take effect.
Looking ahead to next month, Mr. Ingram expects homeowners will be ready to list soon after Labour Day, but buyers won't all rush back at once. That dynamic – with anxious sellers and leery buyers – will likely lead to a swell in active listings.
OTTAWA—They talked about it before the game. Misfits, they called themselves. The Toronto Argonauts had been in last place the year before, and so many of them had to be discarded before they were here. This was a last-place team that didn't have a coach or general manager until March, and then was flung together. The Calgary Stampeders were heavy favourites. The Argonauts drew fewer than half as many fans as those guys, all season. Misfits. “The forgotten toys,” said offensive lineman Chris Van Zeyl, who had to be cut by Montreal before he was an Argo. “You know what I mean?”

With five minutes left Sunday in the 105th Grey Cup, the Stampeders were up eight points. They hadn't trailed all game. On a snowy night in Ottawa, a strange night, a very Canadian night, the Argos couldn't quite get in the game. They had a chance to fall on a fourth-quarter fumble that could have changed everything; the Stampeders got it, and Bo Levi Mitchell threw a 50-yard pass. Calgary blew this game last year, and they were close to sealing this one. On the Argos sideline they got to miracle territory. Hope for a miracle, because that was all that was left. “I've been in several Grey Cups that have ended some crazy ways, that were shocking, I promise you that,” Argos general manager Jim Popp said. “And I'm sitting there going, you know what? We're going to pull this off. And I felt that way all week.” “Just praying. Everybody's praying,” said receiver DeVier Posey, who caught seven passes for 175 yards and was named the game's MVP. “Pretty sure God was ready to hang up the phone.”

These Argonauts team shouldn't have been here. They were stitched together, with Popp and head coach Marc Trestman trying to make up for lost time. Trestman never raised his voice, never tore them apart, even when they started 4-7. He kept at it. Quarterback Ricky Ray kept at it. They couldn't draw a real crowd at BMO Field. They all kept going. And then a ball fell on the ground. Calgary's Kamar Jorden got hit inside the 10, and a split-second before his knee hit the turf the ball came out. Cassius Vaughn got cut by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in May, along with five other guys, and the Argos picked him up. He grabbed the ball and ran, weaving, accompanied. He ran 109 yards. A few seconds later, the game was tied. If miracles happen, that was one. “I didn't actually see it, to be honest with you,” Van Zeyl said. “I had my face in my hands, and I was praying. And Bo Levi Mitchell's a great quarterback.” He looked up. “All I can say is our defence balled out. They changed this game for us. I'm looking up at the scoreboard, and I still don't know how this happened.” The defence got Ricky Ray the ball back and he made the throws, the same throws he's been making for 16 years. His offensive line held off the Stampeders monsters who had made the first three quarters a series of attempted escapes. The field goal went through. The Stampeders had 49 seconds and they drove to the Toronto 25. Mitchell wasn't scared, and he took a shot at the end zone. He probably shouldn't have. Because he didn't see the little guy in the middle of the end zone, the one who saw the ball coming. He didn't see Matt Black. Toronto 27, Calgary 24, for the 17th Grey Cup in Argos history.

“How about Matt Black for the game-winning interception?” Posey said. “That's our team, man.” “It's so special,” said Black, an Argo since 2008, still cradling the ball he intercepted. “It's so special being a part of this group.”

“What about his story?” Trestman said. “I cut him. I cut him (on Aug. 1), and I wouldn't have brought him back, but he left with class. He didn't burn any bridges, and he's got a message to send somebody. You don't always get what you want, but you deal with it with class. And then a door opens. And you say, that guy's got class, he can come back. And he's got a story to tell that nobody can ever take away from him.” That's what the Argos won. They went from last place to a group of guys thrusts together and stitched together by a coach who told them — and it sounds hackneyed, it really does — to love each other. Posey said, “I think what we proved was that love wins. I remember when we lost a few games, and coach Trestman said, I'm not going to rip you guys. I'm going to show you good plays. And we're going to be better. Let's work on each other. Let's fight harder for James (Wilder), let's block harder for James. And it's just, he shows love. I don't know how else to say it. In life, in football.” “Everybody had so much love for each other, and coach Trestman set that up for us,” said Ray, whose cool exterior finally cracked. “It just felt like this team was too special for it to end any other way for us.” They were surrounded on the slippery cold field by their parents and children, their brothers and sisters, their teammates and friends, in a place of pure unexpected elation. Linebacker Marcus Ball said, “Calgary is a damned awesome, awesome, great team. But you know what? We Grey Cup champs. Quote that.” Team president Michael Copeland, glassy-eyed, his wife and two daughters at his side, tried not to cry. “I'm really proud of everybody in our organization that believed we could do this,” Copeland said. “The game was like the season. Ups and downs, times you had to have faith, times you have to believe. The guys never gave up. And we're champions.” Calgary, meanwhile, spilled their guts on the floor. They were haunted by that loss to Ottawa last year, and it followed them all year, and they thought this time it would be different. They will see the 100-yard pass that beat a corner, Tommie Campbell, who hadn't been burned like that all season. They will see Jorden's fumble, and they will see the last pass Bo threw. They will see the field goals that vanished with both plays, in a game they lost by a field goal. “We've got a great organization, great management,” Calgary coach Dave Dickenson said. “We've got winners on our team, great football players, great staff. Lot of good things there. We just can't seem to find a way to get that ring. “I couldn't give them much, I really couldn't. It was too fresh, too hard. Any words I say will not resonate. They're just words. Words don't win. Actions do. Man, that was a tough one. It's going to hurt. And the problem is, you can't change what happened, you can't change the past. So don't forget to live, go forth, do what you've got to do.” “It's just a tough, tough loss for our team. It just didn't happen for us.” But it happened for Toronto. This was a great week in Ottawa. The town that never gets called fun was tremendous. The area around the stadium was a party. This town has what Toronto wants, football-wise. It has fans. It has a community. Toronto, though, delivered this to the fans who have stuck with this franchise through the lean years, the absurd years, the years where being an Argos fan got lonelier and lonelier. The misfits. Trestman was discarded by the NFL and came back here, and he told these players to love one another. And he won. “We all have our wounds,” Trestman said. “And we've talked about that along the way. And what I'm most proud of is every guy now has a story. That they can share with people that they love, and who will listen. And it's a good story. And it never goes away. And that's what this is all for. It's not for the ring, it's not for the championship. It's for the testimony that if people come together they can become part of something bigger than themselves. And it's a real story.” “Misfits,” Posey said. His arms were inside his championship T-shirt, and he shivered in the cold, but he wanted to live this, because it was real. “We've all been told no before, and we said we're going to rely on each other, we're going to love each other.” “Look what it got us. Eternity, etched in stone, for life. I'll never forget this.”

First, three U.S. regional groups of the Seventh-day Adventist Church voted in 2012 for women to be ordained.
Then, the church's Southeastern California Conference elected its first female president, a historic move for the global church.
Now, four of the church's 13 worldwide divisions have approved theological reviews suggesting that women's ordination should be widely accepted; one has said it should not.
As one of the fastest-growing religious groups in the U.S. and across the world, Seventh-day Adventists could potentially influence other denominations — particularly conservative Christians — on the issue of women in leadership.
For now, statements from church headquarters in Silver Spring, Md., focus less on gender and more on concern that regional church bodies have forged ahead with their own decisions without consensus from the wider denomination.
“It's a controversy that has been brewing in Adventism for decades that church administrators can't ignore and haven't ignored,” said Laura Vance, a sociologist at Warren Wilson College in Asheville, N.C., who has studied women within Adventism.
“What's coming to a head now is that some Adventists are moving ahead and ordaining women in violation of church policy.”
Despite what appears to be a steady move toward affirming women's ordination, leaders on both sides of the debate say the jury is still out on a final verdict. World leaders of the church, which is best known for its Saturday observance of the Sabbath, will review the 13 division recommendations, possibly at the church's 2015 General Conference.
Sandra Roberts, the newly elected president of the Southeastern California Conference, said she is “cautiously optimistic” after the church's North American Division signaled approval of female clergy.
But she adds: “I don't know where it will all lead.”
Executive officers of the worldwide church, which was co-founded by a woman, Ellen White, issued a statement after Roberts' Oct. 27 election, calling it “troubling” that “personal convictions” were placed ahead of “collective policy.”
“It deeply concerns the world leadership of the church that recently a local conference constituency elected as a conference president an individual who is not recognized by the world church as an ordained minister,” the officers said.
Holding a Bible in his left hand, SDA President Ted N.C. Wilson cautioned against “worldly influences” and “the danger of disunity” in a recent “State of the Church” video.
“To discard or ignore these mutual agreements violates a sacred trust and creates unnecessary discord,” he said.
Vance, author of a forthcoming book on women in new religious movements that includes a chapter on Adventists, said Adventists have, for now, struck a kind of compromise: “The position of the church leadership has been to allow women to move in the direction of doing everything that ordained ministers do without allowing them to be ordained.” One exception: serving as senior pastors.
Pastor Courtney Ray is one aberration. Ordained in January in the California-based Pacific Union Conference, she is an interim senior pastor of a church in Compton, Calif. She previously chose not to take the “commissioned” credential, which women pastors have held without being ordained.
“The Adventist Church is a worldwide church and I think that if you wait for everyone to feel comfortable doing ... everything at the same time, that slows down progress in every aspect,” she said. “I think that unity is important, but I think that unity does not mean uniformity.”
Finding that balance is key for a faith group that has studied this issue for decades and previously concluded “the time is not right or opportune” for ordaining women.
“The challenge right now is how to do this in a way that respects the conscience of other cultures and just provide unity with maybe not uniformity,” said Beverly Beem, an English professor at Adventist-related Walla Walla University who has written on women and Adventism.
Some wonder if the church's British-based Trans-European Division, which recommended inclusive ministry “where it is culturally appropriate,” might be an example to follow.
In the U.S., 19 female pastors have been ordained or had their credentials updated in the SDA's mid-Atlantic Columbia Union Conference since that regional group approved women's ordination in July 2012. The Pacific Union Conference estimates it has 25 to 30 ordained women.
The SDA's Nebraska-based Mid-America Union Conference also approved women's ordination in 2012, but no women in its nine-state territory have been recommended for ordination.
Despite the advances by some women, critics say the Bible remains clear on women in leadership, and the church should, too.
“I feel like the Bible hasn't changed while our culture has, and so if I'm going to be a Bible Christian, then the traditional understanding that there's a distinction between men and women is still unchanged,” said Pastor Doug Batchelor, who leads a church in Sacramento, Calif., and is a member of the worldwide church's Theology of Ordination Study Committee.
Duke Divinity School scholar Mark Chaves sees a link between women's ordination and broader embracing of modernity.
“Acceptance of women's leadership is continuing to increase in American Christianity, even among conservatives,” said Chaves, who is working on the third wave of the National Congregations Study and has seen a slight increase in congregations' allowance of women leaders between 2006 and 2012.
Garrett Caldwell, spokesman for the world church, said the deliberative process will come down to a single question: “Does the Bible have a theology of ordination that says yes or no about this issue?”
He said the Trans-European Division's “culturally appropriate” compromise could be one answer, as well as either blanket permission or a continued churchwide ban on ordained women.
“I hope that there will be a good resolution to this one way or another,” said Roberts, the denomination's only woman conference president. “Even if it's that each division is allowed to do what the division wishes to do. That may be the best possible outcome.”

In 2001, UFC co-founder Campbell McLaren made the difficult decision to sell the company for $2 million — a price tag that seems minuscule given that the MMA promotion just sold for a staggering $4 billion.
Of course, the UFC was very different back then. More spectacle than sport, MMA was on the brink of extinction before Zuffa LLC — the company headed by the Fertitta brothers and Dana White — purchased the name and gradually reinvented the brand.
Fast-forward 15 years, and McLaren was among the bidders looking to acquire the UFC once Lorenzo Fertitta made it known that the MMA leader was on the market. Though his proposed price tag fell short, McLaren remains a busy man in the fight game, putting his full attention on building up burgeoning Hispanic MMA franchise Combate Americas.
Earlier this week, I caught up with Campbell to talk about the UFC sale, what it means to Lorenzo and Dana, and how he thinks it impacts the greater mixed martial arts landscape.
You were part of a group that submitted a $2.8 billion bid for the UFC. Are you surprised at the group led by WME-IMG paying a reported $4 billion for the promotion?
I'm not surprised that the figure was that high. I think Lorenzo Fertitta wanted to sell the company for a number that represented what it could be in the coming years with Europe and Asia coming on. If a company like KKR bought it for $4 billion, that means they think it's worth $8 billion — those guys are very sharp.
What I was surprised by was in February when I heard Lorenzo wanted to sell. To a great extent, (WME-IMG) has bought MMA. The UFC is such a clear leader in MMA it's as if you bought soccer or football or baseball. You're not buying one team; you're buying a sport.
*I'm thrilled too because Combate Americas' valuation goes up. I've literally been flooded by offers to invest more in Combate Americas. So, I would say I'm not surprised by the number, but very happy with the number.
*Combate Americas debuted on Fight Pass, the UFC's digital streaming service, in April.
Do you have preexisting relationships with anyone in the WME-IMG ownership group?
I do know (Co-CEO) Ari Emanuel. He's a very smart guy who obviously has a lot of show business experience. I have a tremendous respect for him. But combat sports is obviously a very different thing, so Ari will have a learning curve to deal with.
One thing I find interesting is that Dana White is going to speak for Donald Trump at the Republican Convention, and Ari's brother Rahm was actually President Obama's Chief of Staff. That should lead to some interesting discussions (laughs).
What are the biggest changes you see on the horizon with this new ownership group, both internally and with partner organizations like Combate Americas?
I don't have a crystal ball, but I look at this and think: The UFC is going to continue to be driven to be a world-class sport. It's probably going to become — and I don't mean this in a bad way — in some sense, very corporate. Decisions are going to make much more for the bottom line, and you're going to continue to see the sport mature and be presented in a more ... not cookie-cutter, but standardized way.
Fight fans might look at an organization like Combate Americas and see that it offers an alternative to that with guys that are new and hungry for success. A franchise that takes more chances, presents more colorful fighters, maybe going back to the old days a little bit.
Do you think some of the things going on behind the scenes like the Muhammad Ali Act and the class-action lawsuit that's being brought against the UFC helped prompt the sale?
I don't think those things influenced Lorenzo. I think the sale was more in his not so secret desire to own an NFL team.
The Ali Act was never used against anyone in boxing. Why would it be used against anyone in MMA? The lawsuit that's pending … I don't think that's going anywhere. After all, isn't Bellator owned by Viacom ? Viacom is a huge media organization that owns Bellator … so how has the UFC cornered the market if Viacom is also in the market? The fact is that the UFC is good at what it does … it doesn't mean the UFC is restricting trade.
What about the fact that the UFC's star power is at an all-time high? Over the past year or so, fighters like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey really seem to have elevated the sport. Could that have influenced their decision to sell?
The sport has clearly come into a new era. I think the sport is very star driven now, but back when I ran the UFC in the old days, Royce Gracie helped drive it, Ken Shamrock helped drive it … it's always been star driven. MMA has a certain appeal to hardcore fans that's always been there, but these stars come in — Conor and Ronda being good examples — and they drive interest to a whole new group of fans. Look at women in the sport … not just participating, but really becoming top ticket-sellers. That's a whole new market that's just arrived for the sport.
Again, I want to emphasize that I don't think Lorenzo got out because he didn't think things would be even better in the future. I think he wants to be part of the NFL.
Dana's new deal is structured so he now holds a 9% stake in the UFC's profits over the next five years. What do you see happening to him down the line? Does he stay on long-term or is this a transitionary period?
Number one: Who's the real star of the UFC? Is it Ronda, is it Conor, or is it Dana? You know, I would have to say that it's Dana. No one sits on the fence with him — you either love him, or you don't. He's been the face, the heart and soul, of the UFC. He understands fighters and he understands fans — and fans so associate Dana with the UFC, I can't imagine him not being with it in the future.
Where do you see Dana and the new ownership groups really making those profits, though? What are the big markets that are going to open up over the course of his contract?
China is obviously a very big market, but you've also got to look elsewhere. The UFC has done very well in the UK, Canada and Australia, but it really has a great deal of room to grow in non-English speaking countries. France and Germany, for example, are huge territories in Europe. You've got literally all of Asia. So Europe and Asia are wide open for the UFC. I think that's a big reason KKR comes in for $4 billion, probably thinking it's an $8 billion company.
We're actually about to announce (Combate Americas') international expansion into Mexico, another region the UFC is just starting to move into. So we're really going to be going head-to-head with the UFC in Mexico. It's going to be interesting to see how we do in the next year going up against the mighty UFC.
Does that at all impact your current Fight Pass deal, and relationship with the UFC moving forward?
Both Lorenzo and Dana have been very supportive of Combate Americas, and I don't think that's going to change. Lorenzo has even admitted a number of the times that the UFC hasn't been very good at drawing U.S. Hispanic fans, and there are a lot of reasons for that.
Is it going to affect our relationship? Look, they're a $4 billion company. Our valuation right now is around $40 million. So you're looking at a big difference. I'm not going to worry them too much. I think we're going to be bringing new fans to the sport without taking anything away from the UFC.
TRILOGY-ACS TRIAL
Problem UA/NSTEMI no for revasc.
Format Randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-control, event-driven trial
Treatment Prasugrel
Control Clopidogrel
Population 9326 patients
Inclusion criteria UA/NSTEMI with medical management without revascularization within 10 days after the index event.
-NSTEMI patients had elevated cardiac markers, whereas patients with unstable angina with negative cardiac markers had an ST-segment depression of more than 1 mm in two or more electrocardiographic leads
At least one of four risk criteria:
1) An age of at least 60 years
2) The presence of diabetes mellitus
3) Previous myocardial infarction
4) Previous revascularization with either PCI or coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG).
Angiography was not required for enrollment, but if such a procedure was planned, it had to be performed before randomization. Patients who underwent angiography were required to have evidence of coronary disease (native coronary stenosis of >30% or previous PCI or CABG)
Exclusion criteria History of transient ischemic attack or stroke, PCI or CABG within the previous 30 days
Renal failure requiring dialysis
Concomitant treatment with an oral anticoagulant
Follow-up Median 17.1 months
Primary endpoint Composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke among patients under the age of 75 years
Secondary endpoint(s) First occurrence of: cardiovascular death or MI
Cardiovascular death, MI, stroke, or rehospitalization for recurrent UA
All-cause death, MI, or stroke
Stent thrombosis
Although TRILOGY ACS will enroll medically managed patients, rates of stent thrombosis will be examined per regulatory requirements because it is anticipated that some subjects will have undergone previous coronary stenting before the index ACS event or may undergo coronary stenting during study follow-up for a recurrent ischemic event.
Details Patients who underwent randomization within 72 hours after the first medical contact without previous clopidogrel treatment received a loading dose of 30 mg of prasugrel or 300 mg of clopidogrel, which was followed by daily blinded maintenance administration of a study drug.
The prasugrel maintenance dose was 10 mg, which was adjusted to 5 mg for patients who were 75 years of age or older or who weighed less than 60 kg. The clopidogrel maintenance dose was 75 mg for all patients. Pharmacokinetic modeling from previous trials showed that 5 mg of prasugrel in patients weighing less than 60 kg resulted in an antiplatelet effect that was similar to that for 10 mg in heavier patients.
The 5-mg dose that was used in participants 75 years of age or older had not been evaluated in previous outcomes trials.
A Brave New World For Advertising?
The Basic Attention Token, a new digital token could change the way users, publishers and advertisers interact with adverts, a well needed change since AdBlock Plus has been downloaded over 500 million times, and Adblocking will cost publishers a $27B by 2020.
What is the Basic Attention Token?
It is a utility token which can be used by publishers, advertisers and users on the Brave browser.
Use cases include:
• Users receiving BAT's for viewing an advert
• Spending BAT's on premium products
• Donating BAT's to publishers etc.
Brave Browser
Brave is a web browser with a built-in ad blocking system, its creators claim that Brave to run up to 7x times faster than regular browsers due to the removal of adverts which can slow down web page loading speed. Users will be able to opt in to run ads on the browser and receive BAT's in return for their attention.
Why I think this could work
Rewarding people for viewing adverts could prove successful on the Brave browser, it has already been used in mobile gaming apps and I believe that as long as there is a good use for the BAT tokens then users will happily spend time watching ads to earn some BATs.
Take Bitcoin Billionaire for example
You can watch ads to double coin rewards or earn coins
Or you can enable less intrusive banner ads for coin rewards
You can then spend the coins on investments that increase bitcoin generation and upgrades that include house decorations and stronger bitcoin miners.
Personally I always took the opportunity to watch and enable as many ads as possible since I was being rewarded with virtual coins which served a purpose inside the game.
Is BAT a good investment?
Before I answer that question firstly, BAT's are not intended to be a cryptocurrency or store of value. However if the Brave team can create some interesting uses for the BAT (movie streaming, subscription services similar to Netflix, Spotify or Patreon etc.) that could generate a lot of demand leading users to try and acquire BAT through viewing adds, creating content or purchasing them from exchanges.
The Brave team has made mention of the possibility of BAT's being used on browsers other than Brave as well as being used on Ethereum based messaging/payment platforms such as CoinBase's Toshi (formerly named Token) and Status, other possible use cases include WeChat and Telegram.
Let's not also forget that Brendan Eich, the creator of Javascript and co-founder of the Mozilla Corporation is the man behind the Brave browser and its Basic Attention Token, so this project is definitely worth watching long term.
I believe the Basic Attention Token is worth a small investment at its current price of $0.11 or you can wait for a lower entry point as the price has been steadily dropping.
Will we be seeing any Basic Attention Token Millionaires some day? Only time will tell

Read: The Counter-History of Philosophy
This commentary and review is based on the book Las sabidurías de la antigüedad: Contrahistoria de la filosofía, a Spanish-language translation of a book (not yet available in English) by French philosopher Michel Onfray. He is the founder of the Université Populaire de Caen, which provides a free liberal education, and is one of the most prominent public intellectuals in France today.
After witnessing the rise of the right-wing ideology of Le Pen–and the intellectual decadence that led to it–, Onfray felt that the French Republic needed to invest in the formation of new intellectuals. Feeling that the academic world had failed by giving too much undeserved importance to Plato and the idealists, and too little to Epicurus and the materialists, he set out to argue that the West needs a “counter-history of philosophy” from the perspective of the “friends of Epicurus and the enemies of Plato”.
Historiography as Warfare
In our discussion of Nietzsche's philosophy, I mentioned (and criticized) some Nietzschean views which have had great influence in Onfray and serve, to a great extent, as presuppositions:
To Nietzsche, truth and reality are the concoction of someone who, in the process of positing a narrative of reality, is acting upon and exerting power over reality, creating reality. … There are no facts, only interpretation.
The influence of Nietzsche in Onfray was also explored in his argument that there is a Nietzschean leftist ideology, a way of philosophizing that is Nietzschean “insofar as it takes Nietzsche as the starting point”.
We must start with Onfray's Nietzschean influence because Onfray–like Nietzsche–recognizes that narrative is power and declares that we are at war. It is a war of ideas and ideologies, a war between materialists and idealists, between atomists and theologians, between creationists and scientists. Two cosmologies (in their many varieties) that can not be reconciled have been at war for millennia. We may think of them as the “culture wars” today. This is the subject of Onfray's counter-history, and it frames his way of practicing philosophy.
Onfray says that the writing of history is in itself an act of war, that it is ideological and that there is a strategy, a series of goals, and a variety of methods of writing history that demonstrate the ways in which the intellectual battle is fought. Sometimes war is waged by imposing invisibility and silence on others; at other times it is by accentuating this or that piece of evidence.
Onfray starts with Plato himself, who never mentions Democritus directly, although his entire philosophy is a war-machine against Democritus. Plato's tactic here is to ignore, to omit, to silence the enemy, so as to diminish and disregard his value. In one passage discussing Aristoxenus, Onfray narrates how Plato once insinuated that the works of Democritus should be burnt, but two Pythagoreans persuaded him not to burn them. At all times, Onfray convicts Plato of knowingly engaging in an ideological battle, a problem which is made worse by the fact that in the “official” history of philosophy, there haven't been enough attempts to find the real voice of his opponents.
The academic world has adopted the Platonic narrative and delegated Democritus in the history books to the status of a “pre-Socratic”, which trivializes his intellectual achievement as the inventor of atomism, although Democritus lived at the same time as Socrates. Democritus was born in 460, Socrates in 470. Perhaps it's easy enough for historians to fit facts and people into neat categories, but the myth of the “three classical philosophers”–Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle–has been perpetuated unthinkingly ad nauseam by academia, and has attributed an unfair amount of importance to these three to the detriment of all the others.
Onfray begins his counter-history by setting the record straight: Democritus, the inventor (together with Leucippus) of atomism and the first of the Laughing Philosophers is NOT a pre-Socratic. Democritus is the first anti-Platonist, active at the same time as Plato. Democritus and Plato start two separate philosophical lineages. The counter-history of philosophy gives us the narrative of the “other” lineage.
Plato knew Aristippus–the founder of hedonist doctrine–and was familiar with him and his opinions. Proof of this is that he mentions Aristippus directly when he reproaches his absence at Socrates' death. But instead of using Aristippus as the mouthpiece of hedonism, he used the (fictional?) character of Philebus, merely a literary figure to embody pleasure in one of his “dialogues”. Plato doesn't let Philebus talk or defend himself properly. Plato also exhibits ill-will when he exaggerates and caricatures his hedonist opponent, and then in the end portrays the character as going off running after a boy.
Why choose a fictional character to speak for a philosophy that has real proponents with real, coherent doctrines? Here, again, Plato's war machine uses omission, silencing, ignoring his opponent, as if this demonstrated the validity of Plato's arguments. We are reminded of how the Socrates that we know is Plato's Socrates: we never hear of the Socrates that inspired the Cynics, or the Hedonists, or any of the other philosophical lineages that claimed him.
In view of the conflict of ideas that has taken place throughout history, Onfray argues that Mount Vesuvius protected the Herculaneum scrolls from Christian fury and fanaticism; that if the eruption of 79 CE hadn't charred the papyri, we would have never gotten access to most of the works in Philodemus' villa.
Striking a Blow for Epicurus
In his exposé of a religious fraud, the Epicurean satirist Lucian of Samosata included a revealing passage about “striking a blow for Epicurus” which demonstrates that the Epicureans, ancient as well as modern, have always seen ourselves as waging an intellectual battle:
… I was still more concerned (a preference which you may be far from resenting) to strike a blow for Epicurus, that great man whose holiness and divinity of nature were not shams, who alone had and imparted true insight into the good, and who brought deliverance to all that consorted with him.
This passage testifies to the fact that in the 2nd Century CE, Lucian saw himself as engaged in a fist-fight through the use of comedy and literature. Contemporary Epicureans generally hold the view that the ONLY way to understand Epicurus in depth is by understanding how rabidly anti-Plato he was: some have even argued that his entire system of philosophy can be understood mostly as a detailed, point-by-point refutation of Plato, who replaced nature with ideas. Ideas are okay, they're just not “things” existing on their own–without matter–in the ether, or the plethora, or whatever the superstitious Platonists called the ideal realm.
Epicurus' expulsion from Mitilene by the Platonists who had assumed control of the gymnasium, under threat of being accused of blasphemy, is another pivotal historical incident that usually escapes scrutiny by historians–even by Onfray himself. We know from the sources that this was a difficult season to travel by sea and that his ship capsized and he nearly lost his life. We know that this made Epicurus careful, and that he later on avoided preaching his philosophy in the agora, preferring the privacy of his Garden. But, why were the Platonists so offended by the idea of things being made up of atoms, or by the belief that life should be pleasant? What arguments and discussions can we speculate that they had with Epicurus prior to the expulsion?
Attempts to answer these questions may help to reveal many important issues of controversy, including the Epicureans' passionate indignation with superstition and with the endless, pointless, irrelevant speculation of the other philosophers. This deserves its own series of imaginary “dialogues”.
Reconciling with Nature
In terms of how materialists and idealists philosophize, the two lineages are either difficult or impossible to reconcile: we philosophize from the body, we value the senses, the instincts, and the faculties–pleasure and aversion. We value emotions: Philodemus treats anger as a source of insight and says it can be rational and natural, whereas the Platonists have carried out a complete denaturalization and decontextualization of morality and philosophy. They invented an unnatural split between body and mind to devalue the body and elevate the imaginary, disembodied “spirit”. This was easily dismantled by Epicurus when he re-integrated the psyche within the body.
Onfray calls Platonism “the great neurosis at the heart of Western civilization”. It's not just our happiness that suffers as a result of it. There is MUCH more at stake, including our connection with reality. Epicurus is still important and relevant today because his entire system is not only coherent, but also entirely based on the study of nature.
The Individual Versus the Polis
Following the logic of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”, Onfray brings many intellectuals from diverse traditions together, whom he sees as fighting the war against Plato. In doing so, I admit that the comparison of hedonists with cynics seems a bit forced at times. But he does note the tension that exists between nature (fisos, body) and law (nomos), between the individual (and her freedom) and the polis (and its culture), as an underlying thread in the culture wars.
The Four Cures are a Philodeman invention, to which Onfray offers an alternative that includes what he calls a “tranquil atheism”. While discussing the Lucretian parable of the fortress of the wise–which is a beautiful defense of individualist ethics as distinct from the vulgarities of the masses–Onfray declares:
Hedonism does not require selfishness, or an evil joy (while seeing the suffering of others), but the construction of one's self as a citadel, an impregnable fortress.
That the Epicurean chooses to be an individual and to focus on his own self-cultivation is not to be understood as obeying some commandment to be apolitical. Onfray claims that, while Philodemus rejects the autocracy of tyrants and the democracy of the vulgar masses, he prefers a king under the influence of philosophy. The source for this is unclear, but this should not impede us from forming our own ideals for the kind of government that leads most easily to a life of pleasure, of autarchy, and of ataraxia for its individuals, as surely Thomas Jefferson–an Epicurean himself–did when he wrote the words “pursuit of happiness” into the Declaration of Independence.
Perhaps a contemporary “ideal King” might be best embodied by the former President of Uruguay José Mujica, who specifically mentioned Epicurus while speaking to the community of nations, and who was subsequently celebrated at the annual symposium of Epicurean philosophy in Athens. Mujica is known for his moderate leftist-libertarian politics, for his authenticity and simple living in spite of earning a presidential salary, for his avowed atheism, and his call on all Latin Americans and Westerners to rethink the inherited values–most importantly consumerism–as “Christianity has failed us”, he says.
A leader who is adored by people throughout Latin America and the world, Mujica is acutely aware of the importance of disciplining our desires, and of the dangers posed by neoliberalism and by the capitalist model that requires constant growth, preferring instead a sustainable model of capitalist enterprise. Under his leadership, Uruguay has become the most prosperous nation in Latin America. It enjoys today liberal social policies, a high quality of life, and a poverty rate below 2%.
The House of Piso
Philodemus didn't just challenge the stereotype of Epicureans as apolitical: he developed the Epicurean tradition in other ways, and challenged the stereotype of Epicureans as minimalists who live frugally. Philodemus taught philosophy to wealthy Romans–including Caesar's own father-in-law. With him, the Epicurean tradition demonstrated–as it is consistent with its own teaching–that it was willing to embrace luxuries when no disadvantages ensued from their enjoyment. This is a philosophy for men and women of all social classes.
The House of Piso was not the austere Garden of the original founders. Together with its library and cultural life, it resembled a more grand temple of refined pleasure. The villa at Herculaneum overlooked the Mediterranean Sea and was a fortress of refinement, culture, and luxury. We will get another glimpse into the vibrant cultural life contained within its walls when we study Horace's Epistle to the Pisos.
Some Counter-History Trivia
The writing of Michel Onfray is peppered with references of interest to the student of Epicurean philosophy. Among some of the trivia points:
it's a well known fact that we have overly high levels of C02 in the earth's atmosphere, which are in turn contributing to global warming. it's always a very well known fact that all around the world' people are innovating and inventing ways to produce sustainable energy, and reduce these levels of C02 in the air. however, it's a slightly lesser known fact that other industries, such as farmers, chefs, and scientists, actually need C02 to do their jobs-whether it is in making dry ice to freeze food, or supplying crops with it to speed up growth. and as absurd as it may sound, we are in fact producing extra C02 to supply to these causes, when we already have far too much of the stuff.

so, why can't we simply extract the carbon dioxide from the air, and use it for these purposes? well, that's exactly what climeworks, a zurich-based c02 extraction company, have worked out how to do. founded by engineers christoph gebald and jan wurzbacher, the startup have just opened their first direct air capture plant near the swiss capital, which can filter around 900 tonnes of C02 from the earth's atmosphere annually and supply it to a nearby greenhouse to help grow vegetables. the project takes the title as world's first commercial plant that captures atmospheric C02 for supply and sale to a customer.
the direct air capture plant can capture 900 tonnes of C02 annually
whilst the 2016 paris agreement binds countries to keep the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C higher than what it used to be before we started burning up fossil fuels, it's a hefty challenge. although significant strides are being made to find renewable and sustainable energy sources, it doesn't suffice to meet the target. stopping the increase in the earth's temperature requires some serious reverse engineering. in other worlds, it's not enough to simply stop polluting the air with C02–need to start extracting some of the carbon dioxide that is already there.
the plant works by using a special filter to which the C02 molecules bind
this type of technology–logically named negative emissions technology–captures atmospheric carbon with a filter. the molecules of C02 then stay chemically bound to the filter by the moisture from the air, whilst the clean air is exhaled back into the atmosphere. once the filter becomes saturated with C02, it is heated, released from the filter, and collected as a concentrated gas to supply to customers. the filter can be reused many times, and lasts for several thousand cycles.
whilst C02 molecules stay stuck to the filter, the plant breaths clean air back into the atmosphere
the CO2 captured by climeworks can be used to carbonate beverages or produce climate neutral fuels and other materials. in fact, the zurich-based plant directly provides a continuous supply of CO2 through an underground pipeline to a greenhouse 400m away to assist with growing vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers.
the plant supplies the C02 to help grow vegetables in a nearby greenhouse
in coming months, climeworks plans to launch additional projects, and start working on the many more direct air capture plants it would need to remove 1% of the earth's C02. ‘we're working hard to reach the goal of filtering one per cent of global CO2 emissions by 2025,' explains christoph gebald, co-founder and managing director of climeworks. ‘to achieve this, we estimate around 250,000 DAC-plants like the one near zurich are necessary.'

A Vancouver real estate agent who has just sold a home for $567,000 over its published listing price says that underlisting is an accepted selling strategy in the real estate market.
"If the product's right, the timing's right and the inventory is right, it's the right strategy," Paul Eviston told CBC News.
Nevertheless, Eviston said, he would hesitate from using the term "underlisted" in the case of the home at 65 E 26th Ave., originally listed at $1.6 million, which sold for $2,167,000.
"I wouldn't call it underlisted," he said. "I would call it strategically listed to garner the interest level that we wanted to get the result that we got."
Sitting two blocks west of Main Street — both a physical and psychological divide — the home is in an area where prices often exceed $2 million, but the selling price was still a record high, Eviston said.
"It was the highest price per square foot ever achieved for an East Vancouver home," he said.
"We did some very significant marketing on that home. We did a lot of different things to get the buzz going on it."
The listing price attracted around eight interested buyers, Eviston said. That quickly dropped to three serious buyers when it became clear no one was going to secure the house at or near its asking price.
Eviston stands by his strategy on the property, and in the end, he said, it's the market that dictates price.
"We definitely felt that the value was somewhere between where we listed it and where we sold it," he said. "Pricing it where we did was a strategic position to take in the market, and [we felt] that the market would no doubt dictate what the value of the home was."
Brexit threatens £425 million in EU Peace programme grants to Northern Ireland BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A Brexit could threaten European grants worth almost £425 million to support peace in Northern Ireland. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/brexit-threatens-425-million-in-eu-peace-programme-grants-to-northern-ireland-34474920.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/news-analysis/article34474957.ece/4d26d/AUTOCROP/h342/COM_20140326_OPI_024_31117637_I3.JPG

A Brexit could threaten European grants worth almost £425 million to support peace in Northern Ireland.
The money would improve the lives of children and young people and help victims and survivors deal with the legacy of the Troubles under plans announced last month.
The EU has worked for years to promote cohesion between Catholics and Protestants as well as economic stability, according to the European Parliament.
A European Parliament statement said: "The EU Peace programme is now seen as an example of peace-building policy to be shared throughout Europe and other regions."
Europe has paid £1.3 billion euro since 1995 to support peace in Northern Ireland and the border counties in the Republic of Ireland through PEACE and Interreg programmes.
It has helped build a peace bridge linking mainly Catholic and Protestant communities in Londonderry and the Skainos Centre in East Belfast.
The latest pot of money, £424 million from Europe, was announced last month and applications have already begun. The programme is due to end in 2020.
The money is coming from the EU's PEACE IV and Interreg programmes and a key plank of the strategy is protecting young people through skills development for anyone up to 24.
It is hoped it can be used to support youths who fall out of education and training programmes and are at risk of anti-social behaviour or lives of crime and violence.

The entire grant package will be used to fund projects in Northern Ireland, the border region and parts of western Scotland.
However, Eurosceptics argue that UK taxpayers get back less than half the amount they "pour into Brussels" in grants and rebate.
Former MEP Jim Allister leads the Traditional Unionist Voice, a small party with one seat in the devolved Assembly.
He claimed membership of the EU cost the UK over £1 million an hour.
"There is the nonsense spun about Northern Ireland being unable to survive without EU handouts. Not only is it our own money we are getting back, but even we are net contributors.
"Prosperity and growth, along with the dignity of standing on our own feet and making our own decisions, await us outside the EU. Why are we waiting?"
As the only part of the UK to share a land border of 300 miles with another EU member state, the Republic of Ireland, Brexit could have particular implications for Northern Ireland.
Irish premier Enda Kenny has claimed Britain leaving the EU could throw Northern Ireland's peace process into turmoil while several high profile figures have raised the prospect of security checks at the border.
Ian Paisley MP, son of former DUP leader Ian Paisley, has argued that it is already heavily policed via surveillance cameras and little would change through Brexit. The DUP has confirmed it will campaign for an exit.

Leopards on the loose, a planet inferno, and will fast food giants spark a Domino's effect for climate change?
Peru - Peruvian peatlands are of huge environmental importance, not only locally but also globally. They not only house enormous stores of carbon, but are home to diverse flora and fauna, and provide essential ecosystems services that support local livelihoods.
Located in Amazonia, the Pastaza Marañon Basin stores an amount of carbon in peat soil equivalent to more than 100 years of the country´s anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG).
However, most of this carbon has only been partially protected and now, Peruvian peatlands are showing clear signs of degradation. At this vital crossroad, these peatlands can either become part of the problem, or the solution in the global battle against climate change. This depends greatly on the country's actions towards their sustainable management.
Kristell Hergoualc'h, a scientist at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), has been studying Peruvian peatlands as part of CIFOR's Sustainable Wetlands Adaptation and Mitigation Program (SWAMP).
Based in Peru, Hergoualc'h was part of a team of scientists who recently published a pilot study that was the first one to attempt to map and characterize the degradation of palm swamp peatlands in the Peruvian Amazon. The study combined remote sensing data and carbon in biomass from inventories.
“Providing solid and credible estimations of the impacts of degradation is an essential step in planning and adopting conservation strategies,” says Hergoualc'h.
“Peruvian peatlands should be considered as priorities in any national conservation program for climate change mitigation.”
Forests News sat down with Hergoualc'h to discuss the study's results and the pressing need for the country to develop strategies and policies that ensure their sustainable management.

What are peatlands and why are they important, particularly in the context of Peru?
Peatlands are wetland ecosystems located in depressions that remain flooded during most of the year. The continued oxygen-poor conditions in the soil lead to a slow decomposition of the dead branches, leaves and roots and result, over thousands of years, in the accumulation of a soil layer extremely rich in carbon.
This layer can be very deep. For example, in Peru, peat deposits with a depth up to nine meters were found in the Amazon basin. Peatlands are therefore very important in terms of carbon storage and cycling. Peru holds a substantial area of peatlands, most of which is located in the Amazon basin, but there are also peatlands in the Andes. Lowland peatlands are mostly forests hosting a high density of Mauritia flexuosa palms – locally known as aguajes.
What is causing the current degradation of Peruvian peatlands?
There are different types of activities causing peatland degradation, such as peat extraction in the Andes or illegal gold mining in the region of Madre de Dios. We've been looking more specifically at the degradation of the palm-dominated forests that spans the entire Amazonian basin.
People consume the fruit of the aguaje palm and a weevil – called suri– that develops inside the dead trunk of the palms. These products are important sources of vitamins and proteins, especially for rural communities. Unfortunately, the harvest of the fruit has not been very sustainable. It has been extensively cultivated in the past decades by cutting down the entire palm instead of climbing it.
What are some of the conclusions of your recent study into the drivers of Peruvian peatland degradation?
We've been working in an area of about 350,000 hectares in the region of Loreto and combined data obtained by remote sensing and data collected on the ground to evaluate the extent of degradation and the impact of degradation on the structure and composition of the forest.
We found that 73 percent of the area of palm swamp forest on peat was degraded. Our results suggest that degradation induces a shift in forest composition; the forest becomes dominated by woody trees instead of palms.
We also found that degradation translates into significant reductions in tree carbon stocks with initial stocks decreased by 11 percent and 17 percent following medium and high degradation.
This was the week Donald Trump finally told us his secret plan to defeat ISIS.
During his big foreign policy speech on Monday, Trump claimed his was “an opponent of the Iraq War, from the beginning.” But as The Daily Show — and anyone with Google — was able to discover, that's not exactly true.
In fact, correspondent Desi Lydic was even more blunt. “That's a lie,” she said in her fact-checking segment Tuesday night. “To the extent that Donald Trump cared about Iraq in the beginning, he supported the war.”
Cut to that infamous Howard Stern interview from 2002 in which he answered a question from the host about whether he was for invading Iraq with the line, “Yeah, I guess so.”
“That's right,” Lydic said, “Trump was asked if he was for invading Iraq and he replied, ‘Yeah, I guess so,' which, incidentally is also Trump's go-to wedding vow.” Lydic deemed Trump's latest statement about Trump opposing Iraq “false,” noting that it has been “debunked over and over.”
“Trump seems to think we can't easily find this stuff on the internet,” she added. “So I give this claim one hotel porn channel.”
But it was Trump's new “extreme vetting” policy proposal that caught the attention of host Trevor Noah. “I'm sorry, Donald Trump is the biggest joke. It's like he's auditioning for the extreme vetting commercial,” he said, imitating the way Trump repeated the phrase over and over again as if he didn't realize his speech was live.”
And what does “extreme vetting” actually look like? The Daily Show gave us a glimpse of the type of questions certain Americans can expect the next time they try to enter the country.
Questions like, “Fuck, marry, kill: Statue of Liberty, Osama bin Laden, and Melania Trump.”
UPDATED: Norwegian animal protection authorities called for help from police when they raided a fur farm at Klepp in Rogaland on the west coast Tuesday. State broadcaster NRK reported the raid came after the authorities had received information about animals in “terrible” condition. The owner of the mink farm now faces charges of gross negligence and exclusion from the fur industry's own organization that fights to keep the controversial fur business alive. He later apologized.
“I'm very sorry about this, it shouldn't have happened,” fur farmer Ingvar Kjell Bjorland told NRK after scores of his animals had to be put to sleep to relieve their suffering. Bjorland admitted he had lost control over his mink farming operation.
Officials at state food and animal safety agency Mattilsynet had confirmed Tuesday afternoon that they were in the process of carrying out an “unannounced inspection” at the fur farm. “During the operation they needed and asked for help from police,” Hege Robberstad of Mattilsynet told NRK, because the extent of violations they found was so large.
‘Illness and injuries'
Ole Aamodt, a section chief at Mattilsynet, said the violations involved “illness and injuries involving a large number of animals.” Mattilsynet reported later that many of the animals at the farm suffered “serious injuries and open sores.” The authorities said Bjorland, who reportedly has as many as 30,000 mink on his property, “didn't have enough cages” to properly house all the animals that needed medical treatment or to be protected from the other animals.
NRK reported that by Tuesday evening, authorities said the death toll at the fur farm had risen to 74 and was likely to keep rising. Bjorland told NRK that he had kept the sick and injured animals in a separate area. “Instead of killing them we had tried to treat them with disinfection spray or antibiotics, but some of the animals' sores were too serious and they should have been put down,” he admitted. He denied his failure to do so was economically motivated.
Mattilsynet regularly makes unannounced inspections of fur farms in Norway, and the government recently stepped up efforts to investigate and prosecute crimes against animals. In this case, Aamodt told NRK the inspectors had found “many violations of laws and regulations regarding how animals must be cared for, and we have asked police to help secure documentation and evidence.”
Owner downplayed maltreatment
NRK reported that it got in contact with Bjorland, the owner of the fur farm, while the inspection was underway and he initially downplayed the inspection. He did acknowledge, though, that the authorities had uncovered deficiencies in the treatment of sick animals.
A representative of the fur industry association Norges Pelsdyralslag was dispatched to the farm at Klepp. “We want to find out what's going on,” said the association's information chief Guri Wormdahl. She later wrote in a press release that the bad treatment of the animals had been confirmed, and the extent of it forced the organization to conclude that this was a case of gross negligence.
“In such a case, we can't rule out that our board must evaluate the strongest sanctions (against the farmer), such as revoking the farmer's production certificate and exclusion from our organization,” Wormdahl wrote. Bjorland told NRK, meanwhile, that he was trying to “clean up” his fur operation, indicating he wanted to remain in business. He had just recently expanded, building two new barns to house the mink.
The case can only be a major blow to the association, which often is on the defensive in Norwegian media after repeated incidents of poor treatment of animals at fur farms in Norway. The association lobbies hard to keep the fur farms in business and claimed Tuesday night that it also gets upset when animals are poorly treated. “It upsets the entire organization,” Wormdahl claimed, citing a need for “good animal welfare.”
Several Members of Parliament want to phase out the industry after promises to improve conditions fail to be fulfilled. Iselin Nybø of the Liberal Party told NRK she and her colleagues were “disappointed that people can treat animals in this manner. We have long been clear that we want to phase out fur farming. We don't think wild animals should be kept in cages.”
She said the Liberals would put forward a proposal that fur farmers receive state funding to cease fur farming and go into new lines of business.

I've tried many attempts at VR locomotion, including a hamster cage and a bizarre contraption involving several bungie cords. Omni's method is simpler. You walk in place on a solid object, and that motion is translated to in-game movement.
But right now, Omni isn't Omni yet. It's just a wooden prototype. The shipping product will have accelerometers and magnets in clip-ons for any shoe, which will track each step individually, in multiple directions. For now, Omni's shoes and platform are "dumb," and instead a Kinect tracks your steps. All this hardware, all this technology, all this beautiful experimentation, results in one thing: you're simulating the press of a "W" button to walk forward. If you swipe your feet speedily across the Omni surface, the Kinect software detects your flailing and holds the "shift" button in addition to the "W" button, and you can sprint across the game world. You can't go backwards, you can't turn, you can't crouch… you're basically just the world's most convoluted "W" button. The Virtuix guys tested the setup by simply opening a Notepad and typing.
Omni's current demo of choice is the Half-Life 2 beta that's been configured to work with the Oculus VR goggles. When the level was loaded, I squinted through the low-res display and swung my head around to test its responsiveness. The motion of the plastic gun in my hand wasn't reflected in the game world: the only way I could aim was by tilting my head. That frustrated me. And now I was locked in a cage, in a diaper, with no way to proceed in-game other than tricking a Kinect sensor into pressing the W key.
I was locked in a cage, in a diaper
But I quickly forgot about those Ws. Instead, I just started walking. This particular Omni was configured for someone shorter than me, so I had to slump down a bit for my diaper to get support from the ring. Sometimes I felt really stupid, like my legs were all wrong, but then my character would start to move, I would start to "get" it, and then the bad guys invaded and I shot them and they died. And then I got stuck on a corner, or out in the open, or hovering above a grenade, and I died.
Like many people, I've found the Oculus Rift is best experienced in slow, combat-free ways. It's about exploration and discovery. Finally, you can stand and look at your surroundings with your natural head movements, fueled by your natural curiosity. But there was no time for any of that. The bad guys were coming, and I was on an Omni, and so I ran.
Even though Virtuix warned me it was a typical response, the first time a grenade was chucked at my feet I booked it. But I couldn't run backwards, or sideways, so I didn't get far away from the grenade before it detonated. The fear of a grenade at your feet is somehow primal. Because you can't see your body while using the Oculus, but you're using your body because of the Omni, it's like you're floating in a murky lake. Then you're gripped with the sudden fear that Something's In the Water, and it's probably a piranha.
I constantly got hung up on sharp corners. I'd bump into an object and get stuck, unable to sidestep it. It was explained to me later that the only method of turning my character was by turning my head with the Oculus. My walking had nothing to do with it. I mean, I knew that, but my body didn't know that. In fact, I don't know if my body could ever learn that. VR has a weird learning curve: the more it's like real life, the more difficult it is to operate the aspects that aren't.
The more it's like real life, the more difficult it is to operate the aspects that aren't
After a while, the Virtuix guys decided, because of my height, I should try to use the Omni without the harness. Despite the more natural posture it was much more difficult, as I braced myself with one hand and held my gun in the other. With so much concentration spent just trying to walk forward, I didn't mind so much that my neck was the cursor. In fact, it was a bit of a relief.
The real test will be when Omni is in more than its current hacky incarnation. Virtuix hopes to ship the device in early 2014, and is currently gearing up its final design for manufacture. The device will be rapidly adjustable, collapsible, smaller, vastly more responsive (allowing the ability to turn, strafe, do analog speed control, and maybe even perform backwards locomotion), and surprisingly cheap: retail versions should go for somewhere between $499 and $599, and early Kickstarter backers will get one for much cheaper. Add in an Oculus Rift and a fake gun and you're still probably under $1,000 for the whole setup. This is revolutionary for VR. It'll be even more revolutionary if it really works; if it's more than a W key.
At one point I spoke out loud about what was happening in the game, and received no response in the room, IRL. I spoke again, nothing. I felt like if nobody spoke the third time, I could be stuck forever in the game world. And then my buddy Trent yelled off to the right: "Save me! I'm over here!" I know Trent's voice, I know he's not a Half-Life character. I smiled. But I still ran toward him in the game. I could've sworn I'd find a ghost of him behind the tanker car. The worst part of virtual reality, and I had never considered this before that moment, might be being the only human in a 3D land.
Is there anything better than coming home from work on a Friday to a gift at the door? :D
I came home today to find Sandman Vol. 7 had arrived for me! This is SUPER exciting - I've been slowly collecting all of the series through reddit users (gift exchanges, swaps, etc.) and rereading them as they come. Vol. 7, "Brief Lives," is my favorite of the series - after I opened it, I flipped through it in awe again. I cannot WAIT to reread it this weekend! Now, I'm one step closer to completing the series!
Thanks so much, gifter! I read your note, and it's always exciting to get matched with someone with similar interests. Thank you so much for your gift - on a scale of 1/10, I'm clocking in at ABSOLUTELY THRILLED! (That's a 10). I hope you get as great a gift in return!
President Trump blasted Chelsea Manning in an early morning tweet Thursday, calling the convicted Army leaker an “ungrateful TRAITOR” who he said should “never have been released from prison.”
The president also charged that Manning had called former President Obama a “weak leader,” though the transgender soldier -- whose prison commutation was one of Mr. Obama's last acts in the Oval Office -- didn't exactly say that.
Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader. Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017
Mr. Trump seemed to be referring to an op-ed Manning wrote in The Guardian on Wednesday, which called for an “unapologetic progressive” to lead the country, following the former president's “vulnerable” legacy.
“Optimism and hope would be met with backlash and hate,” Manning wrote of Obama's time in office. “He faced unparalleled resistance from his opponents, many of whom wanted him to fail.”
The lesson to be learned, Manning said, was “do not start off with a compromise.”
“They won't meet you in the middle,” she wrote. “Instead, what we need is an unapologetic progressive leader.”
Manning had previously expressed gratitude to the former president after news that her 35-year prison sentence would be commuted by Obama.
In a tweet last week, Manning thanked Obama “for giving me a chance.”
Thank you @BarackObama for giving me a chance. =,) — Chelsea Manning (@xychelsea) January 19, 2017
It's unclear what prompted Mr. Trump's early Thursday tweet lambasting the former soldier, who had been convicted of leaking classified military and State Department documents and videos to the infodumping website WikiLeaks. (Mr. Trump has himself been critical of leaks of government information but has also encouraged WikiLeaks after the site released private email correspondences from his rival Hillary Clinton's campaign staff.)
The president's short Twitter message came shortly after a Fox News panel discussion aired on the topic, where a commentator described Obama “as a weak leader with few permanent accomplishments.”
CNN's Brian Stelter pointed to the timing of the Fox News segment and Mr. Trump's tweet:
14 minutes apart: Fox says "ungrateful traitor," Trump says "ungrateful traitor," Fox says "weak leader," Trump says "weak leader." pic.twitter.com/f7urTOUG1L — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 26, 2017
Manning is expected to be freed in May of 2017.
Republicans in Congress are waiting with bated breath for the moment when they pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act in 2017 and President-elect Donald Trump goes to sign it, but it's their colleagues back in their home states that may have the most to lose from scrapping the law.
The repeal plans congressional Republicans have floated wouldn't likely take effect until 2019 or 2020. But already, governors and state legislatures are voicing concerns that repealing the ACA may leave millions of people uninsured, as well as take away some of the mechanisms that helped their states drastically slash their uninsured rates.
At the top of their list of concerns is the fact that the most likely blueprint in Congress for repeal, a 2015 bill that President Barack Obama vetoed, would also repeal federal funding for Medicaid expansion, which was estimated to have helped cover 11 million adults across the country in 2015. Ten Republican governors have taken advantage of the expansion, which was so successful in some places like Kentucky that, even though Gov. Matt Bevin (R) campaigned on scrapping the ACA, he simply made some tweaks to the program once he took office.
The Congressional repeal plan from 2015 would also repeal tax increases that were part of the ACA, likely shifting the burden for paying for health care from the federal government to individual states.
“Without that money, there is no way states could keep covering the 20 million people who have been covered under Obamacare,” Larry Levitt, vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told TPM.
“It is looking like pressure is going to shift back to the states but potentially without the financial resources to really make it work,” he added.
On Tuesday, Montana's Republican House speaker, Austin Knudsen, warned that repeal could make it harder for Montana, which only voted to expand Medicaid in 2015, to pay for the program. He said that the state either was going to have to try to come up with some kind of solution, or else hope that Congress comes up with a fix itself.
“You're going to tell me that we're going to put 100,000 people on the Medicaid rolls and then when the federal government takes the money away we're just going to jerk the rug out from under them? I don't see that as being a realistic answer,” Knudsen told the Billings Gazette. “The state of Montana is going to have to look at trying to help keep those people covered. Whether I like the bill or not, it passed. It was signed into law. We covered a whole bunch more people.”
Red states across the country may face the harshest outcome if Obamacare is repealed early next year. The Los Angeles Times noted earlier this month that four of the five states whose residents receive the most in subsidies to help them buy insurance have Republican-controlled congressional delegations: Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia. The 2015 Congressional repeal bill, however, would scrap the very same subsidies that help low-income people afford insurance.
A report from the Wall Street Journal also noted that the highest drops in the uninsured rate came in counties that Trump carried, where unemployment is higher and median incomes are lower than the national average. That suggests that when Obamacare is repealed, the very voters who supported Trump will likely suffer the most.
Yet it's not state-level Republicans railing the hardest against repeal—it is, of course, the Democrats.
Last week the Democratic Governor's Association sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) arguing that repealing the ACA would result in states being saddled with an additional $69 billion in uncompensated health care costs for residents and could result in millions losing their insurance.
“Repeal would throw millions of our residents off their health coverage, shift enormous costs to state governments – blowing a hole in state budgets – and cause economic uncertainty for our states' businesses, hospitals, and patients. This plan appears to be nothing more than a Washington, D.C. bait-and-switch that puts an untenable burden on the states,” read the letter, which was signed by Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.
In Montana, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock sent his own letter to Republican leaders in Congress urging them not to repeal ACA unless they have a replacement bill ready to go.
“Congress should not rip healthcare away from tens of thousands of Montanans and millions of Americans without first presenting a real and viable alternative that protects patients and provides a foundation for states, healthcare providers, and insurers to responsibly plan for the future,” Bullock wrote, according to a report from the Flathead Beacon.
In New Mexico, the state health care exchange had even drafted an unofficial letter from its Republican governor, Suzana Martinez, warning against Obamacare repeal. It turned out that the governor's office never even saw the letter and had never signed off on the opinions contained in it. The bizarre episode laid bare the tension that exists as Republican leaders prepare to finally make good on a campaign promise that may adversely affect their state.
“Repeal may be attractive to Republican candidates, but when the reality sinks in about who is going to win and lose, it becomes a much harder proposition,” Levitt said.
Facebook is liberating a large collection of libraries that it uses internally for C++ development. The code is available from a public GitHub repository where it is distributed as open source under the permissive Apache Software License.
The assortment of frameworks is collectively called Folly, the Facebook Open Source Library. Its individual components support a diverse spectrum of capabilities, ranging from general-purpose programming functionality to more specialized pieces that are designed to help developers wring extra performance out of complex applications.
Among many other things, the Folly libraries simplify concurrency, string formatting, JSON manipulation, benchmarking, and iterating over collections. They also offer optimized drop-in replacements for several C++ standard library classes, including std::string .
As I learned when I visited Facebook's headquarters earlier this year, open source software is an important part of Facebook's infrastructure and development culture. The company contributes to a number of major projects such as Hadoop and memcached. It has also released some key pieces of its internal software stack, such as the Cassandra database server and Thrift RPC framework.
When Facebook wants to open a piece of software that has developed internally, the company must first isolate the component so that it can be used by third parties without depending on other proprietary Facebook code. The challenge of disentangling pieces of infrastructure for standalone consumption is an obstacle that hinders Facebook's efforts to open more of its stack.
Releasing the company's internal C++ libraries will make it easier to share additional software that depends on this code. Although the desire to get some critical Facebook dependencies out in the open is the primary motivation, the Folly code itself is also likely going to be useful for a number of C++ developers.
When Bartolo Colon jogged in from the bullpen to replace Noah Syndergaard on Saturday night in Game 2 of the NLDS between the Dodgers and Mets, we thought we were going to be talking about the wisdom of using a pitch-to-contact starter in relief when a strikeout was the preferred outcome. But then Howie Kendrick hit a line drive up the middle, which second baseman Daniel Murphy fielded and flipped to shortstop Ruben Tejada in an effort to turn an inning-ending double play. And then this happened.
Your browser does not support iframes.
There's no real way to describe this play in any other way than this: Chase Utley, realizing his role shifted from baserunner to defender, barreled into Tejada with the intention of preventing him from throwing the ball to first base. To do this, Utley waited until the last possible moment to slide, not even attempting to touch the base as his body upended Tejada, whose legs were taken out from under him, causing him to land violently on the ground. The collision forced Tejada to be removed from the game.
Article continues below ...
Then, even more inexplicably, while medical staff was tending to Tejada on the field, the play was challenged and reviewed by MLB, which decided that Tejada's foot did not touch second base. Utley was awarded second base, overturning the original force-out call. Which, OK, Tejada's foot did not touch second base, but no part of Utley ever touched the base either. He ran down the baseline, deliberately threw his body into an opponent, was called out, jogged off the field and took a position on the bench. The first time he touched second base in that entire inning was when MLB told him to go back out there as a baserunner, a position he had already abdicated of his own volition.
I don't want to lay too much blame on the umpiring crew, or even the replay officials who then put Utley back on second base because Tejada barely missed touching second base on accident after Utley intentionally didn't touch second base. This play happened because MLB has, for a very long time, allowed plays like this to happen. There's a rule in the rulebook — 6.01(6), if you're wondering — that explicitly gives the power to the umpires to call both the runner and the batter out on plays like this. It says the following.
"If, in the judgment of the umpire, a base runner willfully and deliberately interferes with a batted ball or a fielder in the act of fielding a batted ball with the obvious intent to break up a double play, the ball is dead. The umpire shall call the runner out for interference and also call out the batter-runner because of the action of his teammate. In no event may bases be run or runs scored because of such action by a runner."
There can be no question that the intent of Utley's slide was to break up the double play, but this rule is never enforced and effectively doesn't exist. In the culture of Major League Baseball, this play is acceptable, because people have been sliding into middle infielders for years, and it's part of the game.
Well, running over catchers at home plate was part of the game, too, until MLB eventually realized it didn't want it to be part of the game. MLB explicitly told players to stop running over catchers. And you know what? I haven't heard one single person complain that they missed catchers getting run over this year. The game has gone on and been as entertaining as ever without that part, and MLB will be just fine without continuing to endanger middle infielders in the future.
Tejada suffered a fractured fibula on the play, by the way, ending his season. Even if that weren't true, this type of play still should be outlawed post-haste by MLB. But it often takes an ugly example of the harm a bad rule can do before it gets changed, and in this case, Tejada's leg was sacrificed in the process. So let's not let it be in vain. Either enforce the rule on the books or make a new one explicitly stating that baserunners have to try to advance safely from one base to the next and at no point are they allowed to switch into linebacker mode in order to prohibit defenders from doing their jobs.
It's time for a change. Ruben Tejada might not be as prominent a player as Buster Posey, but hopefully his injury paves the way to a rule protecting middle infielders just as Posey's injury did for catchers.
The intersection of food and fuel chemistry – #foodchem carnival
CENtral science are hosting a blog carnival from November 11-18 about food chemistry, #foodchem. As a non-US chemist, the Thanksgiving theme of the #foodchem carnival is not all that relevant to me, so I haven't followed the questions and am instead writing about something which I find interesting – an intersecting area of food and fuel chemistry.
At first glance, it might appear that foods and fuels could be almost as far apart as you can get in the world of applied chemistry, but as this Harris cartoon (third one down, right hand column) suggests, there are actually some interesting parallels.
Several years ago, I worked for a government organisation where I completed a significant project assessing the levels of trans fats in a range of supermarket foods. The fat content of the foods was profiled, down to the amounts and types of fats present (saturated, mono-, poly-unsaturated, and of the unsaturates, cis and trans isomers). This also allowed the checking of whether the labelling was correct, in the cases where fat levels were reported by the manufacturer either voluntarily or as required.
In order to determine the amounts and types of fats present, it must first be extracted, or separated from the rest of the ingredients in the food. Often, especially with porous foodstuffs like cakes, breads and biscuits, the fat can be easily recovered from the food by simply mixing with hexane or heptane, which easily dissolve fats. More difficult matrices such as chocolate, emulsified sauces and tinned meats required more exhaustive and technical extraction procedures.
The fat is isolated from the food still chemically intact, in the form of a triglyceride (see below). As the name suggests, it consists of a trio of fatty acids (in blue), linked together by glycerol (in pink). In this example, all of the fatty acids in the triglyceride are the same, but this doesn't have to be the case. There can be a mixture of lengths, and varying degrees of saturation. For this reason, it is necessary to break apart the triglyceride into the separate fatty acids for analysis. This is done by performing a very simple chemical reaction called transesterification, and here is the where the link with fuels is revealed. Transesterification of oils and fats is the exact same reaction that is used to produce ‘biodiesel', which is also known as FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) or ‘first generation alternate fuel' within the fuel industry.
It is clear that biodiesel can be easily made from fats and oils sourced from virtually anywhere, and for commercial production, ideally these should be non-food sources. Backyard biodiesel production is also not uncommon, and for many people with a connection to a restaurant or café producing waste oil, can be a cheap and sustainable way to run a forgiving, diesel-fuelled vehicle. This of course, should only be done with the correct equipment, PPE and sufficient knowledge to carry out the procedure safely.
In my lab, we have produced some small quantities of biodiesel from high fat foods, as part of an undergraduate student project and also a science outreach opportunity as we use the samples in our lab tours.
% total fat by weight Amount biodiesel produced 1×McDonald's double quarter pounder burger 17 ~50 mL 1×McDonald's large fries 19 ~25 mL 12×Krispy Kreme doughnuts 25 ~100 mL 1 pack (13) Scotch finger biscuits 21 ~20 mL
As you can see, this is far from an economical or efficient way to produce fuel (a dozen doughnuts wouldn't even get you a kilometre down the road), but it is a great experiment for students to do to develop their wet chemistry techniques, and also think about the structures of common molecules. So next time you indulge in some fatty food, think about how with a quick chemical reaction you could convert your human fuel into fuel for your car or truck. Nifty!
Politics in Russia is normally tightly scripted by the Kremlin, but every once in a while a bit of reality shines through.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev got a dose of that kind of reality during a May 23 visit to the Ukrainian region of Crimea, which was forcibly seized by Russia in 2014.
A video widely shared on social media (above) shows Medvedev being pummeled by relentless questions from irate locals who say their Russian pensions have not been indexed to the rising cost of living.
Initially, Medvedev tries to wave off the interrogation by saying “pensions are a separate topic,” but an angry woman off camera refuses to let him off the hook.
“They are wiping their feet on us,” she shouts, saying that her pension of 8,000 rubles ($120) is “nothing.”
After enduring a bit more haranguing, Medvedev concedes that no one in Russia has had their pensions adjusted for inflation yet for a very simple reason: “There just isn't any money now. When we find money, we'll make the adjustment.”
He then beats a hasty retreat, shouting over his dissatisfied interlocutor: “You hang in there. Best wishes! Cheers! Take care!”
And to underscore his “tomorrow, tomorrow, the sun will come out tomorrow” theme, a few hours later Medvedev posted to his Instagram account a lovely photograph of a Crimean rainbow.
When Russia was preparing the ground for the Black Sea peninsula's annexation, Moscow promised dramatic increases in pensions and salaries for state-sector workers. And the Kremlin has delivered to some extent, bringing those payments in line with those across the rest of Russia.
However, the country's economy has been sorely hit by a combination of low global energy prices and the effects of international sanctions (and Russian countersanctions) over Russia's actions in Ukraine. Inflation has also been high in Crimea since Kyiv banned trade between the occupied region and the rest of the country last year. Russia is building a bridge between Crimea and Russia, but it will not be completed until late 2018 at the earliest.
Medvedev's awkward exchange with the disappointed Crimean pensioner quickly became the stuff of memes on social media. In one angry one, he is shown making a rude gesture over the caption: “Dear Crimeans. There is no money and there isn't going to be any soon. But you hang in there. Take care!”
In another, he is shown praying before an Orthodox icon that says to him plainly: “There is no money!”
And a third transforms Medvedev's words into an election slogan for the ruling United Russia party -- which the prime minister heads -- and its campaign for the September State Duma elections: “There is no money. But you hang in there!”

Donald Trump should prepare for the “UK's biggest ever protest” if he visits Birmingham, campaigners said today.
It was reported this morning that Trump's state visit - expected to take place in July or August - could be shifted from London to the Midlands to make it “easier to police.”
And it's been claimed the government could arrange a stadium rally for the President.
But politicians and activists say President Trump should expect a frosty reception if he turns up in Brum.

Shabana Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, said: “Birmingham is a wonderfully diverse city, home to people of every background, every faith - President Trump with his hateful and divisive rhetoric, policies and Muslim ban is not welcome here."
Trump's Muslim ban has already sparked some of the most well attended and furious UK protests in recent years.

Dozens of protests took place in towns and cities across Britain, drawing crowds in their thousands in London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle, Manchester, Brighton, Birmingham and Leeds.
And another rally is planned for February 20th outside Parliament as part of a nationwide day of action.
But Writer Owen Jones, who co-founded the Stop Trump Coalition, said rallies against a Trump visit to the Midlands could be even bigger.

He said: “Donald Trump's state visit will be marked by the biggest protest against racism and hatred in our country's history. It doesn't matter where he goes. We will march in our millions against him, and our government's collusion, in every town and city in Britain.”
Birmingham Campaigner Salma Yaqoob said: "If Donald Trump comes to the great city of Birmingham, our diverse communities will take to the streets in our thousands - and show him what we think about his misogyny, racism, and Islamophobia."
An MTA bus driver allegedly choked a passenger in Brooklyn after the two got into a dispute about the passenger bringing a dog on board, police say. Ida Siegal reports. (Published Thursday, April 9, 2015)
An MTA bus driver allegedly choked a passenger in Brooklyn after the two got into a dispute about the passenger bringing a dog on board, police say.
The passenger, Giovanny Michaga, tried to board the B6 at Bath Avenue and Bay Parkway in Bath Beach Wednesday morning with his Maltese, according to his sister Rosa Michaga.
The driver refused, and the two got into an argument. The driver allegedly grabbed Giovanny Michaga's throat, and other passengers stepped in to break up the fight, police said.
"Who tries to strangle anybody for bringing a dog on the bus?" said Rosa Michaga. "That's crazy. It's unbelievable, actually."
Rosa said Minnie was in her carrying case when Giovanny tried to take her on the bus.
"She was in her bag. What harm could she do to anybody?" said Rosa, who spoke on behalf of her brother, who wasn't home Wednesday night.
According to rules posted on the MTA's website, animals are not allowed on the bus unless it's a service dog or "unless enclosed in a container and carried in a manner which would not annoy other passengers."
Whether Minnie's carrying case qualified is unclear: Minnie could obviously stick her head out of the bag, and the bus driver apparently didn't think she should be on the bus.
The 49-year-old driver has been charged with criminal obstruction of breathing and unlawful imprisonment.
The MTA has not commented on the arrest of the driver, who has been with the agency since 1999. A message was also left with the bus drivers union.
Happy Danny-versary, everyone! Six years ago today, Danny Rose scored against Arsenal. Yes, THAT goal against Arsenal on his Tottenham Hotspur debut. The one we still talk about, and the one that no matter how good he is and how long his career he will almost certainly never equal.
That goal. Let's celebrate it as a fan base. Everybody together now:
OHHHHHHHHWHATTAGOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLLLL
IT'S DANNY ROSE ON HIS PREMIER LEAGUE DEBUT WITH A MEMORABLE STRIKE
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT
But it gets better, people! Because today isn't just the anniversary of Danny Rose's goal against the Gooners. Today is also the TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY of Paul Gascoigne's incredible free kick against Arsenal in the fifth minute that led to a 3-1 Spurs victory in the 1991 FA Cup semifinal. Spurs went on to lift the FA Cup trophy with a win over Nottingham Forest.
Again, all together:
IS GASCOIGNE GOING TO HAVE A CRACK? HE IS YOU KNOW
OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH I SAY
BRILLIANT
THAT... IS... SCHOOLBOY'S OWN STUFF
This is an important day. Celebrate it with a loved one, a nice bottle of white wine (#neverred), and a framed photo of Dele Alli & Eric Dier.
Pope's astronomer would be pleased to baptize an alien "no matter how many tentacles it has"
Guy Consolmagno, astronomer to the pope, is profiled in the Economist. He says intelligent design is "bad theology" that has been "hijacked" by American creationist fundamentalists. He also would be "delighted" to discover intelligent extraterrestrial life.
Consolmagno curates the pope's meteorite collection and is a trained astronomer and planetary scientist at the Vatican's observatory. He dismissed the ideas of intelligent design – a pseudoscientific version of creationism. "The word has been hijacked by a narrow group of creationist fundamentalists in America to mean something it didn't originally mean at all. It's another form of the God of the gaps. It's bad theology in that it turns God once again into the pagan god of thunder and lightning."
(Hey, you guys won against the pagans centuries ago. Why kick them when they're down?)

(Reuters) - Ahead of a presidential election widely considered a referendum on President Barack Obama's job creation efforts, all but two states reported improving jobless rates in January from a year ago, with some swing states hitting the lowest rates in three years.

The Labor Department also said on Tuesday that 45 out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia had drops in their jobless rates in January from December.
The improvements encompassed all swing states where neither President Barack Obama nor his future Republican opponent have a clear overwhelming majority.
Because of the unique U.S. electoral system where states cast votes for President, the employment situations of some areas could influence the presidential election more than others. Ten states in particular are considered toss-ups representing 130 electoral votes. A candidate must collect 270 electoral votes to win.
Coming into office at the height of the financial crisis, Obama quickly bailed out banks and automobile companies and enacted a package of spending and tax measures intended to create thousands of jobs.
Only recently has the national unemployment rate edged down, however, reaching a three-year low of 8.3 percent in February and January. In January, 35 states fell to that rate or lower.
Of the 10 swing states, only three had rates higher than the national one. The rate in Nevada was 12.7 percent. In North Carolina it was 10.2 percent and in Florida 9.6 percent.
The fight over job creation could be particularly tough in Nevada, which flourished during the housing boom, leaving it vulnerable to the real estate collapse. The recession also kept many Americans away from entertainment cities Las Vegas and Reno. Nevada has had the highest unemployment rate in the nation for at least a year and a half.
Still, its January rate was the lowest since September 2008 and well below the state's record high of 14 percent reached in October 2010, nearly two years after Obama won the election.
Over the three years Obama has been in office, North Carolina and Florida also hit record high jobless rates, both reaching 11.4 percent two years ago. But in January 2012, North Carolina's rate was the lowest since April 2009 and Florida's the lowest since March 2009.
In Colorado, another swing state, the jobless rate climbed to a record 9 percent at the end of 2010. By January, it had fallen to 7.8 percent, the lowest since March 2009.
Swing state Iowa's rate of 5.4 percent in January was the lowest since December 2008, as was Missouri's 7.5 percent. New Hampshire's January rate of 5.2 percent and Virginia's 5.8 percent were the lowest since January 2009.
Ohio, a swing state that proved crucial to President George W. Bush's win in 2004, registered its lowest rate since November 2008, 7.7 percent. After Texas and New York, the manufacturing-heavy state also added the most jobs in the month, 32,800.
Even though its unemployment rate fell in January, Florida lost the most jobs of all the states that month, 38,600. Pennsylvania, another swing state, followed, shedding 9,000 jobs.
After the fight over which candidate won Florida in the 2000 presidential election went all the way to the Supreme Court, the country has closely watched the state's politics.
Its governor, Rick Scott, is a Republican who came to power as part of a wave of conservative anger that pushed Democrats out of office across the nation in 2010, but the state's 29 electoral votes, the most of any swing state's, are still considered up for grabs in 2012.
Four years ago, the story of how politics and economics connect was centered in one state: Michigan.
Throughout the 2008 primaries and general election, it had the highest jobless rate in the nation, as massive financial struggles at the three leading U.S. automobile companies took a heavy toll on factory jobs.
For the last year, the state has experienced a radical turnaround. According to its labor department, its January jobless rate of 8.9 percent was the lowest since September 2008 and marked the fourth straight month of an unemployment rate under 10 percent. The state gained 16,000 jobs in January.
“With the rate decline in January, Michigan's unemployment rate has fallen by around five full percentage points since the end of the national recession in mid-2009,” said Rick Waclawek, director of the Bureau of Labor Market Information and Strategic Initiatives.
The state and its 16 electoral votes are in play in the 2012 election, but currently are counted as leaning toward Obama.
In January, North Dakota again had the lowest jobless rate, 3.2 percent. Texas gained the most jobs, 67,200.
Among the 50 states, only New York's unemployment rate rose in January, to 8.3 percent from 8.2 percent in January 2011, while the rate in Illinois was the same as last year, 9.4 percent.

EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- The Vikings got back to work on Monday after a long weekend following their Thursday night win over the Washington Redskins. And as coach Leslie Frazier expected, several injured players were much closer to returning after the layoff.
Safety Jamarca Sanford and cornerback Chris Cook, who each missed the Vikings' last two games with a groin and hip strain, respectively, participated in the team's walk-through on Monday. So did tight end Rhett Ellison (ankle), running back Matt Asiata (shoulder), offensive guard Charlie Johnson (elbow) and defensive tackle Letroy Guion (chest/shoulder). Quarterback Christian Ponder, who had a dislocated shoulder on Thursday night, did a little work during the walk-through, though the Vikings will get a better sense of his health in practices on Wednesday and Thursday.
"You don't want to put him in harm's way, if he can't protect himself you wouldn't want to put him out there, so we'll have a better idea when we come back on Wednesday and start practicing," Frazier said. "He's made progress, which is encouraging. Now we have to see how much progress he makes in the next couple days and moving on to Thursday and Friday as well."
Right tackle Phil Loadholt, who sustained a concussion last Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys, is still going through the NFL's concussion testing protocol, Frazier said. Defensive tackle Fred Evans (knee) was still out of the team's walk-through. And tight end Kyle Rudolph, who fractured his left foot against Dallas, is off crutches and out of a walking boot, though he still expects to miss another 3-5 weeks.
"The biggest thing now is just still getting all the swelling out and letting the fracture heal," Rudolph said. "There is nothing we can do to speed it up.”
Bernie Sanders provided important context to the recent Democratic National Committee voter data scandal in the third Democratic presidential debate Saturday night.
Stressing points that the media has largely ignored, Sanders speculated that the Hillary Clinton campaign could have also accessed his campaign's data in the software breech — while his campaign was the one that was blamed. He furthermore indicated that similar errors have happened in the past, which his campaign quickly and honestly resolved and did not politicize in order to attack Clinton's campaign.

After an error occurred with the software the Democratic National Committee (DNC) uses for its voter data on Dec. 18, the Sanders campaign was accused of accessing the Clinton campaign's voter data.
The DNC subsequently cut off Sanders' access to the crucial voting database. Clinton's supporters blasted Sanders, and the media portrayed his campaign as dishonest. Many media reports, however, ignored significant details — namely that this isn't the first time such an error has happened, that the error lasted only around 30 minutes, and that the DNC violated its own rules by barring Sanders' campaign from the data.
Sanders' campaign promptly sued the DNC for violating its own rules. Sanders' lawsuit noted that "the loss of DNC support could significantly disadvantage, if not cripple, a Democratic candidate's campaign for public office." It also pointed out that the DNC's voter data agreement stipulated:
"Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event that the other party breaches this Agreement; the non-breaching party sends written notice to the breaching party describing the breach; and the breaching party does not cure the breach to the satisfaction of the non-breaching party within ten (10) calendar days following its receipt of such notice."
In other words, the DNC was not allowed to cut off Sanders' access without first sending a written notice to his campaign and waiting 10 days to see if it obliged to the demands. And yet the DNC blocked Sanders' campaign immediately.
This scandal, the way it was distorted in the media, and its timing just before the first primary vote in New Hampshire — where Sanders has been leading Clinton in the polls — caused Sanders' supporters to accuse the DNC of acting on behalf of Hillary Clinton. These suspicions were compounded by the fact that DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is an ally of Hillary Clinton.
Saturday, Sanders and the DNC reached a deal, granting his campaign access again to the crucial voter data.

The New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate began Saturday night with questions about this scandal.
Sanders replied noting that similar data errors have happened in the past at least twice, and that his campaign dealt with them responsibly -- and, unlike Clinton's campaign, did not try to turn them into a scandal.
"On two occasions, there were breeches in information two months ago. Our staff found information on our computers from the Clinton campaign. And when our staffers said, 'Whoa, what's going here?' They went to the DNC quietly. They went to the vendor and said, 'Hey, something is wrong,' and that was quietly dealt with. None of that information was looked at. Our staffer at that point did exactly the right thing," Sanders explained.
"A few days ago a similar incident happened. There was a breach because the DNC vendor screwed up, information came to our campaign. In this case, our staff did the wrong thing -- they looked at that information. As soon as we learned that they looked at that information, we fired that person. We are now doing an independent internal investigation to see who else was involved," he continued.

Sanders said he recognized that this was a "problem," and apologized to Clinton on behalf of his campaign. "But what the DNC did arbitrarily without discussing it with us is shut off our access to our information crippling our campaign. That is an egregious act," he insisted.
In a point completely looked over by the media, Sanders also pointed out that Clinton's campaign could have participated in the same wrongdoing of which his campaign was accused.
"I look forward to working with Secretary Clinton for an investigation, an independent investigation, about all of the breaches that have occurred from day one in this campaign, because I am not convinced that information from our campaign may not have ended up in her campaign," Sanders emphasized in the debate.

He called for "an independent investigation," and asked Clinton to do the same.
"When we saw the breach two months, we didn't go running to the media and make a big deal about it," Sanders added. "And it bothers me very much that, rather than working on this issue to resolve it, it has become many press releases from the Clinton campaign later."
Harry Reid has provoked outrage among liberals as well as conservatives, who seem to believe he has violated propriety by repeating gossip about Mitt Romney's taxes. The Senate leader says someone connected with Romney told him that the Republican candidate paid no income taxes for a period of ten years. Offended by Reid's audacity, commentators on the right have indicted him for “McCarthyism” while others on the left have accused him of inventing the whole story.
Evidently the chief complaint against Reid — aside from aggressiveness unbecoming a Democrat — is that he cited “an extremely credible source” who he has so far declined to name. Some journalists have gone so far as to suggest that Reid must be lying because he won't identify the source.
Despite all this righteous tut-tutting among the great and the good, in newspapers and magazines as well as on television, Reid's critics simply have no way of knowing whether he is telling the truth or not. From the beginning, Reid himself admitted forthrightly that he has no way of being absolutely certain whether what he was told is factual or not, although he believes the person who said it was being truthful.
Many of Reid's critics work for news outlets that rely on unnamed sources every day, of course, publishing assertions that range from the mundane to the outlandish. It is hard to see why an unnamed source quoted by a daily newspaper or a monthly magazine – or hidden behind a screen in a TV studio – is more credible than a person whispering in the ear of a United States Senator.
Indeed, several of the news outlets now barking at Reid have suffered their own episodes of scandalous embarrassment due to the exposure of invented sources and quotes (see Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass, etc. etc. etc.). Yet they nevertheless continue to publish quotes from such unnamed individuals. After all, where else would Reid have learned that this is acceptable conduct?

Two Complete Science-Adventure Books in 1953. The novella "Sargasso of Lost Cities", Blish's third "Cities in Flight" story, was originally published inin 1953.
Cities in Flight is a four-volume series of science fiction stories by American writer James Blish, originally published between 1950 and 1962, which were first known collectively as the "Okie" novels. The series features entire cities that are able to fly through space using an anti-gravity device, the spindizzy. The stories cover roughly two thousand years, from the very near future to the end of the universe. One story, "Earthman, Come Home" won a Retro Hugo Award in 2004 for Best Novelette.[1] Since 1970, the primary edition has been the omnibus volume first published in paperback by Avon Books.[2] Over the years James Blish made many changes to these stories in response to points raised in letters from readers.
The books [ edit ]
They Shall Have Stars [ edit ]
They Shall Have Stars (1956) (also published under the title Year 2018!), incorporating the stories "Bridge" and "At Death's End",[3] is set in the near future (the book begins in 2013). In this future, the Soviet Union still exists and the Cold War is still ongoing. As a result, in the West, civil liberties have been eroded more and more, until society eventually resembles the Soviet model. Alaska's Senator Bliss Wagoner, head of the Joint Congressional Committee on Space Flight, is determined to do something about it.
Scientific research has stagnated, mainly because knowledge has become restricted. On the advice of scientist Dr. Corsi, Wagoner concentrates his attention on fringe science theories. One project he has funded is the building of a "bridge" made of Ice IV on the surface of Jupiter to make measurements. This leads to one of two major discoveries which make interstellar space travel feasible: gravity manipulation (nicknamed the "spindizzy"), which leads to both a faster-than-light travel and effective shielding. Another project yields an "anti-agathic" drug, which stops aging. Wagoner is eventually convicted of treason by an oppressive regime, but not before he has sent out expeditions (in a later book, it is revealed that they succeed in establishing thriving colonies). Politically, the book clearly expresses a strong opposition to McCarthyism, at its peak during the time of writing. The main antagonist is one Francis X. MacHinery, hereditary Director of the FBI, which has become a de facto secret police agency. In the final chapter he is heard to say "Bliss Wagoner is dead", with the narrative noting that "as usual, he was wrong", as his legacy will endure.
Reviewing a later edition, the Hartford Courant described the novel as "a skillful mixture of human reality and technological fantasy".[4]
A Life for the Stars [ edit ]
In the period in between the first and second parts, the Cold War ended with the peaceful merging of the East and West blocks into a single, planet-wide Soviet-ruled dictatorship, which hardly made any perceptible change, as the West's political system had already become virtually identical with the Soviet one. However, this dictatorial power was broken by the spindizzy drive which works for very large objects, so that dissidents and malcontents have an easy way of escaping and going off into space. First factories, then eventually whole cities migrate from the economically depressed Earth in search of work; these space-wandering cities are called Okies.
A Life for the Stars (1962) is a bildungsroman describing the adventures of sixteen-year-old Chris deFord, born when the above process of migration had already been going on for a considerable time. When Chris goes to watch the imminent departure of Scranton, Pennsylvania, he is unaware that the law requires that anybody found nearby must be taken along.
After several adventures, Chris is fortunate to be transferred to the much more prosperous New York (or at least the Manhattan portion of it), a major "Okie" city under Mayor John Amalfi. Scranton is run by the city manager rather than its figurehead mayor. When the two cities meet again and come into conflict over Scranton's bungling of a job, Chris is able to convince an influential friend in his old city to depose the city manager and end the conflict. Impressed, Amalfi elevates him to the newly created position of city manager of New York and gives him the status of resident rather than passenger (and thus entitled to anti-agathic drugs).
Earthman, Come Home [ edit ]
Earthman, Come Home (1955, G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York), combining the stories "Okie", "Bindlestiff", "Sargasso of Lost Cities" and "Earthman, Come Home",[5] is the longest book in the series. It describes the many adventures of New York under Amalfi, amongst a galaxy which has planets settled at different periods of history under loose control by Earth. New York eventually ends up in an "Okie Jungle" created by an economic collapse. Amalfi realises that the "Vegan Orbital Fort", a semi-mythical remnant of the previously dominant alien civilisation, is likely to emerge in such chaos to take its revenge on Earth. His plan includes forcing the Okies to "march" on Earth, attracting the Vegan fort to join in the "march", and culminates in installating a spindizzy drive system on a small planet and using it to defend the Earth against the Vegan attack. But meanwhile the Earth Police had got a navy of big powerful armed spacecraft called "monitors", which appear from invisibility and quickly efficiently vaporize all the attacking Okie cities, except New York, which jumps unnoticed away to safety (in some editions it uses a special circuit which works only once), but the police think that they destroyed New York. At least one police monitor is destroyed in this battle. In later versions the Vegan fort destroys many police monitors.
Eventually, New York is installed on a spindizzy-equipped planet called He, which is projected out of the Milky Way galaxy, and then leaves the Milky Way galaxy and flies towards the Greater Magellanic Cloud. Some of New York's spindizzies are irreparably damaged; Amalfi convinces the New Yorkers that they must find a planet to call home from now on. On their chosen planet, New York encounters a city of renegades, which calls itself IMT (Interstellar Master Traders), whose sacking of the planet Thor 5 damaged the reputation of the cities in general, and who have enslaved the local human population. In typical fashion, Amalfi swindles the IMT residents; their city flew up and was summarily vaporized by a patrolling Earth Police monitor. Although Blish rarely defines how much time passes during each adventure, a late chapter implies that over three hundred years pass in the course of the novel. Reviewer Groff Conklin praised it as "a real, honest, pure, gee-whiz space opera."[6]
A Clash of Cymbals/The Triumph of Time [ edit ]
A Clash of Cymbals (published in the U.S. as The Triumph of Time) (1959) follows the passage of Amalfi and the planet "He" undertaking the first intergalactic transit. In the less relativistically-distorted space between the two galaxies, evidence of a collision between two universes is detected by the "Hevians" — a matter-antimatter collision that reveals the cyclic nature of reality. An alien culture is also investigating this phenomenon, which will shortly accelerate to engulf all galactic space; in other words, the colliding universes will end in a transition in between the Big Bang and Big Crunch. It will be possible to modify the future development of the fresh universes which will emerge from this singularity, and Amalfi directs the "New Earth" residents to compete with the alien culture (the Web of Hercules) in order to prevent their manipulation of the future of the universe.
As with the other books, a detailed description of the technologies used is provided, including cosmological calculus. While there are some continuity slips, the series presents a unified story of humanity's expansion across the galaxy, and the birth of a new universe.
Frederik Pohl praised the novel as "science fiction which deals with tomorrow on its own terms", citing Blish's "triumph of inventions, great and small", but concluded that despite the "brilliance" of the author's conceptions, Triumph suffered from its inadequate story.[7]
Fictional technology [ edit ]
The powerful space weapon called the Bethé blaster operates by causing a fast atomic fusion explosion in all low-atomic-weight elements in its target, thus completely vaporizing its target. It efficiently and quickly destroys any Okie city which it is fired at. It was named after Hans Bethe.
The mesotron rifle is a hand-held energy weapon.
The spindizzy is an anti-gravity and faster-than-light flight device.
The Dirac communicator allows instantaneous communication across the width of a galaxy. It was named after Paul Dirac. It occurs often in Blish's fiction and its creation is described in the novel The Quincunx of Time .
. Bethé barrier: a sort of defensive barrier sometimes set up at an Okie city's limits.
Transistor metals: the story mentions germanium often, including as a money metal, but it never mentions silicon.
Scranton circa 3000 AD is described as being largely still as it was around 1960.
Steelworks workmen's safety helmets in the story are once called "tin hats" and are thus likely made of metal sheet and not of polymer like real modern safety helmets: see Hard hat#History.
In the start of A Life for the Stars a man booking a ride in a computer-controlled taxicab spoke his social security number to it, demonstrating computer voice recognition.
Cities [ edit ]
In the year 2010 omnibus edition, these flying Okie cities are named (but many more are mentioned):-

The spindizzy was used in at least two novels by Jesse Franklin Bone, The Lani People and Confederation Matador, and appears as the nickname for fictional Heim Theory devices in Ken MacLeod's The Execution Channel.
You go to sleep with a cool, fresh glass of tap water by your bed and wake up to it tasting decidedly...off. Ever so slightly more dirt-like, I'd say. Musty, heavy, or oily, others have said. The taste difference is subtle and hard to describe, in a way that leads people who haven't noticed to claim it doesn't exist. So naturally, I called up a scientist to sort things out.
“I know exactly what you're talking about,” says Susan Richardson, a chemist at the University of South Carolina. “Funny, I've been doing research on drinking water for 26 years, and I've never thought about this question before.” In fact, Richardson emailed several of her colleagues working at water utilities and the like, all of whom said they had never been asked this question before. “It's the simple things that nobody thinks about,” she says.
Nobody has published a study on why water goes stale overnight, as far as we know. But Richardson and her colleagues did put their scientific minds together to come up with some answers—at least, some very probable answers. I also called up a water sommelier, Martin Riese, because that's a job that apparently exists in LA.
Going Stale
The biggest factor, says Richardson, is likely a simple, indirect one: temperature. “Like warm beer versus cold beer,” she says. The longer a beer has been outside of the fridge, the more its sourness, hoppiness, and whatever off-notes it has get amplified. Tap water comes in through pipes underground, where it is generally cooler. And plenty of us then add ice or drink refrigerated water.
As water rises to room temperature, its aroma and bouquet, so to speak, really open up. “When you chill something extremely,” says Riese, “your taste palate's completely gone.” We often use “taste” colloquially to mean “smell,” and smell is a function of molecules tickling cells in our noses. The warmer the drink, the faster the molecules are bouncing around, and the stronger the aroma. Riese always tastes his premium waters—such as Danish spring water1—at room temperature. He recommends drinking water chilled to a cool but not cool 59 degrees Fahrenheit—like, you know, a fine red wine.
But temperature doesn't tell the whole story, and more chemistry is at play.
If you've ever successfully raised pet fish, you'd probably had to leave out tap water for chlorine to off-gas. (If you've ever unsuccessfully raised pet fish, that may be why.) Water treatment plants add chlorine to wipe out potentially deadly pathogens. Chlorine is volatile, and it quickly dissipates into the air. At this point, we tap water drinkers may just be conditioned to think chlorine means fresh water. “If you have something like swimming pool, that's not good,” says Richardson. “But just a little bit of chlorine may make it seem refreshing.”
(Riese, who grew up in Germany drinking unchlorinated water, disagrees here on aesthetic grounds. Much to his chagrin, LA's water—which has to travel hundreds of miles from the mountains and the Colorado River—is heavily treated with chlorine and ammonia. “That really drives me crazy,” he says.)
Dissolved gases are another part of the taste. As water sits out, small amounts of carbon dioxide dissolve into the water. This forms carbonic acid, which may lower the pH just slightly. Tiny amounts of other gases, like acetone and aldehydes, may dissolve in, too. “It's very difficult to have a pure water sample for long,” says Richardson, who would know because she has to use completely pure water in her research. Leave purified water out for even 30 minutes, and it quickly becomes impure. “It'll drive me nuts in my lab,” she says. Temperature plays another indirect role, too: Cold water generally holds more dissolved gases. Additionally, some oxygen may dissolve out of the water over time.
But if you start leaving your water out for days and days, then, finally, microbes enter the equation. Algae make earthy-smelling molecules like geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol, to which the human nose is incredibly sensitive. Geosmin, incidentally, also gives rainstorms their post-rain aroma and catfish their muddy taste.
Earlier this year, people bombarded Berkeley's water utility company with complaints about an earthy taste after it began drawing from a higher, algae-filled part of a reservoir. The taste was harmless once the water was treated. If algae is growing in your water glass, it's obviously high time to chuck it. An overnight sit won't do anything to make water unsafe to drink though. The water will just taste a little funky, and now you know the chemistry of why.
1-UPDATE 5:40 PM EST 08/18/15: This story was updated to reflect the correct origin of the Danish water.
My Review I've already watched one Bella Thorne-starring horror movie that was released this weekend, and that didn't go so well. I approached this film with some trepidation, but luckily, it was unfounded, because The Babysitter is a very solid, genre-blending film. It's part Satanic cult movie, part home invasion thriller, and part action movie, all dashed with a healthy dose of black comedy, and while the tone is completely all over the place, that's part of the fun. Horror has a long fascination with babysitters, as I detailed in my review of Better Watch Out, another new horror movie from this month that I reviewed here. From Halloween to When a Stranger Calls and beyond, babysitters are a recurring plot device in an extremely high number of horror films, because they have the potential to combine two themes that resonate with American audiences — sex and property ownership. Babysitters in film are often young, beautiful girls, and in leaving them alone with your children, you're also leaving them alone with your house; when something goes wrong, they protect your child and your property. Or, I suppose, if they're evil Satanists, both your child and your house are in danger. The Babysitter would make for an interesting double-feature with Better Watch Out. Both movies are about a beautiful blonde babysitter caring for a precocious 12-year-old when some unexpected guests arrive in the house. Both movies take place during the holidays, although for some reason The Babysitter never says which holiday is happening. Both movies are a blend of genres, and both movies explicitly reference Home Alone. But in some ways, The Babysitter is everything that Better Watch Out is satirizing. Better Watch Out understands that the blatant objectification of babysitters can be dangerous, having a negative effect on both the girls themselves and the young boys they're meant to protect. The Babysitter aims for no such nuance. In this one, the boy is in love with the babysitter not because he's the product of an unhealthy culture that forces unhappy men to prove their masculinity by abusing women; he loves her because she's hot and she talks to him and she can hold her own in a conversation about spaceships and aliens. In Better Watch Out, Patrick Warburton's character is meant to be gross for ogling the babysitter. In The Babysitter, we get several point-of-view shots from the 12-year-old staring at her breasts.
LEFT: Better Watch Out. RIGHT: The Babysitter.
Still, though: for what it's aiming to do, The Babysitter does it very well. This is not a movie about objectification of women and the fragility of masculinity like Better Watch Out is, and that's fine; not everything needs to be. This one is a movie about a Satanic cult of high schoolers who need the blood of an innocent, and it's about that innocent who finds himself caught up in trying to survive the night. Besides, once the gonzo, gory fun begins, the Babysitter herself actually disappears from the movie for almost a full half hour. Part of the fun of the film is the way it sets up all of the other characters in her Satanic cult; they're all high school archetypes, obstacles that Cole must knock down, mini-bosses he must fight and defeat before he takes on the “big bad” babysitter. Rounding out the babysitter's group are the pretty, shallow cheerleader (Bella Thorne, who's actually a blast), the funny black kid (Andrew Bachelor, aka Vine star “King Bach”), the artsy/nerdy weird Asian girl (Pitch Perfect's Hana Mae Lee), and the hot jock (Robbie Amell).
They're all waaaaay too old to still be playing high schoolers — Robbie Amell looked too old in 2015's The DUFF (also starring Bella Thorne), and it's even more pronounced here. But the movie uses this to good effect. Cole is obsessed with his own outcast status, crippled by how “weird” he feels in the world, and the physical appearance of the young protagonist versus his way-too-old antagonists only heightens the feeling that the kid is taking on an insurmountable evil. As Cole outruns and outwits the cult members in succession, the movie cycles through a number of rapid-fire references to other films, including The Human Centipede, Star Trek, Home Alone, The Outsiders, Alien, Predator, Halloween, Friday the 13th, and more. The nods aren't as well-used as the ones in Better Watch Out; that is, they're not really making a point about horror film, like the subtle homages in that film were. Rather, they're just funny reflections of our stiflingly pop-culture-infused society, the characters calling out pop cultural touchstones as a means of shorthand to explain their situation. The movie toes the line between comedy and gross-out gore very well, which is probably its greatest strength. The first horror setpiece, where the movie turns and Cole realizes he's not watching an orgy-in-the-making but something very, very different, is shockingly bloody — but also, in its suddenness and willingness to cover everyone in buckets of gore, really funny. Throughout the movie, various people are shot, stabbed, hung, blown up, covered in spiders, and more, always delivered with a perfectly-timed comedic punch. In particular, Bella Thorne gets put through the ringer, and she's a good sport about it; her whiny cheerleader character provides some of the most memorable moments in the first part of the film and then some of the goriest, most shocking violence in the second half. She displays a lot of personality that was sorely missing in Amityville: The Awakening.
Software development teams often make decisions about software architecture or technological stack based on inaccurate opinions, social media, and in general on what is considered to be “hot”, rather than solid research and any serious consideration of expected impact on their projects. I call this trend Hype Driven Development, perceive it harmful and advocate for a more professional approach I call “Solid Software Engineering”. Learn more about how it works and find out what you can do instead.
New technology — new hope
Have you seen it? A team picking newest, hottest technology to apply in the project. Someone reads a blog post, it's trending on Twitter and we just came back from a conference where there was a great talk about it. Soon after, the team starts using this new shiny technology (or software architecture design paradigm), but instead of going faster (as promised) and building a better product they get into trouble. They slow down, get demotivated, have problems delivering next working version to production. Some teams even keep fixing bugs instead of delivering new features. They need ‘just a few more days' to sort it all out.
Hype Driven Development
Hype Driven Development (HDD) has many flavors and touches your project in many different ways:
Reddit driven development — when a team or individual decide on technology/architecture/design based on what popular blogger wrote or what is hot on reddit, hackernews, blogs Twitter, facebook, GitHub or other social media.
— when a team or individual decide on technology/architecture/design based on what popular blogger wrote or what is hot on reddit, hackernews, blogs Twitter, facebook, GitHub or other social media. Conference driven development — watch carefully what happens after people are back from the conference. People get inspired. And that's a two-edged sword. Starting to use newest hottest lib/framework/architecture paradigm without enough research might be a highway to hell.
— watch carefully what happens after people are back from the conference. People get inspired. And that's a two-edged sword. Starting to use newest hottest lib/framework/architecture paradigm without enough research might be a highway to hell. Loudest guy driven decisions — is when one guy is talking all the time about this new framework/lib/tech's that he has no experience with but talks about it all the time and finally the team decides to use it.
— is when one guy is talking all the time about this new framework/lib/tech's that he has no experience with but talks about it all the time and finally the team decides to use it. Gem/lib/plugin driven development — especially strong in Ruby On Rails community, where occasionally I can see a Gemfile so long that the only thing longer is the time it takes to load the app. It comes from the idea that every problem in rails should be solved with a gem. Sometimes it would take a couple of lines to build a solution ourselves. But we're just solving problems by adding libs, plugins, gems or frameworks.

Sometimes it would take a couple of lines to build a solution ourselves. But we're just solving problems by adding libs, plugins, gems or frameworks. I would also mention here behavior popular among hype driven developers — Stack Overflow driven development — when developers copy-paste solutions from Stackoverflow (or in general from the internet) without really understanding them.
HDD is how teams bring doom on themselves
The problem with hype is that it easily leads to bad decisions. Both bad architectural decisions and technological stack decisions often haunt a team month or even years later. In the worst case, they may lead to another very problematic situation in software engineering: The Big Rewrite. Which almost never works out.
The root of all evil seems to be social media — where new ideas spread much faster than they get tested. Much faster than people are able to understand their pros and cons.
The Anatomy of Hype
Most hypes have a similar structure. Here it goes:
Step 1: Real problem and solution
They start in some company with a problem. A team within some company decides that solution to the problem is beyond the current technological stack, process or architecture. The company creates a new framework, library or paradigm and soon the problem is solved.
Step 2: Announcement, buzz, and keywords
The team is excited to show their work to the rest of the world and soon they write blog posts and do talks on conferences. The problem oftentimes is non-trivial, so they are proud to present the impressive results of a non-trivial solution. People get excited about the new technology. The only problem is not everybody who gets excited is able to fully understand what the exact problem was and all the details of the solution. It was a non-trivial problem with a non-trivial solution after all. Takes more than a tweet, chit-chat or even blog post to explain. With communication tools like social media, blog posts and conference lightning talks the message gets blurred along the way.
Step 3: Mania starts
All shades of hype driven developers read blog posts and attend conferences. Soon the teams all over the world start using the new technology. Due to the blurred message — some of them make hasty decision to use framework even though it does not solve any of their actual problems. Yet the team does have the expectation that this new technology will help.
Step 4: Disappointment
As the sprints go by, the technology does not improve the team's life as much as people hoped but brings a lot of extra work. There's a lot of rewriting the code and extra learning for the team. Teams slow down, management gets pissed off. People feel cheated.
Step 5: Realisation!
Finally, the team does retrospection and realizes what are the tradeoffs of the new technology and for what purpose it would be more relevant. They get wiser… till the next hype shows up.
Examples of Hype:
Let's examine some examples of hypes and see how those went through.
Example 1: React.js
Step 1: Facebook has a problem — advanced one-page apps like Facebook itself have, so many state changing events that it is hard to keep track what's going on and keep the application state consistent.
Step 2: Facebook promotes new paradigm with buzzwords: functional, virtual DOM, components.
Step 3: Mania: Facebook has created the front-end framework of the future! Let's write everything in react from now on!
Step 4: Wait there is a lot of work, but no quick return on investment!
Step 5: React is great for an advanced one-page app with lots of real-time notifications but does not necessarily pay off for simpler applications.
Example 2: TDD is dead by DHH
Step 1: David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH, creator of Ruby on Rails framework) realises that it is hard to do TDD with Rails as this framework doesn't have architecture supporting good OOP. Makes a pragmatic choice — not to write tests upfront.
Step 2: Hype starts with DHH blog post and conference talk. Hype keywords: TDD is DEAD.
Step 3: Let's skip tests! Our Guru says so. We didn't write them anyway. Now we're at least not pretending. We're finally honest.
Step 4: Wait! Even fewer things work now than before. We've built a buggy code.
Step 5: “TDD is not dead or alive. TDD is subject to tradeoffs, including risk of API changes, skill of practitioner and existing design” — Kent Beck.
Example 3: Microservices
Step 1: Big monolith application scales hard. There is a point when we can break them down into services. It will be easier to scale in terms of req/sec and easier to scale across multiple teams.
Step 2: Hype keywords: scalability, loose coupling, monolith.
Step 3: Let's rewrite all to services! We have a ‘spaghetti code' because we have a monolith architecture! We need to rewrite everything to microservices!
Step 4: Shit! It is a now way slower to develop the app, difficult to deploy and we spend a lot of time tracking bugs across multiple systems.
Step 5: Microservices require a lot of devops skills in the team and with right investment might pay off as a way to scale the system and team. Before you reach serious scale issues it's an overinvestment. Microservices are extracted not written. You must be this tall to use microservices.
Example 4: NoSQL
Step 1: SQL databases have problems with high loads and unstructured data. Teams around the world start developing the new generation of databases.
Step 2: Hype keywords: Scalability, BigData, High Performance.
Step 3: Our database is too slow and not big enough! We need NoSql!
Step 4: We need to join tables? That is a no-go. Simple SQL operations are becoming increasingly challenging. Development is slow and our core problems are not solved.
Step 5: NoSql are tools to solve very specific problems (either extremely high volumes of data, unstructured data or very high load). SQL is actually a great tool and handles high load and huge data volumes well if used skillfully. The case for NoSql is still pretty rare in 2016.
Example 5: Elixir and Phoenix (or put your favorite lang/framework pair here)
Step 1: Web frameworks like Ruby On Rails don't deal well with high performance applications, distributed applications, and websockets.
Step 2: Hype keywords: Scalability, High Performance, Distributed, Fault-tolerant.
Step 3: Oh my god, our application is slow and our chat is not scalable!
Step 4: Wow, learning functional programming and distributed approach is not that easy. We are now really slow.
Step 5: Elixir and Phoenix is a great framework, but takes a significant effort to learn. It will pay back in a long run if you need specifically high performance app.
The list goes on and on:
In this crowded space of computer engineering, we have a lot of areas where hypes are common. In JavaScript world, new frameworks are born everyday. Node.js (keywords: event programming), reactive programming, Meteor.js (keywords: shared state), front-end MVC, React.js. You name it. In software engineering, new architectures are born: Domain Driven Development, Hexagon, DCI. What is your favorite hype?
The US shares responsibility for the ongoing migrant crisis, according to Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern. Speaking on the sidelines of an EU summit in Malta, he stated that American “interventions” are in part to blame for the refugee flows.
“There is no doubt that America shares responsibility for the refugee flows by the way how it intervened militarily,” Kern said on Saturday, as cited by AFP.
“It's unacceptable for the international community if America wants to avoid responsibility. We need to make this clear to our American friends. I'm convinced that there will be a high degree of unanimity [among EU leaders] on this question,” Kern went on to say.

The refugee crisis that has engulfed the world due to these conflicts has been the major point of discussion for the EU summit in Malta. The attendees have not been pleased with the agenda of the current US administration with regard to this issue.
While criticizing interventions launched by former US administrations, the Austrian chancellor also lashed out at the newly elected president's recent move to ban entry to the United States to residents of seven Muslim states.
“The entry bans against seven Muslim countries are... highly problematic. We should win these countries as allies in the fight against [radical] Islamism, not define them as adversaries,” Kern stated.
Last week, Donald Trump issued an executive order that banned citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days. The roll-out of the executive order caused mass confusion, deportations, protests, and lawsuits.
The attorneys general of 16 states and the District of Columbia issued a joint statement earlier this week calling the executive order “unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful.” As a result, US District Court Judge James Robart issued a nationwide restraining order against enforcing the president's will, noting, however, its temporary nature.

Trump's travel ban has not been met well by the international community or the American public.
Just ahead of the Malta meeting, EU President Donald Tusk took an unprecedented step, warning European leaders that Trump's policies posed a potential “threat” to the bloc, along with China, Russia, and radical Islam. German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated at the summit that “fighting international terrorism is not something that will justify throwing a general suspicion on people of a certain faith or a certain origin.”
French President Francois Hollande also expressed concern over Trump's recent statements, whether regarding US membership in NATO, Brexit, or criticism of the EU's migrant policies, noting that “what matters is solidarity at the EU level” because “who knows what the US president really wants, particularly in relation to the Atlantic alliance and burden-sharing?”
The European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said there was nothing to fear with regard to Trump, yet he voiced concern that the new US administration may not be entirely on top of the current world affairs.
European leaders bark much, but never bite – Spanish MEP
Spanish MEP Javier Couso told RT that the EU states are united in their criticism of Trump's migrant policies, as they contradict European values.
Read more
“Trump's comments are quite aggressive... It should be noted that the actions of Trump, responsible for governing a UN member-country, against migrants and refugees are in stark contrast with our culture, our judgments. With regard to this we share the same opinion... We believe that we can not judge one nation, or one religion, can not generalize, because it makes no sense. After all, a lot of the terrorists were from Saudi Arabia, and the measures were not taken against this country, as it is one of the main US allies in the region.”
According to Couso, it is unlikely the EU will adopt any preventive measures against the policies of the US administration as the “US holds great power,” while European leaders “bark but never bite.”
“I think there are two opinions in the EU. On the one hand, there is a part that wants a unified approach to face the challenges associated with the new administration more aggressively. On the other hand, there are leaders, like Mariano Rajoy, who expressed the need to calmly observe the actions of the administration. These claim that it is necessary to defend the unity of Europe, but to do it in a more relaxed manner.
“I do not know where we will come at the end. Whether we will start confrontation or not. After all, enormous power is concentrated in the US, while European leaders bark much, but never bite, so it is difficult to predict the course the future events.”
Liverpool make £19.8m loss in last financial year despite record-breaking revenue
Liverpool have revealed pre-tax losses of £19.8m to May 31, 2016
Liverpool made a pre-tax loss of £19.8m last year despite revenue breaking through the £300m mark for the first time.
After two years in the black, the club dropped back into the red according to the club's official accounts, for the year ending May 31, 2016.
The loss was largely due to investment in the first-team squad plus pay-offs to manager Brendan Rodgers - sacked in October 2015 - and his backroom staff.
Roberto Firmino cost Liverpool £29m from Hoffenheim
Twelve additions were made to the squad, including Christian Benteke for £32m, no longer at the club having been sold after one season to Crystal Palace at a £5m loss, and £29m Roberto Firmino.
There were also six new contract extensions and some costs associated with the redevelopment of the Main Stand at Anfield.
In the same accounting period the club did, however, sell Raheem Sterling to Manchester City in a £49m deal.
There has been an increase in income as a result of commercial deals and the capacity of hospitality in the new Main
Stand has doubled.
Raheem Sterling left Anfield for Manchester City for £49m
The club is expecting to see "significantly improved results" for the current financial year.
Overall revenue, which has grown year on year since Fenway Sports Group took over in October 2010, increased to a record £301m, up from £297.9m the previous year when the club posted a £60m profit in the main thanks to the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.
Commercial revenue dipped by £700,000 to £115.7m - partly as a result of work on the Main Stand restricting non-match day access - while match-day revenue increased by £3.4m to £62.4m thanks to income from a pre-season tour to Australia and Asia and the team reaching the League Cup and Europa League finals.
Work on Anfield's new Main Stand restricted non-match day access
Media revenue increased by £1m to £123.6m.
"The increase in the underlying revenue adds further strength to the club's financial position, despite the cost of football rising with player transfer fees, wages and agents' costs," said chief operating officer Andy Hughes.
"During this reporting period, we also agreed a new five-year credit facility which further secures the club's long-term financial stability.
"All three main revenues streams continue to show strength and commercial revenues held firm irrespective of the impact of the Main Stand at Anfield."
Liverpool is the only club in the top 10 of the Deloitte football money league [in ninth place] that did not play in the Champions League last season - demonstrating the strength of its commercial operations to support reinvestment into the playing squad.
"Since this reporting period, which is nearly a year ago, we have continued to make solid financial progress and we expect to see further growth in our revenues following the successful opening of the main stand and the new media deal," added Hughes.
"Our commercial operations continue to thrive through new partnerships, global retail growth and developing our international soccer schools, with our newest academy opening recently in Australia.
"The investments from this ownership have been a key factor to our financial and global progress.
"We have seen continued investment in the playing squad, the expanded Main Stand, the new flagship retail store opening later this year, fully refurbished retail stores in Liverpool and Belfast, and we are consulting on a proposed development at our academy in Kirkby to bring together the first team and our young players.
"These investments all contribute to further progress and strengthen the club's financial position which ultimately serves to support all of our football ambitions."

The initiative aims to provide a forum for the growing number of singles who are interested in living in Israel and prefer to meet others with a similar goal.
“Many young olim who have a passion for Israel and Zionism express a desire to connect with similar minded people,” says Nefesh B'Nefesh Director of Pre-Aliyah Marc Rosenberg.
“We also encounter immense excitement and anticipation among local singles – both olim and Israelis – when we have groups of North American singles arriving on aliyah. This dating site will provide a great forum to bring these people together.”
SawYouAtSinai is a Jewish internet dating and Jewish matchmaking service that is helping thousands of Jewish singles of various ages, backgrounds, cultures and interests find their match ("bashert").
The combination of SawYouAtSinai's unique matching technology and the personalized touch of their matchmakers has helped over 2,000 singles meet their match.
'We're excited to use our technology and expertise to create matches amongst aliyah-minded singles,” says Danielle Solomon, head of SawYouAtSinai's Israel Division. “We look forward to these couples creating their homes in Israel.”
Malaysia's F1 chief has revealed that the Sepang circuit has undergone significant changes ahead of the 2016 race.
Usually one of the first races each year, the event just outside Kuala Lumpur has instead been paired with the nearby and popular Singapore night race this season.
“On Monday after race day in Singapore, the F1 freight will be transported by road to the Sepang circuit,” said Sepang chief Razlan Razali.
“It's the first time it's been done in the region,” he added.
Another novel feature of the 2016 Malaysian grand prix, Razali added, is changes to the actual corners at Sepang, which according to the Straits Times newspaper have been done to encourage overtaking.
“There will be some unknowns for the teams and drivers as we've changed the dynamics of the circuit a little bit at the various turns,” Razali confirmed.
“It will be as if they've come to Sepang circuit for the first time.”
Singapore's race is on 18 September, with Malaysia taking place two weeks later.
[Portraits by Jason Florio]
Frances Irwin is 90 years old. She was born in Poland and lives in Brooklyn. She is a Holocaust survivor.
Frances is lonely, even though her son takes care of her. She collects used aluminum foil in a kitchen piled high with paper plates. She relies on an emergency wristband to call for help. When you ask her to, she is able to vividly recall the worst of her World War II experience. She displays a mix of shame and trepidation when deciding whether to roll up her sleeve and show the world her forearm, tattooed at Auschwitz.
The truth is that Frances, like all Holocaust survivors, is old. Like many survivors, she's dependent on Jewish and social welfare. She's not living as well as she deserves to live. One day, not long from now, Frances and the others like her will die. Then there will be no more Holocaust survivors left.
Writer Ron Rosenbaum once noted in these pages that one of the greatest risks of Jewish life today is the smothering sentimentalization of our memory of the Shoah. Frances' closing chapter offers no “meretricious uplift.” The fact that she survived Auschwitz only to suffer at the end of her life is appalling and embarrassing. These are painful things to think about, let alone say. And part of the uneasiness comes from the way wealthy and comfortable American Jews have used “remembering the Holocaust” as the touchstone of their communal existence.
When a recent, highly publicized and debated Pew study asked, “What does being Jewish mean in America today?” an astonishing 73 percent of U.S. Jews replied that “remembering the Holocaust” was “essential to their sense of Jewishness.” Another 69 percent also cited “leading an ethical life.” More than half (56 percent) said that “working for justice and equality is essential to what being Jewish means to them.” To U.S. Jews, more important than any other identifying factor was this bizarre enshrinement of memory.
How then Frances?
World War II ended nearly 70 years ago. Even accounting for those who lived through the war as opposed to having directly suffered its most terrible expressions, the number of survivors still alive today across the world is probably in the low hundreds of thousands, and dwindling. Earlier this month, after an initiative announced by Vice President Joe Biden, the U.S. Senate's Special Committee on Aging noted in a hearing on Holocaust survivors that one fourth of the roughly 140,000 survivors in America live at or below the poverty line. Some other estimates put more than half of the survivors living in the United States below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, meaning they earn less than $21,660 annually. The problem is serious enough that last week, the Obama Administration named the first Special Envoy for U.S. Holocaust Survivor Services, charged with caring for this population. “Living in poverty, plagued by immeasurable loss, they are at risk of falling into isolation and despair,” Lee Sherman, the president of the Association of Jewish Family and Children's Agencies, told the Senate. According to Elihu Kover of Nazi Victim Services for Selfhelp Community Services, more than half of the thousands of survivors who live in New York City can be classified as “very poor” or “near poor” under federal guidelines.
At the Senate hearing, Kover put it even more starkly: “Holocaust survivors are growing older and frailer. The twenty-year-old who survived Auschwitz is now eighty-eight. She may be coping with the loss of her spouse and have no family to speak of. In addition to the myriad problems associated with so-called ‘normal aging,' many survivors have numerous physical and psychological problems directly attributable to their experiences during the Holocaust. Prolonged periods of starvation, exposure to severe weather conditions with inadequate clothing, and experiencing and witnessing unspeakable atrocities take a severe toll on body and mind. And many of these problems only surface in old age, having been hidden during their working years when the survivors struggled and made a new life for themselves as productive citizens of this country.”
On this day in 1945, the largest Nazi death camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, was liberated by Soviet troops. In 2005, the United Nations declared Jan. 27 an international memorial day for the victims of the Holocaust. In honor of this, we asked photographer Jason Florio to take humane portraits of a small sampling of New York's Holocaust survivors—to avoid remembering the Shoah in the abstract, and to remind our readers of the dignified specificity of each survivor's life.
We've gathered nine portraits, with short audio interviews. We are not the psychiatrists of Yale's “Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies,” facing facts for the first time. We are not Steven Spielberg or the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, archiving oral and visual history. We aren't a filmmaker, artist, or writer, grappling for years with the complicated moral, aesthetic, and historical legacy of the Shoah, like Claude Lanzmann, Art Spiegelman, or Aharon Appelfeld. We are American Jews remembering the Holocaust, without forgetting its survivors. We hope you'll take a few minutes of your time today to do so, too, by scrolling below.
I've gotten tired of explaining why supply-side economics — i.e., voodoo economics — don't actually work. So I've decided to write up a quick-and-dirty version that I can just link to as necessary. This is not meant to be a definitive statement on the subject. It's not even an air-tight argument of the principles being espoused. It's just me pointing at some pretty fundamental absurdities in voodoo economics and saying, “Hey! Look! Have you even thought about this? It doesn't make any sense!”
(1) Money is a form of power. Power tends to accumulate more power. Thus, in a capitalist society, wealth tends to flow up, not down. The rich tend to become richer and the poor tend to become poorer. Supplying the wealthy with even more money doesn't cause that money to flow down to the poor — it just accelerates this natural trend. Which is why, every time supply-side economics have been attempted, the divide between the rich and the poor has grown wider.
The argument has been made that a “rising tide raises all ships”, but the reason this disproportionate distribution of wealth is a problem leads us to…
(2) The modus operandi of capitalism is consumer spending. In a capitalist system you have multiple products available, and those products which have the greatest value to the consumer succeed (because they buy them) and those which have less value fail (because they don't). In a very real sense, capitalism is a democracy in which you vote with your dollars for the products you like best. And although in practice a capitalist system can become flawed in many ways, capitalism has widely proven itself to be the best system for encouraging quality, efficiency, and innovation.
You need an unequal distribution of wealth for this system to work, but when that inequality becomes sufficiently disproportionate the reduced spending power enjoyed by the majority of your consumers results in a less efficient system. Not only are the quality of decisions which emerge from such a system degraded, but the system's ability to encourage increased value and quality becomes quashed.
This all leads us to the fundamenal problem with supply-side economics…
(3) If you want to stimulate a capitalist economy, you should be giving tax breaks to the poor, not the rich.
The reason for this is the difference between spending and investing. Republicans argue that giving tax cuts to the rich allow them to invest in business. By investing in business, the argument goes, the economy grows and the workers end up benefitting in the long run.
But while investing is an important part of capitalism, it's the secondary mechanism of the capitalist system. The primary mechanism of a capitalist system is spending.
If you give money to someone and have them invest it, that money may or may not eventually result in economic activity and capitalist success. (Whether it does or not will depend entirely on how the money is invested. If it's invested in a better, cheaper product that people want, it will stimulate the economy. If it isn't, then it won't.)
But if you give the money to someone and have them spend it, that money immediately results in economic activity and capitalist success. This result is guaranteed.
In other words: If you give the money to an investor, you are injecting that money into the economy in an inefficient manner — that money may or may not end up growing a business producing products that consumers want.
If you give that money to a consumer, on the other hand, you are injecting that money almost directly into the economy — that money will automatically end up growing a business producing products that consumers want (because the consumer will spend it on the products that they want).
(4) The name “trickle down economics” is actually truth in advertising. Money in a capitalist system flows reliably from the consumer to the successful business/investor/capitalist. Movement in the opposite direction, however, is not reliable.
Which actually brings us full circle: In capitalism, wealth tends to flow up and trickle down. If you want to stimulate an economy, you want to make the money flow and, thus, encourage better ideas and more valuable products.
And that means tax cuts for the poor and the middle-class, not the rich.
THE OTHER FALLACY
Of course, this conclusion simply opens the door to the larger question of when such tax cuts are appropriate. The other fallacy of voodoo economics is the claim that lowering taxes will always result in sufficient economic growth to raise overall tax revenues. This is self-evidently not true for several reasons:
(1) If you reduce the tax rate to 0%, it doesn't matter how much economic growth you enjoy as a result: You still won't end up with increased tax revenues (since you're not collecting any).
(2) Even if you replace “no taxes” with “infinitesimal taxes”, the conclusion is still palpably absurd. If you have an average tax rate of 30% and you lower that to an average tax rate of 1%, you're claiming that the economy will grow to 30 times its current size entirely as a result of the tax cuts. (That means you can't count inflation or the normal economic growth that would have occurred even if you hadn't cut taxes.)
The underlying fallacy here is the belief that the social institutions and infrastructure created by our government have no positive role on economic growth. Common sense alone should tell you that a certain degree of social infrastructure (e.g. law and order), physical infrastructure (e.g. roads), and educational infrastructure (e.g. univeral education) is beneficial to the economy (even if one ignores all the other societal benefits). And even the most cursory analysis of history shows this to be true: Anarchy is not conducive to economic growth.
On the other hand, it is equally trivial to demonstrate that the opposite extreme is equally absurd: The benefits brought by government cannot possibly outweigh the problems caused by an average tax rate of 100%.
The inevitable conclusion is that there is a sweet spot in which both the benefits of low taxes and the benefits of the societal infrastructure provided by our government are maximized.
Or to look at it another way: The problem with both extremist libertarians and communists is that they equally fail to appreciate the sweet spot between anarchic liberty and absolute central control.
BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of different countries while implementing the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). At the same time, he praised the China Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), which violates Indian sovereignty as a "flagship" project of BRI."All countries should respect each other's sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity, each other;s development paths and social systems, and each other's core interests and major concerns," Xi said while inaugurated the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on Sunday.India is the only major country that did not participate in the BRI event. But that will not stop China from trying to persuade India to join the program to build connectivity infrastructure."China needs India's participation more than it needs the United States'. It does not serve China's image and strategic interests to establish linkages in distant places while being unable to mend fences in its neighborhood," David Kelly, director of geopolitics at the Beijing-based consulting firm, China Policy, told VOA.Kelly does not think India would lose much by not showing up. "India's development pattern follows an entirely different rhythm compared to China. India will continue to grow at its own pace regardless of whether it joins the BRI or not," he said.In his opening speech, Xi pledged $124 billion in financial assistance, which is double of what the World Bank lent in 2016, for the Belt and Road program. The plan involves the creation of six economic corridors including CPEC crisscrossing different parts of Asia and Europe.Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif , who was one of the speakers at the BRI, could not resist the temptation to take a dig at India without naming it."Let me make it very clear that CPEC is an economic undertaking open to all countries in the region. It has no geographical boundaries. It must not be politicized," Sharif said.Representatives of the United States and Germany did some plain speaking reminding China of the need for maintaining transparency in project planning and giving equal opportunities to all stakeholders in the allocation of finance and purchase of machinery. China has been blamed for supporting projects that provide business to Chinese companies and banks while sidelining other competitors.Sunday's event showed China's eagerness to expand BRI into a major trade and development initiative instead of restricting it to infrastructure construction. He offered funds for poverty eradication and health centers in developing countries besides allocating money for infrastructure construction.Analysts said a major part of the assistance would go to projects that provide construction and machinery supply opportunities to Chinese companies. BRI is at once an economic stimulus for China's domestic economy as it is a quest for raising its international standing."We should jointly create an environment that will facilitate opening up and development, establish a fair, equitable and transparent system of international trade and investment rules," Xi said in his inaugural address to the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on SundayChina will sign trade agreements with 30 countries during the two-day Forum, and gradually expand it to cover 60 countries who are connected to the Belt and Road plan, he said.The event was attended by heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and the World Trade Organization besides leaders from different countries including Germany, Britain, France and Italy. Russian president Vladimir Putin was the most important foreign leader on the dias."U.S. firms have a long and successful track record in global infrastructure development, and are ready to participate in Belt and Road projects," Matt Pottinger, Special Assistant to the U.S. President said during one of the sessions at the Forum. He announced the creation of an American Belt and Road Working Group with representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and American companies.
I don't pretend to be a higher-education expert, but as a student, I know that I am better served by a university administration that refrains from treating me like a suspect when my main interest is learning. I know that I will not fulfil my academic interests if I fear government repercussions for carrying out research.
Perhaps the most depressing aspect of the Prevention legislation is that it shows that our government agrees with the logic used by some students to justify ‘safe spaces' and ‘trigger warnings' for potentially upsetting content. Indeed, censorship on campus is hardly a unique phenomenon. Spiked's free speech university rankings from 2016 revealed that speech is censored by student unions on 90 per cent of British university campuses. Hyper-sensitive students have rebelled against all kinds of speakers: from feminist academics like Germaine Greer to conservative Catholics like Timothy Stanley. However, Prevent expands campus censorship to levels that student snowflakes could only dream of. It attacks the ‘wrong kind' of political speech via top-down directives with the threat of state force. It is a menacing threat to academic freedom.
Those who contend that students need to be sheltered away from some ideas must face another tricky question: who decides what counts as extremism? Should we hand over the academic freedom – the very basis of our university system – to judges or tribunals?
Students must ask themselves this simple question: who should decide for you what you can and cannot debate, Amber Rudd, or yourself? Those who consider themselves to be rational, moral agents must demand that the Home Office has no say in the free exchange of ideas on campus.
The Home Secretary is a graduate of Edinburgh University, where I currently study. Rudd graduated in the 80s, but I can assure her that Edinburgh students since her time have not lost the ability to confront different ideas. Many of us are keen to hear from Islamists, far-right extremists and radical populists. We want to pick apart bad ideas, not protect them through censorship.

(Reuters) - A knife-wielding man was shot by police after stabbing six people at a mental health clinic outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Friday afternoon, authorities said.
Dustin Johnson, 38, is accused of starting the attack shortly after entering the Turtle Creek Valley Mental Health center in Homestead around 2 p.m. local time (1900 GMT), the Allegheny County Police Department said.
Police said Johnson went to the fifth floor of the facility where he stabbed the victims, while armed with two knives as well as what appeared to be a handgun but was later determined to be a BB gun.
Johnson stabbed two residents and three employees, local media reported. One of the residents was in a critical condition while the rest of the victims were stable, WPXI.com reported.
Police said SWAT officers were attempting to negotiate with Johnson when the victims and their relatives began calling 911, saying they were bleeding out from their wounds. Three officers subsequently opened fire on Johnson, police said.
Police said Johnson was taken to an area hospital and was undergoing surgery.
Local broadcaster WTAE interviewed staff member CJ Fulton who witnessed the incident and said Johnson was a former patient.
Fulton said Johnson "was angry from something that happened when he was staying there with us, when he was a patient, and he started saying, 'You ruined my life,'" before launching into his stabbing spree.

Buffalonians drink more Labatt beer than in any other city in the United States.
So what better place to highlight the brand's history with a restaurant that gives beer drinkers the chance to influence new Labatt brews?
Labatt USA said Wednesday it will open a flagship restaurant and small test brewery called the “John Labatt House” in the Cobblestone District as part of a project by Pegula Sports and Entertainment to redevelop a five-story warehouse on Perry Street near KeyBank Center.
“We want to make this a destination within the City of Buffalo,” said Glen Tibbits, general manager of Labatt USA, the Buffalo-based importer of the Canadian beer brand.
Specific details are still being developed, but Labatt will be the anchor tenant in Pegula Sports and Entertainment's redevelopment of the Hi-Temp Fabrication building at 79 Perry St. into retail, commercial and residential space. Labatt will also relocate its headquarters from Fountain Plaza to the facility's second floor.
The project's total costs are still undetermined, but the first two floors are likely to cost more than $10 million, said Bruce Popko, chief operating officer of PSE. That first phase is expected to be completed by fall 2018, with the office space coming before the restaurant.
“This will be another tremendous addition to the emerging district near Buffalo's waterfront,” said PSE President and Managing Partner Russ Brandon.
Citing the Pegulas' investments in buying the Sabres and Bills, building HarborCenter, and bringing various hockey and basketball events to the city, Brandon called the project “the exact vision that Terry and Kim had in making Buffalo a destination for generations to come.”
The brewery will open alongside the first-floor restaurant as a pilot project to develop and test new products before bringing them to market, Labatt USA executives announced during a news conference with Pegula Sports and Entertainment on Wednesday. Both are the first of their kind for Labatt in the United States, although parent North American Breweries has similar restaurants and test sites for its other brands.
PSE's hospitality division will operate the restaurant. The company said beer drinkers will be able to “taste, experience and influence new beer development for Labatt” at the site.
Both Labatt and Pegula executives cited the two companies' long relationship as instrumental in developing the project. Labatt has partnered with the Sabres for 30 years and the Bills for 25 years and has also worked with Buffalo-based Try-It Distributing for over 70 years.
“Today, we're all getting in the beer business together, and that's going to be a lot of fun,” said Kris Sirchio, CEO of North American Breweries. “I'm very excited to see where that's going to take us.”
PSE will seek out other design elements to highlight the building's history. An architect will be chosen within days, and additional plans will be unveiled later. McGuire Development Co. will manage the redevelopment process for PSE.
“Success here of course means success for the city,” Tibbits said. “It means new jobs, new investment and continued development of the waterfront, the Canalside area. And it's amazing to take a dream like this and make it a reality.”

Located at the corner of Illinois and Perry streets, the 79,030-square-foot building was constructed in 1914 as a manufacturing plant for Peerless Mill Supply Co. That company's successor, Peerless Inc., still occupies part of the building, along with Hi-Temp, which is owned by the McKendry family.
The proposal to turn the building into a restaurant, commercial and residential space is the latest in a string of new developments in the Cobblestone District, including updates at the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino and the redevelopment of the Fairmont Creamery Building on Scott Street. Mayor Byron W. Brown said he has tallied more than $635 million in development in the district since 2012.
“This area continues to emerge as one of the most popular destinations in this region, not only attracting people from throughout Western New York, but from around the nation and internationally as well,” Brown said.
The Pegulas bought the building in February from the McKendrys, paying $7 million, but did not elaborate on their plans for it at the time. They will take possession of the building in 10 days, while Hi-Temp and Peerless will relocate elsewhere.
“Upon completing the purchase of this historic property, our team thoroughly examined the needs of the Cobblestone district and its surrounding area,” Brandon said. “We determined that there is a great need for another regional attraction that also features a permanent residential component.”
Pegula Sports and Entertainment, which owns the Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo Bills, HarborCenter, and other businesses, maintains its corporate offices under a lease at the nearby Fairmont Creamery Building at 199 Scott St., within sight of the Hi-Temp building. Officials said no decisions have been made about whether the Pegulas might also move their own company or the Sabres team offices.
“Being able to really connect all the parts and pieces that are going down here in Cobblestone and make this area even a bigger attraction, it was just a no-brainer for us,” Kim Pegula said. “It's a great building, so strongly built. It's a huge building, with so many opportunities, and Labatt's being the anchor, it really helps get everything started.”
Having residential apartments is another nice option, she said.
“What more could you want? Go to a game, drink some beer and go right into bed,” she laughed. “Some of my executive vice presidents have already asked for an apartment so they don't even have to go home.”
Popko called the project “the next phase” of developing the area for the Pegulas, and hinted that more was possible. “I would say that we're in constant contact with the private sector and the public sector to explore those opportunities.”
Founded in Canada in 1847, Labatt has been importing beer into the United States since 1951.
Labatt USA, which has the exclusive rights to import, market and sell Labatt beer in the United States, is separate from the original Canadian company, which is owned by Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev.
As part of the $52 billion acquisition of St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch by Amsterdam-based Inbev in 2008, the companies agreed to divest the U.S. Labatt business, which was acquired by Rochester-based North American Breweries.
Labatt USA, which employs 56 people locally, has offices on the 9th floor of 50 Fountain Plaza, where it has been based since 2007. That's when it moved with 18 employees from Norwalk, Conn. Company officials at the time cited the importance of Buffalo to its national sales.
"That opportunity has allowed us to see first-hand the renaissance that has taken place here in Buffalo over the last 10 years, to live and thrive in this community," Sirchio said.
Its workforce has grown by 40 percent in the last three years.
“We are taking our decades-long commitment to the Buffalo Niagara region and creating a destination where we can have a new conversation with our most loyal beer drinkers that will influence innovation for Labatt throughout the country," Tibbits said. "This is a natural evolution for both partners, and an amazing opportunity for beer, sports and downtown Buffalo. Now, bring on the Cup!”
The Dublin Core Schema is a small set of vocabulary terms that can be used to describe digital resources (video, images, web pages, etc.), as well as physical resources such as books or CDs, and objects like artworks.[1] The full set of Dublin Core metadata terms can be found on the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) website.[2] The original set of 15 classic[3] metadata terms, known as the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (DCMES),[4] is endorsed in the following standards documents:
Dublin Core metadata may be used for multiple purposes, from simple resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different metadata standards, to providing interoperability for metadata vocabularies in the linked data cloud and Semantic Web implementations.
Background [ edit ]
"Dublin" refers to Dublin, Ohio, USA where the schema originated during the 1995 invitational OCLC/NCSA Metadata Workshop,[8] hosted by the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center), a library consortium based in Dublin, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). "Core" refers to the metadata terms as "broad and generic being usable for describing a wide range of resources".[4] The semantics of Dublin Core were established and are maintained by an international, cross-disciplinary group of professionals from librarianship, computer science, text encoding, museums, and other related fields of scholarship and practice.
Starting in 2000, the Dublin Core community focused on "application profiles" – the idea that metadata records would use Dublin Core together with other specialized vocabularies to meet particular implementation requirements. During that time, the World Wide Web Consortium's work on a generic data model for metadata, the Resource Description Framework (RDF), was maturing. As part of an extended set of DCMI metadata terms, Dublin Core became one of the most popular vocabularies for use with RDF, more recently in the context of the linked data movement.[9]
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)[10] provides an open forum for the development of interoperable online metadata standards for a broad range of purposes and of business models. DCMI's activities include consensus-driven working groups, global conferences and workshops, standards liaison, and educational efforts to promote widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices. In 2008, DCMI separated from OCLC and incorporated as an independent entity.[11]
Currently, any and all changes that are made to the Dublin Core standard, are reviewed by a DCMI Usage Board within the context of a DCMI Namespace Policy (DCMI-NAMESPACE). This policy describes how terms are assigned and also sets limits on the amount of editorial changes allowed to the labels, definitions, and usage comments.[12]
Levels of the standard [ edit ]
The Dublin Core standard originally included two levels: Simple and Qualified. Simple Dublin Core comprised 15 elements; Qualified Dublin Core included three additional elements (Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder), as well as a group of element refinements (also called qualifiers) that could refine the semantics of the elements in ways that may be useful in resource discovery.
Since 2012, the two have been incorporated into the DCMI Metadata Terms as a single set of terms using the RDF data model.[13] The full set of elements is found under the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms/. Because the definition of the terms often contains domains and ranges, which may not be compatible with the pre-RDF definitions used for the original 15 Dublin Core elements, there is a separate namespace for the original 15 elements as previously defined: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/.[14]
Dublin Core Metadata Element Set [ edit ]
The original DCMES Version 1.1 consists of 15 metadata elements:[4]
Title Creator Subject Description Publisher Contributor Date Type Format Identifier Source Language Relation Coverage Rights
Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became a NISO standards, Z39.85, and IETF RFC 5013 in 2007. ISO 15836 standard in 2009 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of learning resources in the ISO/IEC 19788-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR) – Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36.
Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in the Dublin Core Metadata Registry.[15]
Encoding examples [ edit ]
< meta name = "DC.Format" content = "video/mpeg; 10 minutes" /> < meta name = "DC.Language" content = "en" /> < meta name = "DC.Publisher" content = "publisher-name" /> < meta name = "DC.Title" content = "HYP" />
Example of use [and mention] by WebCite [ edit ]
On the "archive form" web page for WebCite it says,[16] in part: "Metadata (optional): These are Dublin Core elements. [...]".
Qualified Dublin Core [ edit ]
(Superseded in 2008 by the DCMI Metadata Terms.[17]) Subsequent to the specification of the original 15 elements, an ongoing process to develop exemplary terms extending or refining the DCMES was begun. The additional terms were identified, generally in working groups of the DCMI, and judged by the DCMI Usage Board to be in conformance with principles of good practice for the qualification of Dublin Core metadata elements.
Element refinements make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific. A refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element, but with a more restricted scope. The guiding principle for the qualification of Dublin Core elements, colloquially known as the Dumb-Down Principle,[18] states that an application that does not understand a specific element refinement term should be able to ignore the qualifier and treat the metadata value as if it were an unqualified (broader) element. While this may result in some loss of specificity, the remaining element value (without the qualifier) should continue to be generally correct and useful for discovery.
In addition to element refinements, Qualified Dublin Core includes a set of recommended encoding schemes, designed to aid in the interpretation of an element value. These schemes include controlled vocabularies and formal notations or parsing rules. A value expressed using an encoding scheme may thus be a token selected from a controlled vocabulary (for example, a term from a classification system or set of subject headings) or a string formatted in accordance with a formal notation, for example, "2000-12-31" as the ISO standard expression of a date. If an encoding scheme is not understood by an application, the value may still be useful to a human reader.
Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder are elements, but not part of the Simple Dublin Core 15 elements. Use Audience, Provenance and RightsHolder only when using Qualified Dublin Core. DCMI also maintains a small, general vocabulary recommended for use within the element Type. This vocabulary currently consists of 12 terms.[15]
DCMI Metadata Terms [ edit ]
The DCMI Metadata Terms lists the current set of the Dublin Core vocabulary.[13] This set includes the fifteen terms of the DCMES (in italic), as well as the qualified terms. Each term has a unique URI in the namespace http://purl.org/dc/terms, and all are defined as RDF properties.

Syntax [ edit ]
Syntax choices for Dublin Core metadata depends on a number of variables, and "one size fits all" prescriptions rarely apply. When considering an appropriate syntax, it is important to note that Dublin Core concepts and semantics are designed to be syntax independent and are equally applicable in a variety of contexts, as long as the metadata is in a form suitable for interpretation both by machines and by human beings.
The Dublin Core Abstract Model[19] provides a reference model against which particular Dublin Core encoding guidelines can be compared, independent of any particular encoding syntax. Such a reference model allows implementers to gain a better understanding of the kinds of descriptions they are trying to encode and facilitates the development of better mappings and translations between different syntax.
Notable applications [ edit ]
One Document Type Definition based on Dublin Core is the Open Source Metadata Framework (OMF) specification.[20] OMF is in turn used by Rarian (superseding ScrollKeeper), which is used by the GNOME desktop and KDE help browsers and the ScrollServer documentation server. PBCore is also based on Dublin Core.[21] The Zope CMF's Metadata products, used by the Plone, ERP5, the Nuxeo CPS Content management systems, SimpleDL, and Fedora Commons also implement Dublin Core. The EPUB e-book format uses Dublin Core metadata in the OPF file.[22]

Last year, Richa Singh made history when she was appointed as the president of the Allahabad University's students' union - the first woman candidate since Independence. Since then, the path has been treacherous for her. Allahabad University has a strong presence of ABVP, and with important posts still held by the opposition party, Singh always believed the post of the president was a challenging one.
In November 2015, Yogi Adityanath, BJP's Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur was scheduled to inaugurate a new building at Allahabad University. But, because of his "controversial and communal" background, Singh along with her supporters launched a massive agitation to protest against Adityanath's entry into the university premises. According to Singh, that's where it all started.
"I was attacked the next day. Many men, mostly from ABVP, stormed into the hostels and started calling us names. The proctor was standing there frozen, watching the tamasha while ABVP went on verbally abusing us," Singh recalls.
Singh's admission letter.
After the incident, Singh wrote four letters to vice-chancellor RL Hangloo to probe the incident, but no action has been taken so far. But on March 4, Singh was shocked when she heard from news reports that the V-C has set up an internal committee to probe the validity of her admission in 2013-14 for no fault of hers, and that it could lead to her expulsion. "The university administration is continuously mentally harassing me. Since they have got nothing else, they are now questioning how I got admission in this university. My centre of studies is Institute of Inter Disciplinary Studies (IIDS), but they never consulted my dean. Cherry on the top, I haven't been even given a notice and it's flashing in every local newspaper," exclaims Singh.
Richa Singh's letter to MHRD.
According to Singh, the probe has been brought in by Rajnish Singh, an affiliate of ABVP union. "Our V-C never set up an internal enquiry on his own proctor. The proctor has been accused of IPC 354 but his position is still retained. The OSG of the university has a case of sexual harassment and Dalit atrocity registered against him, but he is safe. It's all about pushing me on the ground and ceasing my power," Singh adds.
Letter calling Richa Singh a Maoist - forwarded by AU V-C.
She has also accused the univeristy's V-C of forwarding a letter that claims she is a Maoist. The letter, originally written by another student, questions Singh's timing of entering and leaving the university's premises. The V-C, however, was unavailable for comment.
"I am afraid, after Hyderabad university, it's Allahabad University's turn. I can't even imagine how Rohit Vemula felt when he was thrown out of the university. The atrocities against students are on a rise and an incident like this shows how institutions are turning into authoritarian bodies," she adds.
Singh has already written a letter to MHRD and is awaiting response. Meanwhile, she is ready to counter the enquiry set up against her admission.
Saturday will be a day of firsts and lasts at BBVA Compass Stadium as the Dash host their inaugural Armed Forces Appreciation Night for the team's final home match of the season.
Dash reserve goalkeeper Haley Carter and her husband, Michael, were among the veterans honored for their service last month when the Dynamo held their annual evening paying tribute to members of the armed forces. When the Dash decided to organize their event initiative, Carter was a natural choice to be deeply involved.
The native Houstonian spent nearly eight years as an active duty Marine Corps officer, completing two deployments in Iraq and working on humanitarian missions in Asia. Now splitting her time between Houston and the family home near Austin, she trains with the Dash and runs the Epic90 goalkeeping academy.
“Brad and Tally honored my husband and I at halftime in Military Appreciation on July 4. After talking with the front office and Dynamo staff it was one of those things, like why don't we put something together like this for the Dash?” she told HoustonDashSoccer.com. “Houston is very good to its veterans … It's definitely one of those communities where people are really outspoken about supporting veterans.”
With more than 290,000 female veterans and service members in the greater Houston area, Saturday night's Haley's Heroes game against Sky Blue FC (8 p.m. CT; TICKETS) is an ideal chance to raise awareness and acknowledge the immense contributions made by women in the military.
“It's an opportunity to recognize female veterans,” Carter said, adding that women often perform behind-the-scenes work which is not always highly visible or dramatic but is vitally important and involves sacrifices such as spending long periods of time away from family, frequently in inhospitable parts of the world.
A number of donated tickets for Saturday's match will be available to armed forces members and ticket packages will include a partial donation to Banded Brigade Outdoors, the non-profit headed by Dynamo players Brad Davis and Tally Hall.
“I hope the fans really come out and show their appreciation for us and for the military and I'd love to see the crowd be like it was opening night with that excitement—it's the last chance to see us play this season,” Dash head coach Randy Waldrum told HoustonDashSoccer.com.
He paid tribute to the 30-year-old's work both in the Corps and for the Dash. “She's been an unbelievable ambassador for our team this year, been great in training, been a really good role model for all the players. Makes it hard for the players to complain about anything when they look at her,” he said. “We couldn't have a better ambassador.”
The Dash are hoping to end the week on a high after a 4-1 defeat on the road to Seattle Reign FC on Wednesday, mirroring the scoreline when the sides met in Houston a week earlier. This year's NWSL Shield champions—awarded to the team with the best regular season record—scored three times in nine minutes during the first half. They added a fourth courtesy of league MVP contender Kim Little soon after the hour mark, but a sharp close-range finish from substitute Nina Burger late on gave the visitors a consolation goal.
Waldrum said that for a young team still finding its feet in its debut NWSL season, Seattle represents a benchmark and their standard of play is something for the Dash to aspire to. “To come out and do it at 1-1 in the second half, at least we finished with some fight. The bottom line is they're just better right now, with better players with more experience at this level, and that's what we ran into,” he said. “There are a lot of lessons to be learned.”
For now, ahead of what's sure to be a busy offseason, the focus is on aiming to conclude the team's home fixtures with a win.

For the 795,000 Americans each year who suffer a stroke, a rapid response diagnostic test may soon be at hand.
Scientists at Cornell University's Baker Institute for Animal Health (BIAH) have created a system that can diagnose whether a stroke has taken place in less than 10 minutes using just a drop of blood—far quicker than the current means of testing, which relies on CT scans, full blood tests, and returns results in up to four hours. With every minute counting for sufferers of the condition, which costs the economy $34 billion annually, this new device could prove life changing.
Modern medicine's trend towards small size, simplicity, and speed is evident in this new diagnostic. “Three quarters of stroke patients suffer from ischemic stroke—a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain,” explains the study's lead author, Roy Cohen. “In those cases, time is of the essence, because there is a good drug available, but for a successful outcome it has to be given within three or four hours after the onset of symptoms. By the time someone identifies the symptoms, gets to the hospital, and sits in the emergency room you don't have much time to obtain the full benefit of this drug.”
Enabling quicker diagnosis could reduce the number of people who suffer lasting damage from ischemic strokes, he says—an important consideration given that they are one of the leading causes of long-term disability in the U.S.
Strokes, which kill an American once every four minutes, can also cause problems such as excessive tiredness and vision problems in the long term for those who survive. BIAH's technology will ultimately be able to detect biomarkers present in the blood when a stroke occurs by attaching enzymes to nanoparticles, which can convert those detected molecules into light.
Researchers focused on neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a biomarker found in more concentrated amounts in the blood of stroke victims, and measured the light they produced in order to diagnose whether this had taken place.
While recent developments in micro-medicine have seen the development of finger prick tests for everything from HIV to cancer, there is a brewing sense of distrust over the accuracy they provide. Following the recent Theranos controversy, in which the Silicon Valley lab's promises to diagnose a myriad health issues within a few hours with a drop of blood was found to have greatly over exaggerated its capabilities, skepticism around the accuracy of these rapid diagnostic tests is rife.
A new study also suggests that the contents of each individual droplet can vary widely, further calling into question whether this new mode of analysis is really the healthcare miracle it's been touted as. Research found that it was only when five or more pricks' worth had been expressed and combined that accurate results could be achieved.
For BIAH's stroke test, at least, demonstration of the proof of principle suggests that the technology could be employed to test further conditions in humans and animals, from heart disease to traumatic brain injuries. With Cohen currently analyzing the latter in mixed martial artists to “promising” results, this may be the device to prove critics wrong.
“This system could be tailored to detect multiple biomarkers,” says Alex Travis, the paper's co-author and Associate Professor of Reproductive Biology at BIAH. “That's the strength of the technique. You could assemble a microfluidic card based on this technology that could detect ten biomarkers in different wells, and the readout would be the same for each one: light.”
The team have plans to develop the stroke-detection technique for clinical testing with the help of a private company, with the test ultimately being made available in hospitals.
VIRGINIA BEACH — When a business owner realized his Mexican eatery wasn't turning as many tables as he'd like, he came up with a new concept.
Last weekend, restaurant co-owner Baxter Simmons closed Calliente Cantina, a brick and mortar at 918 Laskin Rd. known for its sugar skull artwork facing the road.
He opened the Mexican restaurant with his fraternity brothers, Ryan Houfek and John Peterson, last September — only to close it less than a year later.
At this point, three restaurants have shut down at the location near the Oceanfront since 2009, including burger joint The Purple Cow, Planet Pizza and Calliente Cantina as of June 4.
So, is this site cursed?
Simmons said it's all a part of the business when customers just don't bite.
“This spot has changed themes and restaurants over the years, and there's no reason something can't get in here and stick around for awhile,” Simmons said. “Sometimes you have to go through four or five different operations until you find the right fit for the right location.”
Simmons said opening Norfolk sandwich shop The 3Way Cafe is proof of his sentiment.
“It was half a dozen things before we put it in there and it's been there six years now,” Simmons said.
Now, he and his business partners are making room for something fresh — Americana Roadside Grill, with a menu focusing on burgers, barbecue, comfort food, brunch, alcoholic milkshakes and more.
“You kind of have to say ‘maybe this concept wasn't the best fit, but maybe this Americana thing will work,' and you give it a try and that's all we can do — hope people like the food and come on a regular basis,” Simmons said.
Americana will be the fourth restaurant to open in this space in the last eight years.
According to a city real estate assessment, the property value has received a steady value growth, increasing by about $98,000 since 2013. On the flip side, the structure worth has decreased in recent years, falling about $48,000 since 2013.
“The reality is this location has good traffic visibility, it's close to the Oceanfront for tourists, but we're also surrounded by a lot of neighborhoods here,” Simmons said. “If we can appeal to those neighborhoods and they come out and support it, we can stick around and make a go of it.”
David Edelin, who owns Eurasia Cafe across the street, said he's watched the building change themes over the ten years his business has operated.
“Honestly, I feel like the access road is a big issue because it's hard to get in there,” Edelin said. “You have to go up and make a U-turn to come in, you can't just turn in.”
Though Edelin said he's always had good experiences at Calliente Cantina, he believes it doesn't exactly look like a restaurant from the outside.
Mike Sconiers, franchise owner of Cal'z Pizza a few blocks away, said he's indifferent about the access roads that guide drivers to his business.
“Most of our business is delivery,” Sconiers said. “I don't know what the deal over there is. It's a bad luck spot I feel.”
Simmons says he started putting his Americana concept together about a month ago.
“I really like it, because I think we have aggressive price points. People can come in and enjoy and not spend a lot on dinner,” Simmons said.
“I think there's going to be enough variety on the menu that you can appeal to the guy getting off work who just wants some wings and chicken tenders to someone looking for a salad, some pimento cheese sliders or in-house sloppy joes.”
Simmons said local muralist Todd Alan Lindberg, who created the mural for Calliente Cantina, will paint something new for Americana Roadside Grill.
“We want it to be just something that's traditional American, a little bit on the patriotic side,” Simmons said.
In an effort to show appreciation and connect with the community, Simmons said his new restaurant will always offer 50 percent discounts to military members, veterans and first responders.
“It's a nice incentive,” Simmons said. “It helps fill up the seats, the servers stay busy and it helps create that vibe that you want. People like to go where other people are.”
Americana Roadside Grill plans to open for business Tuesday.

OMG, I can't believe all the hoopla about health care reform in the US. After nearly three weeks here, and talking with family and friends, I have come to the conclusion that no one really understands the issues (who would, the documents run in the thousands of pages). Opposition comes down to partisan politics and the fear of socialised medicine.
When I first moved to the UK nearly 20 years ago I was leary of the National Health Service (NHS) from years of right wing warning: It's government-run. It's inefficient. It's socialism, ferchristsake. You won't have access to good care.
You know what I've discovered after years of living abroad and extensive use of the NHS: The UK “socialised” system is not that bad. Really. In fact, I'm a huge fan.
Last year I found a lump in my breast. Sick with worry, I called my local doctor and got an appointment the same day. I was seen by a specialist within FIVE DAYS and was sent to have a scan and a mammogram. It all took about two hours. Luckily it turned out to be nothing.This was with the NHS socialised system. And then there was the time my GP that made a HOME VISIT to check on me after the birth of my first two children? And did I mention the same GP made another home visit to check on my 80-year-old mother-in-law with blood poisining?
I'm what you would call a health care “power” user, and have extensive experience of socialised and private health care on both sides of the pond. Pregnancy with severe pre-enclampsia, NICU babies, bowel surgery, you name it. With three children I've had to deal with stuffy noses, immunisations, sore throats, tubes and hearing problems and small fingers that have been banged in the door.
As usual it comes down to money: those with it can get whatever they want in either system. For example, if you want to jump the queue to see a specialist in the UK, you can buy insurance (which I don't have, BTW).
But with the NHS, EVERYONE has access: Poor people, old people, students, people who have lost their jobs. Not just the gainfully employed and those that can afford it.
Yes, it has a price tag (but you'll pay for it one way or another). And yes, things can go horribly wrong in BOTH systems. But it's nice to know that health care is there when you need it. It's also nice not to get a long, confusing bill.
So please, you nay-sayers, stop it about socialised medicine. You have no friggin idea what you are talking about. If you don't believe me, I can put you in touch with loads of British mothers that feel they get good care too. Really.
If you are a happy NHS customer, please leave a comment below and let everyone know what a good system it really is.

It would be laughable were it not so completely serious.
As I listened intently to Governor Romney's foreign policy address delivered this morning at the Virginia Military Institute, I was sure I heard him say that President Obama had not signed so much as one free-trade agreement during the past three years.
The statement struck such a discordant note I pressed the rewind button to make sure I had heard the Governor correctly.
Sure enough, that's what he said.
Apparently, the Romney campaign did not get the memo—or more likely chose to ignore the facts—that it was on October 23, 2011, not one year ago, when, in a rare moment of bi-partisanship, President Obama signed free-trade agreements with South Korea, Panama and Colombia.
Even the Republicans were happy about the event as Speaker of the House, John Boehner, issued a statement saying, "years of perseverance have been rewarded today as American job creators will have new opportunities to expand and hire as they access new markets abroad."
Why would Romney say such a thing when it is so obviously disprovable?
If you have the answer to that question, maybe you can then tell me why Mr. Romney would also include in his address a bold statement of commitment to a two state solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians, and the important role he could play in bringing about the same, when we all heard him say precisely the opposite in the now infamous “47 percent” videotape of his speech at a fundraiser in Boca Raton, Florida.
In case you need a reminder, here is what Romney said in that conversation which was intended to be private—
"I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and these thorny issues, and I say there's just no way. So what you do is, you say, you move things along the best way you can. You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem…and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it."
And yet, in today's speech, Gov. Romney said—
“Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew.”
Not only does Romney completely turn tail on what he expressed in private, he actually blames the President in today's speech for failing at something Romney is on record as saying is an unsolvable problem.
And maybe someone can tell me why Governor Romney chose to excoriate President Obama for not getting sufficiently involved in the internal skirmishes taking place in various Middle-Eastern countries when Romney went on record, in an April 2011 op-ed he penned for the National Review, and accused the President of being too aggressive in Libya by committing what he called ‘mission creep'?
Of course, it is possible Governor Romney simply forgot his most recent position on Libya given the number of times he changed his stance on that conflict.
In what might be considered a precursor to the now familiar Romney proclivity for "evolving" his stance to reflect what he thinks will best sell at any given moment, the Governor went through such a remarkable evolution during our efforts to assist the Libyans free themselves of the Gadhafi regime.
As Jake Tapper lays out in his October 20, 2011 piece on Romney's ever changing view of our involvement in Libya, Romney managed to work through three, distinct positions on the topic over a one month period. The first was expressed in March of 2011, when the Governor criticizes the Obama administration for being weak and not getting involved more quickly.
The second Romney position was no position at all, illustrated when, just one month following his initial take, Romney failed to even mention Libya during a speech delivered to the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas where the Governor criticized Obama's Middle-East policy. Having strangely omitted to discuss Libya during that speech, reporters sought to get the Governor to respond to questions on the topic. The encounter was described by the Las Vegas Review Journal as follows: “Romney was silent on Libya, the newest and stickiest military and U.S. policy problem as the United States and its NATO allies enforce a no-fly zone to help rebels oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. After his speech, Romney refused to take questions from reporters about his position on Libya. Instead, he and his wife, Ann, fled down a hallway and escaped up an escalator at The Venetian, where the event was held. ‘I've got a lot of positions on a lot of topics, but walking down the hall probably isn't the best place to describe all those,' Romney said, deflecting a Libya query as he walked quickly with half a dozen journalists trailing him.”
Finally, in the April op-ed Romney posted at Nationalreview.com, as noted and linked above, Romney wrote that he had, indeed, supported President Obama's “specific, limited mission” but went on to then criticize Obama for getting further involved in what Romney called “mission creep”.
So, in March, Romney deemed the American response to what was happening in Libya as weak only to evolve his message —just one month later—to one expressing initial support for the administration's limited mission and then criticized Obama for going too far.
Confused?
Get used to it. If there is one thing we know for sure, we will continue to have no idea of where Governor Romney really stands on both domestic and foreign issues because where he stands is a constantly moving target.

– Jim Rutherford, President and General Manager of the National Hockey League's Carolina Hurricanes, today announced that the team has agreed to terms with left wing Alexander Semin (SEH-min) on a five-year contract extension. The deal will pay Semin $7 million per season through 2017-18.
“We're very happy to retain Alex,” said Rutherford. “Alex is an elite player and has been a major contributor to the Hurricanes having a very strong top line.”
Semin, 29, is in his eighth NHL season and his first with Carolina, after signing as a free agent on July 26, 2012. The Krasnoyarsk, Russia, native leads the Hurricanes in assists (22), and ranks second in points (30) and plus/minus rating (+18) in 30 games this season. Semin (6'2”, 209 lbs.) is tied for 11th among all NHL skaters in assists this season, and tied for 10th in plus/minus rating. He ranks first among Hurricanes forwards in time on ice per game (20:39) and has spent the majority of the season skating alongside Hurricanes captain Eric Staal.
Semin has totaled 205 goals and 233 assists (438 points) in 499 career NHL games with the Washington Capitals and the Hurricanes. He netted his 200th career NHL goal on Feb. 11 against the New York Islanders. Washington's first-round selection, 13th overall, in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, Semin is fifth in the NHL in plus/minus over the last five seasons (+110), behind only Henrik Sedin, Zdeno Chara, Alexandre Burrows and Daniel Sedin.

The World Internet Conference has kicked off, taking place in China , which has brought many of the world's top technology companies together. At the beginning of the conference, Chinese officials called for controls on the internet in order to maintain stability. As an example, officials pointed to China's model for cyperspace regulation and how it can be attributed to helping create commercial successes such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd The conference will have sessions on global internet governance, mobile internet, and cybersecurity and is China's attempt to begin playing a larger role in the management of global cyberspce. Alibaba had a $25 billion listing in New York this year while, together, Tencent Holdings Ltd and Baidu Inc are worth more than $500 billion combined in market capitalization."We will strengthen communications and seek common ground while resolving differences to establish a multilateral, democratic and transparent international internet governance system," said Lu Wei, China's director of the State Internet Information Office, at the conference."Join us in building up a peaceful, safe and open and co-operative cyberspace."Aside from Chinese technology firms, other global companies such as Apple , Microsoft, and Amazon have sent representatives to attend the conference. Given that China boasts a population of 1.4 billion citizens, of which 632 million are online, makes China a very lucrative market that companies do not want to miss out on.One only has to look at the huge successes of China's own tech companies as a reason why global corporations are looking towards China.However, prior to the conference, China blocked access to a number of websites as part of a blunt censorship campaign according to an internet monitoring group.Edgecast, an affiliate of Verizon, said that its services were censored in a blog post that reads “We have been hearing from our CDN and Monitoring partners throughout the industry and our own customers that more sites, CDNs and networks are being filtered or blocked by the Great Firewall of China. This week we've seen the filtering escalate with an increasing number of popular web properties impacted and even one of our many domains being partially blocked… with no rhyme or reason as to why.”
The leader of the country's largest heads union has mounted a damning and wide-ranging attack on government education policy, warning that schools “will not endure another year of this chaos”.
National Association of Head Teachers' general secretary Russell Hobby today called for an end to key stage one statutory assessment and for ministers to "press the pause button" on academisation.
He described primary assessment as a ‘train wreck' and also cited recruitment problems and exam reform in a stinging condemnation of the government.
"Our patience has been taken for granted,” Mr Hobby told his association's annual conference in Birmingham this afternoon. “There is an anger and despair in schools beyond any I have seen before.”
He used his speech to attack the government for its "constant upheaval of assessment and top down reorganisation" and called for a “fundamental review” of assessment policy.
The attack could be particularly damaging for Nicky Morgan, education secretary – who was jeered at the conference yesterday - because it comes from a moderate union leader who ministers take seriously.
Mr Hobby told delegates that the government's changes had left assessment as "chaotic, confused, unreliable and largely meaningless"
"Changes are made at such a breakneck speed and at such volume that mistakes are inevitable," he said.
Yesterday, delegates voted for a review of assessment from the foundation stage through to secondary - and called for the government to abandon plans for year 7 resits.
Today Mr Hobby suggested a "return to the idea of a reception baseline" and a move away from "secure fit to best fit" for writing teacher assessment.
But he added: “We must ditch statutory assessment altogether at key stage one in through schools. We cannot have two high stakes tests for young children.”
"Even in the depths of our anger at our treatment, we remain constructive and positive but we will not stop until we've made the government see sense," Mr Hobby said.
And it is not only assessment that school leaders are angry about - yesterday headteachers voted to consider taking industrial action against forced academisation.
On the government's plans to turn all schools into academies by 2022, Mr Hobby said: "There is a reason why fifteen thousand schools have rejected academy status over many years, despite incentives and encouragement and even pressure.
"They don't believe it is right for them. It is odd to praise professional autonomy and then reject it in practice.
He added: "I am particularly dubious of this capacity at a time of stretched budgets. These are boom times for lawyers, auditors and consultants. Better if they were boom times for teachers."
The leader called on the government to "press the pause button" and not rush through top-down structural change.
“A department that cannot publish the right test paper on a website is not a department we can rely on to successfully convert fifteen thousand schools to academies in the next few years,” Mr Hobby warned. “These mistakes are not ‘human errors' but strategic errors of pace and engagement.”
He said: "When we criticise, it is because something is genuinely wrong. The sooner politicians learn to listen, the fewer mistakes they will make."

Because “no one should have to choose between paying a traffic ticket and feeding their family,” Rich Arp of San Francisco, California has started a new Change.org petition to make it so that people's traffic fines are based on their income.
For many lower income people a $375 traffic citation could mean a huge chunk of their monthly income, while that same ticket for a wealthier person is laughable. This means the deterrent and fine only affects the poor, undermining one of the most important tenets of our justice system. Let the punishment fit the crime. In many European countries traffic citation are tied to a person's income. These “day-fines” ensure that every person, whether rich or poor, feels the same punishment in the exact same way.
Arp does have a point. For some people, $375 is a week's income (or more) these days. Should something as low on the totem pole as a minor traffic infraction leave a person unable to pay their electric bill or feed their children? Who even comes up with these ticket amounts in the first place?
This doesn't even take into account what happens if the person can't pay the ticket and winds up in court with added court fees and additional fines.
Travel should be a right (unless we really are all slaves), but more and more travel by personal vehicle is being taxed and fined into oblivion. Once the new “track and tax” systems are in place nationwide, only people who want to be GPS tracked and pay for every mile driven (in addition to licensing fees, inspections, gas and gas taxes, insurance, and whatever fines or tickets the person gets plus the cost of the car itself and its maintenance) will drive. Everyone else will be forced to live in a large urban center where they can rely solely on public transportation … or a bicycle. (By the way, bicycle taxes are likely coming next…)
On the other hand, traffic tickets are just another form of extortion anyway. As Arp points out, “These fines have become ‘taxation by citation,' sometimes financing 90% of a town's budget and [incentivising] their police to write specious tickets.”
Hmm. Is that why we see police departments setting up crosswalk traps where a plainclothes officer will walk back and forth across a street multiple times in a row just to catch people not waiting and ticket them?
In Texas, for example, some tickets now magically come with added “surcharges” for “driver responsibility”… extra fines that amount to hundreds of dollars more than the ticket itself paid every year for three years to a private corporation because…? They can. If the person doesn't pay these extra tacked on fees, they are threatened with having their license suspended and their right to drive taken away completely. One is for not having insurance. If the person couldn't afford insurance to begin with, how are they going to afford the extra $750 in fees outside of the ticket for not having insurance? By the way, if the person is found to have had insurance at the time of the ticket and can prove they did but just couldn't find their card at the time of the traffic stop, they still have to pay the $750 surcharge.
So what do you think? Would tying ticket amounts to income at least be a step in the right direction?
Avoiding The Eye - Ships Free Today! Then again considering the way many departments finance themselves largely through ticketing, if this isn't capped in the other direction, we will likely see a shift to police mostly ticketing the owners of expensive vehicles to get the bigger fines… Of course, once computer-run “driverless” cars dominate the roads, this will all be a moot point anyway, and a lot of traffic cops will have to find something else to do with their time. Over 3,000 have signed Arp's petition so far. Melissa Dykes is a writer, researcher, and analyst for The Daily Sheeple and a co-creator of Truthstream Media with Aaron Dykes, a site that offers teleprompter-free, unscripted analysis of The Matrix we find ourselves living in. Melissa also co-founded Nutritional Anarchy with Daisy Luther of The Organic Prepper, a site focused on resistance through food self-sufficiency. Wake the flock up!
Texas school district will permit students to kneel during anthem
While some high schools and colleges across the U.S. are beginning to ban kneeling during the national anthem following the NFL protests from last weekend, the Frisco School District in Texas is tacitly encouraging students to protest (arguably even inviting them to do so).
In an email directive, Frisco Independent School District coaches have been told not to stop any students from kneeling. If students choose to kneel before the game, “they may do so without repercussion,” states a copy of the note provided to CR by a member of the Frisco ISD community.
The note was signed by a Frisco ISD communications representative.
The directive was issued in response to an inquiry from Frisco ISD coaches. According to WFAA-TV, the school said it “did not create a district policy, and did not impose or suggest consequences for any students or staff for expressing an opinion on the merits of standing, sitting, kneeling, or locking arms during the national anthem.”
Frisco ISD says students choosing to kneel during anthem may do so without repercussion: pic.twitter.com/ZH421k1MLf — WFAA-TV (@wfaachannel8) September 28, 2017
The point of this letter is ostensibly to provide “guidance” to school coaches, to help navigate around potential trouble. Its defenders will claim the district is in no way encouraging students to protest the national anthem.
But what is the purpose of sending this directive where there were no indication students were planning a protest? In sending this letter (which countless coaches have undoubtedly shared with their teams), the school preemptively declared there will be no consequences for a protest that wasn't happening. By doing this, the school is actually inviting such a protest.
It's like saying, “By the way, kids, if you want to protest during the anthem, you won't be punished.” “We aren't protesting.” “OK, but if you do, we won't punish you.”
Don't be surprised if Frisco ISD athletes start kneeling during the national anthem now that the school essentially gave them the all-clear.

The terrorists first murdered the female journalist Ruqia Hassan and then hacked her Facebook account to spy on her contacts.
The terrorist from Daesh/ISIS terrorist hacked into the Facebook account of a female journalist (Ruqia Hassan) whose execution was kept secret by the group for 3 months to gain information on her friends and colleague through her social media account.
Ruqia was executed because the militant group claimed she was working as an agent for the Free Syrian Army FSA (A rebel group). Her execution was confirmed by Mr. Abu Mohammed, founder of an anti-ISIS and anti-Assad group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. However, the terrorist group was successful in gathering information on her Friends, colleagues and other journalists working with her.

The city of Ruqqa has been used by the militant group for carrying out all these executions which include anyone who goes against their rulings or tries to act as a spy.
[fullsquaread][/fullsquaread]
Ruqia studied philosophy at the University of Aleppo and supported the opposition of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
When the militant group took over the city of Raqqa, she started uploading status and pictures related to the problems and daily routines of the militant rules. When ISIS tried to ban WiFi in the region, Ruqia tried the dark humor on the Facebook by posting message such as this:
“Go ahead and cut off the Internet, our messenger pigeons won't complain.”
Her Facebook account went quite on July 21 and Ruqia was captured in August. After keeping her for some time, the militant group executed her.
Her Facebook account became active just last week when her friends and colleagues began receiving messages from her, according to The Independent.
RIP brave lady.
Boko Haram fighters have amassed in the group's Sambisa Forest stronghold in northeast Nigeria, as a military offensive tries to flush them out, a civilian vigilante told AFP on Thursday.
But soldiers were forced to retreat because of the extensive use of landmines in the area, one of which exploded killing a soldier and three vigilantes.
"Boko Haram are in large numbers in Sambisa," said the vigilante, who requested anonymity for security reasons as he was part of the operation.
"All their fighters who were pushed out of Bama, Dikwa, Gwoza and Damboa (in Borno state) all moved to Boko Haram camps in Sambisa," he added.
Details of the offensive came as a series of photographs circulated on social media accounts linked to the Islamic State group of heavily armed fighters, purportedly from Boko Haram.
No independent verification was possible but some of the accounts said the images were released under the name "The Islamic State in West Africa".
Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau pledged allegiance to IS group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in March. The Middle Eastern militants responded by urging Muslims to support the rebels in Nigeria.
A four-nation military operation launched in February involving Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon has recaptured swathes of territory previously held by Boko Haram in three northeast states.

Last week, Nigeria's national security advisor Sambo Dasuki said troops would storm the vast Sambisa Forest by the handover of power to incoming president Muhammadu Buhari on May 29.
It has been claimed that the 219 schoolgirls kidnapped last April from the town of Chibok 80 kilometres (50 miles) away were being held in the area.
Others have said they may have been split up and could be in Cameroon, Chad or elsewhere in northern Nigeria.
- 'Defying obstacles' -
On Wednesday, the military said an offensive was under way "in some forest locations", claiming to have killed a senior commander as well as a number of militants who attacked a patrol.
"The operations especially in forest locations are progressing in defiance of obstacles and landmines emplaced by the terrorists," defence spokesman Chris Olukolade said in a statement.
But the vigilante said progress over the last three days had been severely hindered.
"Boko Haram have buried landmines all over the routes leading to their camps in the forest, which is no doubt a huge obstacle retarding the military offensive against them," he said.
Troops were forced to turn back just five kilometres (three miles) from Boko Haram's main camp because of landmines.
One soldier and three vigilantes were killed when their vehicle hit a mine, he said.
"There are no soldiers in Sambisa right now. We all returned to Bama after the horrifying experience of manoeuvring through minefields," he added.
Sharing is Caring
“INVENTIONS…..” sounds tough and not easy to go with. As soon as this word comes to our mind ,we start thinking of several sleepless nights of hardwork , innovation , intelligence and the list goes on.But often inventions and discoveries were the result of an accident or twist that took place without notice and some were meant to do so. Long ago at about 212 BC Archimedes Principle was discovered by accident. Archimedes who lived on the island of Sicily was once called by his king and asked to check the purity of gold in his crown. He worked on the problem for days but could not find a solution. One afternoon he stepped into a bathtub full of water and watched as the water overflowed. He realized that the amount of water that was displaced from the bathtub was equal to the volume of his body as it entered the water. EUREKA !
This was the answer to his problem! He did the same for the crown and thus came to a conclusion , leading to the discovery of the Law of Buoyancy . Similarly the discovery of Gravity was known to occur due to the falling of an apple by Isaac Newton . In 1826 Jhon Walker invented friction matches in his way to remove a chemical mixture from his stirring stick by scraping it against stone.
The 20th Century involved many inventions and discoveries that reformed us , our lifestyles and the entire system of the world. These inventions included different electronic gadgets, tools, automobiles etc There came a significant rise in the field of science and technology with the advent of 20th century. These inventions gave a new perception to life, enabling people to lead a more convenient lifestyle. At the beginning of this century , the air and land were conquers with such inventions as the airplane , radio and the automobile. These tender inventions quickly evolved into supersonic flight, wireless internet, alternative fuel and electric vehicles. Some great inventions of the 20th century are given below.
The AIRPLANE
Initially, human power tried to achieve bird like flight, but materials in the early days were just too heavy . Over the years, more powerful, light and reliable engines were created as well as single fixed wing airplane was designed.
The airplane was invented by the Wright brothers , Orville and Wilbur in 1903. Their first successful airplane flew for only 12 seconds and only made it 10 feet off the ground , but this flight revolutionized travel for the world.Within 15 years conventional flights became viable to people in 1940. Since then airplanes have become more developed and used by thousands of people everyday, thanks to the Wright brothers.
The TELEVISION
The first Television in the broadcast media came out in 1923 and the inventors were Philo Farnsworth and Vladmir Zworykin. It changed the way we receive information and entertainment by providing a visual format to the sound.The initial televisions were black and white but by 1950 it became available in colour.As the years passed television developed to what it is now.
The AUTOMOBILES
One of the most popular mode of transportation was the Dailmer Motoren Gesellschaft(DMG) . It was invented by Daimler and Mabach in 1892.Without these we will still be using the horse and carriage. Designs to build the car were greatly improved just the things you see on the road nowdays.The downside though is that we have become dependent on them which is affecting the Earth and our systems badly. One of its adverse effect includes the green house effect leading to Global Warming.
NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
Nuclear technology was first discovered as radioactivity in 1869. It showed its adverse effect during the nuclear bombing in the Japenese city Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The first nuclear weapon was not used until 1945. In the 1950's nuclear reactors started to be used as sources of energy.
LIQUID FUEL ROCKET
The first flight of a liquid fuel rocket occurred on March 16, 1926 which was powered by liquid oxygen and gasoline American professor Robert H.
Goddard launched it and it rose 41 feet and flew for 2.5 seconds. It demonstrated that liquid fuel rockets were possible, eventually leading to Sputnik and the Moon
CELLPHONE
These were first released in Japan around the 1980s.Originaly they were large bulky things and designed as walky talkies.But since then they have been constantly being upgraded to the devices we use now. The first mobile phone was invented in 1973 by Motorola .It was too expensive for many people to purchase. It was not until the mid 1990's that people started using mobile phones.
INTERNET
FIBRE OPTICS is said to be the backbone of communication initially developed in 1966. It largely allowed the Internet revolution to happen. Internet was designed in 1973 and it revolutionized the sharing of information among people globaly.It also leads to the free transfer of data across networks through emails . Internet is said to reside in almost every house .It has greatly influenced the youth to such an extent that they can stay without food but not without internet connection.
PERSONAL COMPUTER
One of the major invention was that of the PERSONAL COMPUTER which brought a great revolution in the world.In 1981 personal computers came into exsistence with a screen ,keyboard and memory disk by IBM. The IBM 5100 was the first laptop or portable computer released on September 1975. Gradually this field showed great enhancement to technology giving birth to the new concept of handy devices.
After such long dose of high knowledge and innovations let us now look at some of the facts about inventions.
The telescope was accidentally discovered in 1698 when Dutch eye glassmaker Hans Lippershey looked through two lenses – one held in front of the other – and realized that the image was magnified.
J.B. Dunlop, inventor of the pneumatic tire, was a veterinary surgeon.
The trademarked name “Baby Ruth” of the American candy bar was inspired by President Grover Cleveland's daughter, Ruth, and not by Babe Ruth.
The first rickshaw was invented in 1869 by an American Baptist minister, the Rev. E. Jonathan Scobie, to transport his disabled wife around the streets of Yokohama.
The Band-Aid Bandage was invented by a Johnson & Johnson employee whose wife had cut herself. Earl Dickson's wife was rather accident prone, so he set out to develop a bandage that she could apply without help.
It was melting ice cream that inspired the invention of the outboard motor.
A major cause for inventions is human's anxiety to know and learn. Questions like WHAT? HOW? WHY? lead to discoveries and inventions which not only affects our life but also give reasons to nature. As centuries pass we will further come across some surprising discoveries and inventions.

The Washington Capitals were officially eliminated from the playoffs last week, something few fans and analysts anticipated at the start of the season.
By failing to reach the postseason for the first time since 2007, the Caps were clearly one of the more disappointing teams this season. This is part two of a three-part series looking into what went wrong for the Caps. Last week, we looked at general manager George McPhee.
This week, we'll look at the man behind the bench, Adam Oates.
One reason why this season was such a disappointment is because of the success Oates had in his first season as coach. After a 2-8-1 start to the lockout shortened 2012-13 season, the Caps rallied to win the Southeast Division and make their sixth consecutive postseason.
This was especially impressive given the fact that Oates did not have the time in the offseason or a camp to instill his new system and coaching style with the team; he had to take control on the fly and the team responded.
Oates' initial success made everyone believe the team would thrive in his second year with a full offseason.
That didn't happen.
So a first-year head coach was able to take over an NHL team with no offseason and lead them to the playoffs, but in his second season the team flounder even with a normal offseason schedule. Doesn't that seem backwards to you?
Indeed Oates took a huge step back this year with baffling personnel decisions, a stubbornness to change or acknowledge those things that weren't working and his complete inability to give this team any sort of identity.
Oates got things started early in the season with his handling of Tom Wilson.
Wilson averaged less than eight minutes a game even though McPhee made clear at the beginning of the season that he wanted him to receive significant minutes. About the only thing Wilson has been allowed to do this season is fight.
Part of the reason he was brought to the NHL was to protect him from players targeting him in the OHL to make a name for themselves. Luckily Oates was there to protect him from those 18 and 19 year olds by throwing him to the wolves in the NHL.
If we are going to talk about personnel, we have to talk about Jay Beagle.
Perhaps the most curious move Oates made this season was moving Beagle to the top line to play with Alex Ovechkin at a time when the team was in desperate need of points.
Just one year ago, Oates stuck Ovechkin with Beagle and Joey Crabb when Ovechkin wanted to move back to left wing. It was a not-so-subtle hint to Ovechkin that if he did not commit to the switch to right wing, he would be stuck with a line he could not produce with.
In one year Beagle went from a ‘punishment' center to the actual top center. Take a guess as to how well that move worked.
Ovechkin's line was allowing more goals than it was producing and Oates added Beagle, a more defensively responsible forward, to the top line in an effort to fix the problem.
Dale Hunter's solution for this was to simply bench Ovechkin, so I applaud Oates' effort to find a more viable solution, but this move was doomed from the start.
Beagle is a ‘defensively responsible' forward because he can't produce offensively. At all. His career high in points is nine, set this season. Even though he played more games this season (62) than he has in any other season in his career and spent time playing with the best scorer in the world, he still managed only nine points.
What really bothers me about this move other than the fact that it didn't work was that it vilified both Beagle and Ovechkin. Beagle is everything you want in a fourth line player; he works hard, he has an imposing frame which he's not afraid to use, but he is a horrendous option for the top line. Continually throwing him on the top line where he doesn't belong exposes his flaws and does not endear him to the fans. He does his job well, but by asking him to do more than he is capable of Oates made Beagle look and feel like a detriment to the team. That's not fair and it's not right.
Ovechkin also came under intense scrutiny in the back half of the season as his plus-minus continued to drop, but he can't improve his plus-minus if he's skating with someone who can't produce offensively.
Did the top line allow as many goals with Beagle? No, but they didn't score any either.
Ovechkin did not score a single point while skating with Beagle. Instead of allowing more goals than they were scoring, the top line just stopped scoring.
And yet Oates would not back down. This experiment should have lasted only a few games, but it went on for two weeks. When asked, what did Oates have to say? “I thought that line hasn't hurt us.”
What team was he watching?
It was this kind of stubborn refusal to acknowledge any of his team's struggles or make necessary changes that made this season so frustrating.
The team needed a top six forward and Oates kept Martin Erat on the fourth line until he was traded. The roster is very weak on the left side, but Oates put Dustin Penner on the fourth line after the team traded for him. Oates kept Dmitry Orlov cycling back and forth between Washington and Hershey so many times that he demanded a trade. Oates rode Philipp Grubauer into the ground and refused to play Michal Neuvirth even though that was the only way to raise his trade value. Oates continually played Brooks Laich and Troy Brouwer on a line despite the fact that they are two players with two similar playing styles and did not produce offensively together.
McPhee's hands were also tied in terms of building a roster given Oates' insistence on playing each player on their shooting side, thus limiting McPhee's options. Even when he did bring in players that seemingly fit what the team needed, Oates refused to use them.
McPhee may be at fault for not bringing in players that Oates would want to use, but Oates is at fault for not utilizing an optimal lineup.
You can't convince me that it is better for the team to have Beagle on the top line and Erat and Penner on the fourth. I can't quantify what giving players like Erat and Penner more time would mean in terms of the standings, but the Caps ended up only three points behind Detroit for the final wildcard spot. Keeping good players on the bench for much of the year could very well have been the difference between a playoff berth and an early summer vacation.
The only way Oates could have justified his puzzling line combinations would be if these players better fit the team's identity, but there's a major problem with that argument: the team doesn't have an identity.
Can anyone tell me what this team's identity is? Are they a run-and-gun offense? A defensive stalwart? Grinders and hard-workers? A trap team? A two-way team? Opportunistic? They are none of these.
The fact is even after 82 games I don't know what they are.
The ultimate failure of Oates this season is that he was never able to instill an identity into the team, unless you believe that identity was bad-turnovers leading to odd man rushes and a complete reliance on the power play. Given that this isn't Oates' first season with the team, that is a particularly egregious failure.
The only way you could characterize the Caps this season is by what they did poorly. They could not hold on to two-goal leads, constantly allowed goals after scoring, could not score at even strength, and literally could not win without scoring three goals or more, going 0-25-7 when scoring two goals or fewer.
These are mental and systematic mistakes that all reflect on the coaching.
Given the roster Oates was handed to start the season, the Caps should be in the playoffs. Is it a championship caliber roster? No, it had some holes, but it was better than how they played.
Oates is a great assistant coach, but that may be his ceiling. He was hired because he was the architect of New Jersey's power play and had ideas on how to resurrect Ovechkin's offensive prowess. He accomplished both feats and put together a productive third line, but he did little else.
Ovechkin, Brouwer Jason Chimera and Joel Ward all had great offensive numbers under Oates' tutelage. Ovechkin even led the league with 51 goals this season.
Before you hail Oates as an offensive genius, however, consider this: 24 of Ovechkin's 51 goals were scored on the power play where he continues to play on the left side. Nearly half of his goals came on the side Oates moved Ovechkin away from.
Oates didn't fix Ovechkin, he fixed the power play.
Oates can believe in whatever theories or ideas he wants, but the results from his first full season as a head coach have been downright awful. He is the definition of a meddling coach, tweaking everything from playing side, stick curves and even goaltending style. When things went bad this season he blamed everyone else throwing players like Ovechkin and Jaroslav Halak under the bus all while sticking to his guns on the questionable decisions he himself had made.
In his first season, Oates showed Caps fans a lot to be hopeful for, but that was just not the case in year two.
Next week, I'll take a look at the players to see what went wrong on the ice.
Detailing the Charlotte Hornets future salary cap flexibility and path to maintaining a roster with playoff potential.
This summer the Hornets made a series of moves to maintain contenders for a mid-tier seed in the Eastern Conference in acquiring Dwight Howard, and one of the steals of draft night in adding dynamic shooter from Kentucky, Malik Monk. In free agency, the front office worked quickly in adding backup point guard Michael Carter Williams by using part of their Mid-Level Exception. In this piece, I assess the team's future and options the front office has for crafting a roster that can continue to contend for a playoff seed in the east.
Offseason Moves
The first major move of the Hornets offseason was the acquisition of Dwight Howard. The Hornets sent Miles Plumlee and his $12.5 Million through 2020 and Marco Belinelli and his deal through 2017-18 worth just a hair above $6.6 Million. This move was practically a swapping of bad contracts, Howard's being one year less than Plumlee's, and a filler to balance out the salaries of the deal. For the Hornets, it clears up cap space ($12.5 Million) in the 2019 offseason when Kemba Walker becomes an unrestricted free agent for the first time in his career.
The addition of Michael Carter Williams on a one year deal obviously doesn't hamper future flexibility. It did eat away at some of the Hornets Mid-Level Exception (MLE) along with the $815,615 rookie minimum given to Dwayne Bacon after a strong summer league performance. Under the CBA, second round picks must be signed using the teams' cap space or an available exception. Teams will often use part of an exception on a three-year deal rather than a two-year minimum due to the fact that the team will have the player's bird rights at the end of the three-year deal. Bacon's deal is structured as a three-year deal, the second year non-guaranteed, with a team option for the third year. This sets up Bacon to head into restricted free agency in the summer of 2020.
The rest of the 2017 offseason includes decisions by August 1st on whether to guarantee Johnny O'Bryant and Briante Weber's contracts for the 2017-18. Both contracts are for the minimum and if both are guaranteed will be off the books after the 2017-18 season. If both contracts are picked up the team will remain under the luxury tax, this would also fill the roster to 14 players allowing one more NBA contract and two more Two-Way contract slots available. Treveon Graham also has a guaranteed date during the 2017-18 season on January 10th. The Hornets still have the full Bi-Annual exception worth $3,290,000 to spend the rest of free agency.
Future Off-seasons
The summer of 2018 brings another offseason where the Hornets are over the salary cap. With salaries totaling $116,377,233, if the team option of Frank Kaminsky, $3,627,824, is exercised, and if Bacon's salary of $1,378,242 is kept on the books. The team will have Graham (if retained) and Weber (if retained) as restricted free agents and Michael Carter-Williams along with O'Bryant (if retained) as unrestricted free agents. There is not a clear route to improving the team through free agency next summer with the limited flexibility the Hornets have.
The offseason of 2019 is when things get very interesting for the Hornets. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist has a player option of $13 million along with Marvin Williams and his player option of $15,006,250. The team holds options Malik Monk's $4,028,400 salary and Bacon's $1,618,520. The contracts of Kemba Walker and Dwight Howard will both come off the books in 2019. If both Kidd-Gilchrist and Williams both opt-out (which I find unlikely) the Hornets will only have $45,684,047 in committed salaries for the 2019-20 season. This would give them the flexibility, with $61,415,953 in ideal space (cap holds renounced), to retain Walker while also adding another top tier free agent.
The more probable scenario remains that Kidd-Gilchrist and Williams both opt-in to their contracts and the Hornets have around $33 million in space to resign Walker adds another piece to make the roster enticing enough for him to stay.
It is not even worth discussing off-season's past 2019 because of the radically different direction the Hornets could be heading in following the decision by Walker in free agency.
Recap
Obviously in the NBA things can change overnight and teams are very leery of letting stars walk in an unrestricted free agency for nothing. The Hornets will have big decisions on the path to Walker's decision in the summer of 2019.
The roster as constructed for the next two seasons should allow the team to compete for a playoff spot in the weakened eastern conference, but past then it is impossible to project what a Hornets roster could look like.

PCB bars players from playing Afghanistan T20 league

Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan continued to sour after the Pakistan Cricket Board on Friday (June 2) barred its players and officials from participating in the Afghanistan T20 league. The decision comes a day after the Afghanistan Cricket Board cut ties with Pakistan following a bomb blast in Kabul on Wednesday that killed more than 80 people.
Umar Akmal, Kamran Akmal, Babar Azam, Sohail Tanvir and Rumman Raees were all bought by the franchises in the auction but they will have to be replaced now with PCB refusing to hand NOCs to the players.
Last week, the two boards had a fruitful meeting in Lahore and had agreed to resume ties by playing two T20 friendly matches, with one of the games scheduled to be held in Kabul. But following the blast, the ACB came out with a strongly-worded statement in which it labelled Pakistan "a country where terrorists are housed and provided safe haven."
PCB, as expected, was miffed with ACB's reaction. "The informal understanding with ACB last weekend was strictly subject to conducive security conditions in Afghanistan and now stands cancelled because of continuing insecurity and instability there. It is also deeply regrettable that the ACB delegation in Pakistan was at pains to insist that politics should not impinge on cricket but has now turned around and is playing politics by laying the blame for its troubles and inadequacies on Pakistan,"

PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Taking down statues of Confederate figures is ‘‘just like'' removing a monument to victims of the 9/11 attacks, Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday, adding that the white nationalist and far-left protesters in Charlottesville over the weekend were ‘‘equally bad'' and ‘‘disgusting.''
The Republican governor made the comments during an appearance on WGAN-AM when asked for his reaction to the deadly violence in Virginia at a white nationalist protest over the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
LePage, echoing President Donald Trump, said he condemns ‘‘both sides'' that went to the city with the intent of inciting violence. He lamented the deaths of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was struck by a car that drove into the crowd of protesters, and two state police officers, whose helicopter crashed during an effort to contain the violence.

LePage said left-wing protesters who want to remove Confederate statues are ignorant of history and want to erase it. He compared them to ‘‘the Taliban in Afghanistan'' in their desire to remove monuments.

‘‘How can future generations learn if we're going to erase history? That's disgusting,'' he said. ‘‘They should study their history — they don't even know the history of this country and they are trying to take monuments down. Listen, whether we like it or not, this is what our history is.''
He continued: ‘‘To me, it's just like going to New York City right now and taking down the monument of those who perished in 9/11. It will come to that.''
LePage also said he didn't find out about the Charlottesville violence until Tuesday because he doesn't watch TV or read newspapers. The governor, who has a long history of feuding with the media, said he thinks newspapers are ‘‘pencil terrorists.''
Former Maine Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, also appeared on WGAN on Thursday morning to address the Charlottesville violence. He said that Trump's role as president is to ‘‘comfort the country'' and that the president's comments were ‘‘tone deaf.'' Baldacci didn't directly address LePage's comments.
The squad has bought two 208s developed and raced by Team Peugeot-Hansen for World RX in 2015, with which Timmy Hansen and Davy Jeanney claimed event wins for the outfit and also secured the Teams' title.
Kevin Hansen also used the same specification of car to dominate the European Rallycross Championship last season.
No driver confirmations have been made in the announcement, but Motorsport.com expects the team's current lead driver, Jean-Baptiste Dubourg to remain with the team.
“At the end of 2016, we had the opportunity to acquire two of the best cars in the discipline, and with the objective of growth for DA Racing, we could not miss this opportunity,” said team owner Dominique Dubourg.
“The arrival of two Peugeot 208 WRX Supercars in our premises allows us to prepare in the best conditions for our participation in the World Championship.
"It is very important for DA Racing to move up with the best assets at all levels. We have just started the first part with the acquisition of the two Peugeots, and will continue our approach by going into a phase of recruitment on all floors, for drivers, technical staff and management.”
DA Racing competes in rallycross and the Andros Trophy winter ice racing series (where it is reigning champion with Jean-Baptiste Dubourg) and ran an ice racing machine for Haas Formula 1 driver Romain Grosjean to secure victory at the Alpe D'Huez round recently.
The squad has also tasted success in World RX. Racing an ex-Jeanney Citroen C4 in 2015, Dubourg finished on the podium at his home round at Loheac as part of selected appearances.
The car was replaced for 2016 with a brand new Citroen DS3, but technical troubles ruled the team out of challenging in a European Championship campaign.
“In 2016 we decided to build the DS3 for the European Championship and after a difficult start and hard work from the whole team, we recorded a very promising level of performance, which is encouraging for the future,” said Dominique Dubourg.
“The ambition of DA Racing is simple, we want to compete for first place in the different championships we are engaged in.”
The team is expected to also run the DS3 in 2017. Last season, Andrea Dubourg raced the car in French Rallycross Championship and won events, alongside appearances in a Super1600 category of the European series. An option for the squad could be that he gradates to Euro RX this year.
It seems like every major newspaper and magazine is featuring veganism lately.
Newsweek ran an article on vegan CEOs. The Wall Street Journal talked about almond milk. If periodicals with readerships in the millions are talking about veggies regularly, we must be on our way to world where more meals eaten by the majority of people are plant-based.
Recently, WSJ ran an article called “Meet the Meaty Veggies,” where it discusses how popular chefs like Blue Hill's Dan Barber cook up veggies for herbivores and meat eaters alike.
Barber isn't too creative about naming some of his vegetarian meals; he simply calls it “steak” but puts a vegetable in its place.
Thankfully, the meal itself is far from bland, tastefully or nutritionally.
The cauliflower steak is served over a bed of quinoa and sauteed zucchini. The sauce for the “steak” consists of a mixture a shallot, leaks, garlic cloves and apples.
The gluten-free, grainy-like quinoa is not only a tasty high-protein staple for a vegetarian diet, it's also a great source of magnesium and iron.

Oprah Winfrey announced on her live show Friday that she took advantage of Illinois' early-voting laws and voted Thursday in Chicago - but not without a voting booth scare and near emotional meltdown.
"I was worried that there's gonna be such long lines, and I have a live show," Winfrey said, justifying her decision to vote early.
She waited 72 minutes to vote, only to have a near-meltdown in the booth.
"When I voted yesterday electronically, the first vote that you vote for on the ballot is the presidential candidate. It was my first time doing electronic, so I didn't mark the X strong enough, or I held down too long. Because then when I went back to check it, it had not recorded my presidential vote," she said.
She then simulated her meltdown, shaking and breathing heavily while stuttering out the words, "It didn't record my presidential vote."
Watch, and heed Oprah's advice to double-check that your vote is recorded:
Suppose, hypothetically, that you are creating a web application. Let's even suppose that it's a very small and simple one, almost an embarrassingly small one. As part of this app, you need a very little bit of something like a templating system. Not much, just a bit more than printing formatted strings. Clearly you have such a trivial situation that you can just bang together a tiny and simple mini-templating language, right?
Let me save you some time and effort: no. Don't do it. The reality is that we've reached a point in time where writing your own (web) templating language or system is basically guaranteed to be a mistake. I know, you have a trivial application and you don't want to take an external dependency, you hardly need anything, all of the existing templating systems are wrong or too heavyweight, there's a whole list of excuses. Don't accept them. Suck it up, take an external dependency, and use an existing templating system even if it's vast overkill for your problem. Your future self will thank you in a few years.
(I could almost go further than this and maybe I should, but that's another entry.)
All of this especially applies if you have an application that's needs more than a trivial templating system; I picked an extreme case because it's where the temptation can be strongest. Writing your own non-tiny templating system today is an especially masochistic exercise because even a basic one is a bunch of work and raises a moderate ton of questions that you're ill-equipped to answer (or even recognize) unless this is not your first templating system.
In hindsight, writing my own 'simple' templating system was one of the mistakes I made when I wrote DWiki (the code that powers Wandering Thoughts). It's been a very educational mistake, but unless you really want to do things the hard way for the experience I can't recommend it.
(Note that rolling your own is not a great learning experience unless you live with the result for a number of years, so that you have plenty of time to run into the lurking problems. Almost anything can look good if you write it, use it briefly, and then abandon it. Many of my painful lessons took years to smack me in the face.)
PS: This assumes that you aren't working in a new language where no one's written a decent templating system. If you are, I think that you should at least steal one of the battle-tested designs from good templating systems in other languages.
(Also, yes, a very few people have very special needs and have to write their own systems. They know who they are.)
Bangladesh reported an outbreak of the highly contagious H5N1 bird flu virus at a poultry farm in Dhaka, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) said on Monday, citing a report from the Bangladeshi agriculture ministry.
Of 3,000 Sonali type poultry at risk from the outbreak, 732 died from the virus and the rest were slaughtered, according to the report posted by the Paris-based OIE.
The farm was located in Dhamrai, a division of the capital city of Dhaka, the report said.
Different strains of bird flu have been spreading across Europe and Asia since late last year, leading to mass culling of poultry in certain countries and some human deaths in China.
This prompted the World Health Organization to call on all countries on Monday to monitor closely outbreaks of the deadly virus in birds and poultry and to report promptly any human cases that could signal the start of a flu pandemic.
In a column today for Brietbart News, Concerned Women for American President Penny Nance joins the right-wing detractors of the anti-bullying Day of Silence, telling parents that the event sponsored by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) is in fact a tool for LGBT activists who “are going around you to get to your children.”
Nance insists that GLSEN is “working tirelessly to infiltrate schools and influence children across the country” and “taunting and bullying kids in public school and shaming them regarding their religious beliefs that favor traditional marriage.”
What if I told you that pro-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) activists are working tirelessly to infiltrate schools and influence children across the country? What if I said activists were taunting and bullying kids in public school and shaming them regarding their religious beliefs that favor traditional marriage? Most parents do not want to hear this, but it is a reality they must face. Gay activist are going around you to get to your children, and schools are complicit.
The “Day of Silence,” to be held next Friday, April 17, is part of that effort. It is a project of the radical Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), which is the leading pro-LGBT national education organization working inside schools in all 50 states.
…
Here's an idea: how about GLSEN doing an effort against bullying, period? We could all get behind that. I despise children being bullied for being “gay” just as much as for being obese or for being from another country, or simply being different or for whatever reason. How about we teach our kids, “Be ye kind one to another.”
But these activists are not interested in stopping bullying — they actually want to bully anyone who dares oppose their opinion, as we have seen. The Day of Silence is an opportunity to make sure any other view is completely silenced.
They would use different language, to be sure. They would say they are combating “homophobia.” But they consider traditional Christian teaching to be homophobic, and, therefore, if your child is a Christian, they will be under enormous pressure to ignore their faith in this area or risk intense ridicule and contempt (or, dare we say, hatred).
The most dangerous thing about all this is that schools are complicit in disallowing debate. This is why no parent will be notified of this day or most other pro-LGBT activities in advance. The educational institutions are so politicized that they will and must abide by political correctness at all times.
That is one of the many reasons why parents must stay informed and involved in their children's education. There is an effort to combat the Day of Silence called the “‘Day of Silence' Walk Out” where parents are encouraged to keep their children home. Most parents don't know about it, so we must spread the word. Only by staying involved will we be able to combat these efforts and train our kids to navigate the turbulent waters of today's increasingly secularized, hostile culture.

In a Journal, Environmental Health Perspectives, an international team led by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the Chernobyl Research Unit at the Radiation Epidemiology Branch of the National Cancer Institute describes the increased risks of leukemia among these workers between 1986 and 2006.The risk included a greater-than-expected number of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which many experts did not consider to be associated with radiation exposure in the past.The new study, including 110,645 workers, is the largest and longest study to date involving Chernobyl cleanup workers who worked at or near the nuclear complex in the aftermath of the accident.The team of scientists finds that overall, there were 137 cases of leukemia among the workers over the 20-year span of the study, and 16 percent of those cancers were attributable to the Chernobyl radiation exposure.The findings shed light on the thorny issue of estimating cancer risk from low doses of radiation.It is an issue of importance to miners, nuclear workers and anyone who is chronically exposed to low levels of radiation at work or patients who receive sizeable radiation doses when undergoing medical diagnostic tests.Source: ANI
Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum are slated to appear at a September “American Heritage Summit” in Washington, D.C., hosted by a right-wing Iowa pastor Cary Gordon of Cornerstone World Outreach.
Along with Gordon and the pair of likely presidential candidates, the guests include conservative pseudo-historian David Barton, Iowa-based talk show host Steve Deace and Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King.
Gordon became heavily involved in politics during the 2010 campaign to remove Iowa Supreme Court Justices who ruled in favor of marriage equality, and he endorsed Santorum's 2012 presidential campaign, helping the former Pennsylvania senator to win the Iowa caucuses.
At an anti-gay marriage rally in 2011, Gordon described marriage equality as a demonic attempt that would bring about America's destruction, warning that Iowans must “protect the virtue of true Americanism from our own mental barbarians who attack our minds with the God-hating secularism of Europe” or risk being “extinguished from the earth.”
Gordon even predicted that gay marriage would increase the murder rate: “The natural problem that causes is an overt immorality. The crime rates go up, people suffer, people are stealing and murdering and [doing] all the things morality tells you not to do.”
The pastor, insisting that it is a “glaringly obvious fact that being ‘gay' is a behavior, and has nothing to do with civil rights,” charged in a 2010 blog post that the same-sex marriage ruling put Iowa on the road to Nazism: “True pastors, in the fashion of Christ, will not and cannot bow before the arrogance of Caesar and Herod. We have learned from our past mistakes. We will not repeat the mistake made by Lutheran pastors when confronted with German fascism.”
“[T]o the intelligent religious man, homosexuality will always be un-natural for a myriad of obvious reasons one shouldn't have to explain,” Gordon wrote. “To the intelligent evolutionist, it will NEVER agree with the doctrine of ‘survival of the fittest.'”
Gordon's church also released a video asserting that same-sex marriage would legalize incest, pedophilia and bestiality.
For 53 years, Japan has enjoyed the luxury of high-speed Shinkansen trains. Now, the United States is still trying to catch up.
Texas Central, a private rail company, has a plan to implant the N700-I bullet train, based on the Shinkansen, between Houston and Dallas. The bullet train, which can zip across the state at about 205 mph, will potentially shave up to two hours off of driving time or nearly an hour off of air travel (including check-in, security and boarding).
If green-lit, the project will cost an estimated $12 billion, but will possibly reap $36 billion in "economic benefits" for the state within 25 years.
The money will come from investors, not government-sponsored subsidies or state taxes, which may allow Texas' bullet train dreams to come to fruition. In 2011, a proposal to build a high-speed rail in Florida was rejected by Gov. Rick Scott, who worried about a $3 billion price tag that could be billed to the state.
But even when plans are approved, the U.S. doesn't exactly have the best track record for actually building high-speed rail (or any rail, for that matter). California, for example, is still deliberating their project, which was initially approved in 2008. They already built their first 119 miles, but construction was about 50% over budget. Their 2016 business plan estimated the project would cost about $64 billion.

If Texas' bullet train does become a reality, previous experience tells us that it will be many years down the line. However, that doesn't mean we can't take pleasure in the thought of blasting through American heartlands at wild speeds.
A couple of days ago, Politico published a fascinating piece describing how factions associated with the current Ukrainian government apparently interfered in the U.S. election on behalf of Hillary Clinton. The findings seem pretty damning, and certainly warrant at least some conversation within the American media given the 24/7 obsession with Russia. Nevertheless, most of you have probably never heard of this saga, since when it comes to the corporate media news cycle, some election interference is more equal than others.
The article is lengthy, and can be confusing at times given all the moving parts, but I highly encourage you to read it. Ukrainian interference in the election can be traced to essentially two sources. First, there was the apparent collaboration between the Ukrainian embassy in Washington D.C. and a highly paid Ukrainian-American DNC consultant, Alexandra Chalupa. The second angle is far more disturbing, and involves the publicization of a so-called ledger demonstrating corruption between Paul Manafort and pro-Russian elements in Ukraine, by a parliamentarian named Serhiy Leshchenko. Bizarrely, the investigation was effectively dropped after Trump won the election, making you wonder if there was anything really there in the first place.
What follows are excerpts from the excellent piece, Ukrainian Efforts to Sabotage Trump Backfire:
Donald Trump wasn't the only presidential candidate whose campaign was boosted by officials of a former Soviet bloc country. Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found. A Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation. The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort's resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump's campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine's foe to the east, Russia. But they were far less concerted or centrally directed than Russia's alleged hacking and dissemination of Democratic emails. Politico's investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another's elections. The Ukrainian antipathy for Trump's team — and alignment with Clinton's — can be traced back to late 2013. That's when the country's president, Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort had been advising, abruptly backed out of a European Union pact linked to anti-corruption reforms. Instead, Yanukovych entered into a multibillion-dollar bailout agreement with Russia, sparking protests across Ukraine and prompting Yanukovych to flee the country to Russia under Putin's protection. In the ensuing crisis, Russian troops moved into the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and Manafort dropped off the radar. Manafort's work for Yanukovych caught the attention of a veteran Democratic operative named Alexandra Chalupa, who had worked in the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Clinton administration. Chalupa went on to work as a staffer, then as a consultant, for Democratic National Committee. The DNC paid her $412,000 from 2004 to June 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records, though she also was paid by other clients during that time, including Democratic campaigns and the DNC's arm for engaging expatriate Democrats around the world. She said she shared her concern with Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Valeriy Chaly, and one of his top aides, Oksana Shulyar, during a March 2016 meeting at the Ukrainian Embassy. According to someone briefed on the meeting, Chaly said that Manafort was very much on his radar, but that he wasn't particularly concerned about the operative's ties to Trump since he didn't believe Trump stood much of a chance of winning the GOP nomination, let alone the presidency. Chalupa said the embassy also worked directly with reporters researching Trump, Manafort and Russia to point them in the right directions. She added, though, “they were being very protective and not speaking to the press as much as they should have. I think they were being careful because their situation was that they had to be very, very careful because they could not pick sides. It's a political issue, and they didn't want to get involved politically because they couldn't.” Shulyar vehemently denied working with reporters or with Chalupa on anything related to Trump or Manafort, explaining “we were stormed by many reporters to comment on this subject, but our clear and adamant position was not to give any comment [and] not to interfere into the campaign affairs.” Shulyar said her work with Chalupa “didn't involve the campaign,” and she specifically stressed that “We have never worked to research and disseminate damaging information about Donald Trump and Paul Manafort.” But Andrii Telizhenko, who worked as a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy under Shulyar, said she instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia. “Oksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,” recalled Telizhenko, who is now a political consultant in Kiev. “They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa,” he said, adding “Oksana was keeping it all quiet,” but “the embassy worked very closely with” Chalupa. In fact, sources familiar with the effort say that Shulyar specifically called Telizhenko into a meeting with Chalupa to provide an update on an American media outlet's ongoing investigation into Manafort. Telizhenko recalled that Chalupa told him and Shulyar that, “If we can get enough information on Paul [Manafort] or Trump's involvement with Russia, she can get a hearing in Congress by September.”
Sure seems like pretty close coordination between a DNC consultant and the official embassy of Ukraine in the midst of a Presidential election.
Nevertheless, that's small potatoes compared to what happened within the Ukrainian parliament itself. As Politico notes:
While it's not uncommon for outside operatives to serve as intermediaries between governments and reporters, one of the more damaging Russia-related stories for the Trump campaign — and certainly for Manafort — can be traced more directly to the Ukrainian government. Documents released by an independent Ukrainian government agency — and publicized by a parliamentarian — appeared to show $12.7 million in cash payments that were earmarked for Manafort by the Russia-aligned party of the deposed former president, Yanukovych. The New York Times, in the August story revealing the ledgers' existence, reported that the payments earmarked for Manafort were “a focus” of an investigation by Ukrainian anti-corruption officials, while CNN reported days later that the FBI was pursuing an overlapping inquiry. Clinton's campaign seized on the story to advance Democrats' argument that Trump's campaign was closely linked to Russia. The ledger represented “more troubling connections between Donald Trump's team and pro-Kremlin elements in Ukraine,” Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, said in a statement. He demanded that Trump “disclose campaign chair Paul Manafort's and all other campaign employees' and advisers' ties to Russian or pro-Kremlin entities, including whether any of Trump's employees or advisers are currently representing and or being paid by them.” A former Ukrainian investigative journalist and current parliamentarian named Serhiy Leshchenko, who was elected in 2014 as part of Poroshenko's party, held a news conference to highlight the ledgers, and to urge Ukrainian and American law enforcement to aggressively investigate Manafort. “I believe and understand the basis of these payments are totally against the law — we have the proof from these books,” Leshchenko said during the news conference, which attracted international media coverage. “If Mr. Manafort denies any allegations, I think he has to be interrogated into this case and prove his position that he was not involved in any misconduct on the territory of Ukraine,” Leshchenko added.
These are some really serious allegations, which makes his current behavior, which I'll highlight later, that much more concerning.
Manafort denied receiving any off-books cash from Yanukovych's Party of Regions, and said that he had never been contacted about the ledger by Ukrainian or American investigators, later telling POLITICO “I was just caught in the crossfire.” The scrutiny around the ledgers — combined with that from other stories about his Ukraine work — proved too much, and he stepped down from the Trump campaign less than a week after the Times story. At the time, Leshchenko suggested that his motivation was partly to undermine Trump. “For me, it was important to show not only the corruption aspect, but that he is [a] pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world,” Leshchenko told the Financial Times about two weeks after his news conference. The newspaper noted that Trump's candidacy had spurred “Kiev's wider political leadership to do something they would never have attempted before: intervene, however indirectly, in a U.S. election,” and the story quoted Leshchenko asserting that the majority of Ukraine's politicians are “on Hillary Clinton's side.”
Well, well, well…but there's more.
An operative who has worked extensively in Ukraine, including as an adviser to Poroshenko, said it was highly unlikely that either Leshchenko or the anti-corruption bureau would have pushed the issue without at least tacit approval from Poroshenko or his closest allies. “It was something that Poroshenko was probably aware of and could have stopped if he wanted to,” said the operative. And, almost immediately after Trump's stunning victory over Clinton, questions began mounting about the investigations into the ledgers — and the ledgers themselves. An official with the anti-corruption bureau told a Ukrainian newspaper, “Mr. Manafort does not have a role in this case.” And, while the anti-corruption bureau told Politico late last month that a “general investigation [is] still ongoing” of the ledger, it said Manafort is not a target of the investigation. “As he is not the Ukrainian citizen, [the anti-corruption bureau] by the law couldn't investigate him personally,” the bureau said in a statement.
Note that the only thing that changed is Trump won the election, which apparently caused the Ukrainian government to backtrack on the entire thing after its sabotage failed to deliver the desire outcome.
Some Poroshenko critics have gone further, suggesting that the bureau is backing away from investigating because the ledgers might have been doctored or even forged. And in an interview this week, Manafort, who re-emerged as an informal advisor to Trump after Election Day, suggested that the ledgers were inauthentic and called their publication “a politically motivated false attack on me. My role as a paid consultant was public. There was nothing off the books, but the way that this was presented tried to make it look shady.”
As shameless as all of this is, it doesn't end there.
Poroshenko's allies are scrambling to figure out how to build a relationship with Trump, who is known for harboring and prosecuting grudges for years. A delegation of Ukrainian parliamentarians allied with Poroshenko last month traveled to Washington partly to try to make inroads with the Trump transition team, but they were unable to secure a meeting, according to a Washington foreign policy operative familiar with the trip. And operatives in Washington and Kiev say that after the election, Poroshenko met in Kiev with top executives from the Washington lobbying firm BGR — including Ed Rogers and Lester Munson — about how to navigate the Trump regime. Weeks later, BGR reported to the Department of Justice that the government of Ukraine would pay the firm $50,000 a month to “provide strategic public relations and government affairs counsel,” including “outreach to U.S. government officials, non-government organizations, members of the media and other individuals.”
The fact that foreign influence is purchased like this is simply disgusting, but I digress.
In fact, I've saved the best for last…
The Poroshenko regime's standing with Trump is considered so dire that the president's allies after the election actually reached out to make amends with — and even seek assistance from — Manafort, according to two operatives familiar with Ukraine's efforts to make inroads with Trump.
After essentially claiming that Manafort was a hired gun for Putin to intervene in the internal affairs of Ukraine, the government is now reaching out to him? You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to see something's not adding up here. Was the entire investigation a fraud to help Hillary Clinton win the election? If so, isn't that election interference?
Nevertheless, I somehow I doubt we'll see America's three stooges, Graham, Rubio and McCain make a big stink over this one.

Judging by the records being set on Wall Street and steady reports by corporations of high profits and hoarded cash, you'd think the economy was doing well. Yet a new poll reports that six of every 10 American workers fear getting fired or laid off, the highest measured level of job anxiety since the 1970s.
Welcome to the new America.
The poll, by The Washington Post and the University of Virginia's Miller Center, casts into sharp relief the everyday anxieties of the working poor, and argues that the sense of unease has become something of a permanent condition among people struggling to make ends meet. From the Post:
Job insecurities have always been higher among low-income Americans, but they typically rose and fell across all levels of the income ladder. Today, workers at the bottom have drifted away, occupying their own island of in­security. Fifty-four percent of workers making $35,000 or less now worry “a lot” about losing their jobs, compared with 37 percent of ­lower-income workers in 1992 and an identical number in 1975, according to surveys by Time magazine, CNN and Yankelovich, a market research firm. Intense worry is far lower, 29 percent, among workers with incomes between $35,000 and $75,000, and it drops to 17 percent among those with incomes above that level. Lower-paid workers also worry far more about making ends meet. Fully 85 percent of them fear that their families' income will not be enough to meet expenses, up 25 points from a 1971 survey asking an identical question. Thirty-two percent say they worry all the time about meeting expenses, a number that has almost tripled since the 1970s.
The mood even transcends our fractious politics. The Post reports that “once you control for economic and demographic factors, there is no partisan divide. There's no racial divide, either, and no gender gap. It also doesn't matter where you live.”
The Post framed the poll story around the daily life of John Stewart, 55, who makes $5.25 an hour plus occasional tips wheeling elderly passengers through a Philadelphia-area airport. Stewart has worked low-wage jobs since the 1970s, when the economy was strong and diverse enough to offer a place for a worker with a high school education and few skills. “In the years back then,'' Stewart told the Post, “if you left a job, you were able to find another job, within the next day or the same week.”
Not any more. In 2010 Stewart lost a job at a New Jersey Wal-Mart — tardiness was the issue, he told the Post, due to relying on public transportation — and moved to Philadelphia to start over. It took him five months to find the airport job, and that was through a friend from church.
Ironically, although the poll found those at the bottom of the wage ladder have the highest levels of uncertainty, they also have the highest levels of belief that they will some day find better-paying jobs — even as they acknowledge they lack the means to obtain the kinds of skills that would help them do that.
Several economists say there's a simple explanation for that gap: Poorer people can't spare the time or money to go to school. Stewart, for example, would love to ditch his airport job to work as a hospital aide, hopefully for higher pay and at least some health benefits. (His job now offers none.) He'd need to take classes to earn a certification to qualify for that work. He has no idea how he'd swing that, financially. But he has hope that he will — and that, too, is typical of low-earning, anxious workers today. Nearly six in 10 of those workers think it's likely they'll find a new job that pays better in the next five years, compared with fewer than four in 10 middle- and upper-income workers. Almost half expect a significant raise at their current job in the next half-decade, again outpacing the optimism of those who currently take home more.
That seems, though, to just reflect the relative space down the economic ladder, and above, as well as the gap between hope and reality. It also brings to mind that old Doors song, “Well, I've been down so Goddamn long/That it looks like up to me.”

Detective David E. Abbott Jr. of the Manassas City Police Department. He committed suicide as police were attempting to arrest him on child molestation charges last year, and was the lead detective in a teen “sexting” case in 2014. (Manassas City Police Department)
The investigation of a “sexting” case involving a Prince William County teenager, and the desire by prosecutors and police to repeatedly obtain photos of his genitalia, sparked a national uproar in the summer of 2014. Authorities backed down from their second search warrant for explicit photos, and the teen was placed on probation. The case took a further turn last December when the detective, David E. Abbott Jr., was accused of molesting two young boys and killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his Gainesville townhouse.
But the case isn't over. The teenager, Trey Sims, 19, filed a federal civil rights suit Wednesday against both Abbott's estate and Claiborne Richardson II, the assistant Prince William commonwealth's attorney who police said directed Abbott to obtain a search warrant for photographs of Sims' genitalia, for comparison with video sent to Sims' then-15-year-old girlfriend. In June 2014, Abbott did get a search warrant and photograph Sims with a cell phone, which attorney Victor M. Glasberg alleged was manufacturing child pornography. When Abbott and Richardson obtained a second search warrant, for photos of Sims erect, reports in The Washington Post “prompted a firestorm of public protest,” Glasberg wrote, causing Richardson and Abbott to withdraw the warrant.
Richardson did not return messages seeking comment Wednesday. Though Abbott's estate is named as a defendant, Glasberg said that if liability insurance held by the Manassas City police did not cover the former detective's actions, he would not pursue assets held by his heirs.
The suit was filed in federal district court in Alexandria and assigned to U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton. It states that the incident began when Sims' girlfriend sent nude photos of herself to him by cell phone, which the girl's mother identified at Sims' trial in 2014. Sims responded with “an explicit video of himself via his cell phone,” Glasberg wrote, though Abbott testified that the sender's face was not visible. The girl's mother reported the video to the Manassas City police. Sims was then charged with manufacturing and distributing child pornography, but the girl was not. Glasberg said Richardson and Abbott only charged Sims because he is male, a violation of his equal protection rights.
[In ‘sexting' case, Manassas City police want to photograph teen in sexually explict manner, lawyers say]
Beginning in January 2014, Sims was placed on home confinement, could not use a cell phone and could only leave home to go to school, Osbourn High in Manassas. When his trial arrived in June 2014, Richardson had to dismiss the charge because he could not prove Sims' age, his lawyer, Jessica Harbeson Foster, said. Leaving the courtroom, “Abbott told Trey, menacingly,” Glasberg wrote, “words to the effect, ‘This isn't over' and ‘I will be back.'”

Richardson then directed Abbott to obtain a detention order for the 17-year-old, and he was arrested and taken to juvenile jail. That day, Abbott obtained a search warrant and at the juvenile detention center ordered Sims to pull down his pants, or Abbott would force him to do so, the suit alleges. Abbott then took photos of Sims' unerect penis with a cell phone, forced Sims “to touch and position his penis for the pictures,” Glasberg wrote, “to be photographed as though masturbating, thereby creating child pornography.”
Prince William police would later allege that Abbott, an unmarried youth hockey coach who lived with his mother, had been conducting inappropriate relationships with some of his teen players. Glasberg cited the warrants police obtained for two counts of indecent liberties by a custodian and two counts of use of a communication device to solicit a sexual offense, and said that Abbott was “simply gratifying his own perverse pleasures” by photographing Sims. He said Sims was embarrassed and humiliated by the encounter.
Sims was released from juvenile detention but was again placed on home confinement and curfew. Then, later in June 2014, Abbott told Foster that he would need photos of Sims' erect penis to compare to the video sent to the girl. “Det. Abbott advised [Foster],” Glasberg wrote, “that Trey could either accomplish an erection himself or Manassas police personnel would take him to a hospital to give him an erection-producing injection,” a threat which was “gratuitous, malicious, wanton and willful.”
Abbott did obtain a second search warrant, but after it became public, did not serve it. Sims went to trial on Aug. 1, 2014, after Richardson amended the charge from manufacturing child pornography to possession. Prince William Juvenile Court Judge George M. DePolo ruled, “The court finds facts sufficient on both counts” to convict the teen, “but the court is not going to make a finding at this time.” He deferred a finding pending a year of probation for Sims, who was ordered to do 100 hours of community service, could not leave the county without permission, was on curfew and could not use social media or texting, except to his guardian or school.
[Manassas City teen placed on probation in sexting case where police sought photos]
Sims completed his probation and the charges were dismissed last August. But Glasberg said the episode “derailed his college plans,” and he is now working after graduating from high school. The suit notes that Sims moved to Manassas City to escape drug-abusing parents, and had been a good student and football and basketball player at Osbourn High.
Meanwhile, Abbott filed a libel suit against Sims' criminal attorney, Foster, for comments made in The Post, but dropped it last year, not long after Glasberg had issued notice to the police and prosecutors that he was preparing a civil suit.
Glasberg said Sims did not want to let the case die. “There are some things,” Glasberg said, “that are so outrageously inappropriate that somebody's got to blow the whistle and say, ‘You can't do this.'”
Government officials may not claim sovereign immunity from constitutional claims, for actions taken in the course of their job, Glasberg said. But they may claim qualified immunity, for actions they did not know would lead to constitutional violations. Sims is alleging that his Fourth Amendment right not to be unreasonably searched was violated by both his arrest and the photography of his genitalia, and that Richardson and Abbott conspired to violate Sims' civil rights after Sims declined a plea offer from Richardson. Glasberg is seeking both actual and punitive damages.
HOUSTON, TX. - If you've been to any of the National Rifle Association's annual meetings, you'll understand what I mean when I say the gathering is a true representation of what makes America exceptional.
This year, the NRA held its annual meetings and convention in Houston and was attended by more than 85,000 people. Last year it was held in St. Louis and the year before in Pittsburgh. Over the past few months, the NRA has seen their membership balloon and just last Friday, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre announced the organization has reached 5 million members.
The common thing that brings all of these people together is obviously a celebration of the Second Amendment and the guaranteed right embedded in our Constitution for the people to keep and bear arms without infringement, but there are many other common American values and themes found at the convention that are often overlooked.
Capitalism:
Each year no matter the venue, the NRA convention center floor is an amazing example of capitalism as hundreds of companies show and sell thousands of different products. Major companies from Midway USA to Remington to Ruger are there in addition to smaller start ups who have been able to find a comfortable home in the firearms industry. The NRA advertises the convention as “acres and acres of gear,” something that isn't possible without embracing the ideas of competition, the free market, choice and entrepreneurship.
Free Speech:
The NRA annual meetings aren't just about looking at all the new gear available on the convention floor. There are many seminars and speeches where people with both big and small voices can be heard. Only in America can you have speakers standing in front of a crowd of thousands to directly call out the President of the United States by name without persecution or punishment. Only in America do you see thousands of people peacefully standing up and saying ‘no' to an infringement on their rights.
Equality:
The National Rifle Association is the oldest civil rights organization in the United States and serves as one of the most important in the world. After all, without the Second Amendment, there is no First. Founded in 1871, the NRA has always promoted equality of rights for everyone.
As a reminder:
Following the firebombing of his house in 1956, Dr. Martin Luther King, who was, among other things, a Christian minister, applied for a gun permit, but the Alabama authorities found him unsuitable. A decade later, he won a Nobel Peace Prize.
How's that "may issue" gun permit policy working for you?
The NRA opposed these discretionary gun permit laws and proceeded to grant NRA charters to blacks who sought to defend themselves from Klan violence -- including the great civil rights hero Robert F. Williams.
A World War II Marine veteran, Williams returned home to Monroe, N.C., to find the Klan riding high -- beating, lynching and murdering blacks at will. No one would join the NAACP for fear of Klan reprisals. Williams became president of the local chapter and increased membership from six to more than 200.
But it was not until he got a charter from the NRA in 1957 and founded the Black Armed Guard that the Klan got their comeuppance in Monroe.
Williams' repeated thwarting of violent Klan attacks is described in his stirring book, "Negroes With Guns." In one crucial battle, the Klan sieged the home of a black physician and his wife, but Williams and his Black Armed Guard stood sentry and repelled the larger, cowardly force. And that was the end of it.
As the Klan found out, it's not so much fun when the rabbit's got the gun.
The NRA's proud history of fighting the Klan has been airbrushed out of the record by those who were complicit with the KKK, Jim Crow and racial terror, to wit: the Democrats.
Women are the fastest growing demographic in the country and this fact was clearly embraced at this year's convention. The NRA has launched an entire media organization dedicated to women with role models like Second Amendment advocate Natalie Foster and shooting champion Julie Golob leading the way. There is nothing more empowering as a woman than to be able to understand how to protect yourself.
As the old saying goes, “God made man and God made woman. Sam Colt made them equal.”
Individual Responsibility:
There were thousands of guns at the NRA annual meetings and not one jumped up and killed someone, imagine that. Each and every person who is a member of the NRA and attends the annual meeting understands the important and basic fundamental principle of individual responsibility, especially when it comes to owning a firearm. The NRA understands and promotes this idea through education, Refuse to Be a Victim courses, legal self-defense courses and more.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A Kansas City woman was charged Saturday with abusing her 10-year-old daughter who weighed just 32 pounds when she was found locked in a closet that reeked of urine.
The 29-year-old woman faces charges of assault and child abuse and endangerment in Jackson County Circuit Court. The Associated Press is not naming the mother to protect the child's identity. Prosecutors are requesting that bond be set at $200,000.
Officers freed the girl after responding Friday morning to a call to a child abuse hotline. Neighbors told police that they didn't know the malnourished child taken from the public housing complex even lived there.
When officers first arrived, two women told the officers that the mother had left about 20 minutes earlier with two girls, whom they described as "clean and well fed," a Kansas City officer said in the probable cause statement.
A social services worker said there should be three children at the home. But the women insisted, "No, we have lived here for several years, and she only has two daughters that stay here, and we have never seen the other girl, but we heard she stays with the father or an aunt," the probable because statement said.
Officers ultimately made their way into the apartment, where they found a portable crib pushed up against a bedroom closet, which was tied closed. The officers asked if anyone was inside, and a child's voice answered "yes," the probable because statement said.
The girl told officers that her mother took her sisters out to breakfast, but she didn't go because "she messes herself."
The girl was transported to a Children's Mercy Hospital, where she was diagnosed with multiple skin injuries. Hospital staff said she had gained just 6 pounds since she last was at the hospital six years earlier.
The girl told detectives who interviewed her at the hospital that her mother puts her in the closet "a lot," that she doesn't get to eat every day and that she "does not want to go back home anymore." The girl also said she gets in trouble "because she keeps peeing on herself" and her mother will "punch her on her back real hard," according to the probable cause statement.
The mother was arrested later Friday and the two younger children were placed in protective custody. The mother told police she doesn't let the 10-year-old leave the house because she knows the girl is malnourished and would "get in trouble if someone saw her."
The mother's boyfriend, who is not the girl's father and hasn't been charged, said he hadn't seen the girl in about a year. He said that when he asked about her, the mother told him she was with her aunt or in her room because she was in trouble. He said he never knew the mother put the girl in the closet or "he would have done something about it," the probable because statement said.
Mike Mansur, a spokesman for the Jackson County prosecutor's office, said the mother hasn't said why she singled the girl out.
The pony, named "Fat Boy", escaped from its stable, broke into a nearby garden with another pony, and began munching the fallen apples.
It is thought that the rotten fruit had begun to ferment, causing the animal to become 'drunk'.
Twelve-year-old Fat Boy stumbled across the garden, and fell into the outdoor swimming pool which was covered by tarpaulin.
Sarah Penhaligon, 28, owner of the bungalow in Newquay, Cornwall, was woken at night by a "huge" splash and found the Moorland Pony in the shallow end.
She said: "I looked outside, saw this massive animal in the dark, and thought the Beast of Bodmin was in the pool. I was terrified, but when I took a closer look I realised it was a horse.
"I didn't have a clue what to do next - who do you call when there's a horse stuck in your swimming pool?
"I dialled 999 and they asked which service I wanted and I said I didn't know, I just had a horse in my pool and needed help."
Fire crews spent two hours building a set of hay steps in the pool, and hoisted the animal out of the water at 5am with the help of several harnesses.
The pony had escaped from the nearby Trenance riding stables. A spokesman said horses were known to get 'punch drunk' from eating too many apples.
She said: "It looks like he was scrounging for apples in the garden and fell in when he trod on the tarpaulin over the pool.
"It's a good job he's got a lot of bulk, as it kept him warm while he was stuck in the water.
"After he got out he was taken back and checked over by a vet, but luckily he's fine."

Button, button, who's got the button is a game of ingenuity where players form a circle with their hands out, palms together. One child, called the leader or 'it', takes an object such as a button and goes around the circle, putting their hands in everybody else's hands one by one. In one person's hands they drop the button, though they continue to put their hands in the others' so that no one knows where the button is except for the giver and receiver.
The leader, or all the children in the circle, says "Button, button, who's got the button?" and then each child in the circle guesses. The child guessing replies with their choice, e.g. "Billy has the button!"
Once the child with the button is finally guessed, that child is the one to distribute the button and start a new round.
Alternate versions [ edit ]
Version 2 [ edit ]
A second similar version has the child who is "it" stand in the center of the circle. The button is then passed behind the backs of the children in the circle, stopping at random. "It" tries to guess where the button is and once the button is found takes his or her place in the circle. Whoever had the button then becomes the new "it" and play begins again.
Version 3 [ edit ]
A slight variation on the first two versions has "it" ask questions (like in the game Twenty Questions) to determine who has the button.
Version 4 [ edit ]
Another version is usually played by several children with one adult. The game's origin is unknown, but it existed before 1900. The children start by sitting on the bottom stair of a staircase. The adult holds out both fists, one holding a button. The adult asks, "Button, button, who's got the button?" Whoever guesses correctly advances one step. The first one to reach the top step wins the game. If the staircase is not wide enough, the children can be divided up into teams.
Version 5 [ edit ]
Buttony - a Murray Family Tradition, North East England, since the 1800s [ edit ]
Two teams sit either side of a long table, with a "Team Captain" in the centre of each side. The button starts with the team captain of the active team, and the whole of the active team puts their hands under the table, towards the team captain. The team captain then puts the button into someone else's hand (or alternatively may choose to keep it). The button can exchange hands a couple of times, or may stay with the person the team captain chose. In the meantime, the other team chant "Button, Button, who's got the Button, 1, 2, 3". As the number 3 is counted, the active team put their hands onto the table in front of them, with their hands apart, and fists clenched (with the backs of their hands facing upwards). The opposing team then get one guess each to try guess who has the button, and in which hand (in theory a 50% chance). If they find the button, they get one point, and they become the active team. If they don't find the button, the person who has the button is revealed, the active team gets a point, and they stay the active team for another round. The team with the most points at the end of the game (either a set number of rounds, or when everyone agrees to finish), wins. Often there was a prize of an apple each, or a piece of chocolate each for the winners (which was often shared with the other team anyway).
The government promotes recovery by keeping out of the way.
The Obama Boom is finally here. Gross domestic product grew by a healthy 5 percent in the third quarter, the strongest growth we've seen since 2003. Consumer spending looks as if it's going to be strong in 2015. Unemployment numbers have looked good. Buying power is up. And the Dow Jones Industrials closed at 18,000 for the first time ever. All good things. So what happened?

Here's David Axelrod on Twitter: “Note: The quarter before Obama took office, the U.S. economy SHRUNK by 8.9 percent, worst since 1930. Last quarter it GREW by 5 percent, best since 2003.”
Note: Contrasting the most severe quarter of your predecessor's presidency with the best one in your six-year presidency — one filled with extravagant and unmet economic promises — may strike your readers as a bit hackish. But let's go with it.
Axelrod isn't alone is claiming political credit for economic success, and the Obama administration certainly isn't the first to try to take the glory. But if activist policies really have as big an impact on our economic fortunes as Washington operatives claim, I only have one question: What policy did Barack Obama enact to initiate this astonishing turnaround? We should definitely replicate it.
Because those who've been paying attention these past few years may have noticed that the predominant agenda of Washington has been to do nothing. It was only when the tinkering and superfluous stimulus spending wound down that fortunes began to turn around. So it's perplexing how the same pundits who cautioned us about gridlock's traumatizing effects now ignore its existence.

For instance, Paul Krugman wrote a column titled “The Obama Recovery.” The problem is that the author failed to justify his headline. It begins like this:
Suppose that for some reason you decided to start hitting yourself in the head, repeatedly, with a baseball bat. You'd feel pretty bad. Correspondingly, you'd probably feel a lot better if and when you finally stopped. What would that improvement in your condition tell you?
Advertisement
Suppose you tell us what the bat represents, because spending in current dollars has remained steady since 2010, and spending as a percentage of GDP has gone down. In 2009, 125 bills were enacted into law. In 2010, 258. After that, Congress, year by year, became one of the least productive in history. And the more unproductive Washington became, the more the economy began to improve.
Krugman argues that the recession lingered because the government hadn't hired enough people to do taxpayer-funded busywork. The baseball bats. But then he undercuts this notion by pointing out that there was an explosion of public-sector hiring under George W. Bush — the man he claims caused the entire mess in the first place. Krugman also ignores the stimulus, because it screws up his imaginary “austerity” timeline. He then spends most of the column debunking austerity's success in Britain.

He does this because, in theory, left-wing economic policies can never lose. For years, the administration rationalized the crippling unemployment we experienced by spinning a comforting counter-history: Things would have been a lot worse. But didn't the stimulus fail even if we judged it on its own promises? Well, it should have been bigger. Wasn't this the slowest recovery in history? Well, this was the worst situation since the Great Depression.
The Boston Globe, in an editorial reflecting much of the evidence-free praise the president has gotten, spins another myth. It points to policies passed in 2010 as the reason for growth today. But it's just as easy — and more plausible, when we consider the history of our strong emergence from severe recessions — to suggest that the economy could have been a lot better had the administration alleviated many of its early regulatory and tax burdens. Or done nothing. Certainly, a person could just as effortlessly argue that shoehorning huge agenda items under the guise of spurring growth was more harmful than helpful.

“People often don't realize that a political system is sometimes effective when it does not do certain things,” Pietro Nivola, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, argued in 2012. “You can't just measure the things it does, the actions it takes; you also have to measure the actions it does not take.” Nivola was impressed by how gridlock has the ability to stop the Republican House from cutting spending too abruptly for the economy.
And perhaps he's right. Gridlock has caused an odd but pervasive stability in Washington. Spending has been static. No jarring reforms have passed — no cap-and-trade, which would have artificially spiked energy prices and undercut the growth we're now experiencing. The inadvertent but reigning policy over the past four years has been “do no harm.”

On the strength of good economic news, Politico reports, Obama will use his State of the Union address to roll out an agenda aimed at the stagnating wages and those Americans left behind to build on the growth. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that it's going to incorporate a lot of happy talk about “infrastructure” and a fairer reallocation of wealth. We need to grow from the middle out, if you will. No doubt, politically speaking, Democrats' fortunes are bound to improve somewhat as economic anxieties ebb. The president will surely see better approval numbers.
But let's hear specifics. As I remember it, the administration hasn't done anything in a long time. I know this because an incalculable number of op-eds have informed me that the president has had to contend with militant ideologues and has been unable to implement his agenda. I know this because I've had to listen to years of hand-wringing about politicians' inaction. You can't have it both ways.

The sight of sheep grazing on the south lawn of the White House may seem unusual, but during World War I, it was a highly visible symbol of home front support of the troops overseas. The flock, which numbered 48 at its peak, saved manpower by cutting the grass and earned $52,823 for the Red Cross through an auction of their wool. The Wilsons wanted to be a model American family helping the war effort, so they suspended entertaining at the White House and actively participated in public programs. Margaret Wilson sang to raise money for the troops. Mrs. Wilson organized war bond rallies, which were held on the steps of the Treasury Building with appearances by such Hollywood stars as Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Marie Dressler, and Douglas Fairbanks. She also demonstrated her support by publicizing White House compliance to food and fuel conservation programs spearheaded by Herbert Hoover, one of Wilson's dollar-a-year-men and head of the Food Administration.

The die-hard fans, who spent the better part of the last four months pulling their hair out over a club that seemed destined to waste a league-best offence thanks to bad luck, a bad bullpen, and inconsistent starting pitching, have been truly gobsmacked by their team's rapid transformation, thanks to a frenzy of activity at the trade deadline, into the most dangerous team in the sport. And now they're being joined—be it down at a packed Rogers Centre, or among those powering the club's skyrocketing TV ratings—by a different, more casual kind of fan.
The Toronto Blue Jays are suddenly the hottest ticket and the biggest party in Toronto—maybe in all of Canada, and maybe all baseball, too. And that's great! The more the merrier, and the more revenue the club can generate, the better its chances are of keeping payroll high and this whole thing going into next year and beyond.

So climb aboard the bandwagon, new friends! Here's what you need to know to get up to speed on what's been happening at the Rogers Centre while you were out enjoying your summer.
A Slogan That Fits
The Jays' marketing slogan this season was "Come Together," which has generally been derided and scoffed at for being too vague, or too easily joked about as sexual innuendo. But it has actually turned out to be rather prescient. The team was a mess all season. Until the week of the trade deadline, this was a good club with a mediocre record, inconsistent starting pitching, and a bullpen that was one part unlucky, two parts kinda terrible. Everything that had been good about the club came entirely by way of its league-best offence. Since then? Everything has come together just about as perfectly as it could have been imagined. Perhaps you've noticed.
A Surprising Addition
It was clear by late July (if not much earlier) that the Jays needed help preventing runs from scoring, and while most expected that to come in the form of pitching, their first big move was the surprise addition of shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. Tulo has always had trouble staying on the field (he missed much of last season with hip surgery, for example) but when he's healthy he's the best all-around shortstop in the game—very good with the glove and a monster with the bat. In early 2014 it was often discussed whether he or Mike Trout was the best player in baseball. Some now are having that same conversation about Trout and Tulowitzki's new teammate, third baseman Josh Donaldson. And while the answer in both instances is Trout, the Blue Jays suddenly have themselves a ridiculous left side of the infield.
The Ace
The Jays weren't finished trying to keep other teams off the board, though. The day before the deadline they added a former Cy Young winner and legitimate ace, David Price, in a stunning deal with the Detroit Tigers. Price is one of the best pitchers in baseball—his bona fides don't really need to be dissected—but he's also a presence. He brings star power, a great sense of humour that he displays frequently on Twitter, an obvious willingness to quickly fit in with teammates, as well as dread from the opponents who have to face him. He's only a rental, though—he's a free agent after this season, and it's highly unlikely the Jays can keep him, even though he seems to have immediately fallen in love with the city, and vice versa—and he cost the club five years of a very good prospect in walking-human-interest-story Daniel Norris (did you know he lives in a van???), and more. Looks like a great decision by the club so far, though.

What A Relief
Aaron Sanchez, who began the year as a starting pitcher, returned from injury as a reliever—a role he had tremendous success in last season—which helped to settle the bullpen, as he and rookie Roberto Osuna now give the Jays a late-inning combination of power-armed youngsters with terrific stuff. Mix in the trade deadline additions of Mark Lowe (an out-of-nowhere strikeout machine who began the year in Seattle) and the ageless LaTroy Hawkins (who, amazingly, was drafted in the same year as former Blue Jays star Shawn Green, who retired after 2007) and a bullpen that was once a weakness is now a strength. Aaron Loup has barely been seen since the moves were made, and anyone who has been following all year will tell you what a relief that is.
Out With The Old
Perhaps the most amazing thing in all this is that the previous core of the team is still here, save for the one player it seemed likely the Jays were going to be stuck with: Jose Reyes. It's not that Reyes was a bad player for the Jays, necessarily—though some will tell you otherwise—it's that his skills were eroding. The once-dynamic shortstop, who was a base-stealing, triple-hitting machine with a enough speed and arm to be a plus on defence, had simply lost a step—with his legs, with his bat, and with his glove. Some of the misplays he made this season were downright ugly, and it didn't exactly feel like better times were on the horizon. It cost some outstanding prospects to move him—in particular, last year's top draft pick, right-handed pitcher Jeff Hoffman—and the Jays ended up taking on more salary over the long term, too, but they got Tulo out of it. Nobody should ever complain about this deal.

The Forgotten Star
Jose Bautista, amazingly, given that he's been the face of the Blue Jays' franchise for so long, has lately been a little overlooked thanks to the influx of shiny new stars in the Jays' universe. Bautista isn't having his best year, but he's also suffered through a shoulder problem, exacerbated by a lapse in judgment in a heated April game against the Orioles, when he tried in anger to throw Delmon Young out at first base from right field after the Orioles had been throwing at him all series. (The Orioles and Royals are the teams we hate the most this year, FYI). Bautista's defence, and therefore his standing among the league leaders in Wins Above Replacement, has suffered as a result, but he's still one of the top 20 hitters in the game, despite the pain he's playing through. Show him the love he deserves.
The Secret Weapon
It was announced last week that Marcus Stroman is tentatively scheduled to pitch in a rehab game August 21st, and this week came word that the club aims to stretch him out to be a starter, provided he is healthy enough to return in September. All of this has made Jays fans absolutely giddy, as it was expected coming into the season that the second-year starter would blossom into the club's ace. And it wasn't just fans who were excited—the industry was, too, whipping fans into a frenzy over Stroman, his ridiculous arsenal of pitches, and the improvements he continued to make on the mound during his rookie season. The Jays saw it, too, and by some reports Stroman was slated to be the club's Opening Day starter. That is, before he blew out his knee and it was announced that he would miss the entire season. The blow was made less devastating, however, by Stroman's enthusiasm and determination to get back on the field, and now, amazingly, he's followed through. He's pitching this year.

Odds And Ends
GENEVA — North Korea's latest test of an atomic weapon leaves the United States with an uncomfortable choice: Stick with a policy of incremental sanctions that has clearly failed to stop the country's nuclear advances, or pick among alternatives that range from the highly risky to the repugnant.
A hard embargo, in which Washington and its allies block all shipping into and out of North Korea and seek to paralyze its finances, risks confrontations that allies in Asia fear could quickly escalate into war. But restarting talks on the North's terms would reward the defiance of its young leader, Kim Jong-un, with no guarantee that he will dismantle the nuclear program irrevocably.
Speaking in Geneva early Saturday morning after announcing a deal with Russia over the Syrian conflict, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States was willing to negotiate with North Korea, but only if it agreed that the goal of those talks was for it to give up its weapons. “We have made overture after overture to the dictator of North Korea,” he said, including on normalizing the country's relationship with the West and a formal peace agreement to replace the 1953 armistice that halted the Korean War but not the state of hostilities.
“All Kim Jong-un needs to do is say, ‘I'm prepared to talk about denuclearization,'” Mr. Kerry said.

Judge Says NSA Bulk Metadata Collection Likely Unconstitutional, Issues Injunction
from the stayed-for-appeal dept
The Court finds that it does... have the authority to evaluate plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the NSA's conduct, notwithstanding the fact that it was done pursuant to orders issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ("FISC"). And after careful consideration of the parties' pleadings and supplemental pleadings, the representations made on the record at the November 18, 2013 hearings regarding these motions, and the applicable law, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Government's bulk collection and querying of phone record metadata, that they have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim, and that they will suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary injunctive relief.
After stating that fewer than 300 unique identifiers met the RAS standard and were used as "seeds" to query the metadata in 2012, Ms. Shea notes that "[b]ecause the same seed identifier can be queried more than once over time, can generate multiple responsive records, and can be used to obtain contact numbers up to three 'hops' from the seed identifier, the number of metadata records responsive to such queries is substantially larger than 300, but is still a very small percentage of the total volume of metadata records. " (emphasis added). The first part of this assertion is a glaring understatement, while the second is virtually meaningless when placed in context. First, as the sample numbers I have used in the text above demonstrate, it is possible to arrive at a query result in the millions within three hops while using even conservative numbers--needless to say, this is "substantially larger than 300." After all, even if the average person in the United States does not call or receive calls from 100 unique phone numbers in one year, what about over a five-year period? And second, it belabors the obvious to note that even a few million phone numbers is "a very small percentage of the total volume of metadata records" if the Government has collected metadata records on hundreds of millions of phone numbers.
But it's also easy to imagine the spiderweb-like reach of the three-hop search growing exponentially and capturing even higher numbers of phone numbers. Suppose, for instance, that there is a person living in New York City who has a phone number that meets the RAS standard and is approved as a "seed." And suppose this person, who may or may not actually be associated with any terrorist organization, calls or receives calls from 100 unique numbers, as in my example. But now suppose that one of the numbers he calls is his neighborhood Domino's Pizza shop. The Court won't hazard a guess as to how many different phone numbers might dial a given Domino's Pizza outlet in New York City in a five-year period, but to take a page from the Government's book of understatement, it's "substantially larger" than the 100 in the second hop of my example, and would therefore most likely result in exponential growth in the scope of the query and lead to millions of records being captured by the third hop.
First, as to the collection, the Supreme Court decided Clapper just months before the June 2013 news reports revealed the existence and scope of certain NSA surveillance activities. Thus, whereas the plaintiffs in Clapper could only speculate as to whether they would be surveilled at all, plaintiffs in this case can point to strong evidence that, as Verizon customers, their telephony metadata has been collected for the last seven years (and stored for the last five) and will continue to be collected barring judicial or legislative intervention.... In addition, the Government has declassified and authenticated an April 25, 2013 FISC Order signed by Judge Vinson, which confirms that the NSA has indeed collected metadata from Verizon.
Straining mightily to find a reason that plaintiffs nonetheless lack standing to challenge the metadata collection, the Government argues that Judge Vinson's order names only Verizon Business Network Services ("VBNS") as the recipient of the order, whereas plaintiffs claim to be Verizon Wireless subscribers. The Government obviously wants me to infer that the NSA may not have collected records from Verizon Wireless (or perhaps any other non-VBNS entity, such as AT&T and Sprint). Curiously, the Government makes this argument at the same time it is describing in its pleadings a bulk metadata collection program that can function only because it "creates an historical repository that permits retrospective analysis of terrorist-related communications across multiple telecommunications networks, and that can be immediately accessed as new terrorist-associated telephone identifiers come to light."
[....] Put simply, the Government wants it both ways. Virtually all of the Government's briefs and arguments to this Court explain how the Government has acted in good faith to create a comprehensive metadata database that serves as a potentially valuable tool in combating terrorism--in which case the NSA must have collected metadata from Verizon Wireless, the single largest wireless carrier in the United States, as well as AT&T and Sprint, the second and third-largest carriers.... Yet in one footnote, the Government asks me to find that plaintiffs lack standing based on the theoretical possibility that the NSA has collected a universe of metadata so incomplete that the program could not possibly serve its putative function. Candor of this type defies common sense and does not inspire confidence!
The question before me is not the same question that the Supreme Court confronted in Smith. To say the least, "whether the installation and use of a pen register constitutes a 'search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment," ... -- under the circumstances addressed and contemplated in that case--is a far cry from the issue in this case.
Indeed, the question in this case can more properly be styled as follows: When do present-day circumstances--the evolutions in the Government's surveillance capabilities, citizens' phone habits, and the relationship between the NSA and telecom companies--become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court thirty-four years ago that a precedent like Smith simply does not apply? The answer, unfortunately for the Government, is now.
For the many reasons discussed below, I am convinced that the surveillance program before me is so different from a simple pen register that Smith is of little value in assessing whether the Bulk Telephony Metadata Program constitutes a Fourth Amendment search. To the contrary, for the following reasons, I believe that bulk telephony metadata collection and analysis almost certainly does violate a reasonable expectation of privacy.
It's one thing to say that people expect phone companies to occasionally provide information to law enforcement; it is quite another to suggest that our citizens expect all phone companies to operate what is effectively a joint intelligence-gathering operation with the Government.
...the ubiquity of phones has dramatically altered the quantity of information that is now available and, more importantly, what that information can tell the Government about people's lives.... Put simply, people in 2013 have an entirely different relationship with phones than they did thirty-four years ago.
In sum, the Smith pen register and ongoing NSA Bulk Telephony Metadata Program have so many significant distinctions between them that I cannot possibly navigate these uncharted Fourth Amendment waters using as my North Star a case that predates the rise of cell phones.... As I said at the outset, the question before me is not whether Smith answers the question of whether people can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in telephony metadata under all circumstances. Rather, the question that I will ultimately have to answer when I reach the merits of this case someday is whether people have a reasonable expectation of privacy that is violated when the Government, without any basis whatsoever to suspect them of any wrongdoing, collects and stores for five years their telephony metadata for purposes of subjecting it to high-tech querying and analysis without any case-by-case judicial approval.
Well, this is big, big news. Judge Richard Leon, a judge in the DC district court, has ruled that the NSA's bulk metadata collection should be stopped as violating the 4th Amendment , though he's put the ruling on hold, knowing that it will be appealed. This is the first major court ruling concerning the program, and the judge is pretty clear that it's a 4th Amendment violationthe FISA court approved it. The case is actually two different cases brought by Larry Klayman, the founder of Freedom Watch, over the NSA's activities. Here's the key bit:The ruling is worth reading, going through the legal history and details of the program. While it notes that the plaintiffs and the government (not surprisingly) explain the bulk metadata collection very differently, the court says that even if it accepts the government's explanation, it still likely violates the 4th Amendment. That's important.Even while accepting the government's description of the system, it appears, thankfully, that Judge Leon is not being confused and suckered by the government's attempt to mislead. For example, in a footnote (21) the judge shows that he completely understands that the NSA is being exceptionally misleading when itthat within all of that metadata, it's just looking at fewer than 300 individuals.Judge Leon is also well aware of the newly declassified rulings from FISC judges Walton and Bates detailing regular and drastic non-compliance by the NSA. While Judge Leon does admit to lacking jurisdiction over claims that the program violates the Administrative Procedures Act, it's the constitutional questions that are the big ones, and he does not shy away there. He notes that the FISA law does not include an expressed right of judicial review -- but neither does it bar it. And, since Congress "should not be able to cut off a citizen's right to judicial review of... Government action simply because it intended for conduct to remain secret," he finds that the court has the authority to rule on the constitutional issues.On the question of standing (where the government often wins since individuals can't prove they've been spied on), the court sides with the plaintiffs -- noting that there's strong evidence to suggest their info has, in fact, been collected.Judge Leon further mocks the Government's attempts to argue no standing, noting that their own arguments appear to contradict themselves:In terms of the actual constitutional analysis, Judge Leon takes on directly the issue of metadata collection in Smith v. Maryland, the key case that the NSA and its defenders repeatedly rely on to insist that there is no 4th Amendment rights in information stored by third parties. Judge Leon notes that issue here is very different.From there, he relies on the US v. Jones case, which we've discussed extensively as well, in which the court found that attaching a GPS device to a car could be a 4th Amendment violation. He notes there that the court similarly looked at the differences in that case as compared to a previous precedent, and notes that the same situation likely applies here, vis-a-vis comparisons to Smith:He then goes into a detailed and thorough dismantling of Smith and why it clearly doesn't apply to this program -- noting how Smith was a very limited data collection, rather than a "collect it all" process. He even refers to the current program as "Orwellian." Furthermore, he implicates the close relationship between the NSA and the telcos, noting that this is entirely different from Smith, where police made a specific request to the telcos to turn over specific information -- rather than the telcos automatically handing over all info for the NSA to keep.Finally, he points out that the amount of metadata in question is significantly more detailed and revealing than what was captured in the Smith case:In this, it appears that Judge Leon was convinced by Ed Felten's declaration which, as we noted, went into great detail about how much metadata could reveal about a person today.In the end, he says that Smith is simply the wrong case:Finally, in looking at the government's insistence that the program is necessary, Judge Leon is not convinced. He notes examples of them saying it can help them do their job faster, but none of it is actually stopping an attack. In fact, he notes that for all the talk of doing the job faster, there's not been a single shred of evidence presented that it helped stop anattack, where that kind of speed would matter. In fact, he notes, "none of the three 'recent examples' cited by the Government [for the need for this program] involved any apparent urgency." In short, Judge Leon is calling the government's bluff. Their only reason for needing the program is the speed it provides, but then they present no evidence of any cases where that speed was important.Thus, the end result is an injunction against the metadata collection, but recognizing the inevitable appeal, that injunction is stayed pending appeal. This is a very good decision, but this is just the beginning.

The idea came for this when me and friend were playing Metroid prime 3 for old time sakes, and in that space of free time I thought how the phazon though a "poison" or corruption was still effective and useful when managed appropriately. It's clear from the games there's a theme of an arms race, pirates have phazon, so does the federation in turn. The ones that use it constantly do become quite powerful but at the expense of their own being (ie: the hunters)
What occurred to me that constant use isn't the same as controlled use, using it as and when needed does have some payoffs.
So I looked at the phazon as a spectrum, a range of different positions within the same group, with blue phazon being the consequence of constant use of phazon to where it becomes misuse and that person is consumed by that very power and become corrupted (aka Dark Samus)
On the other side of the spectrum was the idea that if Dark Samus is the consequence of misuse then maybe if there was an opposite it would be a samus where the phazon has enhanced her as far she will allow it, she is in total control of the phazon because the duration of controlled use has strengthened her natural tolerance and give her body time time to adapt.
In this case the controlled phazon has enhanced her being, as well as manifesting the Chozo DNA within which is depicted as a orange like colour because that is the colour of the chozo eyes.
Hence Chozo Samus. A polar opposite of Dark Samus.
(Think of it as the fierce deity mask version from legend of Zelda.)
THE BIG BANG THEORY
Sure, the CBS sitcom continued to crack us up, even in its seventh season. But more than that, The Big Bang Theory brought serious character development to the table this year — Sheldon kissed Amy! Raj got a girlfriend! — that had us rooting for these hapless characters even more than ever.
INSIDE AMY SCHUMER
Whether negotiating with Paul Giamatti's (homosexual) God to avoid a case of herpes or providing animation voice-over for a defecating, pants-free and very anatomically correct meerkat, Schumer's second season was always just a little dangerous — but with enough big laughs to justify any possible offense. And indeed, with a wide range of inspirations — the sexism of video games, the ridiculousness of high-end hotels, even the writing and direction of Aaron Sorkin's TV dramas — it was easy to see why guests from Josh Charles to Rachel Dratch to Parker Posey lined up for guest spots on the buzzy Comedy Central hit.
LOUIE
From leaving his daughter alone on a subway platform to saving his elderly neighbor from the elevator, Louie continued to show us just how hilarious and absurd our everyday lives can be — even when they don't seem funny at all. Plus, with moments like his “Fat Girl” monologue, series star Louis C.K. got us actually thinking in between guffaws.
THE MINDY PROJECT
The best romantic comedy of 2014 didn't take place on the big screen, but instead aired Tuesday nights on Fox. Indeed, The Mindy Project‘s vastly improved sophomore season focused squarely on its flawed, titular heroine's search for love — a quest that led her to the top of the Empire State Building (and the arms of her irascible/adorable coworker, Dr. Danny Castellano). Better still, the overarching love story never got in the way of our central lovebirds (or their merry band of supporting players) delivering rapid-fire scalpel-sharp zingers on the regular.
SHAMELESS
The Showtime dramedy's fourth season may not have been its funniest, but it was undoubtedly its best. Navigating the highs and lows of adolescence, substance abuse, bipolar disorder‎, college pressures and more, Shameless proved it can walk the thin line between comedy and drama like no other show on TV.

Mazda has been talking about bringing its 2.2-liter Skyactiv-D diesel engine to the U.S. market for the better part of a decade, and now we finally have a firm date and a confirmed model: 2017, in the new CX-5.
The 2017 CX-5 was unveiled at the L.A. auto show. Mechanical specifications are still scarce, with Mazda at first confirming only that the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine—the mainstay powerplant in the current CX-5—would return and that the current, base 2.0-liter four-cylinder wouldn't. We've also heard rumblings that a manual transmission will be available in the new model.
Now the company is saying that the 2.2-liter diesel will be offered here, starting in the second half of 2017. Again, Mazda is providing no specs, although in other markets the sequentially turbocharged Skyactiv-D makes as much as 173 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque at 2000 rpm. Whether it will be available with the six-speed stick or just the six-speed automatic also remains to be seen. No fuel-economy estimates are available as of yet, with Mazda saying only that the diesel-engine CX-5 would be “one of the most fuel-efficient vehicles in its class.”
Given the poisoned environment for diesels in this country in the wake of the Volkswagen diesel-cheating scandal, Mazda must have a lot of confidence that its Skyactiv-D will make a compelling case to consumers. Mazda told us that the engine will meet our emissions standards, which is good, as it's sure to get plenty of scrutiny from U.S. environmental regulators.
As a young reporter, I once expressed shock at how routinely and reflexively government officials lied to the press. A savvy newspaper vet who overheard me just smiled and told me not to take it personally.
“Why shouldn't they lie to you?” the late, great Murray Kempton asked. “They lie to themselves all the time.”
His observation came back to me as I read about President Obama's trip to Asia. He's going, the White House says, to tell our allies face to face that America is committed more than ever to their security and prosperity.
In ordinary times, the trip and the promise would mean a great deal to the Japanese, South Koreans and Filipinos nervous about trade and China's aggressive military moves. But these are not ordinary times and Barack Obama is no ordinary president.
Consider that it's been three years since Obama first declared a “pivot” to Asia as part of a strategic rebalancing of American interests, but the promise proved hollow. Asia is not alone in feeling misled.
Ask the Syrians about Obama's promise to act if their government crossed his “red line” and used chemical weapons. Or ask Israelis, Saudis, Jordanians and others in the Mideast about Obama's pledge that America would never allow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. Or ask Ukrainians about his pledge that we will stand with them as they fight for democracy against Vladimir Putin.
OK, the last promise wasn't so much a lie as a sick joke. It turns out that by “help,” Obama meant we would send military rations and warm socks, but no weapons or intelligence to help Ukraine's outgunned army.
If that were all the president had done to cause mistrust, it would be enough. But it's not just foreigners who have been misled.
Worst of all, Obama lies to his fellow Americans. All the time.
Most infamous was his claim that, under ObamaCare, “if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.” Not far behind was his insistence, repeated for weeks during his re-election campaign, that the terror attack on Benghazi was the spontaneous result of a protest against an anti-Muslim video.
Assorted promises to lift the economy, unite the country, get to the bottom of the IRS scandal and be transparent are so routinely violated that they hardly register as false anymore.
Still, the overall impression that Obama is President Pinocchio is catching up to him. A Fox News poll showed that over 60 percent of American voters think he intentionally misleads them about important matters some or most of the time.
A whopping 37 percent think he lies “most of the time,” while another 24 percent say he lies “some of the time.” Twenty percent of voters say “only now and then” and 15 percent “never.”
Abraham Lincoln, supposedly an Obama hero, warned about the corrosive effect of failing to be honest. As he famously put it, “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”
That more or less sums up where we are, or, rather, where Obama is. Nearly six years in office, much of the world is united only in not trusting his word.
Even for those inclined to believe, as Murray Kempton did, that a public lie often starts with self-deceit, the impact is enormous. Although it's possible Obama intended to stand up to Syria's Assad, or to Iran's mullahs, or to Putin or China, the fact that he hasn't been all that matters.
The result is that, while the United States remains the lone superpower, we are not feared by the world's most malevolent forces.
We are witnessing the making of a tragic history. The fact that America's leader lacks credibility among friend and foe alike is creating peril without precedent. Absent a sudden stiffening of spine and a president whose word is his bond, the world is heading toward a catastrophe.
That's the truth.
Hey, Bill, just do the math
Mayor Bill de Blasio's bid to squash the charter-school movement never made sense, but new data on students underscores how his policy contradicts his goal of tackling educational inequality.
According to the Independent Budget Office, whites make up only 3 percent of charter-school students, while blacks and Latinos together account for over 90 percent.
The mayor's stance is confounding because the best charters show that poor, nonwhite children can match or surpass whites on standardized tests. In other words, the dream of closing the racial achievement gap is being realized at the schools de Blasio opposes.
If he were a Republican, he'd be called a racist.
It stands to (T) reason
The argument that liberalism is a disease is unfair — to diseases! Take two overheated responses to my column saying the Pulitzer Prize board made treason cool by rewarding news organizations that published Edward Snowden's stolen documents.
The writers praise Snowden for revealing surveillance secrets, but can't stop there. Their politics requires them to make ridiculous comparisons and wish that I suffer for daring to disagree with them.
One writer, identifying himself only as Matthias, claims our government is worse than “what the Stasi inflicted on East Germans,” then adds a favorite lefty cliché with a twist: “I despise what you say but will defend to the death your right to say it, but with the hope you burn in hell.”
The other writer, named only JT, calls me a “son of a bitch who shills for the nazi police state!” After more profanity and homophobic slurs, he adds, “I hope you die soon and VERY soon very very painfully!”
The kooks make my case that the Pulitzer board gave comfort to anti-Americans. People filled with such hatred for their fellow citizens cannot be trusted to protect our nation.
Blood on Al's hands
Reader Frank DeSanna goes back to the 1995 arson fire at Freddie's Fashion Mart, which killed seven workers, to argue that Al Sharpton should never be celebrated. “I am a firefighter in Harlem and I will never forget the fire and Sharpton's role in it,” he writes. “Sharpton's anti-Semitic speech inspired Roland Smith to commit that heinous crime. When will Sharpton be held accountable for the deaths, for which he never took any responsibility?”
Viv's weird Tex message
Ultra-liberal Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito is confused. She denounced a visit by Texas Gov. Rick Perry before it happened, saying his politics are “something New Yorkers will overwhelmingly and easily reject.”
But Perry didn't come to Gotham to sell himself to blue-state voters. He came to sell Texas as a low-tax, pro-business, pro-family state where even Democrats might want to live and create jobs.
Perhaps that's why Mark-Viverito lashed out at Perry. Like a lawyer who has neither the facts nor the law on her side, all she can do is pound the table.
TAMPA, Fla. -- Kellen Winslow's time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers apparently is over.
In an interview with SiriusXM NFL Radio on Monday morning, Winslow said he was told by the team that his services no longer are required. Winslow said he was told the Bucs will attempt to trade him.
"They're not looking for my services this year. (Coach Greg Schiano) said he'd help me out with a trade. It's kind of shocking, but that's what it is," Winslow said.
While Winslow appears on his way out, former Indianapolis Colts tight end Dallas Clark appears to be on his way in with the Bucs.
The veteran tight end worked out for the team last week, and the Bucs are expected to sign him to a contract sometime Tuesday, a league source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.
Clark also has made visits to the Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots.
Winslow, meanwhile, said he was told by the Buccaneers that part of the reason for the decision was that he had not been taking part in offseason workouts with the team.
BERKELEY — The family of a Cal rugby player who was paralyzed at the start of the team's national championship game last spring is condemning a decision by the sport's governing body not to discipline Cal's opponent for causing the injury.

Cal rugby player moves toward recovery after life-changing spinal injury
Cal rugby player paralyzed after injury during championship win Debbie and Jeff Paylor also released a still photo taken moments before their son's head was slammed into the turf May 6, in the early stages of the Varsity Cup championship match against Arkansas State. Two short, graphic video clips were also posted on the father's Facebook page and Robert Paylor's GoFundMe page showing the Cal student's neck bent dramatically forward before the full weight of a group of players crushed down on him.
“We are very disappointed in both the result of this investigation and the duration of time it has taken since Robert's catastrophic injury to come to this decision, nearly five months post injury,” the Paylors said in a statement Sunday. “Without this incident deemed as illegal contact and disciplinary measures taken, it constitutes this action as excusable.”
Calls and emails to USA Rugby were not immediately returned Monday. Online rugby magazine FloRugby said the sport's governing body reviewed various camera angles and photos as part of its probe and concluded that while Arkansas State forwards were reckless, there was no intent to injure, and therefore no red card or further discipline would be issued. During the game, Arkansas State was penalized for “collapsing the maul.”
A maul is similar to a scrum, where a group of players interlocks their arms and heads and push against one another. Players are required to try to stay on their feet and cannot purposely collapse the maul.
Paylor's family questioned USA Rugby's decision, saying that without consequences, the tragedy could happen again.
“Our son is not going to benefit from any change in safety measures or investigation, his days of playing rugby are over,” his mother and father wrote. “Our focus from the beginning has been toward the future safety of rugby players. Ideally, this incident should serve the sport as education and coaching opportunities as a living example of why players should not engage in foul play.”
A still photo and video show an Arkansas State player with his left arm wrapped around Paylor's neck, almost like a head lock. The player does not release the neck as the pile of players goes to the ground.
“We question the definition of intent, as if an arm wrapped dangerously around his neck and not releasing all the way to the ground in a collapsing maul had no intent behind it,” the parents wrote. “If there was no intent, the arm should have released as it was not forced into that position. No one intends this outcome, but it is the result and the reason why tackling at the neck is considered a penalty to the extent of a red card during play.”
In June, Cal's legendary rugby coach, Jack Clark, called Paylor's injury “preventable,” and he was just as pointed Monday.
“The USA Rugby decision is shameful and without merit,” Clark said in an email. “The evidence clearly shows a lengthy flagrant penalty. Dangerous play such as this will result in serious injury more times than not. USA Rugby has failed Robert and failed the game.”
The Paylors also remain upset at Arkansas State.
“It is also shameful how neither the coach nor player responsible for this injury from Arkansas State have sent any condolence or concern personally to Robert,” they wrote.
Arkansas State interim head coach Blake White said his team has promoted the fundraising campaign to assist Paylor.
“As the current interim coach for the Arkansas State rugby team, let me first reiterate the condolences to Robert and the Cal team, which our program expressed earlier this year,” he said in an email. “Regarding questions related to the play, USA Rugby has made its ruling related to the incident, and we will accept what was said related to the event.”
The Paylors also criticized USA Rugby for claiming its probe was hampered by a four-month delay in the investigation, and said key individuals were not contacted.
“This is disturbing to us as we have been requesting this investigation for months only for the betterment of the sport and have not been contacted to provide any information, nor have the referees or both teams involved,” the Paylors wrote. “Policies and procedures surrounding serious injuries should be looked at and changed. We believe (USA Rugby) has failed the sport and its player by not contacting us regarding this investigation.”
Since the injury, more than $768,000 has been raised for Paylor in a GoFundMe account that aims to raise $1 million for his continued care. Dozens of updates show videos of Paylor beginning to use his hands and working with physical therapists.

There is an ancient proverb that goes: “when the wind of change blows, some people build walls, others build windmills”.
In the case of Europe, the wind of change happened to blow these past weeks on its outskirts: Romania saw its biggest demonstrations since the fall of communism in 1989. It made headlines for days all over the world, thanks to colorful and creative street protests against corruption and in support of the rule of law.
Here are at least five things one could learn from the protests
1. It's a matter of perception
We have learned that Europe is not only about Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Warsaw, Prague or Rome. It's first and foremost about people and about people power. Both in the so-called “full” or “flawed” democracies from west to east, from north to south. Outraged, sad and unhappy, Romanians have spent days and nights marching in towns and cities across the country and their #resist movement has been protesting tirelessly for weeks. Old(er)and new generations got together and spoke up. Millions if we are to sum up the overall numbers of the past weeks. Their determination and messages are strong and universal as they focus on issues like dignity, respect, solidarity, hope, democratic values, rule of law, accountability, decency, civic engagement, transparency, conscience. That is on fundamental rights. No wonder that #PeoplePower made in Bucharest has become an inspirational hashtag on social media and thus a brand. Support has grown quite fast as well both in Europe and overseas. Some organised solidarity protests as well or other public events and conferences in different parts of the world; some others spoke up and drew attention on their own problems as well, often similar to those of Romania; some others finally took advantage to learn more about geography and history, feeling they had just discovered a new energetic, creative and surprising corner of the world they were not even aware of. And not only by becoming an inspirational brand a bit everywhere around the world, #PeoplePower made in Bucharest has managed to contrast the deficit in terms of public image both the country and the EU project have been suffering for quite some time. In just a couple of days and without following any elaborated promotional campaigns, expensive communication strategies, PR or lobby decalogues. All free of charge and without denying existing gaps or flows of the system, but simply by telling a story, by focusing on the full half of the bottle, on its strengths.
Several experts in corridor diplomacy envisage (off the record) even a new set of branding opportunities, with changes ahead for public diplomacy and storytelling as well. Especially for Europe, in desperate need of fresh “soft power” capabilities and tools that would eventually re-polish the image of a union in crisis by also focusing on its initial project ‘safeguarding peace and prosperity' fueling not only crisis or distress but also hope, freedom and democratic values. However, the question is who will eventually push forward the Bucharest #PeoplePower “style” and take the opportunity to (re)frame the (new) story.
2. Civic participation and social engagement can (really) make a difference
These events have clearly shown that people power can (still) play a key role in politics. Ever since the end of January, international media outlets have constantly reported from Bucharest that the government's supposed u-turn on its first emergency decree would never have happened without such a huge non-violent and determined pressure from the streets. Their message was simple and straightforward: leaders who act in their own self interest, underhand, can expect to be held to account by the people. With a local “added value' – the creative language of protest: ‘funny, sarcastic, poignant and infinitely inventive', as observers put it. This way, #PeoplePower made in Bucharest has got the world's attention and also support from some EU officials, worried by governmental actions in Bucharest. However, the leaders criticised by the crowd got irritated and invoked conspiracy theories, while drawing attention on the country's president, criticised in turn for being on the protesters' side from the beginning and accused of “dividing the nation”. Moreover, some other fans of the government came forward as well in support of what they called the ‘honest cabinet' they had voted for. Interestingly enough, this other crowd was much smaller in numbers than the anti-governmental one, was not questioning any move to decriminalise corruption and, according to repentant politicians and local reports, was actually organised by the leading party, winner of the past parliamentary elections, which saw a very low turnout.
Against this background, judging by the facts, one can't help but notice that #PeoplePower protests against the government have really had a miraculous effect on ”traditional” voter apathy. For political scientists, it represents a perfect example of direct, participatory democracy, without any right or left ‘label'. However, the question is whether this #PeoplePower could develop new, inventive instruments as well, that would eventually strengthen social engagement and civic participation in the long run. According to political scientists, it would be a major shift not only for this corner of Europe.
3. Unfiltered facts can (really) contrast fake news
In an era in which everybody deplores fake news everywhere, in Bucharest we have seen that journalism's never-ending fight for simple, unfiltered, sacred facts eventually pays off. Despite the tons of information we get on a daily basis from different sources, people eventually reach the climax, refuse to take things for granted and claim their right to be rightfully informed and to wider angles for understanding history. In other words, when exposed to pure facts, fewer people confuse with news all they hear from social media/ read in newspapers/ watch on TV. That is because simple, basic questions (like the traditional 5Ws) don't need complex answers. The question is thus whether we're dealing with a temporary outcome or if #PeoplePower made in Romania can eventually open up new trends on how traditional or social media reporting should fight back against fake news or propaganda. In any case it would not be the first time this off-the-beaten-path corner of Europe, a country full of surprises, would make history as far as media and reporting are concerned: the bloody Romanian Revolution, the last one of the 1989 popular uprisings against communist rule in eastern Europe, was also the first ever live broadcast revolution in TV history.
One thing is sure – the #PeoplePower protests made in Bucharest have proven that non-filtered depictions of reality can eventually contrast fake news. At the end of the day, one cannot underestimate the power of simple questions and answers. Moreover, questioning follow-ups on key issues can really make a difference while scrambling to constantly check and unveil facts from all angles. Even in the age of social media. In other words, less is more.
4. It's important we don't lose sight of the big(ger) picture
Another thing we've learned is that this may be the beginning of a wider story. Corruption is not new, it goes back centuries and has been endemic not only in Romania and Europe. Historians might argue that it has always been like that: indeed, in Europe and around all countries/empires have had their weak rulers, corrupted advisers or greedy officials. From the Ottoman Empire to Imperial Russia, from political corruption in the Roman Empire to the colonial roots of corruption within the British Empire, from the excesses of the French royalty to the persistence of corruption within the Habsburg bureaucracy.
A quick round-up on international news brings forward regularly interesting stories as well – from France's lax ethical standards and nepotism claims to Spain's royals tried for fraud, from Greek fakelaki still going strong to Italian omertà often over corruption or extortion, from German MPs' reluctance history with UN's Convention against Corruption to UK financial centres accused by campaigners of laundering corrupt money from overseas. Against this background, some experts argue that the inspiring protests in Bucharest and their enthusiasm can really be contagious. Other protests against corruption have already been organised in different countries. Some others minimise though the domino effect of the #PeoplePower made in Bucharest, arguing that, in the end, with all its problems, in Europe nobody really cares about this symbolic protests anyway. Brexit, refugees, populism, xenophobia, terrorism, security needs, borders, social inequality, economic challenges, menacing neighbours, reluctant friends, conspiracy fears, ambiguous lobbies and so forth – are just some of the latest European challenges. So why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own?
In this context, the question is how the criticised leaders/government(s) and their (European) partners will eventually deal with the situation. Their reaction can really set the tone for follow ups in the long run and even have collateral effects. One thing became clear though with the latest events: ‘ostrich policies', notoriously counterproductive, could only postpone the issue, without addressing its root causes. Moreover, denials could also complicate the picture, with propaganda messages coming in, while fueling populism or delegitimising the enemy of the “moment” through accusations of double standards.
5. People need (new) role models that inspire and motivate
Rather ironically for (yet) a(nother) story about politicians accused of corruption or of backtracking on the fight against corruption, events in Bucharest have eventually shown just how much effort a country like Romania has been putting in the last years to fighting corruption or countering abuse of office by public servants. According to experts and anti-governmental protesters that took the streets, the process is not a perfect one and still needs adjustments. However not on the substance, not by undermining its core activities. Through ups and downs, the Romanian DNA agency, responsible for fighting corruption has been very active in trying to clean up the country and sent to jail even a former prime minister, dozens of former MPs and businessmen. It's not necessarily on good terms with the current cabinet and with the political party that has just won elections. However, according to local experts, #PeoplePower supporters in Bucharest say they would protest even against this watchdog if allegations of abuse of office on their part came up as well. In other words, nobody should be above the law.
For those singing for change on the streets of Bucharest together with their kids or parents, it's all about education. It's about “education for democracy”, from an early age, perceived as the most appropriate solution for promoting new role models for a better, more decent society. Their example went viral and the German TV channel Zdf came up even with a cartoon for kids and adults, explaining how corruption works and how one should protest against it, just like the Romanians did in the past weeks. In other words, #PeoplePower made in Bucharest has somehow served as a role model. At least in Germany. The question is whether this is a sort of snowball effect throughout Europe and around. Especially in those countries ending up regularly in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index.
I'll stop here for now but this is definitely not the end of the story. My feeling is that the five things learnt these past weeks could help any player advance. Like in the ancient proverb, we'll just have to check the timing and see who builds ‘walls' or ‘windmills' when facing this new wind of change blowing from the east.

ST. LOUIS – Built in 1900, the old Buster Brown Blue Ribbon shoe factory at Cass and Jefferson is one of the last reminders of a time when St. Louis was the shoe manufacturing capitol.
“We started with 137 structures on the 97-acre site and we have already completed demolition on 132 of those structures and we've moved one of those, as you know,” said Otis Williams, executive director of the St. Louis Development Corporation.
In February, Rosetta Taylor's century-old brick house was moved from its North Market home to make way for the National Geospatial Agency. The NGA West campus will be moving into the near northside neighborhood, along with approximately 3,000 employees.
But first, there are buildings and blocks of the city that have to be demolished.
“The building as we know it is all brick, so about 6,000 or 7,000 bricks will be used on the NGA site once they start construction,” Williams said. “So they're saving them and putting them on pallets for future use on the site.”
Minority owned Premier Demolition was awarded the job of taking down the old Brown Shoe building and saving the bricks for reuse in the new NGA campus. The St. Louis Development Corporation estimates it will take eight to 10 months to completely remediate the site before turning it over to the NGA.
“Many of the jobs in the city are hand-wrecked demos,” Williams said. “Many of them are palletized and used elsewhere in the region or shipped away from the city to other locations.”
So to build part of this city's future, you're going to need a good foundation at the new NGA site, and some old Buster Brown bricks.
The U.S. Is Losing 3,000 People A Day To Pokémon Go!
David Vandegrift Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 13, 2016
At this point, assuming you're under the age of 70, you've heard of Pokémon Go, the augmented reality mobile game sweeping the world by storm. The game is fascinating for a number of reasons, not least of which is its ability to turn grown men into nostalgic 10 year old boys. But by far one of the most interesting effects so far is that it has managed to accomplish what not even Michelle Obama could: it's getting Americans off their fat butts to walk around outside.
But what does that actually mean for our society? Surely folks walking around for a few extra minutes over the course of the day doesn't really make a difference, right?
Well, they (I) did the math.
As of yesterday (July 12), Pokémon Go had reached 21 million daily active users in the US, making it the most popular mobile game ever (did I mention it came out like 5 days ago?).
More impressive? Those 21 million Americans are playing the game for an average of 43 minutes per day.
If you assume that the average American is 180 lbs, burns about 100 calories per mile walked, and is walking about half the time they're playing, then you come up with a total of about 2,000,000,000 calories burned. Yesterday.
That's 571,000 pounds walked off. Yesterday. 3,174 average Americans. Walked off. Because of a game.
Extrapolate based on Pokémon Go's continued astronomical user growth rate and spread to the rest of the world, and you're looking at tens of thousands of human equivalents of fat lost per day. Millions lost per year.

I'll leave it to the reader to think about other things society is losing among those numbers (did I mention 21 million Americans played a videogame for 43 minutes yesterday?).
There's a part of cycling that is intrinsically an act of faith.
It happens the first time a child launches off on a two-wheeler. Not just on the part of the girl or boy asked to believe they can stay upright. But of the parent who has to finally let go of the saddle.
The more you bike, the more you and everyone who loves you has to put the faith part of the safety equation into the background.
But every once in a while, it rears its ugly head, as it did for Patrick Brown this past weekend.
The Toronto lawyer lives far from the winding rural road north of Whistler where an allegedly impaired driver plowed into two descending cyclists.
But Brown is a biker too. And that's enough.
"We've all been on those downhill descents. We've all come around a corner. And we're always thinking and hoping that people driving their vehicles are conscious that we are on the road and we are there," he says.
"And if you ride and you've been in that situation, you do understand just how close you are to bad consequences."
Roads made for cars
Kelly Blunden and Ross Chafe died when a car apparently veered into their lane. A passenger in the vehicle also died and the driver was badly injured.
The incident is a sad reminder of just how dangerous Canadian roads and highways remain for cyclists — despite advances in urban centres.
Cities like Vancouver and Montreal have introduced separated bike lanes and campaigns aimed at getting people out of their cars.
Ontario member of the legislature Eleanor McMahon has been fighting for change in Ontario to make cycling safer since her husband was killed in a 2006 crash. (CBC)
But many cyclists would like to go further afield. And unpaved shoulders, breakneck traffic and a lack of respect from drivers mean they are taking their lives in their hands when they do so.
"I think it's in part based on our infrastructure," says Brown.
"I think it's the way our laws have been focused primarily on cars, as opposed to recognizing that the roads are increasingly used by cyclists."
'We need to ask for more'
Brown was one of the forces behind a groundbreaking 2012 Ontario coroner's review into 129 cyclist deaths between 2006 and 2010.
The review called for legislative and legal changes, as well as a "complete streets" approach to road safety throughout the province, taking into account the needs of all road users in street and community design.
As a lead investigator with the Cycling in Cities research program, University of British Columbia. professor Kaye Teschke says Canada lags behind European countries in recognizing the needs of cyclists.
She says research shows Canada has higher traffic injury rates for all modes of transport per capita, per trip and per distance than the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.
And when accidents do happen on fast roads, the research shows, they're inevitably more catastrophic for cyclists: bike helmets and Lycra being no match for tonnes of metal and glass.
"We need to ask for more," she says.
"At one time in cities, we asked for painted bike lanes on our main streets. Now cyclists are saying: 'No, we need physically separated bike lanes in the city.' We need the same thing alongside highways."
1-metre passing law
Ontario member of the legislature Eleanor McMahon became a cycling advocate after a motorist with five convictions for driving while suspended struck and killed her husband, Greg Stobbart, during a training ride in 2006.
She spearheaded provincial legislation, set to be passed into law Tuesday, which will force motorists to give cyclists one metre of space when passing.
"Part of what makes us vulnerable when we're on a bicycle, in the country anyway, is the fact that we haven't had the infrastructure in place to create the kind of society that sees cycling as a benefit," she says.
"We're still really struggling in Canada with the cars versus cycling conversation."
McMahon says the potential involvement of alcohol may ultimately make the Whistler tragedy as much about impaired driving as cycling.
But drunk drivers are sadly still part of the mix cyclists face.
Brown says that's one of the reasons many advocates want cyclists designated "vulnerable road users": "If a cyclist is killed on the streets, the law would reflect an added penalty."
Teschke says cyclists have a right to feel safe on the road, no matter where in the country they are. Her heart is with the families of the Whistler victims.
"It's heartbreaking," she says.
"It shouldn't happen. It shouldn't be a consequence of getting around."
The immoral wealthy have a new and tasteless toy: ancient olive trees adorning the gardens of their villas.
According to an investigative report by journalist Maya Zinshtein published in the Haaretz Hebrew edition on Monday, for around a decade now, illegal trade in ancient olive trees - including uprooting, stealing and smuggling them from the West Bank into Israel - has been flourishing.
It is a market worth millions of shekels a year, in which a single tree can command tens of thousands of shekels. The Haaretz report uncovered suspicions of criminal activities in this regard, along with an ugly greediness for pet trees that has nothing to do with the love of the land and its arboreal species.
Olive trees, one of the most beautiful and symbolic hallmarks of the land of Israel, have also become a status symbol for the upper thousandth percentile of the population. As a result, they are being uprooted from their natural surroundings, where they should have remained planted forever, ruining the landscape on both sides of the Green Line.
It is illegal to uproot and transport ancient trees without authorization. Many trees have been stolen from their owners in the territories, and in other cases, heavy pressure is brought to bear on Palestinian farmers to sell their trees, taking advantage of their powerlessness and making huge profits at their expense.
The government department in charge of enforcing the law pertaining to flora and fauna is partially paralyzed; a senior member of its staff owns a nursery, has a criminal record, and is suspected of taking bribes and of illegal trade in trees.
The state comptroller intends to soon publish a report on this department. But beyond the criminal nature of this commerce, the environmental and public aspects of this scandal cannot be ignored.

Uprooting ancient olive trees, which have been planted for centuries in public areas and have been an inseparable part of the scenery of the Galilee and the West Bank, and moving them to the private gardens of wealthy homeowners, rides roughshod over the landscape and heritage of this country.
Uprooting trees that farmers have tended for centuries and moving them to homes whose owners have no relationship to the land or to agriculture, is infuriating and improper. It is incumbent on the Agriculture Ministry and the Civil Administration to take immediate action to stop the theft of trees and the destruction of the landscape.
Donald Trump's campaign released a memo on Tuesday that said it would force Mexico to pay for a border wall by threatening to cut off billions of dollars in money transfers that Mexicans who are living in the U.S. send home.
How Trump plans to make Mexico pay for the wall
"Mexico currently receive $24 billion in remittance payments annually from the United States. This provides substantial leverage for the United States to obtain from Mexico the funds necessary to pay for a border wall," his campaign said in a statement.
If elected president, the memo explains, Trump would threaten to change a rule under the Patriot Act to cut off some of the money Mexico receives through wire transfers. The memo said the majority of the $24 billion a year "comes from illegal aliens" that they send back to their families.
But if Mexico agrees to make a one-time payment for the border wall, Trump's campaign said he wouldn't move forward with the rule change.
"It's an easy decision for Mexico: make a one-time payment of $5-10 billion to ensure that $24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year," the memo says.
The Mexican central bank said Mexicans living abroad sent nearly $25 billion home to their families last year, according to The Washington Post. But a Government Accountability Office report from earlier this year found that it's difficult to track how much money Mexicans living illegally in the U.S. send home versus those who live here legally.
Trump regularly tells voters he'll make Mexico pay for the wall, but this memo has more detail than he has ever offered on how he'd actually do it. The memo even has a brief timeline: on day one, he'd announce the proposed rule change to the Patriot Act; on day two, Mexico "will immediately protest;" and on day three, Trump would tell Mexico that if it pays for the wall, he won't make the rule change.
Trump's memo also claims that the U.S. has leverage through business and tourist visas "for important people in the Mexican economy" and the U.S. could increase visa fees, such as on border crossing cards, to finance the wall.
Since last year, the GOP presidential frontrunner has insisted that he would make Mexico pay for the wall along the U.S.'s southern border. This isn't the first time Trump has released a memo on his make-Mexico-pay plan, but the idea of amending the Patriot Act to cut off remittance payments and canceling visas is new.
Mexico's government, meanwhile, has made it clear that it wouldn't pay for the wall Trump is proposing. A spokesman for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told Bloomberg last August that Trump's plan "reflects an enormous ignorance for what Mexico represents and also the irresponsibility of the candidate who's saying it." Last month, Mexican Treasury Secretary Luis Videgaray said Mexico "emphatically and categorically" won't pay for it.

Mighty Servant 2 was a 29,000-ton semi-submersible, heavy-lift ship operated by Dockwise. The ship drew worldwide attention in 1988 for transporting the mine-damaged USS Samuel B. Roberts from Dubai to Newport, Rhode Island.
The ship was built in 1983 by Oshima Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. in Ōshima, Japan, for Dutch shipping firm Wijsmuller Transport, which merged in 1993 with Dock Express Shipping to become Breda-based offshore heavy lifting group Dockwise Shipping B.V. The vessel capsized in 1999 and was scrapped in 2000.
Service [ edit ]
Mighty Servant 2 was capable of carrying the heaviest semi-submersible drilling units, harsh-environment deep-water jack-up rigs and large floating production tension-leg platforms, semi-submersibles and spars with drafts of up to 14 metres.[2] Most of the ship's cargoes were oil platforms and related gear. When loading its mammoth burdens, the ship took thousands of tons of water into ballast tanks, submerging its cargo deck underwater. The cargo would be floated into position, whereupon Mighty Servant 2 would slowly pump out its ballast, lifting the deck up to sailing position.
USS Samuel B. Roberts [ edit ]
Her most famous job was the July 1988 haulage of the U.S. Navy's USS Samuel B. Roberts from Dubai to Newport, Rhode Island after the guided missile frigate struck a mine in the Persian Gulf on 14 April 1988.[3][4] The 125-meter frigate barely fit on Mighty Servant 2's cargo deck; holes had to be cut to accommodate the frigate's sonar dome and stabilizing fins. The loading, which was supervised by divers and underwater video monitors, took about 12 hours, with gaps measured in mere centimetres. About 20 of the frigate's 200-man crew remained aboard during the 8,100-mile, 30-day voyage. The USS Fahrion escorted the USS Samuel B. Roberts from Dubai through the Straits of Hormuz. The job received worldwide media coverage.[6][7]
Sister ships [ edit ]
Mighty Servant 2 had two sister ships, Mighty Servant 1, built in 1983, and Mighty Servant 3, built in 1984. Both were built for Wijsmuller Transport.
On 6 December 2006, Mighty Servant 3 sank in 62 metres (203 ft) of water near the port of Luanda, Angola, while offloading the drilling platform Aleutian Key. There were no casualties. In August 2009, Dockwise Shipping reported it had been returned to service.[8]
Incidents and accidents [ edit ]
1999 capsizing [ edit ]
Mighty Servant 2 capsized and sank on 2 November 1999 near the Indonesian island of Singkep ( ). The ship was en route from Singapore to Cabinda, Angola, bearing the North Nemba Topsides 8,790-ton offshore production module. The vessel tipped onto its side in 35 metres (115 ft) of water in reportedly calm seas. A hydrographic survey of the area later discovered an unmarked single isolated pinnacle of granite directly on the ship's course. Five crew members died, including two Dutch and two Filipino men. Mighty Servant 2 was declared a total loss.[9] In 2000, the wreck was renamed T 2, transported to Alang, India, and scrapped.[10]

Yesterday, we welcomed 231 energetic members into the first ever FEMA Corps class. The members just finished off their first month of training with our partners at the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) and are one step closer to working in the field on disaster response and recovery. They will now head to FEMA's Center for Domestic Preparedness to spend the next two weeks training in their FEMA position-specific roles. Once they complete both the CNCS and FEMA training, these 231 dedicated FEMA Corps members will be qualified to work in one of a variety of disaster related roles, ranging from Community Relations to Disaster Recovery Center support.
FEMA Corps builds on the great work of AmeriCorps to establish a service cadre dedicated to disaster response and recover. To be sure, responding to disasters is nothing new for AmeriCorps. In fact, the great work that AmeriCorps already does during disasters was the inspiration for FEMA Corps. When I visited communities all over the country that were devastated by disasters, from Joplin, MO to Bastrop, Texas, I always encountered the incredible members of AmeriCorps lending a helping hand to survivors. I was continually struck by the level of compassion, dedication, and skill these members brought to the table.
The inductees are pioneers, combining the exceptional record of citizen service at AmeriCorps' National Civilian Community Corps with FEMA's specialized mission of supporting survivors with their recovery after a disaster. The new members, who range in age from 18-24 years old, will contribute to a dedicated, trained, and reliable disaster workforce by working full-time for ten months on federal disaster response and recovery efforts. As we announced in March, FEMA Corps sets the foundation for a new generation of emergency managers; it promotes civic engagement and offers an educational and financial opportunity for young people; and is designed to strengthen the nation's disaster response by supplementing FEMA's existing Reservist workforce.
I commend and thank every member of the inaugural class of FEMA Corps for their dedication to helping communities in need. Welcome to FEMA Corps!
To learn more about the new program, visit the AmeriCorps website or our FEMA Corps page.
The discredited stem cells known as STAP cells were ultraflexible because they were really embryonic stem cells, a new report contends.
Last January, researchers claimed in two papers published in Nature that they had made stem cells by briefly dipping adult cells in a dilute acid bath or by giving the cells a squeeze (SN: 2/22/14, p. 6). The research was soon called into question, and an investigation by RIKEN, the Japanese research institute where much of the work was done, found lead author Haruko Obokata guilty of manipulating images and plagiarizing parts of the text. The papers were retracted in July (SN: 7/26/14, p. 7).
After months of failing to replicate her work, Obokata resigned and RIKEN said it would cease efforts to re-create the cells.
On December 26, RIKEN issued a report saying that what the researchers claimed were STAP cells were really embryonic stem cells contaminating the lab dishes. The contamination probably wasn't accidental, but exactly who was responsible for it could not be determined. The investigators found Obokata guilty of two more counts of misconduct for fabricating data.
The report may close the book on a year-long saga that has marred stem cell science (SN: 12/27/14, p. 25).
"Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college."
Hillary Clinton is contrasting her plan to overhaul federal assistance for tuition at public colleges with her potential GOP rivals by saying Republicans haven't even considered the issue.
"Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college," said in an Aug. 23, 2015, tweet. "Disappointing, but not surprising."
What is a little surprising to PolitiFact Florida is that Clinton's tweet omits at least one candidate who has made college costs a major platform plank — the Sunshine State's Sen. Marco Rubio.
Rubio said as much by tweeting back the same day, saying Clinton "can't lecture me on student loans. I've had student loans & I have a plan to modernize higher ed." He then linked to a statement on his website excoriating Clinton for planning to put tax dollars into an "outdated system."
Clinton's own idea is a 10-year, $350 billion plan called the "New College Compact." Clinton proposed in August to allow students to attend public colleges without taking out loans to pay tuition. Families would be required to contribute and federal spending would be expanded, but with controls on spending by colleges and universities. Clinton's campaign has not offered many details beyond the price tag and told PolitiFact Florida they had nothing to add to her tweet.
Rubio has been talking about the issue since at least February 2014, when he made a major policy speech about controlling crippling college debt. He repeated his positions in a July speech after he declared his candidacy.
His plan includes several specific ideas:
Establishing a new accreditation process for nontraditional education. Rubio has not said what these "innovative, low-cost competitors" are, but they are generally considered to be for-profit universities, online courses and others.
Requiring schools to tell students what kind of salary they can expect to earn with every degree.
Basing loan repayment plans on the amount of money a graduate makes annually.
Allow student investment plans, in which investors would pay for a student's tuition in exchange for a percentage of their post-graduation income for a number of years, whether that covers the investment or not.
Expanding apprenticeship and vocational programs for students who don't want or need to go to a tradition two- or four-year college.
Some other candidates have also brought up tuition increases, student debt and federal spending on higher education. In June, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie laid out several ideas for reforming post-secondary education with an eye on reining in costs.
Christie suggested itemized tuition bills that detailed what the money was paying for; allowing students to pay just for classes and not facilities or add-ons; and letting students obtain private financing for college with an option to pay it back with a percentage of earnings after graduation. He also floated ideas of providing tax credits for apprenticeship programs and for donating to debt reduction organizations that help students pay for schooling in exchange for community service.
Carly Fiorina, the former technology executive, said in a July Q&A on Breitbart.com that student debt was out of control because "the federal government under Democrats has nationalized the student loan business." She suggested letting private banks compete for student loans. She also said the accreditation process should allow for more for-profit universities and online courses.
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said in April 2015 he thought college tuition should be tax deductible, although he did not offer specifics of how that plan should work.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush earlier in August sparred with Clinton on Twitter about tuition, while Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, in February wrote a Washington Times editorial suggesting needy people should get jobs if they require help paying for college.
Other candidates have been even less vocal on the subject, saying simply that college costs are a problem that have been dealt with, or nothing at all.
Our ruling
Clinton said, "Not one of the 17 GOP candidates has discussed how they'd address the rising cost of college."
While some Republican hopefuls haven't had much to say on the issue, it's not accurate to say none of them have. Rubio has made higher education spending a major plank of his campaign, and other candidates like Christie and Fiorina have set forth ideas and positions. Other candidates have at least mentioned the subject at times.
We rate Clinton's statement False.
Some breaking news in DC Tech was announced Monday morning by tech incubator 1776 on Twitter. General Assembly and 1776 are teaming up to offer technology startup courses at the offices of 1776 Campus in downtown Washington D.C.
Excited to be partnering with @GA to offer classes and workshops starting this fall right here in #DC http://t.co/bON11yRps9 — 1776 (@1776dc) September 9, 2013
1776 has been a heavily touted incubator for tech in Washington with plenty of support from Mayor Gray and the dozens of tech startups (think Hinge) that have set up shop in their space down at 1133 15th Street, NW. General Assembly, an educational organization focused on business and technology, will begin offering courses and workshops in early October at 1776's campus. These will include varied topics on startups and technology including web development. Most of the courses listed run between $75 and $125, with some local 1776 names behind them including Hinge's own developer, Clay Wardell.
According to the press release, General Assembly originally considered DC as a campus for operations but prioritized expansion to some of their nine other campuses, the others in places closeby like NYC and reaching as far as Hong Kong and Sydney.
“At General Assembly, we are bringing together a global community of talented, ambitious individuals, and providing them with the skills that they need to succeed in today's 21st century economy,” said General Assembly Co-Founder and CEO Jake Schwartz. “There is no shortage of ambitious talent in Washington, and we are thrilled to partner with 1776 to add D.C. as the ninth General Assembly campus in our global network.”
While the nod of approval took seven months to get General Assembly on board, it's clear the partnership with 1776 and the strategy behind it will bring more power to the DC technology sector, as well as a steady stream of income to the growing number of start-ups incubated at 1776, not to mention an audience of people thirsty for sexy-startup knowledge.
This initiative will also be paired with 1776's plans to launch an Accelerator program to educate entrepreneurs on “scaling distribution, refining business models, and navigating regulatory threats and opportunities,” through a three month program that also could have a seed fund set up for young tech startups.

The 1990s brought us Seinfeld, the World Wide Web, cell phones, and grunge. But the best thing to come out of the 1990s in my opinion were the amazing sports coupes.
Most of the best were out of Japan, and one of my favorites was the Mitsubishi 3000GT. The car was absolutely beautiful, and it's looks hold up even today. It had a wide stance, excellent handing, and was available in a variety of trim styles which includes a convertible, and most notably an All-Wheel-Drive VR-4 edition. They also made it as a Dodge Stealth, which I don't find as attractive, the main difference being flip-up headlights rather then fixed ones.
Also notable was the Nissan 300ZX (Z32). These tend to be the cheapest of the great sports coupes you can find on the second-hand market, but the Twin Turbo edition still garners a pretty penny. Like the Mitsubishi, they were widely known for mechanical problems, but all was forgotten once you took the T-Tops off on a sunny day.
I don't have statistics for it, but based on how many I see on the road, the Mazda RX-7 (FD) seems to be the rarest of the coupes from this age. It continued the RX tradition from the 80s, with a very nice (although somewhat forgettable) appearance upgrade.
Finally, my favorite Japanese coupe from this generation of the 90s: The Toyota Supra (Mark IV). These are getting especially hard to find in an unmodified state, and unmodified Twin Turbo with T-tops can cost upwards of $30-40k with low mileage. With it's outlandish “whale tale” spoiler, the Supra Twin Turbo was not a shy car appearance-wise, especially if you opted for the gold package. Of the great Japanese sports coupes, these tend to be the most expensive, most likely because they were also the most reliable.
All good things must come to an end, and all of these cars were killed off in the early 2000s (although the Nissan and Mazda did return). I'm not sure why sports coupes fell out of favor, but this group of cars from the 1990s were a rare bout of styling renaissance not seen since the 1960s, and the bold styles carried over into other cars we see today.
ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's behind-the-scenes efforts to shore up support for his handling of an anticorruption panel inadvertently landed him in an even greater bind last week, prompting a scathing rebuke from the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan.
But it also shined a spotlight on a covert public relations tactic that has been used by Mr. Cuomo's aides, who are keenly sensitive to how their boss will be portrayed in the news media.
The strategy — getting allies to send journalists laudatory statements, seemingly of their own volition — is one that, by showing no fingerprints of the governor's aides, would seem to increase the credibility of the praise.
Reporters were bombarded in February, for example, with statements from supporters of a plan by the governor to finance college classes for prison inmates, which he later abandoned after resistance from lawmakers.
by R.P. McCabe
Tulagi – Guadalcanal – November 1942 – PFC Willie (Bill) McCabe: I don't know every detail; too painful. Uncle Bill spoke of his ordeal in halting bits and pieces…eyes filled with tears. I'd pour him a little more Wild Turkey, Kentucky straight bourbon whisky, 101 proof. We'd sip quietly a while.
Buna Beach – New Guinea – February 1943 – PFC Willie (Bill) McCabe: On occasion he'd break out a box of tattered and bent black and white Kodak photographs of the pigmy people of New Guinea, women bare to the waist, the aboriginal men in loin clothes, oblivious to the concept of war except to the extent they got mowed down when the Japanese and Americans started shooting. A couple of GIs, kids actually, big toothy grins, steel helmets pushed back on their heads, cigarettes dangling out of their lips, arms across each others shoulders. Uncle Bill's eyes would tear up once more. “They never made it out of that Godforsaken hellhole,” he'd say and take another long pull of Wild Turkey.
Bataan – Philippine Islands – January 1944 – Corporal Willie (Bill) McCabe: The campaign to recapture Bataan went well into the winter and spring of 1945. Uncle Bill would hang his head, elbows on his knees. “What do you say we have another taste o' Turkey?” I'd pour. My Aunt Ruth, sitting quietly, listening from her favorite easy chair, would look over the tops of her glasses at the two of us. “Bill,” she'd say sing-song, her voice rising in pitch as she went from the ‘B' to the ‘l' in his name. And Uncle Bill would tell me again in herky-jerky installments, the horrors he witnessed at the liberation of the POWs on Bataan.
And yet my Uncle Bill never turned into a xenophobe. Never expressed hatred toward the Japanese people or the colored boys, as he referred to them, who fought on those islands with him. Uncle Bill was a good Baptist, which is to say, took his spirituality to be a personal matter between him and God as he saw him, but thought most churchgoers were a little too caught up in the fantasy of the good book.
My Uncle Bill died February 2009. He was 84 years old. 1924 – 2009; end of a generation. Fell off the top rung of his stepladder taking down the Christmas lights. Landed on his head and broke his damn neck! I was able to fly out to Albuquerque to see him before he checked out. Never made it out of the hospital. His wife, Aunt Ruth died the year before. Went down the hall to use the phone. When she seemed gone overlong, Uncle Bill went to have a look. There she sat…according to Uncle Bill…just slid right down beside the wall when her ticker gave up on her. Poured himself a glass of Wild Turkey, went and sat with her a spell before he had to let 'em come for her.
My Uncle Bill and Aunt Ruth weren't much for complaining about what lay before them or the cards they were dealt. There were hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, of Uncle Bills & Aunt Ruths born during the 1920s; educated, well-balanced people who figured their rights ended where yours begin; never understood the concept of the HOA, knew it to be a damn Republican plot to destroy the peace of enjoying your own property. They accepted the challenges in front of them to give us the America we had before George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, their neocon cronies and the elitist billionaires of Wall Street decided to take America back to a time before World War II. That really did piss Uncle Bill off. All his and Ruth's hard work and sacrifice mostly down the drain; not to mention those boys back on New Guinea. I'll bet you have an Uncle Bill & Aunt Ruth, too. I think you know what I mean.
Our Uncle Bills & Aunt Ruths brought America through the Great Depression after the barons of Wall Street destroyed the financial fabric of the nation. Sound familiar? Our Uncle Bills & Aunt Ruths rebuilt a nation, industrialized America, educated its children, gave us social security and Medicare because they respected and cared about the dignity of their parents and grandparents, knew the abuses of their Wall Street overlords and the vagaries of poverty and the struggles of hard-working Americans, saved millions of human lives through advances in science and medicine, Built highways and bridges that were safe to drive on and connected a nation, innovated art and music and movies, advanced women's rights, ended segregation and gave us civil rights and human rights, gave us fair labor practices and wages and nurtured the transition into the technical age. Hell they put men on the moon! Their list of accomplishments is so long I would not be able to list the entirety of them in five single spaced pages. Essentially, they gave us all the things the Tea Party assholes refuse to support or even take care of…worse yet, want to take away from us, calling them entitlements.
Our Uncle Bills & Aunt Ruths were faced with the same kinds of despicable criminal, xenophobic, homophobic, blacklisting extremist assholes that we are faced with in our government today. Their Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Paul Broun was a two bit cheese-ball criminal by the name of Joe McCarthy and his extremist criminal cronies.By the way, (R) Senator Wisconsin…any similarity there? Their Rush Douchebag was Walter Winchell.
Like the cast of sleaze-bags we are currently fighting against in our government, McCarthy and his cronies were out to turn America into their own definition of extremist Puritan religious theocracy. Anybody who wouldn't accept their dogma was a commie, socialist, fascist, queer…branded, called before their pogrom committees, lives destroyed, ability to work taken from them. Sound like anything you've seen lately?
McCarthyites called themselves Patriots, the same as this current bunch of religious, gun-toting, racist extremists and their supporters. But they didn't fool Uncle Bill & Aunt Ruth. In February 1950 America got rid of Joseph McCarthy and his gang of political cronies when he was Censured and removed from the Senate of the United States. Uncle Bill & Aunt Ruth stayed the course…did what they had to do to preserve the America they fought for and rebuilt; the America of our Constitution and Bill of Rights, not the phony bastardized version of McCarthy and his gang just like this current dipshit Michele Bachmann and her cronies. (Breaking News: Rumored, at CPAC, Bachmann and Palin do lesbian sex and Limbaugh and Beck are doing pony rides with each other in the rectory–come on–I didn't say rectum! Not like I'm reporting this without checking my facts. I called Fox News and Hannity gave a full confirmation on all of it. Journalistic standards of Fox News have been applied. So I know this story is truth! Good to go!)
We have a bunch of lowlifes in our government again these days. They call themselves Patriots, but they aren't. (Louie Gohmert…Patriot…are you shitting me?) They're criminals, the same as their predecessors were. It is our responsibility now to stand our watch, take down these pretenders to freedom and equality and take our government back. Our fight won't be easy but neither was the fight our Uncle Bills & Aunt Ruths fought. They didn't quit until they'd chased the criminals from the halls of their government and neither should we rest until the dirtbags of the Tea Party are brought to a state of ridicule so harsh they'll want to self-deport themselves.
Where would they go? Why, that paradise in the desert Howdy Doody & Shotgun Cheney invaded; spent two trillion American dollars and the lives of more than 4000 young Americans to secure. The land of “Mission Accomplished”, where they can have all the assault rifles and grenade launchers they want; a place where they will be greeted as liberators and gasoline will be $.25 per gallon. The place they used to destroy the American economy and take away our personal freedoms with fear mongering and lies. A place where Paul Wolfowitz and Wayne LaPierre can stand guard at the gates of the schools their kids attend keeping those classrooms safe with their shoulder fired missile launchers.
Now…`Ole Howdy and Shotgun may have a little trouble traveling over in that part of the world. You see, Interpol has multiple arrest warrants against Dick Cheney as a war criminal. Switzerland has issued a war crimes warrant against ‘Ole Howdy himself. Their cronies in our government don't want you to see them the way Uncle Bill & Aunt Ruth saw the evil of WWII tried and punished. The dirtbags of the Tea Party would have you hail these criminals and their current supporters in Congress as Patriots…as heroes, because…the guy in the White House is black…Muslim…not one of us…or at best…impure, as it were.
Look, my Uncle Bill would say, “We gotta liberate this island! Only way we can do that…eliminate the enemy. Let's get to it!” And friends, they are the enemy. These are not representatives of a constituency interested in democracy. These are extremists bent on forcing their brand of America down your throat. They figure their rights continue right on into your homes, your kid's education, your workplace, your marriage, your daughter's and wives' vaginas. http://www.hulu.com/watch/404167
The way we beat these vermin…the way we rid ourselves of them is to put faces with names. Call them what they are; ignorant and stupid. Refuse to afford them the dignity of calling them Patriots instead of the criminals they are, and that includes their supporters in the streets. Identify them. Call them out. Refuse on every level to allow them to pretend that they are good Americans interested in the common good. We must confront them and work tirelessly to keep the light shining on what it is they are really up to.
We beat the billionaires in 2012. We can beat gerrymandering in 2014 if we dig in.

Spread it around: nut butters are a great way to add nutrition and flavor to plant-based recipes. And it's not just about peanut butter, anymore. These days, you'll find creamy butters made from almonds, cashews, pecans, walnuts, and more, as well as seed butters made with sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. There's even soy nut butter for those with nut and seed allergies. Specialty nut butters are also popular with enticing flavor combos, such as chocolate-sunflower seed butter, chocolate-hazelnut butter, and vanilla-espresso almond butter. Nut butters are also easy and economical to make at home using a food processor or high-speed blender.
We all know how great nut butters taste slathered on our favorite bread or baked into homemade cookies. But nut butters go way beyond toast. From spicy Asian sauces to hearty African stews, here are 10 great ways to use them in your cooking. Warning: you may never buy a jar of peanut butter again.
1. In spreads & dips
Instead of the familiar tahini-based hummus, try something different like garbanzo beans blended with almond butter and a splash of Sriracha sauce. Use walnut butter to make spinach-walnut crostinis as an appetizer, or combine cashew butter with artichokes for a luscious artichoke-cashew dip.
2. In soups
Just a small amount of nut butter can add a creamy richness to soups such as a pumpkin-pecan soup with pecan butter croutons or artichoke-walnut butter bisque.
3. In sauces
Nut butters can be used in a wide variety of sauces to top vegetables, pasta, or your favorite plant-based protein. Try grilled vegetables with an almond Romesco sauce, baked tofu with a tahini sauce, penne with an avocado-cashew cream, or slather some pecan butter sauce over a baked sweet potato.
4. In salad dressings
Nut butters can turn simple salads from so-so to sensational. How about a cashew goddess dressing to top a hearty Niçoise salad or a macadamia-rum dressing to drizzle over a tropical fruit salad?
5. In smoothies
A spoonful of nut butter adds protein and flavor to your morning smoothie. Create refreshing and creamy treats such as a cashew-pineapple smoothie or maybe an almond butter-banana shake.
6. In main dishes
The sky's the limit when it comes to using nut butters in your main dish meals, from a vegetable-cashew korma or tropical chickpea-Brazil nut stew to a satisfying chestnut vegetable pot pie.
7. At breakfast
Start the day with a little help from your nut butter friends: swirl some almond butter or walnut butter into your morning oatmeal or add nut butter to a batch of muffins. On the weekend, treat yourself to some maple-pecan butter waffles with pecan maple syrup or a stack of apple-almond butter pancakes.
8. In desserts
Sure, we all know about peanut butter cookies and peanut butter pie, but other nut butters can also do dessert deliciously. Make a simple pecan butter topping for ice cream or a dazzling chocolate-almond butter cheesecake. Or whip up a batch of chocolate-cashew mousse, make an apple-walnut butter crumble, or swirl your favorite nut butter into a batch of brownie batter for added decadence.
9. In dairy alternatives
Cashew butter, with its mild flavor, is perhaps the most versatile of all the nut butters. Use it to make vegan cream cheese, sour cream, and mayonnaise.
10. And, of course, in sandwiches
Move beyond the classic PB&J with winning sandwich options such as roasted eggplant pita with garlicky lemon-walnut sauce, peach-almond butter quesadillas, or Thai tofu-vegetable wraps with a hazelnut drizzle.

Donald Trump slammed the the media as "disgraceful" and "unbelievably dishonest" on Sunday, singling out CNN as the "Clinton News Network."
"I've got tremendous confidence and tremendous respect for certain reporters," Trump said in an interview on Fox News. "But a large portion of the media is disgustingly dishonest. I could name every one of them that are that way, and probably someday I will, but they ... should be ashamed of themselves."

"I'm very proud of the fact at rallies we'll have 10,000 and 15 and 20,000 or more, I will call the media out," Trump added. "I think the word has gotten through ... if you take a look at what's happened, how could that happen if people really believe the media? Because all they want to do is write negatively about me. It is so biased.
"We talked about CNN. It's called the Clinton News Network ... it is so biased it's ridiculous, and they're very dishonest, very dishonest people, so I called them out and I'm very proud of it. And now I see the [media's] poll numbers are at an all-time low, and frankly I think I had something to do with that, but I'm very proud of it."
A Gallup poll released this week found just 32 percent of Americans have a "great deal" or "fair amount" of trust in the media, while 27 percent said they had no trust. The numbers represent a record low for the media since Gallup began conducting the survey in 1972.
Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 was released early this morning and the update includes several changes that have huge implications for Bitcoin scalability. The release deploys the first soft fork on the Bitcoin network to use the methodology outlined in BIP 9 (Version Bits), which allows multiple soft forks to take place at the same time.
The three BIPs (BIP 68, BIP 112 and BIP 113) included in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 have huge implications for the Lightning Network, which many believe to be Bitcoin's best chance for long-term scalability. Although the code for the soft fork has been deployed, miners cannot signal their support for it until May 1st.
A Huge Step Forward for the Lightning Network
The three BIPs implemented in this latest release of Bitcoin Core combine to enable relative locktime. This means that payment channels can now be closed without a predetermined date, which would be set when the channel is initially opened. This provides more flexibility to layer-2 initiatives, such as the Lightning Network, because users will be able to exit channels in a more timely manner.
Bitcoin Magazine reached out to Bitcoin Core contributor and Ciphrex CEO Eric Lombrozo for further details on how these new changes will affect the flexibility between channels on the Lightning Network, and he said:
“It depends on the locktime duration -- it's a tradeoff. Too short a time means not enough time to enforce a revocation (and steal back the funds). Too long a time and you risk waiting a while to force the channel to close if the counterparty is unresponsive.”
Lombrozo also added, “I'm not sure we've settled on an optimum value.”
According to Lombrozo, the reliability of outsourced revocation, the number of hops between channels, and other variables must also be considered. The Ciphrex CEO added, “Ideally, the locktime is never used. It's there to prevent broadcast of revoked commitments.”
In a scenario where a user wants to close a channel and the counterparty complies, Lombrozo claims the channel can essentially be closed in the next block.
Block Space More About Users Than Transactions?
One of the key points that Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon has made lately (along with co-creator Tadge Dryja) is that his generalized network for payment channels turns the block size limit into an issue of users rather than transactions. This is because bidirectional payment channels with relative locktimes can theoretically stay open forever.
While it's unclear what percentage of Bitcoin users will want to use the Lightning Network for the vast majority of their transactions, it's clear to see that this system requires block space for opening and closing channels rather than actual transactions. Although, it should be noted that a user can also send funds in a transaction that is meant to close a channel.
If everyone were using the Lightning Network, the block size limit would be a limit on the number of users who can open channels with other users. Having said that, this scenario is unlikely as there are still reasons to use the underlying Bitcoin blockchain for reasons other than opening or closing a payment channel.
Multiple Soft Forks at the Same Time
The soft fork rolled out in Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 will also not delay the deployment of Segregated Witness because Version Bits was used to implement these new features. Version Bits has implications for the pace at which scalability solutions can be added to Bitcoin, and it also enables a warning system to alert older nodes when new rules are going to be activated. The new rules become active when 95 percent of miners have upgraded to the new version of Bitcoin Core.

Congressional Republicans Battle Health Law Spending On Two Fronts — The Hill And In Court
After an initial court victory, the Republicans are advancing their arguments that the administration spent money to help defray health care costs for low-income residents without proper appropriations from Congress.
The Wall Street Journal: Affordable Care Act Battle Returns To Court And Capitol Hill
The battle between congressional Republicans and the White House over the Affordable Care Act is again escalating—in court and on Capitol Hill. The administration on Wednesday appealed a federal trial judge's ruling that the government is improperly reimbursing insurers under a program to cover discounts for low-income consumers. And House Republicans on Thursday began two days of hearings to hammer away at the issue. They released a report that said the administration distributed the funds even though it was aware it needed Congress's approval. (Armour, 7/7)
Bloomberg: Next Generation Of ACA Challenges Meeting Mixed Reception
Ever since the Supreme Court slapped away a direct challenge to the Affordable Care Act, opponents of the law have turned to collateral attacks on it's implementation by the HHS as a possible way to paralyze and eventually kill the law. Two of these attacks recently reached the federal appeals court in Washington D.C. (Loughran, 7/7)
Morning Consult: Did The White House Overstep Appropriations Law To Pay Insurers?
House Republicans on Thursday released an investigative report and held the first of two hearings questioning the legality of Obamacare's cost-sharing reduction program. That program is also the subject of a House lawsuit against the administration. ... The cost-sharing reduction program was included in the Affordable Care Act as one of two ways to relieve the cost burden for low-income enrollees on the individual market. The other method is premium tax credits for those falling between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. (Owens, 7/7)
The Hill: GOP Report Calls ObamaCare Payments Unconstitutional
An investigation by House Republicans argues that the Obama administration is illegally making certain payments under ObamaCare and that officials initially recognized they did not have authority to do so before reversing course. House Republicans argue that the administration is unconstitutionally making ObamaCare's “cost sharing reduction” payments to insurers — which help lower out-of-pocket healthcare costs for low-income ObamaCare enrollees — without a congressional appropriation. (Sullivan, 7/7)
In other health law news --
The Associated Press: Study: Trump Health Care Plan Would Make 18M Uninsured
Donald Trump's health care plan would make 18 million people uninsured, but also lower premiums significantly for policies purchased directly by consumers, according to an independent study released Thursday. The new policies would be stingier than what's sold now. Trump's plan would have little effect on people covered by employers and those on Medicare. But millions of low-income adults covered by the Medicaid expansion under President Barack Obama's health care law would lose newly gained benefits. Separately, taxpayers might save money because the government no longer would have to subsidize insurance for millions of citizens. (Alonso-Zaldivar, 7/7)
Stateline: Under Affordable Care Act, Growing Use Of ‘Community Health Workers'
Thanks in part to federal grants awarded under the Affordable Care Act, the number of community health workers is growing. In 2015, there were 48,000 of them working in the U.S., up from 38,000 three years earlier, a 27 percent increase, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. But many insurers still don't cover their services, limiting their potential impact. (Ollove, 7/8)
The CT Mirror: Access Health CT Faces Growing Challenges As Insurers Drop Out
In the wake of a state order halting new enrollment in Connecticut's co-op health insurer, HealthyCT, the state's health insurance exchange faces growing challenges as it prepares to lose two of its four carriers. The exchange, Access Health CT, has been widely heralded as one of the strongest state health insurance exchanges in the country, but loss of the two insurers will limit the options available to customers in search of health insurance. Officials at the exchange remain optimistic, although they concede the next two years will be volatile. (Constable, 7/8)

When thinking about what the next big technological advancement that takes the world by storm will be, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian tends to rely on an unexpected source: his father.
Yep, that's right — not a tech expert, his peers or a guy on Wall Street. Just his good ol' pops, a 30-year veteran travel agent.
[Related: Reddit co-founder wants to reach profitablity with membership program, not ads]
During a fireside chat at Seattle's Town Hall Monday night, GeekWire's Todd Bishop asked Ohanian what he's most excited about as an investor.
Bitcoin, an emerging decentralized, digital currency gaining popularity and making mainstream news headlines lately in light of the FBI shutting down Silk Road, was the first thing that came into his mind.
“I am cautiously optimistic about it — but I am intrigued,” said Ohanian, who has put money into more than 60 startups so far after selling Reddit in 2006.
Bishop brought up the fact that a Seattle foodtruck recently began accepting Bitcoin, and Ohanian said he knows of a bar in New York City that does that same.
But he's not totally sold yet — that is, until his father starts talking about it.
“If it can get to the point where my Dad is like, ‘Hey, tell me about this Bitcoin thing, I'm really intrigued by it' — then I'll be like, ‘OK, all right,'” he said. “That'll be the moment.”
Ohanian, who also noted crowdfunding as a space he's optimistic about, was in town promoting his new book, Without Their Permission. We'll have more from his talk later today on GeekWire.
Occupy Doesn't Have a Platform — It is a Platform
The Occupy movement comes under frequent attack from the institutional Left (and, it goes without saying, from the liberal establishment) for not offering a clear list of official demands — for, in other words, not offering a platform.
But that criticism misses the point. Occupy doesn't have a single platform, in the sense of a list of demands. But it is a platform — a collaborative platform, like a wiki. Occupy isn't a unified movement with a single list of demands and an official leadership to state them. Rather, Occupy offers a toolkit and a brand name to a thousand different movements with their own agendas, their own goals, and their own demands — with only their hatred of Wall Street and the corporate state in common, and the Occupy brand as a source of strength and identity.
Although the ends are quite different, the model of organization is much like that of al Qaeda: An essentially leaderless organization, a loose network of cells, each of which adopts the al Qaeda brand or franchise for its own purposes. It's a much more effective use of resources to provide a common platform and then let a thousand flowers bloom.
A conventional, hierarchical activist institution wastes enormous resources on administrative apparatus and endless negotiations just to get everyone on the same page, before anyone can do anything.
A common platform allows any number of movements, made up of voluntary aggregations of individuals with shared goals, to build on it on a modular basis, and to act without waiting for permission from the headquarters of the One Big Movement. And whenever they do anything that seems to work well, any other node in the network can adopt that tactic as its own without asking anyone's leave.
That's why the glocal Occupy movement is throwing off innovations like a fission reaction throws off neutrons. If anything, it's done so even more since the wave of shutdowns in the U.S. divorced it from occupation as a primary tactic and scattered its seeds to the wind.
But let's go back a way. The Pentagon Papers weren't published pursuant to an official decision by a nationwide anti-war movement, and Woodward and Bernstein didn't try to found a national political movement to impeach Nixon. In both cases, the immediate actors simply published the information, and allowed anyone who would to leverage that information. They thereby created a free platform that could be developed by any number of antiwar and anti-Nixon activists for their own ends.
Fast forward to Summer 2010. Julian Assange simply published the cable dump at Wikileaks. Every single activist movement that piggybacked on that platform, starting with the uprising in Tunisia, did so on its own initiative, making — its own judgment — the best use of the free, common platform offered by Assange. So it's gone from Tunisia to Egypt, to the Arab Spring, to Madison, to the demonstrations in Britain and Spain and Greece, to Occupy Wall Street, and back out to the global Occupy movment in hundreds of cities around the world.
Now, with the Occupy movement (thanks to Bloomberg et. al) no longer wedded to occupying public squares, the wave of innovations seems to roll in on a weekly basis. First Occupy Our Homes, and now Occupy the Ports.
According to Lester MacGurdy at Oakland Occupier, Occupy Oakland has begun to deal with police evictions by retreating, waiting until the cops are gone, then going back. Police are essentially heavy infantry who move slowly and ponderously into place, and can move only as quickly as their bloated logistical train moves with them. Protestors are light infantry who can disperse and reconcentrate on short notice. “The tactical evolution that evolved relies on two military tactics that are thousands of years old — the tactical superiority of light infantry over heavy infantry, and the tactical superiority of the retreat over the advance.” You can bet this will be standard procedure for every Occupy group in America in a week's time.
The corporate state and its thugs in black uniforms and kevlar are big, impressive, and make lots of loud noise — just like a T. Rex blundering into a tar pit. The resistance is small, agile and resilient — just like a swarm of piranha. And in the end, we'll hang their bleeding heads on our battlements.
In the immortal words of Bob Marley: “The stone that the builder refused shall be the head cornerstone.”

Considering that Rigondeaux isn't exactly in high demand -- being the ultimate high-risk/low-reward fighter -- passing on fights when very few were willing while also not having any network backing isn't exactly a recipe for success.
"It saddens me to hear that Rigondeaux has been stripped of his WBO world title and on hearing that the WBA are also considering stripping him," Hyde told Michael Woods of Ring Magazine. "Rigondeaux has worked his whole career to become the best fighter in the world. He was successful in doing this, winning two belts (as well as the RING championship), but he has surrounded himself with people who have ruined his career. No promoter or manager would touch Rigo with a 10-foot pole because these people are too difficult to deal with and they put hurdle after hurdle in front of every opportunity offered to Rigo. This is a nightmare situation for one of the best fighters in the world."
Rigondeaux is indeed one of the very best fighters in the world, but hardly anyone would fault you for not knowing that since the Cuban defector has fought only fifteen times in a seven year career. It also seems pretty clear that the "people" who have ruined Rigondeaux's career, as Hyde puts it, is a thinly-veiled shot at Caribe Promotions, a small-time company who scarcely even have a website. But Hyde doesn't absolve the fighter himself from responsibility.
"Rigo has to take some of the blame for destroying his own career," he said. "He has refused many multi-million dollar opportunities I offered to him over the last couple of years. He needs to get rid of these reptiles and get fighting again because not only will he lose his world titles outside of the ring he will also be forgotten."
As a sad matter of fact, Rigondeaux, now 35 years old, could well turn out to be one of the very best fighters of this generation who might soon fade from the memories of even dedicated fans, disappearing as quickly as he arrived on the scene -- all without so much as a whimper.

For the beguiling First Editions, Second Thoughts project, PEN America asked 61 writers and 14 artists to annotate their early works for a Dec. 2 auction at Christie's New York, with proceeds going toward PEN's cause of protecting “free expression for artists worldwide.” “I can say that it was probably the most bizarre act of writing I've ever been involved in,” Paul Auster says. Other participants include Don DeLillo, Michael Chabon, Barbara Kingsolver, Anne Tyler, Salman Rushdie, Patti Smith, and Philip Roth.
In T magazine last week, seven of the authors wrote short essays about the experience of returning to their earlier work—or that was the prompt, anyway: Some demurred, instead discussing their writing process. You should read the reflections, which are fun and also amusingly representative of their creators. They will also teach you things you may not have known about famous writers.

1. No one thinks their old books have held up.
Or at least, the writers who considered the question at all went one of two routes: They either modestly highlighted perceived failures or cited changing social mores that had made their original points obsolete. George Saunders, for instance, said that ingénue George Saunders affected an “odd” style—one that seemed to sacrifice “finesse and elegance … in the name of urgency”—because ingénue Saunders thought it would make him sound less practiced and more authentic. (For me, that wide-eyed garbled tone hasn't changed much—and Saunders' recursive claim that he once naively presented himself as more naive than he really was feels like an elaborate in-joke.)
Roth, meanwhile, went back through Portnoy's Complaint—his 1969 novel about a hyper-sexed neurotic unburdening himself to his therapist—and decided that American moral lassitude circa 2014 had stripped Portnoy of his shock value. “I portrayed a man who is the repository of every unacceptable thought, a 33-year-old man possessed by dangerous sensations, nasty opinions, savage grievances, sinister feelings and, of course, one stalked by the implacable presence of lust,” he wrote. But the “news seemingly so calamitous when Portnoy first trumpeted his phallic history … has by now been detoxified.” “Alexander Portnoy, R.I.P.,” Roth finished, apparently trying to shock us with the extreme gesture of killing off his literary alter ego and with his shocking assessment that we are unshockable.
In a compressed, Lydia Davis–like paragraph, Lydia Davis also waxed somewhat apologetic about her work: “There are a few stories [in the annotated collection] that never completely satisfied me but that I felt were good enough to go out in the world as they were,” she explained. “I simply couldn't think what more I could do to them.” She said she tends to keep working on a draft until it no longer “bothers” her, which is notable because of the way her stories worry at mundane images or ideas until they make you nervous. (Some Law of the Conservation of Unease must govern this transfer of anxiety from author to reader.) Also, there's a way in which admitting you've sent out into the universe a few subtly defective stories is just another tactic for making people uncomfortable, like telling them some of the veggie burger patties they just bought might contain pork.

2. Ask writers to meditate on their past writerly personas, and you will mostly get further demonstrations of ongoing writerly personas.
Not only do we have Saunders being charming/unassuming, Roth being incendiary, and Davis being unsettling, but there is Robert Caro marshaling a kind of understated grandeur (“The change in rhythm in the last line, that's a dying fall”), Marilynne Robinson blending graciousness and lyricism, and Junot Diaz starting off with prophetic-sounding, epiphanic statements (“The beginning only revealed itself at the end”) that you hope he'll color in later. Do writers actually take these assignments seriously as exercises in mask-lowering? Or are they consciously retreating further into the disguise?

3. When you ask famous writers to look at their old books, they start comparing them to ancient poetry (either that or T Magazine primed contributors with an image of the Iliad).
Fun fact: Three out of seven authors independently reference epic poetry. “What's the first word” of the Iliad, asks Roth. “Rage. That is how the whole of European literature begins: singing the virile rage of Achilles.” Caro describes resorting to the Homeric catalogue in his bid to capture Robert Moses' titanic achievements in highway construction. “Homer lists all the kingdoms that are coming to sack Troy and all the heroes of Troy who are going to fight them. These lists have a great rhythm to them. I thought that, if I could write well enough, I could do the same thing with highways.” Jennifer Egan laments that A Visit From the Goon Squad didn't contain a chapter written in Homeric style: “I still regret that I couldn't find a way to include epic poetry and PowerPoint in a single book.” Maybe the task of revisiting their older work got these writers thinking about the origins of literature itself. “We come back to what we've made and find out it's been changing all along,” Saunders reflected in his piece. That's obvious for poetry in the oral tradition and less obvious for contemporary fiction—but probably true for both.
"I will be bound by what the experts say because I am not in a position to second guess them with my expertise," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Dec. 17.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's recent decision to ban fracking shines a spotlight on the balancing act governments in potentially oil- and gas-rich regions face weighing economic benefits against environmental concerns.
The Democratic governor, who is set to begin his second term on Jan. 1, said in his Dec. 17 announcement that his decision was based on the New York State Department of Health's conclusion that fracking for natural gas cannot be done safely.
Former Gov. David Patterson first imposed a moratorium on gas drilling by high volume hydraulic fracturing in 2008 to allow a review of fracking's impact. Cuomo's move comes after he weighed the potential economic benefits drilling could bring to Upstate regions sitting atop the Marcellus Shale rock formation, along with protests from environmentalists concerned that fracking could damage water supplies.
"All things being equal, I will be bound by what the experts say because I am not in a position to second guess them with my expertise," said Cuomo during a Dec. 17 cabinet meeting where the state announced the decision to not proceed with fracking. "It is a highly technical field that needs more information and less emotion."
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Joe Martens said in a statement that with an increasing number of localities that have enacted fracking bans and moratoriums, "the risks substantially outweigh any potential economic benefits."
While many Democratic leaders praised Cuomo's decision, New York State Republican Chairman Ed Cox issued a statement saying this was missed opportunity to capitalize on the recent popularity of fracking across the country. Cox argued that fracking is supported by President Obama and U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
"Andrew Cuomo has given into the radical environmental Luddites in his own party to leave New York as the only one of 35 states with extractable natural gas to be missing out on the hydro-boom," said Cox. "While unemployment in New York's shale-rich Southern Tier remains high, safety regulated natural gas development has led to the creation of a quarter of a million new jobs across the border in Pennsylvania."
The ban won't factor in New York's credit rating, said Standard & Poor's Senior Director David Hitchcock, its lead analyst for New York State.
"We don't see the ban on fracking as having a significant credit impact for New York State," said Hitchcock. "It does not currently receive revenue from fracking, although it could close off potential future revenue growth from this source."
He added however that revenue derived from fracking is "significant" in other states like North Dakota and Texas.
The conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute for Policy Research estimated in a 2011 report that a lifting of New York's fracking ban would generate $11.4 billion for state and local governments over a nine-year period.
"It would clearly make a difference for local governments both for the tax base and employment opportunities," said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Labor. "It's very sad that they are not going to benefit from this opportunity."
The Marcellus Shale is also situated underneath two-thirds of Pennsylvania and portions of Ohio and West Virginia. A report last year from Janney Capital Markets said jobs related to the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania peaked in early 2012 after receiving a temporary boost from increased gas drilling in 2010.
Pennsylvania lawmakers considered last year implementing a new severance tax for natural-gas production that would be paid by drillers based on the value of gas taken from a well.
Republican Gov. Tom Corbett objected to the idea, which was floated to help plug a $1.5 billion budget gap, but the proposal could get new life when Democrat Tom Wolf takes over Jan. 20.
Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's both downgraded Pennsylvania in September, but added that the state could benefit from continued development of Marcellus Shale natural gas deposits.
"Modifying or expanding revenues related to natural gas drilling could provide additional revenues but such changes are not the end all be all solution for Pennsylvania's budget stresses," said Janney Capital Markets director Tom Kozlik. "They can help but will not fill the budget gap for next year or future years alone."
New York's action to ban fracking contrasts with California, where Gov. Jerry Brown has declined to stand in the way of the process and legislation that would have banned it failed to advance in the legislature in 2014.
The state-affiliated California Council on Science and Technology released a report in August concluding there is little environmental risk to fracking, and the federal Bureau of Land Management announced in late August that it will sell leases again for oil and gas extraction.
Though the move is expected to increase fracking in the massive Monterey Shale formation, a Aug. 28 Moody's report said the financial impact on state and local governments will be minimal since California is the only oil-producing state without a full-fledged severance tax in place.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the states that collected the most severance taxes from mineral resource drilling in 2013 were Texas, with $4.6 billion, Alaska at $4 billion, North Dakota with $2.5 billion, Wyoming at $868 million and Louisiana with $834 million.
Fifteen states had no severance tax while some like California only imposed a statewide assessment fee, which led to just $38 million being collected.
Shale natural gas production was estimated to have generated $18.6 billion in federal, state and local government taxes in 2010, according to IHS Global Insights.
"It expands the range of budget choices," said Jim Diffley, chief economist and senior director at IHS Global Insights, on the fiscal benefits fracking can deliver, "It gives them more flexibility with their budgets."
Marcy Block, senior director at Fitch Ratings, says severance taxes on gas drilling for certain states can be a help revenue wise, but for New York as is the case in many other states, it would have comprised a small component of state revenue.
Gas-drilling states where the severance tax helps aid the overall operating budgets include Wyoming, New Mexico and West Virginia, Block said. However, some states benefit in other ways economically such as Oklahoma, where about one out of every three jobs derive from the oil and natural gas industry.
"For some states severance taxes are very important," said Block. "For some states natural resources has been a part of the economy for a very long time."
British poster artist Olly Moss shows his nerdy love for the original Star Wars trilogy in a trio of new posters he created for collectible art house Mondo. The prints, revealed exclusively by Wired.com in the first three frames of this gallery, go on sale at a random time Monday. They are the first in Mondo's wildly popular Star Wars series to be crafted as traditional, theatrical one-sheet movie posters. The new posters show colorful silhouettes of C-3PO, Darth Vader and Boba Fett that are filled in with detailed imagery from Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. To create original artwork for such rabidly adored films was daunting, Moss said, especially since so many of the visuals are already iconic. "It was so intimidating!" the artist told Wired.com in an e-mail interview. "There is such a wealth of great Star Wars art out there already, from paid professionals and from enthusiastic fans. I suppose my main aim was to make a set of Star Wars posters that were a little different from what people are used to seeing from the franchise, but still retained that essential Star Wars feel. I started by re-watching the original movies with a sketchbook on my lap, and just sort of went from there." Still, there was no backing away from the challenge. "If you're as big a nerd as I am, you just can't say no to Star Wars," Moss said. Moss has worked with Mondo and its parent company, Austin, Texas–based Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, frequently. He created the Alamo's 2010 Rolling Roadshow posters as well as Mondo's The Trouble With Tribbles poster. Justin Ishmael, Mondo's creative director, said Moss often nails his poster concepts on his first attempt. "Olly does sketches and will e-mail them to us and ... a lot of the times, they are exactly what the finals look like!" Ishmael said in an e-mail. "It's almost like seeing the inner workings of a genius' brain in real time." Given Moss' talent, he was a coveted artist for Mondo's Star Wars series, a high-stakes project for the art house. George Lucas is notoriously protective of his Star Wars images, and it took Ishmael and Mondo a year to woo Lucasfilm into licensing the characters and worlds that would grace the posters. Instead of flowers, Mondo sent over poster prototypes made with metallic and glow-in-the-dark ink. All that work paid off. Mondo has released 17 posters — and counting — in its Star Wars series, including a blueprint of R2-D2 and a series of six bounty hunters. Many of the prints sold out within minutes. Beyond the retail success, the featured artists and Ishmael have a personal stake in Star Wars. "We're fans first," Ishmael said. "I couldn't think of a reason to choose something, if it wasn't because we liked it. I guess we could get licenses for Twilight because it's hot. We'd make a lot of money, but Twilight is lame, and we only do stuff that we personally like."* Moss, when asked about his most beloved Star Wars character and film, responded: "Obi-Wan and Empire Strikes Back. Duh." The Force is strong with this one. Follow @MondoNews on Twitter on Monday if you want to score one of the new Star Wars posters by Moss, which measure 24 inches by 36 inches (the first time Moss has done that size). The posters cost $50 each. If you miss your chance, well, that sucks, but two more posters in the series will be released by the end of 2010.

For this print, I made certain that I stayed true to the original trilogy and spent months watching and pausing it. Although this print is largely technical, I was hoping that by showing R2-D2's individual tools and components all spread out, people can reflect on the moments in the trilogy where he used those devices to save the day and the galaxy."
scrapyard Power Droid Artist: Jeff Soto Size: 24 inches x 36 inches Limited edition of: 350 (hand-numbered) On sale: June 25 (sold out in one hour) Artist statement: "Star Wars was a pretty big deal for me as a kid. I was only 2 when the movie came out, and I can't even remember if I saw it or not in the theater. The characters and story were known to many of us mainly from the toys! The toys! Oh they were wonderful, and we played with them for hours — and wore out the Best and Sears catalog! One of my favorite action figures was the power droid, and I didn't really know much about the little guy, but for some reason he (I pictured it being male for some reason) captivated my imagination. I realized at some time that he's barely even in the movie, which added to his mystique. Over the years he functioned as the worn-out, floppy-legged power supply for numerous Transformers, G.I. Joes and Construx. He is small and cute, and found a place in my childhood heart. I still have the little guy. This piece is an ode to the power droid!"
Salacious B. Crumb Artist: Rhys Cooper Limited edition of: 325 Size: 24 inches x 36 inches On sale: Sept. 30 (sold out in 10 minutes) Artist statement: "I always thought Salacious Crumb is the kind of character that makes Star Wars great. Little personalities like his are what give the galaxy far, far away its depth and diversity."
Raider Artist: Dave Kinsey Size: 24 inches x 36 inches Limited edition of: 350 (hand-numbered) On sale: July 8 (sold out in 25 minutes) Artist statement: "The Tusken raiders, like Gonk, have really stayed with us at Mondo over the years; easily one of the most unique characters of the original trilogy. Even with very little screen time, the look, mannerisms (riding single file to conceal their numbers) and even the sounds that the sand people made are classic. We are proud to make this our second offering in the series." —Justin Ishmael, Mondo's creative director
Luke's Destiny Artist: Frank Stockton Limited edition of: 360 Size: 24 inches x 36 inches On sale: Oct. 28 (sold out in 10 minutes) Artist statement: "I chose to illustrate what is, to me, the most poignant moment of all the films. Luke, who was broken down, battered, and disfigured by Vader, was offered the chance to save himself by compromising his ideals and betraying his friends. With seemingly no chance of survival, he makes the decision to leap into the dangerous and uncertain unknown. This is the moment of him making that choice."
Hoth Artist: Dan McCarthy Size: 12 inches x 36 inches Limited edition of: 475 (hand-numbered) On sale: Aug. 20 (sold out in 12 minutes) Artist statement: "Dan McCarthy is well-known for prints that depict vast landscapes, but more importantly, he's great at conveying mood. For this reason, we thought he'd be perfect for the scene on Hoth in Empire Strikes Back where the probe droids infiltrate the Rebel defenses and alert the Empire to their whereabouts. Notice the streaks in the sky as they enter the atmosphere ... this is literally the calm before the storm." —Justin Ishmael, Mondo's creative director
Great Warrior Artist: Todd Slater Size: 17 inches x 24 inches Limited edition of: 385 On sale: Aug. 26 (sold out in five minutes) Artist statement: "From the first time that I saw Star Wars, I was captivated by the mystery of Yoda's species and home world. For Yoda, Dagobah was a place to disappear, and I see him as being at one with the landscape. For this print I wanted to camouflage him as a part of this murky planet using leaves, sticks, ferns and other flora found in the swamps. The image is printed on black paper with a shiny black varnish layer in the background. The varnished layer reveals even more of Dagobah and is shown as a transparency through Yoda's face. The kanji (japanese characters) on the left side gives one-word representations of the six stages I identified in Luke's Jedi training: the meeting of a great warrior, the discovery of a Jedi's strength, entering of a domain of evil, learning that size matters not, seeing the future and finally, the confrontation of Vader. The screen print is seven colors, which is the most I've done to date."
Father: Encounter on Dagobah Artist: Tomer Hanuka Size: 19 inches x 25 inches Limited edition of: 350 (hand-numbered) On sale: July 29 (sold out in 30 minutes) Artist statement: "The central idea going into this image was depicting planet Dagobah itself as a portrait of Luke's subconscious in its most interesting and unformed phase. In a nightmarish sequence, Luke runs into the mist where he thinks he saw Vader. Luke finds him and a lightsaber duel ends with Vader's decapitation. The mask cracks open on the severed head, exposing the frozen face of a dead Luke Skywalker. The suggestion here is that somewhere within Luke's psyche there is a potential for ultimate evil. Luke's greatest challenge isn't the Galactic Empire and its endless, faceless troopers, but the magnetism of the dark side; the seductive idea of choosing his own potential for power over everything else."
Attack Position Artist: Rich Kelly Size: 24 inches x 36 inches Limited edition of: 400 Price: $50 On sale: Nov. 12 (sold out in less than two hours) Artist statement: "When I was approached with this project, a considerable amount of artistic liberty was encouraged. After re-watching the original trilogy and observing how Chewbacca interacted with the rest of the characters, I realized that on more than one occasion he was basically used for comic relief with Han. Even during some of the battle scenes he seems to be fumbling around a bit. As a kid, I definitely remember thinking of him as a major force to be reckoned with. Therefore, I decided I wanted to depict Chewie as one bad dude; kicking ass and taking names. Endor came to mind as an appropriate environment, with Chewbacca gliding down a fallen tree, about to attack a couple of unsuspecting stormtroopers."
A Wretched Hive Artist: Martin Ansin Limited edition of: Regular (copper color) 360 Size: 24 inches x 36 inches On sale: Nov. 18 (sold out in 10 minutes) Artist statement: "I've always liked that scene in Reign of Fire where these post-apocalyptic survivors re-enact Star Wars scenes for their children; in the future, the stories that we really like to have become legends. For this poster I tried to do something similar, but in the opposite direction in time. I wanted to see how the cantina scene would look if it had been illustrated for an old book, if Star Wars was a traditional epic adventure sharing space with King Arthur and Beowulf. Who knows, maybe sometime in the future it will."

Aug 15 (Reuters) - Virginia will give its public employees a 3 percent bonus on Dec. 1 after the state ended fiscal 2012 with a $448.5 billion surplus, Governor Bob McDonnell told state legislators on Wed nesday.
It was the third year in a row the state has posted a surplus of more than $400 million, although it was nearly 18 percent lower than the $544.8 million surplus in fiscal 2011.
The surplus-linked bonus for workers was in the fiscal 2012 budget but was not in the previous two spending plans.
Fiscal 2012 ended on June 30 and last month the state said its revenues had grown 5.4 percent from the previous year and returned to the high level reached in fiscal 2008.
The state budget had stipulated that if agencies found savings and did not spend their entire appropriations they could share the wealth of a surplus with employees who had maintained high performance ratings.
“Revenues are up due to economic growth, not tax increases,” McDonnell told the state's senate finance, house appropriations and house finance committees.
Because of its proximity to the nation's capital, Virginia weathered the 2007-09 recession better than many other states.
It also found savings in a continued hiring freeze and in reorganization, McDonnell said.
The surplus will go into the state's rainy day fund, higher education and a reserve to help mitigate possible federal budget cuts. A budget deal passed by the U.S. Congress last year resulted in a process known as “sequestration,” which will bring about automatic spending cuts both on domestic programs that filter through states and on the defense industry that has a large presence in Virginia.
About $77.2 million will go toward the bonuses.
“After five years without a pay raise, I am pleased that we are able to reward our employees with a performance bonus, while simultaneously preserving core services and building up the Commonwealth's cash reserves,” McDonnell said.
– Luxury villa for sale for 15,000 Bitcoins
– ‘There are hundreds of Bitcoin millionaires out there, and it's burning a hole in their pocket'
Fancy views of the beautiful Mediterranean coastline with the prime minister as your next door neighbour? Then maybe it's time to move to Caesarea for a slice of your very own paradise.
The property owner is offering his luxury villa for sale at nearly $3 million, but wants the buyer to pay in Bitcoin.
The villa is located on the Mediterranean coast, in a quiet cul-de-sac in the exclusive Caesarea area, and boasts seven large bedrooms, five bathrooms and a safe room, not to forget the outdoor heated pool shaded by tropical palm trees.
The luxury property was listed on BitPremier last week, a high-end website for ‘astute buyers in the Bitcoin community', where shoppers can find everything from super yachts to vintage cars and private islands, all purchasable with the cryptocurrency.
Potential buyers will be surrounded by the wealthy elite, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Valery Kogan, who has a cool net worth of nearly $2 billion and is a close friend of Vladimir Putin.
Appearing on Israeli prime-time television,the property's owner, Eli, said,
‘I want to make history by selling my property for Bitcoin. Whether the price goes up or down, I'm prepared to take the risk.
‘There are hundreds of Bitcoin early adopters who became multimillionaires literally overnight, and it's burning a hole in their pocket.
‘The location is not the normal place for a holiday home for anyone from outside Israel, but the Caesarea coastline is a hidden gem.'
Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central control. The currency's cryptographic features make it attractive to the tech savvy, and enable anyone to shop online without fear of censors or government regulation.
The cryptocurrency was trading at £218 on the exchange yesterday, and recently, companies like Dell, Virgin Galactic, Expedia and PayPal have offered customers the choice to pay with the digital currency.
The property is for sale here: https://www.bitpremier.com/5-real-estate/178-beautiful-7br-luxury-villa-caesarea-israel
Looking for the next best number puzzle game? Then you have to check out Shut the Box found on the Nintendo eShop for the WiiU.
Developed by RCMADIAX, Shut The Box is a basic game of chance and luck.
Simple Rules
You must roll the dice and select the number of tiles that correspond with what you have just rolled. You may choose to select one or more tiles in order to gain the desired number. The goal of the game is to eliminate all the tiles and score a perfect game.
Get the Game Started
When the game starts up you are provided with 3 rows of tiles numbering 1-9. And a block that holds the dice. When you are ready simply hit TOSS DICE to be presented with 2 dice. Now the fun begins trying to remove the tiles. The trick I found is to be careful to not go remove happy and start removing all the lower tiles first by combining them to make higher numbers. The risk there is while you are removing more tiles you are eliminating the lower numbers and may not have any available tiles if the dice number rolled is 2 or 3. Risky Risky.
Controlling
The controls are extremely basic and is just a simple touch-based interface. No button pushing needed. And winning is all by chance. There is no secret formula to getting a high score, It is a great balance of skill and luck that keeps you addicted and wanting to get a higher score. You will see quickly that while the can learn how to play the game very quickly, it is going to take you much longer to become truly good at it.
As a parent of 3 young kids who all have their fair share of gaming in their blood already I can't wait until they are old enough to understand the match and skill behind the game. I can seriously see me including this game in their math homework one day. No no you aren't doing math you are playing a video game … no GO!!
Where's the Box?
Now that all that is said one question still remains .. what's up with the name, Shut the Box. So far I have seen no box, and no clue as to how or why it is to be shut. My theory is once I can clear the board with a perfect 135 score magically a box will appear over my WiiU and shut it, never to be played again. Oh wait NO! that would be bad.
Alright then, so what is our verdict today for you. Based on the Confident Gamer's rating system we think that you should GRAB IT now. So head over to the Nintendo eShop today and spend the 99¢ download it now and give it a try today and see how high you can score! Let us know below just how high you get. Would love to know when one of our readers score a perfect score.
A copy of the game was provided to us via @IndieGamerChick on Twitter as a part of the #GamesMatter campaign where codes are given for Indie games. Why? It's great marketing for the developers. For most indies, the only chance they have to catch on is through word of mouth. #GamesMatter gives developers a more organized, targeted resource to create word of mouth. Every person who talks about the game they get is potentially marketing it to every single person that sees them talking about it.

Once again, the vote is going to sway leading more toward whether you are for or against same-sex marriage. That should never be any of the reasons to vote. We all know that not everyone agrees that same-sex couples should have the right to marry, but one man should not have the right to deny anyone the right to marry. Marriage is a religious union, not a political one. What people do behind closed doors should not be the main concern of the US, but thanks to Religion in Politics it has been the biggest controversy this election. Abortion has also been one of the big issues, due to Paul Ryan not understanding how a woman can see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or their faith. When did the choices that a woman decided to make about her own body become the business of the rest of the world? If a female feels the need to have an abortion, they should have the right to do so. Legal or not, a female desperate enough is going to have one either way. If it is made illegal, there will either be a higher rate of infant homicide or deaths caused by improper abortion.It all comes down to the Bill of Rights, in which the first amendment discusses the wall of separation between church and state. If Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; Congress should also make no law prohibiting human and civil rights based on any religious bias. Lest we not forget that some of the members who push the topic of religion are often not so holy behind closed doors themselves. How many who have deemed that same-sex marriage will diminish the sanctity have broken the religious morale regarding their own marriages? Adultery and divorce diminished the sanctity of marriage far before same-sex marriage was even an issue. So why is it that only some religious views are present on the platform? Why not all? Because not all religious points are quite as convenient as others.Religion will be a factor in my voting choice when there is a vote to appoint a new preacher, priest, reverend, etc. in a church. However, it should never be a factor in voting for the leadership of a country as a whole. Mainly because no two religions are the same. Who's to say that every other religious group is going to agree with the way the country will be run? What are they supposed to do? Move if they don't like it? It's ironic to think that if that is the case they will have to leave a country that was founded on the basis of religious tolerance to begin with. Food for thought.

Background: The Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform¶
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is perhaps the most important and fundamental of modern numerical algorithms. It provides a fast, $O[N\log N]$ method of computing the discrete Fourier transform: $$ Y_k^\pm = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} y_n e^{\pm i k n / N} $$ You can read more about the FFT in my previous post on the subject.
One important limitation of the FFT is that it requires that input data be evenly-spaced: that is, we can think of the values $y_n$ as samples of a function $y_n = y(x_n)$ where $x_n = x_0 + n\Delta x$ is a regular grid of points. But what about when your grid is not uniform? That is, what if you want to compute this result: $$ Y_k^\pm = \sum_{j=1}^N y(x_j) e^{\pm i k x_j} $$ where $y(x)$ is evaluated at an arbitrary set of points $x_j$? In this case, the FFT is no longer directly applicable, and you're stuck using a much slower $O[N^2]$ direct summation.
Stuck, that is, until the NUFFT came along.
The NUFFT is an algorithm which converts the non-uniform transform into an approximate uniform transform, not with error-prone interpolation, but instead using a clever "gridding" operation motivated by the convolution theorem. If you'd like to read about the algorithm in detail, the Courant Institute's NUFFT page has a nice set of resources.
Below we'll take a look at implementing this algorithm in Python.
The past year has seen a significant rise in religious coercion and violence on a religious background in Israel, a US State Department report on religious freedom issued on Wednesday stated. The report surveys religious freedom parameters in some 200 countries around the world and devotes a 29-page chapter to Israel.
Battle on Education Religious slam supervision of education content Kobi Nahshoni Ultra-orthodox leaders call supervision of educational content 'existential threat' Religious slam supervision of education content
The report states that "approximately 360,000 citizens who immigrated from the former-Soviet Union under the Law of Return but are not considered Jewish by the Orthodox Rabbinate, cannot be buried in Jewish cemeteries, divorce, or marry within the country."
It also noted that most of the Jews in Israel are not religious-Orthodox and oppose the Orthodox establishment's control of crucial aspects of their lives.
The report also mentiones the High Rabbinical Court's 2009 ruling which cast a doubt on 40,000 conversions performed by the state.
According to the report, there has been a significant rise in hostility manifestations between secular Jews and religious Jews in the past year and pointed to violent haredi demonstrations involving vandalism and violence towards police officers.
Inter-religious conflicts are also mentioned: "There were reports on haredi Jews insulting and spitting at priests and nuns, and defacing with graffiti and throwing garbage and dead cats at monasteries in Jerusalem."
In the field of religious coercion, the report pointed to the separation between men and women in services in the Western Wall and the operation of the ultra-Orthodox chastity squads.
Segregated bus lines
The State Department also reported that the "public transportation company, Egged, continued to operate some sex-segregated buses along inter-and intra-city routes frequented by ultra-Orthodox Jews" and noted that "women who refused to sit at the back of such buses risked harassment and physical assault by male passengers."
The report states that "ultra-Orthodox groups that proselytize secular Jews, encouraging them to adopt ultra-Orthodox practices and beliefs, enjoyed government funding." On the other hand, it was also noted that the Supreme Court continued to issue rulings based on freedom of religion and equality. The report also addressed the growing tension between the Orthodox establishment and the secular courts, particularly in relation to the Emmanuel affair
Chairman of the Hiddush foundation For Freedom of Religion and Equality, Rabbi Uri Regev said in response: "It appears that when it comes to religious freedom Israel is closer to radical Islam countries than the Western democratic world.
"The report discusses at length the Israeli government's capitulation to the haredi parties' extortion and the way in which it compromises marriage rights, freedom of worship, women's dignity, the immigrant population, the non-Jewish communities and many others as part of a policy which gains power by funding religious institutes and capitulting to religious coercion while disregarding the will of the majority of the Jewish people in Israel and in the Diaspora. "
Four years ago, Paris made headlines for its bus stop of the future, a bigger and better bus stop with amenities like bikesharing and a book-sharing library attached. Now College Park has a bus stop with some of the same amenities, but using inexpensive, off-the-shelf pieces.

Paris' bus stop of the future
In 2012, Paris's transit agency tried out a luxurious new bus stop design. In addition to the normal sign, bench, and shelter, the stop had electric bikes, bookshelves, wifi, and stylish architecture. It looked great and it made waiting for the bus more enjoyable, but it was expensive and took up a lot of space.
Paris' concept was a neat idea, but wasn't ultimately practical for mass production.

But some of the ideas from Paris's attempt make sense. Locating a bikeshare station next to a bus stop makes it convenient for more people to use both. And book-sharing can be a nice amenity, if it's easy and inexpensive to manage.
College Park's version
Enter College Park, where rather than design a custom building, the city simply added some of those components to an existing bus stop using their standard off-the-shelf pieces.
They started with a normal bus stop sign and shelter, then added a standard mBike bikeshare station. To help with maintenance, the city chained a bike tire pump to the station sign.
For the library, they staked to the ground a Little Free Library, a pre-fab wood box for people to take and give away free books. There's no librarian and no library cards; it runs on the honor system, and relies on people donating as many books as they take.

The stop is at the corner of Rhode Island Avenue and Muskogee Street, in front of the Hollywood shopping center, just one block south of College Park's first protected bikeway. The stop serves Metrobus lines 81 and 83, which are among the busier lines in Prince George's County.
It's no grand Parisian bus station, but that would be overkill. For a bus stop in a relatively low-density suburban area, it's pretty darn nice.

Leslie Banks and Constance Cummings reading the script for the 1938 TV adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac (c) BBC
*A quick update from our Reading Team*
Dear Writers who Submitted to BBC Writersroom Drama Scriptroom 12
We are just coming to the end of our first sift (first 10 pages) and we thought you might like to know that the standard of entry this year is insanely high. Consequently, the decision making process is a bit of a headache. So we just wanted to say thank you; reading lots of quality scripts is a luxury problem we haven't experienced quite like this.
It's been fantastic to receive almost 4000 scripts (3796 exactly) which capture such a vast array of voices, ideas and worlds.
You've talked about Brexit, explored dystopian futures, been drawn to Glaswegians, terrorists and time travelling. You've experimented with biopics, thrillers, period dramas, whodunnits, who's doing its (relationship dramas) and more besides. You've featured a cast of thousands, plenty, to two-handers, to monologues. You've shaken up middle England, dumped us in Uganda, and dropped metaphorical bombs in Dublin, Ohio and beyond. You've sent us movies, stage plays, radio dramas, dramedies and TV content of various durations.
In short, there is a genuine sense that each script could reveal that bit of unquantifiable magic that we'll lazily describe as a ‘must read page turner'.
So this is just a thank-you. Whatever you're drinking, keep drinking it, it's doing the trick.
More updates to follow in a week or so.
The Reading Team
NB All writers will receive a response at the end of the process (May TBC) but if your writing is anything to go by, the shortlisting could be a total nightmare and we could be deliberating for some time...

The Wisconsin capitol police chief and his top deputy responsible for carrying out Gov. Scott Walker's unconstitutional arrests of protesters both got double digit pay raises from the governor.
The Journal Sentinel reported:
Gov. Scott Walker's administration rewarded the new hardline Capitol Police chief and his top deputy with double-digit pay raises earlier this year after moving the pair on paper to phantom jobs for two weeks and then back to their real posts. Chief Dave Erwin — who has overseen a crackdown on Walker protesters at the statehouse — received an overall salary hike of 11.7%, to $111,067 a year, the same rate as his predecessor. That amounts to an $11,680 annual raise. That hefty raise was possible only because Walker officials transferred Erwin on Feb. 5 to a ghostposition in the state Department of Administration, according to a copy of the transfer letter obtained by the Journal Sentinel. Then, on the same day, he was shuffled back to his real job as head of the Capitol Police force. Each of the moves, backdated to earlier in the fiscal year, came with a retroactive boost in pay for Erwin. Under state rules, the chief is a civil servant, not a political appointee.
This is confirmation of what has been long suspected. The Capitol Police are being used as Gov. Walker's private militia in his battle against free speech, the constitution, and protesters. In total more than 200 people have now been arrested at the capitol for singing. Walker has ordered his police to show no mercy. The protesters that have been arrested have ranged in age from 14-80+. Remember, these people were arrested for singing in the capitol. They were exercising their constitutionally protected rights.
At least one police officer in the state has gone on record expressing his anger and disappointment with how his colleagues have acted. The officer was puzzled as to why the Capitol Police would waste time arresting 80 year old protesters when they could be out dealing with real crime.
I think we have our answer now. The situation in Wisconsin is much more corrupt than most people outside of the state could have possibility imagined. Scott Walker is firmly in control of the leadership of the Capitol Police force.
Constitutional rights are being obliterated in the state on a daily basis, so that Gov. Walker can silence his critics and further his delusional presidential ambitions head of 2016.

The week's restaurant review: Bar Basque, which Jeffrey Chodorow opened a few months ago on the second floor of the new Eventi Hotel on Sixth Avenue.
Once when I climbed the staircase there, I interrupted an overweight couple in late middle age making out on the landing as if auditioning for parts on “Skins.” Another time, somewhere in the restaurant, I got lost looking for the restroom and thought I was being auditioned for a role in “Lost in Translation II — Not Everyone Can Be Found.”
It's a space-agey dystopia all the way through Bar Basque, all red and black and shiny and not really comfortable at all.
The food is great, though. That's the thing. For the most part it's cosmopolitan and delicious, Basque food for the brilliant. If it were served in a chic little candlelighted dining room filled with wood and linen, people would be going haywire about this place.
Instead you dine alongside Stefon, who is drinking vodka and not really interested in eating at all.
This is kind of a drag.
Today's discussion might be restaurants whose food does not match the décor; or restaurants where the décor does not match the food. (Pizza at the Mark by Jean-Georges Vongerichten goes in both directions!) And if you'd like to take part in that, have at the comments below.
But really? I think back to that couple on the stairs, and to a couple of two-women, one-man tables I saw over the months in the dining room, and to the behavior of some canoodlers in the bar and to some 15 years now of experiencing Mr. Chodorow's immensely profitable and often quite enjoyable brand of sticky-hot-sweet food and patrons at Asia de Cubas and China Grills and elsewhere, and here's what I want to know:
What's the most insane or interesting or notable or amazing thing you've ever seen in a restaurant owned by Jeffrey Chodorow?
He has restaurants in New York, London, Mexico City, Las Vegas, Fort Lauderdale, Atlantic City and Chicago. Share your experiences in them below.
Rep. Matt Schaefer (R-Tyler) put forward an amendment that would make it illegal to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks, even if a fetus “has a severe and irreversible abnormality,” effectively forcing families with wanted, but unsustainable pregnancies to carry to term at the behest of the state and against the advice of their doctors or their own wishes.
Schaefer said that suffering is “part of the human condition, since sin entered the world.”
Last week in Texas, a Republican lawmaker proposed an amendment so outrageous, that even some of his own GOP colleagues were repulsed. Andrea Grimes, with RH Reality, reports:What would cause a lawmaker to want the government to inflict more emotional pain onto an already grieving family, in addition to adding a major health risk to the mother? Does he not realize a woman can easily die of sepsis by carrying a deceased or nonviable fetus?Oh, for fucksake! Where do these people come from? More importantly, how do they hide their vile and odious ignorance long enough to get elected?
Democratic Representative, Jessica Farrar of Houston, is quoted as saying this is the most misogynistic piece of legislation she's seen during her 21 years in office. Matt Schaefer's amendment actually passed, but he removed it for full committee review after Trey Martinez Fischer, the House Democrat from San Antonio filed a legislative point of order.
The late author, humorist and commentator, Molly Ivins, sums up late-term abortion, perfectly, in an excellent video. Here is an excerpt.
"I almost get the impression that somebody thinks women have no moral sense at all. No woman who is seven months pregnant, ever waddles past an abortion clinic and says, 'Darn, I knew there was something I've been meaning to get around to.'
This is ridiculous. You have those late-term abortions, because either the mother is going to die, the child is going to die, or both are going to die."
There seems to be a nonstop effort by Republican lawmakers to control women/their bodies - often in the name of God. Thankfully, there is also a nonstop effort by a much larger voice in this country - the people who refuse to let women go back to illegal, back alley, abortion butchery. This battle will most likely not end in our lifetimes, or in our children's lifetimes. But we will stay unified, and we will never give up.
Here are some of the pro-choice organizations and social media groups to visit/support:
You can share your thoughts with this GOP extremist on his Facebook page, where he is seen buddying up with other anti-choice misogynists like former Republican Governor Rick Perry and Republican Senator Ted Cruz.
Special thanks to Anne Burks.
Note: After careful thought and asking friends I respect (including kossack jplanner), I am removing the word 'deceased' from the title and using 'nonviable.' (If you share the story on Facebook, the change may not appear, given the amount of FB 'likes' the story has garnered.) I still believe, that Matt Schaefer's amendment can be construed to apply to deceased fetuses, as it does not clarify or exclude the term, and the exclusion could be used against women. I also believe a 'braindead' fetus (considered 'nonviable') is a deceased fetus,' regardless of a heartbeat. So the title change is a compromise. Insulting comments, to the point of being slanderous/libelous are uncalled in our community, and it was a shame to see them made by several folks. Thankfully, it is not common, as kindness and civility prevail here at Daily Kos. Thank you for the incredible support, and apologies for any misunderstandings.
As it is the season of goodwill, Maggoty Lamb devotes his – or her – the latest dispatch from the front line of music journalism to handing out some end-of-year awards, and is pretty nice to everyone, except perhaps the Guardian
As if the opportunity to disagree with music journalists' year-end top 10s on an individual basis was not evidence enough of a new post-Leveson era of media accountability, did you know that the deliberations of the Uncut music award judging panel are now available online? This is certainly exciting news for anyone liable to be horribly gripped by the spectacle of Stewart Lee succumbing (perhaps not for the first time) to his inner indie snob while Linda Thompson bravely tries to talk some sense into him re Bill Callahan's Apocalypse. OK, perhaps that's just me then.
In the planning stages of our own inaugural rival ceremony, there was excited talk of assembling the ultimate reality TV talent jury to compete with Uncut's all-star line up (Tony Wadsworth, Mark Cooper … with these industry heavyweights you are spoiling us), incorporating breakout X Factor mentor Tulisa, America's Next Top Model and American Vogue's Andre Leon Talley, Michel Roux Jr's gimlet-eyed consigliere Monica Galleti, and Strictly's Bruno Tonioli. Sadly the budget just wasn't there, but rest assured all decisions have been made in hopes of approximating the ones Andre, Tulisa, Monica and Bruno might have come to, and the number of categories has been kept down to five so as not to be endlessly boring like the Grammys.
1. Best Fall interview
Robert Chalmers's superb extended encounter with Mark E Smith in the Independent on Sunday wins this one hands down – not only for 2011 but perhaps in perpetuity. What our celebrity judges would have loved the most about this piece was the way Chalmers captures the overlap between four closely related but not entirely identical Mark E Smiths – the one in the band, the one in books, the one who speaks to you while you are interviewing him, and the one who actually lives in the world. Imagine if that illustrious quartet were to form a band called the … oh well, maybe not.
An honourable mention in this category might also have gone to the New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones, had American linguistic convention not obliged him to write "The Fall is … ". If ever there was a band to challenge the primacy of the plural collective noun in Anglophone pop, you'd think (given the number of different individual destinies that ensemble has yoked to the expression of one man's artistic will) it would be The Fall. So the enduring preferability of "The Fall are … " confirms this particular round of rock's neverending transatlantic tug of war as a home win for the colonial motherland.
2. Best 180-degree turnaround, year on year
A runaway victory for the NME's Cool List. Last year's winner: chunky knitwear poster-girl Laura Marling. This year, it's super-sweary Azealia Banks. Come 2012, Derek and Clive or GG Allin may well be in with a posthumous shout.
3. Most consistently provocative use of the star system
The prize in this very competitive category goes to the Guardian's own Alex Macpherson, for following up 2010's visionary two-star dismissal of Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy with an even bolder "Texas" (as lecturers in music journalism technically term the lone-star review) for Drake's Take Care. Imagine if Macpherson and his celestial points scheme had been around in the 1960s, how the narrow critical consensus could have been opened up by giving one star to Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited ("Why does he have to go back there again? Can't he just move on like the Hollies have") or the Beatles' Revolver ("They're just going round in circles … the new Cilla Black blows these weak-ass pseudo-scousers out of the water").
4. Most imaginative seasonal feature
Faced with the choice of paying for a well-thought-through opinion piece by an alleged expert in the field, or getting an intern to ring the drummer from Dodgy and ask him what his three best X Factor singles are, all too many commissioning editors these days take the latter option. So our judges could not have helped but be won over by the trouble taken by plucky journalistic underdogs The Stool Pigeon in assembling their Christmas issue's surrealist game of literary consequences, incorporating contributions from Richard Hell, EMA, him out of Fucked Up, Robert Wyatt, Brian Eno (disruptive as ever) and a hilariously off-beam John Foxx, alongside the aforementioned Bill Callahan and Mark E Smith.
5. Best collective recovery from a potentially devastating psychological blow
The springtime publication of editorial mainstay Simon Reynolds's Retromania represented a stern examination of The Wire's esprit de corps. Here was the most eminent standard-bearer of that magazine's long-established neophiliac tendency, launching a savage (and, in my opinion, rather unfair) attack on himself for an entire career spent boosting inferior contemporary product in a desperate bid for aesthetic parity with those lucky enough to have been born five or 15 years earlier. (At least, that's what I think he means by: "Mustering all my resources of belief and optimism in an unconscious drive to cast aside that feeling of belatedness common to my generation: the negative birthright of all those who missed as a conscious participant, the 60s or punk.")
A lady does not like to be too specific about her age, but as a fellow member of Reynolds's approximate generational cohort, I personally think this mindset demonstrates a very narrow historical perspective. Rather than being upset about missing Eater or Herman's Hermits in their pomp, wouldn't it be more appropriate to feel gratitude for not having had to fight in the first world war or go to work in a Manchester cotton mill at the tender age of eight? But whether or not you accept its chronological rationale, Reynolds's unexpected mea culpa clearly had serious ideological implications for The Wire.
Reading the first couple of issues of the magazine after Reynolds's bombshell dropped was a bit like I'd imagine going to see Motorhead would be if a story had just broken about Lemmy swapping his hoard of dubious militaria for a collection of Sylvanian Families. But once The Wire began to process the shock, something entirely unexpected and really quite wonderful started to happen.
From a timely and well-executed Roy Harper cover through David Toop on the Beach Boys' Smile sessions, Byron Coley on Albert Ayler and the December issue's excellent pieces on Turkish psychedelia and kraut-rocker-turned-electro-minimalist-pioneer Manuel Göttsching, the magazine seems to have used Simon Reynolds's Jerry Maguire-style mission statement as a cue to recalibrate its troubled relationship with the past. Like a vaccine that contains a little bit of the illness, Retromania has inoculated The Wire against retrophobia. And if that's not a happy ending Charles Dickens could be proud of – and to which our notional judging panel can raise their glasses with a suitably heartwarming seasonal toast of "God bless us, every one" – I don't know what is.

This is to all the doubters who believe that James Bond films are unrealistic fiction: they are not, and if you walk through the world with open eyes and an open mind you will see evidence from time to time. Like I did last week, when I was in the beautiful city of Taormina in Sicily.
I was exploring the Ancient Theatre, both the sea and Mount Etna in sight, when I heard a faint humming approaching quickly. Being trained to identify moving objects by their sound, I couldn't believe my ears. But as it approached, it was indeed Little Nellie, the gyrocopter from the James Bond film You Only Live Twice.
This strongly suggests that all the other James Bond gadgets are real too.

If this bid for power succeeds, the consequences for Britain will be irreversible. It will privilege special interests over the public good, shut out the voices of opposition and damage the fabric of the nation, perhaps indefinitely. No, I'm not writing about the election. In the next few weeks Unesco, the United Nations cultural organisation, will decide whether or not to grant world heritage status to the Lake District. Once the decision is made, it is effectively irreversible.
Shouldn't we be proud that this grand scenery, which plays such a prominent role in our perceptions of nationhood, will achieve official global recognition? On the contrary: we should raise our voices against it. World heritage status would lock the Lake District into its current, shocking state, ensuring that recovery becomes almost impossible.
The National Trust, the sheep farm and the fight for a Lakes way of life Read more
Stand back from the fells and valleys, and try to judge this vista as you would a landscape in any other part of the world. What you will see is the great damage farming has inflicted: wet deserts grazed down to turf and rock; erosion gullies from which piles of stones spill; woods in which no new trees have grown for 80 years, as every seedling has been nibbled out by sheep; dredged and canalised rivers, empty of wildlife and dangerous to the people living downstream; tracts of bare mountainside on which every spring is a silent one. Anyone with ecological knowledge should recoil from this scene.
The documents supporting the bid for world heritage status are lavishly illustrated with photos that inadvertently reveal what has happened to the national park. But this slow-burning disaster goes almost unmentioned in the text. On the contrary, the bid repeatedly claims that the park is in “good physical condition”, and that the relationship between grazing and wildlife is “harmonious”. Only on page 535, buried in a table, does the reality acknowledge: three-quarters of the sites that are meant to be protected for nature are in “unfavourable condition”.
This great national property has degenerated into a sheepwrecked wasteland. And the national park partnership that submitted the bid wants to keep it this way: this is the explicit purpose of its attempt to achieve world heritage status. It wants to preserve the Lake District as a “cultural landscape”. But whose culture? Whose landscape?
There are only 1,080 farms in the district. Should the entire national park be managed for their benefit? If so, why? The question isn't raised, let alone answered.
I can see the value and beauty of the traditional shepherding culture in the Lake District. I can also see that the farming there, reliant on subsidies, quad bikes and steel barns, now bears little relationship to traditional practice. As the size of landholdings has increased, it looks ever more like ranching and ever less like the old system the bid describes. The bid's claim that farming there is “wholly authentic in terms of … its traditions, techniques and management systems” is neither intelligible nor true. Remnants of old shepherding culture tend to be represented ceremonially, as its customs are mostly disconnected from the farm economy.
Shepherding is not the only cultural legacy in play. The Lake District is also the birthplace of the modern conservation movement. Inspired by the Picturesque and Romantic movements, much of our environmental ethic and the groups representing it, such as the National Trust, originated here. Attempts to preserve natural beauty in the district began in the mid-18th century, with complaints against the felling of trees around Derwentwater. Today the national park cares so little for this legacy that, as the bid admits, “there are no data available” on the condition of the Lake District's woodlands.

The small group favoured by this bid sees environmental protection as anathema. Farmers' organisations in the Lake District have fought tooth and nail against conservation measures. They revile the National Trust and the RSPB, whose mild efforts to protect the land from overgrazing are, with the help of a lazy and compliant media, treated like bubonic plague. As one of these farming groups exults, world heritage status “gives us a powerful weapon” that they can wield against those who seek to limit their impacts. If the plan is approved, this world heritage site would be a 230,000-hectare monument to overgrazing and ecological destruction.
This is not the only sense in which the bid is unsustainable. Nowhere in its 700 pages is Brexit mentioned. It was obviously written prior to the referendum, and has not been updated. Yet the entire vision relies on, the bid admits, on the economic viability of the farming system – which depends in turn on subsidies from the European Union.
Without these payments, there would be no sheep farming in the Lake District: it operates at a major loss. European subsidies counteract this loss, delivering an average net farm income of £9,600. Unsurprisingly, people are leaving the industry in droves. The number of farms in the national park is declining by 2% a year. And this is before the payments cease.
The Lake District is a wildlife desert. Blame Wordsworth | George Monbiot Read more
What is the national park partnership that prepared this bid going to do – march people on to the fells at gunpoint and demand they continue farming? Or does it hope that the government, amid the massacre of public investment that will follow Brexit, will not only match but exceed the £3bn of public money currently being passed to UK farmers by the European Union? Your guess is as good as mine. This omission alone should disqualify the bid.
The failure to mention this fatal issue looks to me like one of many attempts to pull the Herdwick wool over Unesco's eyes. The entire bid is based on a fairytale, a pretence that the rural economy of the Lake District hasn't changed for 200 years. If Unesco grants world heritage status on these grounds, it will inflict irreparable harm on both our natural heritage and its own good standing.
The hills, whose clothes so many profess to admire, are naked. The narrative we are being asked to support is false. This attempt to ensure that the ecological disaster zone we call the Lake District National Park can never recover from its sheepwrecking is one long exercise in woolly thinking.

A sophisticated group of hackers known for targeting military, government and media organizations is currently using an exploit for a vulnerability in Java that hasn't been patched by Oracle.
The zero-day exploit was recently observed by researchers from antivirus vendor Trend Micro in attacks against the armed forces of an unnamed NATO country and a U.S. defense organization. Those targets received spear-phishing emails that contained links to Web pages hosting the exploit.
The cyberespionage group, known as APT28 and Pawn Storm, has been active since at least 2007. Some security vendors believe that it operates out of Russia and has ties to that country's intelligence services.
The group has been targeting NATO members and governments in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, as well as defense contractors and media organizations. It typically sends rogue emails to its victims with malicious links to supposed articles about geopolitical events.
The newly found exploit affects the latest version of the Java runtime environment, Java 8 Update 45, which was released in April, researchers from Trend Micro said in a blog post.
Surprisingly, the exploit doesn't affect the older Java 7 and Java 6 versions, which no longer receive public security patches from Oracle.
A couple of years ago Java was the most frequently attacked browser plug-in, which prompted Oracle to beef up security in Java 8.
This is the first Java zero-day exploit reported in nearly two years, the Trend Micro researchers said.
Zero-day exploits are those that target previously unknown vulnerabilities for which patches are not yet available.
Although unrelated, this exploit's discovery comes at a time when security researchers found three zero-day exploits for Flash Player in data leaked from a surveillance software maker called Hacking Team.
Disabling both Flash Player and Java is advisable until these vulnerabilities are patched, the Trend Micro researchers said in a separate blog post. "Extra caution should be exercised for the foreseeable future and special attention paid for the possibility of compromised ad servers."
"Flash and Java vulnerabilities are particularly well-suited for malvertising attacks, so we could possibly see these vulnerabilities incorporated into exploit kits that, in turn, are used to attack ad servers," the researchers said.
In fact, two of the newly found Flash Player exploits have already been integrated into exploit kits that are used in malvertising attacks.
Annual sales season is in full swing! Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Christmas Sales cause an unprecedented stock-jobbing. Everyone wants to make his or her best bargain in 2015. Besides, today there is no need in exhausting shopping in malls and emporiums. We can order everything from home with the help of the computer or smartphone.
But, in anticipation of the holidays and bargains we should not forget about the importance of data protection. After all, hackers are also preparing for the holidays. They invent new ways to celebrate them in the expense of other people. We decided to remind you the basic rules of cybersecurity, which you should follow during shopping at online stores. Following these rules, you will avoid becoming a victim of fraud, and will celebrate Christmas with joy in your eyes.
Data protection rules during online shopping:
Attachments to the letters from online stores may contain Trojan viruses. Especially those, who promise fabulous discounts. Often the references in letters from unknown emails lead to phishing sites. The only task of such websites is to steal information (card numbers, passwords). When you receive the letter from an unverified source, it is better to delete immediately. Don't open attachments and don't follow links it contains. Before you order anything in the online store and provide the information about your payment card number, spend some time to read the comments from other users of this particular website. Public Wi-Fi can be created by hackers to steal passwords and logins. We don't recommend making purchases by connecting to an open channel. If you are going to buy something using a smartphone, it is better to turn off Bluetooth and to use the mobile connection to get access to the Internet. The mobile connection provides better protection. Data protection starts with strong passwords. To be so, the password must consist of letters in different cases, numbers, and special characters. We repeat once again: the name of your pet and your own date of birth – is not the best choice for the password. On the Internet, we often meet offers to install different useful programs for free. Remember, such a “gift” can hide an adware or even Trojan virus. Two-factor authentication (2FA) should be turned on any website that holds or obtains confidential users' data. This is especially important for the resources which transfer the funds on the Internet. Among them are banks, payment systems, currency exchanges, etc. With this method of payment, the fraudsters do not even need to steal someone's plastic card. It is enough to know its number (PAN), expiration date, CVV, and the name of the owner. But if the system uses two-way authentication, then even owning all the information about the payment card and its owner, attackers will not be able to carry out any transaction on behalf of the user. One-time passwords are delivered of generated in different ways: SMS, token, email, mobile token. The most popular method of organizing data protection today presupposes the installation of a special application for one-time passwords generation on the smartphone. For example, Protectimus developed a software token Protectimus SMART, which can be installed on Android and iOS smartphones, and even on the smartwatch. Mobile authentication is enough reliable and does not require much effort from the user. In the pre-holiday fuss, it is easy to forget where and what you have already ordered. Such situation is a good field for fraudsters, who send phishing messages on behalf of the shipping services. All with the same goal: to get users' data. Make a shopping list in advance. You will be able to check if the company that has sent you the email is in your list or not. And if you can't find this company in the list, you can delete the message without hesitation. During online shopping, it is better to pay only when you have already received the goods. Everyone has heard of cases where the “sellers”, who took the money forward, dissolved in cyberspace without leaving a trace. Real representatives of payment systems or banks will never ask you to indicate the one-time password or the answer to your secret question in the letter. The bank is aware of this information. Otherwise how could it identify its customers when they log in to their accounts? If you receive such a request, be sure, it is from the hacker.
Personal data protection is not so complex not to deal with it. With a little effort, you can make the upcoming season of pre-holiday online shopping enjoyable and safe. And hackers will be left with nothing.
On September 23, JTBC's “Fantastic” held a press conference to discuss Ji Soo's current health and the drama's position regarding it.
Producer Song Won Seob said, “Ji Soo's condition has improved considerably. He is showing desire to quickly return to the set. Because his recovery is the priority we are changing conditions and waiting so that he can film comfortably when his body and mind are ready.”
The producer also discussed changes in his role and explained, “It cannot be helped that his screen time will decrease. I think it will be regrettable for Park Si Yeon. However, his character's personality and importance will not change.”
“Fantastic” has aired six episodes so far. Ji Soo's character becomes a friend and a source of strength for Park Si Yeon's character after enduring hardships with her husband and his family. Due to Ji Soo's health condition, he will not be appearing in the next few episodes.
Previously, Ji Soo received emergency surgery for osteomyelitis (inflammation of bone or bone marrow, usually due to infection) on September 13.
“Fantastic” airs on Fridays and Saturdays at 8:30 p.m. KST. You can watch the latest episode below:

In my review of academic literature around SAP or ERP implementations I find some thought provoking items. Recently I reviewed a study which helped me to form a more complete picture of important issues in IT delivery. Even though I've been writing about it for years I gained a new clarity around evaluating some of the existing delivery models [FN1]. What it comes down to is are you looking for service delivery or business results for your SAP project?
SAP Service Delivery or Business Value Delivery – You Determine Your Future
Because my career started in business and later was exposed to SAP as part of the client core team, and then finally moved on to consulting, I have always recognized the importance of business value. At the same time much of the System Integrator marketplace has been promoting the same old service delivery model they are familiar with. The biggest reason so many system integrators struggle with business value delivery is because they often focus on hiring a lot of really smart college graduates with little or no business experience. Fresh out of college and heads filled with textbook ideas about how business works.
If you just want services delivered then no matter what the sales pitch, all of the system integrators are the same
SAP, ERP, or Enterprise Application customers are looking for something more. As a recent article I read noted, CIOs do not command the respect of the other key disciplines within the enterprise. In fact, many of their “C” suite peers question whether or not the technology organization serves much of a useful purpose at all. That my friends is a frightening and shocking perspective to me. Stop and think about that a minute, many organizations question whether IT organizations serve a useful purpose in the enterprise. Is it any wonder outsourcing and off-shoring have become so popular?
What Does This Mean for SAP Projects?
At the end of your SAP project are you satisfied that a project was delivered? Hopefully on time and on budget, but delivered nonetheless? If you are satisfied that your SAP project was delivered on time and on budget then you are focused almost exclusively on service delivery.
Many senior level IT leaders and delivery folks just want something to get in as quickly as possible. This is exclusively a service delivery oriented project. The only thing you are concerned about are the skills needed to address the particular technology / application / solution need right now. This will not however provide you any type of ROI (Return on Investment) or ROE (Return on Equity) because ROI and ROE (along with other measures) are pure business metrics. These are not IT metrics and do not measure things like uptime, response time, # of service tickets closed, etc. The idea of ROI, ROE, or Asset Turns are reflections of business activity and investor / owner value. Although they may be seen as irrelevant by many in IT they are still useful to understand if any value was delivered for the investment that is made.
Do you want services delivered or business value delivered?
Truth is, if you just want services delivered then no matter what the sales pitch, all of the system integrators are the same. For that matter, why even bother with a system integrator or SAP consultants at all? Why not just go to your nearest college and recruit a bunch of really smart graduates for a temporary project and pay them about half what the system integrators charge for a temporary contract?
Seriously, why even bother with experienced consultants at all?
If SAP service delivery is your focus and not business results it is just a game of who can best make it through the sales process. Whether it is IBM and their premium rates or Rajakrishna's Consultant Shack and their all you can eat offshore rates. If they can't speak the local language it really doesn't matter. On the other hand if you are looking for business results that is entirely different.
If your only focus is on time and on budget then you are only looking for service delivery. You are not looking for results, or business change, or IT transformation, or business strategy.
Let me make clear I am not suggesting on time and on budget projects should be ignored. What I am suggesting is that if your only focus is on time and on budget then you are only looking for service delivery. You are not looking for results, or business change, or IT transformation, or business strategy. You are merely looking for resources to deliver services to get you to some date at some budget amount. Any offshore or consulting shack fake will get you to a dollar amount (that is the brutal truth but they will deliver “services”).
Where is the SAP Value Proposition Focus on Business Results?
While SAP Implementation is an Investment NOT an Event many organizations fail to consider their enterprise application deployments as strategic assets designed to produce business results. The good news is that is changing. So the next question is Where do you Start with SAP Return on Investment or SAP ROI? This goes right back to the basics, you must focus on the WHY of Achieving Business Value from SAP Investment. Is the effort about technology replacement or is there some business reason behind the initiative?
A recent IBM study under the heading of “The CIO as change catalyst” noted:
As the executive working at the nexus of business and technology, CIOs are uniquely qualified to help their companies leverage available tools to meet current economic challenges and to exploit the opportunities that will arise during this crisis—and opportunity will arise for those businesses bold enough to disrupt competition and restructure their industries. CIOs can help transform their companies by better capitalizing on the value of information assets. They can help manage and mitigate business risk through better, more timely information. They can improve service management. They can lower enterprise-wide operational costs—including IT's—through automation. [FN2]
SAP and IT organization heads are gaining insight and experience but at the same time they are being squeezed to cut costs and find value.
Focusing on value entails cutting discretionary spending, deploying resources for the highest return, bolstering core competencies and redefining relationships. Cash flow is central to survival and strategic flexibility, which means businesses and business units need to do more with less. Corporations must conserve capital and cut spending where it produces minimal return. Funds must then be redeployed to activities, products and markets that generate growth, improve margins and truly differentiate one business from another. [FN3]
Make Sure You Are Headed Down the Right SAP Path
To make the transition your SAP project must begin with Creating a Knowledge Centered Learning Organization for Business Transformation for IT Leadership. Whether you are already live with SAP, in the middle of a project, or just starting out, I would strongly encourage you to get serious about Organizational Change Management Inside the SAP IT Support Organization.
What most customers do not know is that SAP has offered the “Value Delivery” methodology as part of the ASAP Methodology for many years
If you want to know Why Use the SAP ASAP Methodology? for your SAP project consider the fact that SAP has offered the “Value Delivery” methodology as part of the ASAP Methodology for many years. Over the years it has taken many forms, all the way back to the early versions of the ASAP Methodology with the old “KPI” lists. Today it is integrated into the ASAP Methodology structure.
Isn't it time to pursue the value delivery method regardless of whether your system integrator is capable of this or not?

The scientists behind the material have dubbed it "Flink," for "functional living ink and it's composed of a hydrogel mixed with both bacteria and the nutrients required to keep that bacteria alive. It can be 3D-printed into nearly any shape, but the challenge was finding the right texture. If the ink is too stiff, the bacteria aren't be able to move and in some cases aren't able to secrete useful products, limiting their benefits. However, if it's too thin, the structures aren't able to hold their shapes. "The ink must be as viscous as toothpaste and have the consistency of Nivea hand cream," said Manuel Schaffner, a researcher on the project.
The research is in the early stages, but the ink could be used in many different ways. In the study, the researchers showed that with one type of bacteria, the ink could be used to break down a toxic chemical often produced as a byproduct in the chemical industry while a second type of bacteria that naturally secretes cellulose could be used in medical applications, like burn treatments and skin replacements, for example. With other species of bacteria, the researchers envision uses for cleaning up oil spills, sensing toxins in drinking water or studying how bacteria form biofilms.
The next steps are to find ways of speeding up printing times and scaling up production.
Jeremy Corbyn has warned the EU need to change if the UK stays as he defended the current migration rules in a sustained attack on Rangers shareholder Mike Ashley.
The Labour leader said that he was "not a lover" of the Eu as he urged the organisation to become more democratic and accountable.
Wealthy EU nations should “share our wealth” to help improve living standards at home and across Europe, he said.
But he defended the free movement of labour within the EU, just hours after similar comments infuriated some of his own MPs.
Mr Corbyn said that open borders within the EU were necessary for the single market.

Instead he hit out at employers, including Sports Direct boss Mr Ashley, who he said exploited migrant workers.
He accused Mr Ashley's firm of employing "most" of its overseas workers on controversial zero-hours contracts.
He added: “People we should not blame are the migrants workers.. the people we should blame are the companies.”
In his only televised showdown of the campaign Mr Corbyn, who has been accused by some within his own side of running a reluctant campaign because of his own qualms about the EU, warned that remaining part of the 28-member bloc had "implications".
He said that his support for a Remain vote was "not unconditional by any means".
He hit out at the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTI), being negotiated between the EU and the US.

And he said of Thursday's vote: "It's a big decision. If we stay in Europe there are implications, if we leave Europe there are massive implications.
"But, it is also a turning point because if we leave I don't think there is an easy way back. If we remain, I believe Europe has got to change quite dramatically to something much more democratic, much more accountable and share our wealth and improve our living standards and our working conditions all across the whole continent."
He said that he was voting to stay in the EU because it was the best way to solve problems like climate change and the current refugee crisis.
But he suggested that he would defy EU rules to protect the steel industry and renationalise the railways if he was prime minister.
Mr Corbyn said he voted against the Maastricht Treaty in 1993 because it was about creating a Thatcherite free market Europe with little protection for workers, and that the 2007 Lisbon Treaty was "a step in the same direction".
But the EU social chapter has won protections for workers such as four weeks holiday and maternity and paternity leave, he added.
Asked whether he had changed his mind after meeting other European leaders such as French president Mr Hollande, he said: "My head hasn't been turned by anything, my head doesn't get turned."
Today (TUES) Mr Corbyn will say that the decision comes down to one crucial question: "What's best for jobs in Britain, rights at work and our future prosperity? "
Polls suggest that Labour voters could decide the outcome.
Earlier this month Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson admitted that around 4 in 10 of the party's traditional supporters did not know where it stood on the EU.
'You are the demon. I know what I must do': Dad high on meth drags son, 11, into woods for an 'exorcism' then launches 'crazed attack' on cops as they arrive just in time to save the boy
A Florida man high on meth who was arrested in a violent confrontation with police after dragging his son into the woods reportedly believed the 11-year-old required an exorcism.
'You are the demon, you are the demon,' authorities say Bryan Adams told his son after taking him from his bedroom. 'I know what I must do with you.'
Okeechobee County police say the 31-year-old showed 'no compliance or showing of pain and abnormal strength.'
Exorcism: Florida man Bryan Adams allegedly attacked police after kidnapping his own son and dragging him into the woods and attempting to exorcise his 'demons'
Adams' son is uninjured, but the same could not be said for Adams after the January 16 arrest.
According to the police report, officers including a K9 first found Adams and the boy on the ground amidst thick vegetation.
It's unclear exactly when police became involved, but Adams' estranged wife told police she'd left her husband because of his heavy crystal meth use.
Earlier in the day, she said he'd showed up at her work demanding her car keys and threatening to take the children, according to WPBF.
It was just after 3am when Adams snatched his son from this own bed and took him to the woods while he still wore his pyjamas.
'I know what I must do': Adams was reportedly high on meth and believed his 11-year-old was possessed, so he took him to the woods while spouting ominous nonsense
Police say they grabbed the boy, who was unharmed, but when they went for Adams, he bolted into the soggy underbrush.
'I then observed Bryan getting up off the ground and lunging at Deputy Hazy. Bryan then turned around and began punching me in the chest with both hands,' Deputy Leland Schoonmaker. 'One wrist did have a handcuff on it and he was swinging it around as he was punching me.'
During the confrontation, police say Adams repeated: 'I have to stop the demons. I have to do it.'
Adams began to hit the dog even as officers used a Taser on him.
He was finally restrained after Deputy Mark Margerum reatliated against the crazed man's onslaught and '... punched Bryan in the face approximately five times with [his] right hand.'
Adams was held at the Okeechobee County jail on $170,000 bond.

Gaming headsets meet gyroscopes and accelerometers on a new Kickstarter project called the Booster One. Borrowing the split-headband design of modern classics like the Sennheiser HD25, and using the now-ubiquitous aluminum for their construction, the Booster Ones aren't all that unusual in their looks. Where they differ from most is in tracking the motions of your head and using them to perform in-game actions.
If you've always dreamed of using your neck to do something more productive than just keeping your head from falling off, these might be just the ticket. The Kickstarter page shows off a few usage scenarios, such as switching weapons or activating abilities by turning left or right, but the most compelling among them seems to be scrolling the map on strategy games. Everything else just looks unnatural and probably uncomfortable over longer periods of time.
I like that this Kickstarter project is being run by a group of five young guys who are obviously enthusiastic about gaming, but that's also what makes me hesitant to endorse the product. They'll presumably have to code compatibility with each game themselves, and the challenges of procuring reliable suppliers and manufacturing partners are not to be underestimated. It's one thing to build a few rough prototypes and produce a fun campaign video, and it's a whole other matter to turn that into a retail reality.
The Booster One will cost a not insignificant $349 should it ever wind its way to retail shelves, but you can still get the super early bird price of $199 today. You'll just have to be patient until the anticipated August shipping date (and optimistic about everything working out, but that's always the way with Kickstarter).
Advertisement 10 Commandments statue must be removed from state Capitol, Oklahoma Supreme Court rules Share Shares Copy Link Copy
A Ten Commandments monument on the Oklahoma Capitol grounds is a religious symbol and must be removed because it violates the state's constitutional ban on using public property to benefit a religion, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.The court said the Ten Commandments chiseled into the 6-foot-tall granite monument, which was privately funded by a Republican legislator, are "obviously religious in nature and are an integral part of the Jewish and Christian faiths."The 7-2 ruling overturns a decision by a district court judge who determined the monument could stay. It prompted calls by a handful of Republican lawmakers for impeachment of the justices who said the monument must be removed.Attorney General Scott Pruitt had argued that the monument was historical in nature and nearly identical to a Texas monument that was found constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Oklahoma justices said the local monument violated the state's constitution, not the U.S. Constitution. The Attorney General Office's has filed for a rehearing in the case.Private funds were used to erect the monument in 2012. Since then, others have asked for space, including a Nevada Hindu leader, animal rights advocates, the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and a group pushing for a Satan statue.Gov. Mary Fallin's representatives said she is talking to Pruitt about the state's legal options about the statue's ordered removal. Pruitt's representatives said the attorney general's office will explore legal options after it is finished reviewing the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision.Pruitt released this statement:“Quite simply, the Oklahoma Supreme Court got it wrong. The court completely ignored the profound historical impact of the Ten Commandments on the foundation of Western law. Furthermore, the court's incorrect interpretation of Article 2, Section 5 contradicts previous rulings of the court. In response, my office will file a petition with the court for a rehearing in light of the broader implications of this ruling on other areas of state law. Additionally, we are requesting a stay of the enforcement of the court's order until the court can consider the petition for rehearing. Finally, if Article 2, Section 5 is going to be construed in such a manner by the court, it will be necessary to repeal it.” Pruitt said his office would ask the court for a rehearing and that the monument will be allowed to stay until the court considers his request. Pruitt also suggested the provision in the Oklahoma Constitution that prohibits the use of public money for religious purposes may need to be repealed.Ryan Kiesel, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, which represented the plaintiffs in the case, said Pruitt's suggestion and the calls for impeachment amounted to sour grapes."I think the idea that you go about amending the constitution every time you lose a court battle is a dangerous precedent for anyone to engage in, but in particular for the state's highest attorney to do so," Kiesel said. "And the calls for impeachment represent a fundamental misunderstanding of how an independent judiciary functions within our system of democratic government."Since the original monument was erected in 2012, several other groups have asked to put up their own monuments on the Capitol grounds. Among them is a group that wants to erect a 7-foot-tall statue that depicts Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, wings and a long beard. A Hindu leader in Nevada, an animal rights group, and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster also have made requests.Rep. Mike Ritze, a Republican from Broken Arrow whose family paid about $10,000 for the monument's construction, pushed the bill authorizing the monument. He said he hoped the attorney general would appeal the ruling.The original monument was smashed into pieces in October, when someone drove a car across the Capitol lawn and crashed into it. A 29-year-old man who was arrested the next day was admitted to a hospital for mental health treatment, and formal charges were never filed.A new monument was built and put up in January.

T-Bowl Concept Restaurant, Kuala Lumpur
It has come to my attention over the past few years while partaking in the Toilography project that there are a handful of toilet-themed restaurants dotted around this crazy wide world. That's right folks: actual eateries where the decor consists of life-size basins, bowls & bathroom accessories; where drinks arrive in toilet teacups and food is served on powder-room plates.
The first of these such diners I became aware of was Modern Toilet, a Taiwanese institution founded in 2004 that has since expanded across the country and even branched out into Hong Kong. However more recently I discovered the existence of a second toilet restaurant chain based in Malaysia, with the apt name of T-Bowl Concept Restaurant. It is claimed the idea behind this particular concept came to fruition while the owner, Samuel, was one day sitting on the loo, pondering what it would be like to eat whilst undergoing his business. It wasn't long until the entrepreneur opened his first T-Bowl restaurant in Penang in 2008, followed by a second outlet in Kuala Lumpur in 2009.
I was recently lucky enough to stop by Kuala Lumpur on a day-trip following a weekend in Singapore, and I couldn't help but drop into Sungei Wang Plaza to witness this unique lavatory lunchroom for myself!
I arrived in the early/mid-afternoon, just following what I assume was the busy lunch period. The eatery itself was closed for cleaning, and after a quick glance of the inside adornments I was instead ushered to a food court area in front of the restaurant. Although still featuring a bathroom backdrop with basins to eat at and toilet bowls to sit on, this open area in the centre of the plaza didn't quite have the same atmosphere as the inner space that I'd missed the opportunity of dining in. Thankfully the room opened back up by the time I finished my meal, and the wait staff kindly allowed me to walk through the inside and snap a few photos:
The selection of food on the menu was affordable and relatively broad with a large emphasis on Japanese & Korean cuisine, but also featuring some western, Taiwanese and traditional oriental items. I ordered the grilled chicken in turmeric sauce along with a side of fresh fruit and some hot wulong tea. Of course the main course came served to me in a toilet-themed dish, with the fruit and tea appearing in similarly-themed receptacles.
The food was surprisingly delicious considering my awkward surroundings, and as an added bonus for dessert: just for liking their Facebook page and checking in with a photo, I scored myself a free chocolate ice cream! (Yes, the ice cream too was presented in a toilet bowl – not to mention the appropriate shape of the frozen treat) 🙂
I'm happy to say that my first experience at a toilet-themed restaurant was a positive and interesting one, and I left with an intrigue as to exactly how such a concept seems to have taken off in popularity throughout Asia. If you ever find yourself in Malaysia then this is your perfect opportunity to try something a little different from the norm. I highly suggest you drop by and grab yourself a meal there.
You can find more information on the T-Bowl Concept Restaurant at their website and also their Facebook page.

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: We end today's show with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges and Eddie Glaude, chair of the Department of African American Studies at Princeton University. Chris Hedges began by talking about his new piece, “Donald Trump: The Dress Rehearsal for Fascism.”
CHRIS HEDGES: Well, that's what we're watching. Trump, for all his shallowness and narcissism and imbecility and self-destructiveness, nevertheless has been able to run a fairly close race with Hillary Clinton. We saw from the leaked Podesta emails that the Clinton machine promoted, consciously promoted, especially through the press, what they call these “Pied Piper” candidates, listing Trump, Cruz and—I forget the third—Trump and Carson. And the idea was that they wanted to give them legitimacy. They wanted to push the more mainstream candidates, like Jeb Bush, closer to the lunatic fringe. And that's because, fundamentally, there is no difference between Hillary Clinton and a figure like Mitt Romney. You know, what they're battling about is what Freud called the narcissism of minor difference.
And the danger with this election is that the longer the policies of neoliberalism, austerity, the security and surveillance state—in essence, the paralysis on the part of our corporate state to deal with the suffering, grievances and mounting rage of now over half the country who live in poverty—the more these lunatic fringe candidates like Trump, these figures of ridicule—reminds me very much of what happened in Yugoslavia. The economic meltdown of Yugoslavia vomited up figures like Radovan Karadzic, Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudman, who were buffoonish figures before they achieved political power, much like of the Nazi Party in Weimar. And I think that's what we're watching. And if we don't reverse the structural mechanisms by which we are disenfranchising and refusing to deal with the most fundamental rights and issues affecting now a majority of the American population, then we will get a fascist or a kind of quasi-protofascist, Christianized fascism, embodied in a figure with a little more intelligence and political savvy than Trump. And that's why I find this election so frightening and so dangerous.
I think it's the fact that the power elites, embodied by figures like the Clintons and Barack Obama, have been utterly, utterly tone deaf to what's happening, and are playing a very, very dangerous game by, on the one hand, promoting a figure like Trump, because, of course, his outrageousness gives her a kind of credibility, without understanding that another four years of what's been happening—and it won't be an effective political strategy anymore, and it won't be funny.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Professor Eddie Glaude, let's get your perspective on this. Earlier in the summer, you wrote a piece called “My Democratic Problem with Voting for Hillary Clinton.” Now, some say that Clinton's victory is now more or less a foregone conclusion. You also talked about the necessity of strategic voting. Can you talk about both the arguments that you've made in light of where we stand today in the campaign and with the election less than a month away?
EDDIE GLAUDE: Sure. You know, I think that it is—it is reasonable to conclude that Hillary Clinton is going to win. I think the internal polling for the Republican—on the Republican side suggests that Donald Trump is going to go down pretty badly, that it's going to be a pretty decisive victory. Some, like Steve Schmidt, are predicting that she's going to win upward to 400—get to 400 in the Electoral College, some at 380. People are declaring that this is going to be the destruction of the Republican Party.
And a lot of this has to do with, right, the fact that Donald Trump moves between being, as I've said before, a lunatic and an adolescent. And we can talk about him, but in kind of orienting us to this campaign, to this election cycle, by emphasizing the ridiculousness of and the bombasity of Donald Trump, we have turned our attention away from, I think, Hillary Clinton and the policies that have defined the Democratic Party up to this point. And I think Donald Trump is just an exaggerated indication of the rot that's at the heart of the country, and that Hillary Clinton is the poster child for, I think, a failed economic policy that has left so many fellow Americans behind, and particularly the most vulnerable.
So what I've said is that we needed to suggest to Hillary Clinton that—and suggest to the Democratic Party that business as usual was no longer acceptable and that I couldn't vote for and I couldn't do that—I can do that because I'm in a blue state, and that there are some who are in a red state who can vote their conscience, but if you're in a battleground state, it makes all the sense in the world, given who Trump is, to not vote for her—to vote for—to not vote for Hillary Clinton—I mean, to not vote for Trump and to vote for Hillary Clinton.
So, in this case, part of what I'm trying to suggest is that we need to be very mindful in this moment, even as we say she's going to win. We need to understand who she's appointing as her transition team. We need to understand that personnel is policy. We need to see what her position will really be in terms of how she will govern economically, who she's going to pick and choose for attorney general position, who's going to populate her government. And I think once we get a better sense or if we pay attention to what she's doing, we will be even better mobilized and organized to bring pressure to bear on her presidency, once November 8th happens.
AMY GOODMAN: So, what do you think about this, Chris Hedges, this idea of strategic voting?
CHRIS HEDGES: I think it's an utter failure. I mean, one of the things that the WikiLeaks Podesta emails showed is that they were putting in place this neoliberal policy—Froman, who was then a—he's now a U.S. trade representative. He, at the time, was at Citibank. In October, before Obama even achieved power, he's sending out a list of Cabinet positions, all of which—most all of which came to pass. That's certainly happening now.
I think that we have to step outside this corporate, two-party duopoly and begin to empower right now the third party, you know, that I think represents or challenges corporate power most effectively, is the Green. It has issues. You know, it functions well in cities like Richmond, California, doesn't function as well in other places. But if they can poll 15 percent, that gives them ballot access in 2020 in a few dozen states, and it gives them $10 million. And I think that now is the time to, as Syriza did a decade ago, to fight back, because we have very little time left.
One of the things we have to remember is that we have a large number of supporters of Donald Trump who celebrate American violence through the gun culture, open racism, neo-Confederist movements, nativist movements. And Trump, I think, has made clear now, on the campaign trail, that he will essentially attempt to discredit the system if he loses. And right now they are working within the system. But unleashing that rage, you know, or essentially legitimizing that rage and that kind of violence after the election will begin to really rend the fabric of American society.
We have no more time to play around. We haven't even spoken about the issue of climate change. We know, from the leaked emails, that Hillary Clinton is a fan of fracking. She brags about promoting fracking in Poland and other places as secretary of state. We just—the kind of weakness of the system itself cannot, I think, sustain much more of this assault without dramatic and frightening blowback and ramifications. And I think Trump is systematic of that.
So, as I've said many times, I think we have to do what many—Podemos and many parties in Europe have done. We have to walk into the political wilderness. We have to build movements, and we have to build alternative third parties that challenge this system, because the inevitable result is a kind of frightening police state. Well, legally, it's already in place, physically, in marginal communities. They've been turned virtually into mini police states. The system of mass incarceration will not be affected in any meaningful way. Of course, it was the Clintons that put much of it in place. We just saw this very courageous prisoner strike, where the prisoners did work stoppages because, they said, the only way to stop this system of neoslavery is to stop being a slave. And I think that is a level of political consciousness that the rest of us have to begin to attain.
AMY GOODMAN: So, Professor Glaude, your response to Chris Hedges' rejection of strategic voting?
EDDIE GLAUDE: Well, I think we agree on principle. And part of what I think—where we agree is that we have to keep Trump out of office. And the question for me is that: How do we do that? And one of the ways I'm thinking we need to do it is to vote strategically. And that is, in those places where we can, for me, blank out or vote for Jill Stein, we should. And in those places where—the battleground states, where it matters, where Trump has a chance to win, I think we need to turn out in massive numbers and make sure that he doesn't win those states. I think we have to do two things simultaneously.
And I think he's right in this regard: I think that what we've seen and what we've witnessed in this moment is the bankruptcy of a particular economic ideological philosophy that has left so many—so many people behind. And I think we need to dare to imagine a new world. But I think it's going to require strategic and tactical thinking. And I think, on its face, Chris and I aren't disagreeing. I just think there are ways to get to the same—to the same end.
AMY GOODMAN: Eddie Glaude, chair of the Department of African American Studies at Princeton University, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chris Hedges.

Editor's note: This article originally appeared in the April 1861 issue of Scientific American.
I was introduced into the watchmakers workshops by M. Vlande, one of the merchants of Geneva, a man of great humanity, and also of rare amiability of disposition and character. I could not have had a better guide, even with regard to the moral inquiries which I wished to make.
We began with the schools of pupils, where young girls learn, for a term of three years, to make every part of a watch. After this time, they select that particular part for which they have most inclination, or in the doing of which they are most expert. Te perfected pupils may be sure, on leaving the school, of obtaining immediate employment among the watchmakers. Young girls from 12 to 18 years of age appear very healthy and well cared for. Each one has her own little table and her own window niche for her work.
The manufacture of pocket-watches is, at the present time, carried to a great extent in Geneva. An immense number is required for the Chinese market. A well-equipped Chinaman, I have been told, carries a watch on each side of his breast, that he may be able to regulate the one by the other. Wealthy Chinese cover the walls of their rooms with watches. These watches are of a more ornamental character, and have more filigree work upon them than those made for Europeans. Long live the Chinese!
At one of the greatest and best conducted manufactories of Geneva nothing but watch faces are prepared, and elderly, well-dressed and well-looking women sat by twenties and thirties in clean, well-warmed rooms, working upon watch faces.
'Do you not get tired of always doing the same work?' I inquired of some of them.
'Oh, no!' replied they, and showed me that each little dial had to pass through fifty different operations before it was finished. This kept the attention awake, and prevented any sense of monotony. They work here from eight o' clock in the morning till six or seven in the evening, and thus earn about 50 francs a month.
'Are you able to lay by anything for old age, or in case of sickness?' I inquired from a mother who had worked there with her daughter, side by side, for ten years.
'On, no!' they replied, 'we have no longer been able to do that, since provision have been so dear.'
'Nor yet for a little journey of pleasure of holiday in the summer?'
'We never think of such a thing. We should be that means lose, not only our money, but also our time, and possibly our place.'
'Is not such a life as this heavy and void of interest?'
'We have Sundays for rest and refreshment, and the evenings for reading or occupation of another kind. Besides which, we need not, during our work, be continually thinking about it.'
The seemed perfectly satisfied.
The workwomen who are able to execute certain more difficult parts of the watch get higher wages, and can earn from five to ten francs a day.
In the meantime, this great division of labor causes the great part of the women not to earn much more than their maintenance.
'My grandmother made whole watches!' said an old woman, with a sigh who was now sitting at home with her daughter, employed in one single operation in a little cog for the great manufactory, 'and at that time women were much higher in the work than they are now, and also got higher payment. They were few in number, but extremely dexterous. Now they are innumerable, but their dexterity is employed upon a mere nothing--a very crumb.'
And this was true as far as the old woman was concerned, for the whole of her work consisted in drilling one little hole in a small steel plate, with a little machine which resembled a tiny spinning wheel. Her daughter was seated at another little machine, and was merely making a little alteration in the hole which her mother had drilled; and six hundred of such holes must be made before they could earn three francs.
A Nevadan couple is fighting back after law enforcement in Kansas seized $32,100 in cash. Back in March, Salvador Franco and his girlfriend, Liliana Ramirez, were driving along I-70 after having just decided not to buy a truck in cash. While stopped at a gas station, a Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper confronted Franco for not having a front license plate, though that is not illegal in Kansas.
When Franco refused to consent to a search, the officer detained him and called for a drug dog, even though the Supreme Court has ruled that police cannot extend a routine traffic stop to bring a drug dog to the scene absent probable cause. When the dog alerted, police used that as justification to search the car. Inside, they found Franco's cash, but no drugs or anything else illegal.
Nevertheless, troopers handcuffed the couple and brought them to the police station, where they were interrogated separately and threatened with 10 years in prison. Despite filing no criminal charges, Kansas police seized the cash.
“On that day my whole life changed,” Franco said. “I was robbed by our own police officers that are here to protect and serve us.”
Kansas law enforcement then worked with a federal prosecutor to forfeit the seized cash through the federal equitable sharing program. Under this program, state and local law enforcement agencies can partner with federal agencies, like the Drug Enforcement Administration, to forfeit seized property under federal law, and receive as much as 80 percent of the proceeds. According to the Institute for Justice's report Policing for Profit, from 2000 to 2013, Kansas law enforcement received more than $50 million in federal forfeiture funds from the Justice Department, or over $3.7 million a year on average.
To help Franco reclaim his seized cash, DKT Liberty Project has hired David Smith. Smith, a former deputy chief at the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture Office, said his client's “individual freedom and civil liberties were violated.”
In response to widespread controversy, in 2015, the Department of Justice limited certain seizures under the equitable sharing program, including imposing guidelines on “joint investigations” like the one ostensibly involved here. Franco's case shows how these policy changes are woefully insufficient to curb forfeiture abuse. Congress should abolish equitable sharing altogether. Short of that, Congress must pass legislative reform, such as the DUE PROCESS Act which would, at the very least, strengthen procedural protections for innocent property owners.
For as long as I've been blogging about being a parent raising a daughter in the shadow of princess culture, I've had online feedback suggesting I check out the Little Pony: Friendship is Magic cartoon (aka MLP:FiM).
At first, I ignored them. What were they thinking? These people clearly didn't understand I wanted to show my daughter content with themes of female empowerment and self-confidence; to find stories and characters that didn't patronise young girls; that had imaginative female led tales of action and adventure yet with stimulating and thought provoking scenarios. My Little Pony was surely part of the problem – not the solution. Yet, the recommendations kept on coming, from even the most feminist community members. Could it be true? Could My Little Pony – which in my mind typified the kind of content I was opposed to – really provide a substantive alternative to Disney Princesses? So with some (many) reservations, one afternoon we took the plunge and watched it.
Is My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic the princess alternative I'm looking for?
I couldn't quite believe it. My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic is a delightful, smart, funny, really well written & animated show – that most importantly treated its intended audience of young girls with respect and intelligence. I was rather gobsmacked. And an instant fan…
While it has the colours, the coiffed manes, the “cutie marks”, and the like from its 80s stablemate I was judging it from – it also has a ‘hip' factor that really surprised me. But above all it is the core of distinctive female characters that make this show. There is a character here for everyone, but to be honest even the least favoured ones have endearing qualities.
Creator Lauren Faust was inspired by her love of the toys as a child, but how the cartoons of the 80s failed to live up to the adventures in her imagination and play. Well, this new incarnation is full of creativity and adventure.
The set up is this (some spoilers): Princess Celestia, ruler of Equestria sends bookish unicorn Twilight Sparkle to the town of Ponyville to study the magic of friendship. She forms bonds with cowgirl apple farmer Applejack, high-energy Rainbow Dash, party girl Pinkie Pie, animal lover Fluttershy, and fashionista Rarity.
It turns out each one represents one of the ‘Elements of Harmony': Honesty, Loyalty, Laughter, Generosity, and Kindness. Twilight Sparkle is the last element – Magic. Also in the mix is Celestia's sister Princess Luna, a dragon called Spike, and all sort of sub-characters and adventures…
It may sound confusing and/or convoluted – but my point in going through this is I think there's real thought been put into setting the scene for female led tales of magic, adventure, and friendship. Lauren Faust has admitted that while the show is riddled with pink, has princesses, and that she was somewhat at the behest of Hasbro's needs to sell toys – she and her team tried to manage this with integrity and creativity. I think they succeeded brilliantly.
Isn't My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic just a silly girly cartoon?
In an early defence of the show, creator Lauren Faust said: “…many people without even watching the show (will) label it girly, stupid, cheap, for babies or an evil corporate commercial. I encourage skeptics like this to watch My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic with an open mind. If I'm doing my job right, I think you'll be surprised.”
I would take issue with one thing she said – that labelling the show ‘girly' is derogatory. Why? Perhaps one of Lauren Faust's achievements is that My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic helps redefine the word ‘girly' to no longer be an insult.
‘Girly' should simply mean something that is of – or for – girls, and not judging because it is. I have not mentioned the pony in the room – the brony. Male fans (of which I must now count myself) are collectively referred to as ‘Bronies', and we are many. So while the show may have been made to for girls, this doesn't mean that boys won't like it either.
Is ‘My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic' feminist?
Of course it's feminist. Completely so. Unashamedly so. This is a show created by a woman, about female characters supporting each other, in a land ruled by a female, where the default for any additional character is female, in a show that absolutely doesn't patronise the intended audience of little girls with an assumption of frivolous interests alone. Feminism – as well as friendship – is magic.
My wife commented on an episode the other day. It involved two ponies engaged in a sporting rivalry who faced off in a sporting tournament. She observed that when growing up she would NEVER have seen a cartoon or TV show where two female characters engaged in a testing physical sporting competition. She only ever saw males doing that.
This is a show that resets the norm from the male default. There are male characters (most notably Spike the baby dragon) but they are supporting cast – the norm is female. This is a cartoon that I cannot imagine has a single episode which doesn't pass the Bechedel Test.
In many ways, the show reminded me of the cheery empowering tone of Amy Poehler's Lesley Knope in Parks and Recreation – I think if Knope had a favourite cartoon, it would be My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic.
Lauren Faust's involvement tailed off after season 1 (which we are currently watching). The reasons for Lauren Faust leaving My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic have never been made clear.
Perhaps it was the struggles mentioned earlier – in trying to balance her desire to make a great show for girls with the desire for Hasbro to market the toys their way? Perhaps it was other ‘creative differences'.
I hope the adventurous empowering tone of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic continues in subsequent seasons. We shall definitely see, as my daughter and I are now hooked – so will continue watching the show despite Faust's departure. On a recent foreign holiday, we picked up our first MLP toys, something I NEVER thought I would happily buy for our daughter. My transformation to a Brony-dad of a daughter is complete.

It's nearly August, the retail fashion industry is in an uneasy slump, and summer issues of women's magazines are gaunt for want of advertising. Yet in the past four weeks, the 'black issue' of Italian Vogue has caused such a phenomenal demand at news-stands in Britain and the United States that Condé Nast, the publisher, has rushed to reprint and distribute 40,000 more copies.
The explosive content of what, by any standards, is a small-circulation magazine with an average monthly sale of 109,000, is now being spoken about as a cultural watershed in fashion. With the next show season six weeks off, its influence might finally end the 'white-out' that has come to dominate catwalks and magazine pages.
On Friday, a saleswoman on the till at WH Smith in Hammersmith Mall, west London, was proudly gesturing to a Vogue Italia propped up at her cashdesk. 'We've managed to get 10 more,' she said, as a group of black and mixed-race schoolgirls broke ranks in the queue and doubled back to the shelves, hollering with delight. They have reason to celebrate, and to hope. One of the covers of Vogue Italia features Jourdan Dunn, the 18-year-old who was discovered by a Storm scout at Primark in that same mall. Perhaps those girls were her former classmates.
Conceived by editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, and shot by Steven Meisel from a roster of 18 new, established and former stars, the July 'black issue' sold out in Britain on arrival. That renowned fashion photographer Steven Meisel, the recluse whose lens has made the career of many a model (including Brits Lily Cole and Karen Elson) should be focusing on non-white subjects might have been expected to cause some debate. A mild examination of conscience among the model scouts, agencies, casting directors and designers was privately anticipated, without much hope of anything changing - in the same way that the endless skinny-model debate has resulted in little or no change in the industry. But no one anticipated the global interest.
'It has been unprecedented, a sensation, although that wasn't the aim,' said Jonathan Newhouse, chairman of Condé Nast International, who masterminded the reprinting and rerouting of unsold magazines in Italy to America and Britain. In America, the issue is shrink-wrapped and stickered with the words 'First Reprint. The Most Wanted Issue Ever'.
That is no hype, according to the Kenya Hunt, the young black style editor of Metro International News in New York. 'I've been watching the news-stands since the beginning. There are lines of women when they hear of a new shipment. It's a wide cross-section of women, girls, people my parents' age who read Ebony,' she said. 'There have been email chains about it. The news-stand guys are hustling, locking it up in the back and charging $25, $28, when the real price is $16. Yesterday, I saw it on eBay for $50. There is a climate shift. This is the year of the presidential election. And this at a time when magazine sales are really hurting.'
British retail newsagents, who are often reluctant to allot shelf-space to any non-populist publication, have also been scrambling to satisfy waves of people wanting to get their hands on the £6.50 edition. Border has had to move issues around the country after a first-day sell-out, saying that demand was 654 per cent up on the previous issue. WH Smith's women's magazine head buyer Louisa Stokes confirmed: 'I took so many queries from customers and from individual store managers - I've not seen anything like it. Italian Vogue is normally delivered to only 45 stores, but customers all over the country are asking for it.'
The first printing was so scarce in London that Edward Enninful, the black Notting Hill-born Vogue fashion editor, who worked with Meisel to style the Naomi Campbell cover (one of three versions of the edition) was forced to scour the country for an issue. 'I couldn't believe it. I ended up phoning friends in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, who found one for me in a corner newsagent. I am so excited. I never thought I would be able to see something like this - my people, my race, wearing the collections, being gorgeous, chic, real women in that way. But the most important thing is: this proves we are bankable. We can sell.'
That, of course, is the point. Evidence of commerciality, especially in anxious times, is more likely to shift industry thinking than any amount of political correctness. For years, the excuse proffered by advertising agencies for not signing black models to lucrative contracts, and by magazine editors who failed to feature women of colour on their covers, was a supposedly factual, 'they don't sell'.
Certainly, part of the grand rebuttal has been organised through the internet, influencing an industry that is far too used to listening to its own circle of insider voices.
Sola Oyebade, chief executive of Mahogany Model Management, has been running a Facebook, text and email campaign in an attempt to make the issue the biggest-selling Vogue ever. 'We believe there's industry apartheid and this is something that the black community does feel very strongly about. I've had so many calls from people asking where they can get their hands on a copy. I've had shops like Harvey Nichols ring me up, telling me we're causing them a lot of problems with supply, so we've been liaising with them, too. Our fashion industry is institutionally racist. The explanation for why they don't use black models is always that we don't sell, but this shows that's not true. Black people are among the highest consumer spenders in the UK for material goods.'
Agencies are busy scrambling to catch up. London-based, Nigerian-born designer Duro Olowu has fought to cast black girls in his show for the past three seasons. 'I'd phone agencies, and there would be silence. Now, people will have a responsibility to make sure they have black models in their shows,' he said. 'Anybody who doesn't will look an idiot.'
However, the truth is that it has taken two central establishment leaders - Sozzani and Meisel - to make the subject even discussable in fashion circles.
Just a few months ago, anyone who voiced opinions like Olowu's would have been regarded as naïve, eccentric or speaking out of turn and in danger of ostracism. 'I wrote a piece about the absence of black models a year ago,' said Kenya Hunt. 'and no one wanted to talk about it.' Now, she says, everyone is rushing to quote it.
As Sarah Doukas of Storm, the agency that discovered Jourdan Dunn and manages Alek Wek, put it, the success of the 'black issue' 'has implications for all of us to now fully embrace the diversity within our industry, and to exploit our creative resources to celebrate our cultural and social differences.'
It is, after all, a long overdue wake-up call for an industry whose precarious future will rely on reaching global markets that do not resemble the freakish army of half-starved six-foot white girls who have come to represent the Western ideal.
As Barack Obama has it, it's time for a change. Though it may seem forced to link politics with fashion, history proves that the dominant aesthetic of any era can only reflect the mood of the times. And just as in politics, what just might revolutionise fashion now is that enough white people, too, are bored to death and impatient with the way things look out there.
Speaking out
Jourdan Dunn, the teenage supermodel who was first spotted in a Primark store in west London, was interviewed in The Observer Magazine in April after she had criticised London fashion week - and its catwalks - for being too white. She spoke about race and role models ...
· On being spotted: 'Everybody says I was spotted shopping in Primark. I wasn't shopping, I was with my friend. She wanted to go in, I wanted to go home - and we were just mucking about in the sunglasses section.'
· On her comments about London Fashion Week and race: 'It needs to be said because I think about these things and other girls do, too.'
· On the reaction to what she said: 'The way people said I was stupid made me feel horrible, saying fashion's a business so they need to use models who sell things.'
· On Naomi Campbell's plan to establish a modelling agency to promote different races: 'Naomi's idea is good. I'd do an agency for black girls and Asian and Spanish, because there aren't enough of them on the runway either.'
· On posing: 'I like having spikes coming out of my head or being in something I'd never wear.'
· On being away from home: 'I miss out on getting on my brothers' nerves, so when I get back I have to get on their nerves on purpose to catch up.'
The University of Oregon�s new police chief, Matthew Carmichael, wasn�t subtle in July when he was trying out for the UO job.
�I�ll tell you right now,� he said in a public presentation, �I�m probably one of the best in the country. I�m not pompous, but I�m confident.�
Carmichael, who was named the next chief Wednesday, is expected to begin Sept. 12. His record at the University of California, Davis, where he�s been chief since November 2011, is noteworthy in several ways.
When UC Davis students were riled about the spate of police shootings of unarmed black men, Carmichael, who is white, stood in uniform with black student leaders in a show of support. �Saying that black lives matter doesn�t offend me, and quite frankly, to be perfectly open with my position, it shouldn�t offend anyone else,� he said in July.
�There is a historic, systematic issue with my profession and racism, with conscious and (sub)conscious biases,� he said. �To watch something that�s obviously wrong and not to speak up about it is consent. Silence is consent.�
At UC Davis, Carmichael inherited a beleaguered department with no trust between officers and community members, according to news stories.
He sought to rebuild trust by launching independent, civilian oversight in the form of a Police Accountability Board made up of students, faculty and community members.
�You have to have oversight over me,� he told the UO community. �There has to be oversight over police.�
Carmichael took over the department at UC Davis when former Chief Annette Spicuzza was ousted after a national policing embarrassment.
In November 2011, at the height of the occupy protests nationally, a line of students locked arms and blocked a road on campus. Lt. John Pike took a can of pepper spray, walked along the line of seated students, shooting the spray into their faces � creating an image that dominated the news and then lived on as an Internet meme, �Casually Pepper Spray Everything Cop,� in which users Photoshopped Pike and the spray into paintings, iconic photographs and movie stills.
On that day, Carmichael was posted 25 miles away at the university�s hospital and research center.
But he was at the helm of the department when the dust settled, and he had to decide what punishment Pike would face. A panel recommended demotion or suspension, but Carmichael, instead, sent him packing.
The chief was so willing to lend the UC Davis community his ear that he posted his cellphone number on the department�s website.
As word spread this week that Carmichael would leave UC Davis, the campus responded with dismay. The chancellor said he was �extremely sorry� to see the chief go.
Carmichael, 51, replaces former UO Chief Carolyn McDermed, who retired under pressure in February after a lawsuit that exposed questionable management practices at the department.
He starts at UO on Sept. 12. �The first thing I really need to do is learn and listen and understand from UO, what does UO need?� he said.
Carmichael will oversee a department with half as many sworn officers and half the budget that he commanded at UC Davis.
Carmichael is taking a pay cut. His annual starting salary as chief at UC Davis was $164,000; at the UO he�ll earn $160,000 to start. Carmichael has two children in college; he�ll supplement his UO salary with CalPERS retirement pay, he said.
�It�s not about the pay. Being able to retire give me the opportunity to be at the UO. For me, the UO is absolutely a step up.�
The UOPD will be only his third department in 30 years of policing.
He spent half at the Pinole, Calif., city police department and half at UC Davis.
Police are us
Carmichael has a fire in his belly about community policing, and he doesn�t mean the kind that exists solely as a slogan on a police car door.
�Engagement means all of us,� he said. �It doesn�t mean people that like us. We have to find ways in our community to reach out to members of our community who do not feel served by us.�
At UC Davis, Carmichael launched a Wednesday evening �Student Advisory to the Chief� board. He did it at night, interim UC Davis Chief Jennifer Garcia said, because �students don�t get up in the morning.�
Talks ran the gamut from policy to police brutality.
Carmichael integrated students in the police department by giving 130 of them jobs as Aggie Host security officers, who conduct patrols and drive Safe Rides vans.
�To sum up this entire program, it�s students serving students,� the chief said in a news story.
He worked with students on three forums entitled �Realism and Racism,� �Police Conduct and Police Misconduct,� and �Problems, Processes, and Procedures.�
Campus officers attended and listened to students, some of whom came from tough neighborhoods where police had a bad name.
To be trusted, the police department needed officers that reflect the community, he said. Carmichael�s goal was to assemble a department � and a profession � made up of highly educated, highly diverse and bright individuals, he said.
He created a Cadet Academy for UC Davis seniors, which teaches officer requirements, such as fitness, penal code and police procedures. The academy tapped bilingual and trilingual students from a wide swath of communities.
Many students became police officers, and they�ve joined departments throughout the state, Carmichael said. The UC Davis department has hired seven, he said.
Last month, Carmichael hosted a campus Pok�mon adventure when it became clear that engrossed players could be at risk.
�Instead of me sending out a flier to say, �Hey, be safe,� we said, �What a great way to meet our community.� �
At least 200 people turned up, he said. They heard the chief�s safety tips, ate pizza and swapped stories.
�I�m level 15, by the way,� Carmichael said.
The UC Davis campus paper, The Aggie, opined: �We continue to applaud Chief Carmichael for his efforts to mend the strained relationship between the police and the students??...??�
Carmichael said he means to knit the UO community together in similar ways.
�I speak from the heart,� he said. �We�re going to be a community-based organization that everyone on our campus feels served by.�
10-foot rule
Carmichael asks a lot of his officers. He requires them to follow the 10-foot rule, which means that when they are within that perimeter with anybody on campus, they should greet them.
It�s an idea he snagged from The Ritz-Carlton.
�We�re going to endear ourselves to everyone we meet,� he said. �As police officers, the worst thing we can do is put on sunglasses and walk by people without saying hello.�
Some officers were skeptical of Carmichael�s ideas.
�At first there was some hesitation because of the new units being created, and change is always uncomfortable for some,� said Garcia, the interim chief at UC Davis. �Some people embraced it. Some didn�t. But as the programs evolved, the ones that pushed back changed their minds.�
Carmichael allowed that he has some faults and made some mistakes, which hopefully will �make me a better chief in Oregon.�
For instance, before he became police chief, he wasn�t a very good listener � �My wife would agree 100 percent,� he said. �I�ve refined that. I talk a lot; but I promise you, I do have the ability to listen.�
Now, Carmichael says he�s ready to join TrackTown USA, including an effort to moderate his intake of pizza.
�I�m going to make sure I walk the walk,� he said. �My officers need the example of a fit chief. I�ve been bad at that. I�ve let it go a little bit.�
Carmichael said that his wife, Angelica, and their daughter, 13, and son, 11, are �dying� to get to Eugene.
Despite his long run in California, he said he�s not built to live in temperatures surpassing 90 or 106 degrees. �I was built for 70 degrees and cloudy,� he said. �We�ll be the crazy people dancing in the rain when it rains.�

Squamish, B.C. Bigfoot video from back in May made headlines in and around the Bigfoot community and now a new video from the area. A group hiking at the top of Panorama Ridge near the Black Tusk Mountain captured a figure that is believed to be a Sasquatch or Bigfoot. They didn't think the figure could of been human because of the amount of rugged land it was covering moving downside of the glacier and the way it was moving.
They estimated the distance of the footage to be approx 2k miles away and the figures seems to be quite sizable. The video is said to have been shot with a iPhone 5 and zoomed in to its maximum. The figure does seem to be moving rather quickly for the type of land that is and at that kind of distance does seem rather large.
Here is the new Squamish , British Colombia Bigfoot video for you to view and you can decide for yourself if this could possibly be a Bigfoot or perhaps just a human making its way downside of that glacier. *** There is some explicit language in the video***

Jenna Morrison was 38 years with a five-year-old son and another child on the way when she was struck and killed by a truck while riding her bicycle one fall day in 2011. The incident at the corner of Sterling Road and Dundas Street West galvanized Toronto's cycling community. Throngs of cyclists joined a memorial ride through the streets of the city to mark the tragedy and call for better safety measures. They left a "ghost bike," painted all in white, at the place where Ms. Morrison was killed.
Cyclists have become a well-organized, outspoken and influential lobby in recent years. They fight for more bike lanes, more bike parking and safer streets. They make authorities wake up and take action. Pedestrians are not nearly as forceful. It is time they found their voice.
The number of people who are killed or injured by cars while walking city streets is shocking. Last year was the deadliest for pedestrians since 2003, with 43 killed, according to police figures. In one 24-hour period alone, 24 were hit by cars. Two-thirds of those who died last year were over 65 years old. This year up to Aug. 25, 17 have been killed, police say.
Story continues below advertisement
As The Globe's Oliver Moore reported in June last year after investigating pedestrian deaths, "A total of 163 pedestrians, more people than can fit in a streetcar, have been killed since 2011. It's a toll that surpasses fatal shootings, yet generates a small fraction of the community concern and political reaction."
When someone is hit and killed by a car, we treat is as a routine matter, marked by a cursory report in the media. Last year's Year of the Car received nowhere near the attention of the Summer of the Gun in 2005, a year that saw 52 gun homicides.
One reason may be that pedestrians don't speak up. Cyclists have come to see themselves as a kind of tribe, acutely aware of their rights and ready to fight for them. They demand their place on the road. They make a big noise when something happens to one of their own.
Pedestrians don't see themselves the same way at all. They have no sense of solidarity. A fellow pedestrian is simply another person walking. You will often see a bike that bears a sticker demanding more bike lanes or warning drivers to share the road. You will never see a pedestrian with a T-shirt demanding the right to walk in safety. Pedestrians need to find their feet and fight for their lives.
Some, to their credit, are starting to organize. The Walk Toronto group, which meets monthly, campaigns for things such as reduced speed limits, better school safety zones, more safety cameras and more sidewalks on roads that lack them. Friends and Families for Safe Streets, founded by Walk Toronto, Cycle Toronto and other groups, lobbies governments and holds monthly vigils at City Hall. "Our members," it says, "are survivors of traffic collisions and friends and families whose loved ones have been killed or severely injured by careless drivers and dangerous conditions on Toronto's streets."
Belatedly, governments are starting to listen. Mayor John Tory has made cutting pedestrian deaths a priority. The city is increasing the number of red-light cameras and revamping hot-spot intersections to make them safer. City council has approved a plan that aims to cut road deaths and serious injuries to zero within five years. But there is much that pedestrian advocates could still do if they were more organized and more militant. They could start by fighting the pernicious myth that pedestrians themselves are to blame when they get hurt. Many drivers will tell you that distracted pedestrians who stare at their phones as they walk are a menace – and they can be. But, as The Globe's Mr. Moore found, the available research shows that use of electronic devices by pedestrians played a role in only a tiny percentage of fatalities. Distracted drivers, high speeds and poorly designed roads pose far more danger. Many pedestrians are hit when crossing broad arterial roads made for fast-moving cars, not people in foot.
It won't do to blame the victim. When the contest is between a hurtling heap of metal and a fragile human being, it is clear where the responsibility lies. That is just one of the arguments that pedestrians could make if, like the empowered loudmouths on bikes, they learned to stand up for themselves.
The VR company responsible for many of the format's early experiments in broadcasting has set its sights on live music. NextVR, which has previously streamed boxing matches, a Democratic debate, and the Daytona 500, has partnered with events company Live Nation to "broadcast hundreds of live, cutting-edge performances in virtual reality to music fans worldwide." The company is not alone in this ambition either, with UMG and iHeartRadio announcing plans earlier this year to bring VR to some concerts.
The first show will be this summer
There are no details yet on which musical acts you'll be able to see via NextVR, but the company promises a "regular supply of world-class live music shows." As with NextVR's previous broadcasts, these will be available via Samsung's Gear VR via the Oculus Home app, with other platforms coming soon. The company says the first of its musical VR events will take place this summer, with a full schedule for the following year to come. NextVR has previously partnered with Coldplay to produce a small demo clip for its app, but this is major step up for the company.
The plan, says NextVR, is to use music to attract new VR viewers. The company has previously taken a similar approach with sporting fans, signing a five-year deal with Fox Sports which the parties claimed was the first of its kind. That deal was only made this year, though, and it's presumably too soon to tell whether or not it has yet borne fruit.
By partnering with Live Nation, though, NextVR seems like it has given itself a lot of choices, musically speaking. Live Nation's upcoming events include everything from Riverdance and Bryan Adams, to Rihanna and Beyoncé. If NextVR can get on stage with headline acts like those, then it'll certainly get a few more people dragging on their VR headsets.
For only the fourth time in history, there will be a new $100 bill.
After a three-year delay due to slower-than-expected production, Americans will finally have an improved, high-tech $100 bill for their wallets, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
The bill is set to debut on Oct. 8.
What's so special about the new greenback? To start, the Fed says the the bill is a culmination of a decade-long research and design process.

The note features a series of amped-up security measures aimed at combating counterfeiters, including a blue, 3-D security ribbon on the front of the bill that moves when the note is tilted back and forth and side to side.
The inkwell and bell on the front of the bill and the number 100 on the right-hand corner also change from copper to green when the note is tilted.
Poll: What do you think of the new $100?
This is the fourth time the $100 bill has been redesigned, according to a Fed spokeswoman. It has been revamped three times in the last 20 years alone, as the Fed had to react more often to improved counterfeiting technology.
The design was first unveiled in 2010 and was meant to go into circulation in Feb. 2011.
The Succession to the Crown Act of 2013 finally came into force on 26 March 2015. This means that a girl born into the British royal family is no longer overtaken in the line of succession by a younger brother. It also changes some other things; Royals can now marry Catholics without losing their place in the line of succession and only the first six people in line have to ask for permission to marry. From the time of the Act of Settlement 1701 (which settled the succession upon Sophia of Hanover), only two women were overtaken by a younger brother who later became king.These two are Princess Augusta of Great Britain, whose younger brother became George III and Victoria, Princess Royal, whose younger brother became Edward VII.
Princess Augusta of Great Britain was born on 13 July 1737 as the eldest child of Frederick, Prince of Wales and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha. She was overtaken in the line of succession by the birth of the future George III on 4 June 1738. She married on 16 January 1764 to Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. They had seven children of which two were considered ‘invalids' though I'm not sure if they mean a mental or physical disability and one child lived for only six months. Her daughter, Caroline of Brunswick, became the jilted Queen of George IV and the mother of Princess Charlotte of Wales who tragically died in childbirth and is another Queen we've never had. Her marriage was rather unhappy, and she preferred to spend her time in England. She died there in 1813.
Victoria, Princess Royal was born on 21 November 1840 as the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. She was overtaken in the line of succession by her younger brother, the future Edward VII, on 9 November 1841. She married the future German Emperor, Frederick III on 25 January 1858. It was a happy marriage that produced many children. By the time her husband became emperor in 1888, he was already dying of throat cancer. He was emperor for just 99 days. She never got along with her eldest son, the new emperor. By 1899 Victoria was diagnosed with breast cancer that later spread to her spine and she finally died on 5 August 1901.
Although we'll never know what kind of Queen they would have been, I'm glad this Act is finally in place. I think the next task should be doing the same for the nobility in the United Kingdom, but that is a whole other discussion!

— The economic trouble that is causing so many headaches is affecting business at the newly opened Raleigh Convention Center, which isn't seeing as many visitors as officials want.
Laurie Okun, director of convention sales, says that so far this year, one group has canceled, another decided to move to a different venue because it is cheaper and two other groups rescheduled.
"The biggest thing that concerns me is not the cancellations; it's the lower numbers of people that could be traveling, especially state travel."
Gov. Bev Perdue recently told all state agencies to cut spending by 7 percent, which could lead to cuts in travel and training spending.
The same policy, Okun fears, will be repeated and will have an impact on how many people will be at conventions this year.
"That's life, that's how I look at it," Okun said. "If anyone thought about opening this building with no snags, they probably shouldn't have this job."
Government events aren't the only ones that could be affected.
The National Agents Alliance, an insurance marketing group, is holding its second event at the center this month. The event is expected to draw about 2,000 people, but organizers were hoping for more.
"We expected to have up to 25 percent, and we had up to, maybe, 8 percent," said Andy Albright, the organization's director.
The $221 million Raleigh Convention Center, which opened in September after nine years of planning and construction, is 500,000 square feet. It has 19 meeting rooms, a grand ballroom and a four-star, 400 room Marriott hotels next door.
The city's investment was $41 million over budget, but city leaders have said they expect it to give a major boost to downtown Raleigh's rebirth.
Note: I DID NOT MAKE THIS. It is a translated project from German.
Like Desert Nightmare , this was originally created by Kelven. I've had permission from him to translate.Schuld (Guilty) is a surreal, psychological horror created by Kelven. The game was a submission for a Ten Words Contest. All text is fully translated, except for the title of the game itself. All the graphics of the game are also custom.Schuld is about a man who finds himself in a dying world, without knowing how he got there and why he is there. The game itself is very linear and the puzzles are not especially complex. If a walkthrough is necessary, there is one (in German) included in the game folder. However, it clearly spoils the entire plot, so be warned.The game is relatively short (as it was probably made under contest time constraints) and clocks in at about 1-2 hours, probably less. The game is not quite as incredibly polished as Desert Nightmare and is much more of a psychological horror. I've attempted to make sure none of the screenshots have any spoilers.Enjoy!Original game: http://www.rpg-atelier.de/index.php?site=showgame&gid=796
For Reno car salesman Tim Ticknor, the squeeze on his middle-class existence gradually has turned into a chokehold.
In 2005, he was making more than $90,000 a year selling used cars to people who had moved to the Southwest for its booming economy. It was an income that allowed him to rent a townhouse with his wife and daughter in a gated community.
Over the next six years, as the economy slowed, so did his income. First, it dropped to $70,000, then after a time it fell to $30,000.
By Scott Sady, for USA TODAY The car dealership where Ticknor last worked, making $90,000 a year, is bankrupt, and he is hustling as a day laborer for a temp agency.
Today, the car dealership where Ticknor last worked is bankrupt, and he is hustling as a day laborer for a temp agency. He and his family had to move into his mother-in-law's mobile home because they couldn't afford to pay rent.
Income breakdown The top fifth of households collected half of U.S. income in 2010. Share of U.S. household income, 2010: Note: Percentages do not add to 100 due to rounding Sources: Census Bureau, American Community Survey
Ticknor's story reflects how, across the nation, the middle class' share of the nation's income is shrinking. Reno, which has among the highest rates of unemployment and foreclosures in the United States, is a stark example: The share of income in the metro area that was collected by the middle class fell from 49.8% in 2006 to 45.8% in 2010, the year after the 18-month recession ended.
A USA TODAY analysis of Census data found the Reno area was among 150 nationwide where the share of income going to the middle class — generally made up of households that make $20,700 to $99,900 a year — shrank from 2006 to 2010. Metro areas where the middle class' share of income dropped outnumbered those where it grew by more than 2-to-1.
"The lower share of income is a way of saying income inequality is growing in the middle," says Paul Taylor, executive vice president of the Pew Research Center, who has studied the shift. "The vast middle has less of the pie than it had before."
Income is shifting to the top tier of households, especially those in the top 5%, Taylor says. The top 5% earn more than $181,000 annually.
In 2010, the top one-fifth of U.S. households collected 50.3% of all the nation's income, up from 49.9% in 2006. The lowest-earning one-fifth of households collected just 3.3% of the nation's income, down from 3.4% in 2006.
That leaves the three-fifths of households in between — a common definition of a broad middle class. It collected 46.3% of the income last year, down from 46.7% in 2006.
Analysts call it the middle-class squeeze.
The data are the latest signs of a trend that dates to the 1970s, says Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. Back then, 53% of the nation's income went to the middle class.
She says that during the 2000s, households in the middle class began losing ground because their incomes were not growing. The recent recession made it worse as employers cut work hours, furloughed workers, froze salaries or imposed layoffs. At the same time, the value of family assets, such as homes, went down.
"Families are taking substantial losses," Shierholz says. "The really scary thing is, there's no relief in sight."
A 'humbling' experience
In Reno, a metropolitan area of 425,000 people, unemployment jumped from 4% in 2006 to 14% last year. Adjusted for inflation, the median income dropped 10% in the same period, to $50,699.
Rows of for-sale signs in every neighborhood and empty storefronts tell the story of a city whose middle class has been hit hard.
Ticknor, 45, says he is one of those casualties.
Six years ago, he was a car salesman, earning close to a six-figure salary that allowed him to afford a two-story condo in a private community. He drove an off-white Dodge Charger with heated leather seats. And his baby girl, Ashlee, "never wanted for anything."
As the recession took hold, fewer people bought cars, and Ticknor felt it in his wallet.
At first, he and his wife cut back on restaurants and movies. As their financial squeeze got tighter, Ticknor and his family moved out of the townhouse in 2008 because they couldn't afford the $1,200 monthly rent. They lived with a relative for a while and last year moved into an $800-a-month duplex.
Then this year, after the car dealership he worked for went bankrupt and he lost his job, they had to leave that apartment and move into his mother-in-law's single-wide trailer.
Along the way, they have sold off their possessions. Today, the sports car is gone; so is much of their furniture. They sold their Apple computer recently for $150.
Ticknor checks in every day at 5:30 a.m. with a temp agency. "You hope they have a job for you," he says. He has worked for minimum wage as a receptionist, cashier and manual laborer.
"The biggest word is humbling," he says. "It does a mental thing on you. I used to make big money. I was like a big shot. …You take it for granted."
In Reno's downtown, bookstore owner Christine Kelly, 49, sees firsthand what the loss of income has meant for the middle class. She says sales are down at least 25% compared with what they were before the recession.
"Those are numbers we'll probably never see again," she says.
She moved her store, Sundance Books and Music, downtown this year because the strip mall where they had been been largely empty.
"There were no other businesses around us," she says. She hasn't given raises in several years, but she has been able to keep all eight of her employees, some of whom have been with her for more than a decade. It's a source of pride for her, but it's meant her own income has gone down. She says she spends less, and when she does buy something she pays cash.
If the economy picked up, the first thing she'd do is give raises.
"And buy myself a new a pair of jeans," she says.
Middle-income jobs fall
New Bern, N.C., couldn't be more different from the gambling hub and neon lights of Reno.
Yet like Reno, New Bern — a community tucked into the Neuse River in the center of the state's coastline — saw one of the biggest shifts in the middle class' share of income during the recession of any area with a population of more than 20,000.
The middle class in New Bern collected 51.6% of the income in 2006. In 2010, the share went down to 43.9 %.
"The bulk of our middle class are retirees who came from New York or New Jersey, and they retired on fixed incomes and investments," says Mayor Lee Wilson Bettis.
Those investments have suffered because of the volatile stock market, and many of those retirees have had to go back to work, he says.
At the same time, the area's job base, made up in part of manufacturing and trucking, has also been hurt, he says. Large companies such as Hatteras Yachts, which makes luxury boats, and BSH Home Appliances, which makes high-end appliances, have cut hundreds of jobs.
The number of manufacturing jobs in Craven County, where New Bern is located, fell 36% from 2007 to 2010, says James Kleckley, director of the Bureau of Business Research at East Carolina University. By comparison, manufacturing jobs in the state fell by 20% during that time.
"You look at those jobs and most are middle-class jobs," Kleckley says.
Stacy Kendall, 46, found a roommate after she lost her job at a senior citizens center last year. Even though she found another job six months later, she says, the expense of paying for an apartment was too much to keep up with.
So now she shares a house with a mom and her two daughters.
"A lot more people are sharing homes," she says.
She started a support group last year for the unemployed and underemployed. One of those who attends is Russ Whittaker, 49.
He says he, his wife and three children were comfortably middle class. They moved to New Bern in 2005 from Cape Cod, Mass. Their old house sold at a profit, allowing them to pay cash for their $300,000 house. Without the expense of a mortgage, his wife could retire as a teacher; they paid off their car loans and sent their children to private school.
Then last year, Whittaker lost his $46,100-a-year job working as a researcher for the First Church of Christ, Scientist.
"We were looking pretty good," he says. "I had a nice Northern salary in a Southern economy, and without it, it's been hard."
Now, instead of one job, he works five part-time jobs, earning anywhere from a minimum wage of $7.25 to $10 an hour. His wife is working again, too, providing day care for children and working in their church.
Together, they earn about $1,800 a month, Whittaker says.
Their children are still in private school, for now, with help from his father, savings and financial aid from the school.
But the Whittakers have changed their habits. They now shop at the dollar store, where they can buy a name-brand loaf of bread for one-half or one-third of its price at a supermarket.
They used to pay for their children, ages 8, 11 and 14, to take gymnastics classes. Now the children take part in free activities, such as basketball, volleyball and baseball leagues.
They've cut their cable service to only basic channels.
"We are getting by, and we have everything we need," he says. "But it's not what we had before. We've gotten a crash course in the difference between wants and needs."
'Juggling everything I can'
Even in communities that have not seen massive income shifts, the middle class is feeling the squeeze.
In Napa, Calif., known for its fertile valleys, wineries and luxury tourism, Victoria Froelicher frets. The divorced mom has a career as a creative-services supervisor for an agricultural company, making $80,000 a year.
That puts her squarely in the middle class in Napa, where middle-class households earn $26,000 to $121,000.
But Froelicher, 53, finds it more and more difficult to make ends meet. She says she owes about 30% more on her home than it is worth, she has to pay to put her daughter through college, and she cares for her elderly mother.
She pays $2,300 a month on a three-bedroom house she bought in 2007 for $420,000, but is now worth about $285,000.
She also pays $400 a month on a loan she and her daughter took out to help pay for the $17,000-a-year college tuition and room and board.
To bring more money in, she cut her 401(k) contribution from 8% to 1%.
"I'm juggling everything I can," Froelicher says. "I don't feel I am middle-class. I feel I am lower-middle-class and teetering on poor. If I lost my job, I could see how I could end up homeless."
Froelicher is like a majority of Americans who say they haven't moved forward or have fallen backward in the past five years, says Paul Taylor of Pew Research.
A Pew study of the middle class in 2008 found 56% of Americans felt they either fell behind or haven't progressed, the most downbeat short-term assessment of personal progress in nearly half a century of polling by the center.
In Napa, the median income has gone from $72,136 in 2006 to $64,401 in 2010 when adjusted for inflation. Median housing values have plummeted from $657,300 in 2006 to $424,100 in 2010.
Froelicher rattles off a list of how she makes do: no smartphones, flat screens or Netflix subscriptions. She brings leftovers for lunch, shops at consignment stores when she needs something and refinanced her used-car loan from 4.35% to 2.99%.
"Food costs so much more, and medical, dental and glasses, and everyday expenses," she says.
She's learning to do house repairs herself, using how-to instructions on the Internet. And the molar she cracked that needs a new crown? She says she's flossing and keeping the tooth clean until January when her dental benefits from work kick in again. She used the maximum coverage allowed this year for a root canal.
Froelicher says she always thought by the time she reached her 50s she would be living a comfortable middle-class life and have enough savings for retirement.
"But instead, it seems I have less and less all the time," she says. "There is no safety net or security in my life."
It is ten years since Robin Cook died and somehow the hole left by his departure only seems to have grown bigger with time. Looking back on a decade of almost continuous crisis and decline for Labour, it is hard to think of a moment when the party would not have benefited from his presence. Ed Miliband would certainly have benefitted from his wisdom and support during five years in which Labour's surviving grandees offered very little of either. Perhaps his most important contribution would have been in Scotland where he would have relished the opportunity to make the radical case against separatism and provided a living rebuttal of the SNP's “Red Tory” attack line that did Labour so much damage at the general election. He was the missing link needed to reconcile Labour with its disenchanted former supporters.
Cook is still missed because he represented something that now seems to be lacking on the British left. The substance of this is the topic of a new book, Robin Cook: Principles and Power, written by his former media handler, John Williams. It tells the story of Cook's time as Foreign Secretary and his struggle, as Williams summarises it, “to reconcile principles with the democratic necessity to compromise”. It records, in particular, his determination to integrate an ethical dimension into British foreign policy at a time when the realities of international diplomacy and the constraints of collective cabinet responsibility presented significant obstacles.
Williams provides valuable insight into the inner workings of government and the relationship between its key personnel. But the book's real value is that it relates an important and previously untold part of the New Labour story that helps to shed light on how the party got to where it is now. Cook regarded himself as a moderniser by instinct, yet he was always clear that the goal of modernisation should be to make progressive politics work. While crediting New Labour with genuine achievements, especially in its first term, he felt that the party had sacrificed too much of its purpose in the quest for office. His willingness to press the issue became a recurring point of tension in relations with Tony Blair and other senior colleagues.
In the end the Blair government became too narrow and too contemptuous of progressive concerns to accommodate Cook's brand of politics and he ended up resigning on an issue of principle over Iraq. While his standing was enhanced by the split, New Labour was irreparably damaged by it as its reputation for cynicism became embedded and the broad electoral coalition that delivered two landslides started to crumble. The aftershocks are still being felt now in the collapse of Labour in Scotland and the failure of Blairite candidates in two successive leadership contests. There will be more to come if and when the Chilcot enquiry finally reports.
Despite the plaudits he received at the time, it is important to record that Cook regarded his resignation as a personal failure. Although he rejected the idea that power should ever be an end in itself, he had little time for the argument that good intentions are all that count. The true conviction politician should never embrace opposition as a way of life because, just like the unprincipled politics of triangulation, it means giving up on the possibility of change. Radicalism requires a strategy for power. This matters today because Labour has emerged from an era in which the balance was often tipped too far in one direction and is now in danger of tipping it too far in the other.
The undoubted advantage of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is that it draws a firm line under the New Labour years and forces the party to think afresh about what it really stands for. Ed Miliband tried valiantly to achieve a similar reset, but his style was so diffident that only those threatened by it really noticed. Now that Labour is compelled to address some fundamental questions, it has a chance to move on, provided it comes up sensible answers. The problem is that Corbyn and his supporters have yet to give a plausible account of how they intend to build an electoral majority behind policies that have always been rejected by voters in the past. They too need to understand the democratic necessity to compromise, both with their internal Labour critics and with the country as a whole.
The most difficult challenge for those opposed to Corbyn's approach is to be honest in accepting their own share of responsibility for his rise. It is easy to rail against the “politics of illusion”, but that is what you get when the politics of disillusion have run its course. There is no future in a bloodless technocratic centrism that ignores the country's biggest social and economic problems in the name of “realism”. That much we know. The big question is whether Labour moderates can learn from their failure.
The evidence of Peter Mandelson's recent leaked memo, in which he bemoaned “the last five years' of intellectual sterility”, is not encouraging. A frank assessment of where Labour went wrong would admit that its period of intellectual sterility began twenty years ago, under him. Telling Corbyn that he is wrong because he can't win simply confirms the impression that nothing has really changed. Labour's recovery can't start with a brute assertion of electoral logic. It has to start with a principled debate about the best way to achieve its goal of a stronger and fairer society. If it goes back to believing that winning elections is all that matters, it will fail even on this narrow measure of success. A hollowed out Labour Party with a minimalist offer cannot secure the broad support needed to govern.
Corbyn's campaign only achieved lift-off because the Labour leadership contest seemed to be in danger of becoming a mindless stampede to the right. The mainstream candidates spent its opening days trying to outbid each other in the number of progressive commitments they proposed to dump – the mansion tax, the 50p higher rate, responsible capitalism – as if Labour could hope to win in 2020 by standing for less rather than more. They did this reflexively, in the erroneous belief that Labour lost because it was too radical. It was only after Corbyn had become the shock frontrunner that any of them sounded like they wanted to lead a party of the left. It's hardly surprising that Labour's membership didn't buy it.
Many now expect Labour to descend into civil war, as early skirmishes over defence and fiscal policy would seem to confirm. But there is another scenario in which its different wings attempt to reach an historic compromise that allows them to marry principles with power in the way that Robin Cook envisaged. Corbyn and his supporters would learn to embrace compromise as a principled democratic choice while party moderates would move beyond narrow electoralism and attempt to recapture a genuine sense of idealistic purpose. Cook would have been a good rallying point for a project of that kind. Labour's prospects over the next five years – perhaps its very survival – now depend on its ability to find a new progressive consensus without him.
Strong winds continue to churn up big waves on Lake Michigan -- and Chicagoans are urged to stay away from the shore.
Track the Storm with Doppler Radar

The Coast Guard urged people to stay off the rocky terrain, beaches, piers and paths, even if they appear safe, and swimmers and surfers should remain out of the water. Not everyone heeded that warning.
"It's very easy with the slick rocks to fall into the water," said Petty Officer Joshua Posen, Coast Guard.
The lakefront path remains closed as the effects of Superstorm Sandy are felt along Lake Michigan. Some waves were as high as 20-feet, and they crashed into the lakefront trail. A large part of the lakefront bike path was closed, but some adventurous cyclists and runners still tried to get through.
"It's going to be great on the way home, I'm telling ya. We're going to fly on the way back," Jacob Furst said.
"I just wanted to see what the waves were like. We heard they were going to be so big, I just wanted to run down and see," Marlene Key-Patterson said.
For a second consecutive day, surfers at 57th Street Beach were among those ignoring the warnings.
"It can be dangerous obviously. It's water. It's cold, it's big, you can drown, but if you're used to it and you do it a lot. We're all excellent swimmers, we wear the right kind of wetsuits so we don't get hypothermic or anything," said Matt Cruger, surfer.
The lakefront also drew photographers.
"I like this view. It's something unusual for my camera," Vladimir Rabenovich said.
A high wind warning and flood warning for Lake Michigan remain in effect for parts of the Chicago area through Wednesday 4 p.m. However, a wind advisory for the Chicago lakefront has been canceled.
Many world leaders may think that their paths to power were written in the stars, though some born under certain constellations always stood a better chance of wielding influence when they grew up.
Analysis of more than 190 world leaders shows that those with certain zodiac signs may be more likely to lead their countries, according to Vocativ.
Scorpios, born in late October through late November, have the most heads of government, with 22, or more than 11 per cent of those heading up cabinets throughout the world.
Scorpio was the most common zodiac sign for world leaders. Above, a Vocativ graphic shows where those born under the constellation rule, including Australia and a number of countries in Africa
Prominent Scorpios, who are known for being independent but unyielding, include Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) and American presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (left)
Other powerful Scorpios, who are known for being independent but ambitious unyielding, including presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Scorpios are followed by 18 Sagitarrius leaders and 18 Leos including President Barack Obama, who like Bill Clinton was born in August.
Powerful Sagitarrius have included wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, Josef Stalin and Pope Francis, and those born under the sign are said to be philosophical and optimistic.
Leos world leaders have included President Barack Obama and former president Bill Clinton. Above, a Vocativ graphic shows where they currently occupy 18 positions as heads of government
Sagittarius around the world include Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and Pope Francis. Above, aVocativ graphic shows that those born in November and December run the governments of Poland and Denmark
Gemini saw the fourth most heads of government with 17, followed by Cancer with 16.
Former George W Bush, a Cancer, shares his sign with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Aries, which is said to be enthusiastic, and Pisces, thought of as an idealistic sign, made up the middle of the pack, with 15 world leaders each, according to Dadaviz.
Late winter signs Aquarius and Capricorn each had 14 world leaders, despite previously boasting presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Scorpio is the most common zodiac sign for world leaders, despite the fact that no member of a G7 country has it. Above, (left to right) European Council President Donald Tusk (Taurus), Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (Virgo) Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper (Taurus), Barack Obama (Leo), German Chancellor Angela Merkel (Cancer), French President Francois Hollande (Leo), David Cameron (Libra) Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (Capricorn) and the European Commission's Jean-Claude Juncker (Sagitarrius)
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, (left) and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, (right) both Virgos, have risen to become heads of government despite their star signs
Prominent Taurus have included such diverse figures as the Queen, Pope John Paul II, Saddam Hussein, Tony Blair and Adolf Hitler.
However, the sign came second from last in the ranking of current world leaders with 13.
It shared 10th place with 13 Libras, who are described as balanced and include UK Prime Minister David Cameron, born October 9, who shares a sign with former PM Margaret Thatcher.
Virgo, a sign known for being reflective and analytical, had the fewest government leaders with 12, including Indian Prime Minster Narenda Modi and Russian premier Dmitry Medvedev.
Dadaviz's tally of world leaders' zodiac signs focused on heads of government rather than heads of state, meaning some powerful figures such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, a Libra, were not included.
(WSCR) Chicago Bears wide receiver/return specialist Devin Hester has sold his home in Gurnee, Il. for $322,500.
The five-bedroom, 3,100-square-foot home was one of Hester's three in the Chicago area, the Tribune reports.
After the season, when the Bears fired head coach Lovie Smith, Hester threatened to retire from the league.
“I don't even know if I want to play again,” Hester said. “That's been something on my mind for two years. It's not (much fun for me anymore). I've got my workers comp papers in my pocket. We'll see how I feel. I'm going to go home and talk to my wife and talk to my family and see where we go from there. I got two beautiful kids, man, two boys. A lot of stress has been on my mind lately.”
There's no word yet if the sale had anything to do with his recent comments.
There has, said Mr Mughal, been “a wave of attacks, harassment, and hate-filled speech against Muslims … an unprecedented number of incidents”, including “a rise in street harassment of Muslims – unprovoked, opportunistic attacks from strangers as Muslims go about their lives”.
He added: “Over the past week or so, these sorts of hate crimes have noticeably increased in number and, in many instances, become more extreme.
"The scale of the backlash is astounding … there has been a massive spike in anti-Muslim prejudice. A sense of endemic fear has gripped Muslim communities.”
The media, especially the BBC, have accepted the claims without question. A presenter on Radio 4's influential Today programme stated that attacks on Muslims were now “on a very serious scale”.
Talk of a “massive anti-Muslim backlash” has become routine. And it is that figure issued by Tell Mama – of, to date, 212 “anti-Muslim incidents” since the Woolwich murder – which has formed the basis of nearly all this reporting.
Mr Mughal is in no doubt what lies behind it all. As he told a newspaper: “I do not see an end to this cycle of violence. There is an underlying Islamophobia in our society and the horrendous events in Woolwich have brought this to the fore.”
And as he put it on Today, “the [Government's] Prevent [anti-extremism] agenda, the extremist agenda, have not been good for building confidence – the sense of fear just alienates and isolates communities.”
Yet the unending “cycle of violence” against Muslims, the unprecedented “wave of attacks” against them from strangers in the street, the “underlying Islamophobia in our society” – all turn out to be yet more things we thought we knew about Woolwich that are not really supported by the evidence.
Tell Mama confirmed to The Sunday Telegraph that about 120 of its 212 “anti-Muslim incidents” – 57 per cent – took place only online. They were offensive postings on Twitter or Facebook, or comments on blogs: nasty and undesirable, certainly, but some way from violence or physical harm and often, indeed, legal. Not all the offending tweets and postings, it turns out, even originated in Britain.
Tell Mama has no written definition of what it classes as an anti-Muslim incident, but has in the past adopted a wide definition. Last November, the cross-bench Asian peer, Baroness Flather, told a newspaper it was “pointless for the Conservatives to chase Muslim votes.
They are all on benefits and all vote Labour”. Tell Mama added this admittedly crass and untrue remark to its database as an “anti-Muslim incident,” though it said it had deleted it following an explanation from Lady Flather.
Although the service says its caseworkers “carefully handle each report as it comes in, to determine whether it can be verified and justified as an anti-Muslim incident”, Mr Mughal admitted that a further 35 of the 212 post-Woolwich incidents, or 16 per cent, had yet to be verified.
He justified publishing the figure, however, saying he expected that all but a handful of incidents would be verified.
Fewer than one in 12 of the 212 “incidents” reported to Tell Mama since Woolwich – 17 cases (8 per cent) – involved individuals being physically targeted.
Six people had things thrown at them, said Mr Mughal, and most of the other 11 cases were attempts to pull off the hijab or other items of Islamic dress.
Without in any way denying the distress and harm caused by such attacks, they do stand at the lower levels of seriousness.
Seventeen is still likely, of course, to underestimate the total number of attacks. The Metropolitan Police, the only major force in Britain which breaks down “offences with an Islamophobic flag”, said there were 13 allegations of common or racially aggravated assault of Muslims reported to it in London in the week after the killing.
About 40 per cent of Britain's 2.7 million Muslims live in the capital, so the national figure could be around 32 cases, or about one Muslim in every 100,000.
Offences of common and racially aggravated assault are typically used where there has been no injury, such as hijab snatching, or minor injury not drawing blood or requiring medical treatment, such as the throwing incidents reported by Tell Mama. The Met said there were no cases reported to it where any more serious injury resulted.
Asking other police forces and trawling local media reports, The Telegraph has been unable to find a single confirmed case since Drummer Rigby's death where any individual Muslim has received an injury requiring medical treatment.
Tell Mama's Twitter feed reported one such incident, of a Muslim woman “knocked unconscious” in Bolton, but the local police said they had no knowledge of this and did not believe it happened.
It is unlikely, though not impossible, that any case of serious injury could have escaped the notice of the media or police.
Perhaps the most serious manifestation of anti-Muslim feeling after the killing was a number of attacks on mosques. These are believed to total 11, though here again evidence for a “wave of violence” is lacking.
With only two exceptions, a mosque in Grimsby into which firebombs were thrown and another one in Essex where a man entered with a knife, all the incidents were relatively minor, such as window-breaking or graffiti.
According to the Charity Commission, there are between 1,100 and 1,500 mosques in the UK, so the number attacked is less than 1 per cent.
Two other sets of figures are available. According to the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), forces nationally reported 71 anti-Muslim hate crimes or “incidents of note” to the National Community Tensions Team in the week after the murder of Drummer Rigby.
“That would cover everything they feel has a link to Woolwich, though an incident of note would not necessarily be a crime,” said a spokesman.
The second set of figures is from True Vision, an online hate-crime reporting tool operated by Acpo. There were 136 reports of anti-Muslim activity – internet or physical – received via this website in the week after Woolwich, overwhelmingly in the first few days, though Acpo said that not all were crimes and some reports were duplicates.
As for the claim that there is “no end” to the cycle of anti-Muslim activity, it has substantially ended already. According to police, there was a sharp spike in reported incidents in the day or so after the killing, but they have already subsided to pre-Woolwich levels. Acpo said that by last Wednesday, a week after the murder, the number of incidents reported to True Vision had fallen back to four a day.
The claim that the spike and numbers were “unprecedented” is wrong, too. After the 7/7 attacks in London – admittedly more serious than the killing of Drummer Rigby – there was a far bigger and more prolonged rise in faith-hate crimes. According to the Met, 269 were recorded in London alone in the three weeks after the 2005 attacks, compared with 40 for the same period the year before.
What the data broadly show, in short, is that Drummer Rigby's killers have failed. The breakdown in community relations has not come. There has been a rise in incidents, but it appears to be very short-term, overwhelmingly non-violent and even then almost entirely at the lower end of the scale.
Yet this is not a message the Islamophobia industry wants heard, now or ever. Two months before the Woolwich killing, Tell Mama was already claiming that anti-Muslim incidents were “rising”, on the basis of reports made to its service. But at that point it had only been going for a year, so it had no previous figures to compare.
In 2010 a report for the Islamist Cordoba Foundation, described by David Cameron as a “political front for the Muslim Brotherhood”, said there was already what it called a wave of “terrorism” against British Muslims, with an “alarming rise” in hatred of Islam.
What evidence there is simply does not support the claims. There is anti-Muslim hatred in Britain, and it is disgraceful. But nearly all the evidence shows it is diminishing. In 2009 there were 368 anti-Muslim crimes in London; in 2012, there were 337. In the first 11 weeks of 2013, there were 64 crimes, equating at that point to 303 across the year, though the Woolwich attack will drive that up.
Hate crime in London's main Muslim area, Tower Hamlets, has dropped by almost half since 2003 (though it rose slightly this year). Outside London, faith-hate crimes reported to the main forces with big Muslim populations – West Midlands, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire – have fallen, too.
Broader political developments suggest a country increasingly at ease with Muslims. In 2009 the main anti-Islamic party, the BNP, had 55 councillors. Now it has two. The number of Muslim MPs doubled at the last election, some elected for entirely non-Muslim seats such as Bromsgrove, Gillingham, or Stratford-upon-Avon with no backlash whatever.
Continental campaigns to ban minarets and the niqab have gained absolutely no political traction in Britain.
Opinion polls after the Woolwich attack showed rising positive sentiment about Muslims – though, as with so many of these exercises, the answers can depend on the questions you ask.
Yet broader politics are also driving the Islamophobia industry.
For Islamists such as the Cordoba Foundation, the narrative of British Muslims under attack, increasingly hated and feared by their fellow citizens, is essential for recruitment, and for furthering their central lie that different races and faiths cannot coexist.
“Islamophobic” is also a handy charge to throw at anyone who questions Islamist ideology.
Tell Mama is not Islamist, though Mr Mughal has written in the Cordoba Foundation's journal (he says it was a “mistake” which he will not repeat).
But part of its motivation appears to be an attempt to draw some of the sting from Islamist terrorism by equating it with the work of anti-Muslim extremist groups such as the English Defence League.
As Tell Mama's Twitter feed puts it, “whilst we need to tackle the narrative of hate inspired by al-Qaeda, we also need to tackle the thuggery and hate of the EDL”. Mr Mughal insists that “both groups are significantly problematic”.
Loathsome as the white extreme Right is, however, there is clearly no comparison. No one in Britain has been killed by the EDL; 53 people have been killed by Islamist terrorists. White racists, unlike their Islamist equivalents, do not control key religious institutions or have a significant presence in British universities.
Over the past decade, half a dozen or so white British Right-wingers have been convicted of possessing explosives and other weapons. But all were loners not acting in concert with any group.
In contrast, there have, over the same period, been 150 convictions for Islamist-related terrorism in the UK, many relating to serious, carefully organised, often multinational plots against specific targets involving substantial numbers of people.
For some quarters of the Islamophobia industry, it has now become Muslims who are the main victims of the Woolwich horror.
But while some innocent Muslims have of course become victims, the main victim was Drummer Lee Rigby. And in overhyping the backlash, some in the Muslim community are playing right into the hands of his killers.
Spike TV has given a 10-episode straight-to-series order to Red Mars, a scripted drama based on Kim Stanley Robinson's best-selling “hard” science-fiction trilogy about the colonization and terraforming transformation of Mars into a place where humans can live sustainably. It will premiere in January 2017.
Red Mars would be Spike TV's first drama series in a decade. That distinction was originally supposed to go to the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Harvest, ordered to series in August, but that series recently fell through, with Spike brass going back to the drawing board. The network has changed course, going in a completely new direction — from a family drama set against the black-market body-part trade (Harvest) to a hard sci-fi series set in space (Red Mars).
The Red Mars TV series, named after the first book in the trilogy, had been on fast-track development at Spike since the network took in the project la st fall with HBO's Game Of Thrones co-executive producer Vince Gerardis as executive producer and Robinson as consultant. Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski was then brought in to write and executive produce the adaptation. Skydance Television (Manhattan, Grace and Frankie) came on board as studio, with the company's David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Marcy Ross executive producing.
“The heart and soul of Red Mars is about humanity,” said Sharon Levy, Spike's EVP, Original Series. “This group of strangers must find a way to live together and survive under the most daunting conditions mankind has ever faced to become the first living generation of Martians.”
The three novels — Red Mars (1993), Green Mars (1994) and Blue Mars (1996), which have won Nebula and Hugo Awards — are noted not only for their rigorous attention to scientific detail, based on at-the-time current science and speculative science, but for the the large cast of widely different and richly detailed characters followed over the course of decades and centuries, as well as the somewhat utopian social and political ideals the novels explore. They're regarded in many quarters as the best books written on the subject of interplanetary colonization, and a holy grail for science fiction fans.
The attack happened in the Rosemount Gardens area of Derry A man shot in both legs in a paramilitary-style attack in Londonderry was awaiting sentencing for raping a 15-year-old schoolgirl. Keith Burnside, 37, was shot in his Rosemount Gardens home by two masked men in front of his girlfriend and two children at about 2315 BST on Monday. Burnside was convicted in March of raping a girl in his car at Sandbank Cottages in 2000. He is being treated in hospital for his injuries. SDLP Councillor Mark H. Durkan said he had spoken to Keith Burnside's girlfriend who witnessed the attack. "She's in an awful state of shock, it was an extremely traumatic experience for everyone involved," he said. "There were two young children in the house, a 12-week-old baby and a six-year-old who saw everything." Councillor Durkan said he did not discuss the motive for the shooting. "This attack must be condemned regardless of what it was in connection with," he added. "We cannot have this law of the jungle where people are taking the law into their own hands." Burnside was due to be sentenced for the rape shortly. During the trial the court heard that his victim blocked the attack out of her mind for seven years before reporting it, after the accused smirked at her outside a nightclub. A defence application was due to be heard in Londonderry Crown Court on Tuesday but was adjourned when the court was told of the attack. Community worker Tommy McCourt said such incidents made people fearful of a return to violence. "It takes you back to the bad old days," he said. "We believed that those days had passed and nobody wants to see this kind of thing happening again." SDLP MLA Pat Ramsey also condemned the attack. "The people who carried out this shooting have no support from the local community and no place in a civilised society," he said. The police said that those responsible were of slim build and wore tracksuits, baseball caps, and scarves over their faces. The first man was 5ft 10ins and the second 6ft 2ins. They want anyone who was in the area at the time and may have seen the men to contact them.

Not to be confused with Funnel-web spider
The black tunnelweb spider, Porrhothele antipodiana, is a spider found throughout much of New Zealand and the Chatham Islands in bush and gardens. They are related to tarantulas, and are a harmless relative of the venomous Australian funnel-web spider.[1]
Description [ edit ]
It is a large species, measuring over 30 mm in body length, 50 mm including the long legs. Males are often found indoors during spring and summer when they leave their burrows to find mates. When found inside, they are typically near a source of moisture such as a bathroom or laundry because they desiccate easily. Often all that is found indoors are shriveled corpses.
Typically, they build a silken tunnel with a broad area at the entrance for the detection of prey (often beetles, but they have been recorded eating snails and mice) under logs and rocks.[2]
Bites are painful and may cause localised swelling, itching, or numbness. Victims are advised to disinfect the area to reduce the risk of infection. The venom is not dangerous to humans.[3]
In popular culture [ edit ]
This spider was described by director Peter Jackson as the inspiration for his depiction of Shelob in his The Lord of the Rings film adaptation.[4]
RAI is requesting that retailers be allowed to issue retail cash memo which has details of all articles sold and net price including GST realised for each article. (Reuters)
The Retailers Association of India (RAI) has appealed to the finance minister to simplify the prescribed sale invoice format for cash bills rendered to customers claiming it is “confusing”. “There are some aspects of GST regime, which are causing a lot of challenges in business to consumer (B2C) at retail point of sale,” RAI said in a letter to the FM. “The GST rules define that it is mandatory to mention GST rates and HS code for each article sold and provide tax details for each line item,” the letter explained.
RAI is requesting that retailers be allowed to issue retail cash memo which has details of all articles sold and net price including GST realised for each article. “The need for individual item tax details and HS codes can be done away with for all intra-state retail sales (B2C), this exemption would be required for all retailers without any cap on sales turnover,” RAI added.
The retailers lobby claims that this would simplify the billing process, and also address the confusion faced by consumers. “Considering that all retail rates are at maximum retail price (MRP) inclusive of all taxes, the direction to now print prices with breakup of taxes, is confusing the consumers,” it said. The retailer lobby is suggesting that the GST format follow the globally retail cash memos, which are presented at prices inclusive of all taxes and tax breakups are not shown. They also raised the fact that customers perceive they are being charged higher prices when they are shown a backward calculation of tax.
Also watch:
Further, the overall retail cash memo has now become three times the length of the earlier retail memo, due to the inclusion of tax breakup, RAI said. “This measure is not environment friendly as there is a significant increase in paper consumption. Also the compliance costs will go up three times,” the letter said. Another issue causing confusion in some cases are bills contain similar items, with multiple GST rates.
With different tax rates being printed against each item even though they are the same HSN Code (for classification of goods under GST), customers are complaining they are charged higher taxes, which is not the case, RAI said. RAI also suggested that since retail bills are computer generated, there need not be a requirement to sign every bill . “We would be willing to work with the government to ensure compliance without sacrificing customer convenience,” it added.

From PRIDE in Utah:
Utah Non-Discrimination Ordinances Denied Even A Committee Hearing
Senate Bill 148, which would provide housing and workplace protections against discrimination for sexual orientation or gender identity has been denied a committee hearing. The bill sits in the Rules Committee, and chairwoman Sen Margaret Dayton (R) says its unnecessary to hear the bill.
Senator Ben McAdams introduced the legislation several weeks ago, but since then Republicans and Conservatives have lined up against it, despite the clear desire of both their constituents and their religion.
Two different state-wide surveys have shown that 70% of the residents in Utah are in favor of allowing people to work in their jobs and live in their homes without fear of being fired or evicted for reasons that have no bearing on job or rent performance. Even the Mormon Church has come forward and said that these protections are fair and should be passed state-wide.
And yet Republicans in Utah still refuse to even listen to the bill, much less vote for it … Equality Utah points out that there are still 13 days left in the session for something to happen. But at this point there is not much hope of the bill advancing.
Henry Cejudo insists he won't allow Demetrious Johnson to take him out of his element when they clash for the UFC flyweight title later this month at UFC 197.
Johnson (23-2-1 MMA, 11-1-1 UFC) is the only 125-pound champion in company history, having successfully defended the belt seven times since it's inception nearly four years ago. Cejudo (10-0 MMA, 4-0 UFC) said the reason is challengers routinely allowing “Mighty Mouse” to fight his way.
Cejudo said he won't do that, and for perhaps the first time in a long time, he's going to make Johnson uncomfortable inside the octagon.
“I don't necessarily think about winning, I think about doing things right and think about stopping what he's good at, then it's just about collaborating these together,” Cejudo told MMAjunkie. “Then sometimes it's about just throwing that all away and just fighting. Who knows I may have to fight him on one knee or one toe, so I might have to just say ‘Screw it,' and fight – screw MMA, screw all this other stuff – I'm going to fight him. If I have to fight a certain way to make him uncomfortable, I'm going to do that.”
UFC 197 takes place April 23 at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena. Johnson vs. Cejudo co-headlines the pay-per-view main card following prelims on FOX Sports 1 and UFC Fight Pass.
Johnson, No. 1 in the latest USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie MMA flyweight rankings, is one of the top-ranked fighters in the world for a reason. He's earned victories that range from early knockouts to dominant decisions to last-second submissions.
Although Johnson has shown extreme well-roundedness throughout his career, No. 4-ranked Cejudo said the key is to subtract a few main weapons from the champion's arsenal. If he can do that, Johnson will be vulnerable, he said.
“I have a style that neutralizes his strength, which is his wrestling and his striking,” Cejudo said. “He's going to feel it when we go in there. I'm just a bigger body and I'm going to fight him accordingly. I'm going adjust. I have no pride in me whatsoever. I'm not going to go blow-for-blow. I'm not going to fight fire with fire. I'm an extremely smart human being.”
Cejudo's confidence is bred by his lifelong athletic success. At just 21, Cejudo became the youngest American to even win a gold medal in freestyle wrestling at the Olympic games. He accomplished the feat in 2008 and shortly thereafter began preparing for the transition to MMA.
Now 29, Cejudo has several years in the sport and has already racked up a perfect record through 10 fights. Cejudo has already competed on arguably the biggest stage in sports, so challenging a dominant titleholder like Johnson doesn't fluster him, he said.
“It's just another fight, but it's not another fight,” Cejudo said. “The Olympics have prepared me for this and overcoming a lot of struggles and adversity. It's just another fight that brings more attention and there's more money involved in this one. That's all there is to it. The crowd, the glamor, the media, it doesn't really phase me. I've been here before and I've had over 1000 matches in wrestling.
“I'm a very experienced human being and that's one of my biggest attributes as a person. I'm just looking to fight this guy April 23. All the rest of the stuff is smoke and mirrors.”
When Cejudo was first awarded the title fight with Johnson, some critics complained the fight was happening too soon. Not because Cejudo couldn't be competitive, or even win, but that more octagon experience would create a superior matchup.
Cejudo disagrees with that notion and said the bout is coming at the perfect time. He's openly labeled Johnson as a “boring” and uninteresting champion and believes the division; UFC and fans are ready for change at the top after Johnson's long reign. “The Messenger” said he's going to be the instrument for that change.
“A lot of it comes from my past accolades: I'm a gold medalist and soon-to-be UFC champion, I'm of Mexican decent and am fluent in the language,” Cejudo said. “I believe I'm a huge marketing tool not just for the U.S. but also for Latin America. I'm the type of person that fluent, well-spoken in English and fluent and well spoken in Spanish. This is a bomb waiting to blow up and I'm excited to do it April 23rd.”

The Nepean and Bargo River Gorge is one step closer to becoming a national park after Wollondilly Council supported a call for the dedication of a 150-metre publicly-owned buffer zone between the edge of the gorge and a housing development. National Parks Association Macarthur branch member Julie Sheppard said it was a good outcome for the association. At Monday night's council meeting councillors voted to accept an application from Celestino (formerly EJC) for 125 rural residential lots and one open space lot at River Road, Tahmoor, with one amendment. The amendment requires Celestino to gift the Nepean and Bargo River Gorge area to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for the creation of a national park or reserve or to the council. "Ideally we don't want the development at all," Ms Sheppard said. "None of us like to see agricultural land taken over by big houses. "But it is the best development in terms of environmental protection we could hope for. It is a compromise." Councillor Kate Terry said the right decision had been made because the gorge needed to be protected to allow a national park listing for future generations to enjoy. Councillor Judith Hannan echoed the sentiment. Thirlmere resident David Hunt said the adjoining lots would be reduced in length to allow for the buffer zone. "I think it was a good outcome and the best we could have hoped for," Mr Hunt said. Ms Sheppard said the next step was to continue lobbying the government to get the area listed as a national park. A change.org petition that calls for the protection of the gorge now has 1500 signatures which the association hopes to present to NSW Minister for the Environment Mark Speakman if he visits the area. Celestino declined to comment when contacted by the Advertiser. ■ To support a petition campaigning for protection of the gorge, visit https://www.change.org/p/cr-simon-landow-mayor-of-wollondilly-mark-speakman-nsw-minister-for-the-environment-protect-mermaids-pool-and-the-tahmoor-gorge?recruiter=22818083&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=autopublish&utm_term=mob-xs-share_petition-no_msg

The New Mexico state House Judiciary Committee scheduled a public hearing Saturday to consider House Bill 548 — a “dummy bill” the National Rifle Association warns will be stuffed with language regulating guns.
Rep. Stephanie Garcia Richard, D-Los Alamos, sponsored the bill Friday. Her original proposal, House Bill 50 — which would require background checks for virtually all firearm transfers in the state — stalled in the committee last month. With just a week of session remaining, HB 548 could be Richard's last chance to revive the measure, according to the NRA.
Richard, who said she once bought a handgun from a stranger in a McDonald's parking lot, expressed concern about the ease of such private sales.
“He seemed like a nice guy, but no names were asked, no IDs were shown,” she said earlier this month. “We simply looked at the gun, paid in cash and less than five minutes later we drove away with this gun.”
The NRA said Everytown for Gun Safety, funded by former New York City mayor and staunch gun control advocate Michael Bloomberg, used its research to influence New Mexico lawmakers into supporting HB 50 and its companion proposal, Senate Bill 48, despite its restrictive and confusing language.
Everytown detailed an investigation of online firearm marketplaces in New Mexico in a report released Feb. 8. Group investigators, who posted more than two dozen online ads for firearms as part of its examination, said one in 15 prospective buyers couldn't legally own a gun due to criminal records — two-thirds of which still had active warrants or were either on parole or probation.
The NRA argued Friday, despite waning support, Richard and other bill proponents haven't given up.
“It (HB 50) has languished there for over a month,” the association said in a blog post Friday. “But we noted how desperate the advocates for HB 50 are to pass anything and warned you that the language in the measure could be watered-down in an attempt to muster the votes to pass it late in the session or amended into another bill altogether. It looks like that's the route they plan on taking in hopes it will fool you or unsuspecting lawmakers!”
Bloomberg bankrolled a ballot referendum in Nevada last year expanding background checks to private sales. The measure passed by less than 10,000 votes, with critics deeming it virtually unenforceable due to a technicality in the language of the law. Nevada State Attorney General Adam Laxalt issued an opinion in December reiterating as much and has yet to set an implementation date.
The Justice Department is taking its war on drugs worldwide, CNN reports.
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced the first-of-its-kind indictment against two Chinese nationals who were allegedly manufacturing and trafficking to the US fentanyl and fentanyl analogues, substances that can be 50 times as potent as heroin.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl and fentanyl analogues in 2016.
The Chinese nationals were using the internet and dark web to sell fentanyl to U.S. customers, many of whom were too inexperienced or unaware to realize they were buying the highly pure substance, Rosenstein told reporters Tuesday.
"They use multiple identities to disguise their activities and their shipments and to obscure the trail of profits going back to China." – Rod Rosenstein
"They take advantage of the fact that the fentanyl molecule can be altered in numerous ways to create a fentanyl analogue that is not listed as illegal under U.S. or Chinese law,” he added. “When regulators are able to identify the new fentanyl and make it illegal, the distributors quickly switch to a new, unlisted fentanyl analogue."
Investigators tracked down the two Chinese defendants, Xiaobing Yan, 40, and Jian Zhang, 38, and the chemical plants they operated in China after a series of local law enforcement crackdowns in Mississippi and North Dakota, according to the indictment.
A routine traffic stop in Mississippi in 2013 first unearthed a domestic drug ring tied to Yan. The ring sold synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids, commonly known as "spice" or "bath salts," and delivered the products through parcel delivery services, according to the Justice Department. Yan allegedly operated websites advertising the deadly fentanyl and sold it directly to customers in several cities around the country, Rosenstein said.
Zhang was pinpointed in the wake of the death of an 18-year-old who died after a fentanyl overdose in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Federal agents identified another Grand Forks resident as the source of the fentanyl, and discovered that the buyer had used crypto-currency Bitcoin to buy the drugs over the Internet for more than a year, "using an encrypted website on the Dark Web," Rosenstein said. Prosecutors were eventually able to trace the drugs to Zhang's distribution network in China.
Five Canadian citizens, two residents of Florida, and one resident of New Jersey were also indicted in connection with Zhang's drug ring on charges of conspiracy to distribute the drugs in at least 11 states, according to the Justice Department.
The indictments were announced after President Donald Trump's nominee for drug czar, Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, withdrew his name from consideration for the position. The withdrawal came amid fallout from a joint investigation by The Washington Post and CBS' "60 Minutes" that revealed Marino took nearly $100,000 from the pharmaceutical lobby while sponsoring legislation that made it easier for drug companies to distribute opioids, but also thwarted the Drug Enforcement Agency's efforts.

DOOM is featured in the latest issue of Intersection Magazine, a car/culture/fashion magazine, with an interview by Tom Hall covering his latest project JJ DOOM, and – perhaps most important of all? – his passion for motorized, radio-controlled toy cars.
“I'll easily spend two thousand dollars on one of those. Every kid wants to have a remote controlled car, but back when I was a kid we couldn't afford it. One day I said OK I'm goinna treat myself and there down 500 dollars for one of these. It was a T-Maxx from the Traxxas company."
Intersection set DOOM up with a array of cars to test and review (rating scale: 1-5 masks). The second place is seen below. To find out what took the top spot, pick up Intersection's winter issue at the local newsstand or online at Intersection Mag.
COMING IN SPRING: DOOM X FRANK151
Building a spinning costume for Sacramento Comicon
By Rob Cockerham | June 20, 2017
I'm a big believer in making costumes which capture a popular trend or a fad... but some fads come and go before halloween time. The fidget spinner seemed like one of those trends. They were unknown in May, super popular in June, but clearly on the decline as school let out for the summer 2017. There was no way even a small splash of the fidget spinner fad would last until halloween.
Luckily, there was a comic book convention coming into town, and comic conventions require a costume.
This was my chance! By the time I heard that Comic con was coming to Sacramento, I had eight days to get a costume ready. I'd need to make it quick.
A spinning costume hinged on having a bearing large enough to fit my face through. Amazon had some nice big aluminum ones for sale, but I figured I could save some time and money at my local cool hardware store: Ace. They had 12" lazy susan bearings for $13. These are the heavy-duty version of the turntable inside your microwave oven. Perfect!
Well, the face hole was a little too small, so I snipped some of the metal away and left a ragged oval shape.
I ground off the sharp edges so it wouldn't cut my face off when I spun it.
My garage is full of pvc harnesses from previous costumes, so I just needed a smooth PVC arch to hold the bearing. I bend PVC pipes with a heat gun.
With the new arch screwed into the old black shoulder harness, the bearing sat right around my face.
It could work. One plate of the bearing was attached to the arch, and the other plate was ready to be attached to something large that could freely spin in a circle around my face.
Now I just needed to build the world's largest fidget spinner.
It needed to be lightweight, so styrofoam was the obvious answer, however, it also had to be strong enough for screws to hold. I settled on using a sheet of styrofoam glued to a thin sheet of plywood.
The pattern. I tried to get the largest possible fidget spinner out of a 4x8 foot styrofoam sheet.
Five days before the convention, at halftime of the Warrior's game, I ran to Home Depot to grab sheets of styrofoam and Lauan plywood. I brought plenty of twine to strap them to my car's roof, but a stranger with a truck spotted me tying them down in the parking lot and asked where I was going. I wasn't going far, and as you have probably guessed, he offered to bring them to my house for me.
He followed me home and I was super grateful and a little sad I didn't have a six-pack or gift card to offer him. There are nice people everywhere.
The scaled-up version of the fidget spinner had three main circles, with a 15" radius. I didn't have any 30" circles around my house, so I used the old nail/string/pen drawing compass technique.
One of the three circles would have to be cut seperately and attached to the side of the sheet.
I used a variety of bowls and lids to draw scaled versions of the rest of the giant spinner.
With the shape cut, I used a can of expanding foam to glue styro to styro. I had an idea that I might need to make the costume disassemble, so that I could fit it into my car. In the end I built it as a single piece and knew I could figure out transportation later.
The plywood was even easier to cut. Super 77 spray glue worked well to to attach the thin sheet of plywood to one side of the styrofoam.
If I did it again, I would have cut the plywood first, then glued it to the styrofoam and used the plywood shape as a template for the hot styro cutting wire.
My kids were wowed by the size of this monster fidget spinner.
The finished costume was going to be huge.
It was six feet tall, and the final project would be resting on my shoulders, several feet above the ground. Even without spinning, it would be a sight to behold!
I was running out of time, so I painted it that very evening and let it dry overnight.
The outside circles of a fidgit spinner are also ball bearings, usually colored black and metallic. I used a mirror as my template to slice semi-circles out of a sheet of Metal-FX Contact Shelf paper. The shelf paper had an adhesive back and looked like brushed steel.
The holes also got treated with a metal-look donut of shelf paper.
The metal went down with a few wrinkles, but the final effect had the look of a spinner.
The next day was the convention, and I had to finish up my costume. I touched up the paint and carefully screwed the harness/lazy susan to the plywood side of the blue spinner. I used ten long screws and was careful not to "strip out" the delicate styrofoam from behind their holes. Thanks to the styrofoam sheet weighing less than 12 lbs., it felt very secure!
For a moment I panicked, because the lower two sticks of the harness were scraping against the blue tri-shape as it turned, but some judiciously-applied heat from a heat gun allowed me to bend them safely out of orbit.
It was great! The center hole framed my face really nicely, something that I take very seriously when it comes to making costumes.
My logic is, if it is around my face, I'm DRESSED AS a fidget spinner. If it is around my waist, I'm WEARING a fidget spinner.
I loved it! It looked great, was unmistakable and shockingly huge, spun like a champ and was light enough to carry around all day! This was going to be epic!
The only downside was that I couldn't fit it in my car! I hadn't arranged to borrow a truck and I the big Uber vans are built for luxury and comfortable passengers, not unweildy plywood and styrofoam cargo.
No problem. I could take the bus! An all-day pass cost $7. Not counting the bus driver, everyone embraced the costume immediately... although not everyone was sure what it was.
"Is that for bean bags?" I made a note to myself to re-purpose this thing for a bean-bag toss.
"That's a BIG whatever those things are called!" one street-smart rider called out.
Downtown was crowded with people, and comic book nerds were packed everywhere, lining up to get into the Con. I turned the corner into full view and was greeted with open iphones, gaping mouths and spontaneous applause! It was awesome! The gigantic fidget spinner was an absolute hit that the crowds loved!
"OH DAMN! MIKE! LOOK! FIDGET SPINNERRRRR!" x 1000.
I love being stopped for photos, and with the fidget spinner costume I had a special trick: Invariably the photographer would click through and snap a picture, thank me and then slowly realize the whole truth.
"Does it.... spin?"
I would slowly nod. "Yes. It does!" Then I'd back up and give it a big whirl and they would shriek or just shake their heads in amazement. It was incredible!
Giant spinning costumes from now on!
Thank you Wizard World Comic Con!
Android is a free open-source operating system. The AOSP (Android Open Source Project) is free to download, free to alter, free to build into a product that can power just about anything. But it's probably not something you've ever used when you picked up a phone or other gizmo that runs "Android". Android is not a thing as much as something you use to make a thing. At its heart, Android is nothing more than a platform that anyone can use to run applications plus the bits and pieces needed for it to talk to standard hardware. We tend to think of Android as an operating system for a phone or tablet (or even a watch or television), but it's just a part of the software needed to get any device to turn on and do things. That being said, it's one of the most important parts. Having a huge library of code that anyone can use is great. Having all the things people build with it able to use the same applications is even better. It's better for us because we will have a huge list of applications that work out of the box when we buy an Android-powered device. It's better for the companies making the devices because we'll want to buy them and they don't have to put in the work to build their own application platform. It's also great for Google because it means more devices will be able to use the internet and its services.
That last part is why Google maintains the AOSP. Google has always held the belief that everyone should have access to the internet. While some of the reasons may be altruistic and good-natured, the main reason Google as a company has these goals is because the internet is how it makes money. All companies exist to make mone, but with the AOSP, Google has found a new way to make money from everyone while giving away one of its most expensive products: Android. This is done through the AOSP. Google maintains the Android source code. That means exactly what you think it does: It keeps things clean and tidy and up-to-date, then makes it available for other people. It also has people working full time to make improvements and add new features to Android. All of this is made available for anyone to freely use under a liberal license that allows changes to be made to the code and not submitted back to the maintainers. Samsung is allowed to do whatever it wants with the AOSP. So are you, and so am I. If we do something different, we can keep those changes to ourselves to offer a (hopefully) better product than anyone else can.
But the phones and gadgets we buy aren't running the AOSP as an operating system. What we see is the end result of someone or some company using it to create software that is unique and their own. This can be done by changing the code or by adding more code or even adding applications that aren't open sourced like the AOSP is. Every company that sells Android-powered gadgets, including Google itself, is doing this. But even this fits into Google's methods to make money because there are some restrictions when a company wants to use Google's popular applications and services. The process is a circle. Google gives Android away. A company uses it on its phone. As consumers, we want Android phones that can use Google Play and Gmail and Google Photos and all the other things that make Android great. The company making the phone can bundle those features in for free as long as it makes sure its product can use every other application found in the Google Play Store. Phone manufacturers, like Samsung, save time and money by not building their own application platform and application storefront; we get a phone with access to all the apps we love plus a market with over a million others, and Google gets a lot of people using its services and being on the internet to see Google's ads.
By making Android a big piece of an operating system that anyone can use for free, Google's investment in it pays off.
Matt Levine's newsletter Money Stuff is always excellent and usually funny. (And the poor man knows I think so.) However, this passage from the August 12th dispatch soberly explains one of the main ways the United States' political system enforces capitalism:
“Loosely speaking, there are two main kinds of income: income from labor, like salaries, and income from capital, like dividends and capital gains. In the U.S., the former is taxed more heavily than the latter, with a top marginal rate of 39.6 percent on ordinary income, versus 20 percent on capital gains and dividends. There are a number of efficiency and fairness arguments in favor of a lower tax rate on capital gains, but there are also those who suspect that an important reason for the difference is that (1) rich people tend to get more of their income from capital than poor people do, (2) rich people tend to prefer to pay lower taxes, and (3) rich people tend to get their preferred policies enacted.”
Pest controller unearths treasure trove of century-old papers under postmaster's house
Posted
It is the find of the century for the River Murray town of Morgan — thousands of telegrams and ledgers dating back 138 years and left long-forgotten under an old postmaster's house.
The historic horde includes mail records and produce ledgers of cargo unloaded at the town's wharf from the paddle boats that plied the River Murray.
Pest controller Tim Owens discovered the hidden hessian bags after cutting a floor trap in the floorboards of the old Morgan postmaster's house during a recent pest inspection.
"I was hoping it was gold, or lots of notes, but it didn't happen like that," Mr Owens said with a laugh.
He ranks it as the most significant find in his nine years working as a pest controller.
"I have found a lot of stuff under houses, tins, bottles, hessian water bags, lights, any rubbish during construction, a lot of it significant to Australia because it's not manufactured anymore," Mr Owens said.
And while he likes to collect these relics of bygone days, he recognised the value of the find and suggested the homeowner deliver it into the care of Morgan council heritage officer Di Hausler.
"Everyone in my position dreams of a find like this, heritage-wise, this is unbelievable," Ms Hausler said.
The chance discovery gives an insight into life from 1879, the year after a new railway linked the river trading port with Adelaide, marking the start of a boom period for Morgan.
Ms Hausler now has the job of carefully reading, photographing and archiving every single page.
The postal records and telegrams stop in 1912, the year a new post office was built in Morgan.
"Every letter sent, every mail bag sent to stations at those times, everything was recorded by hand; we've got copies of everything from 1879 to 1912."
Documents in 'pristine condition' for their age
Just how the documents came to be stored or hidden under the building remains unclear, but it seems whoever was responsible sensed they could be valuable for posterity.
"They were in hessian bags, tied with old jute string; some of the hessian bags had salt crystals inside another small hessian bag to keep the moisture out," Ms Hausler said.
She said that those covered by dirt through years of neglect were in the best condition.
"They were in pristine condition considering they were 138 years old."
While a thorough look through all the documents will take many months, already names of River boat captains Hughie King, William Randall and Albert Dunk, and merchant and politician Albert Henry Landseer have been spotted.
"These things are really relevant to Morgan and us being able to piece together our history," Ms Hausler said.
Telegrams were the quickest way to send word during the river boat trade era.
"At one point the station master here sent a message to one of the station masters in Kapunda complaining that one of the workers was lazy and inconsiderate," Ms Hausler said of the contents of one telegram.
"'Please write to me' was the message; everything that was important was sent by brief word and then dealt with by a letter afterwards."
Collection to go on public display
There are plans for the collection to be available for viewing by the public once it has been archived.
"The actual town's timeline can be built off these documents," Ms Hausler said.
"It is phenomenal, it is not just people like myself who get excited; it is other people who can see their family's history displayed."

Romanian officials on Tuesday expressed support for the government of neighbouring Moldova and urged Russia not to encourage separatists in Moldova's Transdniester region in their quest to join Russia.
“Romania together with its EU and NATO partners should show their commitment to supporting Moldova's independence and territorial integrity,” Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta said.
Ponta spoke one day after the speaker of Transdniester's separatist parliament, during a trip to Moscow, urged Russia to incorporate his mainly Russian-speaking region, which split away from Moldova in 1990.
Romania is concerned that after taking over the strategic peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, Russia may be tempted to try a land grab in Moldova. Russian troops are already stationed in Transdniester.
“There is above all a fear of possible contagion in the region. Romania is extremely preoccupied,” Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean said in a recent interview.
In related development, Moldovan President Nicolae Timofti on Tuesday said Russia would be making a “mistake” if it agreed to the request for annexation from Transdniester's officials. “This is an illegal body,” Timofti told a news conference.
“I believe that such actions are counter-productive and will do no good for Moldova or Russia. If Russia makes a move to satisfy such proposals, it will make a mistake,” he said.
Russia has said nothing about any designs on Moldova. But on Tuesday President Vladimir Putin signed a bill allowing Russia to absorb the Crimean peninsula, which was Russian until 1954, when the former Soviet authorities assigned it to Ukraine.
Analysts say tensions between pro-Russian Crimeans and pro-European Ukrainians remind Moldovans of their own separatist conflict involving Transdniester.
The strip of territory on Moldova's eastern border with Ukraine declared independence with Russian help in 1990, after Moldova broke away from the Soviet Union.
It has a predominantly ethnic Russian and Ukrainian population. The two sides fought a short war in 1992.
No country has recognized its independence. But, although in international eyes Transdniester remains part of Moldova, it has no power there.
The problem has defied international efforts at a settlement on the part of the OSCE, Russia, the EU and the United States.
While the developments in Crimea have roused fears in both Romania and Moldova that a similar scenario could occur in Transdniester, analysts see no reason to worry for the time being.
“There is no sign that the situation in Crimea will be replicated in Transdniester. Besides, even Moscow recognizes the authorities in Moldova,” Romanian diplomat Mircea Geoana noted.
Moldova was part of Romania before the Soviet Union annexed it in World War II. Before the First World War it was part of Tsarist Russia.
A landlocked country lying between Romania and Ukraine, most people speak Romanian, although the country's constitution calls the language Moldovan. Russian is widely spoken.
Russia and neighbouring EU member Romania vie for influence in Moldova, where reforms are needed to end corruption and depoliticise key institutions like the judiciary and police.
Could consuming a diet rich in animal protein be just as bad for you as smoking cigarettes?
The answer, according to a new study out of the University of Southern California's Davis School of Gerontology, is yes, provided a few specific factors are also considered:
That chicken wing you're eating could be as deadly as a cigarette. In a new study that tracked a large sample of adults for nearly two decades, researchers have found that eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you four times more likely to die of cancer than someone with a low-protein diet — a mortality risk factor comparable to smoking. “There's a misconception that because we all eat, understanding nutrition is simple. But the question is not whether a certain diet allows you to do well for three days, but can it help you survive to be 100?” said corresponding author Valter Longo, Edna M. Jones Professor of Biogerontology at the USC Davis School of Gerontology and director of the USC Longevity Institute. Not only is excessive protein consumption linked to a dramatic rise in cancer mortality, but middle-aged people who eat lots of proteins from animal sources — including meat, milk and cheese — are also more susceptible to early death in general, revealed the study published today in Cell Metabolism. Protein-lovers were 74 percent more likely to die of any cause within the study period than their more low-protein counterparts. They were also several times more likely to die of diabetes
However, protein intake and its impact on overall health takes on a different profile past the middle-aged mark, the study also found.

Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is taking aim at Jimmy Kimmel, saying that if the comedian "wants to mock our Christian values" he should come to Alabama "and do it man to man."
The comments come after it was discovered that comedian Tony Barbieri, who frequently plays the character Jake Byrd on Kimmel's late-night show, posed as a pro-Moore supporter during one of the candidate's speeches on Wednesday. Moore's speech was in a nearly 150-year-old church in Mobile, Alabama, and was interrupted by some actual protesters, according to AL.com
Advertisement:
"The entire time, all the girls are lying?" a protester shouted.
After shouting ensued between Moore's supporters and protesters, the candidate signaled to police and asked to "get them out."
But then Barbieri shouted back at the protesters and pretended to defend Moore.
"Hey come on, get out of here dude, we're here for the judge, we're here for the judge," Barbieri yelled. "He's a man's man, the judge is a man's man!"
Barbieri looked at Moore and reassured him, "You got this judge, don't listen to them."
As someone eventually tried to have Barbieri go back to his seat, he shouted, "Does that look like the face of a molester?" The comedian was later asked to leave after he stood up and yelled, "Does that look like someone who hits on teenage girls?" AL.com reported.

Needless to say, when the Moore campaign figured out who Barbieri was, they were not pleased. However, it's still not clear if Barbieri was sent by Kimmel or his show's staff for a stunt related to his late-night show.
But that doesn't seem to matter to Moore, who believes the liberals and gays are out to get him, or to his campaign.
.@jimmykimmel If you want to mock our Christian values, come down here to Alabama and do it man to man. #ALSen https://t.co/E7oQB9D83P — Judge Roy Moore (@MooreSenate) November 30, 2017
"Jimmy Kimmel and the 'Hollywood elite' cross the line when they invade our Churches under a disguise and attempt to make a mockery of our worship services," Drew Messer, a senior adviser to Moore, told Breitbart News on Thursday.
"If Kimmel wants to mock our Christian values, he should come down here and do it man to man instead of hiding behind a camera in Hollywood." He continued, "And yes, Jimmy, we will still rebuild our military, build the wall, protect our gun rights, reform our tax code, and support President Trump whether you like that or not. Hollywood will not bully us around."

Kimmel replied to Moore's tweet and sarcastically said, "Sounds great Roy - let me know when you get some Christian values and I'll be there!"
The United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and perhaps other districts of the Department of Justice as well, have been running a secret docket for years. As the President submitted the nomination of Loretta Lynch to serve as the Attorney General of the United States—the country's chief law enforcement officer—courageous lawyers are asking the Supreme Court to review a case that reveals how Ms. Lynch, her predecessors, and her prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York put cases on a secret docket that has allowed admitted criminals to walk free, deprived their victims of millions of dollars of restitution required under the law, and enabled the criminals to commit more crimes against the unsuspecting public.
The case is Palmer v. John Doe, #14-676, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to confer on the petition today—Friday, January 9. The Department of Justice has registered no response to the Petition. This isn't the first time the Department has tried to kill something by silence.
At stake is far more than the issue of restitution of hundreds of millions of stolen dollars. There is a fundamental failure of the Department of Justice to protect innocent citizens from known criminals in a massive secret star-chamber for which there is no review or means of accountability. It is more government lawlessness and making its own rules as it goes— an unsupervised “cooperator game” at immeasurable cost to justice, faith and trust in the fairness of our system.
Hopefully, the Supreme Court will take the case and review this unholy practice, but regardless, the public needs to take a close look at the allegations in the petition, which the government has completely declined to address other than,as we saw with similar tactics that we recently reported on in the Moonlight Fire case, by wielding threats of reprisals against the lawyers who are trying to disclose the truth.
The petition reveals that prosecutors have a terrifying set of double standards and secret deals—one for “cooperators” and one for those who decline to cooperate. The cooperators in the cases on the secret docket are allowed to plead guilty and to go about their lives with virtual immunity for any crimes they continue to commit—and commit them they do. It's one thing for a prosecutor to make a deal with a cooperator. It's another thing for the deal to be a complete secret for years that enables the cooperator to resume his criminal conduct—not only licensed but protected by the government.
Another ramification of such unlawful secrecy is the unjust convictions that result when the truth of the deal and history of the cooperator are not disclosed to other defendants. Just ask the California man ordered released from nine years in prison after the Department of Justice admitted today that “thousands of pages of documents that should have been turned over to the defense had secretly remained locked in a Sacramento FBI office for years.” According to the Sacramento Bee, the defense attorney had demanded this evidence of the cooperator repeatedly and was told there was none—all the while, the FBI was hiding it. This is the same United States Attorney's Office that brought the now notorious Moonlight Fire case about which the Observer broke news and others have written.
According to the Washington Times, Felix Sater's lawyer asserts that Mr. Sater has been a model citizen during the 10 years between his secret guilty plea and his sentencing. That is a subject of serious dispute in the petition.
But the bigger concerns now are the knowledge, ethics, and policies of the proposed new Attorney General and the fact that high ranking members of the Department of Justice have played on role on both sides of Mr. Sater's secret case in the Eastern District of New York. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, head of the criminal division of the Department of Justice, was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York during the year Mr. Sater was charged. Then, after joining Morgan Lewis, she represented Mr. Sater at his sentencing on the secret docket in her old district. That raises a plethora of ethical issues, but she's not alone. The petition also discloses that Marshall Miller, principal deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division was, ironically, the victim rights' coordinator for the Eastern District of New York.
The Economist has recently written extensively about the world of cooperators and over-criminalization. The Wall Street Journal this week has joined our chorus on prosecutorial secrecy and misconduct, today's being “Sunshine For Prosecutors.” Seems that the Journal's editorial earlier this week helped the government to decide to produce some additional information to which Hank Greenberg has long been entitled. Sunlight is indeed a powerful and natural disinfectant, but we sense that we are merely scraping the surface of a deeply infected wound to Lady Justice.
The petition, filed in the Supreme Court by lawyers who have contempt charges hanging over their heads for revealing what they know, explains that the pretext for continued secrecy rested on nothing more than the prosecutors' bald assertions of risk of harm to cooperator Felix Sater. The Russian mob is implicated, and any number of federal judges seem to have rubber-stamped the government's assertions.
However, there have been repeated public disclosures that Mr. Sater was cooperating, and he was not placed in the witness protection program. Instead, the petition claims, the United States Attorneys allowed him to continue to bilk banks and individuals of millions of dollars. He was never ordered to pay restitution to any of his original victims, and worse, he was protected by the government in his crimes against new victims. Ms. Lynch has vehemently opposed release of the information that the Petition seeks to have unsealed.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, the Government Oversight Committee, and the Senate all have their work cut out for them. This evidence raises more troubling questions about our now ironically named Department of Justice and those who run it. Ms. Lynch must be held to account for this secret docket in hearings on her nomination. How widespread is the practice, and how many additional victims of fraud and other crimes has the Department of Justice caused by this practice? Surely Ms. Lynch's district is not the only one to run a secret docket. Presumably, our Attorney General knows. Why are federal judges allowing this? How many criminals have committed additional crimes because of this perversion of the system?
We have written extensively about Eric Holder protecting corrupt prosecutors. This country can't afford a new boss same as the old boss.
UPDATE: Representatives for Felix Sater dispute this story's characterization of the value of their client's information and his behavior since cooperating. Mr Sater's attorney, Robert Wolf, told the Observer: “Mr. Sater provided extraordinary cooperation with the government, which spanned two decades and involved the most serious matters of National Security, battling our greatest enemies at tremendous risk to his own life and for the benefit of all citizens of our country. This cooperation extended to the highest levels of our government and involved some of our biggest enemies whose terrorism threatened our safety.”

(Newser) – "Why is a powerful country like China so afraid of a beauty queen?" Anastasia Lin asked in 2015 after the country denied her a visa to keep her from competing in the annual Miss World pageant being held there. The New York Times reports the 26-year-old Canadian beauty queen has rubbed China the wrong way because she uses her platform to speak out against the country's human rights abuses. “I don't care about all this—the hair, the dresses,” Lin tells the Boston Globe. “I just want to get to that stage and be the voice for people who are silenced.” But now family and friends say Lin is the one being silenced, threatened with being booted from the 2016 Miss World pageant—funded largely by Chinese companies despite being held in the US this year—if she continues to speak her mind.
Moments after Lin gave the Globe the above quote, pageant officials broke up the interview. And sources tell the Hollywood Reporter that Miss World has turned down requests from the AP, Times, and Reuters to interview Lin. After a State Department official requested to meet with Lin, Miss World reportedly insisted on a pageant chaperone. Lin, also an actor, is the star of The Bleeding Edge, a film about China harvesting organs from members of a banned religious group that is premiering in the US on Wednesday. Organizers of the premiere say Miss World is banning her from attending. The head of the Miss World pageant denies any sort of "gag order" on Lin, saying she's free to attend events and speak with anyone she wishes. (Read more Miss World stories.)
[Warning: This story contains spoilers through the first six installments of Showtime's Twin Peaks: The Return.]
Six hours into the new Twin Peaks, there's still no clear indication of why Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is now inhabiting the life of a doppelgänger named Dougie Jones. There's no telling what that ethereal purple ocean was all about. We still don't know why William Hastings (Matthew Lillard) can't remember murdering his lover. Really, we're no closer to comprehending virtually any of the mysterious happenings the David Lynch and Mark Frost series has lobbed in the air thus far — but at least one question can be answered definitively: It's not about the bunny.
Or is it about the bunny?
Don't ask Michael Horse, the actor who plays Deputy Tommy "Hawk" Hill, one of several familiar faces from the original Twin Peaks who returned for the Showtime revival.
"I don't have any idea," he tells The Hollywood Reporter with a big laugh, recalling the fourth episode's scene in which Hawk openly wonders whether a chocolate bunny is the key to unraveling the show's mysteries. "When we shot that, I thought, 'No way. They're going to cut this out.' Well, they didn't!"
Bunnies aside, Deputy Hawk stands right at the center of the Twin Peaks puzzle, tasked with tracking down Dale Cooper more than two decades after the soulful agent went missing. Hawk receives his marching orders from the Log Lady, played by the late Catherine E. Coulson, who offers only the most enigmatic of clues: "It has something to do with your heritage."
Hawk followed that thread to a bathroom stall in the sixth hour of the series, discovering a cache of letters hidden behind a restroom door that was marked with an image from his heritage. What's contained in the letters, and where will the information lead Hawk next in the Cooper investigation? It's impossible to say at this stage, but at the very least, it's leading to more for Hawk. "I've got some stuff coming up that's going to be pretty cool," says Horse.
Here's what else the actor tells THR about the new Twin Peaks, why he was initially reluctant about returning to this world, working with Lynch, the key to understanding the show's mysteries and more.
What's your approach to Twin Peaks? As Hawk, you're playing someone who is very plugged into the mysteries of the show and the world it inhabits. What's your entry point into the series?
You know, it's so interesting. People used to ask me if it's going to come back. Part of me hoped it wasn't. It's kind of like James Dean died and left a legend out there. I had mixed feelings. There are so many wonderful shows out there now that are so outside of the box — some of the greatest TV that I have ever seen. I thought maybe it won't be a big deal anymore. And then I came back, and two days into it, I went, "Oh, I forgot. There's nobody like David. There's just nobody like him." I had kind of forgot. Everything that's out there that I like — American Gods and Taboo and Fargo — they all have Twin Peaks' DNA all over 'em. You know, I've known David for a long time. Both of us were painters, before I even got in the business [as an actor]. I'm an artist. You don't get that many opportunities in television to do art, and that's what David does, you know.
A lot of people will say about the show, "I don't get it and I don't understand it." And I tell them it's like a dream. A lot of indigenous cultures, we believe that the dream world is just as real as the physical world. And a lot of Twin Peaks is like a dream. Sometimes when you're dreaming, it doesn't move at the same pace as the real world. Sometimes when you wake up, you go, "What does that mean?" Watching Twin Peaks sometimes is liking watching somebody else's dream. It can be very uncomfortable. But it's extremely fascinating. A lot of answers to questions are revealed to us in the dream world. I think that's what Twin Peaks does.
How does that apply to the making of this series? For example, castmembers only received portions of the script that involved their characters. Did it ever feel like you were participating in a waking dream, while working on Twin Peaks?
It's like being in one of David's paintings. It's like being in a living painting. There's still parts of it that I don't get. The Hawk gets all of it. Hawk understands all of it. I wish I was as intuitive as that character. And [series co-creator Frost] understands it. Mark is very in tune to my culture. We've had long discussions about what native people believe, especially up in that area. We believe in the power of nature. There are sacred holy places up in that area.
After the first new episodes aired, some fans online pointed out a moment from the show's original run, where Cooper tells Hawk, "If I ever get lost, I hope you're the man they send to find me." It's pretty amazing that this exact scenario is playing out on the show now.
I hadn't watched the [original series] in years, and I sat and watched it with my wife. There are things I didn't remember. This whole thing about when Cooper told Hawk, "I hope it's you." I had forgotten all about that, but it makes sense to me. The Hawk is kind of the rock of this whole thing. The Hawk is the one person that really got his feet in both worlds.
What does a scene like that say about how Lynch and Frost write this series? Do you think they intentionally planted these seeds all the way back in the original show, or do you think their approach is more that they look back and see what was planted, intentionally or otherwise, and they go in the direction of where that's grown?
Well, I can't speak for them. I really can't. And I'm not being coy. I don't know what those two discuss. But I think so. I was having a discussion with a friend of mine — a very, very clever friend of mine — who would say, "Look, Michael, I don't understand this [show]." And I said that there's so much going on there. There's so much. If it was anybody else other than David, I might go, well, they're just sticking things in here. But everything, everything, makes sense in David's world. I said sometimes you have to meet him. You have to know David to understand what he does.
How exciting was it when you realized Hawk would be such a central character in the revival? So far, most of the action in Twin Peaks proper threads through Hawk.
I was thrilled to death. You know, everybody kept asking me when it was going to come back if I was going to be in it, and nobody had called me yet. Then David called me and said, "Hey buddy, we're getting the gang back together." He's such a sweet guy. It's like talking to somebody out of a '50s sitcom, you know? (Laughs.) Well, I said, "You got something for me?" He goes, "Yeah, I got something for you." I would have been thrilled to have a cameo, pal. And so far? I mean, I got to say goodbye to the Log Lady, you know? I mean, that alone — I'm a piece of television history. I've done everything from Walker, Texas Ranger to Malcolm in the Middle, but something like Twin Peaks doesn't come around often. And it was a really, really good native character. It held some mirrors up to some stereotypes about native people and did away with some of them, so I'm really proud of it.
One of the strongest elements of the series so far is things feeling familiar but different at the same time. Take Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), for instance, who is so memorable as a rebellious teen, and now works as a member of the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department. Was there a similar sense on set, this combination of old and new ideas?
You know, I hate to be corny, but it was like we never left. And the new people were so excited, like [Robert Forster, who plays Frank Truman]. Getting a chance to work with a legend? He's the real deal. Everything you've seen in every movie, he's that guy. He was so sweet. He kind of went, "Hey, Michael, I don't get this." And I would go, "I was in it, and I don't get it either!" (Laughs.) He had so much fun. You know he was having a ball just doing it, once he settled into it. But I've got some stuff coming up that's going to be pretty cool, too. You know, I'm just pleased to be in it as much as I have been. I would've been pleased with a cameo. They were very generous and very, very kind.

Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa has declared Edward Snowden's special travel document to be invalid because he doesn't want WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to look like he's "running the show." Correa declared Snowden's travel pass, issued after the U.S. revoked his passport, was unauthorized, The Wall Street Journal's José de Córdoba and Jeanne Whalen report, after a series of messages between Ecuadorean government officials worried over Assange's role. The ambassador to the U.S., Nathalie Cely, wrote to Correa's spokesman, "I suggest talking to Assange to better control the communications. From outside, [Assange] appears to be running the show." It's like the scene in Almost Famous, when members of the band Stillwater gets into an argument over their band's promotional materials: "From the very beginning, we said I'm the frontman, and you're the guitarist with mystique. That's the dynamic we agreed on!"
RELATED: How Did Ecuador Become the Best Place for Edward Snowden to Hide from America?
According to the Journal, Assange wrote Ecuador's government on Monday to say he hoped he hadn't embarrassed them, apologizing "if we have unwittingly causing Ecuador discomfort in the Snowden matter." (He also held a conference call with reporters that day.) It seems it didn't work. Earlier this week, The Guardian's Rory Carroll and Amanda Holpuch report, "a senior foreign diplomat in Quito told the Guardian that some — though not all — factions in the government were annoyed with what they saw as Assange grandstanding." By Thursday, Correa said in a press conference, "What is the validity of a safe conduct pass issued by a consul in London for someone to leave from Hong Kong to Moscow? None." Assange will be interviewed on ABC News' This Week on Sunday.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WSET) -- Jason Kessler, who helped organize the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville this past August, says he's applied for a new permit for next August at Charlottesville's Emancipation Park on August 11 and 12, 2018.
It's the one year anniversary of the 'Unite the Right' rally.
Jason Kessler organized the the rally to demonstrate against moving a statue of confederate general Robert e. Lee from a city park. The rally drew hundreds of counterprotesters and led to multiple fights and at least 15 people were injured. A woman was killed and 19 were injured after a car drove through a crowd of people protesting the rally.
"First, let me explain why I'm doing this," he . "I simply will not allow these bastards to use the one year anniversary of the Charlottesville government violating a federal judge's order and the US Constitution, in conjunction with violent Antifa groups, to further demonize our activists."
He says next year's rally will be different.
Last year, he said he was "just coming into my own as an event organizer and had faith in the Charlottesville Police Department to abide by the terms of the security arrangement and keep hostile groups separate."
"Whereas I once took it in good faith that authorities were keeping the security arrangements secret so that hostile groups like Antifa would not learn of the plans and therefore create a security risk, I now understand that they did that to screw us over. They did it to ENABLE the Antifa to attack us while claiming that WE actually screwed things up by not following the security plan," Kessler wrote.
In 2018, Kessler said he and his attornies are demanding police release security arrangements to the public in advance so all parties, both demonstrators and counter-demonstrators, know what is expected of them.
He said counter-demonstrators will be required to be behind barricades and not attacking people on the way into the event and will not be allowed to be armed or wear masks.
Kessler is to keep him from organizing future rallies.
"Now I have a real legal team that is committed to vigorously defending our constitutional rights. When Charlottesville rejects my permit, as I fully expect them to, we will push back. My attorney will not allow the government actors to do any secretive shenanigans to screw us over either," he wrote. "The rally will be orchestrated precisely with clear instructions for where everyone is supposed to and allowed to go. And this bullshit where they are afraid to remove armed Antifa from the front of the venue will not fly this time around."
Kessler then went on to explain how this rally would be different from last year, saying it would be better organized and he would have the right resources on hand to make sure it happened the way he wants it to.
He also said he would encourage rally attendees to be more sincere and less "LARPy" to "save people from cultural and ethnic genocide."
"We have to help awaken the ethnic consciousness of White Middle America so that they can stand up for their own interests before It's too late. That is the number one priority. Any LARPing beyond that is unnecessary," Kessler wrote.
He also said he didn't want "our enemies" to turn the anniversary of the day "they violated our rights" into a "propaganda victory," saying thye would smear and distort what acutally happened on August 12, 2017.
Heather Heyer was killed during the rally in Charlottesville when a man drove into a crowd of people, but Kessler didn't address that in his post, instead said he had a committment to nonviolence.
He then quoted a Bible verse, Ecclesiastes 3:8, “There is a time for war and a time for peace" and continued with he didn't see that they were in a wartime atmosphere, but it could come to that.
"We are in a time of protest, of demanding civil rights for our people and winning hearts and minds. Our enemies have done such a thorough job indoctrinating the populace that even half of the white population hates themselves, actively works against the interests of their people and believe that the foundation of our nation is illegitimate because we “stole” our lands during the age of exploration and conquest," Kessler added.
He said he's out to prove they are the good guys.
This is a developing story, check back for updates.
I remember hearing someone I know try to explain rationality to his friends.
He started with “It's important to have correct beliefs. You might think this is obvious, but think about creationists and homeopaths and people who think the moon landing was a hoax.” And then further on in this vein.
And I thought: “NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!”
I will make a confession. Every time someone talks about the stupidity of creationists, moon-hoaxers, and homeopaths, I cringe.
It's not that moon-hoaxers, homeopaths et al aren't dumb. They are. It's not even that these people don't do real harm. They do.
What annoys me about the people who harp on moon-hoaxing and homeopathy – without any interest in the rest of medicine or space history – is that it seems like an attempt to Other irrationality.
It's saying “Look, over here! It's irrational people, believing things that we can instantly dismiss as dumb. Things we feel no temptation, not one bit, to believe. It must be that they are defective and we are rational.”
But to me, the rationality movement is about Self-ing irrationality.
It is about realizing that you, yes you, might be wrong about the things that you're most certain of, and nothing can save you except maybe extreme epistemic paranoia.
Talking about moon-hoaxers and homeopaths too much, at least the way we do it, is counterproductive to this goal. Throw examples of obviously stupid false beliefs at someone, and they start thinking all false beliefs are obvious. Give too many examples of false beliefs that aren't tempting to them, and they start believing they're immune to temptation.
And it raises sloppiness to a virtue.
Take homeopathy. I can't even count the number of times I've heard people say: “Homeopaths don't realize beliefs require evidence. No study anywhere has ever found homeopathy to be effective!”
But of course dozens of studies have found homeopathy to be effective.
“Well, sure, but they weren't double-blind! What you don't realize is that there can be placebo effects from…”
But of course many of these studies have been large double-blinded randomized controlled trials, or even meta-analyses of such.
“Okay, but not published in reputable journals.”
Is The Lancet reputable enough for you?
“But homeopaths don't even realize that many of their concoctions don't contain even a single molecule of active substance!”
But of course almost all homeopaths realize this and their proposed mechanism for homeopathic effects not only survives this criticism but relies upon it.
“But all doctors and biologists agree that homeopathy doesn't work!”
Have you ever spent the five seconds it would take to look up a survey of what percent of doctors and biologists believe homeopathy doesn't work? Or are you just assuming that's true because someone on your side told you so and it seems right?
I am of course being mean here. Being open-minded to homeopaths – reading all the research carefully, seeking out their own writings so you don't accidentally straw-man them, double-checking all of your seemingly “obvious” assumptions – would be a waste of your time.
And someone who demands that you be open-minded about homeopathy would not be your friend. They would probably be a shill for homeopathy and best ignored.
But this is exactly the problem!
The more we concentrate on homeopathy, and moon hoaxes, and creationism – the more people who have never felt any temptation towards these beliefs go through the motions of “debunk”-ing them a hundred times to one another for fun – the more we are driving home the message that these are a representative sample of the kinds of problems we face.
And the more we do that, the more we are training people to make the correct approach to homeopathy – ignoring poor research and straw men on your own side while being very suspicious of anyone who tells us to be careful – their standard approach to any controversy.
And then we get people believing all sorts of shoddy research – because after all, the world is divided between things like homeopathy that Have Never Been Supported By Any Evidence Ever, and things like conventional medicine that Have Studies In Real Journals And Are Pushed By Real Scientists.
Or losing all subtlety and moderation in their political beliefs, never questioning their own side's claims, because the world is divided between People Like Me Who Know The Right Answer, and Shills For The Other Side Who Tell Me To Be Open-Minded As Part Of A Trap.
This post was partly inspired by Gruntled and Hinged's You Probably Don't Want Peer-Reviewed Evidence For God. But there's another G&H post that got me thinking even more.
Inoculation is when you use a weak pathogen like cowpox to build immunity against a stronger pathogen like smallpox. The inoculation effect in psychology is when a person, upon being presented with several weak arguments against a proposition, becomes immune to stronger arguments against the same position.
Tell a religious person that Christianity is false because Jesus is just a blatant ripoff of the warrior-god Mithras and they'll open up a Near Eastern history book, notice that's not true at all, and then be that much more skeptical of the next argument against their faith. “Oh, atheists. Those are those people who think stupid things like Jesus = Mithras. I already figured out they're not worth taking seriously.” Except on a deeper level that precedes and is immune to conscious thought.
So we take the intelligent Internet-reading public, and we throw a bunch of incredibly dumb theories at them – moon-hoaxism, homeopathy, creationism, anti-vaxxing, lizard people, that one guy who thought the rapture would come a couple years ago, whatever. And they are easily debunked, and the stuff you and all your friends believed was obviously true is, in fact, obviously true, and any time you spent investigating whether you were wrong is time you wasted.
And I worry that we are vaccinating people against reading the research for themselves instead of trusting smarmy bloggers who talk about how stupid the other side is.
That we are vaccinating people against thinking there might be important truths on both sides of an issue.
That we are vaccinating people against understanding how “scientific evidence” is a really complicated concept, and that many things that are in peer-reviewed journals will later turn out to be wrong.
That we are vaccinating people against the idea that many theories they find absurd or repugnant at first will later turn out to be true, because nature doesn't respect our feelings.
That we are vaccinating people against doubt.
And maybe this is partly good. It's probably a good idea to trust your doctor and also a good idea to trust your climatologist, and rare is the field where I would feel comfortable challenging expert consensus completely.
But there's also this problem of hundreds of different religions and political ideologies, and most people are born into ones that are at least somewhat wrong. That makes this capacity for real doubt – doubting something even though all your family and friends is telling you it's obviously true and you must be an idiot to question it at all – a tremendously important skill. It's especially important for the couple of rare individuals who will be in a position to cause a paradigm shift in a science by doubting one of its fundamental assumptions.
I don't think that reading about lizard people or creationism will affect people's ability to distinguish between, let's say, cyclic universe theory versus multiverse theory, or other equally dispassionate debates.
But if ever you ever need to have a true crisis of faith, then any time you spend thinking about homeopathy and moon hoaxes beyond the negligible effect they have on your life will be time spent learning exactly the wrong mental habits.
Scott Greer, author and Daily Caller columnist, joined Tucker Carlson on Fox News Friday night to discuss his new book on college radicalism called “No Campus for White Men.”
Carlson was acutely aware of the changing face of higher education in America. “In the last five years or so campuses seem to have been hit by a fever they haven't experienced since the 1950s,” he said.
“Millions of students and professors have made far-left politics their only reason for being at school. The result is this: everybody gets a safe space expect for white men. They are hated and despised,” he continued, introducing Greer.
Greer lamented the state of campus politics today, pointing to a near complete takeover by the radical left. “Identity politics and victimhood culture have taken over higher education,” he explained. “More important in some ways is victimhood culture, where everyone competes to be the biggest victim.”
The problem, as Greer sees it, is the complete dominance of the leftist moral outlook on university campuses. “The reason that they do that is we assign moral status in the college moral culture that's being created to who's the bigger victim,” he explained, “If you're privileged, that's the worst thing you can be.”
WATCH:
In a not-so-shocking turn of events, it turns out that robots are very good at mechanical tasks, and humans are overconfident in their driving abilities.
A new study from the AAA put human drivers who considered themselves adept at parallel parking in a “park-off” against five models of self-parking cars. The result? Human drivers got absolutely destroyed by the automated cars in a test of basic parking skills.
Nearly 80% of survey respondents contacted by the AAA said they were “confident in their parallel parking abilities.” But self-parking cars hit the curb 81% less often than human drivers in the road test, and parked themselves with 47% fewer maneuvers. Self-parking cars were also able to park 37% closer to the curb than human drivers, and—to add insult to injury—they did it 10% faster than the humans.
“Self-parking technology outperformed manual parking in number of curb strikes, number of maneuvers, speed and accuracy,” said Megan McKernan, manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California's Automotive Research Center, in a press release announcing the survey results. “While Americans report feeling confident in their parallel parking abilities, this technology proves there is room for improvement.”
“Park assist,” as self-parking car technology is often called, is currently standard on some high-end models. The AAA tested a 2015 Lincoln MKC, a 2015 Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, a 2015 Cadillac CTS-V Sport, a 2015 BMW i3 and a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Limited.
Safety experts are generally fans of automation in automobiles, and for good reason—studies show that 90% of crashes are caused by human error. Self-driving cars are already safer than human drivers, and the only collisions involving self-driving cars thus far have been caused by humans. While self-parking systems aren't perfect, neither are the humans who routinely cause fender benders in grocery store parking lots.
Hilariously, despite being shellacked by robots in the test, only one in four humans surveyed by the AAA said they would trust self-parking technology to take control of their vehicle. Keep the faith, guys! And don't mind me, while I let this robot keep my bumper scratch-free.
The president says he's ready for this week's Sona despite an ailing economy & threats the EFF will disrupt.
PRETORIA - President Jacob Zuma says he is ready for the State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday and he's confident South Africans are pleased with his performance.
The president made the comments after a walk-about in Marabastad, Pretoria, today where he spoke to hawkers, produce market traders and foreigners at the Home Affairs office.
Zuma says he wanted to talk to people to get ideas for his address later this week.
This year's Sona looks set to be the president's toughest, with an ailing economy and threats from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to disrupt proceedings.
He appeared relaxed and confident and told reporters he was ready for Thursday's address.

He says people are happy with government's performance, contrary to what is being reported in the media.
"They are happy with the president. Everything they could say… all of that was important for me because at times you know you guys [the media] write from other sources. This was a direct source."
The president says he'll convey some of the complaints he's heard at Home Affairs office today to the relevant ministers to address.
The White House is preparing to redirect Justice Department resources toward investigating universities over “race-based discrimination” against white applicants. Recent PRRI polling reveals stark divides on who faces discrimination in the U.S. today.
Nearly six in ten (58 percent) Americans say black people face a lot of discrimination in American society today, while only three in ten (30 percent) say the same of white people. More Americans now say blacks face a considerable degree of discrimination in U.S. society than in 2013 when slightly more than half (52 percent) of the public expressed this view.
Racial, ethnic, and class divides on this issue follow expected patterns. Nearly nine in ten (87 percent) black Americans say black people face a lot discrimination, but only 19 percent say the same is true of whites. Approximately half (49 percent) of whites say blacks face discrimination, while just over one-third (34 percent) say the same of whites. Class divisions among whites are notable. While whites with a college degree mirror the population overall, whites without a college degree are about equally likely to believe that blacks (44 percent) and whites (39 percent) face a great deal of discrimination. Hispanics do not differ substantially from the general population on this issue.
Notably, Republicans are significantly more likely to say whites, rather than blacks, experience a lot of discrimination in the U.S. today (43 percent vs. 27 percent, respectively). Democrats and independents are far more likely to say blacks experience a lot of discrimination than to say the same about whites (82 percent vs. 19 percent and 59 percent vs. 30 percent, respectively). The partisan gap in perceptions of discrimination against blacks has increased substantially over the last four years, driven primarily by shifts among Democrats. In 2013, about two-thirds (66 percent) of Democrats compared to roughly one-third (32 percent) of Republicans expressed the view that discrimination against blacks in the U.S. is common. Notably, white and nonwhite Democrats recorded nearly identical changes in opinion.

Is online marketplace eBay really protecting the interests of its users? It claims to take action in 30,000 cases each month when something goes wrong and users are out of pocket.
Yet after Telegraph Money reported on a case where the online giant's user protection systems failed to help one reader, others were quick to comment and email about similar poor – and sometimes costly – experiences.
This was launched last year, and promises to refund the buyer with the cost of an item if it does not arrive or is not as described. If such a refund is made the seller has the money deducted from their account.
But eBay's protection policies appear to be failing. Last week we reported how Matthew Wright had lost £160 and was locked out of eBay indefinitely after he sold a phone to a buyer in Hungary who claimed they had not received the item.
This resulted in eBay automatically refunding the buyer under the guarantee scheme and passing the cost back to Mr Wright, without investigating the matter. Ebay later waived the fee – but failed to explain adequately why it had been so quick to favour the buyer.
Helen Hickman (pictured above) suffered a similar experience. Mrs Hickman, 53, uses eBay to sell surplus stock from her baby shop in Buckinghamshire.
Having never had any problems with selling before, she had gained a great “feedback” score. This is the score, calculated by the website that is based on users' transactions with each other.
Last month, however, Mrs Hickman encountered her first troublesome buyer. After selling a brand-new, sealed pushchair for £199.99, she received an automated message from eBay nine days later stating that the buyer wanted to return the pushchair because she “didn't need it any more”. This was just within the 14-day period during which a buyer can receive a refund – provided that the goods are in the same condition as when sold.
“Items described as 'new in box' must be returned in original, unopened packaging,” eBay states.
Another automated message from eBay a few days later was sent to Mrs Hickman stating that the buyer had to be refunded, despite the fact that Mrs Hickman had yet to receive the returned pushchair.
After calling eBay to dispute its insistence that she should pay without having received the item, eBay said it would investigate the matter.
The following day Mrs Hickman received the returned pushchair “covered in mud, with stones in the tyres and baby sick on the fabric.”
The pushchair was returned with suspicious looking stains on it
After receiving the damaged goods, she took pictures and spent more than two hours on the phone trying to get through to eBay to explain things.
Several phone calls later, and after a promise from eBay to “elevate the appeal”, the buyer was refunded in full, with the money taken from Mrs Hickman's PayPal account.
Five days later, the case was formally closed in favour of the buyer.
Like many who use eBay, Mrs Hickman said her frustrations really began when she needed to make contact with someone within the organisation.
Many complain that eBay's systems appear designed to prevent people making contact or complaining.
Through sheer determination Mrs Hickman eventually got through to someone who said he was “shocked” by her story and said he would help her.
Mysteriously, she got her money back a few days later. As in the case of Mr Wright, it is not clear what prompted the payment – or whether the buyer was forced to pay after all.
“I've had a horrendous experience with eBay and I will not be selling there any more,” Mrs Hickman said.
When contacted by Telegraph Money, a spokesman for eBay said: “As a marketplace, we do not have physical possession of the item at any time, so we have to use the information we have available in order to make fair decisions.”
The spokesman added that eBay had invested “millions of pounds” and dedicated thousands of people to ensuring that buyers and sellers could trade safely on its marketplace.
“We regret that in this case we did not live up to our usual high standards,” he said. “We do have to make difficult decisions that balance the interests of both parties, and we are sorry to hear of these isolated cases.”

Image copyright PA Image caption HMS Westminster is due to pass through Gibraltar's territorial waters before heading for the Middle East
A Royal Navy warship is to pay a "routine" visit to Gibraltar, the UK government has said, amid a continuing row with Spain over border checks.
Relations between Gibraltar and Spain have deteriorated in recent weeks.
But the Ministry of Defence said the visit was "long-planned" and one of many "regular and routine deployments".
HMS Westminster, accompanied by two auxiliary ships, makes up part of a task force which is destined for the Middle East.
'Granted permission'
Other warships in the task force will visit ports in Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and Malta.
"Gibraltar is a strategic base for UK defence and as such Royal Navy ships visit its waters throughout the year as part of a range of regular and routine deployments," an MoD spokesman said.
Spain's foreign ministry agreed that the visit was "routine", adding that the UK government had asked for permission to stop over at the Rota naval base, which is near the Strait of Gibraltar in south-west Spain.
"They asked for permission for the operation and in our relationship as allies, we granted it," a Spanish foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters news agency.
On Wednesday, a spokesman said UK Prime Minister David Cameron had raised "serious concerns" with his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy over deteriorating diplomatic relations between the two countries.
The call followed concerns over increased vehicle checks at the border between Spain and Gibraltar causing major delays for tourists and residents.
And the Spanish foreign minister has mooted bringing in a new 50 euro (£43) fee on every vehicle entering or leaving the British territory.
The checks followed a decision by Gibraltar to drop 70 concrete blocks into the sea into disputed waters just off its coast, which Gibraltarian authorities said would create an artificial reef and encourage sea life to flourish.
The Spanish government has accused Gibraltar of laying the blocks "without the necessary authorisation" in "waters that are not theirs", contravening environmental laws and damaging Spain's fishing industry.
A tale of two parties.
The most interesting non-partisan split is whites by educational level. Those with college degrees say white supremacists are the bigger threat, 55/36. Whites without a college degree? 52/31 say it's the media. Another interesting detail: Nonwhites, the people with the most to fear from white supremacists, are less likely to say they're more of a threat than the media than Democrats generally are. Dems split 76/12; nonwhite voters split 62/24. If you doubt that this question is being interpreted through a partisan lens, ruminate on that.
The left-wing take on the Republican split is, of course, that right-wingers are hopelessly racist and consumed with media bias, leading to a wild distortion in prioritizing threats to America. The right-wing reply is that white supremacism is, by and large, a movement of fringe kooks with no real power over anything. They're capable of lethal violence, as was true in Charlottesville, but mostly they prance around with mosquito torches muttering about Jews. The media, meanwhile, is ubiquitous, capable of building narratives that threaten Trump's presidency, and overwhelmingly biased against the right. If you view elite-neoliberal conventional wisdom of the sort cherished by the press as a threat to America, and both the right and some on the left do, then obviously you worry more about them than you do whatever Richard Spencer's farting out today on Twitter.
Although racial attitudes do, of course, inform the answer to this question. Relatedly:
Democrats are rock solid in their feelings, Republicans are more equivocal. But it stands to reason that if you think minorities are favored over whites on balance, you're not up at night worrying about white supremacists threatening the country.
Here's an interesting point of consensus, though. When asked who Trump thinks is the bigger threat to America, the parties align:
The Trump-friendly spin on that is that the question's really a referendum on Trump's relationship with the press, not his views on white supremacists. As the president makes clear every day, there's nothing he hates more than the “fake news media.” (There's nothing he loves more than the media either, of course, except maybe Ivanka.) Give people a choice between the media and literally anything else — famine, cancer, Rosie O'Donnell — in terms of the things Trump hates the most and they'll say “the media.” The less Trump-friendly spin is that even his own party has come to the conclusion that, while he might find white supremacists distasteful, they palpably don't make him angry the way the media does. And why would they? Trump seems to measure political entities mainly in terms of how pro- or anti-Trump they are. The media is stridently anti-Trump; white supremacists are pretty pro. Of course he's going to see the former as more of a threat to America than the latter. They're a much bigger threat to him personally!
(CN) – Southwest Airlines and 19 other passenger air carriers can not dispute how the Transportation Security Administration determines the amount of security fees it charges them for passenger and baggage screening, a federal appeals court has decided.
In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration placed the TSA in charge of a dramatically heightened airport screening process, but in doing so said that the fees for this new security must never exceed the amount that airlines paid for screening passengers and property during the year 2000.
But trying to determine the figure for that year has long been a point of contention.
In a petition for review of orders issued by the TSA, Southwest and the other airlines argued that the agency's methodology for determining the fees was “arbitrary and capricious” and also unconstitutional.
However two members of a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit disagreed, finding that the TSA's data report inquiry process was chosen “with good reason, and certainly sufficient reason”.
This is the second time this case has appeared in the appeals court. In 2009, the airlines protested that a fee increase implemented by the TSA was based on an inaccurate screening report from the Congress appointed Government Accountability Office
The agency was found guilty of miscalculating its fees and was required to recalculate and refund the airlines accordingly. The airlines insist that TSA's recalculations “fall short of the total amount due to the airlines”, potentially hundreds of millions short.
But writing for a panel majority that included himself and Circuit Judge Karen L. Henderson, Circuit Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh said, “Determining the figure in response to this Court's remand thus involved a good deal of inquiry and ultimately required a dash of art as well as science”.
Circuit Judge Janice R. Brown dissented on what she herself described as narrow but decisive grounds.
Brown was alarmed by the fact that when the TSA calculated passenger and baggage screening costs for the year 2000, it failed to consider another agency's estimate of the total number of people screened that year.
“Notwithstanding the Airlines' protestations, neither TSA nor the consultant whose analysis it relied on even mentioned that critical data,” she wrote. “Although TSA's calculation of the security fee is entitled to broad deference, the agency's discretion is not unlimited.”
In addition to Southwest Airlines, other airlines involved in the case included American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Air Lines and US Airways. Their case was argued by Roy Goldberg of Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton of Washington, D.C.

Apple has quietly updated its CarPlay microsite which explains the feature to add CBS News Radio to its growing list of apps it grants CarPlay support to, but a bigger change also appears on the CarPlay site this morning. Apple is no longer promising CarPlay support from any automobile manufacturer this year as it has done since its debut in March. While there has been no shortage of CarPlay demoes and availability announcements, actually getting your hands on a model with CarPlay thus far has proven almost impossible.
The site now says CarPlay “will be available” from listed partners without offering any specific timeframe (and removing the 2014 language for specific brands altogether). This is likely due to delays in CarPlay availability thus far, even in models that have announced support earlier this year with cars that are now on the road.
To date, it appears Ferrari's FF model is the only vehicle to actually ship CarPlay to customers. Automakers Mercedes-Benz and Volvo both confirmed to 9to5Mac last month that despite Apple announcing each company as 2014 partners, CarPlay availability would not happen this year.
Before today's change, Apple's CarPlay availability included Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo, saying “CarPlay will be available on models from these great marques in 2014.”
You can see Apple's previous CarPlay availability description below:
The updated site now consolidates a number of brands under the same parent company adding to the vagueness of when and if CarPlay will be available in specific vehicles.
Aside from availability in new models, CarPlay has been promised in aftermarket in-car displays as well with Apple listing both Pioneer and Alpine as committed partners. That language has not changed, but Pioneer stated earlier this year that CarPlay would be available in summer 2014 (later adding early summer availability), but Pioneer customers still have not seen the mentioned firmware update to bring CarPlay support from Apple.
Apple first introduced CarPlay as “iOS in the Car” at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June 2013, and rebranded and redesigned the feature under the name CarPlay in March 2014.
Update: Pioneer UK has a couple of interesting tweets about CarPlay support and releasing the firmware update mentioned before.

Learning a new videogame can be frustrating. But for kids with disabilities, the experience can be especially hard. If you can't play what the other kids are playing, it's like being picked last for the kickball team.
Take Giddeon, whom the AbleGamers Foundation met at one of their "Accessibility Arcades" in Atlantic City, New Jersey. According to the AbleGamers Foundation website, Giddeon didn't want to play any games. A rare disease had stunted the growth of his arms. Only a few fingers had formed. Holding a game controller was tough.
Already, too many kids with disabilities feel like they're being left out of all the fun. For Giddeon, the experience of not being able to play the game could have been a minor encounter with low self-esteem, or a major lesson in humiliation.
But after encouragement from the AbleGamers staff, Giddeon used an "accessible controller" called the Adroit with the racing game Forza 3. "Within seconds he was racing past the competition and smiling brightly at his newfound driving skills," the AbleGamers Foundation website said. "By the end of that day he was coming in first place in every race."
Thanks to adaptive technology, Giddeon had gone from being unable to play a videogame to becoming a racing champion – and a gamer.
Now the AbleGamers Foundation, long dedicated to bring greater accessibility in the digital entertainment space for people of all ages, has launched the AbleGamers 2012 Children's Grant Program, a one-time grant that provides gaming equipment for children 15 years or younger.
"We are thrilled to be enabling children with disabilities by providing assistive technology through this grant," said Mark Barlet, president and founder of the AbleGamers Foundation. "Our supporters are wonderful. Without the amazing and continued support of generous donors, this wouldn't be possible."
Applications are now being accepted for kids to receive one piece of assistive technology, courtesy of the AbleGamers Foundation, so that they might, can "gain a greater quality of life, and develop a rich social life that gaming can bring," AbleGamers said.
The grants might fund hardware and accessible controllers from major assistive technology makers, as well as software. Accessibility technology enables play on most major game systems, including Nintendo's Wii, Microsoft's Xbox 360, Sony's PlayStation 3, and personal computers.
Parents and caregivers can apply for the grant here. The deadline is fast approaching – Aug. 31. You can learn more about the foundation on its website. Its Facebook page is loaded with photos of accessibility arcades. You can also donate to AbleGamers.
Kids deserve to feel normal, powerful and able to participate in the culture, which for so many revolves around gaming. Kids with disabilities, AbleGamers said, "just want to have fun despite [the] many serious challenges disability can bring."
On March 8, 1979, 100,000 Iranian women marched in protest against new laws that had just been passed which made the hijab compulsory for all women. In 1982 the law would be extended to girls as young as six. Before the Iranian revolution, women in Iran looked like women in the West. The hijab and the niqab are modern inventions conceived as the outward expression of an anti-West, fundamentalist strain of Islam, bent on global triumphalism.
Not every woman who wears cover today is aware of its history or its political baggage. Many well-intentioned women mistakenly believe they are merely conforming to standards of modesty prescribed by their religion. Nevertheless, the political baggage is there.
The hijab has become well tolerated, if not approved by all, in western life. But the niqab has not.
Face covers cause justifiable tension with regard to security, but also spark social fears that cannot be easily defined. Our public spaces, like ecological habitats, are more fragile than they appear. The introduction of a foreign component that impinges on western (and once universal) norms of human interaction can erode their health.

As many European nations have discovered, the adoption of full covers by a critical mass of women has indeed eroded the presumption of social trust and civic reciprocity Europeans used to feel when their societies were more culturally homogenous. Many countries have, as a result, adopted full or partial bans on face cover.
History of Bans
A law proscribing full face cover, for example, has just come into force in Austria, with the goal of “ensuring the cohesion of society,” a sentiment reflected in similar bans in Belgium, Bulgaria, Italy (where, since 1975, it has been illegal to cover one's face in public), as well as Norway and other Scandinavian countries (Denmark and Sweden allow schools, administrations and companies to decide for themselves). France, where politicized veiling is particularly intense, instituted a full ban on cover in 2011.
In response to these bans, protesters have twice pursued legal challenges to them on human rights grounds. And twice the European Court of Human Rights has upheld the bans, rejecting “religious freedom” arguments.
The judges – from Belgium, Iceland, Estonia, Turkey, Montenegro, Monaco and Moldova – found the ban did not break rules within international treaties forbidding discrimination. The European Court of Human Rights is part of the 47-member Council of Europe to which Britain still belongs, even after Brexit.
These European decisions will be something for the Canadian government and the Supreme Court of Canada to consider, as they normally do, if a Charter challenge should arise with regard to Bill 62.
Bill 62
Bill 62 is a “religious neutrality” law passed into force by Quebec's majority-Liberal government, which will ban face covers in the giving and getting of public services.
Quebec's decision was not precipitate; rather, it has been long under review. In 2010, Bill 94 was proposed by the Liberals, and had the exact same motivation as Bill 62. As Quebec's then-immigration minister Yolande James forthrightly put it at the time, “if you want to integrate into Quebec society, here are our values. We want to see your face.”
Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard echoed her sentiment last week when he said of Bill 62, “We are in a free and democratic society. You speak to me, I should see your face, and you should see mine. It's as simple as that.”
For most Quebecers, who are culturally confident and therefore not nearly so steeped in political correctness as the Rest of Canada (ROC), it actually is “as simple as that.” Both Bill 94 (which died with a change in government) and Bill 62 have therefore received overwhelming support in Quebec.
It is not Islamophobia that fuels Quebecers' enthusiasm for the face cover law (nobody today is, after all, clamouring for a hijab ban). Two aspects of Quebec culture, which distinguish it from the ROC, can explain the support. First, in Quebec, the social ideal is modeled on the French principle of the full secularization of public life in the interest of “vivre ensemble” (living together) with minimal friction. A level social playing field is therefore privileged over the individual's right to practice customs that impede social reciprocity, which the niqab certainly does.
(I should say here that Bill 62 goes too far in extending the ban to public transportation, where there is no social interaction with others. Apart from identifying herself to the driver, there is no “vivre ensemble” need so pressing that the state should force a woman to remain uncovered during the journey any more than when she is walking down the street, even if full face exposure at all times is a worthy ideal.)
Quebec Feminism
The second aspect is Quebec feminism. It is a powerful force here, even more visibly so than in ROC. However, perhaps because of Quebec's cultural singularity, feminists here adhere more to feminism's original premises of true equality for all women, regardless of cultural provenance, than the current wave of feminists does elsewhere.
In its latest “intersectional” iteration, feminism elsewhere has adopted what public intellectual Phyllis Chesler calls “faux feminism.” Chesler writes: “Women's studies associations, national feminist organizations…are not merely ‘politically correct'; they have become ‘Islamically correct.' They are currently more concerned with the religious sanctity of head and face veiling than they are with FGM, forced face-veiling, honor-based violence, polygamy, child marriage, and honor killing in the West.”
Chesler is correct. Canadian feminists are comfortable banning from political life those men and women who are pro-life on religious grounds, arguing that such Christian beliefs are degrading to women. Thus, the sanctimony of those who are calling out Bill 62 as racist or Islamophobic is especially galling for its hypocrisy, not to mention insulting to the millions of Muslim women in Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia who yearn to throw off their veils, but cannot—who yearn for gender equality, but have no voice to demand it.
Few Wearers
Relatively few women wear face covers at the moment in Quebec, an argument often adduced in opposing bans. But few women wore face covers in Europe 20 years ago; and then, as niqabs and burkas became normalized, largely for political reasons, they were everywhere. Their experience counsels the precautionary principle as the prudent course, while such a law is easy to enforce.
By taking a stand—at least in the taxpayer-funded institutions of public life for which it is responsible—the Quebec government has done the right thing.
Bill 62 makes a socially wholesome statement: Diversity can be our strength, but only when both individual rights and communal responsibilities find equilibrium in the public forum. Bill 62 is a welcome sign that the 100,000 Iranian women who marched to protest their loss of human rights in 1979 did not march in vain.

Anxiety over the Election Is Mirroring Anxiety over Football
If there is one thing just about every single American can agree on, it is that we all cannot wait for this election to be over. In fact, a recent poll found that four out of five Americans wish it was over and nearly three-fourths said the election is causing stress. This disillusionment with our political system is creating crippling distrust in our political leaders and the mass media we rely on for information.
I think a similar disillusionment is permeating the sport of football, exhibited most pointedly in the much-discussed decline in television ratings. A regular dose of negative headlines about domestic violence, drug use, race relations, and concussions, combined with the perception of abusive and inconsistent use of league authority has created a similar sense of disillusionment regarding football that is so obvious in our political system.
Of course, football used to be a sanctuary for fans — a place where they could escape the anxieties of work and politics. But now, many of the same issues they face outside of football are becoming part of the sport's daily narrative. With their sanctuary corrupted, frustration boils and disillusionment takes root.
Nothing demonstrates this frustration among fans more than their reactions on social media when players, coaches, or folks in sports media speak out about any of these pertinent issues, which is usually in the form of #StickToSports. Of course, nothing precludes an athlete or sports reporter from talking about these things. We would never tell someone else to #StickToNursing, #StickToTeaching, or #StickToPlumbing. Our opinions matter just like everyone else's.
But I understand their frustration. They do not want us addressing these divisive issues because we are corrupting something that is sacred to them. Historically, football provided an escape from these issues, and now it is reflecting them.
Some may argue that this is a good thing; that we, as a society, must confront these ills head on instead of seeking refuge from them. As convenient as it is to avoid serious issues, it is healthier to talk about their existence and what needs to be done to solve them.
Luckily for all of us, the election will soon be over (or at least we can hope). Campaign commercials will no longer be blanketing the airwaves. Profane revelations and vitriolic accusations will no longer dominate headlines every day. And though anxiety over politics may still remain, it will not be as acute as it is today.
But the issues creating this disillusionment around football, however, are not going away on their own. The issue of concussions will remain. There will likely be more cases of domestic violence and drug use. Racial tension will not disappear.
For players, leading by example will be our contribution to the future of our sport, not by staying silent out of fear of backlash or retribution.
We must have open, public, and positive dialogues with each other about issues we find important. We should not expect to resolve all our problems, but we must address them and speak honestly about them. We need to instill the lessons from the locker room and the playing field — having each other's back, no matter our differences or disagreements — in our daily lives and interactions. We need to build a sense of humility — if we win, we celebrate for a few hours and then get to work on preparing for the next game; if we lose, we don't complain about the results or call the game rigged.
Or in other words, look at how are our political leaders have addressed the anxieties around the election (by flaming them), and do the opposite.

With 43 varieties of pillow, 150-year-old bottles of cognac and breathtaking, neon-lit views, no expense is spared for high rollers at the Las Vegas of the East.
At the entrance to the Galaxy casino, elegant Filipina glamour models usher gamblers past a giant model diamond into a world of palm-lined artificial beaches and £48-a-time cocktails. This is Macau, a former Portuguese colony on China's southern coast that in just over a decade has become the undisputed global king of the casino.
It is also a world of money laundering, corruption, human trafficking and over-indulgence that stands in stark contrast to the current austerity campaign being spearheaded by Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Macau returned to Chinese control in 1999, two years after the British handover of neighbouring Hong Kong, and almost immediately set about transforming itself into the global casino capital.
On Friday, it took a step closer to its goal when the Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld announced plans for a 270-room hotel there. Tonight, it will notch up another coup when the Rolling Stones play the 15,000 capacity arenas at the Sands China casino. A sister venue to the Sands casino in Las Vegas, its bosses have also enlisted David Beckham as a “regional ambassador” in the hope that his “well-known personal values” will help.
But while the likes of the Rolling Stones may now be considered the very definition of a clean, family-friendly corporate entertainment, the same cannot yet be said of Macau itself, which is yet to completely throw off its wilder, sleazier side.
Its recent boom, spurred by China's rise as an economic superpower, has brought huge wealth to this tiny colony, which is barely the size of an average London borough.
But it has also attracted an avalanche of problems, including loan sharks, gambling addiction, prostitution, a widening wealth gap and rampant corruption.
Last October a US congressional report cited claims from one local academic that at least “$202billion in ill-gotten funds are channelled through Macau each year”.
Jose Maria Pereira Coutinho, an outspoken local legislator, said that money laundering was rife and hinted that Macau's casinos were at the heart of the problem. “Gaming is like a machine: you put raw rice inside the machine and it comes out white,” he said.
The old Macau is impossible to miss. It is there in the newspaper stories about people-smuggling gangs luring impoverished women from mainland China into brothels and it is there on the pavements, in the discarded fliers on which bikini-clad “multi-national beauties” offer gamblers 24/7 “tendon relaxing” sessions or “charming massages”.
It is there underneath the Hotel Lisboa, one of Macau's oldest casino-hotels, in an underground corridor where young prostitutes in bright red lipstick and almost invisible skirts wait for their next clients.
And it is there in the cramped office of Danny Lau, an evangelical counsellor, who holds weekly support sessions for desperate gamblers – the majority casino employees – who are seeking salvation, often after running up huge debts with loan sharks who demand interest of up to 60 per cent.
“Sometimes I just want to say to them, 'Wake up! Wake up! Don't gamble any more!'” said Mr Lau, who claimed that half of his patients had attempted suicide or had suicidal thoughts.
Mr Coutinho, a pro-democracy legislator, scoffed at Macau's attempts to reinvent itself. “[It is] an illusion. It's what we call a mirage in the desert.”
In 2002, Macau's 339 gaming tables and 808 slot machines brought in about £274million. By last year revenues had hit £27.65billion – seven times more than the Las Vegas Strip.
Some predict that could rise to £65.8billion by 2020, which would be roughly equivalent to the entire annual GDP of oil-rich Angola, or nearly half that of Israel.
But 12 years on from the start of its gambling boom, Macau is now looking to reduce its dependence on VIP “high rollers” and woo families to take their children to see feelgood musicals or ice statues of Shrek and the Kung Fu Panda.
The Rolling Stones follow in the footsteps of Justin Bieber, Celine Dion and Lady Gaga and sports stars including Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.
“[The] old Macau is just a gambling place – [now] it is more a family experience,” said Charles Ngai, a PR man for the City of Dreams casino complex.
“Of course it is still a gambling destination but what the government is trying to project is that it is not just gaming any more.”
But with 10 new casinos to open over the coming decade, Mr Lau is unlikely to find himself short of work.
Each Monday, new members who appear at his clinic in a grease-stained tenement block are greeted by a collage of newspaper cuttings that lays bare the dark side of Macau's gambling boom.
“Borrowed one million. Lost it all. Slit his own throat,” reads one headline taped to the wall, alongside a grisly photograph of the corpse of a gambling debtor.
“New casinos are being built all around the world and the governments think it is a good way of bringing in revenue,” sighed Mr Lau. “But do they really know what the price underneath is?”

The BBC is set to announce plans to withdraw the UK from the Eurovision Song Contest, in a move which will anger and dismay nearly half of all Brits. Plans are afoot for Scotland to compete by itself.
PinkNews understands that the withdrawal will come into effect in the first few months of 2019, meaning the UK will have just two more shots at the trophy.
Eurovision will also not be shown on the BBC past next year, after months of tempestuous negotiations broke down last night.
A source close to BBC director-general Tony Hall said the Prime Minister had forced his hand by instructing the corporation this week to make at least £350,000 in annual cuts.
Hall felt he had no choice but to drastically reduce the BBC's payments into the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)- which the same source said stands at close to £350,000 this year, up from £310,000 in 2010.
However, the EBU insisted that if the UK cut its contribution by more than half, it would no longer gain automatic entry to the final and have to compete in a Eurovision semi-final.
Throughout fraught discussions, which it has emerged first began in June, this was one demand which the BBC consistently refused to agree to.
Professor Kvitnya Duryty, a Ukranian Eurovision expert who has written 50 articles on the subject and teaches courses at Kiev University, said she wasn't surprised by the news.
“The UK has become more and more resentful of taking part in this European endeavour – it has become a joke to many people, and everyone else is indifferent.
“Perhaps now this money can be spent on other things, like health.”
Graham Norton, who hosts the UK's coverage of the event, said he was “distraught and angered” by the news.
“Eurovision will continue to exist, but we won't be in it. It's devastating,” he said.
“The contest is completely ridiculous, but I've loved making fun of it for the last few years, and I'll miss it.”
However, he agreed with the BBC that the UK competing in a semi-final would likely backfire.
“Looking back at the UK's recent Eurovision entries, they wouldn't have a hope or a prayer in a semi-final!
“We'd probably lose to Germany on penalties anyway,” Norton quipped.
The Union flag has zoomed down to 24th in both of the last two years – out of 26 and 27 countries – and has come bottom three times this millennium.
The country's last win came in 1997, with Katrina and the Waves' Love Shine a Light.
But Scott Mills, who commentated on Eurovision semi-finals for BBC Three, said this alone was no reason to withdraw, and that the UK should have agreed to the EBU's terms.
“If we sulked and left every competition we don't win for a while, we'd never play in the World Cup,” he said.
He thought it was a “tragedy” that the UK had pulled out, and vowed to “start my own song contest – even if I have to do it at my local pub!”
An aide to Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP had been in secret talks with STV – which is also a member of the EBU – to ensure that Scotland at least keeps broadcasting the event and for Scotland to have its own entry. It is understood that in a rare sign of cross-party unity Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale are supportive of the idea.
A source close to Ruth Davidson said that there is even talk about a referendum on whether Scotland should rejoin Eurovision.
62% of BBC One viewer in Scotland watched Eurovision last year compared to 48% across the whole of the United Kingdom.
Consumers around the world no longer want to buy Japanese cars
Japan's exports saw a record plunge in February, falling by nearly half compared with a year earlier, according to the country's finance ministry.
Exports fell 49.4% year-on-year to 3.526tn yen ($36bn; £24.6bn), though this was in line with forecasts.
The latest data comes after figures for January showed year-on-year exports nearly halved that month as well.
The world's second-largest economy is suffering in the downturn as demand for its products has collapsed.
Exports are important for Japan, so the global downturn is affecting the country particularly badly, according to the BBC's Tokyo correspondent Roland Buerk.
Surplus
"Japanese growth was exclusively dependent on exports," said Professor Noriko Hama at Doshisha Business School in Kyoto.
"It was natural that Japan would be hit a lot more severely than other countries."
Car exports dropped more than 70% for February. Car firms are cutting jobs and reducing shifts in response to slowing demand.
But on the upside, Japan's trade balance was in surplus in February after a record deficit in January, because the decline in exports was offset by a sharp fall in imports, which were 43% lower for the month.
This surplus last month, which reached 82.4bn yen ($841m), was the first in five months.
Japan, which is officially in recession, saw its economy contract by an annualised 12.1% in the last three months of 2008, the biggest contraction among developed countries.
The government is working on a third stimulus package, which local media reports have estimated will be worth 20 trillion yen.
It seems straight out from a Hollywood sci-fi movie, but an intelligent suit that shows a person's health status in real time recently came to life in China.
The suit, reminiscent of Kitai's (Jaden Smith) in the 2013 film “After Earth,” was unveiled by Wang Zhonglin at the third International Conference on Nanoenergy and Nanosystems in Beijing on Oct. 21 – 23.
Fitted with large sensors made of woven material, the suit is capable of detecting blood pressure, chemical balance, temperature and other health status indicators, China News reported.
It also comes with a self-charging pacemaker that “doesn't need recharging or replacement.”
Wang, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Natural Sciences, expects the new invention to go on sale in two to three years.
He also introduced “nano tattoos” — stickers that administer medications straight to a person's veins, China Daily noted. This painless and private injection method is expected to help diabetic patients.
The new inventions are made possible by an innovation called triboelectric nanogenerator, which harvests mechanical energy and transforms it into electric signals. In essence, it collects the energy a person produces when he/she engages in physical activities such as walking.
With this technology, the suit can also send a person's health status to computers and mobile devices, allowing physicians to monitor them even without their physical presence.
Nanogenerators, however, are not entirely new things. They are currently used to power many portable devices, as well as shoes, suits, bicycles and carpets. Wang added:
“Nanogenerating carpets, in particular, will be able to detect irregular movements, so that when someone trips and falls, it will automatically sound an alert and solicit help.”
In praise of China's contribution to nanoscience, Ashutosh Tiwari, secretary-general of the International Association of Advanced Materials, said at the conference:
“China has surpassed the US and ranks first in the field of nanoenergy. Thanks to the hard work of Chinese scientists around the world, it now produces 50 percent of academic publications every year. But how to synchronize it into applications, that's a question to think about.”
MIAMI (CBSMiami) – A teacher at a Seventh-day Adventist school in North Miami is accused of sexually molesting a minor.
Mwon Taylor, 39, has been charged with five counts of sexual battery and 15 counts of lewd/lascivious molestation on a child between 12 and 16 years of age, according to the North Miami Police Department spokeswoman Natalie Buissereth.
Taylor teaches at Miami Union Academy, at 12600 NW 4TH Avenue. It's a private school for students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade.
On Wednesday the school's principal Renée P. Hodge issued a statement concerning Taylor's arrest.
“It came to our attention that an alleged incident occurred involving a former student of Miami Union Academy and a faculty member. We are deeply sadden and regret to hear this news. We do not condone inappropriate behaviors of any sort, and are very protective of our students. Be assured that the school's administration is in complete cooperation with the authorities and their investigation.”
The girl came forward recently with her mother and reportedly told police about several incidents which happened when she was 14 years old and in eighth grade at the school.
“The victim was forced to perform oral sex on him and he also performed it on her,” said Buissereth. “When adults have sex with a child it is not consensual.”
Police say the victim said there were a total of 20 inappropriate encounters with Taylor when she was in the 8th and 9th grade and five of them were sexually explicit.
She told police Taylor first started exhibiting strange behavior when he was taking photographs of her feet.
A police report says “the approximately 15 inappropriate but not explicitly sexual encounters included Mr. Taylor grabbing buttocks and rubbing his hands in genital areas between classes and after school over clothing.”
The girl told police the acts were consensual and happened at a number of places including outside Taylor's apartment, at a Greyhound bus station and even inside a classroom.
Detectives say most of the encounters happened at the school.
Police suspect there may be other victims.
“This occurred in 2011 and 2012, and now we are in 2016, so you know there are a lot of kids at that school at this time,” said Buissereth. “So we want to get the message out. If anyone has any information about this case, or maybe could have been a victim themselves, they need to contact us.”
Taylor is currently being held on no bond.
He refused to appear in bond court on Thursday and the case was reset for Friday.
Taylor lives in a home in Hollywood and neighbors were surprised to hear about the charges.
“It was nothing out of the ordinary,” said Rosa Negron, a neighbor of Taylor's. “He seemed like a good guy. I would say bye. He would never talk anything. He seemed like an honest guy. I never thought he would do something scary like that.”
“Like I told my kids the people you think would never do something like that are the ones that do something and the ones you think would do not so you cannot judge a book by its cover.”
Detectives say if you know about other victims, call them or Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at (305) 471-TIPS.

The governor is looking strong in his re-election bid but his support for Senate Bill 4 may be doing serious damage to the Texas GOP.
Greg Abbott announced his re-election campaign in San Antonio on Friday. Despite my eternal mystification as to why Abbott wants to be governor (he seems to be largely animated by fears of his base and Dan Patrick), there's little doubt that he's popular among the GOP primary voters who decide elections in this state. It's also the case that the governor is sitting on an obscene pile of cash — $34 million at last check. As of yet, he's drawn no Democratic challenger and the long-rumored primary challenge from Dan Patrick remains just that — a rumor.
In other words, Abbott is in good shape at the moment. But, then, that's not much of an accomplishment. How many incumbent Texas Republicans running for re-election to a statewide office have lost in the last two decades? The only name that comes to mind is Victor Carrillo, the former Texas Railroad Commission member who had the misfortune of a Hispanic surname. (He lost in 2010 to David Porter, his GOP primary opponent who barely campaigned.) There may be other examples but generally, if you're a statewide Republican, victory is pretty much guaranteed in Texas.
So, bully for Abbott: He has the numbers and he has the money. But there's evidence that he is doing long-term damage to the Texas Republican brand among a demographic group that the GOP can ill afford to alienate.
Polling conducted by the Texas Tribune and the University of Texas shows Abbott's disapproval rating among Hispanics has soared in the wake of Senate Bill 4, the anti-”sanctuary cities” law that Latino and immigrant groups have condemned as racist. In June 2016, about a third of Latinos polled by the Tribune/UT said they approved of Abbott either strongly or somewhat while 30 percent disapproved. A year later, Abbott's approval among Hispanics is about the same, 27 percent. But his disapproval rating has skyrocketed. Fifty-four percent of Hispanics say they disapprove of the governor and 37 percent strongly disapprove. A 27/54 percent approval rating means he is deeply underwater with a group that he's been courting since Day One.
It's no coincidence that he, and Ted Cruz, are spending so much time in heavily Hispanic areas such as San Antonio and the Rio Grande Valley. Abbott has gone to some lengths to pretend like SB 4 doesn't do what it actually does. After he signed the bill during a weird, hastily announced Facebook Live ceremony, he told Hispanic Texans that what they were hearing about SB 4 was “fear-mongering” and that the new law “does not pose any concern for anybody who's not a criminal.” (A blatant and ridiculous lie defied by the plain text of the law.)
And, of course, he's been mentioning that his wife is Hispanic, as if his marriage to a person of color somehow proves that he can't support racist laws.
“Obviously, with my wife being the first Hispanic first lady of the state of Texas, I care very much about the Hispanic community,” he said.
On the other hand, his approval rating among white people has reached new heights.
