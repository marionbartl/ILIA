1 Nikica Jelavic
Everton boss Roberto Martinez has confirmed two clubs have enquired about signing Nikica Jelavic.
The Croatian striker has not scored this season and has been restricted to substitute appearances since the arrival of on-loan Chelsea star Romelu Lukaku in the summer.
And Martinez admits he may need to make a decision regarding the striker's future when the transfer window opens next week.
He told evertontv: “We've had a couple of enquiries from two different clubs for one of our players.
“We've had a conversation [with Jelavic] and he has the World Cup around the corner. He needs to be playing minutes and we understand that. We'll always try to give a good assessment of the situation, but that's not affecting anyone at the club.
“Whatever happens in January will be for the good of the football club and that's where the work is.”
While it has been assumed that fiscal stimulus works mostly by spurring spending among the poorest households who need the extra cash the most (the “poor-hand-to-mouth”), another group of consumers – the “wealthy-hand-to-mouth” – also consume all of their disposable income every period. The findings are important for policymakers, given the question of which demographic groups to target in order to obtain the biggest bang-for-the-buck from fiscal stimulus programs designed during economic contractions. The research found that while wealthy hand-to-mouth and poor hand-to-mouth households increase their spending by similar amounts in response to small stimulus payments, the wealthy hand-to-mouth continue to ramp up their consumption much less than the poor-hand-to-mouth as the size of the stimulus payments are increased.
In “The Wealthy-Hand-to-Mouth,” authors Greg Kaplan of Princeton University, Giovanni Violante of New York University and Justin Weidner of Princeton University find that both the wealthy hand-to-mouth (those with little or no liquid wealth but substantial holdings of illiquid assets – those that carry a transaction cost to access, such as housing, large durables, or retirement accounts, as opposed to liquid cash, checking, and saving accounts), and the “poor-hand-to-mouth” behave similarly: both groups have “large marginal propensities to consume out of small income changes – a key determinant of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy,” they write. The wealthy-hand-to-mouth choose to weather income fluctuations rather than dipping into their assets to smooth shocks , because smoothing shocks would entail holding large balances of cash and foregoing the high return on their illiquid assets.
The research shows that around one-third of all US households live hand-to-mouth (around 38 million households in 2010, based on 117 million households in 2010, Census Bureau), and of that group, over two-thirds are indeed wealthy-hand-to-mouth. While poor-hand-to-mouth households are most frequently young with low incomes, the wealthy-hand-to-mouth are older (peaking around age 40), have high incomes (similar to the non-hand-to-mouth) and hold substantial illiquid assets (at age 40, around $50,000 on average). In addition, wealthy-hand-to-mouth households hold portfolios that are very similar to the non-hand-to-mouth in terms of their shares of illiquid wealth held in housing and retirement accounts. Unlike the poor hand-to-mouth who tend to stay in this state for long periods of time, wealthy-hand-to-mouth status is transient, lasting an average of only 2.5 years.
The authors then compare households in the US to Canada, Australia, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain to document the share of the wealthy-hand-to-mouth households across countries, their demographic characteristics, the composition of their balance sheets, and how long families remain hand-to-mouth.
Similar to the US, wealthy-hand-to-mouth households are a far greater share of the population than poor-hand-to-mouth households in all the seven other countries studied, and the age profiles of the three groups (wealthy-hand-to-mouth, poor-hand-to-mouth and non-hand-to-mouth) are also remarkably comparable across countries. However, there are large cross-country differences in the overall share of hand-to-mouth households, ranging from over 40 percent in the UK (with over 30 percent of that group being wealthy-hand-to-mouth) to less than 15 percent in Italy (with under 10 percent wealthy-hand-to-mouth).
There are striking parallels among hand-to-mouth households in the US, Canada and the UK, with those three countries having the biggest fraction of both poor- and wealthy-hand-to-mouth. Australia, on the other hand, is somewhat of an outlier among the Anglo-Saxon countries since they have almost no poor-hand-to-mouth households whereas over 20 percent of the population are wealthy-hand-to-mouth. This is due to the very high fraction (85 percent) of the Australian population that has retirement accounts, thanks to a government requirement that makes all employers to contribute to them on behalf of their workers.
Looking at Europe, all countries studied have smaller fractions of both types of hand-to-mouth households than the US, Canada and UK, and hold lower liquid debt. The authors posit that tighter limits on unsecured credit in Europe mean that households there are more incentivized to hold liquid wealth for transactions and precautionary reasons. Unsecured credit is less easily substituted for liquid wealth in Italy, and to a lesser extend in Germany France and Spain than in the Anglo-Saxon countries.

We'll that was fast! Over the holidays we reached our funding goal to begin our campaign to end VFX subsidies. The LA Times ran an article about the effort .
When I first met with our law firm one of the big questions was will there be support for what we are trying to do? Given how quickly many of you responded and supported the first stage I have to say we are all incredibly grateful and impressed. Even with the little indiegogo delay you all continued your support like nothing happened. Thank you.
With 2013 started we are ready to hit the ground running and the question is what's next? When I can I will send updates through the blog. Right now we are initiating the first steps for the feasibility study to determine what will be the right strategy going forward.
On of the first items is documenting the nuts and bolts of how subsidies work in the VFX industry. I'll be working with contacts to get them this information but I'd also like to invite readers who have personal knowledge in this issue. If you feel you might be of help on this email me:
vfxsoldier@gmail.com
We'll assess each message individually. Some information might be redundant but it's great to get some first-hand information on the matter. So if you are someone or know someone who might be willing to reach out on this issue, let me know.
Soldier On.

A few months ago, I forced myself to switch to Windows 8 on my desktop system (and laptop) and ended up liking the operating system very much. Once I got used to the quirks and garish look of the new Start screen and learned many of the shortcuts built into Windows 8, I found myself enjoying the operating system and was more than pleased by its myriad of enhancements and performance improvements.
I initially made the switch to Windows 8 because I wanted to fully immerse myself into the OS before formulating any strong opinions. Considering how much I ended up liking Windows 8 on my desktop, I thought I would conduct a similar experiment with my smartphone. For the last few years, I have been deeply entrenched in the Android ecosystem and have experience with a multitude of devices. I enjoy installing custom ROMs on the devices and have experimented with countless apps and utilities. At this point my smartphone is an integral part of my day-to-day computing, and I've grown fond of a handful of apps and the convenience of always having my inboxes and access to the web in my pocket.
The Lumia 920 is Nokia's current flagship Windows Phone.
I picked up a [Windows Phone 8-based Nokia Lumia 920 and was initially impressed. The hardware itself is excellent. The Lumia 920's camera is top notch. The device is obviously well-built. The screen looks great, and navigating through Windows Phone 8 was smooth as silk. At first, my Android-based device (currently a Samsung Galaxy Note II) remained my daily driver. I kept the Lumia 920 handy until I felt I was comfortable using its email client, browsing the web. But eventually I customized the Start screen to my liking and got a good feel for what Microsoft and Nokia were trying to accomplish with the phone. I installed only a couple of apps and got comfortable with them too.
After a couple of weeks and a good initial impression, I decided to dive in head-first and make the Lumia 920 my daily device. At first, I was happy with the decision. I dug the Live Tiles and the Lumia 920 never lost its luster; it's a great phone.
But as I started to install more and more apps and dig deeper into the Windows Phone App Store, I was regularly disappointed. There seemed to be three kinds of apps available for Windows Phone 8:
Apps specifically designed for the OS that showed signs of greatness
Quick-and-dirty ports of apps obviously designed for other platforms
Kludges that were nothing more than wrappers for mobile websites
The apps designed with Windows Phone 8 in mind were mostly great. I especially liked the IMDB app, which blows away its counterparts on other mobile platforms. The Facebook app was also very fast and responsive, but it wastes a TON of screen real estate with larger-than-necessary fonts in the navigation menu and wasted white space in the feed. There were times when I could only see a single post in my news feed because of all the wasted screen real estate. I'm not sure what the app developers were thinking with that one.
Then there were the obvious ports that just didn't look right on Windows Phone 8. One in particular, Words with Friends, comes to mind. I know it's an older title and games aren't a necessity, but I enjoy playing Words with Friends; it's a nice break in the day. Anyway, fonts (like the one used to display the score) were nearly illegible and the game is just plain broken. As of a couple of weeks ago, you couldn't use words with the letter “Z” and the main screen wouldn't update when it was your turn. You'd think with the amount of complaints logged in the app store someone at Microsoft would fix the game, but no such luck.
And then there are apps like YouTube, which seem to be little more than wrappers for the YouTube mobile site. Minimal effort was put into optimizing the app for Windows Phone 8, and it shows.
As you probably guessed by now, my little experience was a failure. I'm back to my Android device and don't plan to give Windows Phone 8 another try for a few months. If Microsoft wants people to give Windows Phone 8 serious consideration, they've got to get serious about offering quality apps for the platform. It's not just about the number of available apps, it's about the quality, and at this point in time Windows Phone 8 trails in both departments.
Short one, what I've been up to lately:
Made AI actually perform events and gave it a proper action cost system, includes things like spawning items into the ship locker and upgrading ships. Involved pretty significant re-work of ship upgrades tracking.
With metadept, made more changes to the way biomes and spawn profiles are paired, and more info can go into the spawn profile on the biome, going to be used for things like tying specific color palettes to monsters within a biome.
Fixed interface bugs with the cockpit and E key and input priority handling
Fixed bug with current versioning upgrade scripts (still broken for stable -> nightly, lots more work to do)
Fixed fuel, after I (purposefully) broke it making the ship upgrades work with the AI.
STARTED work on a new system for essential items like the beamaxe. Rather than having the beamaxe be an item that can't be thrown away, there will be several essential slots below the L and R slots that hold the beamaxe, paint tool, and wire tool. They will act like slots in the action bar, but are less like items and more like permanent player upgrades. Also, we've gotten rid of the system that applied status effects for items sitting in the inventory.
Also lots more boring stuff with the spawner and fixing other internal issues and bugs (or so my git log tells me).
GLENDIVE, Montana — When an oil pipeline burst in July 2011 and poured 63,000 gallons of crude into the Yellowstone River 200 miles upstream from Dena Hoff's farm of wheat, beans and corn on the Great Plains in Glendive, she felt disgusted. When it happened again Saturday, she felt terror. This pipeline breach was underneath the Yellowstone River, just a few feet from her sheep pasture. The new spill poured out some 50,000 gallons of crude oil. Leaders of this small riverside farming and ranching community in northeastern Montana warned residents not to drink their tap water, because benzene, a carcinogen, was found in the municipal water system. Oil slicked the river for dozens of miles, almost to the border with North Dakota. Hoff's property smelled sickeningly like diesel. “People need to understand this is a very serious thing,” she said. “It impacts everything and everybody downstream.” Certainly the disaster is far more than just a local issue. As more than 100 emergency workers hacked at thick river ice in a frantic attempt to find and contain the spilled oil, the U.S. Senate in Washington made good on what its new Republican leaders promised would be their first order of business: approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which would also cross the Yellowstone River in Glendive. “The State Department has affirmed the safety of Keystone XL pipeline,” said freshman Sen. Steve Daines, R-Montana, who was joined in his support by senior Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana. “It's important that this job-creating project is approved.”

But that might not be so straightforward. In its similarities to the January 2014 chemical spill in West Virginia's Elk River and the 2012 tar sands pipeline spill in Michigan's Kalamazoo River, Montana's latest Yellowstone River spill wrenched focus back to Keystone's risks. While President Barack Obama has vowed to veto Keystone, the enthusiasm of its boosters has left many who live in its path worried that it will still be built, possibly at the expense of vital infrastructure upkeep and without sound contingency plans for spills. The scene in Glendive offered them no comfort. “This is bad,” said Irene Moffett, 79, who ranches and farms on a vast bench of grass above the Yellowstone River in Glendive. “But it's nothing compared to what they want to put in.” The 12-inch-diameter Poplar Pipeline spilled on Saturday morning. By Monday night, Glendive residents cleaned local grocery store shelves of bottled water as news spread that health officials had found benzene levels in the municipal water treatment plant at two to three times what the Center for Disease Control says is safe for long-term exposure. Some elderly residents reported not having anything to drink to take medication. People who had drunk from their taps complained of stomachaches. Hospital and schools struggled to keep their charges hydrated and safe. Some businesses were forced to cut back services or close. People fled town to do laundry or take showers. Not until Tuesday morning did the first pallets of clean, bottled water from Bridger Pipeline, owner of the Poplar Pipeline, arrive in Glendive. They were dispensed first to hospital, schools, nursing homes and the prison. Then they to went to other residents. Bill Salvin, a spokesman hired by Bridger Pipeline who also fielded calls on Tuesday for the county government's emergency services command center, said the delay was due to “a matter of logistics.”

The ruptured pipeline was built in the 1950s, he said, and was last tested in 2012. The results of that test are unknown. A news station in Billings, KTVQ, reported that another one of the four pipelines owned by Bridger Pipeline recently leaked thousands of gallons of oil in North Dakota, costing the company tens of thousands in fines. Salvin had no estimate for the cost of cleaning the new spill, but he said most of the oil is trapped under ice. “We will have all the resources we need,” he said. Glendive Mayor Jerry Jimison said the spill underscores the outsize burden shouldered by local communities in the midst of oil booms. Glendive lies on the edge of the Bakken Shale formation, a vast oil reserve that spans eastern Montana, western North Dakota and southern Saskatchewan. A decade-old surge in drilling, much of it done by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has attracted tens of thousands of workers. This lowered unemployment regionally, and some economists say fracking has made the cost of gas plunge nationally. But the huge boost in production wore down local infrastructures, and some eastern Montana residents say they now bear that cost in the form of Bakken chemicals in their water. “Eastern Montana provides a tremendous amount of the state's income, and we here deserve the same benefits of clean drinking water,” said Jimison, 68. “The No. 1 issue for the city is to get that rectified.” It could be at least a week until it's safe for the town's 6,000 municipal water users to use their taps again, he said. A similar problem is now chronic in the nearby town of Poplar, on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. In 2010 the EPA ruled that Poplar's municipal water had turned too toxic to drink because of pollution from oil drilling. However, pipeline proponents stress that modern infrastructure is more secure than ever and that pipelines remain the safest way to move mass amounts of oil. Richard Dunbar, president of the Montana Association of Oil, Gas and Coal Counties, said the Glendive spill should actually serve as a selling point for Keystone. “Well, this is what we have on the new pipeline as opposed to what we have on the older one,” said Dunbar, a commissioner in Philips County, Montana, where Keystone would enter the U.S. “Show all the updated safety features.”
‘Eastern Montana provides a tremendous amount of the state's income, and we here deserve the same benefits of clean drinking water. The No. 1 issue for the city is to get that rectified.' Jerry Jimison mayor of Glendive
But Alexis Bonogofsky, an environmental activist and farmer, said she has learned not to believe safety claims about pipelines. She was hospitalized for hydrocarbon exposure after the 2011 rupture of ExxonMobil's Silvertip pipeline, and she then watched her land along the Yellowstone River south of Billings lose hay, fill with weeds and feed fewer goats. “This land is not the same as it was before, and we aren't sure it ever will be,” said Bonogofsky, 34. “I wish I could be surprised that there is another spill in the Yellowstone, but I'm not. It's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when.” Jeff Farrells, 62, the executive director of the Pipeline Association for Public Awareness, said that while new pipelines are safer than old ones, they are far from infallible. “Nothing's perfect. I wish it was,” he said. “Is it worth the risk? The answer to that question in the past in this country has always been yes.” He added that the spill happened less than a month before a training session his association scheduled in Glendive on how to deal with a major spill. The scenic undammed Yellowstone River is “the last major wild river in the Lower 48,” said Scott Bosse, the Northern Rockies director of the conservation group American Rivers. From its headwaters high in a mountainous Wyoming wilderness south of Yellowstone National Park to its confluence with the Missouri River on the prairie of North Dakota, the nearly 700-mile river is home to an abundance of wildlife, including trout, eagles, grizzly bears, buffaloes, elk, otters, antelopes and moose. Near Glendive, the river hosts the rare pallid sturgeon and also paddlefish, a prehistoric giant whose ecological fate is bound to Glendive's prosperity. In recent decades, as supply dropped in Asia, caviar from Glendive's paddlefish has surged in value. The black roe of a single one can sell for $1,000. The Glendive Chamber of Commerce markets this caviar to fine restaurants in Tokyo, Paris and New York. It has invested more than half a million dollars in proceeds on parks, youth sports and museums. The spill has put the fish in jeopardy, said Bob Gibson, a spokesman for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. “Any kind of petroleum chemical, one of the places that accumulates is in the roe,” he said. “We have biologists out on the ice trying to figure out what's happening.”
David Beckham. Michael Steele / Getty I'm a white male.
As the New York Times has reported and loads of scientific research has found, membership within that demographic means that I am constantly benefiting from a range of sexist, racist, and unconscious biases.
While we'd have a more just society if that weren't true, a host of economic and psychological studies have found that white males are perceived as more likeable, hireable, and trustworthy than other groups.
Let's get into the deeply uncomfortable research, because if we can become aware of these biases, we have a better shot at doing something about them.
In a blind test, professors with male names were rated higher than those with female names, regardless of their actual gender.
In a 2014 North Carolina State study, researchers split 43 students in an online course into four discussion groups.
A female instructor led two of the groups, and a male led the other two. The female instructor told one of her groups that she was a man, and the male instructor told one of his groups that he was a woman. Crucially, students couldn't see or hear the instructors, so they couldn't tell who was which sex.
At the end of the course, students were asked to rate their instructors on 12 traits, including fairness, enthusiasm, and promptness.
"We found that the instructor whom students thought was male received higher ratings on all 12 traits, regardless of whether the instructor was actually male or female," lead author Lillian MacNell said in a release. "There was no difference between the ratings of the actual male and female instructors."
Job candidates with "white sounding" names were rated higher than those with "black sounding" names.
In a 2003 paper, economists Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan replied to help-wanted ads in Chicago and Boston with fake résumés.
Some applicants used names like Emily and Greg, while others used names like Lakisha and Jamal.
"The results show significant discrimination against African-American names," the authors wrote. "White names receive 50% more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better résumé. For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30% more callbacks, whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase."
Looking at an identical case study, people preferred the male name over the female.
In 2003, Frank Flynn taught a Harvard Business School case study on Silicon Valley entrepreneur Heidi Roizin to a class at Columbia. Her story is epic: After graduating from Stanford's Graduate School of Business in 1983, she founded an early Silicon Valley software company before becoming president of Software Publishers' Association and later serving as Vice President of World Wide Developer Relations for Apple. Then she became a venture capitalist and Stanford lecturer.
But when those Columbia students read her story, only half of them knew her as Heidi Roizin. The other half read the same story with a changed name: Heidi became Howard.
The students reacted very differently to the same protagonist, depending on the perceived gender.
"Although [students] think [Heidi is] just as competent and effective as Howard, they don't like her, they wouldn't hire her, and they wouldn't want to work with her," Flynn later said. "As gender researchers would predict, this seems to be driven by how much they disliked Heidi's aggressive personality. The more assertive they thought Heidi was, the more harshly they judged her (but the same was not true for those who rated Howard)."
In short, men are liked for being assertive, while women are disliked.
White people were more likely to get a free bus ride than black people.
In a recent Australian study, researchers asked 29 confederates of a range of genders and ethnicities to board buses, attempt to pay for the ride with a fare card that was out of money, and then ask for a ride to a station over a mile away when it didn't go through.
In a Times op-ed, Yale law professor Ian Ayres said that the study "uncovered substantial, statistically significant race discrimination."
He continued:
Bus drivers were twice as willing to let white testers ride free as black testers (72% versus 36% of the time). Bus drivers showed some relative favoritism toward testers who shared their own race, but even black drivers still favored white testers over black testers (allowing free rides 83% versus 68% of the time).
That's the nature of white male privilege: Even if they and the people they interact with aren't aware of it, they're constantly getting the benefit of the doubt.

An RCMP database on missing persons and unidentified remains, touted by the Harper government in 2010 as "concrete action" for the problem of murdered and missing indigenous women, is still incomplete and far over budget five years after it was announced.
The national database, plagued by technical problems, won't be fully in place until late 2016 – more than three years after it was supposed to be helping police across Canada solve crimes.
The initial $1.6-million budget for the project has swollen to at least $2.4 million, drawing scarce resources away from other important RCMP initiatives.
CBC News uncovered details of the botched IT project through a document obtained under the Access to Information Act.
"Due to the delays, it will take another year and will cost approximately double the original estimate," says a June 28, 2015, internal evaluation of the project.
'Adverse effect'
"In addition to the financial implications, this delay has had an adverse effect on the RCMP's work with Canadian policing partners who had expected the database to be operational by early 2013."
Conservative Leader Stephen Harper says that there are a range of measures to deal with cases of murdered and missing indigenous women when asked about the delay in the promised database. 0:55
The database was a key element of a $10-million initiative announced by the minister for the status of women, Rona Ambrose, in Vancouver on Oct. 29, 2010, as the Harper government faced pressure to call an inquiry into more than 1,000 murdered and missing indigenous women and girls.
"The disturbing issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women is one of serious concern and, as Canadians, we know aboriginal women deserve respect, dignity and the right to feel safe," Ambrose told a news conference.
That's not only disheartening, it's absolutely appalling. - Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president Native Women's Association of Canada
​The RCMP created a slimmer version of the database in 2014 without much of the system's intended functionality, with software updates planned this fall and next year, Staff-Sgt. Julie Gagnon told CBC News.
She added that the incomplete tool has not yet solved any cases.
"The automated linkage analysis function … has not yet resulted in any confirmed matches of missing persons to unidentified remains," she said in an email.
Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada, says the delayed database shows the federal government lacks the political will to address the problem of murdered and missing indigenous women and girls.
An internal lessons-learned document says the database project was beset with problems, including delays in getting a basic security clearance for the contractor. The RCMP itself provides security clearances for the government.
The evaluation of other aspects of Ambrose's $10-million announcement was more positive, with successful improvements to the Canadian Police Information Centre system, known as CPIC, and creation of a website where the public can provide tips to help solve crimes.
Lack of political will?
"Specifics on the value of tips submitted as a result of visiting the website are not available," the document says.
The president of the Native Women's Association of Canada says the delayed database project is yet more evidence that the government of Canada does not take the issue seriously.
"The fact that it's taking Canada so long to address this shows that it really is a lack of political will," Dawn Lavell-Harvard told CBC News from Toronto. "That's not only disheartening, it's absolutely appalling that they could treat human beings in such a way.… Every week there's another aboriginal woman who goes missing."
Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney says three of four initiatives reviewed in the RCMP evaluation were 'fully implemented with positive results.' (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press)
The Harper government has continued to resist calls for a national inquiry into the problem of murdered and missing indigenous women and girls, promising action rather than study. Both the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party promise to call an inquiry should they form government.
Ambrose's office declined comment on the delayed database, referring questions to Public Safety Minister Steven Blaney who's responsible for the RCMP.
In an email, Blaney noted that three of four initiatives reviewed by the RCMP evaluation were "fully implemented with positive results."
In Saskatoon, the NDP leader says he'd launch an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women within the first 100 days of an NDP government. 1:45
Blaney also said another $8.1-million project announced last year, creation of a DNA-based missing persons index as part of the RCMP's national DNA data bank, will become a powerful tool to resolve cases of missing persons and unidentified remains, and bring closure to families.

Earlier this month, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation boosting the compensation of Californians taking paid family leave, allowing residents to take six weeks off and still earn up to 70 percent of lost wages after the birth of a child or when taking care of a sick family member.
The legislation may help close a large geographical disparity in who actually takes paid family leave.
Last year, residents in the Bay Area and along the Central Coast took advantage of paid family leave significantly more often than residents elsewhere in California, according to data obtained by The Sacramento Bee from the Employment Development Department.
In Los Angeles County last year, there were about 40 paid family-leave claims filed per 100 births. In Santa Cruz County, there were 75 claims filed per 100 births. In San Francisco, it was 62 claims per 100 births. In Sacramento, the rate was 52 claims per 100 births. (Close to 90 percent of paid family-leave claims are to bond with newborn children.)

The Bee's analysis found that areas with high average wages also tended to have a high proportion of residents taking family leave.
Several Bay Area companies recently have instituted generous paid family-leave policies, and high-profile Silicon Valley executives including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg have taken family leave after the birth of a child.

Atlanta Falcons linebacker Sean Weatherspoon has an open dislocation of one of his fingers on his left hand and is out indefinitely, coach Mike Smith told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday.

Weatherspoon, who calls the defensive signals for the Falcons, suffered the injury in the team's joint practice with the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday.
"It was an open dislocation. We are going to keep him out, and the time frame is going to be based on how quick the wound heals. It's a matter of the wound healing," Smith told the newspaper.
Weatherspoon, 25, finished second on the Falcons with 95 tackles last season. He also had three sacks and an interception.
Smith also told the newspaper that Julio Jones also will not play in Thursday night's preseason opener against the Bengals because of tightness in his hamstrings.
"It is a precautionary move," Smith told the newspaper.

As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January, one challenge looms large: China and its expanding role in the vital Asia-Pacific region. The incoming Administration will need to develop a long-term Pacific strategy—which ultimately eluded President Obama's team.
Creating a long-term policy toward China will be difficult: Trump's recent questioning of the venerable “one China” policy and China's vigorous reaction illustrates the hypersensitivity in Beijing. There is certainly leeway to change and clarify policy, but rocking the boat without a strategic plan—as Trump did by taking a call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen—has already resulted in ominous pronouncements by China.
What are the key elements of such a strategy? A durable China policy would have to reconcile two key elements: security and trade. Security is foundational to protecting our interests, reassuring our allies and maintaining the open commons and international norms upon which global commerce depends. Trade is the engine of global prosperity and stability. Both are challenged by China's desire to dominate the region and effectively construct a “Great Wall of Sand” around its territorial claims in the region—especially in the flashpoint of the South China Sea, through which 30% of the world's maritime trade passes annually.
We must start by recognizing that building security is a team sport. It is crucial for the U.S. to maintain and strengthen our alliances and security partnerships throughout the region—Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines are treaty allies. India, Malaysia, Vietnam and others are friends. Our Pacific allies are watching China's rise and increased assertiveness with uncertainty, just as we are. Our engagement—whether by military exercises, arms sales or mere presence—is critical to reassuring them.
A second crucial element of our strategy should be in the cyber world. We have seen many instances of alleged aggressive Chinese cyber behavior, including stealing commercial and military technology, breaking into vital U.S. databases and manipulating financial information. We need to work with China to establish mutually acceptable behavior in the cyber realm as part of our strategy.
Third, we need a robust trade component. Trade and diplomacy—not force—are the best ways to encourage other countries to comply with international norms. Well over half of all U.S. exports, including close to three-quarters of our agricultural exports, go to the region—most by freely transiting the ocean. Trump may be determined to keep the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but economic engagement with Pacific economies—including China—is crucial. We should consider whether to renegotiate the TPP or begin the laborious process of finding a substitute. Robust trade with China may be the key to encouraging cooperation on the Law of the Sea, open and peaceful activity in the cyber and space domains, and restraint of rogue actors from North Korea to Malaccan pirates.
Fourth, we should support international treaties and organizations. The U.S. must continue to calmly but firmly reinforce international rules of innocent passage, freedom of navigation and the lawful extent of national waters in the South China Sea and other Pacific-area choke points. The U.S. should also finally ratify the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea: we already abide by it, and we rely on it to encourage China (already a signatory) to do the same.
Setting U.S. policy in the Pacific on a sustainable course will require immediate action. Trump and his team will have to start with the basics—reassuring allies, maintaining open global commons, improving trade relationships and calming the cyber sphere—and build from there.
Most important, the U.S.-China relationship must be prevented from becoming a “Thucydides trap” in which a rising power and an established one view each other with such suspicion that conflict appears inevitable. Inflammatory or chaotic language and actions will not help. U.S. presence across the Pacific is not new or threatening, and the new Administration should not retreat or deviate from long-standing and clearly stated goals of maintaining open sea lanes and upholding global standards of conduct. A thoughtfully constructed and methodically executed strategy in the face of a rising China must be a first order of business for the new Administration.

I've been telling myself to stay out of this debate. I've been assuring myself that any time spent reading rants, posts, and their circular comments will only make me feel resentful and defensive. I tell myself that the fight is over and no one won. I rationalize that only a few people are ruining it for the rest of us and therefore, those few should just be ignored. I vow to stop drawing attention to this ridiculous creature, to stop reinforcing the idea that the “Fake Geek Girl” exists.
“Why don't you just drop it?” “Why can't you take a joke?” “Why aren't you over this?” I ask myself these things too.
The truth is, I don't know. But, recently, I've been asked by Badass Digest to weigh in on why such accusations have a strong impact on our community, and to provide some of the psychological explanations for why we've reacted the way we have to the recent verbal attacks on female fans and to the accusations that some are “fake nerds.” Can we learn anything from this, beyond acknowledging that these claims are rude and unequivocally sexist? We know that it's absurd. We do! So why does it keep getting dragged into our dialogue? And if we are accused of fakedom, why do we snap back in defense? We've been called some awful, demeaning things in our past. But this “F”-word seems to have climbed the ranks to become one of the most insulting labels. Why so much power? Why are we so deeply threatened by the notion of falsified fandom?
We're told we're overreacting.
I wish it were that simple. Trust me–I'd prefer to raise an eyebrow, flip my hair, and be on my way. But the much stronger reaction to the accusation of being “fake” can't be explained by just one isolated feeling. This stronger reaction stems from years of repeated, accumulated experiences of insults, indignities, and demeaning messages from other members of the comics community. These experiences–the seemingly harmless comments, the sarcastic jokes, the subtle non-physical exchanges–are called microaggressions. The theory of microaggressions was developed back in the 70′s to denote racial stereotyping, but was expanded by psychologist Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. in 2007 to encompass a wide variety and classifications of these subtle and seemingly harmless expressions that communicate “hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults” toward people who aren't members of the ingroup. These outgroup members might include women, racial/ethnic minorities, LBGT members, and others historically marginalized in our community.
Here are some examples of gender microaggressions in the context of female members of the comics community:
“You sure know a lot about Batman, for a girl.” “You don't look like a geek.” “That's nice of you to come to Star Wars celebration for your boyfriend.” “Did your older brother get you into comics? “You're a nerd's wet dream.”
I didn't say that men are the only assailants when it comes to gender microaggressions. Women also deliver these seemingly harmless bites.
Why are microaggressions harmful? They seem silly, right? But these comments actually communicate messages that exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person. Sure, these incidents typically appear minute, banal and trivial. Sometimes they produce a good laugh. But repeated experiences of receiving them can have a long-term psychological impact. For instance, here are the implied messages about women in the comics community:
“You do not belong.” “You are abnormal.” “You are intellectually inferior.” “You cannot be trusted.” “You are all the same.”
These messages can therefore be pervasive and potentially damaging to a large group of people. And the reason they are micro-aggressions, Dr. Sue explains, is that the person delivering them may be well-intentioned and non-threatening in nature, maybe not even aware of their own biases. They, too, are had their own experiences that have shaped their perspectives. In most cases, when confronted, the person will deny that they meant any harm, explain that they were joking, and tell the recipient that she is being too sensitive. I cannot emphasize enough the point here:
1. The recipients of microaggressions feel victimized and threatened. 2. Their assailants feel like they did no harm. 3. BOTH ARE CORRECT IN THEIR EXPERIENCES.
Thus the endless cycle of invalidation, misunderstanding, defensiveness and back to invalidation. We're seeing the cycle play out now in the context of social media where there seems to be a huge misunderstanding about the definition of “satire.”
Let me be clear about what IS NOT a microaggression:
“You're not comics.” “You don't know SHIT about comics.” “You are what I refer to as CON-HOT.”
These are examples of actual threats, verbal assaults, and intentionally insulting remarks. There is no doubt they are sexist and I'm not tackling them here. But these comments do trigger an emotional response because they confirm past microaggressive experiences. That is, they reinforce the stereotypes, the deluded beliefs that women lack comics knowledge, that women who affiliate with geekdom shouldn't look feminine/pretty/sexy, and that male members of the community are responsible for our membership. These instances are like knife-stabs in vulnerable places.
We're told we're invisible.
Sometimes I feel like I'm standing right in front of someone and they still don't see me. I've explained to people that the reason I sometimes express my geekdom superficially, through a ridiculous amount of fan-wear, is for the identity recognition. I admit, I have a deep and sometimes desperate desire to be seen for who I am, for my geek identify to be validated. There's a part of me that is yelling, “Please see me!” And yet, despite my flamboyance, I'm still overlooked. In my experience, this typically happens in the form of a microaggression– a subtype called microinvalidation.
I recently traveled to a psychology conference, and, upon arriving at the airport for my departing flight, experienced an example of a microinvalidation. At security check, after my technology went through the scanner, I scurried over to gather my shoes and belongings. I picked up my Star Wars hoodie and wrapped it around my Batgirl t-shirt. The thirty-something male TSA agent pointed to my Kindle, the one with the Star Wars comics cover, and immediately looked at the stranger standing next to me: “Is this your Kindle?” The stranger next to me, a twenty-something looking guy dressed in plain jeans and a pale shirt, shook his head. “It's mine,” I blurted. The TSA-man then leaned forward and said, giddily, “That's really awesome. I love Star Wars too.” A compliment. But I couldn't process the kind words because I was still recovering from being stunned by his assumption that my things do not actually belong to me. A reminder of the widespread belief that Star Wars is gendered. It's male. The thing I love is for males.
The mistaken identity stayed with me. The negative thoughts of being invisible flooded my mind. Resentment became my in-flight entertainment. But because I insisted on obsessing over a microinvalidation, I dismissed a validating compliment and an opportunity to feel visible. And damnit, an opportunity to geek out with someone who liked my stuff. Ridiculous, huh? I'm guilty of perpetuating the cycle, too.

Microinvalidations are just one explanation of why we're incited when being accused of being an imposter. But it's an important one because it refers to a basic human need. Psychologically we have a deep desire to be recognized and to belong. Our social identity– who we are, essentially, to the world– is greatly determined by the groups we belong to. We develop much of ourselves from our groups: self-esteem, purpose, a sense of belonging, approval. Thus, being accused of being an imposter is actually very damaging and fragmenting to our sense of self because it's like someone is telling us, “you're not who you say you are.” Again, these comments seem so harmless and silly, but they undoubtedly exclude, negate, or nullify the psychological thoughts, feelings, or experiential reality of a person. If we're recipients of these messages, we experience powerlessness, loss of integrity, and invisibility.
We're told we can't keep up intellectually.
How are costumes in any way related to comics knowledge? Moreover, how are skimpy costumes related to comics knowledge? And what if these women who cosplay want to be seen in their costume and therefore want the attention? (GASP!). I have no explanation for this imagined fantasy that women who cosplay for attention cannot be actual nerds. But I have to acknowledge that the accusation of being “fake” stings like hydrosulphuric acid because of the underlying message that we're not knowledgeable enough to read, enjoy and understand comics, especially if we're wearing a costume that's seen as provocative or revealing. “You're too busy looking like a slut you can't possibly have read all the issues of The Walking Dead.” I don't get it. I simply can't form a sensible relationship between skin and stupidity, because these two things operate on completely different, orthogonal planes. But nothing seems more damaging to a woman than the simultaneous attack on both her body and her brain.
Why are we threatened by the Imposter?
I've talked about how the “fake” accusation can be more than just insulting, how it actually taps into some deeper feelings stemming from accumulated negative experiences. But what IF some of these women in question were, in fact, “fake?” What if there are people out there conning us, putting on a guise, attempting to pass as one of us? Why does the imposter, who represents a small fraction of our community, seem to have grabbed so much focus and power? Perhaps we're enraged by the “fake geek girl” accusation in the first place because we find imposters to be very threatening. Here are some reasons why we might be threatened by inauthentic members of our society:
1. The false notion of limited resources: Growing up, many of us experienced our fandoms in the context of collections, acquisitions, and serialized products. Our fandoms seem to manifest as measurable amounts of goods. Our vocabulary includes words like “exclusive,” “mint condition,” and “collectible.” We know that Comic-Con tickets will sell out. We know that Mondo will only offer 580 Olly Moss Lord of the Rings posters and 285 variant posters. Guess what? They sold out in 3 minutes. Like it or not, we think of our fandom as serialized and limited. We're a possessive lot and it's not entirely our fault. The notion of an imposter–someone who doesn't truly care about the personal meaning and value of the items– is threatening to us because they may take from our precious, vulnerable pot.
The opposite is actually true if we think about intangible goods– the vast amount of knowledge across all geek genres from comic books to fantasy literature to video games. There's such a large universe that the few imposters–if they really existed–are not realistic threats.
2. The misinterpreted sense of ownership. When we belong to a community, we develop a sense of deserved ownership. When I was young, I received fan club cards and membership letters to inform me that I belonged to a particular club, reinforcing the exclusivity of the group. Serial numbers, laminated cards, and now, e-mails and twitter groups seem to reify the notion that belonging to a group means we are shareholders and that others are not. Shareholding grants us certain conceptual privileges: We get to decide who else is in or out. But, really, apart from the tangible products, what do we really own?
3. Resentment of the changing culture. Some of us grew up hiding our geek identity for one reason or another. Maybe we felt insecure; maybe we got bullied for being “out.” Some of us hid or masked our identities as geeks well until adulthood. For many of us, when we see individuals who appear to have recently joined the community we feel uncomfortable with their different identity development. We had to suffer the bullying! But now that it's “cool” to be geeked, here they come in droves! God, they even look happy. Let's stop that. That's a whole lot of projection on people we don't know. And they don't deserve it.
The feelings of being threatened, invalidated, and overlooked can happen to any one of us in this community–some psychologists argue that when the threats are ambiguous or subtle (like microaggressions), they can be more damaging because there is no certainty and the assault is denied or ignored. They say that we don't do any good for ourselves if we latch on to the few experiences that give us the greatest pain–we have to escape the cycle. We should point out the real threats, defending ourselves, correcting lies, demonstrating that it's not incongruous to be sexy and smart; we're a disservice to ourselves if we miss opportunities to highlight and celebrate the healthy validation and recognition happening by both men and women in this community.
In other words, we've got to stop being exclusive. All of us have, at one point or another, experienced bullying, invisibility, insult, attack, or violation. This is the human condition. But I seriously wonder if we've pulled these abilities from the dark, awful places of our childhood, lashing out quite expertly to newcomers or strangers, in ways we know are the most painful.

The Central Ohio Transit Authority�s new Downtown circulator, dubbed Cbus, is to carry its first passengers today.
There is no fee to ride the bus, which runs along High and Front streets between the Short North and the Brewery District.
The bus runs faster than most COTA lines, with 10-minute frequencies at each stop during the day and 15-minute frequencies at night. If passengers time it right, they shouldn�t have to wait more than five minutes for a circulator bus, said CEO Curtis Stitt.
There will be no charge through December, and COTA then will re-evaluate whether it will charge for rides, he said.
The 5.4-mile route has 29 stops.
In August, COTA ordered six 30-foot buses for the circulator; five will run during peak times. The buses are shorter than other COTA buses, which are 35 feet to 40 feet.
COTA officials say they hope this circulator is more successful than a predecessor that was cut in 2004. Buses that were fashioned to resemble trolley cars carried passengers between the Short North and the former City Center mall during midday for 25 cents.
Operating the new service is estimated to cost $1.3 million a year. Stitt said at least 10 percent of the cost needs to be subsidized to keep the free fares.

SENATOR DAVID NORRIS caused a stir earlier today when he hit out at the Fine Gael TD Regina Doherty over her comments in relation to the abolition of the Seanad, describing her as “speaking out of her f***y”.
Norris was among a number of senators who heavily criticised the government's plans to abolish the Seanad during the Order of Business this afternoon after Fine Gael launched their referendum campaign today on the plinth at Leinster House.
Director of Elections Richard Bruton described the upper house as a luxury that can no longer be afforded while Doherty said it is “shockingly undemocratic” and does not play a meaningful role in Irish democracy.
An angry Norris told the chamber this afternoon: “The idea that someone who has been a member of this house… has to listen to ‘The Regina Monologues' from somebody who's not a wet week in this house, talking through her f***y, I object on the strongest possible basis.”
Norris described an earlier press release from Fine Gael announcing details of their Seanad aboliton campaign as a “malignant and mendacious piece of tripe” and said that senators should issue a joint statement rejecting what he said was a “tissue of lies”.
Earlier, Fianna Fáil senator Mary White accused Bruton and Doherty of being “ignorant about how we get elected to Seanad Éireann”.
“How dare [they] criticise us as ineffective. How dare they do this to us,” she told senators describing the Fine Gael press release as “like propaganda from Hitler or something”.
Her colleague, Terry Leyden – who himself referenced Hitler in the Seanad last week – said that Bruton, the jobs minister, should “be bloody well busy enough with jobs”.

Richard Bruton: The Seanad is a luxury we can no longer afford
Walk into a bar in Berlin - for example, a trendy one called Room 77 - and try paying with a credit card. It's not gonna happen.
The owner doesn't allow it. “For a biz person of this size with 5 to 10% profit margins,” says owner Joerg Platzer, “giving 3% of that to Mastercard? It makes it a no-go.”
Platzer says his patrons either pay cash or they light up their virtual wallets on their smartphones, and pay in bitcoins - or fractions of bitcoins, depending on the exchange rate. Crypto-currencies get Platzer really excited. And he dreams big. Platzer is looking forward to bitcoins ushering in an entirely new economic system.
A bitcoin is a kind of computer currency. It's becoming increasingly more accepted in markets around the world, and its value is based upon how many people invest in having bitcoins. The more people who want bitcoins, the higher the demand and the a more single bitcoin is worth. Unlike any other form of currency, the value of a bitcoin has never been tied to a physical object, like a piece of gold.
Bar owner Platzer isn't the only one who's getting excited about bitcoins, especially in this part of Berlin.
Numerous restaurants and stores in the trendy Kreutzberg and Neue Koeln neighborhoods now accept them, including Long Player records, which sells old fashioned vinyl LP's. Owner Narim Chebli says the possibility of paying in bitcoins brings him a steady stream of customers.
“In Kreuzberg and Neue Koeln there are a lot of young people,” he said, “and they're open-minded for new things, for new payments.”
But what's in it for him, accepting bitcoins? Marketing. He likes the contrast, he said, between the old and new.
"I think it's interesting because I only have vinyl,” Chebli said, “and I take money that is digital. That's the main reason.”
Ok, so for Chebli, it's a gimmick. But make no mistake, Berlin is a veritable hub for Bitcoin believers. Actually they're more than believers. Some are making serious money.
Joerg Von Minckwitz is the young CEO of Bitcoin Berlin, a start-up consulting firm teaching clients how bitcoins work, and how to use them.
“The basic idea is that everybody can be their own bank,” he said. “We don't need banks anymore to transfer money. So in our mind, banks are kind of useless.”
When it comes to transferring money, Von Minkwitz says with Bitcoin, it is faster - and free. But he admits this is hardly a risk-free currency. In its four years, Bitcoin has bounced in value from pennies against the dollar to hundreds of dollars per unit.
“At the moment, it's still fluctuating,” he said. “We're in the early stage and the system has to grow to get more stable.”
Don't invest your retirement money in bitcoins, Von Minkwitz said. Not yet, anyway.
Still Room 77's Joerg Platzer said he's confident that Bitcoin will stabilize in the long run. For him, it promises a real free market – that is, free of government control.
Since you'd be anonymous, you could even avoid the taxman or force the government to spend your money on things you want.
“The government could go like, okay, we have two plans,” he said. “One plan is we need bridges, hospitals and schools. Or we want to build a secret surveillance infrastructure to read your emails. You decide what to spend your taxes on.”
Or your bitcoins, that is.
In Barcelona, the strike is due to last 24 hours. In other cities, such as Valencia, drivers walked off the job for two hours this morning.
A march is planned in central Madrid for midday, with taxi drivers descending on the capital from all over Spain.
This is the second strike by taxi drivers in Spain this year.

In late 2014, a Spanish court ordered Uber to stop operations in the country after a complaint from a taxi association that came in the wake of numerous protests from the sector. However in mid-2015, the firm returned to Barcelona operating as a food-delivery service known as Uber Eats.
In March 2016, Uber made a comeback in the Spanish capital in the form of UberX, which sees users put in touch with professional drivers holding passenger transport vehicle (VTC) licenses, which fall under different regulations from the taxi sector.
Among the complaints of the taxi sector is the practice of VTC drivers picking up passengers in contravention of the rules. By law, such vehicles can only collect clients who have booked them previously. “They make clandestine stops, near busy areas, with the app activated so that a vehicle will appear close to possible customers,” says Fedetaxi. But Cabify and Uber deny such practices. “Before we used to have to go back to the base after finishing a service, but now we are allowed to stop near the destination of the last customer,” explains an Uber driver.
The Spanish Taxi Federation (Fedetaxi) has called for the creation of a publicly run digital platform that would allow customers to book a taxi anywhere in Spain, along with public-private funding to help drivers leave the profession and retrain.
The ideas, outlined in a document called “Proposals in favor of the Public Taxi Service in Spain,” will be presented to Congress after Tuesday's march in central Madrid.
Fedetaxi says a publicly owned digital platform would improve “the quality and competitiveness” of Spain's taxi service and would be focused on tourism as a strategic sector.”
Spanish news agency EFE reports that center-right political party Ciudadanos has proposed convening a “negotiation table” between taxi drivers and companies such as Uber and Cabify, “so they can reach agreement” to resolve the ongoing dispute.
“We need to define rules that are the same for all,” said Ignacio Aguado, Ciudadanos' spokesman at Madrid City Hall.
“We support the new business models,” said Aguado, adding that his party would not “close the door on those people who want to do create new businesses.”

Harry Potter and the crisis of left-liberalism:
From an outside perspective, Harry Potter is a funny fantasy for liberals to cohere around. Going off to centuries-old boarding school where your mum and dad were Head Boy and Head Girl, where tolerance and broadmindedness consists of admitting that lower-class Muggles can occasionally have the same genetically-mediated gifts as the gentry, where the greatest possible action for a woman is to let herself be slain so her son can grow up to revenge himself on her killer, where ignorance of the supernatural is a form of willful self-delusion,a pathetic blindness to the real forces that move the world, where all the kids eat Merry Olde England foods like Roast Beef and Kidney Pie and Yorkshire Pudding all the time, all sounds more reactionary than progressive. But if contemporary liberalism is the ideology of imperial academia, funneled through media and non-profits and governmental agencies but responsible ultimately only to itself, the obsession with Harry Potter makes a lot more sense.
(JTA) — Israel said it was “deeply disappointed” with France's U.N. Security Council vote for Palestinian statehood.
Aviv Shir-On, the Israeli Foreign Ministry's deputy director for Europe, communicated Israel's disappointment on Friday in a meeting with Patrick Maisonnave, France's ambassador to Israel, according to news reports.
A Jordanian bid to pass a resolution on Palestinian statehood failed this week to garner the necessary nine out of 15 votes necessary for adoption. The United States promised it would veto the resolution if it crossed that threshold.
France was among the eight nations voting in favor of the resolution. In the past, European nations abstained from voting for Palestinian statehood.
Maisonnave told Shir-On that the French vote was aimed at keeping the Palestinians from joining the International Criminal Court, where they may seek war crimes charges against Israel, Haaretz reported.
The Palestinians submitted an application to join the court on Wednesday, a day after the failed U.N. vote.

Aerospace 3d printing is very promising for use in on-site creation of objects in space. NASA's plans include the 3D printing of tools, spare parts, and structural components. However, NASA is also interested in creating biomaterials in space.The space agency is funding Diana Gentry and Lynn Rothschild from Stanford University, to research the 3D printing of biomaterials such as wood. The idea is to use 3D printing to by-pass the steps of growing a tree, cutting it down, and processing it into a wood product. This would mean that astronauts can take the building blocks of different biomaterials into space rather than the entire organism in order to produce items like wood panels and silk. These products are the non-living items made by the biomaterials.
Lynn Rothschild and Diana Gentry believe that they can 3D print cellular arrays that will secrete organic materials such as silk, rubber, and cellulose. Cells will be placed in a gelling solution and then printed through a piezoelectric print head into a three dimensional pattern. They are not attempting to place organics into a pattern to induce cellular growth, but rather, are trying to trigger cells into becoming a material of their choice. If they can establish proof of concept, they hope to produce unique, exotic materials such as carbon reinforced wood or wood infused with copper nano-wires.
One very important biomaterial for astronauts is food. For long duration space missions such as a round trip to Mars, food storage is critical. Refrigeration is too resource intensive, and processed packaged food that can remain viable for 5 years, will contain degraded nutrients. In addition, lack of menu variety suppresses the appetite which leads to health issues. Consequently, NASA is looking at 3D printing of food as a possible solution because long term storage of the nutrients used in a printer is simpler than storage of actual food. A printer also solves the problem of menu variety. Anjan Contractor from Texas-based Systems & Materials Research Corporation has demonstrated the concept by 3D printing pizza. He is funded by a $125,000 grant from NASA.
A 14-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of making a copycat hoax bomb threat after dozens of similar calls were made to schools around the country.
West Midlands Police said the youth was detained by officers after a call made to a school in the Great Barr area of Birmingham on Wednesday was traced to a nearby phone box. CCTV inquiries then identified the teenager - who is not being linked to other hoax calls - as a suspect.
Thousands of students were evacuated from schools across Birmingham, south-west London, Paris, Amsterdam and Tokyo today following reports of 'security threats'.

Today signalled the third wave of school bomb scares in just over a week, and comes just two days after a Russian Twitter group was thought to be behind a series of bomb threats which saw thousands of pupils evacuated from 14 schools in Britain and six in Paris.
At least five Paris high schools were evacuated after bomb threats were made for the second time this week.
According to local reports, callers claimed to be threatening to turn up at schools armed with bombs and guns.
Police are investigating calls made to 14 schools in the West Midlands this morning making bomb threats – but officers said there was 'no credible threat to schools receiving bomb hoax calls in the West Midlands'.
Just after 8am dozens of calls were made to schools and colleges across the region making the threat.
It follows similar phone threats to schools in the West Midlands in the past week.
Detective Inspector Colin Mattinson from West Midlands Police, added: 'At this stage there is nothing to suggest there is any credible threat to any of the schools.
'Our response officers have been sent to the locations to ensure there is no threat to anyone's safety and support the schools.
'A police investigation is on-going to find the person responsible for these calls.'
A spokesman for the Met Police said the bomb threats were warning of 'suspicious devices' being placed in schools - but the calls were being treated by officers as 'malicious communications'.
Ursuline High School in Wimbledon confirmed a bomb threat had been made this morning and all students had been evacuated before sixth form pupils were sent home.

According to the Dutch Telegraaf, false bomb threats closed three schools in the capital today, causing mayhem.
One source told the Telegraaf up to five schools in the Dutch capital were threatened, however 'no explosives were found'.
In Tokyo's busy Shibuya Ward, some 800 people were evacuated from the British School and neighboring buildings according to theJapan Times.
Local reports claim an emergency evacuation order was issued at the international school.
Teachers at a school which was targeted by a bomb hoax evacuated pupils to a Premier League football stadium. While most students were evacuated to car parks and playgrounds, pupils from Sandwell Academy were sent to the home of nearby West Bromwich Albion
A total of 14 schools in the West Midlands received the threats which have caused chaos across Britain in recent days.
But while most students were evacuated to car parks and playgrounds today, pupils from Sandwell Academy were sent to the home of nearby West Bromwich Albion.
One student tweeted pictures of his classmates sat in their uniform in one of the stands of The Hawthorns ground.
In the images teachers can be seen standing near the pitch while the pupils sit in the seats usually reserved for supporters of the Premier League club.
He tweeted: 'Bomb scare at my sixth form! We got evacuated to the west brom stadium.'
Taking to its Twitter account the school, which is situated across the road from the West Brom stadium, also confirmed students were sitting in the stands.
They tweeted: 'Sandwell Academy safely evacuated all staff and students are safe in the Hawthorns stadium.'
On Tuesday, children were removed from six schools in Birmingham, four in London and four in Cornwall.
Exactly one week earlier, three West Midlands schools were evacuated when they received what turned out to be hoax calls.
A group using the Twitter handle @Ev4cuati0nSquad appeared to be behind the false threats.
A Twitter account called 'Evacuators 2k16' claimed responsibility for the threats, saying they intend to cause 'mayhem'.
The profile for @Ev4cuati0nSquad, which has now been suspended, says: 'We are 6 individuals based internationally.' Despite the account being closed down, the threats continued today.
A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'We are aware of the ongoing incident, police are looking into it and we are monitoring the situation.
'Nothing is more important than the safety of our children, where any school is subject to such a threat, real or otherwise, there are clear emergency arrangements in place that have been agreed with police and the local authority.
'We trust schools to follow those.'
People took to Twitter to warn people about the closures. The Department for Education said it was 'aware of the ongoing incident' and was monitoring the situation

A statement on the Ursuline High School website said the Year 11 parents' evening had to be cancelled following the closure: 'We have had a bomb threat at the school this morning. All students have been safely evacuated.
'We ask that parents do not attend or collect students. All students have been informed of the current situation.
'We are awaiting the police dog team to search the school.'
While it re-opened later in the afternoon, a statement on Bishop Gilpin's website said this morning: 'Bishop Gilpin is closed this morning due to a threat made against Ricards Lodge.
'We have received official clearance to reopen this afternoon. Children will be welcome in school from 1.30pm onwards.
'Children should make their way to class as they would in the morning. Gates will be staffed.'

A spokesman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said: 'Police take hoaxes extremely seriously.
'They divert police resources and cause disruption and alarm to the public.'
Councillor Martin Whelton, Merton Council Cabinet Member for Education and Pollards Hill Labour councillor took to Twitter to update his followers on which schools which had been evacuated.
He tweeted: 'I understand three schools in Merton have been evacuated following a security alert - [Ricards, Ursuline and Harris].
'Everyone has been safely evacuated & the police are investigating.
'Hopefully it will be resolved shortly.'
With Paris still on high alert following November's terror attacks, threats in the city are being taken seriously. This map shows the schools around the city which have been evacuated

Story highlights Pentagon identifies six airmen killed in crash
Six U.S. Air Force members and five civilians died
Taliban claims responsibility, but U.S. military says it doesn't believe enemy fire was involved
Washington (CNN) Eleven people were killed when a U.S. C-130 plane crashed in Afghanistan early Friday morning, the U.S. military said.
Everyone aboard -- six U.S. Air Force members and five civilians -- died in the incident, the U.S. military said.
The Pentagon on Saturday identified the airmen as Capt. Jonathan J. Golden, 33, of Camarillo, California; Capt. Jordan B. Pierson, 28, of Abilene, Texas; Staff Sgt. Ryan D. Hammond, 26, of Moundsville, West Virginia; Senior Airman Quinn L. Johnson-Harris, 21, of Milwaukee; Senior Airman Nathan C. Sartain, 29, of Pensacola, Florida; and Airman 1st Class Kcey E. Ruiz, 21, of McDonough, Georgia.
Golden, Pierson, Hammond and Johnson-Harris were assigned to the 39th Airlift Squadron, Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. Sartain and Ruiz were assigned to the 66th Security Forces Squadron, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts.
It is not yet known what caused the crash at Jalalabad Airport near the Afghan-Pakistani border and whether hostile fire was involved, though the U.S. military in Afghanistan believes the latter to be unlikely.

From Frederick Douglass and Edith Wharton, to Mark Twain and Allen Ginsberg, the list of these most influential writers truly goes on and on. They are so notable that if you visit the National Portrait Gallery here in Washington, D.C., you will see portraits of most of these writers on display (in fact, earlier this fall, the museum was offering an Atlantic-themed tour of their collection). Yet until today, most of these authors were represented on this site solely by their names—no bios or portraits were displayed for them, unlike our contemporary authors.
To commemorate them, and our 160 years, we've addressed that lack. Below you'll find a selection of some of the greats from our past, with their updated bios and portraits, alongside links to their coverage. We hope you enjoy this author-themed tour of our history.

Beme had a relatively short history, and was defined as much by who was making it as what it did. Neistat first unveiled the app for iOS in July 2015, and it was very much a reflection of the document-everything strategy from his daily video blogs at the time. Its signature trick was the ability to record 4-second clips just by putting your phone to your chest (to cover the proximity sensor), theoretically removing the barrier between you and whatever you were experiencing. With a massive potential audience (Neistat has millions of YouTube subscribers), Beme didn't have much trouble getting some initial uptake.
The problem: it faced both sagging interest and fierce competition. It wasn't until June 2016 that a finished public release arrived, and there were major interface revamps as the Beme crew tried to figure out an interface that would keep users hooked. Neistat helped spike demand whenever he mentioned the app in his blogs, but use tended to fade soon afterward. And how was Beme going to lure users away from Instagram and Snapchat, both of which have close-enough video sharing features and much larger communities?
There are some upsides. It's entirely likely that the lessons learned from Beme will rub off on whatever the developers do for CNN. And even if they don't, the app may teach other developers a thing or two: having a famous name attached to your project can help its chances, but it still needs to be polished and engaging enough to stand on its own merits.
After ex-UFC champ Rashad Evans turned him down, Hector Lombard has a fight.
Lombard (34-5-1 MMA, 3-3 UFC) is targeted to meet Anthony Smith (27-12 MMA, 3-2 UFC) at a UFC event scheduled for Aug. 19, according to multiple people with knowledge of the booking, who requested anonymity because the fight has not yet been made public.
The event could serve as UFC 215, though it has not officially been confirmed. UFC President Dana White recently told the “UFC Unfiltered” podcast that Seattle could host, presumably at KeyArena where the promotion has previously visited.
In a conversation last month with MMAjunkie, Lombard vented about not being able to get a fight. He said ex-light heavyweight champ Rashad Evans (19-6-1 MMA, 14-6-1 UFC) had turned him down, and other opponents had yet to materialize.
Now, the former Bellator champ and UFC welterweight hopes to rebound after an 0-3 skid, with a win over Josh Burkman overturned due to a positive drug test. Lombard shrugged off a run at 170 pounds in favor of his longtime middleweight division, yet was unable to get in the win column after suffering a knockout loss to Dan Henderson and losing a decision to ex-welterweight champ Johny Hendricks in February.
For Smith, it's a chance to solidify a recent surge in the octagon. In April, the MMA vet earned a dramatic comeback win by knocking out “The Ultimate Fighter 23” winner Andrew Sanchez with just over a minute left in their UFC on FOX 24 meeting in April. That built on a “Performance of the Night” win over Elvis Mutapcic at The Ultimate Fighter 24 Finale.

spiked is about as pro-freedom of movement as it is possible to get. Never mind Romanians and Bulgarians, we think even Africans should have the freedom to travel through, work and settle in Western Europe. So you might expect us to have enjoyed the kicking David Cameron received over the past week for his anti-immigrant posturing, from commentators and campaigners claiming to be on the side of migrants to Britain. But we didn't. On the contrary, the assaults on Cameron over his allegedly fiery rhetoric revealed how warped, even undemocratic, the pro-immigration stance has become, and how urgently we need a new, fresh, properly liberal defence of free movement.
Much about the anti-Cameron storm didn't add up. The PM was attacked after proposing that newly arrived immigrants should not automatically qualify for welfare benefits. He was accused of stirring up unfounded fears about Britain's welfare larder being plundered by Romanians and Bulgarians, who will have freer movement around Europe in the new year, when actually the vast majority of such Eastern migrants are fit, healthy and keen to work. This is true. It is indeed daft to fret over the alleged scrounging instincts of a foreign population who, if those from its number who are already here are anything to go by, will labour, nurse and serve for wages. But the strange thing about the Cam-bashing is that those who spearheaded it are not only far from being in favour of freedom of movement – they also actually agree with Cameron on curbing new migrants' benefits. So Labour's Yvette Cooper made waves when she claimed Cameron was ‘panicking over Romanian and Bulgarian workers'. But when you dug down under the Cooper-cheering headlines, it became clear that she supports curbing benefits for new migrants – in fact, Labour thought of it first. ‘The prime minister is playing catch-up. Why has it taken him eight months to copy Labour's proposal?', she said. Even some of the more excoriating newspaper editorials were sympathetic to Cameron's central idea. The Independent‘s leader was a hit with tweeting lefties, with its slamming of Cam for being ‘neurotic' about immigration and spreading ‘hysteria' about Eastern Europeans; yet is also said this: Cameron's proposals are ‘not without merit' and ‘it is not unreasonable to minimise the temptation [to migrants] of Britain's welfare and healthcare provisions'.
The most striking example of Cameron being slated over his immigration-talk by someone who is hardly a friend to immigrants was when EU commissioner László Andor got stuck in. Andor, the EU's man on employment, social affairs and inclusion, got British-based critics of Cameron all excited when he warned that Britain risks becoming the ‘nasty country' of Europe as a result of its ‘hysteria' over immigration. Cameron should give a ‘more accurate' picture of the likely levels and impact of Romanian and Bulgarian migration to Britain, he said. So here we have a man who works for an organisation whose stringent, unforgiving anti-African immigration policies have led to the deaths of hundreds of migrants on the coasts of southern Europe lecturing Britain on how it talks about immigration. Being told off about one's bad attitude to immigration by a Brussels-based suit is like being lectured about one's drinking habits by Shane McGowan. So if the loud critics of Cameron are actually in agreement with him – either on the specifics of curbing benefits or on the general idea that migration must be more tightly policed – what is pumping their bluster? What is it about Cameron's comments that caused them to bash out editorials or press releases attacking his neurosis and hysteria? What they're really worried about is not the impact that Cameron's proposals will have on Romanians and Bulgarians, but the impact they will have on Brits, on the apparently mushy, malleable minds of those less well-read sections of Britain with their innate hostility to migrants and their latent desire to attack foreigners. What outraged Cam's critics was not that he suggested making migrants' lives a little harder, but that he suggested it in front of the children – us, the masses of Britain, who are apparently too politically immature to hear such talk. The fear of a rash public reaction to Cameron's comments ran through virtually all the anti-Cameron commentary and statements. So that Independent editorial which generally agreed with Cameron's proposals but nonetheless accused him of stoking ‘hysteria' argued that the PM was ‘fanning the flames of misconception when he should be dampening them'. He was clearly angling for a ‘quick win with the public' – because the public hates immigrants, of course – when ‘his job is to lead, not merely to follow'. This is what László Andor was getting at, too, when he said Cameron was formulating his new policy on immigration ‘under pressure… under [the] hysteria which sometimes happens in the UK'. That is, the PM is pandering to the inflamed, hysterical misconceptions harboured by your average Brit when he should be shooting them down.
The idea that the public is profoundly anti-immigrant, and possibly even racist, is widespread. ‘Voters will love it', said one Guardian columnist of Cameron's proposals. A writer for the New Statesman said Cameron was ‘stok[ing] public anger and distrust on immigration', and in the process he is ‘threaten[ing] the stability of our political system' because enraged anti-immigrant voters will now turn to smaller, far-right political parties in order to express their racial frustrations. ‘[M]ore and more voters are moving from the mainstream to the margins, guided by a toxic and – to be frank – nasty group of opinion-makers [who are] sowing the seeds of xenophobia, protest and division', said the NS writer. In short, like cattle the latently racist public is being led into unpredictable pastures. Another broadsheet critic of Cameron accused him of ‘fanning the flames of xenophobia and dividing our society'. This twitchy fear of what horrors Cameron's words might unleash among the basically racist throng was summed up in the oft-repeated phrase ‘dog whistle politics'. Numerous commentators accused Cameron of ‘pure dog whistling', of using ‘the politics of the dog whistle' on the issue of immigration in order to shore up his public support. Think about how insulting that phrase is. It refers to the process by which a mainstream politician emits a shrill noise which will not be heard by Us, the decent folk, but will be heard by Them, the xenophobes, the prejudiced, the dogs, effectively, of public life and mass society, who are just waiting for the order from their master before unleashing their inner anti-immigrant fury. The illiberal liberals of the anti-Cameron set are really upset with him because they think he has potentially unleashed the dogs of hatred.
A mafia clan has been in charge of one of Italy's largest migrant reception centers for an entire decade, police have revealed. Dozens have been arrested in connection with the scheme, which reportedly led to the clan pocketing millions.
The Arena clan, part of the Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta mafia, reportedly made millions of euros through its running of the Sant'Anna Cara facility in Isola di Capo Rizzuto, one of Italy's largest migrant reception centers.
According to police, the clan “controlled, for profit, the management of the reception center,” which has held as many as 1,500 migrants at a time. It has maintained control of the facility for over 10 years.

Sixty-eight people were taken into custody following an early morning raid on Monday.
“Over 500 agents overnight arrested 68 people...accused of mafia association, extortion, carrying illegal weapons, fraud, embezzlement to the detriment of the state, (and) theft,” police in Catanzaro said in a Monday statement, as quoted by the Local.
Among those arrested was Leonardo Sacco, the head of the Catholic Misericordia association which officially runs the center.
Police believe Sacco was responsible for the clan winning contracts for supplying catering and other services to the center, which made it possible to pocket millions of euros of EU funding destined for migrants.
Italy gives the migrant center some €16 million (US$17.5 million) a year to house and feed those living at the facility, according to Reuters.
A local priest, Edoardo Scordio, was also detained, according to Italian media.
In addition to running Italy's largest migrant center, the mafia clan also provided food services to a reception center on the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has been at the frontline for the steady influx of migrants arriving from North Africa.
The head of the Italian parliament's anti-mafia commission, Rosy Bindi, hailed the operation.
“The Cara of Isola Capo Rizzuto had become a money printing operation for organized crime thanks to the complicity of those who ran the center,” she said.

“This operation shows the ability of the mafia to take advantage of the weaknesses and fragility of our times with its predatory and parasitic approach,” Bindi added.
The 'Ndrangheta mafia has been dubbed one of Italy's most powerful organized crime groups and one of Europe's largest cocaine importers.
The Sant'Anna Cara migrant center had been flagged by Italian media in the past. In 2015, L'Espresso magazine published a report which alleged that managers at the facility were pocketing funds destined for migrants.
Crotone prefecture, where the center is located, said in 2014 that it appeared the number of people registered at the facility had been inflated, with management pocketing funds for ‘ghost' migrants. That number, according to a police report cited by L'Espresso, was estimated at €10,000 ($10,969) a day.
In 2013, a health inspection revealed that migrants were being given tiny portions of out-of-date food, and that the facility was housing 70 unaccompanied minors who went barefoot and slept in a hangar with only two toilets.
Italy has been one of the countries the hardest hit by the worst migrant crisis since World War II, due to its easy proximity for those arriving by boat from North Africa. More than half a million migrants have reached the country since 2014, most of whom crossed the Mediterranean Sea from Libya.
Major Nelson's Q&A about Xbox One: All the question and answers
As mentioned yesterday, Major Nelson held an online Q&A regarding the new Xbox One. If you have submited a question through the online form, it's possible that he responded to it. There are a lot of things we already knew, but there are also a few new information. Thanks to Gematsu, we now have a full list of all questions and answers below.
Q: Could you please provide some more clarity as to how users will be able to play used games on the Xbox One?
A: We are still months away from the launch of Xbox One & policy decisions are still being finalized.
Q: How long ago where you're talking about Xbox One within the Xbox team?
A: We've been thinking about Xbox One for a few years now.
Q: Could you clarify the situation regarding multiple accounts on ONE console. My boyfriend and I both have our own accounts. Will we be made to pay twice for 1 game in order for us both to use our own accounts?
A: As I noted earlier we're still working on some of the policies… but our goal is that it would work like it works today on Xbox 360.
Q: Why do you think gamers should buy Xbox One?
A: Today's gamers want access to great games… the Xbox One will have great games powered by Xbox LIVE. We've worked hard to create the ultimate all-in-one console. BTW: We have a LOT more gaming news to share at E3 🙂
Q: What's behind the name “Xbox One,” and how did you convince the entire world that it was going to be called the Xbox 720?
A: Xbox One because it is the ultimate all-in-one entertainment system. As far 720 is concerned…that was a name the community came up with. We never considered that name.
Q: What do you believe separates the Xbox one from the PlayStation 4, gaming related?
A: Well, Xbox LIVE for one. We're very proud of the service that we've built. 48 million people agree with us. That is just one of the things. Now, I have not had a chance to spend time with the console, so we'll have to wait until their final product launches before I can really comment.
Q: There seems to be some confusion in the media on how frequently users must connect to the internet to use the Xbox One. Will this be as frequent as once a day as rumored [actually, a Microsoft exec said this] or will we be able to use the console for extended periods of time without an active connection?
A: No. It does not have to be always connected but it does require an internet connection.
Q: What are Microsoft doing to welcome smaller, independent developers to the Xbox One?
A: We're working on a plan for Xbox One is a platform that allows all creators, including those who work on games and apps, regardless of team size, funding, biz model, etc. to be a part of the future of Xbox One.
Q: How expensive is this system gonna be?
A: We have not announced price yet… look for details on that later this year.
Q: Will there be headset bundled with every Xbox One?
A: We'll have details on accessories at E3… it's only 18 days away now.
Q: Which areas of the Xbox One will you be focusing on at your E3 presentation?
A: Games. Games. GAMES 🙂
Q: You wanted to share with us the controller. Can you maybe list some of the awesome things that you have updated in it? Also, what are the two buttons where “Start” and “Back” used to be? Lastly, how does the new battery pack work?
A: The new controller is awesome I have spent a lot of time with it. If you like the Xbox 360 controller, you'll LOVE this controller. We have made over 40 improvements in the new design. Regarding the Start and Back buttons, they'll perform similar functions but right now we don't have final names for them yet. The controller takes 2 AA batteries. More details at E3.
Q: Will my achievements earned on Xbox 360 be visible on Xbox One?
A: Yes, your achievements and Gamerscore will carry over to Xbox One.
Q: Will there be any support for 3D or 4K?
A: Indeed. Xbox One supports BOTH 3-D and 4K.
Q: Can I opt to exclusively use the controller and NOT Kinect?
A: Decision up to game creators.
Q: What's the word on backwards compatibility with 360 games?
A: Xbox One hardware is not compatible with Xbox 360 games. We designed Xbox One to play an entirely new generation of games. Games are architected to take full advantage of the state of the art processors and infinite power of the cloud.
Q: Does the new Kinect handle smaller rooms better than the Kinect 360?
A: It does. It has a much wider field of view which will allow it work in smaller spaces. A 1080p wider field of view even!
Q: Do you plan to make Xbox LIVE available worldwide, or it will remain available to a number of selected countries?
A: Good question… we are working hard at making Xbox LIVE available in as many regions as possible. Currently we are in 41 countries.
Q: What feedback have you received from devs about the console?
A: They are very excited for Xbox One and the power of Xbox LIVE that will power it…as well as the unique aspects of Kinect and SmartGlass they can tap into.
Q: Do you believe you've done enough to make the hardcore gamer happy while still appealing to a wider audience?
A: The hardcore gaming audience has given us some great feedback, and we watch that feedback carefully. I think they'll be happy after E3.
Q: Any specific examples of how the new Xbox LIVE power will help games?
A: Indeed… the new architecture allows developers to do processing in the cloud in really really smart ways. That will result in much richer gaming experiences than ever before. Again, more at E3.
Unemployment in America may have hit a forty-year low, but few Americans are taking comfort in numbers. According to a new poll, nearly three-quarters of Americans believe the U.S. economy is rigged.
A national study, conducted last May by Marketplace and Edison, asked 1,022 participants about numerous aspects of their financial lives, ranging from job hunts and medical bills to the date of their most recent family vacation. The survey results produced a grim portrait of economic anxiety that is crossing class, race, and political boundaries.
According to the survey, 32% of Americans say they lose sleep over their financial situation, and 48% of Americans believe the economy for the next generation of Americans will be worse than that of the present. Even more jarring is the finding that 71% of Americans believe “the economic system in the U.S. is rigged in favor of certain groups.” 61% of Hispanic and 71% of White/Other respondents shared this belief, while over 80% of African Americans agreed with the statement.
The respondents' outlook on the current political climate is just as bleak. 75% said they were “dissatisfied” or “angry” with elected officials in Washington, while 47% were “not satisfied at all” with this year's selection of candidates for president. Indeed, almost half of respondents believed that the choice of a Republican or Democrat for the White House would make “no difference” to their personal financial situation.
“Rigged” is enjoying its moment in American parlance. Democratic nominee Bernie Sanders' November 2015 “Rigged Economy” ad first used the term to blame the government and Wall Street for eradicating the middle class. “This is an economy that is rigged and meant to benefit those on top,” Sanders stated at a rally in Los Angeles last August. “We need an economy that works for all people.” Fellow outsider Donald Trump followed suit, branding the American economy as well as the GOP nomination system under the same adjective. At a rally in New York this past April, Trump declared, “If you think about it, the economy is rigged. The banking system is rigged. There are a lot of things that are rigged in this world of ours, and that's why a lot of you haven't had an effective wage increase in 20 years, folks.”
Since survey respondents represented a roughly equal mix of conservative and liberal values, their collective opinions concerning the “rigged” economy is all the more telling. With economic—not to mention political—polarization threatening to grow ever higher, it appears that Americans have found at least one topic on which (almost) everybody agrees.
Marathon wisdom told you it was too rainy, too slippery, and too warm for fast times at this morning's Berlin Marathon, but Eliud Kipchoge refused to be overcome, either by the conditions or by his competitors. He won a race against perhaps the strongest field assembled in the past decade, even after a surprise attack by a debutant marathoner, Guye Adola, threatened to spoil his day. Kipchoge eventually missed the world record by 35 seconds, finishing in 2:03:32—a miraculous time in the circumstances. In both the fact and the manner of his victory, he has laid to rest any debate about who is the best marathon runner of this generation.
Berlin woke up in a cloud. In the forested Tiergarten, where the race starts, it was 57 degrees—significantly too hot for the fastest times—and the air was thick and moist. The official weather forecast said it was 99 percent humidity, but it's hard to imagine how they missed that final one percent. The air was like soup. Humidity is a problem for elite athletes.
If the atmosphere was thick, so was the sense of expectation. As the three-star athletes—Eliud Kipchoge, who ran 2:00:25 in Nike's Breaking2 experiment earlier this year; Wilson Kipsang, the only man ever to win New York, London, and Berlin; and Kenenisa Bekele, world and Olympic record holder in 5,000 and 10,000 meters, and last year's Berlin winner—warmed up in front of the start line, they betrayed their states of mind. Bekele looked tight with nerves as he stretched out his arms above his head, while Kipsang and Kipchoge ran some fast sprints and smiled easily to the crowd. Kipsang's grin cracked briefly when the starter announced his rival, Kipchoge, as “the world's best marathon runner.”
Thick Air and Slippery Turns
From the start, Kipchoge, wearing a white singlet, black half-tights, and red shoes, tucked in behind the three elite pacers, who had been asked to lead the fastest athletes to halfway in a previously unthinkable split time of 60 minutes and 50 seconds. The rain soon became intense, and it became obvious that nobody was going to run so fast for the first half. Simply turning a corner required care and concentration. Every time the lead pack did so, they slowed considerably. As the rain intensified, Gideon Kipketer, the rangy pacemaker (and Kipchoge's training partner) screwed his face up into the weather.
The lead pack, which included not just the three big names but the Ethiopian debutant Adola and the Kenyan Vincent Kipruto, made halfway in 61:30, a second or two outside world record pace. In the conditions, it was an excellent split. The weather also started to lift a little, and Kipchoge looked increasingly comfortable.
Bekele, though, was dropped from the lead pack at halfway, unable to live with the pace. He did not finish the race. By 17 miles, only one pacemaker had survived—Sammy Kitwara. He dropped out at the 30-kilometer (18.6 mile) mark, and so—to everyone's surprise—did Wilson Kipsang, clutching his stomach.
Almost everyone was suffering. Not only was the road slippery, but the athletes' clothes were sticking to the skin, and—most importantly—all the runners would have found it hard to regulate their temperature. One of the limiting factors in marathon running is an athlete's ability to dissipate the heat generated while synthesizing the energy needed to run so fast. Mostly, body heat is lost through sweating. But, the thicker and warmer the air, the harder that process becomes.
For the final seven and a half miles, it was Kipchoge, the master, versus Adola, the newcomer. Adola, who is taller and has a scruffier gait, seemed relaxed, and Kipchoge looked actively irritated by the close attention the Ethiopian was paying him. Kipchoge asked Adola more than once to move either in front or behind him. Adola continued as he was, shoulder to shoulder with the senior man. As they jostled, the world record drifted away. At the 35-kilometer (21.7 mile) marker, Kipchoge was around six seconds outside world record pace. But, oddly, it was at this moment that Kipchoge began to smile. Battle was joined.
Race to the Finish
At around 23 miles, Adola attacked, opening a gap of 10 meters and moving to the other side of the road as if to accentuate the distance between him and Kipchoge. The Kenyan responded, and seemed to be reeling Adola in, but the Ethiopian pressed again. Even as the world record drifted toward impossibility, nobody who was watching the race cared. This was thrilling sport, a true duel. With two miles to go, Kipchoge seemed visibly to muster reserves of energy for a final attempt to break Adola, and at the final drinks station at 40 kilometers (24.8 miles), he caught him, and then blew past him.
Kipchoge finished with a kick. When he crested the line, he looked as happy as a lottery winner. He hugged his coach, Patrick Sang, and saluted the crowd. Sang is not normally given to hyperbole, but his pride, minutes after the race had ended, was uncontainable.
“In these terrible conditions, two-oh-three is amazing,” Sang told me. “There was the mental challenge, the physical challenge, the environmental challenge… He is one of the great runners.”
I'd go a step further. Eliud Kipchoge has never broken the world record, but I've now watched four races in which he was in shape to do so—the London Marathon of 2016, which he won in 2:03:05, the Rio Olympic Marathon which he won in 2:08:44, the Breaking2 race at Monza which he won in 2:00:25, and today's Berlin Marathon. In each case, he would have ripped chunks out of the world record in perfect conditions. But he has either been running on a slow course, or in slow conditions, and the title of world-record holder has evaded him. That's marathon racing. In this sport, you have to be good and lucky.
Kipchoge may never break the world record now. The years, and the marathons, are piling up. He would never admit this, but it's possible his chance has come and gone. In the final reckoning, it won't matter. Nobody who watched Kipchoge win those four races could be in any doubt of his superiority. Today's race was a reminder not just of his physical talents but of his mental fortitude. World record or no world record, he is the greatest.

A group of Democrats sent a letter to House Democratic leaders urging them to extend expiring tax breaks for all income levels.
Washington (CNN) - Thirty-one House Democrats, most of whom face tough re-election bids this fall, have signed a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer urging them to extend expiring tax breaks for all income levels, including the wealthy.
Pelosi and other House Democratic leaders have made it clear they support President Obama's proposal to vote on a bill that only renews tax breaks for those making $250,000 and under. But with the midterm elections less than two months away, leaders have not yet decided whether they will schedule a vote on the legislation before voters go to the polls.
The letter–written by Utah Rep. Jim Matheson, Illinois Rep. Melissa Bean, Virginia Rep. Glenn Nye and Michigan Rep. Gary Peters–states that after listening to economists, small businesses and families over recent weeks they are concerned that "raising any taxes right now could negatively impact economic growth."
"We believe in times of economic recovery it makes good sense to maintain things as they are in the short term, to provide families and businesses the certainty required to plan and make sound budget decisions. Providing this certainty will give small businesses, the backbone of our economic recovery, confidence and stability," the lawmakers wrote.
CNN reported that the four authors were circulating a draft of the letter earlier this week. But with more than 30 Democrats now signed on to the final letter, Democratic leaders will face increasing pressure to address the concerns of these moderate members.
Republican congressional leaders have been making similar arguments, pushing for a two year freeze on all current tax rates.
Earlier on Wednesday, Hoyer told reporters he could consider proposals to extend tax cuts for higher wage earners, but he also stressed his strong support for just renewing the middle income tax breaks.
Later Wednesday, Hoyer released a written statement noting he was simply saying he was willing to talk to others about their positions.
"Unfortunately, the reports of my answer implied a willingness to support an extension of Bush policies," he wrote. "That is incorrect."
Alternative energy is a growing market, and though many states offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives to promote clean energy, it can still prove to be an expensive proposition.
It generally also requires plugging your energy source into the grid so you're not left in the dark when the wind calms or the sun lingers behind clouds.
Here is a roundup of solutions that can help power a home.
Solar
Solar is, in some ways, the easiest solution, or at least one of the most accessible. Plugging into the sun requires photovoltaic solar panels, an inverter, and batteries that can store a bit of any excess energy for a rainy day.
Performance varies regionally, of course, with states in the southern and southwestern regions enjoying the most days of sun per year.
Solar panels require little maintenance once installed and can provide large amounts of electricity in fair weather. It can be expensive, however, even with incentives, and even when hooked up to batteries, it doesn't do much good when there's no sun for stretches at a time.
Resources
GetSolar has a database for finding a solar installer in your area. It's wise to compare quotes from several companies. Some installers prefer to install panels sold by their companies, while others will install any panels you purchase.
It's also possible to rent solar panels. One of the largest renters is Citizenrē REnU, which offers 1, 5 or 25-year contracts that include installation.
Wind
Wind energy is often associated with mammoth wind farms, but smaller sized turbines are also produced for backyard energy production.
The speed of the wind is the determining factor in whether wind power is the right solution for your home. Weather services can tell you what the average wind speed in your region is, but it can vary within a region.
Not surprisingly, bigger turbines can produce larger amounts of energy. A 10-kilowatt turbine can usually provide enough energy for a house and is usually around 100 feet tall with a 23-foot turbine.
As with solar, wind energy is climate-dependent so when the turbine's not turning, you might need a different energy source. Unlike solar, wind turbines have the added con of being built of out of moving parts that need regular maintenance.
Resources
A turbine large enough to power a home often requires a permit. The American Wind Energy Association offers a useful guide for going through the necessary steps to install your own turbine, as well as a list of wind gear providers.
If you're low on space or looking for a plug-and-play solution, try a personal wind turbine like Southwest Windpower's Air-X. It can produce up to 400 watts, enough to offset some lighting and appliance usage, and can be installed on top of a roof.
Alternatively, try Clarian's Jellyfish When it hits the market next year, i will be able to provide the same potential wattage and also feature the ability to power your home by plugging into any standard wall outlet.
If you're a do-it-yourselfer, find an old treadmill and take a stab at making your own as in this video:
Geothermal
Most geothermal energy is produced large scale, so single-home geothermal is usually limited to heating and cooling solutions. Still, considering how much energy indoor climate control can consume, geothermal heat pumps can significantly reduce your energy needs.
Geothermal heat pumps tap into the earth's stable temperature to regulate that in your home. The pump moves heat from the earth to your home in winter and pulls the heat inside your house outside in summer.
Most pumps are built simply so they require little, if any maintenance, and can be equipped with a household water heater as well.
Geothermal heat pumps are not a full-service solution, even for heating and cooling. Some models have been shown to reduce energy bills by up to 40%, which means you can't say goodbye to your utility company and be completely comfortable indoors.
Cost is another concern. A heat pump with enough capacity to keep a home cozy averages just shy of $8,000, but the drilling required to install it can be upwards of $30,000.
Resources
Because of the amount and depth of drilling involved, geothermal heat pumps are not typically a do-it-yourself project. To find a reliable contractor, check the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association‘s directory of accredited installers to find one in your area.
Micro hydro electricity
This one only works if you live near moving water, but it can be very effective. Installation requires running a pipe from a high area where water is flowing to a lower piece of ground. Energy is produced as water moves downhill and turns a turbine at the end of the pipe.
Some micro hydro systems have been capable of producing ten or even 100 times more power than wind or solar. Unlike wind and solar, it can run non-stop and overnight, so long as the water continues to flow. An inverter and batteries can be connected to store extra energy if needed.
As with wind, the turbine requires maintenance and has the potential to break. Also, the size and pressure of the stream affects its energy production, so a very small stream might not be enough to power an entire house. Small streams also carry the risk of drying up in summer or freezing in cold weather.
Resources
You'll probably need a contractor to install a micro hydro system. Many cities and states require anyone installing alternative energy sources to be a licensed electrician, especially if it connects to the grid. Although there isn't a national licensing organization for micro hydro installers in the U.S., a local search should or call to your utility company should point you in the right direction.
Or, if you know what you're doing and are as handy and patient as this guy, you can build your own micro hydro system.
Kössler, a joint venture between Siemens and Voith, makes several turbines designed for small power stations.
Energy Systems & Design also produces micro hydro equipment that can be used for a single home.
Fuel cells
Fuel cells use fuel and an oxidizing agent, typically hydrogen and oxygen, to produce heat and electricity. Inside the cell, he hydrogen's ions and electrons are separated. An electrolyte substance inside the cell lets ions pass through but blocks electrons, which travel through a wire instead, in the form of electricity. The remaining ions turn into water or carbon dioxide when they meet with oxygen.
Resources
Bloom Energy‘s relatively new Bloom Box, which we reported on earlier this year, might be one of the most talked about home fuel cell solutions, though with its current price tag of $700,000-$800,000, it's not exactly cheap.
Acumentrics manufactures fuel cells primarily for military use, but can also supply you with one for your home.
Most fuel cell companies don't sell directly to the public, so you'll have to search for an installer. FuelCellToday‘s directory can help you find one in your area.
The Department of Energy is working on developing best practices for safe hydrogen handling.
Biomass
Biomass for the home usually comes in the form of a stove used either for general home heating, or to heat water. Stoves are usually fueled by plants, including crops, trees, wood waste or grass. Biomass stoves do pollute the air, but many still consider them green because they contribute less pollution with fewer harmful chemicals than fossil fuels.
Resources
Those looking to buy a biofuel stove might try Bixby‘s MaxFire, which can be fueled with dry-shelled corn or wood pellets.
Bixby claims the stove can reduce heating costs by up to 50% and keep a typical home warm for about $1.50 per day. The stove ignites immediately with the push of a button and has eight heat level settings. When fuel is burned, the stove automatically pushes ash into a drawer that can be emptied without too much of a mess.
None of these solutions provide a fail-safe way to meet all your energy needs, but with blackouts from overburdened grids and severe weather conditions, neither do utility companies. It can be argued that some of these solutions are not entirely green, but even if they can't completely alleviate the need for fossil fuels, they can help reduce the amount we need.
Most states offer incentives for alternative energy investments, and the Department of Energy suggests additional ways to lower usage and costs and lists products that are currently eligible for federal tax credits.
Despite state incentives, installing alternative energy is still an expensive proposition for most, but it can pay off in the long run.

Although "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" consistently books the best hip-hop lineup of any late night show—one of the many perks of having The Roots as a house band—Kanye West has never made an appearance. Until now.
Joining esteemed guests Steve Harvey (no doubt to the chagrin of 'Ye's buddy Tyler, the Creator) and The Cast of "Duck Dynasty", Kanye stopped by to promote his upcoming tour. He performed Yeezus fan favorite "Bound 2," joined by Charlie Wilson and backed by The Roots.
Not only was it thrilling to see the song in a live setting, the performance offered a chance for Kanye to finally air out some grievances against Ray J with a special TV edit of the song's opening line:
"Brandy little sister lame and he knows it now/When a real brother hold you down you 'sposed to drown."
Earlier tonight, Jimmy Fallon the surprise performance on Twitter, undoubtedly pushing back the bed times of a few people who figured they could skip out on the "Duck Dynasty" interview and grab a few extra Zs:
We'll go ahead and say it was worth losing sleep over. Check it out below:

Vivian O'Connor was stunned to discover that her old rickety house on 6th Avenue in New Westminster was on the city's list of properties that automatically require heritage status assessments.
She was further dismayed when she found out that the heritage designation process, and the red tape that comes with it, had been deterring developers from purchasing and sub-dividing her property.
CBC Radio and Television are broadcasting live from New Westminster on Friday, as part of our month-long In Your Neighbourhood special project.
O'Connor considers her home a tear down.
"It's nothing pretty, it's not fancy, it's two houses glued together. It's just an old house," she said.
"There's no background, there's no famous people, it's not a house you'd find a plaque on."
O'Connor always considered the property to be an investment that she would sell for re-development, even when she purchased it back in 1996.
Previous Next
But a new policy passed by city council in 2011 stipulated that all homes older than 100 years must be reviewed by city staff and the Community Heritage Commission to see if they have heritage value. Until that determination is made, O'Connor is unable to sell the lot for re-development.
She says the initial interest in her property led her and her husband to purchase a home and 13-acre lot in Princeton.
Now, O'Connor has had to take out a line of credit to pay for both homes. Meanwhile, she has decreased the listing price of her property in an attempt to get out of the financial bind.
Preservation a 'community value'
For its part, the City of New Westminster says it's willing to work with O'Connor through its heritage revitalization program.
"Preservation of older houses is a strongly held community value in New Westminster," said Beverly Grieve, the city's director of development services.
Vivian O'Connor's wants to sub-divide her property on 6th Avenue in New Westminster, but the city says the house it has heritage value. (Vivian O'Connor)
"In the case of Ms. O'Connor, we let her know that if she were to preserve her building, the city would assist her in getting the lot subdivided and allow for the construction of a second house on that lot."
The bureaucracy and paperwork involved in the process leaves O'Connor balancing two mortgages and facing mounting debt. At this point, she says she doesn't have the time or money to participate in the city's heritage revitalization program.
"We're strapped. All the signs pointed to us making a quick sale because of the lot size and where it's placed," she said.
"We went out on a limb and bought another house, so now we owe a whole bunch of money that we should not have, gone into debt for, because we should have been able to sell this house by now."
The New Westminster Community Heritage Commission's next meeting is in November. The city says it will review O'Connor's application as soon as possible.
CBC is "In Your Neighbourhood". Join us for a live remote broadcast of CBC Radio One's 'The Early Edition' and 'On the Coast' in New Westminster at The Shops in New West (888 Carnarvon St.). CBC News Vancouver will also be on location and broadcasting live from around the city.
Rio 2016: Vladimir Putin says absence of Russian athletes devalues Games
Updated
President Vladimir Putin said the absence of top Russian competitors will "markedly lower" next month's Rio Games, as he met competitors set for Brazil and those barred over state-run doping.
Over 100 Russians have so far been banned from the Games, including track and field stars Yelena Isinbayeva and Sergey Shubenkov, who were among those meeting Putin at the Kremlin.
Two-time gold medallist pole vaulter Isinbayeva was seen breaking down in tears.
"It's obvious that the absence of Russian competitors -- leaders in many disciplines -- markedly lowers, and will lower the intensity of the fight and that means the spectacle at the upcoming events," Putin said in a speech.
"The other sportsmen understand that the quality of their medals will be different."
Putin blasted a decision to exclude the Russian track and field team and some other athletes as political and said it goes both "beyond the legal sphere and common sense".
A tearful Isinbayeva lashed out at the suspension by athletics' governing body, the IAAF, and thanked Putin for his support.
"They banned us without evidence, crudely and rudely," she said, before the team headed to a religious ceremony to be blessed by the influential head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill.
During the service, Patriarch Kirill said he would pray to help the athletes "put aside these difficult circumstances," Russian news agencies reported.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) sparked fierce criticism on Sunday when it resisted a blanket ban in favour of allowing individual sports federations to make the call on which Russians can go to Rio.
Federations rushing to vet Russian athletes
International sports federations are now scrambling to vet Russian athletes as time ticks down to the start of the Games on August 5.
Russian competitors are set to jet out to Brazil early Thursday but it still remains unclear how many of the 387-strong squad named last week will eventually compete.
Rowing's international governing body FISA was the latest to get tough with Russia, announcing that 22 of 28 Russian competitors had been banned under strict criteria imposed by the IOC.
That took the number of Russian competitors banned since Sunday to 41, in addition to 67 members of the track and field team excluded by the IAAF.
The IAAF on Wednesday reaffirmed that only one Russian athlete -- US-based long jumper Darya Klishina -- was eligible to compete because she lives and trains outside the Russian system.
In other sports there was some good news for Moscow as the world governing body for fencing said all 16 Russians down to compete had been cleared.
The head of Russia's trampolining federation, Nikolai Makarov, told TASS news agency that he had received "verbal permission" from the sport's international authorities for the team to take part.
The latest doping scandal to rock Olympic and Russian sport was triggered this month by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), whose report detailed an elaborate doping system directed by the Moscow sports ministry and used in more than 30 sports over four years.
Controversially, among the Russians banned is Yuliya Stepanova, the 800m runner who lifted the lid on systematic doping and corruption in Russian athletics.
Stepanova, who fled Russia and is reviled by many back home, is now making a last-gasp appeal against her IOC ban.
Her inclusion is backed by the IAAF and many anti-doping officials who have praised her whistleblowing efforts, but was nixed by an IOC ethics commission.
Four-time world breaststroke champion Yulia Efimova also plans to appeal her ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The IOC has received praise from Moscow but stinging criticism from elsewhere for failing to impose a total ban on Russia over shocking evidence of a state-organised system to cheat its way to glory in Olympic and world sport.
Germany's Olympic discus champion Robert Harting verbally attacked IOC president Thomas Bach, calling his compatriot "part of the doping system, not the anti-doping system".
Bach fired back that the decision to leave individual sports federations to decide which Russians could compete "respects the right of every clean athlete around the world," noting that would-be Russian Olympians must clear "the highest hurdles" to make the Games.

It's always nice to see people and things you haven't in a long time. We've had a nice bit of that in metal this year, haven't we? Bands we haven't seen in a while, new records that made our collections that much more exciting, and tours worth getting off our lazy asses to go see.
Personally, I've had a few nice surprises this year. Those lads and lady in Bolt Thrower returned to our shores to devastate us on a few tour dates and an awesome, albeit mildly interrupted, appearance at Maryland Deathfest. It was my first chance to see the band, and getting to experience the UK legends in the flesh was unforgettable. Carcass also appeared on that fest, and they even are headed back with a new album we'll talk more about in a few weeks. That might be the biggest surprise of the whole year, especially with how it sounds.
Another strong comeback comes via Gorguts, the Canadian masters of technical death metal that's been away 12 long years and missed out on a huge wave of new bands following in their footsteps, turning the sub-genre into something of a messy phenomenon. The world could have used this Luc Lemay-led band in order to have some proper direction of how this stuff is supposed to be done and how to prevent the style from having a soul. Yeah, these guys always have been a band to wow you with their prowess, but their music always had a heart and personality that helped it rise above just being a mind-blowing display of musicianship. Needless to say, this band was missed, and the announcement Gorguts would be revived with an interesting new lineup was music to our sick hearts, culminating in “Colored Sands,” the follow-up to “From Wisdom to Hate.”
Yes, Lemay remains your unquestioned leader, handling guitars and vocals and exposing his disgusting thoughts to the world. Joining him is a virtual all-star cast of insanely accomplished underground metal musicians including guitarist Kevin Hufnagel (Dysrhythmia, Vaura), bassist Colin Marston (Krallice, Behold … the Arctopus, Indricothere), and drummer John Longstreth (Origin, Dim Mak) who practically turn Gorguts into a supergroup. They definitely hold their own to maintain this band's legend and capably push the group into the future.
“Le Toit du Monde” kicks of this nine-track, 62-minute ripper, and you know within the first few seconds how much this song is going to rule. And that's exactly what it does over its running time, blasting you with devious growls, slick and tricky guitar work that both shreds and astonishes, and portions that dive right into the pools of prog death. “A Ocean of Wisdom” follows, starting as a harsh, ugly demonstration of power but eventually finding time for atmosphere and melody. It's mystical and airy at times, but it's only temporary as scorching soloing follows, and the dry thrashing makes you feel like you're crawling through an unforgiving desert. “Forgotten Arrows” is interesting because it keeps building up and subsiding, letting the guys work through the madness, visiting prog, thrash, and death equally. There is a lot of weirdness and dizzying playing, but it's always fun and invigorating. The title track has a long, introspective opening, and after it establishes itself, it drops 50 tons of cement on you, keeping it thick, suffocating, and bruising. The dynamics of this thing are just breath-taking.
“The Battle of Chamdo” is the oddball, and instrumental built on synth-based strings and sweeping over like a piece soundtracking the opening credits to a gory action film where ancient forces are looking to shed blood. “Enemies of Compassion” is rightfully titled because it takes no prisoners and looks to exact as much damage as humanly possible. “Ember's Voice” has a weird, slurry opening that sounds like the song was treated with a nice, thick cough syrup, and though it can be sci-fi-laced and loopy, it's also pulverizing and mean. “Absconders” runs 9:09 and begins crushing with reckless abandon, paving the way for crushing, off-kilter mashing, a lumbering trip out of control down hill, and a savagery that sounds like it's being carried out by a deadly machine with zero compassion. Closer “Reduced to Silence” ramps up quite strangely, which certainly isn't a bad thing, and while your mind is trying to catch up with the band, they sneak up and wallop you with an insane intensity. The growls come from Lemay's mouth like a rabid foam, and when the song finally dies down to a simmer, you know it's just getting ready to boil over again and scorch which, as I'm sure you guessed, it totally does. It's an awesome, relentless finish to a brilliant record.
So, welcome back, Gorguts. What an intense way to remind us you are the masters of this style of death metal and that we all missed you so. “Colored Sands” is an incredible return for the band and one that injects newfound bloodthirst into the death metal genre. This is one of the most formidable, impressive lineups anywhere in metal, and I hope they have more than just this one record in their canon.

It was either the best of premieres or the worst of premieres depending on what numbers and outlets you're looking at. The heavily promoted Season 3 debut of Orphan Black on April 18 drew 535,000 total viewers on BBC America. That's down 13% from those who tuned in for the Season 2 debut on April 19 last year and a drop of 21% from the Season 1 premiere on March 30, 2013. Among adults 18-49 the S3 opener of Tatiana Maslany-led clone thriller snagged 246,000 viewers. Premiere-to-premiere, that's a decline of 37% from the Season 2 debut.
However, unlike the BBC America only airings of Seasons 1 and 2 of Orphan Black, the opener of the 10-episode Season 3 was available on all of AMC Networks channels. To that degree, Saturday's premiere hit an all-time viewership high in Live + Same Day numbers with an audience of 1.27 million tuning in on to simultaneous BBC America, AMC, IFC, SundanceTV and WE tv broadcasts. The synergy was the result of AMC Networks taking operational control over BBC America last October in a $200 million deal.
In Live + 3 numbers, the S3 Orphan Black debut garnered a total of 1.9 million viewers across all five channels. That's a 51% jump over what the Season 2 opener got in the DVR numbers last year from its BBC America broadcast. On BBC America, Live + 3 results saw the premiere's total viewership rise 87% and its 18-49 Live + SD results go up 104% – those are the kind of number a lot of networks would like to replicate. Even more so when the Live + 3 median income of $77,000 makes Orphan Black the second most affluent ad-supported cable drama behind AMC's Mad Men.
Orphan Black is produced by Temple Street Productions in association with BBC America and Bell Media's Space.
Cheese and rice! It's friday again! That means another plan must be made for constructing my wife into a real-life nerd.
Last week, I set up a few goals. Goals, I may add, I considered a little lofty at the time. Not just because I was going to attempt to rope my wife into doing several things she's never done before (or particularly expressed much interest in), but because it was our anniversary weekend. And well, you know… she's a woman and stuff. And a smart man knows an anniversary isn't the best time to start demanding things of his wife. It's her day. You're not supposed to get what you want. Unlessssss you're sneaky and clever and woo her first with fancy things.
It was a bit like that. Except less geriatric.
I guess that's better. But less fat. I'd be allergic to those clothes, too. Whatever.
To recap, last week's sessions were:
Who is Brent Spiner, and Why Should I Care?
You've Enjoyed Watching Me Play Portal, Now How About Listening to the Man Who Wrote the Still Alive Song?
TNG and You: Season One Aboard the Starship Enterprise
Who is That Vision? Oh, That's Felicia Day.
And how did it go, you may be inquiring with your ever-insatiable wrinkly sack of juice and synapses you call a brain? I'll tell you. I won. Everything. That's how the hell it went. Her nerdy apprehension was Billy Madison and I O'Doyled the shit out of her.
We watched not one, but TWO episodes of TNG. Then two episodes of Big Bang Theory (one was the recent episode with Wheaton & Spiner), Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog, and listened the hell out of some Jonathan Coulton.
Shazzzam, son. Or daughter. Depending on your gender. I have no children.
It may have been to my benefit that I was developing a pretty ugly cold last weekend that still hasn't gone away. She took pity on me to some degree – but hey, I'll take it however I can get it. Though it's not like I didn't have to do any work. There was a good bit of explaining things…
“I don't really know why Worf's head looks like that, it's just what Klingons look like.”
“Tasha doesn't make it out of season one. She did have sex with Data though. I won't be showing you that ridiculous episode.”
“Yes, that's the guy from Firefly. Yes, that's the guy we just saw on Big Bang Theory. Yes, she was in the season finales of Dollhouse.”
“There's no reason why you should call a song about Ikea ‘silly.' The man is a genius.”
“Well dear, he was only 14 in the Star Trek episode you watched – how old did you EXPECT him to be now?”
I constructed a graphic to go along with these chronicles. It will be filled in like a donation thermometer as my wife learns more nerdy things. Once she fills up the lenses and becomes a piece of tape on the bridge, she's ready. Not that I've ever actually seen someone with tape on their glasses. Damn me for perpetuating stereotypes.
Last week she was this:
This week, she is this:
Things seem positive for the future. When she came home last night, I was still soaked in sweat and hyperventilating in the corner of our living room after both Wil and Anne Wheaton responded positively to my last post. After she pried me from my soiled underpants and rubbed on some mineral oil, I explained what had happened, and why I had the smell of alcohol and a mixture of pride and fear on my breath. She became really happy for me and gave me stickers and popsicles and said “I'm glad you were able to make such a great connection.” We went to bed shortly after when she asked “hey, did you do another Nerding My Wife yet?”
She's Just That Into Me.

Leo Varadkar tells unionists in Belfast it will be easier to protect union with Britain if UK keeps close relationship with EU
Ireland's prime minister has told unionists in Northern Ireland that it will be easier to protect the union they support with Britain if the UK stays in the European single market.
The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said that rather than pressing the EU for special status for Northern Ireland post-Brexit, it would be better if the entire UK remained inside a customs union with Europe.
Speaking on his first official visit to Belfast on Friday, Varadkar also pointed out that after Brexit everyone in Northern Ireland entitled to an Irish passport would remain an EU citizen.
Unionists have opposed proposals from Sinn Féin and other nationalist parties for special status to be given to Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU. The unionist parties fear that special status could decouple the region from the rest of the UK after Brexit.
Asked about demands for special status for the province, the taoiseach said: “What I would rather see, what I think would be the best outcome, is a very close relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU. We would only need a bespoke solution for Northern Ireland if Britain leaves the single market.
“If the entire United Kingdom stayed in then you don't need special status for Northern Ireland. I hope the unionist parties, for example, who would be keen to protect and preserve the union, would see that it's much easier to do that if the UK stays within the customs union and the single market. Because that would take away the need for any special arrangement or bespoke solution for Northern Ireland.”

Before a meeting with the Democratic Unionist party on Friday afternoon, Varadkar said Brexit had the potential to “drive a wedge” between Britain and Ireland.
The taoiseach told a press conference at Queen's University Belfast that he was a realist about Brexit happening and was not operating on the basis that it was not going to come about or that there would be a second EU referendum in the UK.
Earlier during a speech at the university, he suggested the UK could enter into a “deep” free trade agreement with the EU when Britain leaves Europe.
He said: “For example if the United Kingdom does not want to stay in the customs union, perhaps there can be a EU-UK customs union. After all, we have one with Turkey. Surely we can have one with the United Kingdom?
“If the UK does not want to stay in the single market, perhaps it could enter into a deep free trade agreement with the EU and rejoin Efta [the European Free Trade Association] which it was a member prior to accession. And if this cannot be agreed now, then perhaps we have a transition period during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union while things are worked out,” Varadkar said.
He said no one on the island wanted to return to the days of a militarised, heavily policed border. “The border itself was a very different place, a place of bloodshed and violence, of checkpoints. A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace. A brutal physical manifestation of historic divisions and political failure,” he said.
Varadkar vowed that in Brexit negotiations he would seek to protect the benefits of the peace process for all the island's people.
He ruled out a proposal from one of his Fine Gael party colleagues this week that a border could be redrawn in the Irish Sea rather than on the island itself. Varadkar said it was not his policy in relation to dealing with Northern Ireland. That proposal enraged unionists who saw it as a move to redraw the 1921 partition settlement on the island of Ireland.
On devolution and power sharing being restored in Northern Ireland, he said: “We need the executive, the assembly, the North South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council up and running and acting in the interests of our peoples. We need that more than ever, and we need it now.”
After meeting the five main political parties represented in the Stormont assembly on Friday, the taoiseach will stay overnight in Belfast. He will then attend a breakfast on Saturday morning with gay rights campaigners ahead of the annual Pride demonstration in Belfast.
Varadkar again voiced his support for marriage equality in Northern Ireland. The region is the only part of the UK and Ireland where gay couples cannot legally marry, principally due to the opposition of the DUP in the Stormont assembly.
Εliminate response times using Celery for asynchronous task queue in a Django web application.
The concept
A user connects to our application, submitting a form with data. The application must process user' s data generating a result. Then must use the result to call another external application that will do another task.
In a classic approach, these time consumming operations would force the user to wait (and the application server's process to be busy) until the external application eventualy respond. This is not always the desired behavior.
We may want, after the initial user interaction, pass the upcoming tasks to a task queue for asyncronous execusion and free the user immediately.
Celery
Celery can implement asynchronous python task queues. You can create a task and use Celery for passing it to a queue and leave the queue to manage it then. Celery needs a message transport like RabbitMQ and Redis in order to send and receive messages. Check here for RabbitMQ and here for Redis installation guides and integration with Celery.
Choose Redis if you need speed or RabbitMQ if you need persistence for your message data. Both of them are feature complete and production ready.
We are assuming that Redis is already installed and active for our demonstration:
username@hostname:~$ redis-cli ping
PONG
Real-world example
We will create a Django application that is displaying a form. A user enters name, e-mail address, and a text message and clicks a submit button. Then the application creates an e-mail message with a subject and a body and uses our application's gmail account to send a mail to the user thanking him for his message and another mail to us informing for users's message.
For the gmail api call we will use the python program described in a previous article:
Sending e-mails using gmail API
Celery installation
We assume that you already have a python virtual environment in the directory ~/virtual_env with a basic django application named "django_basic_app" inside a project named "django_project".
Activate your environment:
username@hostname:~$ source ~/virtual_env/bin/activate
Install Celery with Redis dependencies (inside your virtualenv):
(virtual_env) username@hostname:~$ pip install celery[redis]
Add the following Celery-related settings in your basic django application settings.py file:
# CELERY SETTINGS
BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['json']
CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'Europe/Athens' # Replace with your timezone
Create a file named "celery.py" in your basic django application:
~/django_project/django_basic_app/celery.py
from __future__ import absolute_import import os from celery import Celery # set the default Django settings module for the 'celery' program. os . environ . setdefault ( 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' , 'django_basic_app.settings' ) from django.conf import settings # noqa app = Celery ( 'django_basic_app' ) # Using a string here means the worker will not have to # pickle the object when using Windows. app . config_from_object ( 'django.conf:settings' ) app . autodiscover_tasks ( lambda : settings . INSTALLED_APPS ) @app . task ( bind = True ) def debug_task ( self ): print ( 'Request: {0!r}' . format ( self . request ))
Now create this file:
~/django_project/django_basic_app/__init__.py
from __future__ import absolute_import # This will make sure the app is always imported when # Django starts so that shared_task will use this app. from .celery import app as celery_app # noqa
After that we are ready to create a new application named "feedback" that meets our specifications.
New django application
(virtual_env) username@hostname:~$ cd django_project
(virtual_env) username@hostname:~$ python manage.py startapp feedback
Add the application in your settings.py file:
INSTALLED_APPS = (
# ...
'feedback',
)
Copy the python program we created in in the "feedback" application (gmailTest.py). We will use it as a library in our task so comment out the part with ArgumentParser:
try:
import argparse
flags = argparse.ArgumentParser(parents=[tools.argparser]).parse_args()
except ImportError:
flags = None
Now we can create the asyncronous task. Create the following file:
~/django_project/feedback/tasks.py
from celery.decorators import task from celery.utils.log import get_task_logger from feedback.gmailTest import create_message , get_credentials , SendMessage import httplib2 import os from apiclient import discovery import oauth2client from oauth2client import client from oauth2client import tools import time import base64 from email.mime.text import MIMEText from apiclient import errors logger = get_task_logger ( __name__ ) @task ( name = "call_gmail_api" ) def auth_and_send ( sender , recepient , subject , text_body ): credentials = get_credentials () http = credentials . authorize ( httplib2 . Http ()) service = discovery . build ( 'gmail' , 'v1' , http = http ) testMessage = create_message ( sender , recepient , subject , text_body ) time . sleep ( 100 ) SendMessage ( service , sender , testMessage )
Note the time.sleep() function that we use to demonstrate that task is running asyncronously.
Create the form:
~/django_project/feedback/forms.py
from django import forms from message.tasks import auth_and_send class FeedbackForm ( forms . Form ): name = forms . CharField ( label = 'Full name*' , max_length = 100 , required = True ) email = forms . EmailField ( label = "email*" , required = True ) message = forms . CharField ( label = "Message*" , widget = forms . Textarea ( attrs = { 'rows' : 3 })) def send_email ( self ): body = ( 'Name: ' + self . cleaned_data [ 'name' ] + '\r
' + \ 'e-mail: ' + self . cleaned_data [ 'email' ] + '\r
' + 'Message: ' + self . cleaned_data [ 'message' ]) auth_and_send . delay ( 'app_account@gmail.com' , self . cleaned_data [ 'email' ], 'Company thanks for your message' , body ) auth_and_send . delay ( 'app_account@gmail.com' , 'app_account@gmail.com' , 'Message from Company' , body )
The key point here is that we just added a .delay() function to our code without any other change in order to implement the asyncronous execution.
Create the view:
~/django_project/feedback/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render from django.views.generic.edit import FormView from message.forms import FeedbackForm class FeedbackView ( FormView ): template_name = 'feedback.html' form_class = FeedbackForm success_url = '.' def form_valid ( self , form ): form . send_email () return super ( FeedbackView , self ) . form_valid ( form )
...the template you point in your view:
~/django_project/feedback/templates/feedback.html
<div class= "row" > <div class= "col s12" > <h3> Feedback </h3> <form action= "" method= "post" > { % csrf_token % } {{ form.as_p } } <button class= "btn waves-effect waves-light" type= "submit" name= "action" > Submit <i class= "mdi-content-send right" ></i> </button> </form> </div> </div>
...and expose the view in your urls.py:
~/django_project/django_basic_app/urls.py
from django.conf.urls import url from feedback.views import FeedbackView urlpatterns = [ url ( r'^feedback/$' , FeedbackView . as_view (), name = 'feedback' ), # ... ]
Now hit your application at https://www.company.com/feedback/
Before you submit the form, dont forget to start the celery worker with this command:
(virtual_env) username@hostname:~$ celery worker -A django_basic_app --loglevel=INFO

The State Of Men's Marathoning In The U.S. Ryan Wood / August 13, 2014
The 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon will be an intriguing affair. Photo: PhotoRun.net
Which three runners will drape themselves in the American flag at the finish line of the 2016 Trials? At this point, it's impossible to guess.
So, are you an optimist or a pessimist?
Do you look at the state of elite-level men's marathoning in the U.S. and get excited? Or is the view depressing?
Today we're exactly 18 months away from the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon races in Los Angeles. Three Olympic team slots are up for grabs and you could argue there isn't a single runner in the driver's seat at this point to grab one.
Is that thrilling or terrifying? Because there are two ways to look at it, depending on how full (or empty) your glass is:
— The field is wide open, and that's great. While the well-known veterans—Meb Keflezighi, Ryan Hall, Dathan Ritzenhein, Abdi Abdirahman—are still forces to be reckoned with, there are so many marathoners in the 2:10-2:12 range today that the trials are going to have unmatched intrigue. Plus, the recent retirement announcements from Jason Hartman and Andrew Carlson could open up a chance for other up-and-coming runners. There are no less than a dozen runners with a legitimate chance at contending for one of those three slots.
— On the flip side, one could make the argument that American competitiveness will end there. Everyone in the field has flaws: Keflezighi, 39, and Abdirahman, 37, aren't getting any younger, Ritzenhein, 31, continues to struggle with injuries and Hall isn't the runner he was even two years ago. Not to mention the fact that no other current American runner, so far, has broken 2:10. The warts are real, and there may be enough of them to prevent anyone in the U.S. from being consistently competitive on the world's stage in the next few years.
RELATED: Who will make the 2016 U.S. Olympic Marathon teams?
The mystery of the 2016 trials should be fun to watch play out, but some say the bigger picture isn't a rosy one.
“We're just not that good in the marathon,” says Greg McMillan, a running coach who trained pros through adidas-sponsored McMillan Elite team for several years. “When you look at the list, we only have nine U.S. citizens that have broken 2:10 on non-aided courses [four who are currently running], and only six more on aided courses like Boston. That's pretty bad. In other countries, they'll have that many (break 2:10) in a weekend.”
Why can't the U.S. be more competitive? We live in a sports-crazed country of 300 million people. It has the technology and the resources for cutting-edge training like the Nike Oregon Project. It has the geography for altitude training. And the latest running boom over the last 10 years has drawn more interest to the sport than ever before, both at the entry level and at the competitive level.
Yet when Ryan Hall leaned across the finish line at the 2008 London Marathon in 2:06:17, it represented a high-water mark of sorts (Keflezighi's major victories aside). No American has come within 90 seconds of Hall's performance that day on an unaided course—not even Hall himself. And really, nobody seems poised to anytime soon.
To take it one step further, as of Aug. 13, there are 60 runners from around the world who have run faster this year than Meb Keflezighi's Boston Marathon-winning time of 2:08:37. Not only are there no Americans among the top 60, but Hall, Ritzenhein and Khalid Khannouchi are the only U.S. runners to have ever run that fast.
So while the trials will be a must-see event and will serve as a quadrennial benchmark of American distance running, the drama could very well end there. And everybody has a theory as to why U.S. runners struggle to stack up alongside other countries in the marathon.

Starting Young
Lifting the flag of Uganda over his head with a huge grin stretching across his face, Stephen Kiprotich crossed the finish line of the 2012 Olympic marathon in a winning time of 2:08:01.
Kiprotich was 23 years old that day. It was his fourth marathon.
Such experience at such a young age is nearly unheard of in the U.S. Heck, many 23-year-olds in the U.S. are still running college track. Even Hall, who started running the distance earlier than most Americans, made his marathon debut at the age of 24.
While Keflezighi has shown that a marathoner can be successful well into his 30s, many think the younger years are where the foundation is most effectively set.
“The Ethiopians and the Kenyans, these are guys who are running marathons young. They're running marathons at 21, 22, 23,” says Pete Rea, who coaches a team of elite athletes at Reebok-sponsored ZAP Fitness. “They're honing it, they're mastering it, they're learning the subtleties associated with the marathon.”
Many elite American runners, though, take a slower path. They finish college at 22 or 23, head straight to track, and, depending on their rate of success, move to road races and marathons sometime after that.
“A lot of the African athletes are jumping into the marathon at 19, 20 years old,” says Sam Grotewold, manager of professional athletes for the New York Road Runners. “But in the U.S., people tend to wait longer. That's the way it's always gone.”
The Cost of Progression
Ryan Vail is encouraged by his marathon career so far. Save his 2:13 finish at the 2013 New York City Marathon, he's been able to progress at each of his races—a 2:12 at the Olympic Trials in 2012, a 2:11 at the Fukuoka Marathon later that year, and a 2:10 at the London Marathon this past April.
“I still feel like I have a few minutes to go,” says Vail, 28, who lives in Portland, Ore. “It's one step at a time. I'm now a 2:10 guy, so I'm going to start looking at 2:09. When you hit 2:09, you can start talking about 2:08.”
Vail readily admits he doesn't have the natural talent of a fast track guy like Ritzenhein, who's marathon PR is 2:07:47, so a slow and steady progression like this is his ticket.
“Is 2:07 out of reach?” Vail says. “I hope not. But it's going to take time to get there.”
It's time that some runners can't afford to take—literally.
Jeffrey Eggleston, who lowered his PR to 2:10:52 at the Gold Coast Marathon in Australia this summer, compares professional marathon running to any other career where you have to work your way up—and struggle financially at first.
“You have to pay your dues, and you need to invest in yourself,” says Eggleston, 29, who trains in Boulder, Colo.. “You have to build up your running resume and go to different races and make an investment in yourself to keep running at a high level.”
But dropping from, say, a 2:15 personal best to a 2:10 or even lower (which means more money) can be a long process, and the results certainly aren't guaranteed. Meanwhile, many of these runners have degrees from well-known universities. Starting a career in the real world can be an enticing option for them, and their potential in the marathon could go unrealized as a result.
“The economics for us are very tough,” McMillan says. “Most distance runners have good college degrees and can get good jobs. In other countries, running is the way out. [Running] is the good job.”
He adds: “We lose them all the time. Everyone who ran in college knows of athletes who could've developed into really good runners. But they got jobs.”
The Battle With Track
Galen Rupp has become the darling of American distance running, winning silver in the 10,000 meters at the London Olympics and breaking his own American record in the event earlier this year at the Prefontaine Classic. His talent has marathon fans drooling. A 1:00:30 half marathon in 2011 was another clue at Rupp's potential brilliance at longer distances.
But if we want to see what Rupp, 28, is capable of doing in the marathon, we're going to have to wait. His coach, Alberto Salazar, has said it will be after the 2016 Olympics before Rupp even considers making the jump. Rupp will be 30 years old in two years when the Games hit Rio.
Oftentimes, the top few 5,000- and 10,000-meter runners make a good living on the track during their prime speed years, while the next tier find better potential earnings in the marathon and shorter road races. Depth among American distance runners matters. The marathon suffers more than other events when there's not enough of it.
“If you're an American who's a 13:35 5Ker, you can make a living and still stick with the shorter races,” Rea says. “In Kenya, (with that time) you run road races and you run marathons.”
Rupp has run a 12:58 in the 5,000 meters, and his Olymic medal cemented his rockstar status—likely a well-compensated one with his sponsorship backing from Nike. While marathon fans certainly want to see Rupp take on the distance (his training partner, Mo Farah of Great Britain, ran a 2:08 in his marathon debut at London this past April), many close to the sport understand why Rupp is staying on the track for now.
“He has a silver medal and the American record. I'm sure he's well-compensated. He can do whatever he wants,” McMillan says. “The major marathons would pay him six figures, maybe even seven figures with a multi-year deal. It's not financial with him. It's strategy.”
Grotewold figures the marathon will eventually lure in most of America's top track stars. He looks at runners like Rupp, Chris Derrick and Ben True and sees America's future in the event—even though they haven't attempted it yet. Derrick, a two-time U.S. cross-country champion, is 23, while True, sixth at the world cross country championships in 2013, is 28.
“For all of them, it's coming,” Grotewold says. “Maybe not by 2016, but it's coming. Someone among that group will be a 2:06, 2:07 guy.”
Training Philosophies
The simplified stereotype of U.S. marathon training is its prioritization of volume over intensity. Vail thinks there's some truth to it.
“There are so many runners doing different things, so it's hard to speak for everybody,” Vail says. “But I feel like there's an overemphasis on saying ‘I run this many miles in a week.' Yeah, but how many are you doing hard?' I think there's got to be a balance between those.
“U.S. distance runners are still trying to find that balance.”
Coaches like Rea and McMillan think the Americans are close to nailing it down, with several coaches beginning to do the high-intensity workouts like 30K runs at marathon pace that international runners are already doing.
The difference, McMillan says, is the gains made with those intense workouts are not created equal.
“The problem is the preparation for becoming a runner at the age of 20,” McMillan says. “In some countries, the athletes have 15 years of basic foundational training under their belts just as part of their lifestyle.
“You have a greater aerobic base behind it. If you add intensity on top of it, obviously that athlete is going to have huge improvements. So Americans are behind the 8-ball, but not because the training philosophy doesn't match what the best runners in the world are doing. It's because the best runners have a different background.”
Is the Bar Too Low?
Tsegaye Mekonnen, an 18-year-old Ethiopian, won the Dubai Marathon in 2:04:32 earlier this year, pulling away from fellow countrymen Markos Geneti at the 22-mile mark.
It was a remarkable debut, but not just because of that 2:04 time or even the fact that he's still a teenager. Rather, Mekonnen stayed with the lead pack to run the first half of Dubai in 1:01:27. Before that race, his PR in the half marathon was 1:02:53.
That is a courageous, go-for-it attitude that Eggleston said Americans don't show enough of—perhaps to their detriment.
“They don't think about it. They go for it. They're willing to lay it on the line,” Eggleston says of East Africans like Mekonnen. “Americans are way more conservative. I don't want to criticize us for that because maybe we're being smart and running within ourselves. But we never really take a huge risk and stick our neck out.”
Are low expectations holding Americans back? It seems trivial compared to the other, more tangible reasons. But multiple people interviewed for this story cited it as a possible factor.
“2:10 is a very, very good marathon. Exceptional. But at international races, it's not competitive anymore,” Rea says. “We need to start thinking more along the lines of 2:07, 2:08 as something feasible.”
Eggleston agrees.
“If we want to run 2:08, we should shoot for 2:08,” he says. “I think athletes are trying to get their feet wet in the marathon and are shooting for more modest starting points. If you want to be world class, you've got to go for it.”
The Future
The pessimists have plenty of evidence, but optimism will always have its place. While the men's marathon in the U.S. has a lot of question marks heading into 2016 and beyond, there are runners capable of quieting the skeptics.
Keflezighi, Hall and Ritzenhein are all dangerous, experienced runners despite their question marks. Kelfezighi, despite his age and relatively modest personal best of 2:08:37 set in winning this year's Boston Marathon, has shown that he can still mix it up in a championship-style race. Eggleston, Vail and Brett Gotcher are 2:10 guys who are still in their 20s, and still improving. There are several more 2:11 guys in the mix—Nick Arciniaga, Fernando Cabada and Andrew Carlson, to name a few.
In addition, several track stars are starting to trickle up to the marathon as well. Rupp is a possibility after 2016 and has the talent to make an immediate impact. Matt Tegenkamp, one of a few American track athletes to break 13 minutes in the 5,000, debuted with a 2:12 at last fall's Chicago Marathon and told FloTrack afterwards, “I think I can make big strides in this event.” But Tegenkamp is already 32.
The pessimists have a point (many points, actually), but the optimists have a few, too. The next 18 months will see runners strategically choosing races with a build-up to the Olympic Trials in mind. Then, on Feb. 13, 2016 they will battle it out on the streets of Los Angeles.
Which three runners will drape themselves in the American flag at the finish line? At this point, it's impossible to guess. Whether that's good or bad, it's certainly intriguing.
“Could Ryan Hall make another team? Sure. Could Dathan make another team? He could. Meb? Absolutely,” Rea says. “But there are a cadre of young guns waiting in the wings and training hard and one of them could break through—people like Jeff Eggleston and Christo Landry and Tyler Pennel and Craig Leon. I think you're going to see a couple of guys do some amazing things in 2016 and 2020 and hopefully we start thinking differently about what's good on an international level.”
Well that didn't take long.
Like an imprudent Imperial officer questioning Darth Vader's confidence in the Force, Cardinal Robert Sarah dared to address a central tenet of the erroneous Spirit of Vatican 2, and for his “lack of faith” in a post-conciliar liturgical innovation, he has been promptly given the Vader treatment…and in the Year of Mercy no less!
What was the great offense committed by this humble and soft spoken prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments? What was said to actually prompt a clarification from the Vatican?…yes, you read that correctly…an actual, honest to goodness, clarification from Rome!
Cardinal Sarah had the audacity, the absolute temerity, to suggest that his brother bishops consider returning to ad orientem Masses beginning this Advent. At their discretion. Only following proper catechesis. And in continuity with the liturgical tradition of the Catholic Church, east and west, for 1,900 years.
It wasn't as if the Cardinal advocated giving holy communion to those living in adulterous relationships, where a valid sacramental marriage ended in divorce (no annulment) and yet a second, civil, marriage has been entered into.
It's not like Cardinal Sarah authored an intentionally ambiguous exhortation which has resulted in entire bishops conferences offering conflicting interpretations of a magisterial document…when charity and justice would seem to demand an immediate clarification from Holy Mother Church.
No, all Cardinal Sarah did was suggest that all of us, priest and faithful together, turn toward the Lord, ad orientem, in those appropriate moments of the liturgy.
So, in the spirit of another Catholic blogger, here are ten things to know and share about Cardinal Sarah having his liturgical legs cut out from underneath him:
1. He gave his address a week ago at Sacra Liturgia UK.
2. The Catholic internet blew up over his suggestion for masses to be offered ad orientem beginning the First Sunday of Advent.
3. Aging hippies, Jesuits, and modernists (often one and the same) and readers of sites such as Pray Tell flipped out at the very thought that the Mass isn't about them after all.
4. Cardinal Sarah met with Cardinal Vincent Nichols of Westminster, who proceeded to pull a Brutus to Sarah's Caesar. Nichols promptly had a letter out to his priests advising them that they would most certainly not be turning eastward this Advent, as he apparently believes that worship of God cannot be sustained unless priest and faithful stare at each other unceasingly at Mass.
5. Cardinal Sarah returned to Rome on Saturday and, reportedly, was summoned to meet with the pope. One can only guess how this went. We can hope it was an opportunity for accompaniment…as opposed to some kind of sensitivity training…mandated (no doubt) for those still clinging to that whole “reform of the reform” business Benedict was so fond of.
6. By Monday, July 11, two more Jesuits had their crack at Sarah. First, Fr. Antonio Spadaro, papal adviser and editor of the influential Jesuit journal La Civiltà Cattolica, tweeted a series of excerpts from the GIRM (General Instruction of the Roman Missal), apparently seeking to discredit Cardinal Sarah. It didn't. Then, outgoing Vatican spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi S.J. also misinterpreted the GIRM in a communique released on Monday, arguing incorrectly (like Cardinal Nichols) that a recommendation for a free standing altar in #299 means that versus populum is the liturgical norm for the Ordinary Form. This tired and erroneous reading has been refuted before.
7. By Monday afternoon America Magazine, Rocco Palma, and their readers were celebrating the public “schooling” given to a celebrated voice for orthodoxy.
I don't really have an 8, 9, or 10. Besides, why does a “ten things to know and share” list actually need to have ten things? That just strikes me as rigid legalism.
What happens next? Who knows. Will Cardinal Sarah end up on a metaphorical Malta; banished to the Trad gulag for failure to embrace liturgical rupture over continuity? We pray that is not the case.
What has been made very clear (again) for anyone still in denial about it is this: the Spirit of Vatican 2 is alive and well. The reform of the reform, so much a part of the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, is simply as optional as the Ordinary Form of the Mass is itself option filled.
Go back and read the top 5 Quotes from Cardinal Sarah's address. There is nothing in his talk that is earth shattering, revolutionary, or inconsistent with the tradition of the Roman Rite. That he and his suggestion caused such a reaction only speaks to how severe the rupture truly is.
Lord have mercy.

Persianfootball.com – KUALA LUMPUR, Four years ago Iran suffered heartbreak when a 1-1 on the final matchday in Seoul was not enough to even advance to the World Cup qualifying playoffs.
Undoubtedly Team Melli had already failed to deliver earlier, but what made the occassion special was that the final two matches of the Asian World Cup qualifying groups were not played simultaneously.
Contenders Saudi Arabia and North Korea faced each other in Riyadh hours after the final whistle in South Korea, knowing a draw would now be enough to see both sides through instead of Iran.
Unsurprisingly, the two sides were eager not to concede and a lackluster goalless draw was the result.
Why the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) failed to schedule the matches fairly almost 30 years after the “Disgrace of Gijon” had changed the football world to the better and, if not able to do so, why the lower seeded teams got the advantage of playing last, is only a mystery to those who have not followed Asian football closely.
History repeating?
However, this time FIFA reacted and ruled all final group matches, even in the qualifiers, must be kicked off simultaneously.
Chapter 18, point 10 of the official FIFA World Cup 2014 regulations clearly states that “the FIFA Organising Committee shall ensure that matches in the same group are played simultaneously when the situation demands this for sporting reasons.”
The first team to benefit from that again were the Saudis when their match in Australia in the second round of qualifiers was kicked off simultaneously to Oman's game against Thailand. Yet, the Saudis gave away a 1-0 lead to eventually lose 1-3 and bowed out of the competition early as Oman trounced Thailand at home.
One would assume AFC to schedule the final games of the third and last qualifying round on June 18 – Iran's clash in South Korea again as well as Qatar's match in Uzbekistan – simultaneously this time.
But the AFC's official homepage lists Iran's game in Ulsan at 20:00 local time, exactly two hours before the game in Tashkent will kick off at 18:00 local time.
The Iranian Football Federation (IFF) already sent a “reminder” to the AFC to do their job properly this time, but doubts arise within Iran if the AFC will fully comply with the rules, especially if patronaged Qatar should still be in contention then.
Should that be the case, Iran again could be betrayed from a fair chance of qualification for the second time in a row.
An almost 90-minute incursion over the Border by a British RAF pilot, who flew as far south as Mullingar, prompted a diplomatic incident and major embarrassment on the part of the British authorities.
The pilot, who had just arrived in Northern Ireland a week before, spent almost an hour and a half patrolling the skies over Meath and Louth in a British Beaver aircraft, of the kind used by the army for photo-reconnaissance missions during the Troubles.
At one point during the early morning flight on December 30th, 1987, the aircraft came within just 23 miles of Dublin airport.
A cable from Irish officials in Belfast to Dublin the following day said the British admitted the incursion and were “greatly embarrassed by it”.
The pilot had been tasked to do a particular job for surveillance purposes.
“The British side say that the pilot in question thought that border clearance meant that he could fly over the Border. I was told that the man in question ‘honestly thought he had permission to fly anywhere in the Republic'.”
He had now been “firmly disabused of this notion”, the note added.
“It is, in fact, admitted that he flew as far as Mullingar where he turned back, arriving at Aldergrove at about 8am. The British say that an incursion of 40 miles was involved.”
Embarrassment The Belfast officials said the embarrassment to the British was such that the most senior commanding officer had taken a direct role in establishing what had happened.
They told the British they would “convey their regret and embarrassment to my authorities” and said they had already questioned the nature of briefings, if any, given to such pilots “before they come to this part of the world”.
“In general terms I expressed incredulity that any British army pilot could possibly think he was free to fly at will in our airspace.”
The British side repeated their embarrassment at the whole affair and said the pilot had been spoken to “in very strong terms”.
A note in National Archives files from Department of Foreign Affairs secretary general Noel Dorr to senior government officials on January 21st said he had called in the British chargé d'affaires over the matter.
Other cross-Border incursions revealed in the archives include one by a marine boat attached to the gun boat in Carlingford Lough, which did a circle around Greenore Port on July 15th with someone on board waving a Union Jack.
It's the home of one of Ottawa's best concert halls, drawing nearly 1,000 people to performances during Chamberfest, the Jazz Festival and other big cultural events.
It's a beautiful century-old Romanesque Revival building with parkland and parking that occupies more than half a city block at a prime downtown location.
And it could soon give Carleton University a new connection to the heart of the city.
At its Dec. 5 meeting, Carleton's Board of Governors approved a motion to formally negotiate the potential purchase of the historic Dominion-Chalmers United Church — east of O'Connor Street between Lisgar and Cooper — for use as a multi-purpose performance space for students and faculty, and a hub for artists and community groups.
“The acquisition of this unique community asset would provide valuable performance space for Carleton students and faculty that isn't available on the main campus,” said Carleton President Alastair Summerlee.
“By creating this downtown hub, we are renewing an important link with the Ottawa community that had the bold vision to create Carleton in 1942.”
The board's decision follows a due diligence process completed by the university earlier this year. The recommendation to proceed on acquiring the property is subject to the negotiation of a satisfactory purchase and sales agreement, including appropriate legal caveats.
Teenage attacker Martin Odegaard has confirmed he has signed a new deal with LaLiga champions Real Madrid.
Odegaard was thrust into the spotlight when he moved to Madrid as a 16-year-old in January 2015, but he has since made just one league appearance for Zinedine Zidane's side.
However, the Champions League winners appear to have kept faith in the Norwegian's talent by handing him an extension beyond the end of the season.
The new deal reportedly ties Odegaard to Madrid until the end of the 2020-21 campaign, although the nine-time international was hesitant to reveal the length of the contract.
"A little more than 2018 at least," he told Norwegian publication VG Sporten of the extension.
"I do not want to say much more at the moment."
Odegaard is currently into the second season of an 18-month loan stint at Eredivisie side Heerenveen, where he has started all three matches this term.

Speaking in June, the 18-year-old reiterated his belief in breaking through at Madrid.
"They come to watch my games and follow me closely," he told Norwegian television channel TV 2.
"They said that they would be monitoring how I am getting along and say that they still want to invest in me."

During the nighttime raid of Zuccotti Park, the NYPD, with the help of the Department of Sanitation, confiscated the items that the Occupy Wall Street protesters had used to make the area home. Demonstrators were told that they could pick up their property, which was just moved so the NYPD could do some mopping, at a Sanitation building on West 57th street. However, there was no mention of what condition the items would be in, and Motherboard reports that computers taken in the raid were broken and dented, appearing to have been "smashed with bats."
A reporter followed Isaac Wilder, a member of OWS' Signal Corps, which was charged with providing Wi-Fi in Zuccotti, as he entered the Sanitation building to collect his property taken in the raid: a backpack, a nine-foot tall tower containing wireless routers, and $5,000 in cash. No press are allowed in the building, and Wilder describes the mound of personal affects as "a large heap of damp, mangled, cat-piss smelling stuff." He finds all the broken computers, laid out in a row.
A Sanitation rep tells Motherboard that he's "not surprised" that the laptops are damaged, and neither are we considering that witnesses to the raid described the "crunching" sound of the contents of Zuccotti Park being dumped into truck beds. Wilder didn't end up finding any of his property; it appears to be lost along with the items from the library, medical tent, and other portions of the park that accrued two months worth of resources.
But don't worry: if the protesters feel that their property was "mishandled or misplaced" you can always fill out a form. Plus, the park's floor is clean enough to eat off it (if you're a pigeon). It's all part of the NYPD's new cleaning service. You won't even notice they're working. We've contacted the NYPD and the Sanitation Department for comment.
Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during a town hall meeting at Trinity Episcopal Church while campaigning in Charlottesville, Virginia May 11, 2015. REUTERS/Jay Paul
Bernie Sanders is challenging a longstanding tradition in American politics, that major-party presidential candidates must all push for faster economic growth. In a sense, he's inverting tradition -- saying that the nation should worry first about changing the economy to direct more of its spoils to workers and less to the wealthiest Americans. I recently interviewed Sanders at length about inequality; the conversation is edited for length.
Jim Tankersley: You've been talking about inequality for a long time. Why is it resonating as a national issue now?
Bernie Sanders: The American people understand that it is grotesquely unfair – we are a society that prides itself on fairness, that prides itself on equal opportunity, and people are looking out and seeing, since the Great Recession of 2008, 99 percent of all new income going to the top 1 percent. So you're seeing people working in my state, all over this country, two jobs, they're working three jobs, and they're getting nowhere in a hurry. They're working hard. They can't afford to send their kids to college in many instances. They can't afford child care for their little babies. They're worried to death about retirement.
And meanwhile, they see incredible wealth disparities such that the top one tenth of one percent owns almost as much as the bottom 90 percent.
The basic issue of an American society which is fair, which is providing opportunity for all, is now being replaced by the correct perception that we're living in a rigged economy - where it doesn't matter how hard you worked, the result will be all the income goes to the people at the very top. It's leading to a lot of frustration and anger, and people want some fundamental changes to the way we do economics and growth.
Tankersley: In every presidential campaign I can remember, candidates have talked about how we need more growth. Do you think we need more growth?
Sanders: That's another issue. When we look at climate change and other environmental issues, growth for the sake of growth – especially when 99 percent of all new income generated by that growth goes to the top 1 percent – becomes less significant. What we need to do is create economic policies that benefit the middle class and the working families in this country. And right now that's not happening. So, yeah, we need economic growth, but we need growth that works well for everybody, not just the people at the top.
Tankersley: How do we achieve that kind of growth?
Sanders: Let me bore you for a minute with some facts.
Tankersley: You can't bore me – I'm an econ reporter.
(Laughter) If the bottom 90 percent – that is a very broad definition of the middle class – had simply maintained the same share of wealth that it did in 1985, that bottom 90 percent would own $10.7 trillion more in wealth than it does today. Meanwhile, from that same period, the top one tenth of one percent has seen its wealth increase by about $8 trillion.
So we have to very straightforwardly and unashamedly address this wealth inequality. We have come up with some tax proposals already, which begins that process – a transaction tax on Wall Street, a program that would end the ability of corporations to stash their money in the Cayman Islands. We're working on a comprehensive bill right now on individual tax rates, which obviously in my view have got to go up.
When we are seeing a massive redistribution of wealth since 1985 from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent, our economic goals have got to be to redistribute that wealth back to the people who had it. How do you do that? You start, you have to create decent-paying jobs. I have introduced legislation that would spend about $1 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. That would create about 13 million new jobs and maintain some jobs. Clearly, we've got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, which would be $15 an hour. We need to pay equity for women.
We've got to do what every other major country on earth does and have a medical and family leave program. We have got to have sick leave for workers. We have got to do what every other industrialized nation does and that is guarantee at least 10 days of paid vacation. We've got to change our trade policies, so countries aren't shutting down here and moving abroad.
Tankersley: Do you worry that if all you do is redistribute, you don't fix the market mechanisms that cause inequality in the first place?
Sanders: If you have a tax system that's fairer than you already have, and you have a mechanism, as I have proposed, to make tuition free in colleges and universities, I think you are dealing with changing the infrastructure of the inequality that's going on now.
Tankersley: Are you willing to accept some decline in efficiency in the labor market, by enacting more regulation?
Sanders: By efficiency, many conservative economists mean, ‘the best way for large corporations to make excessive profits.' So if efficiency means that they shut down the Washington Post today and move it to China, because people there are willing to work for lower wages, that's efficient, isn't it? Ok. Those are quote-unquote efficiencies. They're efficient for the people who own the corporations. They're not particularly efficient for the people who have been thrown out on the street. So if you're talking about maximizing corporate profits, that's not what I think the economy should be about.
Tankersley: If we are in a ‘rigged' economy, how did we get here?
Sanders: For the last 40 years, there has been a massive attack by the wealthiest people in this country, by the Koch brothers, by corporate America, against the middle class. And the result of that has been they have seen a huge transfer of wealth that has gone from the middle class to the top one tenth of one percent.
Tankersley: We've seen inequality widen in the wake of the Great Recession. What has gone wrong in the Obama years?
Sanders: In many respects, the president was not strong enough on many issues. For example, he's wrong on the trade issue, dead wrong. Also, the president made a mistake, that after his brilliant campaign of 2008, he essentially said to his most motivated supporters, thanks very much for electing me, but I'll go from here on my own. I'll sit down and negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell and I really don't need you anymore. Terrible mistake. Because the only way forward, to bring forth a progressive agenda, is to have the American people mobilized.
Jim Tankersley: Let's go back to growth and the environment. Are you worried we're at a moment like Naomi Klein describes, where industrialized economies need to stop growing in order to avoid the worst of climate change?
Sanders: Yes. I am. The point is, there's growth and there's growth, but unchecked growth – especially when 99 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent – is absurd. Where we've got to move is not growth for the sake of growth, but we've got to move to a society that provides a high quality of life for all of our people. In other words, if people have health care as a right, as do the people of every other major country, then there's less worry about growth. If people have educational opportunity and their kids can go to college and they have child care, then there's less worry about growth for the sake of growth.
Do you think we can decarbonize the economy and keep growing people's incomes?
Sanders: Yes. Yes I do.
Despite diplomatic wrangling by South Korea, the Meiji-era industrial sites in Japan have been awarded UNESCO World Heritage status, announced Sunday (05.07.2015) during the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee in the German city of Bonn. The move marks a historic step in relations between Japan and South Korea, with Japan acknowledging for the first time that it forced South Koreans into harsh working conditions during World War II.
The 23 inscribed sites on 11 different locations include steelworks, shipbuilding yards and a coal mine on the island of Hashima (pictured), and are all considered invaluable representations of Japan's own industrial revolution - testimony to the first non-Western industrialization.
However, as always there are at least two sides to history. While there was jubilation in Tokyo, the response in Seoul was notably less celebratory. For many South Koreans these industrial sites serve as brutal reminders of Japanese imperialism and forced labor.
Disputed legacy
South Koreans demonstrated against the UNESCO inscription prior to the official meeting in Bonn
After annexing the Korean peninsula in 1910, the Japanese exploited many of the region's citizens until Japan's eventual defeat in 1945, following World War II. Tens of thousands of forced laborers were sent to toil in these industrial sites, including many owned by business giant Mitsubishi.
Ahead of the decision, South Korea urged the World Heritage Committee not to approve the site, arguing that official heritage inscription would "violate the dignity of the survivors." However, in a statement issued Sunday, the country expressed its approval, adding that the decision "marks another important step toward remembering the pain and suffering of the victims, healing the painful wounds of history, and reaffirming that the historical truth of the unfortunate past should also be reflected in an objective manner."
Japan tried to minimize already strained diplomatic relations with South Korea - as well as many other Asian nations with conflicting views of Japan's war-time history - by nominating the specific historic period from 1850-1910, prior the controversial occupation of the Korean peninsular.
The Japanese government has also proposed to incorporate information centers at many of the sites, a gesture welcomed by Seoul. And, for the first time in post-war history, Japan acknowledged in a statement on Sunday that a large number of Koreans and others were "brought against their will and forced to work under harsh conditions in the 1940s at some of the sites."
Tokyo, however, has said that its policy toward South Korean and reparations to the forced laborers has not changed. A 1965 treaty includes a reparations package of some $800 million in grants and cheap loans.

In an interview with a gay Chicago newspaper, CNN's openly-gay African-American anchor Don Lemon warned that the same Bible that was used to "keep us as slaves" is now a weapon against gay people.
"We have, in many ways, been a victim of the Scriptures and theology that have been used to keep us as slaves," Lemon claimed, talking about the African-American culture. "It's been ingrained us (sic), and now we use it against gay people without thinking about things objectively."
That was not the first time Lemon spoke of Scripture in such a fashion. He also asserted back in June that literal interpretation of the Bible is "naive, even dangerous."
In his interview with the Windy City times, an LGBT newspaper, Lemon professed that he is not an activist. "I see myself just a normal person who is an 'accidental role model," the openly-gay CNN anchor maintained.
The same anchor who defended his objectivity even after he came out accepted the "Courage Award" two weeks ago from an LGBT organization, the "Anti-Violence Project." He will also be speaking at the U.S. Conference on Aids in November, which will focus on gay men.
"I hope to change minds," Lemon affirmed to gay newspaper The Washington Blade back in May, when asked of the possibility he could change minds given that he had come out.

Jennifer Lawrence famously called herself an “obese,” “fat actress,” claimed that she doesn't diet, loves junk food and has been told to lose weight for a role. She's also said “nothing can motivate me [to work out].”
It turns out it was all a lie: The 23-year-old “Hunger Games” actress exercised quite a bit to prepare for her role as Katniss Everdeen, according to her personal trainer.
Dr. Joe Horrigan, a chiropractic sports medicine doctor who has trained actors for movies like “The Matrix” and “Charlie's Angels,” revealed to Teen Vogue he was called to get Lawrence “in shape quickly” for her role in “The Hunger Games.”
"Jennifer was an utmost professional," Horrigan told Teen Vogue. "She was never late. She never missed a workout. She never complained. She did everything that was asked of her and she usually did so with a smile."
Horrigan said Lawrence's fitness regimen is composed of five parts: cardio, strength training, yoga, routine and attitude.
For cardio, which promotes blood circulation as well as helping “stamina, endurance and overall health,” Lawrence reportedly chose “skipping.” Horrigan also recommended a five- to 10-minute warm-up before 20 minutes of high-intensity cardio, like "running, cycling (road, mountain, classes, or simply a regular stationary bike), or various aerobic classes such as dance classes and hiking.”
Lawrence also built up her muscles to play Katniss. As Horrigan said, the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn. He suggested a 20-minute high intensity routine of "bodyweight squats, push-ups and sit-ups” or jumping rope in a circuit. Circuit training is doing one exercise for 30 seconds before moving on to another.
Yoga was also a part of Lawrence's workout plan on her off-days, to stretch, improve flexibility and relax her body between high-intensity workouts. Lawrence's low-intensity yoga routine included sun salutations, reverse warriors, chair poses, planks and tree poses, according to Horrigan.
Another important part of Lawrence's workout was staying consistent as well as alternating routines each day. Horrigan said mixing up a workout regimen keeps the body from “plateauing.” He suggested a four-day routine of cardio the first day, strength training the second, mixing both on the third day and yoga on the fourth.
Horrigan also said keeping a positive attitude about working out, like JLaw, will make it that much easier to achieve fitness goals.
Lawrence's new attitude about working out may come as a surprise as the actress has gone on rants in the media about her poor eating habits and lack of motivation to work out.
In the December 2012 issue of Elle, Lawrence said she is “considered a fat actress” and “obese” for Hollywood standards. She also asserted that she eats “like a caveman” and would never lose weight for a role.
“I'm never going to starve myself for a part,” she said. “I keep waiting for that one role to come along that scares me enough into dieting, and it just can't happen. I'm invincible.”
Lawrence also claimed to be eating junk food frequently while watching reality television in South African Marie Claire's January 2013 edition.
"At the end of the day there's probably nothing that makes me feel better than junk food and reality TV,” she told the magazine.
She also dished on her bad eating habits in an interview with British tabloid The Sun in March 2013, admitting she doesn't think of herself as “sexy.”
"The other day I had pizza for breakfast, buffalo wings for lunch and pizza for dinner," she told The Sun. "Probably my favorite food is a potato -- just a potato, because I like fries, boiled potatoes, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes."
In another interview with Harper's Bazaar UK last October, Lawrence said she was “hurt” by Hollywood execs who called her “fat.”
“Somebody told me I was fat, that I was going to get fired if I didn't lose a certain amount of weight," Lawrence said. "They brought in pictures of me where I was basically naked, and told me to use them as motivation for my diet."
Most recently, she referred on the 2014 SAG Awards red carpet to having a fear of fat under her armpit she called “armpit vagina.”
But despite it all, Lawrence may have been lying to the media all along, now that her trainer has outed her for working out. Last December, the actress said would never work out, even for a role.
"Nothing can motivate me," she told InStyle magazine. "During 'Hunger Games,' when I was eating ungodly amounts, I used to tell myself, 'Stop eating, people are going to see this. This movie is going to be around forever.' But nope! I was like, I still want candy and I still want a hot dog! Then 'X-Men' started, and I thought, 'Oh definitely, I'll work out and diet.' But nope. Not me!"
A recent study from scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies suggests that a strawberry a day (or more accurately, 37 of them) could keep not just one doctor away, but an entire fleet of them, including the neurologist, the endocrinologist, and maybe even the oncologist.
Investigations conducted in the Salk Institute's Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory (CNL) will appear in the June 27, 2011, issue of PLoS ONE. The report explains that fisetin, a naturally-occurring flavonoid found most abundantly in strawberries and to a lesser extent in other fruits and vegetables, lessens complications of diabetes. Previously, the lab showed that fisetin promoted survival of neurons grown in culture and enhanced memory in healthy mice. That fisetin can target multiple organs strongly suggests that a single drug could be used to mitigate numerous medical complications.
"This manuscript describes for the first time a drug that prevents both kidney and brain complications in a type 1 diabetes mouse model," says David Schubert, Ph.D., professor and head of the Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory and one of the manuscript's co-authors. "Moreover, it demonstrates the probable molecular basis of how the therapeutic is working."
Pam Maher, Ph.D., a senior staff scientist in the CNL, is the study's corresponding author. Maher initially identified fisetin as a neuroprotective flavonoid ten years ago. "In plants, flavonoids act as sunscreens and protect leaves and fruit from insects," she explains. "As foods they are implicated in the protective effect of the 'Mediterranean Diet.'"
Other celebrity flavonoids include polyphenolic compounds in blueberries and red wine.
Although her group's focus is neurobiology, Maher and colleagues reasoned that, like other flavonoids, fisetin might ameliorate a spectrum of disorders seen in diabetic patients. To test this, they evaluated effects of fisetin supplementation in Akita mice, a very robust model of type 1 diabetes, also called childhood onset diabetes.
Akita mice exhibit increased blood sugar typical of type 1 diabetes and display pathologies seen in serious human complications of both type 1 and 2 diabetes. Those include diabetic nephropathy or kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathies in which patients lose touch or heat sensations.
Mice fed a fisetin-enriched diet remained diabetic, but acute kidney enlargement-or hypertrophy-seen in untreated mice was reversed, and high urine protein levels, a sure sign of kidney disease, fell. Moreover, fisetin ingestion ameliorated anxiety-related behaviors seen in diabetic mice. "Most mice put in a large area become exploratory," says Maher. "But anxious mice tend not to move around. Akita mice showed enhanced anxiety behavior, but fisetin feeding restored their locomotion to more normal levels."
The study also defines a likely molecular mechanism underlying these effects. Researchers observed that blood and brain levels of sugars affixed to proteins known as advanced glycation end-products-or AGEs-were reduced in fisetin-treated compared to untreated Akita mice. These decreases were accompanied by increased activity of the enzyme glyoxalase 1, which promotes removal of toxic AGE precursors.
The discovery of an AGE-antagonizing enzyme upregulated by fisetin is very intriguing, because substantial evidence implicates high blood AGE levels with many if not most diabetic complications. "We know that fisetin increases activity of the glyoxalase enzyme and may increase its expression," says Maher. "But what is important is that ours is the first report that any compound can enhance glyoxalase 1 activity."
Interestingly, excessively high AGE levels also correlate with inflammatory activity thought to promote some cancers. In fact, studies published by others confirm that fisetin decreases tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells both in culture and in animal models, which if supported would represent a major added incentive to eat your strawberries.
To ingest fisetin levels equivalent to those fed Akita mice, Maher estimates that humans would have to eat 37 strawberries a day, assuming that strawberry fisetin is as readily metabolizable by humans as fisetin-spiked lab chow is by mice. Rather than through diet, Maher envisions that fisetin-like drugs could be taken as a supplement.
Schubert notes that fisetin is also effective in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. "We and others have shown that diabetes may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, making identification of a safe prophylactic like fisetin highly significant," he says.
Maher acknowledges that the public may be suffering from flavonoid-fatigue, given media coverage of the promises of these compounds. "Polyphenolics like fisetin and those in blueberry extracts are found in fruits and vegetables and are related to each other chemically," she says. "There is increasing evidence that they all work in multiple diseases. Hopefully some combination of these compounds will eventually get to the clinic."
Schubert concurs that their findings only reinforce what common sense and our mothers told us was a healthy lifestyle. "Eat a balanced diet and as much freshly prepared organic food as possible, get some exercise, keep socially and mentally active and avoid sodas with sugar and highly processed foods since they can contain high levels of AGEs," he advises.
But he also worries that hoops that must be jumped through to bring a natural product like fisetin, as opposed to a totally synthetic drug, to clinical trials are daunting because it is difficult to protect patents on natural products. "We will never know if a compound like fisetin works in humans until someone is willing to support a clinical trial."

Roberto Azevêdo says leave vote would present complex and unusual situation with UK unable to ‘cut and paste' its former EU-negotiated trade deals
Negotiations about the shape of the UK's post-Brexit trade arrangements would have to start from scratch after a leave vote in the EU referendum, the head of the World Trade Organisation said as he admitted there had been no preliminary discussions with the UK government.
Roberto Azevêdo, the WTO director-general, said he expected any talks to be long and difficult, adding: “We haven't had any discussions about the process. We don't know what the process would be. We do know it would be a very unusual situation.”
Trade has featured heavily during the referendum campaign, with much debate about whether a post-Brexit UK would seek to retain its membership of the European single market or aim for a looser arrangement in which exporters had the same access as other WTO members.
Azevêdo said the position was complicated by the fact that all Britain's trade commitments had been negotiated by the EU and that these would cease to apply in the event of a decision to leave.
Warning that it would be impossible for the UK to “cut and paste” its old EU trade deals into new agreements, Azevêdo said the UK would be starting from scratch without the institutional machinery necessary to negotiate trade deals.
He said Britain did not have the investigative bodies that would look into issues such as steel dumping. “It doesn't have the official capacity. There is no institutional mechanism to conduct an investigation. That body of human resources would have to be set up fairly quickly.”
Azevêdo said he felt “uncomfortable” being dragged into the UK's referendum debate but thought it was right to counter a great deal of misinformation about the UK's future as a WTO member. He said there had been no pressure on him from the government to speak out.
“Britain is a member of the WTO and will continue to be a member of the WTO. But it will be a member with no country-specific commitments. We have had no other situation like that,” he said.
One of the leading figures on the leave side, Prof Patrick Minford, has said Britain could avoid protracted negotiations by adopting a free trade approach, under which the UK would impose no barriers on goods and services entering the country. Minford said this would help the economy by making imports cheaper.

Azevêdo said this would be an all-or-nothing approach: “If you are a duty-free country, you can't be selectively duty-free. If you want to go duty-free, you have to go duty-free across the board. There can be no tariffs on anything, including agriculture and steel.”
The WTO director-general has been seeking reductions in protectionism from member countries as part of his organisation's mission to promote free trade. He said: “If everybody went in a duty-free direction it would be a golden time for classical and orthodox economics.”
Noting that only Macau and Hong Kong adopted a complete duty-free approach, Azevêdo said: “I recognise reality for what it is. I think it is very unlikely it (a duty-free world) is going to come to pass.”
Azevêdo, who has been struggling to bring to a conclusion the Doha round of liberalisation talks which began in 2001, said he had no idea how long it would take the UK to negotiate trade deals afresh in the aftermath of a leave vote.
“It is very difficult to predict. Russia's accession to the WTO took 20 years. Other negotiations happened faster. It will be a very high risk bet to hope that negotiations would be quickly completed and that negotiations would be uneventful,” he said.
In 2010, the Obama Administration endorsed, then immediately condemned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) calls for a nuclear-free Middle East, realizing after the agreement that Israel is the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East.
Fast-forward five years, and there still hasn't been a meeting on the matter. The big obstacle is that Israel, which is not a signatory to the NPT, is willing to attend the talks but not willing to even broach the subject of disarmament, citing the fact that they're never publicly admitted to their significant arsenal in the first place.
Israel, of course, is blaming the Arabs for all this, saying the lack of talks underscores the fact that the Arab states, none of whom is a nuclear power to begin with, is even willing to sit down and talk with the nuclear-armed Israelis.
Israel's status at the meeting did indeed loom large, and was a big part of why the talks never took place, though it was the fact that there was no hope of getting the only nuclear-armed nation to disarm that really soured most nations on the talks, figuring there was no point in the absence of that as at least a speculative goal.
Indeed, all these same nations routinely work with Israel on efforts to detect illegal underground nuclear testing as part of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In that case, unlike this one, there was hope of actually accomplishing thing, however.
And that's been the fatal flaw in the push for a nuclear-free Middle East from the moment the US ill-conceivedly endorsed it way back in 2010. They believe it's “unfair” to single out Israel for disarmament, but Israel is the only state in the region with such arms to begin with, meaning efforts to orchestrate such talks always boil down to Israel insisting it is being mistreated and the US agreeing.
NEW DELHI: Saudi Arabia is easing restrictions on women drivers. Saudi Arabia was only country in the world to ban women from driving. Neither Islamic law nor Saudi traffic law explicitly prohibits women from driving, but they were not issued licences and were detained if they attempted to drive.Here is a look at things women in Saudi Arabia can do or can't do:1. Last week, women were allowed to enter a sports stadium in Riyadh for Saudi National Day — in a family section, away from single men2. They no longer require a guardian's permission to work3. This year, government allowed girls in public schools to play sports, have access to physical education4. In May, government offices were told to allow women to obtain services without permission from a guardian5. Expatriate women, once obliged to veil, now get away with only an abaya1. They can't marry, divorce, get a passport, travel, open a bank account or have a medical procedure without permission from their male guardians2. Women can't socialise with males outside their immediate families, can be imprisoned for such an offence3. They can't even eat at restaurants that don't have a separate family section4. They must wear an abaya (cloak) and veil in public places. However, in Riyadh, some women have started showing their faces5. Islamic restriction prevents Muslim women from marrying non-Muslims. Also, Sunni women can't marry a Shia man or a communist (atheist)6. They cannot conduct certain business, need at least two men who can testify to her character before she can be granted a loan or a licence7. In case of divorce, they can't retain custody of their children after they reach the age of seven for boys and nine for girls8. They can't get a fair hearing in court, where 'the testimony of one man equals that of two women.' The legal position in Saudi Arabia of a woman is equal to that of a minor, and therefore she has little authority over her own life9. She cannot receive an equal inheritance. Under Sharia inheritance laws, daughters receive half what is awarded to their brothers
A Brief History of Comic-Con International's Robert A. Heinlein Blood Drive
Then in the early 1970s, Heinlein had a life-threatening illness and needed many pints of a rare blood type. He felt he owed his life to the donors, so when asked to be a guest at the 1976 World Con in his hometown of Kansas City, he agreed-but with one specific stipulation: that he would only sign autographs for people who donated blood.
Thus longtime Comic-Con committee member Jackie Estrada approached the author with an offer to hold a blood drive in San Diego if he would consent to being a guest. He agreed, and in 1977 Heinlein came to Comic-Con. He and his wife, Ginny, had a great time and Heinlein even drew a picture for the Sunday morning Art Auction.
"David Scroggy [who went onto be a VP at Dark Horse Comics before he retired] was the first blood drive coordinator," recalls Estrada. "We also had Theodore Sturgeon there signing his book, Some of Your Blood, which he gave to all of the blood donors. We also had entertainment for the people while they were [donating blood]. I remember that Leslie Cabarga played the piano, C. C. Beck played the guitar. It was a very fun event and Robert was delighted. We've had the blood drive every year since."
Gulja is the capital of Ili prefecture in China's northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
More than 40 Uyghurs were detained last week because they failed to show up for a prominent Communist Party member's funeral in northwestern China's Xinjiang region, RFA's Uyghur Service has learned.
Included among the 41 people detained by authorities are local religious leaders from Oymanbaytoqay village of Ghulja (In Chinese, Yining) County including the Imam Enver Hesen and the Muezzin Ekber Nesirdin, local residents told RFA.
While local law-enforcement officials acknowledged they detained the Uyghurs, they said it was because they are religious extremists.
Tursun Bilal, a police officer of Araosteng Township who oversees Oymanbaytoqay village, told RFA that failure to show up at the funeral for a teacher a Chinese Communisst Party member surnamed Harun is a sure sign the 41 men are radicals.
A 'clear sign'
“They refused to attend the funeral ceremony of Mr. Harun despite being called and invited several times by Mr. Harun's family,” Tursun Bilal told RFA. “That fact, obviously indicates their anger toward Mr. Harun and a lack of loyalty to the government. More importantly, it is a clear sign of religious extremism.”
Harun, 70, who died in the first week of February, was a retired teacher from Oymanbaytoqay Primary School, but he was known for his loyalty to the government and membership in the Chinese Communist Party.
Abdushukur Abdurazaq, Chief of Police Station of Araosteng Township, said the group was transferred to the county's state security department.
He told RFA “the investigation is still continuing,” and cited Enver Hesen's education and background as reasons for suspicion. Enver Hesen was born and went to school in Kashgar (Kashi), the westernmost city in China that lies near the border with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
“The government appointed him as Imam as our old Imam passed away, but we have closely watched his life because of his educational background,” Abdushukur Abdurazaq said.
Local support
Locals defended the men, saying they didn't have anything against the late Harun.
“I know that the Imam Enver Hesen didn't say anything bad about Mr. Harun,” said Oymanbaytoqay Village Chief Niyaz Emet. “He just simply went about his business as he was invited to the funeral, but the absence of the other people, who are usually socially active members of our village community, was seen as result of Enver Hesen's provocation.”
Memet Eli, a veterinary surgeon in Araosteng Township, told RFA the men weren't known to be radical.
“I know the 41 men as normal Muslim people,” he said. “They just practiced their religious beliefs by praying five times a day, but I have not seen and don't believe they showed signs of extremism.”
Memet Eli said Enver Hesen called him several times about his sick cow.
“He did the treatment of his cow by fully following my diagnosis,” he explained. “I know that someone who is influenced by extremism is not calling a doctor about their cow.”
Village Chief Niyaz Emet said he doubts there's a link between the light turnout at the funeral and extremism.
“I don't believe that there is link between participation at Mr. Harun's funeral ceremony and the advocacy of Imam Enver Hesen to the community," he said. "That was regular course for the relationship between the party members of Chinese Communist Party and our community."

A Slow-Motion Bank Run In Europe
MICHEL GANGNE/AFP/Getty Images
Update: This post was published on Sept. 14. On Sept. 15, the European Central Bank, along with other central banks from around the world, announced a new lending program to fight the slow-motion run on Europe's banks. Here's more on that program.
Fear can wreck a banking system and cause havoc in an economy. That's why the recent worries about big French banks are so important, and so scary: Even without a Greek default, Europe could slide into a financial crisis.
For the past few months, what The Economist called a slow-motion run has been underway for big French banks. It looks different than the classic bank run, where ordinary people lose confidence in a bank and rush to pull their money out. That's because big European banks are different from traditional, Main Street banks.
At a Main Street bank, regular people put money in savings and checking accounts. This is, in effect, a short-term loan to the bank. The bank then takes that money and makes long-term loans to other regular people in the form of mortgages, small-business loans, and the like.
Big European banks work sort like that — but on a much, much bigger scale.
Big institutions like money-market funds lend billions of dollars to big European banks. These are short-term loans of a month or so.
The European banks take that money and make huge, long-term loans to big companies national governments. That includes loans to Greece (in the form of Greek bonds) and other countries with financial troubles.
Recently, many of the big institutions that lend money to French banks have grown worried about the banks' loans to Greece and other countries. So they've started pulling their money out of the banks.
For example, U.S. money market funds reduced their deposits in French banks by about a third between May and August of this year, according to one recent analyst report — that's tens of billions of dollars they've pulled out of French banks.
So far, French banks have been managing. They've been paying higher interest in order to borrow from other sources. In a pinch, they can also borrow from European Central Bank. This may allow them to muddle through, particularly if European leaders come up with a bigger, bolder bailout plan for Greece that eases investors' worries.
But if the slow-motion bank run continues, the banks may ultimately be forced to sell off bonds and other assets they hold. If several banks are forced to sell assets at the same time, the price of those assets will fall. It's simple supply and demand.
As Gary Jenkins of Evolution Securities put it when I talked to him this morning: "If all the banks go, who is buying?"
In the language of finance, this can push a bank from liquidity to insolvency.
At the beginning, the bank is fundamentally sound, but can't come up with enough money to meet its short-term needs. It has liquidity problems.
So it's forced into a fire sale of its assets. This drives down the assets' value. The fall in value means that the bank is no longer fundamentally sound — it's insolvent. In plain terms, the bank is bust.
The big French banks are too big to fail. So instead of going bust, they would get a bailout from the French government.
But this would likely be an ugly, scary process. It would cause more fear, and more problems, in financial markets throughout Europe and beyond. It could, in short, be another financial crisis.

GERMAN POLICE HAVE launched a manhunt for a Tunisian man suspected of driving the truck that ploughed through a Berlin Christmas market in a deadly assault claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group.
The man has been named as 24-year-old Anis Amri.
The federal prosecutors office have offered a reward of €100,000 for information leading to the arrest of Amri, who they warned “could be violent and armed”.
Media reports said asylum office papers believed to belong to the man were found in the cab of the 40-tonne lorry used in the attack that killed 12 people on Monday.
Amri was born in the southern city of Tataouine, the reports said.
He applied for asylum in Germany in April and received a temporary residence permit, according to the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
A previous suspect — a 23-year-old Pakistani asylum seeker — was released late yesterday for lack of evidence, prompting fears of a killer on the loose and further rattling nerves in a shocked country.
Twelve people were killed when the Polish-registered articulated truck, laden with steel beams, slammed into the crowded holiday market late on Monday, smashing wooden stalls and crushing victims.
Twenty four people remain in hospital, 14 of whom were seriously injured, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said.
Nightmare
The scenes instantly revived nightmarish memories of the 14 July truck assault in the French Riviera city of Nice, where 86 people were killed by a Tunisian Islamist.
The IS-linked Amaq news agency said “a soldier of the Islamic State” carried out the Berlin carnage “in response to appeals to target citizens of coalition countries”.
There was no evidence to back the claim, nor was the perpetrator identified.
Germany is part of a US-led coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria.
De Maiziere said several lines of inquiry were being pursued, but “we should let the security services do their job”.
“No-one will rest until the perpetrator or perpetrators have been caught,” he told ARD public television.

The attack comes at a sensitive time for Chancellor Angela Merkel who is running for a fourth term in 2017 but has faced strong criticism over her decision last year to open the country's borders to refugees.
‘Dangerous criminal'
In a blow to investigators, federal prosecutors announced they had to release the only suspect in custody after finding no forensic evidence to link him to Germany's deadliest attack in recent years.
The Pakistani man was arrested late on Monday evening after he was reportedly seen jumping out of the truck and fleeing the scene.
But officials had expressed growing doubts over whether they had the right suspect in custody.
“We may have a dangerous criminal in the area,” Berlin's police chief Klaus Kandt said, adding that security would be boosted while urging “heightened vigilance”.
Following the suspect's release, Kandt told ARD television “one or more” perpetrators were believed to be on the run and possibly armed.
Images from the aftermath showed the mangled truck with its windscreen smashed, a trail of destruction in its wake, while survivors recounted harrowing stories of near misses and bloody carnage.
Germany in mourning
A Polish man, killed with a gunshot, was found on the truck's passenger seat, said de Maiziere. He was believed to be the initial driver of the Polish-registered vehicle.
Merkel visited the scene of the carnage for a minute's silence yesterday and then joined a memorial service in the adjacent Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.
Mourners placed flowers and candles at the site while German flags flew at half-mast.

Berlin's landmark Brandenburg Gate was lit in the national colours in honour of the victims, and foreign leaders, led by US President Barack Obama, sent their condolences.
Europe has been on high alert for most of 2016, with bloody jihadist attacks striking Paris and Brussels.
In July, 15 people were injured in two attacks in the southern German state of Bavaria committed by asylum seekers and claimed by the Islamic State group.
The arrival of 890,000 refugees last year has polarised Germany, with critics calling the influx a serious security threat.
Opponents were quick to seize on the rampage as proof that Merkel's liberal asylum policy had endangered the country.
Marcus Pretzell of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party labelled the Christmas market victims “Merkel's dead”.

Media Matters founder David Brock blames Hillary Clinton's campaign staffers for her 2016 election loss.
The Free Beacon obtained a copy of a speech Brock is set to deliver to Democratic donors, in which he claims Clinton staffers refused to use opposition research compiled by Brock's Super-PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, that would have led to Donald Trump's defeat.
In the speech, Brock argued Clinton should have characterized Trump “not just [as] a sexual predator, but also an economic predator.”
“Top strategists [within the Clinton campaign], however, chose not to push,” that narrative, Brock's speech reads.
“Bridge amassed reams of evidence of Trump screwing over average Americans with his predatory business practices, but as we did no paid advertising, we were only able to shop these soties in earned media,” he continued. “Much of the public never heard the devastating personal testimonials of Trump's treachery and greed collected by Bridge, which, in retrospect, might well have moved some of the working class white voters.”
“Did Hillary's own campaign rob her of the only anti-Trump argument that would have opened up the all-important economic issue to her advantage?” the speech rhetorically asks. “That's the inescapable conclusion.”

WASHINGTON -- New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is arguing once again that all the Bush-era tax cuts, including those on the first $250,000 in annual income, should be allowed to expire at the end of 2012.
Bloomberg said it was folly to argue that the economy was in too fragile a state to absorb such a hike. In a phone interview with The Huffington Post, he also made the case that voters would reward President Barack Obama with a landslide victory in November if he called the Republicans' bluff on the matter.
"What Obama should do is say he's going to veto any change to the end of the expiration of the Bush era tax cuts for everybody, and I feel very strongly about the because you don't want to split the country -- that's not what America is all about," said Bloomberg.
"Obama would win this election going away if he'd stand up and say, 'I'm gonna do this,' and then turn to Republicans and say, 'You know, you didn't want any more revenues ... I just outfoxed you. Now work with me on cutting expenses, and we'll actually balance the budget in 10 years, and we'll do it responsibly.'"
Bloomberg first made the case for a temporary extension of the Bush-era tax cuts in the summer of 2010. But for the past year or so, his position has been that the rates should revert to Clinton-era levels for incomes across the board, and that the savings could be used to offset a cut in business taxes.
"If you look at taxes versus other countries around the world, our business taxes are higher than average," Bloomberg said, "but our personal income taxes are lower."
The comments were the first Bloomberg has made since the Senate passed a bill to keep the Bush-era rates in place only on income below $250,000 and the House passed a bill that would have extended rates for all income brackets. Both bills would only last for one year, in hopes that Congress could pass more comprehensive tax policy reform in the interim. A top Democratic Senate aide said that there are currently "a number of different venues" in which the two chambers could find agreement, but movement wasn't likely to happen until the closing months of the calendar year.
Few shares the mayor's sentiment that all the tax cuts should be allowed to expire. While former Obama budget chief Peter Orszag has made a similar argument, the president himself has argued that tax cuts should only expire for those in the top two percent of income brackets. Other Democrats have said the tax cuts should begin for those earning $1 million in income.
As a political matter, Bloomberg argued that Obama would be better off pushing for a full repeal of the Bush-era tax cuts because it would be the easiest type of bill to pass.
"He's just got to sustain the veto of any law that ends the tax cuts. That's the great thing. And then he has really stuck it to the Republicans," Bloomberg said. "If you say, 'Well, we're not going to do that, we're going to fix the tax law' -- let's get serious."

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister David Cameron favors holding a referendum on Britain's European Union membership in June next year if leaders of other member states agree to the bulk of his reform plans at a December summit, The Times newspaper reported on Monday.
Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's ties with the 28-nation bloc ahead of a membership vote by the end of 2017.
Cameron's office said the government had not made any decisions on the date of the vote. “As the Prime Minister has said, what will determine the timing of the referendum is the outcome of the negotiation, within the deadline of the end of 2017.”
On Tuesday he is due to publish a letter to the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, outlining his reform demands. He will also warn that if no deal can be reached, he could back a British exit.
Citing officials, The Times said EU allies had been told that if a December summit of EU leaders goes well, Cameron would prefer to hold the referendum in June 2016. It said he had been persuaded by other EU leaders that the vote should not be delayed, with another migration crisis likely next summer.
Opinion polls show most Britons favor staying within the EU although support for remaining versus leaving has narrowed in recent months, with many voters citing concerns over migration.
I was honestly hoping that my 500th post to this website would be a memorable one, and it appears that the blogging gods have indeed decided to smile upon me for this auspicious occasion.
First, I am proud to announce that A Voice for Men will now be bringing you weekly video news reports on what is happening in the AVfM world. Nurdy Dancing, fellow angry white male and all around oppressor, has joined the AVfM team to bring you onsite news dedicated solely to matters AVfM. They will be located in a post to the main articles, like this one, and in the featured video spot at the right of the page.
As if this were not great already, one of the subjects of Nurdydancing's first weekly report is one near and dear to the heart of MRAs. Many of you will remember the recent coverage of the MRM posters going up in Vancouver, as reported by Derek Bedry of openfile.ca. It was Mr. Bedry that made the false allegations that MRAs were linked to terrorist organizations, mass murderers and other social miscreants. Of course he did so without any proof, and without even addressing the posters that were supposedly so objectionable.
I could tell you more, but it would be more fitting to let you hear about it from AVfM newscaster, Nurdydancing.
At this time I should update the report in the video. We will be making an announcement about the new activism committee later in the week. As reported, we will be continuing and expanding our outing of corrupt public officials and false accusers. But I suppose we should add to the list journalists who actually create the news they are reporting on, and con the reading public into thinking they are an objective professional reporting the facts.
We understand that some AVfM readers my want contact information for the editor of openfile.ca, as some readers may want to question that news source as to why one of their reporters is engaged in such malicious deception of their readers for the sake of his own political activism. They may want to ask why anyone reading a site employing Derek Bedry should believe anything that openfile.ca publishes.
What's next openfile? Are your reporters going to steal cars and then report on the crime problem?

With apologies to Michael Lewis, what if everything you thought you knew about baseball was wrong? As our collective understanding of advanced statistical analysis in baseball grows exponentially with each passing day, we are now among a generation of baseball fans that has done more critical thinking about and retained more esoteric knowledge of the game than our parents could ever have dreamed of. Anyone who has seen MLB Network's show on the evolution of statistics would think that between Henry Chadwick's invention of the box score and Branch Rickey's hiring of Alan Roth as a statistician, baseball fans in the 20th century consumed baseball metrics in only the most rudimentary of ways — via the dreaded batting average, home runs and RBI triumvirate.
However, what if I told you that one of the most advanced analytical discoveries — one that sabermetricians hold near and dear to their hearts — was actually discovered before Babe Ruth ever played a game?
My dad gave me Michael Lewis' “Moneyball” when I was 13 years old. Up until that point, I had every statistic on the back of every baseball card memorized. I would spend hours organizing and reorganizing my seemingly infinite collection of cards — always checking the numbers before placing a card into a new position. Michael Lewis ruined this childhood passion. Knowing that Bernie Williams hit .338 in 1998, narrowly beating out Mo Vaughan (.337) for the batting title just didn't seem that important anymore. Long story short, I had to know everything about baseball I didn't already know. My progression began with on-base percentage, grew to OPS, and I eventually stumbled upon the likes of FIP and wOBA. As a teenager, I simply believed these metrics were all invented by Bill James, who I imagined being like Vito Corleone with Tom Tango as Tom Hagen and Voros McCraken as Michael Corleone.
Returning to the present day, I‘m currently in the midst of writing my college thesis (yes, it's on baseball), and I recently came across a piece of research that sounded my “wow, everything I thought I knew about baseball is wrong” alarm to claxon-like levels. In the 1915 edition of Baseball Magazine (distributed from 1908-1957), there's an article written by F.C. Lane that would make even Tom Tango take notice (assuming he isn't already aware of its existence): “Why the System of Batting Averages Should Be Changed: Statistics Lie at the Foundation of Baseball Popularity — Batting Records Are the Favorite — And Yet Batting Records Are Unnecessarily Inaccurate.”
Lane opens his discussion with a question: “Suppose you asked a close personal friend how much change he had in his pocket and he replied, ‘Twelve coins,' would you think you had learned much about the precise state of his exchequer?” He goes on to compare two mens' respective financial situations: Man A, with “twelve coins” consisting of a combination of quarters, nickels, and dimes; and Man B, with twelve silver dollars. Saying both men have equal financial means is equivalent to the system of tracking batting averages, he explains. “One batter, we may say, made twelve singles, three or four of them of the scratchiest possible variety. The other also made twelve hits, but all of them were good ringing drives, clean cut and decisive, three of them were doubles, one a triple, and one a home run…Is there no way to separate the dimes from the nickels and give each its proper value?” Sound familiar?
“If these averages mislead or give mistaken ideas of batting ability they forfeit their only excuse in being?”
This issue was not solely unique to Lane's inquisitiveness. John Heydler, secretary and future president of the National League, added, “that the system of giving as much credit to singles as to home runs is inaccurate to that extent. But it has never seemed practicable to use any other system. How, for instance, are you going to give the comparative values of home runs and singles?”
Lane wasn't satisfied with Heydler's admission that even though the system was broken, it couldn't be fixed. To prove Heydler wrong, the question Lane would attempt to answer was simple: “What constitutes the value of a hit?” “A hit,” Lane says, “is valuable in so far as it results in a score. The entire aim of a baseball team at bat is to score runs. Hits, stolen bases, taking advantage of errors — in short, all the departments of play — are but details in the process of scoring runs.”
Lane continues to outline what appears to be a very early version of weighted on-base average (wOBA). Before he concludes his argument, he makes another discovery that took the rest of us about 80 years to figure out. Lane compares Jake Daubert — who hit for a high batting average — and Gavvy Cravath, who Lane claims is a much better player, even with his sub-.300 batting average.
To make this comparison, Lane looks at the league average figures for singles, doubles, triples and home runs (77.44%, 14.80%, 5.51%, and 2.24%, respectively) and compares those numbers to each player's numbers. Daubert's hit breakdown was as follows: 79.47% singles, 13.90% doubles, 5.29% triples and 1.33% home runs. “In other words,” explains Lane, “Jake made more singles and fewer extra base hits than the general average right down the line. Jake had a lot of coins in his pockets, but many of them were nickels and dimes.” Cravath, on the other hand, had the following breakdown: 59.38% singles, 20.80% doubles, 4.69% triples and 16.12% home runs. Lane breaks down the numbers further, assigning the proper (his idea of the correct) values to each hit, thus creating a weighted batting average. Comparing a player's weighted figures to the league averages seems quite a bit similar to what we know as wRC+ today, wouldn't you say?
Clearly the baseball universe did not end up adopting these types of analyses back then. Even today, most fans are just beginning to realize just how one-dimensional batting average is. MLB Network's aforementioned special on statistics called OPS the gateway drug, and noted that fans are beginning to realize that OBP and SLG are better metrics than AVG. While the more advanced figures like wOBA and wRC+ are still relatively unknown to the baseball masses, even they seem to be slowly seeping into the wider baseball zeitgeist.
“Let it be hoped that 1916, the dawn of a new day in baseball affairs, will witness as well the dawn of a new day in the outworn method of keeping batting averages. The time has passed when the public will any longer swallow the palpable falsehood that a home run is no better than a scratch single. It knows better, instinctively feels better, and should be told the truth by a presentation of the season's statistics founded upon a sane, workmanlike basis.”
If only Lane could've seen just how far his theories have come.
UPDATE: Greta Van Susteren's MSNBC show "For The Record" will reportedly begin January 9.
After running a proto-fascist campaign, President-elect Donald Trump will bring his hate, misogyny, and bigotry to the White House at the end of the month. And when he does, NBC will have a machine ready to normalize him. Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough is cozying up to Trump, the network is literally paying Trump through Celebrity Apprentice, and MSNBC is reportedly in talks to hire Greta Van Susteren, a longtime Fox News host with a history of treating Trump with kid gloves. And now Megyn Kelly, who famously buried the hatchet with Trump by lobbing him a softball interview and then withheld information about him until after the election, is also going to work for NBC.
By any measure, the Trump normalization effort at NBC begins at the top, with the network actually paying money to Trump as a result of his Celebrity Apprentice executive producer credit. The problem here is simple: NBC will have a fiduciary relationship with the president of the United States. The network now has an incentive to weigh aggressive reporting about the president-elect against what it might lose in revenue if Trump's reputation is damaged. NBC, after all, is the network that had the hot mic tape of Trump bragging about sexual assault -- but it's not the outlet that broke that news.
The tangles of the Trump-NBC connection were reflected in Matt Lauer's recent interview with new Celebrity Apprentice host Arnold Schwarzenegger, in which the two downplayed the conflict of interest posed by Trump's role in the show. Far from raising concerns about a financial arrangement between a network and the president, Lauer instead teased the increasing personal involvement Trump could have on the show as the season goes on. That's normalization, and it's driven by a desire for profit margin, plain and simple. As the Trump administration draws nearer, we're seeing signs that this approach could repeat itself in the news division.
Megyn Kelly
Megyn Kelly announced her move to NBC on Tuesday. Kelly's schtick is old hat for those who watch Fox News closely. She'll have one good moment that gets an absurd amount of press and defines the narrative, and she'll follow it up by making numerous terrible remarks -- often involving bigotry or race baiting of some kind -- that mainstream journalists just seem to forget in the long run. In fact, promoting bigotry was something of a specialty for Kelly at Fox News, as she helped build her name by obsessively pushing the baseless conspiracy that the Obama administration had declined to pursue voter intimidation charges against the New Black Panther Party for racial and political reasons. She would later infamously declare that both Santa Claus and Jesus were white. As Gawker's Sam Biddle put it, “To Megyn Kelly, black rage is pervasive when she wants you scared, insignificant when she wants you ignorant.”
The thing is, with a certain crowd of media elites, Kelly's terrible remarks never stick the way the good moments do. Just look at all the mainstream positive puff pieces on Kelly. One is left to wonder how many of these people regularly watched her show.
Her experience with Trump during the 2016 election is typical Megyn Kelly: In the first presidential primary debate, she confronted Trump about his track record of insulting women. With that query, she cemented her reputation among two crowds: the media elites who loved it, and the “alt-right” misogynists who are railing against Kelly to this day.
But despite her very public feud with Trump, during the campaign, Kelly's Fox News show was a perfect example of normalization. Even though she posed a tough question to Trump during the debate (and asked the occasional tough question to his surrogates), she also gave Trump a welcoming platform and reinforced the bigoted tropes that he built his campaign on.
Even weeks before the debate, Kelly had set the tone for her campaign, defending Trump's racist remarks about immigrants by positively citing Ann Coulter's book Adios America.
And then, just days after being showered with mainstream praise for her debate question, Kelly turned to disgraced former detective Mark Fuhrman for analysis about protests in Ferguson, MO. (Fuhrman is so racist that even Fox News host and Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson has called him a bigot.) And in the weeks and months following the debate, while Trump raged about Kelly and the press ate it up, Kelly was mainstreaming a hate group, pushing bigotry against transgender people, complaining about a “thug mentality” in black communities, sneering at black protesters, and attacking a Department of Justice plan to address anti-Muslim rhetoric. Kelly blamed African-Americans who were the victims of police violence and even lashed out at one black protester for looking a police officer in the eyes. And all this was just in 2015, not to mention 2016. None of this behavior got the press that her big moment confronting Trump did.
And even when Kelly failed, it didn't stick. Her prime-time show on Fox Broadcasting Co. last May was supposed to be a huge breakout moment. It was her chance to show she could be a “star” without the lower expectations that come with being a journalist on Fox News. Instead, the show was roundly considered a disaster, and it contained one of the worst Trump interviews of the entire election, up there with anything Sean Hannity aired. And yet, when news broke of Kelly moving to NBC, this catastrophe was largely forgotten.
That's not all. Kelly met with Trump before the taping of that special and then withheld details about the meeting in order to make news with her book, Settle For More, released November 15. It was only after the election that Kelly revealed Trump was trying to bribe journalists behind the scenes. If Kelly's secretive meeting with Trump sounds familiar, it's because her new colleague Joe Scarborough is playing the same game.
Joe Scarborough
Scarborough spent a good part of the election season carrying water for Trump. He questioned whether the timing of sexual assault allegations against Trump were “a coincidence.” He defended a Trump ad that the ADL condemned as anti-Semitic. He lied about Trump's prior foreign policy positions. He mocked David Fahrenthold's reporting for The Washington Post about the Trump Foundation. He called Trump's racism and bigotry just part of a “character” that Trump was playing. He ignored Trump scandals. He excused Trump's rhetoric, claiming Trump was “exhausted” from being on television. He credited Trump with a “dominating” debate performance. He dismissed Trump's history of birtherism. He sneered at the idea that Trump was graded on a curve. He downplayed a comprehensive New York Times report on Trump's treatment of women.
Like Kelly, when Scarborough and his co-host were given a high-profile prime-time interview with Trump, they completely dropped the ball, conducting a friendly chat rather than pressing him on any issue. (The casual tone continued when the cameras were off.) It's no wonder that even a conservative radio host declared that Scarborough had “turned his show into a Trump Super PAC for six months.” An NBC pollster made a similar point. And Morning Joe devolved into a screaming match when Bill Kristol called out Scarborough for “rewriting history.”
From time to time, Scarborough was lucid about the danger Trump poses, even as late as August when Scarborough demanded the GOP ditch Trump as its nominee. Famously, Scarborough told viewers that Trump had allegedly asked during a security briefing why America cannot use its nuclear weapons. But Scarborough's occasional Trump skepticism never lasted.
Since the election, Scarborough and Brzezinski have been all in for Trump. They have met with him in person and even boasted on air that they “speak frequently” with the president-elect. Scarborough said that he personally thinks Trump believes in climate science, despite evidence to the contrary. He also downplayed pro-Trump fake news, and he and Brzezinski both tried to whitewash the racism and bigotry out of Trump's campaign.
Along with meeting with Trump and defending him on air, Scarborough and Brzezinski also regularly get scoops on his transition. In December, the pair, dressed in pajamas for their holiday show, broke the news that Trump was willing to start a nuclear arms race.
Scarborough also recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago during Trump's New Year's' Eve party.
Scarborough denied being there for a party, telling CNN's Brian Stelter that he was meeting with Trump to lobby for an on-air interview and that he was surprised to see people in tuxedos when he arrived. On Monday, he spoke with CNN's Dylan Byers about the uproar over the incident, repeatedly invoking other reporters' relationships with various politicians to defend himself.
Scarborough's defensive answers to Byers give away one major problem with his close relationship with Trump: The need to protect Trump's reputation can cloud Scarborough's judgment. Morning Joe's absurd defense of Trump's position on climate change is a perfect example. With no proof in his favor, Scarborough simply asserted that Trump believes in climate science, ignoring mountains of evidence to the contrary.
Greta Van Susteren
Trump's increasingly gushing coverage on MSNBC may soon not be limited to Morning Joe. MSNBC reportedly may hire former Fox News host Greta Van Susteren for its 6 p.m. hour (Update: Van Susteren's move is now official). Van Susteren has given Trump a welcoming platform for years. Before the Republican primary, Trump appeared more times on Van Susteren's On The Record than on the rest of the Fox News prime-time shows combined. During the Republican primary, Van Susteren had Trump on for over five hours, dwarfing other candidates. During these appearances, Trump pushed birtherism, claimed Obama didn't write his own memoir, and made bigoted remarks about refugees. And Andrew Kaczynski chronicled more of Trump's moments from Van Susteren's show.
To be fair, On The Record was not the worst on Fox News, and Van Susteren may well have been playing to the conservative audience. But the absolute worst Trump hagiographic moment during his campaign came during her “documentary” interview with his campaign. Here's how the special looks when you take out the Trump family's answers.
Onlookers harshly criticized the special, with MSNBC host -- and potential future colleague -- Chris Hayes declaring that it was reminiscent of state media under a dictator.
A glimpse of what state media will look like after Glorious Leader Trump is victorious. https://t.co/5viCwg9OBg — Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) May 26, 2016
As of now, Van Susteren's hiring is still a rumor and may not come to pass. But either way, a likely factor in MSNBC's desire to add her to its lineup is her established track record of getting access to Trump, which she certainly didn't accomplish because she subjected him to tough interviews.
What the future may bring
There are other problem spots on NBC News and MSNBC. Meet The Press fell for Trump's spin on climate change, just as it bought his take on North Carolina's anti-LGBTQ law. The show has also at various points ignored or glossed over stories like the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Trump University settlement, the investigation of the Trump Foundation, the proven lawbreaking at the Trump Foundation, the Democracy Spring protests, some of Trump's sketchy ties to Russia, the EPA's Clean Power Plan, and the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. The hosts did find time to let Iraq War architect Paul Wolfowitz relitigate the invasion. They also let Glenn Beck attempt to rehabilitate his reputation -- twice. And it's not just one show. The spectre of increasing Trump normalization talk on MSNBC brings to mind the network's shady history in the first term of the Bush administration.
MSNBC's prime-time voices like Chris Hayes, Rachel Maddow, and Lawrence O'Donnell are resisting efforts to normalize Trump. But it's unclear whether they can win that fight with the leading voices at MSNBC and NBC News pushing the other way, much less with the network itself in bed with Trump. And if Trump puts net neutrality rules on the table, NBC's parent company, Comcast, would surely have an interest.
All of these bears close watching. But the long and short of it is that the network seems primed to become a Trump normalization machine.
In short, Fox News finally has competition.

SEANAD leader Mary O'Rourke was last night in hot water after saying some of her campaign helpers had worked "like blacks".
She used the phrase while thanking her campaign workers for getting her selected for the third spot on the Fianna Fail general election ticket for Longford-Westmeath.
Her 'blacks' comment drew loud groans from the crowd.
Asked afterwards what she meant, an obviously taken aback Mrs O'Rourke said: "I just meant that they worked very hard."
Last night there was surprise at her comments given her excellent record on immigration issues.
Even her sharpest critics conceded that she would not have intended any offence.
They said she had most likely used a phrase which was in common usage in a different decade.
Nonetheless, the Residents against Racism said they were deeply upset by the comments and found them "deeply offensive".
Spokesperson Rosanna Flynn called on her to apologise.
"I am really surprised at her. It is very offensive to a lot of people," she said. "It's a real gaffe."
Peter O'Mahoney, chief executive of the Irish Refugee Council, said: "The use of such language is ill advised."
But he added that Mrs O'Rourke was "one of a relatively small number of national politicians who are fairly brave on refugee issues".
Fine Gael's Jim O'Keeffe said it was not a wise way to express herself in this day and age.
Labour's Michael D Higgins said: "I don't think she had any insulting intention at all." But he added: "People have moved on and there is a language that we used before when people were not so well informed."
Senator O'Rourke's nephew, Junior Foreign Affairs Minister Conor Lenihan, was in a storm of controversy last May after his infamous "kebab" gaffe.
Mr Lenihan, a TD for Dublin South West, was forced to apologise for what was widely regarded as a jibe at Turkish workers during the course of a heated and hotly contested Dail debate. Mrs O'Rourke scraped through a tense selection convention by nine votes, defeating her sole opponent Cllr Kevin 'Boxer' Moran by 48 to 39.
They had both conducted a high-intensity campaign for weeks as they fought a tough struggle for the vital deciding votes.
The senator said after her victory that herself and Cllr Moran had conducted a "harmonious" campaign, adding: "Would you believe it!"
There was loud laughter and shouts of 'no' from some of the delegates who also groaned when she spoke of the hardcore of her helpers in the campaign working "like blacks".
In her victory speech, she spoke of Fianna Fail as "the Republican party", despite the claims of other parties in that regard.
The party's National Constituencies Committee had decided in advance of the convention that sitting TDs Peter Kelly, in the Longford area, and Donie Cassidy, in the northern end of the Westmeath district, would be put on the ticket unopposed.
This left the two Athlone candidates, Sen O'Rourke and Cllr Moran, in a straight contest to join them in the Dail race.
Mrs O'Rourke (68) has been itching to get back into the Dail after her sensational defeat in the 2002 general election in what was then the Westmeath constituency.
Mr Cassidy, himself then a senator, beat her for the second Fianna Fail seat after a bitter and bruising campaign which left a huge residue of anger in the O'Rourke camp.
Mrs O'Rourke's victory sets the scene for a battle royal between O'Rourke and Cassidy.
The House is more polarized than at any time in the last century, according to models built by Keith Poole, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, and Howard Rosenthal, professor emeritus of social sciences at Princeton. The last time the Senate was this divided, according to the joint research, was a century ago.

While Americans say they want an end to partisan bickering in Washington, Mr. Cooper said, they vote to maintain the system that has created it. “It's like Hollywood movies,” he said. “Most people say there is too much violence and sex, but those are the only tickets that sell.”
Representatives Larry Kissell of North Carolina, John Barrow of Georgia and Jim Matheson of Utah, all Blue Dogs, appear to be losing ground in their races for re-election. Because of redistricting, their constituencies have become less familiar with them, making them easier targets for outside groups that have been spending heavily on ads to unseat them. Their poll numbers have been dropping throughout this cycle.
Many other more moderate Democrats, including Representatives Dan Boren of Oklahoma and Mike Ross of Arkansas, and Senators Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chose to hand over their member pins rather than seek re-election.
In theory, the dearth of moderates means it will be even harder next year for Congress — which failed to put together even mundane measures like farm and highway legislation without a fight this session — to pass bills.
But Congress is facing so many potentially calamitous tax and budget issues that another theory is brewing: a combination of Democrats, once averse to changes to social welfare programs, and senior Republicans may form some sort of new deal-making consensus through sheer necessity to avoid large tax increases and significant military cuts.
“If Republicans think by embracing the Tea Party it is a loser politically,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat, “it may strengthen the hands of the mainstream conservatives” to make deals with the 10 or so moderate Democrats in the Senate who are interested in reforming Medicare and other programs.

Further, there is an emerging push on the Democratic side toward the center among many of their Senate candidates, like Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Tim Kaine in Virginia and Richard Carmona in Arizona, who all are running as pragmatic centrists willing to work with Republicans
Photo
For this to happen, according to moderates from both parties and several Congressional experts, the next president will have to make conciliation a top priority.
“The next president has to channel Lyndon Johnson and seize the levers of power and make Congress work,” said former Representative Jane Harman, a moderate Democrat from California, who resigned last year to become the director of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. “Obama talked about it and tried it briefly, but would sustain effort have helped with this Congress? I think so.”
The erosion of moderation in Congress started decades ago. The decennial Congressional redistricting, which has been done almost exclusively by state legislatures, has continued the creation of gerrymandered districts that keep competitive elections anomalies.

“Some candidates don't even have to wake up on Election Day to win,” Mr. LaTourette said. “I have not seen yet a redistricting proposal that is anything other than trying to favor one side over the other.”
Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor of California and a moderate Republican, devoted much of his political career to beating back partisanship through a redistricting process that was removed from the hands of legislators, and pushing a nonpartisan primary process in which the top two vote getters, regardless of parties, face off in general elections. This year, both came together in his state, after years of impediments thrown up by both parties.
“These are important steps that no one wanted to take,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said. “They said, ‘You can't touch that!' It is doable if you stay in there and work with good government groups, but you have to be aware that the parties will go after you.” He added, “Partisanship is the No. 1 enemy. We can't move forward on the most important things plaguing our country.”
Outside groups pour loads of money into targeting candidates, particularly incumbents who are seen as disloyal to party positions, and members are pressured by groups to vote against bills that slide outside the window of party orthodoxy. “If you're not 100 percent pure with that group or party, you're targeted,” Mr. Boren said.

Mr. Cooper and Mr. LaTourette recounted their extreme disappointment when they joined forces to bring a budget bill based on the recommendations of the deficit commission known as Bowles-Simpson to the House floor.

That day, both men said, they had at least 100 members from both parties with them; by the time of the evening vote, that number had been whittled to a mere 38. “Tons of people said really great things about it,” Mr. Cooper said, “but when the interest groups kicked in, they dramatically changed. One member told me his favorite lobbyist would be fired if he voted for it.”
President Obama's decision early in his presidency to allow the Democratic-controlled Congress to craft legislation like the health care law while he remained at arm's length did not help, members on both sides said. Neither did his lack of engagement with Republicans when they were in the minority, they said.
“Obama's biggest failing has been not reaching out to Congress,” said former Representative Mike Castle, a moderate Republican from Delaware who lost a Senate bid two years ago. “I remember being at a White House meeting with Rahm Emanuel with other moderate Republicans,” he said, referring to the former White House chief of staff, “and the president came out and spoke to us for about 30 minutes. It was a good conversation, mostly about Medicare. I don't know if anyone in that group ever heard from him again.”
Despite the increasing polarization, the “fiscal cliff” facing Congress at the end of the year, when a series of tax increase and steep budget cuts are set to automatically begin, may force some departing members to move more to the middle, simply because the implications are too grave.
The outcome of the presidential election will almost certainly have an impact on the political interplay of the next Congress. Should Mr. Obama prevail, said members and officials from leadership offices of both parties, many Democrats may feel more compelled to attack the problems with social programs. Also, many senior Republicans, once considered among the most conservative, may feel empowered to make deals to stave off large cuts to the military.
But then again, many, like Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, are facing re-election in 2014, and already feel heat from the right. Mr. McConnell, who once backed Senator Rand Paul's primary challenger in his home state, recently hired one of Mr. Paul's aides to run his campaign.

A US hacker who put the personal data of celebrities and officials online has been sentenced to two years in jail.
New Yorker Mir Islam also made bogus calls that resulted in armed police storming the homes of film stars, federal workers and public figures.
The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said the sentence reflected his involvement in many campaigns of online harassment.
Islam will serve one year in jail as he has been in federal custody for the past 12 months.
The names, birthdays, address, phone numbers and social security numbers of more than 50 people including First Lady Michelle Obama, FBI director Robert Mueller and CIA director John Brennan were posted by Islam to the Exposed.su website, said the DoJ.
The information was used by "countless others" to carry out a variety of finance-related frauds, said the DoJ, leaving many people suffering credit problems.
'I was invincible'
In addition to "doxing" public figures in this way, Islam also engaged in another malicious hacker tactic of "swatting", which involves making calls about bogus incidents that require armed police to investigate.
Many people, including actor Ashton Kutcher, music impresario Jay-Z and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, were "swatted" by Islam in this way.
"This crime not only diverted first responders from actual life-threatening emergencies and wasted their valuable time and resources, but it also caused severe emotional distress to a large number of victims," said US attorney John Leonardo.
In court, Islam defended himself, saying that at the time he carried out the attacks he was suffering from depression and a bipolar disorder.
"I didn't expect to go as far as I did, but because of these disorders I felt I was invincible," Islam is reported to have said in court. "The mistakes I made before, I have to pay for that. I understand that."
Court papers revealed that the doxing and swatting attacks were carried out while Islam was co-operating with the FBI after being arrested in 2012 for trying to buy and sell stolen credit cards.
Islam also made a fake bomb threat and cyberstalked a woman during his campaigns of harassment, said the DoJ.
An investigation into the other people he worked with when stealing data and exposing it online is continuing, said the FBI.

The Cubot S550 carries on the fingerprint trend but with a 5.5-inch screen and good looks to match
Update: Looking for the latest Cubot Phones? Top 5 Cubot Smartphones
The S550 is Cubot's second phone to feature a fingerprint sensor. The first from Cubot being the S600, which in terms of specifications is very similar but with a slightly smaller screen. I'm not a huge fan of the design of the Cubot S600 so I'm glad to see the S550 hasn't gone down the same route, but it's not all about good looks.
First impressions of the S550 are good, I like the simple and understated design allowing the screen to take centre stage. Physically it has the same 1.3GHz quad-core CPU, Mali-T720 GPU, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and internal sensors as the S600, so let us take a closer look at what separates the Cubot S550 from the pack and see how it compares to the ever-growing choice of Cubot phones available.
Cubot S550 starts at… UK : £114.99 | EU : €145.99 | US : $149.99
Let's start off with the Pro's and Con's of the Cubot S550 and then explore in more detail the Design, Screen, Hardware, Battery, Camera & Connectivity.
Pro's
Large Bright Display
fingerprint Sensor
Simple Design
Dual SIM
Decent Battery
Con's
No dedicated SD Slot
Not Full HD
Screen & Design
The S550 comes with a 5.5-inch IPS screen with a resolution of 1280×720 pixels giving it a PPI of 267. This isn't going to blow your socks off in amazement but the screen is bright and clear. Viewing angles appear okay but blacks lose their darkness a little when not viewed straight on, I don't know anyone who prefers looking at their phone sideways… so not a problem for me.
As with most Chinese phones, there is a black border around the screen that only appears when the phone screen is on. Luckily the border on the S550 isn't too big and you can hide this effect somewhat if you choose the black model. But why would you want the black version when the gold S550 looks awesome!
The phone features a metal frame with the volume rocker and lock button on one side, headphone jack on top and micro-USB on the bottom. The whole phone has a very minimal look that works well.
Colours Available: Gold, Black & Gold
Screen Tech Specs: 5.5 Inch,IPS OGS, 1280×720, 267PPI, Capacitive, 2.5D
Software
Cubot always does a good job of keeping their phones bloatware free and the S550 is no exception. The S550 is pre-installed with Android Lollipop 5.1 right out of the box. Customisable software features on the Cubot S550 are custom touch gestures, Fingerprint sensor management, and Fingerprint actions.
Hardware
The Cubot S550 comes with a pretty average splattering of hardware, but we're talking about a budget phone here so ‘average' is a good thing.
CPU
Powering the brains behind the S550 is MediaTek's MT6735A, which runs at 1.3GHz on 4 cores. It's a popular CPU choice in low-mid range china phones and performs most tasks quickly providing a fluid interface for Android Lollipop.
GPU – Gaming Performance
The Cubot S550 also performed solidly in gaming benchmarks with its Mali-T720 graphics processing unit.
In the AnTuTu Benchmark, the Cubot S550 scored 32084:
3D : 2916
UX : 13162
CPU : 11764
RAM : 4242
RAM
It's nice to see 2GB of RAM as this is plenty for mid-range phones.
Internal Storage
Unlike the S600 which has a double-sided SIM tray with a dedicated SD slot the S550 is either Dual SIM or Single SIM + SD Card. This isn't all bad as it comes with 16GB of internal storage as standard which is plenty for most people. The phone does support OTG so you can attach external media the device to bump up that storage capacity when needed.
Tech Specs: MT6735A CPU 4-Core 1.3GHz, 64bit, Mali-T720 GPU, 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage, 32GB expandable
Battery
Keeping your S550 running throughout the day won't be too difficult as Cubot has placed a respectable 3000mAh battery inside. This is non-removable but I'll update with just how easy the battery would be to replace soon. Cubot have started stocking batteries and screens on their website so hopefully this will only expand as the manufacturer become increasingly popular.
Camera
Cubot have gone with the OmniVision OV8865 which is a 13 Megapixel (8MP interpolated) autofocus CMOS sensor. I've just got the tech specs for now but I'll update with pictures soon.

It's hard to get away from Toronto's colonial British history with so many streets and statues named after places in the mother country. Our still-reluctant parting with the Queen was done through gradual and friendly legislation, rather than war, so no efforts were made to eradicate Toronto of its Britishness. We even accepted a King Edward VII statue from Delhi when India was doing its post-colonial purge. Located in the middle of Queen's Park since 1969, Edward and his horse are even getting a renovation right now.

Less formal cross-Atlantic connections are the proliferation of pubs throughout the Toronto area. Different from bars, there's an emphasis on food that follows in the “Public House” tradition, though Ontario's Prohibition-era liquor laws require food be sold with alcohol. Sometimes the pubs are Irish-inspired, and though Ireland was no colonial superpower, it spawned outposts across the city similar to the Tara Inn, a pub found in a Scarborough strip mall along Eglinton Ave. E. “Come share a taste of Ireland,” the sign says. It's just one stop on a tour of nations in this multicultural plaza and as it's open late, the Tara keeps the strip lively after other shops have closed.

Downtown on Elm St., The Queen and Beaver, with a name that pokes a bit of fun at Canada's Anglophilia, is a high styled pub with a Union Jack and pictures of the first Queen Elizabeth. Just up Yonge St. on Isabella St., the Artful Dodger appropriately inhabits an entire Victorian duplex and has working gas fireplaces. Further north, the Rebel House by Rosedale subway forgoes Britain by recalling local history with its Rebellions of 1837 references. The most comfortable pubs aren't dives, but worn in like the leather seats in an old sports car or an aged club chair. There's no fuss to enter or leave. Good pubs are a kind of public living room, what urban theorists call a “third space,” not home or work but a place where public life happens. You can go alone, to read or work on a laptop, but also to talk to other people. There's a looseness inside pubs that cracks Toronto's legendary reserve. Everybody doesn't need to necessarily know your name in a pub, but it's the low-key friendliness that makes these essential parts of our city, with bartenders serving as amateur therapists of sorts, sucking up stories the way pub carpet absorbs spilled beer. Pubs tend never to be the “it” places, rather they're institutions that rarely change with the times. Out of fashion, they're sometimes derided for being “fake,” imitation British or Irish pubs, but aren't most places we go to a reference to somewhere or something else? Is a knock-off painting of a fox hunt any different than a café that uses reclaimed wood and exposed brick walls that allude to an rougher, industrial past that few of us actually experience?
I've a soft spot for local chain pubs like the Firkins. With names like the Churchmouse and Firkin, the Flatiron and Firkin, and the Squire and Firkin, there should be one called the Firkin and Various and Sundry. They are the Starbucks of pubs, each familiar but different. Satellite radio will play the hit songs; CP24 will be in silent rotation on plasma screens, and a broad cross-section of people will be inside. There's no worry if the scene isn't my scene because they're as every-scene as late-evening Toronto gets. Our pubs are a public living room whenever we need them.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he would allow Jewish settlers evicted by the Israeli army from two houses in the West Bank city of Hebron to return once proper permits were in place.
Israeli settlements in occupied territory, deemed illegal by most countries, are a fundamental issue in the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace process and a factor behind a recent wave of Palestinian stabbing attacks on Israelis.
About 80 settlers were removed from Hebron on Friday a day after Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon withheld his required approval of their occupancy in apartments in a city where tensions between Israelis and Palestinians run high.
The settler group said it had bought the homes from Palestinian owners. But Yaalon said the settlers had failed to seek permission from Israeli authorities to move in and were trespassing.
A Netanyahu aide said on Friday that the prime minister supported Yaalon's decision to evict the settlers, a step that drew criticism from members of the right-wing coalition government and threats to withhold support in parliamentary votes.
But the aide said the settlers could take up residency again after completing the necessary paperwork.
In public remarks at the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu said his government “supports the settlements” and would expedite an examination of the settlers' case.
“The moment that the purchase process is authorised, we will allow the population of the two houses in Hebron,” Netanyahu said, confirming his aide's remarks.
Officials say a $1.2 million project to renovate Shiprock High's natatorium is nearly done
Buy Photo New flooring and pool lights are among the renovations crews completed at the pool facility at Shiprock High School. (Photo: Steve Lewis/The Daily Times)Buy Photo Story Highlights Most of the repairs were to the pool's facility, though crews also installed new lighting in the pool.
Renovations include a new roof, doors, heating and AC units and restroom fixtures, as well as a new outdoor picnic area.
A new party room was also added to the facility for the community to rent for various events.
The pool is used both by CCSD students and patients from the Northern Navajo Medical Center.
SHIPROCK — Central Consolidated School District officials believe a $1.2 million project to renovate the facility that houses Shiprock High School's swimming pool will create a more inviting building.
Last week, crews with B&M Cillessen Construction Co., a Farmington-based contractor, were applying the finishing touches to the natatorium, the building that contains the pool.
Most of the renovation focused on the 25-year-old building. Crews also made one minor improvement to the 152,000-gallon pool itself, which was resurfaced about five years ago, according to Waynette Danley, the district's building and construction specialist. New lighting was installed in the pool while it was drained.
“I think the project is going pretty well,” Danley said.
The pool is primarily used for educational and medical purposes, according to CCSD spokesman James Preminger. He said CCSD students use the pool, as do patients from Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock. About 10 to 12 patients a day use the pool and hot tub for physical therapy, Preminger said.
One addition was added to the building during the renovation. Members of the community will soon be able to rent a new party room near the pool for various events.

During a tour of the facility, Thomas Montanez, a superintendent at B&M Cillessen Construction, said all of the old fixtures in the men's and women's restrooms were replaced. Crews also installed new fixtures, including wall tiles, shower heads, flooring, toilets and shower stalls in each restroom.
Translucent panels were installed in each restroom to allow in natural light and brighten the interior. LED lighting fixtures throughout the facility also help liven up the building, according to Danley.
“It was dark, it wasn't inviting,” Danley said of the old building. “This is inviting.”

A new roof was installed, and heating and air conditioning units on the roof were replaced. Also as part of the renovations, the fire alarm system was replaced.
Montanez said the metal-framed doors in the building were rusting, and they have since been replaced with fiberglass doors.

A rubberized, slip-resistant coating was also hand-applied to the concrete floor on the deck around the pool to prevent visitors from slipping.
New roll doors were installed and painted to allow access to a new outdoor picnic area on the south side of the building.
Six new metal picnic tables have also been installed outside, underneath canopies. Landscaping, including trees and plants, was also completed.
New security fencing was also built around the building, and the multi-color block exterior was stained to be one color.

This weekend, a conservative group claimed taxpayers were getting scammed on Chevy Volt tax credits by dealers, proving the Volt wasn't nearly as popular as General Motors or the Obama administration says. Sorry to disappoint Rush Limbaugh, but they're wrong.
The National Legal and Policy Center's Mark Modica made some waves with this piece, contending Chevy dealers are selling the Volt to other dealers as used cars so they can take the $7,500 federal tax credit themselves. This, he said, was the fault of General Motors and President Barack Obama, who desire "to do everything in their power to support the appearance of strong Chevy Volt sales."
The story was then picked up by a number of outlets, none of whom did much in the way of vetting of the source. And in this case, it's fair to question it. The National Legal and Policy Center is one of a number of groups which criticizes the Obama administration for a living. Funded in part by right-wing activist Richard Mellon Scaife, nearly all of its stories target Democrats in some fashion, and the Volt piece was part of the site's "union corruption update" series.
OK, fine. What about the big charge that Chevy dealers are scamming a federal tax credit? Based on our research, it's highly unlikely — but if so, it's at a level that's a rounding error in the new-car business. And it would prove that the Volt is a hit.
Advertisement
Cars.com lists 18 used Volts for sale nationwide, compared to 603 new ones. Several of the used Volts are in far-flung states where GM has yet to officially put the Volt on sale, suggesting those dealers bought one as a demo driver or showroom showoff. Only one dealer — Glendale Hyundai in Glendale, Calif. — has more than one.
Glendale's stash of four used Volts is the only firm evidence Modica has of shenanigans. He says the dealership told him the cars were rentals, even though they only have 30 miles on them, and that it "raises the question of why GM or Chevy dealerships would be selling Volts to other manufacturers' dealerships when they claim that there are not enough of the cars to meet retail demand."

Yet GM doesn't control what a dealer does with a car once it leaves the factory, which is when the ownership officially transfers from the automaker. Dealers are free to mark up, discount or swap vehicles as they please; GM can browbeat or reprimand them on future orders — but it has no more control over a dealer selling Volts to another than it does to the Florida dealer asking $64,988 for a new one.
And while Modica wants to argue that swapped Volts show how GM and the Obama administration has failed, such a play by the dealers only works if there's more Volt demand than supply. Of the 13 Volts listed for sale with prices, the lowest is Glendale's four at $39,995. The average price of the 603 new Volts is about $41,000 — roughly the window sticker. Those new Volts not only qualify buyers for the $7,500 federal tax break, but also carry a raft of state and even local incentives that can save the buyer more money.
If demand for the Volt was as slack as Modica wants it to be, the used Volts should be discounted well below sticker to make up for the tax credits that are already spoken for. But with 493 Volts sold in April, and the Detroit factory closing this month while GM readies to boost production, all signs indicate a shortage of Volts. The fact is no one in America is selling a new Volt below sticker — and no dealer appears to be hawking used ones while soaking up federal tax benefits and betting against the Volt's popularity.

The NPLC's political blinders missed the Nissan Leaf, the only other mass-market vehicle that qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. It too has been in short supply; Nissan can't say when it will fill the 20,000 U.S. orders it has for the car, and there are only 82 new Leafs for sale nationwide according to Cars.com. Yet there are three used ones available — two of which are located at Glendale Hyundai. Glendale's asking price for its Leafs: $45,000, or roughly $12,000 more than sticker.
It's also strange for the NPLC to complain that GM and the Obama administration don't have enough control over auto dealers after opposing not just the GM and Chrysler bailouts that cut hundreds of dealers, but the financial reform bill that would have put auto dealers under tougher federal regulation. (Dealers won an exemption in Congress over the administration's objections). It's just what happens when you're in the business of making noise rather than sense.
By William Murchison - January 13, 2013
Forty-odd (exceedingly odd, I might add) years ago, who would have envisioned a national war against drugs? Nobody took drugs -- nobody you knew, nobody but jazz musicians and funny foreign folk. Then, after a while, it came to seem that everybody did. Drugs became a new front in the war on an old social culture that was taking hard licks aplenty in those days.
I still don't understand why people take drugs. Can't they just pour themselves a nice shot of bourbon? On the other hand, as Gary S. Becker and Kevin M. Murphy argue, in a lucid piece for the Wall Street Journal's Review section, prison populations have quintupled since 1980, in large degree thanks to laws meant to decrease drug usage by prohibiting it; 50,000 Mexicans may have died since 2006 in their country's war against traffickers, and addiction has probably increased.
Becker, a Nobel laureate in economics, and Murphy, a University of Chicago colleague, argue for putting decriminalization of drugs on the table for national consideration. The federal war on drugs, which commenced in 1971, was supposed to discourage use by punishing the sale and consumption of drugs. It hasn't worked quite that way.
"[T]he harder governments push the fight," the two argue, "the higher drug prices become to compensate the greater risks. That leads to larger profits for traffickers who avoid being punished." It can likewise lead "dealers to respond with higher levels of violence and corruption." In the meantime, Becker and Murphy point out, various states have decriminalized marijuana use or softened enforcement of existing prohibitions. Barely two months ago, voters in Colorado and Washington made their own jurisdictions hospitable to the friendly consumption of a joint.
The two economists say full decriminalization of drugs would, among other things, "lower drug prices, reduce the role of criminals in producing and selling drugs, improve many inner-city neighborhoods, [and] encourage more minority students in the U.S. to finish high school." To the Journal's question, "Have we lost the war on drugs?" 89.8 percent of readers replied, "Yes."
One isn't deeply surprised to hear it. National tides seem presently to be running in favor of abortion and gay marriage -- two more elements of the culture wars that began, contemporaneously, with the battle for the right to puff pot. Swimming against powerful tides is no politician's idea of a participatory sport. Conceivably, armed with practical (i.e., $$$$$$) reasons for decriminalizing drugs, advocates of such a policy course will prevail. We can then sit around wondering what all the fuss was about.
What it was about -- you had to have been there to remember now -- was the defense of cultural inhibitions. Sounds awful, doesn't it?
As the counterculture saw things, inhibitions -- voluntary, self-imposed restraints -- dammed up self-expression, self-realization. They dammed up a lot more than that, in truth: much of it in serious need of restraint and prevention.
The old pre-1960s culture assigned a higher role to the head than to the heart. Veneration of instincts risked the overthrow of social guardrails that inhibited bad, harmful and anti-social impulses. The drug culture that began in the '60s elevated to general popularity various practices, modes, devices, and so forth that moved instinct -- bad or good, who cared? -- to the top of the scale of values. There was a recklessness about the enterprise -- do whatever turns you on, man! -- incompatible with sober thought: which was fine with an era that had had it, frankly, with sober thought.
Drugs are very much a part of our time and culture, which is why the war on drugs looks more and more like a losing proposition. The point compellingly advanced by Becker and Murphy may win out over the next decade. If so, the drug gangs may disappear, the prisons disgorge tens of thousands. Will things in general be as good as they might have been had the culture walked a different path 40 years ago -- the path of civilized "inhibition"? Ah. We get down here to brass tacks.
Image copyright AP Image caption The Supreme Court ruled that the settlement of Amona was illegal
Residents of a Jewish outpost in the occupied West Bank have agreed to evacuate the area just one week before the deadline for eviction.
The community of Amona accepted a government relocation proposal with 45 votes in favour and 29 against.
Sunday's decision comes after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Supreme Court earlier ruled that the homes were built on private Palestinian land.
Families living at the unauthorised site, or outpost, were ordered to leave the area in the northern West Bank by 25 December.
Messages posted on Twitter by representatives of the Amona community said the decision to accept the government proposal was "not an easy one".
"We can definitely say that this decision was the most difficult one we ever took," one tweet reads, while another adds: "All who voted FOR did that with a heavy heart."
Image copyright AP Image caption Members of the Amona community said the decision was "the most difficult we ever took"
PM Netanyahu said the government had "done the maximum" to find a solution for the residents of Amona after an earlier proposal was rejected last week.
"Until dawn this morning we made very great efforts to reach an agreed solution on Amona," he told ministers at a cabinet meeting.
Anyone who remained at the site after the 25 December deadline faced a forced eviction.
The latest proposal involves moving 24 of the 40 families living in Amona to new adjacent plots not covered by the Supreme Court ruling, local media report.
Mr Netanyahu needs to ask the court for a stay of execution before the new plan is implemented.
The issue of how to deal with the Amona site has caused tension within Israel's right-wing coalition government, with some members opposed to its removal.
According to the anti-settlement movement Peace Now, there are 97 outposts in the occupied West Bank, and over 130 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Unlike officially recognised settlements, the government regards outposts as illegal.

It was announced just a few days ago that Bob Weir was going to join Phil Lesh for a very special edition of “Songs to Phil the Air” in the backyard at Terrapin Crossroads. While Bobby had joined Phil just a couple of months ago to celebrate Terrapin Crossroad's 5th anniversary , it's always a treat when the two founding members of the Grateful Dead reunite on stage.The lineup for yesterday's early evening performance included Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, Grahame Lesh, Jason Crosby & Scott Law. What was missing from the usual gang of friends was a drummer. The performance is very similar to the gorgeous set that Holly Bowling did with Phil last year. While some critics will be turned off by the absence of a drummer right from the start, these lineups a rarity and definitely worth a listen.In addition to the beautiful cover of The Beatles' “Dear Prudence,” Phil, Bobby and friends performed “The Wheel” and “Cassidy” among other Dead classics.The WheelCassidyThanks to nowiknowuryder and billzlose for the great footage!Photo credit: drumzspace
Becky Lynch loves good puns and, well, if you follow her on social media, you know she likes really bad puns, too.
Sightseeing trips on the road are often referred to as “Bexcellent Adventures.” Lynch has held up a container of yogurt to describe an opponent as having “gurt” feelings and a chair to explain her actions as “un-chair-itable.” A nearly 14-minute Instagram video of Lynch struggling to open a tin pineapple can with a manual can opener has been viewed nearly 300,000 times and has plenty of puns.
“I just love making puns. I love words and I love word play,” she said. “I find them hilarious. Me and my friends since we were teenagers, we'd talk in different puns. I incorporated them into my Instagram game and my Twitter game.
“They haven't really come on to TV that much. It's separate from my character and what I do and being Becky Lynch. The puns are more me being Rebecca Quin.”
WWE fans have seen glimpses of Lynch's sense of humor. She hopes more is coming, but only when the time is right.
Lynch, the first woman drafted to Smackdown Live last summer and the brand's inaugural women's champion, has joined forces with current champion Naomi and Charlotte Flair against the “Welcoming Committee” of Natalya, Carmella and Tamina. The two sides will square off in a six-person tag team match Sunday at WWE Backlash (8 p.m. ET on WWE Network).
“It will come in time,” Lynch told For The Win of adding more comedy. “Right now, my character needs an element of more intensity instead of a comedy role, although I would love, for example, to team up with Breezango and do something on the Fashion Files. That is one of my favorite segments on Smackdown Live now.
“With the Becky Lynch character, there are so many different elements we haven't seen yet. I've been a similar storyline in the last year and a half or two years. Hopefully, it's not going to end with Charlotte turning on me again, but oh dear, if that's what it is, I will a lot smarter to it and then we'll see an extra edge to my character.”
Following Flair's move from Monday Night RAW to Smackdown Live in the recent Superstar Shakeup, both women have talked about rekindling their longtime feud. Their 2016 match at the Royal Rumble was one of the key benchmarks in WWE's women's revolution with Flair retaining the title over Lynch and Sasha Banks then coming to the ring to attack Lynch. The three then worked a triple threat title match at WrestleMania 32 in Dallas.
Flair has been clear about her intention to go after Naomi for the title so the current storyline could lead to Flair vs. Naomi and then Flair vs. Lynch.
“This gives it a longevity to where we can go,” Lynch said. “If we start fighting right now, there's not really anywhere we can go. If we can team up and be on the same page, there are a multitude of directions we can go.
“Eventually, I'd like to face her for a championship down the line. Hopefully, it will be me with the championship. I've never gotten to face her in a fair fight. She's always had someone in her corner, whether it was Ric or Dana Brooke so it will be interesting to see how that will go. She's here and on her own and going solo.”
On a personal level, though, Flair's move to Smackdown has allowed she and best friend Lynch to travel together as opposed to only seeing each other when the brands interact.
“It's been absolutely great. It's wonderful to have her over here,” she said. “The Smackdown Live locker room is the best ever. It's just an amazing camaraderie across the board and Charlotte really adds an extra element to the locker room. She's such a hard worker. Everybody will have to stay on their game.”
Lynch spoke to For The Win about singles vs. tag team matches, adding more mixed martial arts to her performance, Totals Divas, turning 30 and more:
You find yourself in a six-person tag team match at Backlash. Do you prefer singles or tag matches?
I generally prefer singles matches or multi-person matches like four-ways or triple threats or six-pack challenges, but there's always a challenge with tag team matches with doing a different formula for people to worry about. If I had the choice, I'd rather worry about myself. I was never a team sport player so I think that lends itself to why I prefer singles matches.
James Ellsworth has been an interesting addition to this six-man tag situation. I believe you called him a cross between E.T. and a thumb the other day and been clear that you could take him. What he has added?
I think it's been brilliant. He adds an extra layer of entertainment. He's been crucial in helping move this storyline along. But I would love personally nothing more than to drop the head off him and Beckplex him into a different town.
There has been some speculation about casting changes for Total Divas. I've seen a few reports suggesting that you could be involved. Is that something you'd be interested in?
Honestly, you're the first person that's said that to me. I haven't heard anything about that. … I think there's a certain – not a whole lot – but a certain amount of mystery of me that I don't really envision that as the best option for me to take part in. It's a tremendous opportunity for those that do it, I just don't know that it's my thing. When I envisioned my life as a little girl, that was never in my horizons. I'm going to stay with what I want in the future. I don't see that being reality TV.
Most people know you are dating UFC fighter Luke Sanders. In fact, he said that he HIT THE “Girlfriend Lottery” with you. He also has said that the two of you are in the gym and working on moves. How does what he does translate to what you do?
He's such a sweetheart, just the best. … (laughs)
(As far as working out), he's so great about taking the time to show me things. I'll ask and he'll come up with ideas. The spinning back kick that I've started using in a lot of my matches is something he showed me. There is a bunch of stuff that he showed me in the gym the other day that I haven't incorporated yet, but it's so good to be able to bring a different freshness into the ring.
You recently turned 30 and have been wrestling since you were 15. How did you deal with an age with a zero on the end?
That was a tough one for me. When you're a little kid, you think when I'm 30, I'm going to have this and do that. I think when I was a kid, I thought I was going to have five kids by 30. I have none. I think the way my life has turned out has been pretty darn good and I couldn't imagine it any better at the moment. I think that's a better way of measuring as opposed to what you thought you'd be when you were younger and you didn't have a clue.
I don't think I've enjoyed a birthday since I turned 19. When I was 19, I thought this is great. Then it was like, “Darn, I'm not 19 anymore.” I kinda wanted to get it out of my head that I'm getting older. In the end, though, it doesn't make a difference really.

ITAMI'S BIG MOMENT
Among the performers with the most at stake this weekend is Hideo Itami, who challenges Booby Roode for the NXT championship at NXT TakeOver: Chicago on Saturday (8 p.m. ET, WWE Network).
Itami signed to WWE in 2014 after a stellar run in Japan with Pro Wrestling Noah. He needed shoulder surgery in May 2015 and missed more than a year. Four months later, he had a neck injury and was out for an extended period.
“He's kind of had a stutter-stop in his carer and watched a lot of guys come in and make a name for themselves while he's had setback after setback,” said Paul “Triple H” Levesque, WWE's executive vice president of talent, live events and creative. “I'm looking for him to make a statement and getting himself to move in a positive direction.”
“He's gone through a difficult time when leave someplace where you are a big star and a well known and come here and are presented in a big way. Some talent comes in and struggles with their footing and some don't, whether it's a confidence issue or trying to get comfortable in their new environment. … He's a big player and I think he will rise to the occasion because that's what big players do.”
Tomasso Ciampa of DIY suffered an ankle injury during a live event Thursday night that led to the match being stopped. DIY is scheduled to challenge NXT tag team champions the Authors of Pain in a ladder match at TakeOver. Levesque said X-rays showed no break and that Ciampa is being evaluated by the medical staff.
“When I texted with him this morning, he was feeling better and was up moving around,” Levesque said. “He felt he would not have an issue with it. As of right now, he's in, but we'll see where that goes.”
Adam Cole's ROH sendoff
Great scene in Philadelphia on Sunday night as Ring of Honor gave three-time world champion Adam Cole a sendoff following his last scheduled appearance for the company. Many expect Cole to be bound for WWE, although he is continuing to work independent dates while he determines his future. When it was over, the crowd chanted, “We will miss you” and called for Cole to make a speech.
“The love and respect that all of you have shown me is the reason that I can stand here before you as nine years a pro wrestler, three times a world champion and having traveled the globe because you guys thought I was good enough,” he said. “No matter what happens, I want each and every one of you to know that I love you and Ring of Honor will always be in my heart.”
Among those in the crowd were Cole's mother and her boyfriend and his younger brother Brent, who noted the night was like “coming full circle.” Adam and Brent used to travel to the same arena in Philadelphia as teenagers long before Adam became a pro wrestler to watch Combat Zone Wrestling and other promotions that ran the arena.
Tropical forests emit more carbon each year than all of the cars and trucks in the United States, scientists said on Thursday, calling for greater efforts to stem forest loss and damage.
Almost 70 per cent of tropical forest emissions are caused by degradation, a study in the journal Science said, measuring the less visible form of damage for the first time along with deforestation, which has long been recognized as problematic.
"These findings provide the world with a wake-up call on forests," said the study's lead author, Alessandro Baccini, a scientist with the U.S.-based Woods Hole Research Center, in a statement.
"If we're to keep global temperatures from rising to dangerous levels, we need to drastically reduce emissions and greatly increase forests' ability to absorb and store carbon."
Tropical forests play a key role in combating global warming, as they absorb carbon during photosynthesis. But they emit carbon when they burn or decay after dying.
'If we're to keep global temperatures from rising to dangerous levels, we need to drastically reduce emissions and greatly increase forests' ability to absorb and store carbon,' said the study's lead author. (Ulises Rodriguez/Reuters)
Deforestation accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of carbon emissions worldwide. It is doubly damaging as decomposing trees produce carbon and are no longer able to store it, Baccini told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
"Throughout the tropics you have selective logging, or smallholder farmers removing individual trees for fuel wood," Wayne Walker, another of the authors, said in a statement. "These losses can be relatively small in any one place, but added up across large areas they become considerable."
Carbon losses from deforestation and forest degradation exceed gains on every continent, said the study, produced using 12 years of satellite imagery and field measurements.
Latin America, home to the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, was responsible for nearly 60 per cent of carbon losses, followed by Africa at 24 percent, it said.

An elderly man was pronounced dead at the scene after suffering from a medical episode and crashing into a block of flats on Out Risbygate yesterday morning, with a female passenger also injured.
Just minutes after his death two girls believed to be in their teens approached the cordon, passing dozens of emergency vehicles, and took a posed photo on a phone.
One teen then stood with arms outstretched in a ‘jazz hands' pose in front of the cordon, with a smile plastered across her face, while her friend took the picture. Metres away a man was laying dead on the pavement behind a fire engine.
The ‘crash scene selfie' was met with anger by Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore, while officers at the scene said incidents like this were becoming more and more common.

“I am absolutely astounded to hear that people can behave in this manner,” said Mr Passmore. “When you have a road accident, regardless of whether there is a fatality, this sort of behaviour is completely despicable.
“My condolences of course go out to the friends and family of the bereaved. To think that people can act with such a crass approach to this tragedy?
“Making fun of a road collision? It beggars belief. It shows a complete lack of respect and can cause great distress.
“I would hope that if they read the headlines they will be remorseful and not behave like this in the future. Hopefully this will be a lesson to anyone else out there who thinks this is an okay way to behave. How would they feel if it was their brother or their family member in an accident?”
The crash happened near to the junction with Spring Lane, with emergency services called just before 10.30am. An air ambulance attended, landing at nearby West Suffolk College.
It is not known if the two girls attend the college but deputy principal Martyn Wagner condemned their actions. He said: “We certainly don't condone this behaviour and we hope our students were not involved. We are dreadfully sorry to hear about the accident and our thoughts are with those involved and their families.”
The incident happened just before 10.30am, when the silver people carrier careered across the pavement, through a low garden wall and into the front of Lund Court. The passenger, an elderly lady, is not thought to be seriously injured but was taken to West Suffolk Hospital.
The driver is believed to have suffered a medical episode, and despite residents in the flats rushing to his aid, was pronounced dead by paramedics.
Piotr Perz, who lives on the third floor of Lund Court, described what happened. He said: “I was laying on the sofa when I heard a really loud bang.
“I jumped up to look outside and saw the car and just rushed downstairs. I helped to pull him out and then the car caught fire.
“I ran inside and made sure everyone got out in case the fire caught. I know the man died; it is very sad. The lady was badly hurt.”
The fire service were initially called to reports of the car being on fire – however it was not alight on arrival.
The road between Spring Lane and Westley Road remained closed for several hours, but reopened yesterday afternoon. Firefighters were assessing the structure of the building yesterday to ensure it was not at danger of collapse.
Any witnesses are asked to contact the Serious Collision Investigation Team on 101 quoting reference CAD 102 of March 21.
Analysis by vehicle tracking firm Satrak ranked Wolverhampton fifth worst for the average driving speed, with motorists travelling at 14.79mph.
It follows the announcement of an upcoming 18-month swathe of roadworks on the A449 last week.
Conservative group leader Wendy Thompson has urged bosses to rethink proposals for the scheme between Junction 2 of the M54, at Fordhouses, and Springfield Lane.
Bosses had described them as 'short-term pain for long-term gain'.
But Councillor Thompson has accused the authority's Labour leadership of clogging up routes into the city which are vital for both workers and shoppers - and costing businesses cash.
However, Labour cabinet member Milkinder Jaspal responded to her claims by saying she was 'talking nonsense'.
Councillor Thompson said: "I can't believe the amount of roadworks that are going on at the moment.
"The amount of time some of them are taking is absolutely incredible.

"The cost for businesses must be enormous and the frustration for drivers as well.
"I really find it inexplicable that all these roadworks are coming - it's utterly appalling.
"It is a war against motorists. We know roadworks need doing and development needs to take place.
"But all this work gives the impression of a lack of co-ordination and a lack of sympathy for motorists."
Advertising
The aim of the newly-announced project is to improve access to i54, the Wolverhampton Business Park, and the Junction 2 employment area.
It is expected to be funded by the Black Country Local Enterprise Partnership 'Local Growth Fund'.
Earlier this month work began in Newhampton Road West, Wolverhampton, to replace more than 1km of iron gas mains.
Other works are ongoing further south on the Stafford Road, in Wolverhampton city centre on Pipers Row, and on the Birmingham New Road near Coseley.
Councillor Jaspal said: "Saying we are waging war against motorists is a load of rubbish.
"We're making constant improvements to the roads and a lot of roadworks are also being done by utility companies and they are urgent work that needs to be done.
"Saying it is a war against motorists is a load of nonsense - if we don't do the repairs and maintenance then they will end up in a worse state.
"As I have said before if we do not do work to maintain the roads then we will just get more claims from people.
"But if we do the works then people get can stick in traffic jams."
Cambridge was ranked the slowest city in the UK in the figures, with average speeds of 13.73mph.
When the new A449 roadworks were revealed, Councillor Steve Evans, Wolverhampton council's cabinet member for city environment, said: "Our highways improvements programme is making a big difference to the transport network in the City of Wolverhampton.
"The Stafford Road Area Action Plan (AAP) and the emerging South Staffordshire Site Allocation Document (SAD) present significant opportunities for improved and additional employment land along the A449 corridor and to the north of the city, including the next phase of development at i54.
"It is vitally important the road network matches those ambitions and supports businesses and jobs growth in the area.
"We are working closely with businesses and residents to ensure we deliver a scheme that benefits everyone and, as always, we will aim to minimise disruption."

Attempts at controlling lives through over-regulation were arguably more glaring than ever in 2013. Here are the top 5 over-the-top bans/ban proposals this year.
(1) A proposed ban on news racks in Clark County, Nevada. Yes, news racks! The justification for this proposal was based on an effort to clean up the sidewalks. I guess those dining and shopping guides are a real obstruction and threat to our sidewalks? It is amazing how virtually every city in the country functions perfectly fine with those dangerous news racks.
(2) San Francisco city supervisor David Chiu introduced a proposal to ban water bottles. Wait, I thought water was healthy and good for you? I guess the water is good, but the bottles aren't? The proposal would ban “the sale of plastic water bottles at any events on public land with more than 100 people and prevent the city from spending any public money on bottled water.” San Francisco is not the only one attempting to control the distribution of water bottles. Early in the year, a Massachusetts town banned water bottles.
(3) The war on plastic does not end there. The San Diego city counsel proposed a ban to remove plastic bags from stores while imposing a paper bag tax on customers. Even though plastic bags reportedly make up only one-third of one percent of the waste stream, the ban was designed to reduce environmental waste.
(4) Claiming that violent video games “play a role” in violent behavior, a state lawmaker in New Jersey introduced legislation to prohibit amusement parks, movie theaters, bowling allies, or restaurants from having violent video games. Under the proposed legislation, business owners could face fines of up to $10,000 for the first offense and $20,000 for repeated offenses. Perhaps this lawmaker missed the 2011 Supreme Court case that found in a 7-2 decision that games, like other forms of media, were protected speech under the First Amendment. But hey, since when should the constitution get in the way?
(5) This one takes the cake. The Los Angeles City Council is considering a ban on feeding homeless people in public areas. Passing laws against aggressive panhandling, sleeping in restricted areas, and other specific homeless acts that could be considered nuisance or even criminal make sense, but preventing people from feeding the homeless is outlandish. It is an effort that legislates against charitable feeding, much of it performed by faith-based organizations.
There you have it. In 2013, overzealous regulators pushed laws to ban news racks, water bottles, plastic bags, video games, feeding the homeless, and more!

Mercy In a Mean Time
Brian Zahnd
My father was a political man; a lawyer and a judge. He was an ideological conservative. He was also known for his kindness and mercy. My dad died in 2009. At his funeral a man approached me and said, “Your father sent me to prison for armed robbery. I came to his funeral today to honor him. He always treated me with respect and dignity, and he dealt with me as mercifully as the law would allow.” I don't know how often a felon attends the funeral of a judge who sent him to prison in order to pay his respects, but I would guess it's not too often. My point is that my father was a political conservative who never felt his conservatism was in conflict with his Christian commitment to kindness and mercy.
Which is why I am so baffled and grieved by what seems to be a turn toward meanness in the name of conservatism. I'm also quite sure that my father, were he alive today, would be just as baffled and grieved.
But as a pastor my real concern is for Christians who embrace meanness simply because they see it modeled by culture war celebrities like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter. This is a tragedy. Philosophically I have no intrinsic objection to ideological conservatism. (Personally, I don't bother to place myself anywhere on the Left/Right political grid.) But for followers of Jesus the manner in which we hold our politics must be compatible with the spirit of Jesus. And, yes, I know very well that ideological liberalism can be just as mean and intolerant. But my concern is for the community of evangelicals with whom I have been deeply associated for more than forty years. Many American evangelicals now seem to be infected with a meanness contracted from their uncritical commitment to contemporary conservatism — a meanness that is incompatible with Christianity.
If partisan politics places us in an antagonistic posture toward the poor, the sick, the immigrant, and the 2.2 million people in American prisons, we have placed ourselves among those condemned by Jesus as “goats” for failing to show mercy to “the least of these.” This is troubling.
A careful reading of the parable of the Sheep and the Goats (Matthew 25:31–46) shows that Jesus is not strictly speaking about an afterlife judgment, but about what happens “when the Son of Man comes in his glory.” According to Jesus, the coming of the Son of Man is not an event postponed to a distant future, but an imminent event. On the night of his arrest, Jesus told the High Priest Caiaphas that he (Caiaphas) would witness the coming of the Son of Man. “But I tell you, ‘from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'” (Matthew 26:64) During his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus claimed to be the Son of Man referred to in Daniel 7 — the humane ruler who is the alternative to the beasts of empire. It is to this Son of Man that the Ancient of Days gives everlasting dominion over the nations. When Jesus, the Son of Man, was vindicated by God in resurrection and given all authority in heaven and on earth, the nations were given a Christ-informed moral arc that if followed leads to what Jesus describes as “the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” But if the nations reject the way of Jesus, it leads them to “the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” Jesus teaches us that the nations that care for the impoverished, the infirm, the immigrant, and the imprisoned enter the Father's kingdom, while those nations who ignore “the least of these” are on the path to a smoldering Gehenna.
This is something we should take very seriously. I'm not talking about whether you vote for an elephant or a donkey, but whether you follow the Lamb. I'm talking about the attitude of your heart. What is your general disposition toward…
The poor?
Those in need of health care?
Immigrants (documented or not)?
America's vast prison population?
If your attitude is one of indifference, distrust, disgust, anger, or moral superiority, may I suggest that you are being carried by the spirit of the age toward meanness as you fly away from mercy.
For a follower of Jesus, no loyalty to a political ideology can justify a turn away from mercy and toward meanness.
Meanness is not cool, it's not tough, it's not admirable; it is diabolical. It's simply not like Jesus.
Remember what James the brother of Jesus said…
“Judgment will be without mercy to anyone who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.” (James 2:13)
Mercy triumphs over judgment. That's tattoo worthy. I recommend tattooing it on your soul!
When you can blame…have mercy.
When you can shame…have mercy.
When you can criticize…have mercy.
When you can condemn…have mercy.
When you have a political disagreement…have mercy.
When you have a theological disagreement…have mercy.
When you are certain you are completely right…have mercy.
When you could exact your revenge and get even…have mercy.
So that when you pray, “Lord, have mercy on me”—
There will be a large reservoir of mercy for God to draw from.
I hope this post doesn't anger those of you with a passion for politics. This is not a plug for any particular political ideology — it is a plea for mercy. It is a plea that we who are followers of Jesus would be known, not for meanness, but for mercy. Like my dad was.
Lord, have mercy.
Christ, have mercy.
Lord, have mercy.

Every time we hear about a new Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project—like bioengineering new life forms or enlisting preteens to test advanced military software—it's like being pulled into the pages of a pulpy scifi paperback. The agency's newest project continues this trend: implantable chips that can heal soldiers' bodies and minds.
The goal of the program, dubbed ElectRX, is the development of tiny chips that can be injected into soldiers with a needle to act as pacemakers for the nervous system. By precisely stimulating the right nerve endings with minute electromagnetic signals, the implants will treat painful and chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and mental illnesses, researchers say.
What's more, a joint fact sheet released by the Department of Defense and the Veteran's Association revealed that DARPA scored a cool 78 million dollars to build the chips as part of the US government's Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) program.
"Instead of relying only on medication—we envision a closed-loop system that would work in concept like a tiny, intelligent pacemaker," said Doug Weber, DARPA program manager, in a statement. "It would continually assess conditions and provide stimulus patterns tailored to help maintain healthy organ function, helping patients get healthy and stay healthy using their body's own systems."

Although treating physical ailments is first on the agenda for ElectRX, DARPA is looking to eventually expand the treatment possibilities of the chips to mental illnesses like PTSD.
DARPA has been working on chips that can treat mental illness through its Systems-Based Neurotechnology for Emerging Therapies (SUBNETS) program for over a year, and ElectRX appears to be building upon the research undertaken so far. SUBNETS, like ElectRX, aims to use electrical impulses to regulate abnormal impulses caused by the disorder in question.
Devices that treat diseases with electrical pulses are already used in clinical settings, but DARPA researchers say they're about the size of a deck of cards. This poses a series of problems. For one, sticking something that large inside of you is bound to smart, and the devices often cause side effects due to their lack of precision. ElectRX aims to solve both of these problems.
The issue of size is somewhat self-explanatory—they're going to make the chips miniscule. The precision element is both tricky and interesting in turn: tricky, because extremely advanced biosensors and electromagnetic devices need to be invented in order to target nerve endings with precision, the researchers say. The interesting part is that when it comes to stimulating nerve endings to treat an individual's ailments, precision also means personalization.
The military has made gains in the field of hyper-personalized medicine and healthcare recently. The Army, for instance, has been looking into being able to bioprint replacement skin tailored to an individual soldier' needs on the spot. 3D-printed food containing a cocktail of vitamins tailored to specific dietary needs is also in the works.
Even if ElectRX implants are far off—just another entry into DARPA's growing collection of totally bonkers science projects—we could be looking at a future where soldiers are implanted with chips that regulate their chronic diseases, fed with food designed to meet their unique dietary needs, and healed with body parts printed just for them.
With the help of partners like the United States Postal Service, Discover Card and companies that perform background checks, LifeLock monitors change-of-address filings and applications for credit cards and jobs made in the names of its customers, so it can alert them. TrustedID, a LifeLock competitor, recently introduced a service that analyzes both public and proprietary data to assess a person's risk of identity theft — for example, the risk would increase if a person's Social Security number was found to be associated with a different address — and recommends actions to lower your risk score.

LifeLock and CardCops, among others, scour the Internet and hacker chat rooms and warn customers if their data is spotted. LifeLock, for one, also tries to infiltrate hacker communities.
Perhaps the most interesting new arrival in this space is StolenIDsearch.com, a site operated by TrustedID, which uses a database created by Colin Holder, a 30-year veteran of Scotland Yard, that contains stolen records gathered from longtime, trusted informants.
The database holds about 138 million records tied to an estimated 54 million people, about 98 percent of whom live in the United States, and searching it is free. “It shows you who the bad guys are looking for: the rich Americans,” said Scott Mitic, TrustedID's chief.
If any personal information — e-mail address and password, credit card number, Social Security number, bank account login details — is there, the site will describe, generically, what it has. It costs $15 to see the records, which Mr. Holder says covers administrative costs and helps ensure that only people entitled to the information receive it. (He also provides the data to banks and law enforcement agencies.)
SIDESTEPPING MALWARE Other products focus on outmaneuvering malicious programs that infiltrate PCs. Such malware has mushroomed recently, and antivirus companies have struggled to catch every new attack. SafeCentral ($40 for up to three computers; Windows only), a product from the security software company Authentium, protects users even if there's malware on the computer. It includes a stripped-down and secure browser to use when banking, trading stocks, viewing health information or shopping online.
When a user visits such a site, SafeCentral asks if the user wants to proceed securely. If the answer is yes, a background resembling armor plating appears. In this safe room of sorts, certain Windows features regularly abused by attackers have been disabled.

Computer programming interfaces known as A.P.I.'s, which game makers can use to turn keyboards into controllers, for example, are turned off because “keylogger” programs use them to capture information. SafeCentral also turns screenshots of Web pages blank to defeat these programs. Also off are A.P.I.'s that programmers use for browser plug-ins. This stops malicious plug-ins that monitor encrypted Web sessions — the ones where the URL changes from “http” to “https” — in case credit card numbers are transmitted.

And because so-called phishing scams use fake Web sites to collect username and password information, SafeCentral takes an extra step to verify the authenticity of the sites it visits.
GIVE OUT NOTHING Another alternative is to avoid sharing information online in the first place. Kemesa, a software company, has created a shopping-safety product called Shop Shield that starts with a familiar browser-based tool for managing passwords and auto-filling Web forms — which helps defend against keyloggers (which can record every keystroke made on a keyboard). In addition, Shop Shield users can give online merchants anonymous personal data, like single-use credit card numbers and specialized e-mail addresses.
Of course, you have to trust Kemesa with your personal information. “They become a target. They're very tempting now,” Mr. Vamosi of Javelin said.

Kemesa says it has created a “digital fortress.” To start, the product (which uses an add-on for the Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers and a Web site), puts an encrypted token on the computer, which makes it extremely difficult for a remote attacker to gain access to personal records. This also means the user must authorize each computer to run the program.
At Kemesa, customer information is not just encrypted, it's broken up into tiny pieces that are then stored in different databases on different networks, making reassembly by an attacker grueling. It also monitors for intrusions, regularly tests its defenses, keeps its physical location in lockdown and otherwise sticks to Defense Department security standards.
Shop Shield offers three pricing plans: a scaled-back service that's free if payments to merchants are tied to a checking account; one that charges $2 each time you use a credit card and small fees for other features; and an unlimited, full-service plan for $10 a month or $99 a year. Kemesa also profits from interchange fees that credit card companies collect on purchases.
Shop Shield is “a phenomenal concept,” said Jay Foley, co-founder of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. He brought up the case of theft involving a DSW Shoe Warehouse database in 2005, in which hackers obtained 1.4 million credit card numbers and the names on those accounts. “Imagine if with DSW, all the data that they had was from Shop Shield: one-time-use credit card numbers, no home addresses, no phone numbers.”
The chief executive of Kemesa, Steve Bachenheimer, would agree. “Thieves can't steal what isn't there,” he said.
When Forward Russia released their debut album Give Me A Wall in 2006, they were part of the exciting nucleus of an electric web of burgeoning Yorkshire bands garnering a lot of attention from the national music press. They attracted critical adoration and with it a loyal fanbase, thanks in part to a relentless touring regime combined with a memorable live show. However when the band announced an unexpected hiatus just three months after the release of their second album, there was to be no farewell tour. Just cold turkey for a legion of dedicated fans unable to obtain a last live hit.
Fast forward almost six years later to 2013 and the much-loved Leeds venue of the Brudenell Social Club, now synonymous with the local scene and intertwined with the band's history, were preparing to celebrate their centenary year. And it was the Brudenell's manager Nathan Clarke who managed to coax the band out of their hiatus for one last gig to mark the venue's hundredth year in November 2013. Whilst the gig was busy selling out in less than one day, journalist and photographer Tom Airey had begun contacting the band asking to document the process of their reunion. He was fortunate enough to be granted access to record everything from the first tentative rehearsals, right through to each cable-choked yelp and furious guitar pick of the “final gig”. As well as talking with those most closely affiliated to the band, from management to their biggest champion, Steve Lamacq. Tom's resulting film, streaming first on DiS below, superbly captures both the energy and emotion of the evening and what it meant to both band and fans.
Nearly a year to the day since the gig, DiS' Daniel O'Dell caught up with all four of the band to reflect on the reunion, the film and the future…
When you think back to the night of the Brudenell gig, what are your abiding memories?
TOM: I remember being more nervous than usual. It was great fun though; we got to see loads of people we hadn't seen for ages. The majority of the people who were really important to the band - people we'd worked with, people we'd befriended along the way, and the biggest fans, were all in one room, so it was a terrific atmosphere. And the gig wasn't a total disaster, which was a bonus!
ROB: For me, the Brudenell gig was the perfect 'ending' for the Forward Russia journey. To have a sold out crowd singing every word is a feeling like no other. It was the first time the girlfriend saw us play as well, as we got together after the hiatus. I would tell her the odd story about my past life and I don't think she quite believed me so it was great for her to share that moment with me.
What was it like watching the gig footage back?
WHISKAS: Funny, sort of funny to play a gig with that kind of reaction at the Brudenell that was 'us'. Funny watching us do the kind of thing we were doing a few years ago, creaking around the stage.
KATIE: I've not seen loads, just the bits Tom has put into the little film. Looks good doesn't it? It doesn't seem like it's me / us. It's like watching some real band instead of some jokers trying to flog a dead horse ha.
Did you expect such a reaction to the initial gig announcement?
TOM: Not at all. I expected it to sell out eventually but to do it in one day was unreal. It was very exciting and one of my favourite days being in the band, probably, just because everyone was so positive.
WHISKAS: We didn't feel the need to give many people the heads-up about the announcement, just that if people wanted to get tickets, yeah it might sell out in a few weeks, hopefully even a week or so. But one day was ridiculous, and I was on the phone to the record shops in Leeds on the Tuesday morning to try and get the last few tickets to make sure all my mates could get in.
What was it like being followed around and rehearsing with cameras present?
ROB: Easy! I don't actually remember them being there much. None of us particularly play up to camera, so it was all business really. We were too busy trying to work out how we played all the songs.
KATIE: Yeah it was a bit weird. I used to take a camcorder with us on tour so I used to bug people with that, so it was weird being on the other end. I think on the day it was probably the last thing on my mind though.
What is it like getting reacquainted with past songs, some of which you created nearly a decade ago?
TOM: I think I found it easier than anyone else, just by virtue of having the easiest job. I didn't really have too many problems remembering the lyrics or structures. My already limited keyboard skills were even worse than before, though; I had stickers on the keys indicating the correct starting point for each song!
I do remember feeling like I was doing an impression of myself singing at first. That was really, really odd. Luckily that passed after a practice or two.
WHISKAS: I could generally remember the key riff of the songs, but whole chunks of the rest were gone for me. There were probably 2 or 3 bits, that even by the gig I was blagging a bit because I couldn't remember them.
With the Brudenell gig selling out in less than a day was there a temptation to play more shows or festivals further afield?
TOM: There was some brief discussion that it might have been nice but no one offered us anything and we weren't going to go out looking. I think it was the right thing in the end. A lacklustre show elsewhere would have spoiled things.
KATIE: I would have loved to. But then you think “why are we doing this?” and at the end of the day we did it for Nathan and the Brudenell and people that really gave a shit. I appreciate that some people will have missed out ( There are loads of bands I love that split and played 1 or 2 gigs - it's not like I can just jump on a plane to Washington DC to see Faraquet). I guess if we played any more shows it would become a - "well what monetry value would you put on us?" and I don't like the idea of that. I'd do it because I want to play and be on stage having fun making music and seeing kids rock out, not so that I can upgrade my lifestyle a bit.
WHISKAS: Yeah, there was, I think we briefly considered doing another day at the Brudenell, but didn't know how we'd feel after this gig, and if doing another one might taint it. Similarly, a couple of people sounded us out about a London gig, but we weren't overly interested and nothing special enough came up, unlike the Town Hall gig.
After the Brudenell gig you went on to play Leeds Town Hall, how did that gig come to happen? Did it require a lot of discussion / argument?
WHISKAS: There genuinely wasn't any plan to do anything else after the Brudenell gig, and it was a good month or two after it that we got asked to play the Town Hall. I'm closely involved in Live At Leeds, organising an industry day called The Unconference and a Football Tournament over the weekend, and the lads who book it casually mentioned one day they were stuck for a headliner for the Town Hall, and it could be a laugh if we did it. It was probably the only gig / slot that would have been enticing, and I think we all quite fancied the idea of playing the Town Hall as it's a great venue.
KATIE: I can't really remember. I just said yes. Seemed like a good idea. I enjoyed that gig a lot more because I felt less pressure about it being a one off and messing up that one night. And again we were in good company with I Like Trains on the bill too, and things logistically were a bit easier having done it once before.
Have the reunion gigs done anything to re-shape your memories and feelings towards the band and what you achieved?
ROB: Definitely. We had kids coming up to us after who never saw us live the first time around and they were just as excited about the whole thing as people were back in the day. That's really humbling. For me, the gig felt like a celebration of what we achieved.
TOM: It's probably made me a bit more proud of what we achieved than before: doing the gigs made us all reassess the band and what it's meant to our lives. It was really gratifying to see how much the people who liked our music cared. You see that when it's happening but you're so exhausted and bewildered that you don't fully appreciate it.
Could there be a future for Forward Russia?
WHISKAS: I dunno, I've pretty much said 'not' twice and we've done these so you never know. I don't think any of us are in the place to commit to the band again and we sort of enjoyed the two gigs for what they were - it would be a shame to do something else that became unenjoyable.
ROB: I doubt it. Everyone has their own commitments that would make touring / writing / recording really difficult. Perhaps we'll do another show in 10 years, fatter and balder.
KATIE: I'd never say never. There are two things I would really like to do though - Primavera and Glastonbury!

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The European drugs watchdog is recommending doctors do not prescribe the anti-obesity drug rimonabant, also known as Acomplia. The European Medicines Agency has said the risk of serious psychiatric problems and even suicide are too high. The EMEA says since at-risk patients cannot be identified, marketing of the drug should be suspended. Patients taking the drug should consult their doctor, but do not need to immediately stop taking the medication. Psychiatric risk Around 97,000 people in the UK who are obese or overweight have been prescribed rimonabant, which is used in conjunction with diet and exercise. And approximately 20,000 are currently taking the drug. It was approved for use by the NHS watchdog in England and Wales in June this year. Patients who are currently taking Acomplia should consult their doctor or pharmacist at a convenient time to discuss their treatment
EMEA statement There have always been concerns over the risks of depression and suicide associated with the drug, and in July last year, the EMEA warned it may be unsafe for patients also taking anti-depressants. Doctors were also told not to give it to patients with a history of major depression, and to be alert for new symptoms of depression in patients taking the drug. But data from more recent studies, and from Sanofi-Aventis itself, has shown there is around double the risk of psychiatric disorders in obese or overweight patients taking rimonabant compared to those taking dummy pills. And between June and August 2008, there were five suicides among patients taking part in a trial who were on the drug, compared with one among those taking the dummy version. 'Important therapy' The EMEA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which assessed the new evidence, also said that the drug was less effective in reality than clinical trials had suggested, as patients only tended to take it for a short period. The EMEA said in a statement: "Prescribers should not issue any prescriptions for Acomplia [rimonabant] and should review the treatment of patients currently taking the medicine. "Patients who are currently taking Acomplia should consult their doctor or pharmacist at a convenient time to discuss their treatment. "There is no need for patients to stop treatment with Acomplia immediately, but patients who wish to stop can do so at any time." My patients were doing very well on it, and they will now have to stop and come off it
Dr Colin Waine, National Obesity Forum Dr June Raine of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) backed the EMEA's advice. Professor Steve Field, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said he was not surprised by the decision. "I was concerned when the drug was first approved, so I support the EMEA." In a statement, Sanofi-Aventis said it would comply with the EMEA's decision, but that it believed rimonabant would remain "an important therapeutic answer to a highly prevalent and increasing unmet medical need". Dr Colin Waine, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: "My patients were doing very well on it, and they will now have to stop and come off it." "Patient safety must be foremost, but I always thought that if you ruled out the patients with depression, you ruled out the problem with the drug."

WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan panel of justice experts recommends states stop using a drug "cocktail" for death penalty lethal injections.
"States are urged to adopt a one-drug protocol that achieves death by an overdose of a single anesthetic or barbiturate, as opposed to the three-drug method," The Constitution Project's Death Penalty Committee recommended in a report Wednesday. "A one-drug method would decrease the problems associated with drug administration and eliminate the risks from using paralyzing or painful chemical agents."
The report notes that a one-drug method is preferred by veterinarians euthanizing animals because it is "more humane and less prone to error."
Oklahoma used a three drug cocktail from sources it won't disclose in the botched execution of murderer Clayton Lockett last week.
The Constitution Project's Death Penalty Committee, a group that includes criminal justice experts and former elected officials, made 38 other recommendations in the report. The Constitution Project is a bipartisan think tank based in Washington.
“From the moment of arrest to the moment of death, the criminal justice system faces vexing challenges in carrying out the ultimate punishment,” former Texas Gov. Mark White (D), a co-chair of the committee who oversaw 19 executions, said in a statement.
The shadows of United States President Barack Obama and Malia Obama are reflected in the president's sunglasses as he waves to the assembled press as the first family returns to the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC as the first family returns from their two-week Hawaiian vacation on Sunday, January 3, 2016. In the coming weeks, the president plans to use executive orders to strengthen gun controls. Pool Photo by Ron Sachs/UPI | License Photo
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (UPI) -- Back from holiday vacation, President Obama is preparing to go back to work -- without Congress. Motivated by the rash of gun violence the country has suffered over the last several years, Obama is intent on strengthening America's gun laws.
Obama will make a pitch for public support in an hour-long live town hall meeting, to be held on Thursday evening. The meeting will be hosted by Anderson Cooper and broadcast on CNN.
Mass shooting after mass shooting has offered Obama a number of chances to appeal for the political clout necessary to move gun legislation on Capitol Hill. But there's been little movement.
While Obama may be keen to galvanize popular support among the public, he won't necessarily wait for Congress.

The president has increasingly exercised his executive powers to carry out his domestic agenda -- most recently on climate change, bolstering emissions standards. He's promised to take a similar approach to gun control.
Specifically, the administration plans to require licensing for more small-scale gun sellers who are currently exempt from certain regulations. As Politico recently reported, this would close the so-called gun show loophole and require these sellers to conduct background checks. The White House would also like to strengthen rules on reporting lost and stolen guns.
Those plans have been criticized by Republican leaders and GOP presidential hopefuls.
"It's wrong," Jeb Bush said on Fox News Sunday. "To use executive power that he doesn't have is a pattern that is quite dangerous."
Donald Trump promised to repeal any executive orders on gun control.
"I will veto," Trump told a crowd of supporters in Mississippi on Saturday. "I will unsign that so fast."
Dylan Voller: Former Don Dale detainee drops out of race for Alice Springs Town Council
Posted
Controversial former youth detainee Dylan Voller has announced he will not run for a spot on the Alice Springs Town Council after all.
His withdrawal from the race caps a volatile three days for the 19-year-old, in which he announced his candidacy, and then sparked a minor scandal on social media when a photograph surfaced on Facebook of him sitting in a car with what appeared to be a gun on the passenger seat.
Now, he has confirmed to the ABC he will not run for council and has taken to social media to explain his reasons.
"I'm sad to announce I am not going to run for council as I am not ready," he posted on Friday morning.
"I want to focus on building up trust and support within the community. We do need more strong Indigenous people in power and at this time I am not ready. I am sorry.
"This is sad but a decision I have to make that will affect my future and my mental health."
'I would like to use my voice'
Mr Voller announced on Wednesday he would seek a seat on the council, saying he hoped to use his experience of the youth justice system to help find long-term solutions to youth crime in Alice Springs and represent the whole community, including those who disparaged him.
"I'm one of the people in this community that has a voice now and I would like to use my voice to help out a lot of people who don't have a voice," he said.
"I've got a pretty good insight into that sort of stuff [youth crime and detention] so I want to be able to work with the kids and with their families and communicate with the council to be able to take their concerns up to people to listen."
At the time, Mr Voller said he did not have any policies to propose, but would consult with the community to find out what was important to them.
"I will listen to everyone, not one certain group or one certain colour or one certain age group. I'll be listening to everyone," he said.
"If we don't listen to all those different opinions there's never going to be an outcome."
Mr Voller said he had no other political aspirations.
"I don't really think politics is my thing, but this is just something I can do to help the community, I guess."
'It was a toy gun'
On Thursday, the day after he announced his candidacy, Mr Voller was lambasted on social media for being photographed with what appeared to be a handgun.
Mr Voller said he did not know the replica gun was on the seat when the photo was being taken, nor did he know it had been uploaded onto Facebook.
He added he had taken the gun to the Alice Springs police station.
"It was causing a lot of drama over social media and I didn't want anyone to feel threatened or scared, so I dropped it in out of the way," he said.
"It was a toy gun, it was fake… I've just got to think a lot harder before letting someone take photos of me."
NT Police said their investigations were ongoing, but no complaints had been made.
Video of Mr Voller strapped into a chair with a spit hood over his head featured in a Four Corners episode that sparked a royal commission into conditions in Northern Territory youth detention centres.

Dennis Pronunciation Gender Male Language(s) English, Danish, Swedish Name day Sweden: August 7 Origin Meaning Dionysus Region of origin Greece Other names Alternative spelling Denis, Dennys Variant form(s) Denise (Female) Nickname(s) Denny Related names Denis
Dennis or Denis is a first or last name from the Greco-Roman name Dionysius, via one of the Christian saints named Dionysius.
The name came from Dionysus, the Greek god of ecstatic states, particularly those produced by wine, which is sometimes said to be derived from the Greek Dios (Διός, "of Zeus") and Nysos or Nysa (Νῦσα), where the young god was raised. Dionysus (or Dionysos; also known as Bacchus in Roman mythology and associated with the Italic Liber), the Thracian god of wine, represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but also its social and beneficent influences. He is viewed as the promoter of civilization, a lawgiver, and lover of peace — as well as the patron deity of both agriculture and the theater.
Dionysus is a god of mystery religious rites, such as those practiced in honor of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis near Athens. In the Thracian mysteries, he wears the "bassaris" or fox-skin, symbolizing new life. (See also Maenads.)
A mediaeval Latinised form of the Anglo-Norman surname Le Denys was Dacus, which correctly meant Dacian, but when the Vikings were about was often used to mean "Danish" or "The Dane". The name became modernised as Denys, then later than Dennis.
Alternative forms and spellings of the name include Denis, Denys, Denish, Deon, Deonne, Deonte, and Dion, Dionice. Diminutive forms include Den, Dennoh, Deno, Denny, Deny and Deen.
The name Sydenie (alternate spellings: Sydney or Sidney) may derive from a village in Normandy called Saint-Denis.[citation needed]
A medieval diminutive was Dye, from which the names Dyson and Tyson are derived.[citation needed]
Dennis is a very popular English, Irish and Danish name, common throughout the English-speaking world.
Denis is a very popular French name, common throughout the Francophone world, but is also a common English, Irish, German, Italian, Dutch, Croatian, Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Brazilian, Bosnian, and Albanian name.
Dionizy is the Polish version of the name.
Deniz is the Turkish version of the name. The Turkish language word for "sea" is "deniz", e.g. Kara Deniz means the Black Sea.
The Irish name Donnchadh may be anglicised as Denis, but has a different origin. Dionigi or Dionisio are Italian versions of the name, although Denis is quite common in Italy.
Feminine versions of the name include: Denise, Denisa, Deni, Denice, Deniece, Dione, and Dionne.

A 91-year old woman in Thailand has earned a college degree after spending more than 10 years studying for it and has received her diploma from the country's king.
Public television broadcaster Thai PBS says Kimlan Jinakul was granted the Bachelor of Arts degree in human and family development on Wednesday at the government-run Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University just outside Bangkok.
"If we do not study, do not read, do not know, then we won't be able to speak and make sense," she said.
Her diploma was handed to her by King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun, who took the throne last year. Diplomas at Thailand's public universities are traditionally handed out by members of the royal family.

"I am happy and honoured that the king has graciously shown such limitless mercy," Kimlan said, using a phrase meant to show utmost respect to Thai royalty.
Kimlan travelled with her family from their home in Phayao province, 725km north of Bangkok, to attend the graduation ceremony.
"Sometimes she felt weary because of her body," Kimlan's son, Mongkol Jinakul, told Thai PBS. "But we as her children tried to cheer her on and Mom studied until the end and it was a success."
The Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, which has courses catering for the elderly, this year had 199 students who are more than 60 years old. It offers part-time and remote learning.
"For the elderly, we focus on practicality rather than the academic aspect," Professor Panumas Kadngaongam, acting dean of the university, said. "So the subject can be studied and put to use immediately."
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (teva) is expected to cut 20-25% of its workforce in Israel, where it employs 6,860 people, and a few thousand more jobs are to go in the United States, financial news website Calcalist said on Thursday.
The world's largest generic drugmaker will send termination letters to “tens of percents” of its 10,000 employees in the United States in coming weeks, Calcalist said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Teva's new Chief Executive Kare Schultz is working out the details with regional management in Israel and the United States, Calcalist said, adding that those set to be ousted include its chief scientific officer and president of research and development, Michael Hayden.
A spokesman for Teva declined to comment on the report.
In response to the report, the Histadrut labour federation said it would not accept any unilateral moves by Teva's management.
“Any efficiency measures, if and when they arise, will be done through negotiations and with the agreement of the Histadrut and the labour unions,” Histadrut spokesman Yaniv Levi said. “Lay-offs are the last resort.”
Teva's share price was 2.9% lower in Tel Aviv at at 1343 GMT.

Teva is widely expected to implement a cost-cutting programe following the publication of third-quarter results earlier this month.
The company said it would miss 2017 profit forecasts due to falling prices of generics in the U.S. market and weakening sales of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.

Saddled with nearly $35 billion in debt due to its $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan's generic drug business Actavis last year, investors have been pushing Teva for clarity on its future.
“It will be an absolute priority for me that we stabilize the company's operating profit and cash flow in order to improve our financial profile,” Schultz said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
Interim Chief Financial Officer Mike McClellan has said the company was “working on a 2018 plan and evaluating all options”.
Teva has been selling off assets to help meet its debt payments.
Fitch Ratings this month downgraded Teva's debt to junk.
It started last November. A week after Skyrim had released, Todd Howard and his team at Bethesda Game Studios had their first Game Jam. The concept was simple: Howard told his team members to spend the next week putting something cool in the game. It could be whatever they wanted and while it may never get released, it was a cool exercise for a team that was likely pretty beaten up from the grueling bug-fixing stage. A video, first publicly released at DICE, revealed some of these creations to the world. One of these creations was the addition of a slew of new kill cams which have already been added to the game as a free update. The next Game Jam idea is already planned for release: voice control functionality with Kinect. Earlier this week, we had the chance to test the Kinect update by belting some dragon shouts in a hotel room in midtown Manhattan.
It started last November. A week after Skyrim had released, Todd Howard and his team at Bethesda Game Studios had their first Game Jam.

It could be whatever they wanted and while it may never get released, it was a cool exercise for a team that was likely pretty beaten up from the grueling bug-fixing stage. A video, first publicly released at DICE, revealed some of these creations to the world.
One of these creations was the addition of a slew of new kill cams which have already been added to the game as a free update. The next Game Jam idea is already planned for release: voice control functionality with Kinect. Earlier this week, we had the chance to test the Kinect update by belting some dragon shouts in a hotel room in midtown Manhattan.
Skyrim's Kinect functionality is strictly limited to voice controls (so no swinging your invisible sword or anything like that). That said, the voice controls are pretty diverse.
The first feature we tested: dragon shouts. (Sadly Bethesda wouldn't let us film the experience, so you don't get to hear me sounding like a jackass.) There are two ways to use dragon shouts with Kinect. The first is just to say the English name for a given dragon shout. For example: "Slow Time" will cause you to use the "Slow Time" shout. It doesn't need to be equipped, so you can say the name of any shout you have already unlocked. If you say the English name, the game will automatically have you cast the highest level shout for that word.
But there are plenty of you who probably want to be all legit and yell dragon shouts in the true dragon language, just like Dovahkiin does in the game. You can do that too. While holding the right bumper, you can say individual dragon words to call up different levels of shouts. So, for example, if you only want a level one "Unrelenting Force," you can just say "FUS!" while holding down the right bumper. If you want to do the full level three version, you do the same, but you say the full "FUS RO DAH!" instead. Simple as that.
Admittedly, accuracy here was a bit of an issue, especially when using the dragon language. I had a tough time getting a specific level shout to activate right when I wanted it, and sometimes other shouts would be called by accident. The English version seemed much more reliable, though.
Beyond shouts, you can navigate Skyrim's menu, saying things like "Quick Magic, Destruction, Fireball" to select your fire spell. You can also assign favorites to voice. For example, saying "Assign shield" while highlighting your favorite shield will cause the game to equip that shield whenever you say "Equip shield." You can do this with a number of different categories, from swords to bows to magic types.
Other handy additions include being able to quick save or quick load by just saying those words. I was actually able to quick load with my voice while I was falling off a cliff. Theoretically you could do the same with the "Become Ethereal" shout to save yourself from a nasty fall.
Inventory nuts will also appreciate the ability to sort by weight and value using voice. You can also set loot thresholds so that you'll automatically pick up only objects of X value and higher, thus keeping you from becoming bogged down with unnecessary carrots.
All told, the Kinect update is cute and occasionally pretty handy. Based on the so-so accuracy I wouldn't really trust the Kinect controls when your life is on the line, but when it comes to navigating menus or calling out your favorite shouts, it'll probably help you shave off a few mindless seconds here and there. For a free update, it's pretty hard to complain about.
"There are going to be other ideas that will be implemented. How those are going to be deployed...is still being determined." Fingers crossed for dragon riding.
During my play session, Matt Grandstaff, Senior Community Manager at Bethesda, mentioned that we haven't seen the last of the updates from that Game Jam video. "There are going to be other ideas that will be implemented," he told me. "How those are going to be deployed, whether it's downloadable content or through future updates, is still being determined." Fingers crossed for dragon riding.
Oh, and still holding your breath waiting for honest-to-goodness Skyrim DLC? Said Grandstaff, "I think you're going to hear stuff pretty soon. It's not too far off. They are looking at sizable content that they want to do. [Fallout 3's] 'Point Lookout' was referenced as a benchmark. It might be a little bit bigger or around that size."
My day didn't start great. The first thing I read was Michael Dubakov's statement about enterprise software people (i.e., people like me) in Enterprise software vendors have no taste:
My current theory is that enterprise software vendors have no taste. CEO, VP of development, Product managers that focus on enterprise market — all of them have no fucking taste. There is no taste in companies [sic] DNA, nobody cares about design and aesthetic. Profits, revenue, sales and new features — yes! Beautiful design — no.
Nobody, you guys. Literally nobody. I guess I don't blame Michael for this false cause fallacy. It sure seems like a logical conclusion: product bad, therefore product person bad. As with most things, though, it's more complicated than that.
Let's start with the most difficult thing about designing in the enterprise space: in most cases, the people who buy the software and the people who use the software are completely different, and therefore have completely different needs. This is not a problem in the consumer market, where the person who gives you money is usually also the person who uses your product.
The people who buy enterprise software — IT managers, HR managers, etc. — care about things like configurability, control, more features than a competitor, and most of all: the ability to customize the thing just so, so that it fits in with whatever systems already exist. End users care about none of those things. They care about getting a job done as quickly and with as much enjoyment as possible.
So, what happens is what happens in most organizations that rely on outside sales. Many Sales teams go out and sell things that don't exist in the product. And they often sign contracts that have two things in it that make designers wake up in a cold sweat: (1) a list of features (or — ugh, I hate this term so much — “product requirements”), and (2) delivery dates.
Product people then have to fulfill the needs of the contract/promise (as opposed to the needs of end users) in never enough time. Instead of having the time to understand a problem and user needs, building hypotheses and testing them, and taking time to iterate, they make a thing to hit a deadline and then move on to the next thing that has a deadline.
And that's why enterprise software looks the way it looks. It's not that product people don't have taste. It's that they don't have agency.
But, I do want to say, there are welcome signs that this is changing. There is a new realization that the needs of buyers and end users can co-exist peacefully, and the result is better products. As an example, our new CEO is a huge advocate for design, and is pushing the organization to create “simple, smart, beautiful products.” This will take time, of course, but if you look at the new suite of apps that we're working on, you'll see that these are starting to look more like consumer products.
There are other things I think we can do to help along this shift:
Train sales teams on the ins and outs of product development. How prioritization works, how long things generally take, what the major user needs are that the product is trying to solve, etc. If they have more knowledge about how their promises affect the teams, it will go a long way to change behavior.
Spend as much time with end users as possible, record the sessions, and share it widely. Nothing gets an organization riled up about good design like seeing end users struggle with a product.
Start on a small product that no one cares about (like the mobile site maybe?). Follow a Lean UX process (or whatever methodology you subscribe to). Build it well, and show people the results. Then start moving the process into other areas.
So, anyway. Yeah, enterprise software is still, for the most part, pretty bad. It's time for us to break out of the constraints of the past that caused that, and do something better. It's actually a good time to be in enterprise software. There's so much opportunity, and a newfound agency for designers. I'm optimistic. The day can only get better from here.
Just two days after Reddit asked me to declare that I hadn't received any gift yet, a package was waiting me at the front door!
"Nice," I said, "now my Santa is going to think I'm a douche for reporting no gift either soon-- Well, hopefully he'll understand all this bureaucracy sh*t. Let's open the full thing now..."
The pack was wrapping what it seems to be some typical snacks from Louisiana. Well, that's something I'll have to check in my next visit to the US. If there is a place that I want to know is the location where "The Heart Of Angel" was filmed.
...
But there is MOAR! :)
A few days later (i.e. today,) I receive a second package. This time the content is some typical Cajun food! Honey, Pecan nuts, pepper sauce, pickles, garlic... and two recipe books for vegs!!
I must say, I had not so many presents and such a good christmas day since I was 8 at least... and that was more than 30 years ago.
THANK YOU SANTA!!
In this tutorial we will have a look at the Neo4j graph database and will start to integrate it into our Spring project. We will also query a Neo4j database and perform various operations like:
Create, Read, Update and Delete
Establish relationships
Query on the basis of relationships
Spring framework is an open source Java platform that provides MVC infrastructure support for developing robust Java applications very easily and very rapidly using recommended MVC pattern.
Neo4j
Neo4j is one of the most popular graph databases which stores data in nodes and provides relationships between them. It is written completely in Java.
In Neo4j uses another query language is used called Cypher Query Language (CQL), as opposed to the well-known Structured Query Language (SQL). Some of best features of this graph database are:
Open source
Schema free
NoSQL
Graph database
A Graph Database is also known as a Graph Database Management System and is the one which stores data in the form of Graph structures. To establish comparisons between a GDBMS and an RDBMS, let's compare their terminologies.
Tables become Graphs.
Rows are equivalent to Nodes.
Columns and Data are turned to properties and their values.
Constraints become relationships.
Joins are used as Traversals.
Terminologies
Understanding concepts in Neo4j becomes easier if we can relate them to relational database structures. Let's see the close analogy Neo4j follows with a traditional MySQL system:
A Graph is a collection of nodes and the relationships that connect those nodes.
Nodes and Relationships contain properties to represent data.
Properties are key-value pairs to represent data.
Advantages of Neo4j over RDBMS
The primary difference is that in a graph database, the relationships are stored at the individual record level, while in a relational database, the structure is defined at a higher level (the table definitions).
This has important advantages and disadvantages:
A relational database is much faster when operating on huge numbers of records. In a graph database, each record has to be examined individually during a query in order to determine the structure of the data, while this is known ahead of time in a relational database.
Relational databases use less storage space, because they don't have to store all of those relationships.
The graph data model allows storage of all the connections of the node along with the node, so that there is no additional step in computing connected data apart from reading the node into memory.
Spring Data Neo4j
Spring Data comes in with excellent support for the Neo4j Graph database.
To start, let's add the required Maven dependency in our project as:
<dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId> <artifactId>spring-data-neo4j</artifactId> <version>4.2.0.RELEASE</version> </dependency>
Let us also add Transaction support provided by the java Transaction API using its maven dependency:
<dependency> <groupId>javax.transaction</groupId> <artifactId>jta</artifactId> <version>1.1</version> </dependency>
Finally, we add the Java Validation API to validate against entities we're going to create:
<dependency> <groupId>javax.validation</groupId> <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId> <version>1.0.0.GA</version> </dependency>
To check for latest Maven releases, check here.
Next, we need to know about services offered for Neo4j with Spring data. Basically, there are four:
GraphRepository: This service is used to perform basic DB operations. GraphTemplate: Like other modules, this is a Spring template to perform Neo4j operations. CrudRepository: It is used to perform Neo4j CRUD operations with Cypher Query Language(CQL). PaginationAndSortingRepository: It is used to perform Paging and Sorting of Neo4j CQL Query results.
Neo4j Annotations
Now that we know about the services offered and have knowledge about the advantages of a Graph database, let's start by understanding how Spring Data handles entities.
Configuring Spring data Neo4j
To start, we need to declare a GraphDatabaseService bean and enable automatic Neo4j repository generation. Let's look at one of the beans defined here:
import org.Neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService; import org.neo4j.graphdb.factory.GraphDatabaseFactory; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.config.EnableNeo4jRepositories; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.config.Neo4jConfiguration; @Configuration @EnableNeo4jRepositories(basePackages="orders.db") public class Neo4jConfig extends Neo4jConfiguration { public Neo4jConfig() { setBasePackage("orders"); } @Bean(destroyMethod="shutdown") public GraphDatabaseService graphDatabaseService() { return new GraphDatabaseFactory() .newEmbeddedDatabase("/tmp/graphdb"); } }
The @EnableNeo4jRepositories annotation enables Spring Data Neo4j to automatically generate Neo4j repository implementations. Its basePackages is set so that it scans the orders.db package for interfaces that extend (directly or indirectly) any marker Repository interface.
Finally in the configuration class, we must define a GraphDatabaseService bean which will setup a connection with the Graph database. Let's see how to do that:
@Bean(destroyMethod="shutdown") public GraphDatabaseService graphDatabaseService(Environment env) { return new SpringRestGraphDatabase( "http://graphdbserver:7474/db/data/", env.getProperty("db.username"), env.getProperty("db.password")); }
Annotating Graph entities
Neo4j defines two type of entities: nodes and relationships. Node entities basically represent the things in our application, whereas relationship entities indicate how those things are related.
To start, let's define a User entity.
import java.util.LinkedHashSet; import java.util.Set; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.GraphId; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.NodeEntity; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.RelatedTo; @NodeEntity public class Order { @GraphId private Long id; private String customer; private String type; @RelatedTo(type="HAS_ITEMS") private Set<Item> items = new LinkedHashSet<Item>(); ... }
Apart from the @NodeEntity annotation for the User entity, id is also annotated with @GraphId annotation as all entities in Neo4j must have a graph ID. The items property is annotated with @RelatedTo, indicating that an Order is related to a Set of Item. The type attribute simply labels the relationship.
The Item entity will be same. Let's directly look at the relationship entity.
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.EndNode; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.GraphId; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.RelationshipEntity; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.StartNode; @RelationshipEntity(type="HAS_LINE_ITEM_FOR") public class LineItem { @GraphId private Long id; @StartNode private Order order; @EndNode private Product product; private int quantity; ... }
What makes relationship entities special is that they connect two node entities. The @StartNode and @EndNode annotations are applied to properties that define each end of a relationship. In this case, the Order is the start node and the Product is the end node.
Finally, LineItem has a quantity property that will be persisted to the database when the relationship is created.
Define repository
Now that we're done defining entities for nodes and relationships as well, let's move to adding an important part of the Data access layer, the repositories. For Order entity, the corresponding repository will look like:
import orders.Order; import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.GraphRepository; public interface OrderRepository extends GraphRepository<Order> {}
Just like the other Spring Data projects, Spring Data Neo4j triggers repository generation for interfaces that extend the Repository interface. In this case, OrderRepository extends GraphRepository, which indirectly extends Repository. Therefore, Spring Data Neo4j will generate an implementation for OrderRepository at runtime.
Now that it's done, we can use a handful of methods. Let have a look at some of them.
To save an order, simply do:
Order savedOrder = orderRepository.save(order);
To find a single order:
Order order = orderRepository.findOne(4L);
To get all orders:
EndResult<Order> allOrders = orderRepository.findAll();

Throughout history, American presidents have declared it their job to protect and advance the interests of the United States and its citizens. President Trump has shoehorned that wholesome, uncontroversial idea into a narrow-minded, exclusionary governing platform that's likely to alienate much of the world while hurting the very people whose because he claims to uphold.
In his campaign, his Inaugural Address and, most recently, his speech to Congress, Mr. Trump has proudly embraced the isolationist “America First” rallying cry from the 1930s while rejecting the internationalism of his predecessors. He has disparaged NATO, an alliance that has helped keep the peace in Europe for more than half a century; cozied up to Russia and its latter-day czar, Vladimir Putin; disdained global solutions to global problems like climate change and the surge of refugees from Syria, Iraq and elsewhere; and declared his intention to upend the international trading system created by the United States and its allies. Nowhere is his cramped vision more evident than in his scapegoating of unauthorized immigrants as criminals and his rejection of the American ideal of welcoming the foreign-born.
A GO-IT-ALONE APPROACH
Of late, Mr. Trump has seemed to back off from some of his views, as in his assertion on Tuesday evening that “we strongly support NATO.” But it is unclear what that will mean in practice, especially since Defense Secretary Jim Mattis repeated Mr. Trump's threat to “moderate” America's commitments to NATO if the allies don't pony up more for defense.
In one breath Mr. Trump tells Congress, “Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead”; minutes later, he says: “My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America.” No president can claim to represent the world; yet since World War II, all have accepted, even celebrated, America's unique power and ability to lead in promoting democracy, peace and free markets. The word “democracy” did not appear in Mr. Trump's speech, something that should have been central to this address. And he said little about working with allies on common interests.
Turkish PM Erdoğan storms out of Council of State speech over 'rudeness'
ISTANBUL – Hürriyet Daily News
Prime Minister Erdoğan walked out before Metin Feyzioğlu, the head of Turkey's bar association, finished his speech.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stormed out of a speech delivered by Turkish Union of Bars head Metin Feyzioğlu, accusing Feyzioğlu of being "rude" in a speech criticizing the government's performance."What you're saying is wrong," Erdoğan said near the end of the speech by Feyzioğlu, who was speaking on the occasion of the 146th anniversary of the establishment of the Council of State in Ankara."What am I saying that is wrong, Mr. Prime Minister?" Feyzioğlu asked in reply, prompting Erdoğan to angrily respond: "This kind of rudeness is impossible.""I'm not the one who's being rude, Mr. Prime Minister," the bar head then said.Erdoğan became incensed over Feyzioğlu's criticizing of the government's failure to provide permanent settlement to some survivors of the 2011 Van earthquakes. He stressed that many people were still living in rudimentary conditions in shipping containers.Rising from his seat to leave, Erdoğan interrupted the speech, saying Turkey's highest lawyer had "no legal right" to say such things. "Unfortunately, because of the law, we give a platform to things like this. You're making a political speech ... Everything you said about Van is a lie," he said.Sitting alongside Erdoğan, President Abdullah Gül attempted to calm Erdoğan down, but to no avail."I haven't been rude," Feyzioğlu said. "I'm not so bold as to tell anyone that they are being rude, Mr. Prime Minister. My speech was very inclusive."Speaking after the incident, he described Erdoğan's comments as "saddening." "I'm saying, 'let's embrace each other.' The prime minister stood up and made extremely saddening comments that superseded the limits of respect by an unfathomable level," he said.Here is the video footage of the incident from public broadcaster TRT:Speaking hours later, Erdoğan slammed Feyzioğlu during his opening speech at his ruling Justice and Development Party's (AKP) 22nd Consultation and Assessment Meeting in the western province of Afyonkarahisar."We watched a theatrical play at the Council of State today," he said at the start of the party's two-day camp, during which strategies for the upcoming presidential election in August will be discussed."These people have no respect. You're invited to an event. You have no legal right to speak. This gentleman spoke for an hour, while the head of the Council of State spoke for only 25 minutes. He made a completely political speech, which was irrelevant for the occasion. It was just for self-satisfaction. Take off your robe, if you love politics so much," Erdoğan continued, labeling Feyzioğlu as "a lost cause."Late last month, the prime minister was similarly enraged by a speech delivered by Constitutional Court head Haşim Kılıç, who called the government out for its alleged increasing authoritarianism. Erdoğan had expressed his discomfort through gestures and body language, and left without saying a word when Kılıç's speech finished.Erdoğan also criticized the Republican People's Party (CHP) during his speech in Afyonkarahisar on May 10, claiming that Turkey's main opposition "tries to create an atmosphere of mistrust in the country as it had done in the past during the 1960 and 1980 coups.""The foreign organizations are acting as a mouthpiece of the opposition's negative propaganda while criticizing freedoms and freedom of press in Turkey. The same organizations cannot dare to criticize their monarch, prime minister, opposition leader and other leadership of the country," Erdoğan argued.Turkish Prime Minister also said that the ruling AKP will announce its presidential candidate by the end of May or mid-June at latest.
Untitled
Specialops.yolasite.com ©2011 T he film's glaring failures are created while attempting to reveal the personalities of the characters. Sheen's off-duty shenanigans are annoying (like arbitrarily jumping off a bridge from a moving vehicle), but what really makes the viewer wish to see him get shot are his antics during missions. Not only are the supremely implausible, but the accompanying absurdity monumentally annihilates suspension of disbelief. The zenith of this tragic miscalculation comes when Sheen, while taking cover during a firefight stumbles on a cache of American missiles and impulsively lobs a grenade right into it, while being behind it, making a mad dash away from it. Director Lewish Teague expects the viewer to believe that he is able to evade both enemy bullets and the blast radius of the exploding cache of missiles in a matter of seconds. ( Scientific reasoning ).
A nother part has him disobeying, for no apparent reason, a direct order not to engage unalerted guards, precipitating a short, senseless firefight with grave consequences for the team. Insubordination and capricious, spur-of-the-moment actions that endanger lives are simply not the hallmarks of the Navy SEALS (or for that matter, any SOF unit), and would result in immediate disengagement of the operator from further missions and perhaps even dismissal. Even when SEALs die due to Sheen's utter stupidity, none of this happens. This inaccurate portrayal of procedures might explain why the U.S Military support to the project was 'limited'.
Joanne Whalley-Kilmer plays a Lebanese-American reporter with an expertise in the Middle East and the attempts of Curran and Hawkins to extract intel from her and the resulting mix of chemistry and jealousy that follow is only vaguely interesting and does not serve any good purpose (except to reaffirm the viewer's contempt for Sheen who offends Whalley with his casual use of epithets for the Japanese and Arabs). Biehn, of Terminator fame, performs fairly well, especially in the drama that succeeds the consequences of Sheen's actions. The last part of the film, set in Lebanon just prior to an Israeli invasion, lay ground for what could have been a saving grace. The lacklustre action scenes ensure it never happens. The gunfight scenes are quite dreary, with the exception of the scene of the SEAL sniper armed with his incendiary-rounds-firing rifle, offering a golden gleam of hope for technical fidelity.
Such types of sniper rifles have been used by to eliminate insurgents hiding behind concrete walls during the course of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Unit's Dennis Haysbert is a SEAL in this film.
Michael Biehn and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer.
The parking lot scene was shot at real-life SEAL hangout Ready Room (notice sign board).
If you're a Sheen fan, have a high tolerance for absurdity masquerading as entertainment, and have low expectations, this might do the trick when it comes on cable. Otherwise, if you are thinking of buying a DVD, do the wise thing: ignore the luring title, roll out of the way, Spetsnaz style, and radio for extraction.
"Sticks and stones may break my windows, but not RPGs and machinegun fire." The magic civilian vehicle (commandeered by the SEALS of course). REVIEW
..............................................................................................................
As far as depiction of the special forces of the U.S Navy is concerned, it is safe to cast this film as one of the most mediocre films yet. As a Hollywood action-flick, it is only weakly entertaining, a third-rate film with a first-rate cast. Written by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL himself, Navy SEALS, in spite of itself, is amateurish, from its pretentious facade to its non-existent substance. The biggest flaw of this Brenda Feigen production is that it takes itself too seriously, almost as if it's petulant to establish itself as a classic in an era where military films with the Tinsel Town's finest like Top Gear influenced everything from sun glasses and apparel to Air Force job applications, not to mention the hundreds of millions in box office receipts.
When a Navy helicopter responding to cargo ship's mayday call is machine-gunned and its crew taken hostage onshore by Middle Eastern terrorists, the Navy SEALS execute a rescue mission, discovering American missiles during the mission but fail to destroy them during the intense firefight that follows. From then on, it's basically mission after mission to locate and destroy the missiles, interspersed with weak, subplots along the way that aren't memorable, except for one brief KIA's widow scene. We are intimately introduced to only three of the operatives : Second in Command Hawkins (Sheen), Curran (Michael Biehn) as well as a surprisingly young Dennis Haysbert ('How about that ?'- get the reference ?). There are others too, including a sniper, but it is mainly these three and the chemistry between Sheen and Biehn that gets most attention.
However, this brief display of technical fidelity is extinguished when the Hollywood edict for outlandish but unintentionally laughable action scenes return : a civilian Sedan hijacked by the SEALs is impervious to RPGs and machine gun fire at very, very close range from a pursuing armoured vehicle. The climax in which the SEALS swim to the middle of the ocean to wait (or hope, as the submarine might have already left) for submarine extraction when they are pursued by militiamen who fire AKs and even an RPG, may appear dubious, but the truth is in real life, Navy SEALs have indeed evacuated by sea under fire in eerily similar circumstances, as exemplified by a squad of American and South Vietnamese SEALs in Northern Vietnam in 1972.
The flaws do not end (or begin) there, but the primary point is that it plainly failed to entertain me and almost nothing in the film moved me.

“ ” The fuckboy doth protest too much, methinks. —Queen Gertrude on RationalWiki brogressives
Brogressive is a peculiar snarl word used among some members of the social justice community to refer to men who agree with some, but not all, left wing opinions.
Like most such bits of jargon, it is irritatingly vague. It would appear to mean a "ciswhite het" male (a "bro")[notes 1] who alleges he supports social justice causes and concerns but when push comes to shove, is actually opposed to any action that would put even the smallest damper on his privileges.
Attempts at definition [ edit ]
Laura Jensen, writing at Slant, describes the "brogressive" in these terms:
“ ” The Brogressive loves [1][notes 2] The Brogressive loves Reddit , but hates Tumblr because it is "too whiney." The Brogressive #FeelsTheBern, but wrote an angry Facebook status about the #BlackLivesMatter protestors for "interrupting" Bernie Sanders in Seattle. The Brogressive is the college student-turned overly serious D.C. intern, who will politely clap when Senator Elizabeth Warren talks about equal pay for equal work, but is alarmingly quick to defend rapists, asking questions about false accusations. The Brogressive is all defensive wonk talk and no action, because at the end of the day, he does not need to work towards justice, since he already benefits from systems of power.
Apparently, allowing a presidential candidate to speak to the people who came to hear him is an opinion beyond the pale of reasonable discourse. So are certain preferences in social media. And to suggest that some people accused of a crime might not in fact be guilty is always rape apology. His greatest sin may be not being wholly on board with the privilege doctrine, because he "already benefits from systems of power".
Most importantly, this person is not an ally on issues where he agrees with the social justice agenda, but only a mere paper tiger, "all talk and no action", and overcautious. Despite his willingness to sign off on some political causes, he is "frustrating and hurtful" and, of course, "your new worst enemy".
Writing for The Guardian, Brigit Delaney paints the following picture:
“ ” Brogressives are a product of a society that has largely absorbed the language, norms and behaviours of “political correctness”. In this sense, Latham may not fit the bill entirely – he's never been particularly political correct, after all – but he's got brogressive DNA.
Brogressives are a product of a society that has largely absorbed the language, norms and behaviours of “political correctness”. In this sense, Latham may not fit the bill entirely – he's never been particularly political correct, after all – but he's got brogressive DNA. What was once progressive has been absorbed into the mainstream. It's not cool to be the person that doesn't support marriage equality, or thinks that women should be paid less for the same work as men, or that Australia wasn't invaded by Europeans. You'll get shouted down on social media if you hold those views. So the brogressive goes with that flow – but something in him refuses to budge.
It's the bro within that defines him, but also holds him back. What's at stake? By following the progressive agenda he has to share his power – with women, with so-called minorities, with people that in generations past have not had a seat at the boardroom table, or in the corporate box at the football, or in parliament.[2] It's the bro within that defines him, but also holds him back. What's at stake? By following the progressive agenda he has to share his power – with women, with so-called minorities, with people that in generations past have not had a seat at the boardroom table, or in the corporate box at the football, or in parliament.
For Delaney as well, the brogressive's sins are more verbal and symbolic, or matters of taste, rather than political:
Active on social media, changing his profile picture to rainbow colours in support of marriage equality and other progressive causes but still describes bad things as “so gay”.
Blames “political correctness gone mad” for not being able to tell rape jokes during his stand up comedy set.
Leaves the office early to take care of his children but says he has to go home to “babysit”.
We're not allowed to call babysitting "babysitting" any more?
Dianna E. Anderson paints a similar picture. Brogressives, according to her, can be found at anti-war and Occupy Wall Street rallies, where they pretend to support the causes. (Notice how easily he blends in at progressive rallies like Occupy and anti-war protests.)[3] But apparently his presence there is a pretext masking his inner selfishness:
“ ” You will find the Brogressive discussing things with others of his kind - things like the will find the Brogressive discussing things with others of his kind - things like the NSA and Wikileaks . Often, they will spend hours on Reddit discussing drone policy – but only insofar as drones serve to remind people of the Real Problems With American Foreign Policy. Sometimes, The Brogressive will describe himself as "socially liberal, but fiscally conservative." This is mainly because he would really, really like marijuana legalized.
“ ” The natural enemy of the Brogressive is the Intersectional Feminist. When the two come in conflict, the Brogressive retreats into his protective cave of White Male Privilege, accusing the Intersectional Feminist of being a distraction to the True Progressive Cause (which is, of course, getting [3][notes 3] The natural enemy of the Brogressive is the Intersectional Feminist. When the two come in conflict, the Brogressive retreats into his protective cave of White Male Privilege, accusing the Intersectional Feminist of being a distraction to the True Progressive Cause (which is, of course, getting Julian Assange out of Sweden so he can get away from those pesky rape charges).
Anderson suggests that this "brogressive" possesses an even more significant flaw: "He thinks Seth McFarlane is funny."[notes 4] Her issue, again, is that by not agreeing with each item on her checklist, he becomes "annoying".
Michael Darer is more succinct in his definition for the Huffington Post:
“ ” What is a Brogressive? I'm glad you asked. The Brogressive is a privileged individual (most often a white, straight, cis male) who outwardly claims to support progressive causes, but insists on doing so without challenging their own comfort or ideas.[4] What is a Brogressive? I'm glad you asked. The Brogressive is a privileged individual (most often a white, straight, cis male) who outwardly claims to support progressive causes, but insists on doing so without challenging their own comfort or ideas.
The nerve of this fellow! He says that he supports progressive causes, but like most people, he has a comfort zone he prefers to stay inside! Darer also accuses the 'brogressive' of insufficient zeal or an excess of caution in the causes he chooses to support. The underlying idea appears to be that his cishet maleness gives him a lived experience that doesn't match what he's supposed to say:
“ ” It's the guy who says he supports gay marriage, but really doesn't like how “they” need to be so “in-your-face” about it. It's the guy who claims to be opposed to domestic violence, but can't address the issue in his work without laying heavy blame on the victim. It's the television writer who says they oppose transphobia, but also perpetuate the stereotype of transwomen out to deceive straight men.[4] It's the guy who says he supports gay marriage, but really doesn't like how “they” need to be so “in-your-face” about it.

It's the television writer who says they oppose transphobia, but also perpetuate the stereotype of transwomen out to deceive straight men.
This writer, too, holds up Seth MacFarlane, famous chiefly for The Family Guy and Ted, as the canonical brogressive.[notes 5] MacFarlane has in fact been a vocal supporter of gay rights, and has been recognized as such by The Advocate, among others.[5] Darer judges the comedian for his use of colorful language and imagery and mocking play with stereotypes, accusing him of stomping where he should be treading tippy-toe:
“ ” MacFarlane ranted: “Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?”
Okay, multiple things here. First, this “radical” expression of support is founded on stereotypes, both of the impoverished (they are violent, unintelligent, animalistic, dirty, uncultured) and of the homonormative idea of the modern gay man (smart, artistic, urbane). Neither of these caricatures says anything about the experience of gay Americans. Furthermore, MacFarlane's weird invocation and marginalization of domestic violence feels deeply off-putting.[4] MacFarlane ranted: “Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?”Okay, multiple things here.

Wiktionary, the only online dictionary yet to feature the word, defines brogressive simply as pejorative slang meaning "a male progressive who downplays women's issues or displays a macho or patriarchal attitude." Among its sources, it cites a column by David Atkins, who paints a markedly different picture from the "intersectional feminists." He suggests instead that the term is exclusive to the online slacktivist Left:
“ ” Election work and party involvement is increasingly seen as the unhip, uncool, morally compromised province of social climbers and “brogressives” not truly committed to the supposedly “real work” of social justice engagement by non-electoral means.[6] Election work and party involvement is increasingly seen as the unhip, uncool, morally compromised province of social climbers and “brogressives” not truly committed to the supposedly “real work” of social justice engagement by non-electoral means.
Points to ponder [ edit ]
Examining the "brogressive" concept reveals odd insights into the mentality of people who would use the term. We're left wondering: If real world politics involves persuading lots of people to support your goals, whether in the streets or in the polls, how does this concept help with that aim?
Also, what did Seth MacFarlane ever do to them?

Notes [ edit ]
↑ The low man on the intersectional totem pole. ↑ Wow, a web page from the future! ↑ For what it's worth Julian Assange is not in Sweden. He fears going to Sweden, not so much for rape charges (dropped as of 2017), but rather for fear of being extradited to the United States, where he would likely face the Chelsea Manning treatment or worse ↑ Can such things be? ↑ As far as animated family sitcoms go, The Family Guy lacks the essential humanity of Mike Judge's King of the Hill. But no one will call Mike Judge a "brogressive".
Haussner's, alas, closed in 1999, and its amazing art collection was auctioned by Sotheby's for $10 million (Rod Stewart bought a painting). But its fat-clogged heart lives on in a few corners of the city, where the house specialty I ordered that night back in ‘86—sour beef with dumplings—still appears on menus.
This was the classiest place in the city, or it had been once. When Mad Men producers wanted to show Don Draper out on the town in Baltimore for an third-season episode, they sent him to Haussner's. Here's a 1961 promotional film of the place in its heyday:
On my first weekend in Baltimore, my uncle picked me up at my dorm and, by way of introducing me to the city, took me to an unforgettable restaurant called Haussner's. This was one of East Baltimore's time-worn German eateries, a huge space encrusted floor-to-ceiling with 19th-century paintings. The Germans dominated the local restaurant scene in the early 20th century, as they did in many American cities, and Haussner's was their most ornate redoubt. Its vast menu ranged from Teutonic fare like hasenpfeffer to overwrought “Continental” offerings in rich flour-thickened sauces. (Check out New York Public Library's digitized copy of a 1967 menu online .)
Sour beef is Baltimore-ized sauerbraten, a kind of German pickled pot roast. And autumn is its peak season, a time when corner bars and churches host sour-beef specials and weekend dinners. At the end of this month, historic Zion Lutheran Church, just a few steps from City Hall, throws the Woodstock of sour beef, a two-day event in which thousands of locals pack the German-speaking church's Adlersaal to load up on the stuff, plus beer and red cabbage.
You should go, but the best sour beef, in my experience, was the version made by longtime Baltimore magazine receptionist Marge Shaw, a daughter of East Baltimore who brought tubs of it into the office every October. Failing access to her kitchen, I make my own. The city's last old-school German restaurant, Eichenkrantz, closed its doors in 2015 (now the best place is the Old Stein Inn, over in Edgewater, near Annapolis). Sour beef survives, just barely. It turns up on the menus of first-ring suburban restaurants that cater to an older crowd, places like the Greek-owned Dmitiri's or time-warp joints like Johnny Dee's Lounge and the aptly called Sunset. It is there, amid the early-bird specials and strong Manhattans, that sour beef is making its last stand.
Variations abound—some are stew-y, others more like sliced meat bound in thick, glossy gravy—but they're all inevitably described as “an acquired taste.” The meat is marinated for days in a medieval-smelling mix of wine, vinegar, cloves, and other pickling spices. (I add juniper berries, because when else are you going to use the things?) Then it's seared and slow-roasted in its marinade, which turns into a beefy, mouth-puckering broth. The whole process reminds you that this was a technique devised for dealing with tough, gamey haunches of deer back in the Old Country. The final stage involves thickening the gravy with crushed gingersnaps, adding both a medicinal kick and sugary-sweet note atop the deep meaty-sourness. The potato dumplings—baby-fist-sized blobs of carb—float in this sea of massively over-seasoned sauce, soaking it all up.
It's…well, it's something. You can let it sit for a few days after you cook it, which lets it mellow a bit. But not much. Sour beef comes at you fast. What does it taste like? It tastes like EVERYTHING.
That's always been a hallmark of Baltimore's unsubtle culinary character, which tends to be a cuisine of Haussnerian excess and overkill. The city's more-famous signature dish, steamed blue crabs, operates on a similar principle, smothering delicate seafood in shovelfuls of Old Bay seasoning, a peppery concoction seemingly composed of everything in the spice drawer. This is powerful food, the kind that warms the soul and clobbers the senses. It's not a meal one wants to repeat immediately. But when it's time, it's perfect.

**************************************************As a Victorian, where could you turn to find information on curing a nosebleed, making medicines for dogs, entertaining your children, restoring your hair, polishing soldiers' buttons, concocting salad dressings, soothing a black eye, extracting teeth, and building a cheap aquarium? Your first port of call would probably have been your local pharmacist. One volume in the Archives of The Retreat offers a fascinating insight into the world of the Victorian pharmacist, and his customers. This volume, Medical and Domestic Formulae by a Pharmaceutical Chemist, is a notebook handwritten by a Retreat patient, Alfred Jones, and dedicated to the Medical Superintendent Dr Baker.Mr Jones clearly felt an affinity with Dr Baker, inscribing the first page of of his book with the words “Experientia Docet” - meaning ‘experience teaches' - and:These lines express a sense of a shared calling and a certain kind of equality between patient and doctor. The book also serves to show the pride a Pharmaceutical Chemist might take in his work and status in the late nineteenth century.Until 1842, chemists and druggists did not have to have a formal qualification. Anyone with sufficient funds could set up a shop and sell potentially lethal concoctions of drugs. Accidents with mis sold or wrongly made-up medicines gave the profession a bad name, leading to the formation of a group of pharmacists who wanted to protect their trade. Jacob Bell, the son of a Quaker pharmacist, quickly emerged as the spokesman for this group. Their greatest successes were the granting of the Royal Charter of Incorporation to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1843, and the 1868 Pharmacy Act, which meant that anyone make up medicines had to have taken the Society's examination, and had to be registered with the Society. For pharmacists like Alfred Jones, registration with the Society was a mark of status as a trusted individual within a local community, and as a privileged member of a wider medical community which would also include the Medical Superintendent of a Mental Hospital like The Retreat. Thus he writes that his book contains:Alfred Jones' notebook gives us an overview of the kinds of products people required from a pharmacist in the later nineteenth century, and how dangerous some of them might have been! A ‘Carmmative for Infants' included a large dose of laudanum, while a ‘Mixture for Excited Brain' (recommended for children as well as adults) contained bromide and chloral hydrate, a sedative. Just as unappealing is an ‘Indigestion Mixture' containing dilute nitro hydrochloric acid - a substance which can be highly corrosive if not sufficiently diluted.Another page recommends “Chloroform just short of anasthesia [sic] is the best treatment of Hydrophobia” in cases of diseases such as rabies. This would be another risky procedure, but probably safer than the alternative, which was to perform a tracheotomy. The Victorian pharmacist walked a fine line indeed!Some of the less harmful recipes in the book give us an insight into the realities of life beyond the pharmacist's shop, for example:In the nineteenth century, the local pharmacist would also provide cures and tonics for animals, reflecting a world in which working animals were a much greater part of the general public's everyday lives than they are today. Alfred Jones offers recipes for a ‘Cleansing Drink for Newly Calved Cow,' consisting of juniper berries, sulphur, aniseed, ginger, cumin seeds, Glaubers salt (sodium sulphate - used as a laxative in crystal form), and Epsom salts. He notes that, ‘some add 1/2 pt Linseed Oil. A different page gives ‘Alterative and Restorative Powder for Horses' and ‘Cough Balls for Horses,' reminding us of the ubiquity of the horse for transport at this time.The recipes also show a lighter side of life, however. For example, this idea for a children's entertainment:‘Magic Designs on a White Sheet Stretch a sheet & draw a design such as the Prince Wales's Feathers &c with a piece of Chalk & dust thereon lightly a penny packet of Aniline dye Red, Blue, or Any Colour. This is invisible at a distance but on spraying Methylated Spirit onto the sheet with a spray apparatus - it is instantly developed to the amusement of the youngsters.'The pharmacist also held a wealth of knowledge about food and drink, for which ingredients could be supplied. Alfred Jones offered recipes for ‘Sea Side Sauce', ‘American cocktail Bitters', Doncaster Butter Scotch, Ginger Wine, ‘Currie Powder' and Salad Dressing, as well as various jams and marmalades. In this book, some of these recipes sit rather incongruously beside much less appetising concoctions, for example ‘Currie Powder' (nutmeg, turmeric, “cummin seed,” cayenne, coriander, black pepper, ginger and mustard) is followed by ‘Cement for Glass, China &c' and ‘Insoluble Liquid Glue.”This volume, handwritten by a Retreat patient, is just one of the thousands of documents in the hospital's archive which can tell us about life outside the walls of the Retreat, as well as within. While there are some unusual additions (a poem entitled ‘Lines addressed to a Kitten' tucked into a page describing furniture polish and cold cream, for example), this book is a fascinating insight into the world of the Victorian pharmacist, and just one of the documents in the Retreat's archives which brings a lost world to life.

Raw bovine testicles in an Italian market
Rocky Mountain oysters, also known as prairie oysters in Canada (French: animelles), is a dish made of bull testicles. The organs are often deep-fried after being peeled, coated in flour, pepper and salt, and sometimes pounded flat. This delicacy is most often served as an appetizer.[1]
The dish is served in parts of Canada where cattle ranching is prevalent and castration of young male animals is common. "Prairie oysters" is the preferred name in Canada where they are served in a demi-glace.[2] In Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, they are often called calf fries. In Spain, Argentina and many parts of Mexico they are referred to as "criadillas," and they are colloquially referred to as huevos de toro (literally, "bull's eggs"; besides its literal meaning, huevos is a Spanish slang term for testicles) in Central and South America.[3] Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes confused with cattle fries or animelles (cattle testicles), which are served in a similar manner. A few other terms, such as "cowboy caviar", "Montana tendergroins", "dusted nuts", "swinging beef", or simply “mountain oysters” may be used.[4]
The dish, purportedly cowboy fare,[5] is most commonly found served at festivals, amongst ranching families, or at certain specialty eating establishments and bars.[4] They are, however, also readily available at some public venues (e.g., at Coors Field during Colorado Rockies baseball games). Eagle, Idaho, claims to have the "World's Largest Rocky Mountain Oyster Feed" during its Eagle Fun Days (now held the second weekend in July).[6] Clinton, Montana, Deerfield, Michigan, Huntley, Illinois, Olean, Missouri, Severance, Colorado, and Tiro, Ohio also hold testicle festivals.[7] Rocky Mountain oysters are sometimes served as a prank to those unaware of the origin of these "oysters". They are also considered to be an aphrodisiac by many people.[7]
The primary goal of testicle removal is not culinary. Castration in veterinary practice and animal husbandry is common and serves a variety of purposes, including the control of breeding, the growth of skeletal muscle suitable for beef, and temperament alteration.[8]
Similar dishes [ edit ]
Testicles from other animals can also be used in similar dishes. The most common is lamb fries (not to be confused with lamb's fry which is another term for liver of lamb) made with testicles from castrated sheep. In some cases, pig testicles are used as well to make "pig fries".
Another dish found on occasion is turkey fries made from turkey testes. These are sometimes known as "short fries" as well.

When SFX magazine spoke with Joss Whedon sometime last month, the Avengers: Age of Ultron writer/director was (and still is) in the editing process and nearing a final cut. "We're at the insane-o-stage," he said. "I think we're just about to come out of the insane-o-stage and into the 'Hey, this looks like a movie!' stage. I believe that it's starting to come together." He later spoke about the plot, which will see Earth's mightiest heroes deal with personal challenges as well as a maniacal robot. "What drives this story is the idea power and connection, and how the more you have of one the less you have of another," explained Whedon. "And the idea of heroes and whether or not that's a useful concept. I know it seems like we've heard that before but I feel that this movie makes an argument that is worth listening to. It's about damaged people, because guess what I like to write about! And it's about trying to find some kind of connection, because the Avengers are the most isolated people in the world. They're different to everyone else. They're richer, or stranger, or they're monsters or they're gods. Not one of them is really a part of the world. And this movie kind of drags them back down to Earth a little bit, which is both painful and exciting."
Speaking of "exciting," yesterday's trailer for Avengers: Age of Ultron teased plenty of fan service; from the team taking on a secret Hydra base, and the Hulk fighting Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor up a skyscraper, to the all-out war between the heroes and Ultron's army of drones. When asked if there is a moment in the much-anticipated Marvel sequel where he can ignore fan expectations and just take in the fan joy of the visuals he's bringing to the big-screen, Joss Whedon responded: "Oh, there's more than one! Honestly, we screened the movie last night, and just to sit down and watch it, which is not something you really get to do at this stage... I was like okay, some of this is the bomb. Some of this is really really lovely. The actors are killing it, the sequences are exciting, the editors are amazing and Ben Davis, who shot it, has made it a work of art. There are some hardcore action sequences in this but what's really grand is how the characters play through those. It's always got to be about the people. Not just the smaller moments, where they're talking alone, but the way they're interacting during the action is really exciting for me. I'm a people person unless I'm in an actual room with people." If you haven't already, be sure to pick up the latest issue of SFX, or stay tuned to CBM for more from Joss Whedon. What do you think?

Two months ago, the Bar Association in Diyarbakir, the largest city of Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast, received an application from an underage boy, who, on the advice of friends, sought refuge with the institution.
The teenager, whose name is withheld due to his receiving death threats, wrote along the following lines: “I was beaten by family members after they learned I was homosexual. After the beating, my father held a gun to my head, put a Quran in my hands and told me to repent. I somehow managed to run away the following day. My family stormed the homes of my friends and battered them, too. I have nowhere to take refuge. My life is in danger.”
Accompanied by lawyers, the teenager lodged complaints with the police and the prosecutor's office. Given the severity of the situation, he was placed in a child care institution in another city, with no information relayed to his family. He will stay there until he turns 18 and then finds a way to look after himself.
The teenager's story is heartbreaking, but he could still be considered lucky — for now — as many homosexuals in Turkey perish at the hands of their own relatives in “honor killings.”
Turkey became acquainted with the term “gay honor killing” in 2008 when The Independent used the expression in a report on the murder of Ahmet Yildiz, 26. Thereafter, Yildiz's murder came to be known as the first gay honor killing in Turkey. Yet, families are believed to have played a role in such murders even before the term was coined.
Ahmet Yildiz's murder
Yildiz was the only son of a wealthy, pious family from Urfa. He lived with his boyfriend in Istanbul, where he was a university student. When he began receiving threats from his family after they learned of his homosexuality, he lodged a criminal complaint and asked for protection. The prosecutor's office, however, not only failed to meet his request for protection but launched no investigation at all.
Yildiz's murder was foretold. On July 15, 2008, only three months after he lodged the complaint, three bullets pierced his flesh as he went out to buy ice cream from a cafe in Istanbul's Uskudar district. The family sought no legal action over the murder, and a court case was opened only upon the complaint of a woman who was injured in the attack. Witness testimonies depicted the assailant as the victim's father, Yahya Yildiz, but the police could not track him down, as he had already fled abroad.
It took years for an Istanbul court to heed the persistent requests of lawyers and ask Interpol to issue a search bulletin for Yahya. Six years later, the man remains on the run, believed to be either in Russia or Ukraine, where he had business connections. The last hearing in the case on April 29 was postponed until July on the grounds that the suspect was still missing.
The victim's lawyer, Firat Soyle, believes that Yahya is keeping contact with his family and can be tracked down if the communications of family members are monitored. The court has rejected such a request in 17 hearings, deadlocking Turkey's first gay honor killing case.
The Rosin Cicek case
Another gay honor killing claimed the life of Rosin Cicek, 17, murdered in a gruesome fashion in July 2012. His father and two uncles battered the teenager, fired 14 bullets in his head and body before dumping him on a roadside near Diyarbakir. The body was found two days later.
Cicek's father and two uncles were immediately arrested. Even though the suspects denied the accusations, the Diyarbakir prosecutor's office charged them with murder committed “with motives of hatred over the victim's sexual orientation.” On Feb. 10, a court in the city sentenced all three suspects to life in prison. The father's sentence was aggravated with no chance to parole.
Two murders, similar patterns
The similarities in these two gay honor killings reflect the cultural dynamics in Turkey vis-a-vis different sexual orientations.
In both murders, the families disowned the legal process. In the Yildiz case, the relatives, including the victim's mother, shunned the court hearings and denied information on the whereabouts of the father, the alleged murderer. In the Cicek case, the victim's mother and siblings attended the hearings but claimed the boy's death was an accident unrelated to his father and uncles, and even physically attacked LGBT activists who wanted to attend the trial. This type of behavior could suggest that the families condone the murders, seeing them as a normal response. Yet, it should be noted that they are under huge social pressure.
Ahmet Yildiz and Rosin Cicek were both from cities in southeastern Turkey, where prejudice against homosexuals has been on the rise in recent years under the impact of political factors. For instance, the Huda-Par Party — the offshoot of Turkish Hezbollah, an outlawed Islamist group unrelated to its Lebanese namesake — targeted homosexuals in a press statement in October 2013: "If they try to promote mental disorders and perverted behavior among Kurds as freedoms, they will pay the price." Such political attitudes targeting homosexuals directly are widespread in the region.
The LGBT community is seriously worried. LGBT advocacy groups closely followed the two trials and sought to become intervening parties in the proceedings. The courts rejected their requests.
In comments to Al-Monitor, attorney Soyle, who was involved in both cases, explained why LGBT participation in the court proceedings was important. “LGBT individuals are both upset and fearful over the murders. They know the same may happen to them. People who kill their own children can easily kill others of the same sexual identity. If courts grant them [LGBT activists] intervening party status, this could have a deterrence effect,” he said.
Soyle complained of the judiciary's stance on the murder of homosexuals. “The courts themselves create discrimination, they lack sensibility in the criminal cases. People who wish to follow the trials are seen as Martians,” he said.
“The draft law on hate crimes submitted to parliament should be passed as soon as possible, the term "sexual orientation" should be added to the constitutional article on equality and the laws should ensure that courts and public servants take the issue seriously,” he added.
Increasing the punishments for perpetrators is the first measure that comes to mind for stopping gay honor killings or hate crimes against homosexuals in general. Yet, the deterrence effect of heavier sentences is a contentious issue. What really matters is eradicating the motivation that leads the perpetrators to kill.
Turkey needs to take numerous measures to combat discrimination, hate speech and hate murders against LGBT individuals, especially gay honor killings. Otherwise, gay honor killings are likely to remain a festering sore.

Vector Not Raster
Before the MTS demonstration, McCauley explained why he thinks this cameraless approach is important. Primarily it's about range and cost.
McCauley said that while he was at Oculus and the company was working on their first camera-based system for the DK2, he quickly picked up on the range problem. The company had talked for a long time about room-scale capability, and McCauley didn't see the camera approach as sufficiently scalable to those distances. He explained that the range of a camera based approach is limited by the image sensor which is raster-based.
The Rift DK2 camera has a resolution of 752×480. The headset of a user sitting just a few feet away can only be seen by a small portion of those pixels (as the view of the headset only takes up a portion of the total pixels that comprise the scene). As you get further away, the headset is represented on fewer and fewer pixels which means the computer has much fewer data to work with, McCauley says.
You can think of it like this: if at 8 feet from the camera the headset only takes up 94×60 of the 752×480 sensor, it's essentially like trying to track the headset with a 94×60 pixel camera up close with the headset filling its entire field of view. The further away you move the headset, the lower resolution your camera becomes (in a sense); there's no effective means of zooming the camera in when the headset is at range so that it can use more of its image sensor.
Several tricks have been devised to counter this reduction in available pixels at range, like dynamically boosting the LED brightness to create a larger light source for the camera to spot, using the flashing of LEDs to glean additional information about the tracked object, and utilizing dynamic exposure of the camera. At a certain point however, the resolution of the camera-based tracking becomes the fundamental range-limiting factor.
The obvious fix then is to increase the resolution of the image sensor, but that racks up cost quickly and USB bandwidth becomes a bottleneck, McCauley says.
So he opted for a vector-based approach; one which would not be stuck with a set resolution, meaning that, in theory, it could track with equal precision at 5 feet or 50 feet. McCauley says that Kris Pister, the professor who pioneered the tracking algorithms in MTS, has used a similar system to track a drone in the air more than one mile away (though I would guess at that range we're far removed from the realm of ‘lasers you can legally point at a person').
Because MTS only has to stream the values of the angle of the laser, the solution is very low bandwidth compared to sending and processing a high resolution image at 60Hz or more, says McCauley.
Beyond Proof of Concept
The system isn't perfect. There were plenty of times where I saw it lose tracking, and it isn't integrated with any apps at this point so I wasn't able to actually look into a headset and see how precise the tracking was. But McCauley's goal is only to demonstrate the concept, and it appears he's well on the way. There's still tons of room for optimization to get the system working in tip-top shape. Ultimately though, he doesn't intend to be the purveyor of MTS.
“I'm gonna let someone else [commercialize it]. What I'm gonna do is put the system together to let someone else try to get this to work. I can get the components… the companies on board to provide the hardware to build the thing and get it debugging in some rudimentary form,” says McCauley. “But to get it actually integrated with an application? I don't ever intend to do that. I'm just going to make this thing to prove it can be done. That's the only interest I have.”
When I press him on this, he says he has no interest in spinning up a company for the technology. He seems happy to be taking a break after Oculus, and has plenty of work left to do on his Lola T70. But it doesn't sound quite like he's doing this as an academic endeavor, where he'll simply publish his findings for just anyone. Instead, McCauley is considering looking within his network to find the right partners to make MTS a reality.
“I have access to all the foundries and stuff and the silicon which is high value. And I have enough friends that if I say ‘that thing is gonna go' or ‘we're gonna do this', they'll be on board,” he tells me. “If you're at a small startup somewhere—even a medium sized startup—you'll have a tough time getting people to [take the risk on you to get this built]. All the engineering that goes into making this is an enormous expense, but it's already kind of done [referring to the foundries that craft the MEMS devices]… to get those kinds of resources is very hard to do for a small company but I'm pretty well connected.”
Cross at your own risk: San Francisco's most dangerous intersections
Image 1 of / 34 Caption Close Cross at your own risk: San Francisco's most dangerous intersections 1 / 34 Back to Gallery
San Francisco has been rated the second-most walkable city in the entire United States, bested only by New York.
But the great walking experience comes with a high price.
Sadly, San Francisco is also one of the most dangerous cities in the nation for pedestrians. From 2010-2016, there were 5,846 pedestrian collisions in the city, leaving 130 dead and more than 6,000 injured, according to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency.
A new study by the law firm of Walkup, Melodia, Kelly and Schoenberger, which teamed up with data visualization company 1Point21 Interactive, analyzed data from 45,000 collision reports in that time period.
It found that more than a sixth of all pedestrian collisions — resulting in 21 fatalities and 892 injuries — occurred at only 63 San Francisco intersections.
In most of those incidents, the driver of the vehicle, not the pedestrian, was at fault. Speeding and illegal turns were the key factors, according to the study.
The downtown Market Street corridor accounted for many of most dangerous intersections. The city's proposed Better Market Street overhaul of the corridor would ban private vehicles and add Muni lines on Market Street between 10th Street and the Embarcadero, presumably making the neighborhood safer for pedestrians. Some of the elements of the plan are already in place, but the city hopes to have a complete overhaul of Market Street done by 2022.
In the meantime, if you are on foot, be vigilant when crossing the street, especially in SoMa, the Mission District and the Tenderloin.
The above gallery shows San Francisco's most hazardous pedestrian intersections, according to Walkup, Melodia, Kelly and Schoenberger's study.

Rio de Janeiro: As the world watched the Rio Olympics opening ceremony taking place at Maracana Stadium on Friday night, a man was shot dead about 800 metres away.
His body was found with bullet wounds after 9pm. The man has not yet been identified but local news outlets reported the Brazilian had committed robberies in the area and was killed when one of his victims reacted.

He was found outside the gates of the Rio State University on Rua Sao Francisco Xavier, not far from the stadium where approximately 75,000 people watched Brazil put on its biggest ever show.
Police also cordoned off a large area around the beach volleyball arena in Copacabana, while ceremony was being staged. Half an hour later a member of the bomb disposal team was seen examining the packages with the cordon still in place.
Real Madrid's title success has completed the lineup of seeds for next season's Champions League group stage draw.
Zinedine Zidane's side beat Malaga 2-0 to edge out Barcelona in La Liga, and they will be seeded along with the champions of the major leagues across Europe.
Bayern Munich, Juventus, Benfica, Chelsea, Monaco, Spartak Moscow are in the top pot by right, while Ukraine champions Shakhtar Donetsk are promoted to pot 1 as the position held for the holders -- Juve or Real Madrid -- will not be used.
Pots 2 to 4 are based on UEFA club coefficient over the last five years. There will be a strong collection of teams in the second pot, with Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund, Man City and Porto assured of their places.
They will be joined in pot 2 by Sevilla and Manchester United if they respectively come through the qualifying round and win the Europa League. Napoli and Tottenham Hotspur respectively could benefit if they lose and move up from Pot 3.
At present Roma face being in Pot 4, though will move up to Pot 3 if a seeded team loses in the playoffs.

At any given time in history, most people are oblivious to what is happening because they are focused on what has just happened. They are after all doing what is normally the smart thing in civilization, which is to look at what has succeeded and emulate it.
Their problem is that the events that transpire are the result of an ongoing process, so any time you emulate those events, you have missed the timeless part (the process) in favor of a signal of its existence, a result specific to a certain time that has now passed. We can see this in current politics.
Most people out there are following the cues they get from movies and pop stars. These people suggest that the same values that people trotted out in 1968 are still valid. Even more, they hint, the only way to stand out in a crowd is to be different, progressive, fair-minded etc. by accepting this stuff.
But even the 1968 values were backward-looking. A society wracked by two hot wars and a cold one was scanning over its past mistakes, trying to find an easy way out. It took many years for people to realize the situation was not as simple as appearances suggested, and that a solution would require not dodging unresolved issues but tackling them head-on.
However, in 2011, the 1968 values endorsed by politicians, entertainment figures and television commercials are even more backward-looking. Those endorsing them are looking for symbols of the hip, the young, the good and the exciting. They can't invent something new; they need something we already know.
And so the propaganda rolls on. Any time they want to sell a car, for example, as being hip and young, they trot out the same stuff and hope we all jump at the mention of something so obviously socially promoted. Yet because they're looking backward, they're missing the real story.
A new report from the Military Leadership Diversity Commission says yes. It argues that the battle lines in Afghanistan and Iraq have been so blurry that women basically are in combat, but don't get the formal combat credit needed to advance in rank. That's because of a 1994 Pentagon ban — the so-called “combat exclusion rule” — that keeps females out of small units where most combat takes place. The rule should be junked, the commission says. The panel, created by Congress in 2009, spent 18 months coming up with ways for the Pentagon to improve the promotion of women and minorities as the nation becomes increasingly diverse. “The armed forces,” it warned Monday, “have not yet succeeded in developing a continuing stream of leaders who are as demographically diverse as the nation they serve.” – Time
The writers of this article, and this report, are attempting to be good guys. They want us to think that they're including everyone and being fair to everyone equally, so they're on the side of the right and progressive. There's only one problem: their crusade has absolutely no bearing on the quality of our armed forces, e.g. can they win wars.
It's like being at a job where they insist the new client team have members from every floor. While that makes the team more representative of the workplace, it has zero bearing on how well it performs. Often the best teams don't represent the organization behind them faithfully, but show a specialized ability. Even more, other factors determine the effectiveness of the team: its organization, training, equipment and direction.
1968-logic is to make a shiny happy symbol out of everything. Make sure everyone is included. Results? — err, not our department. We need to make everything fair, everything new and exciting, everything different. The rest will work itself out, or not, but at least we did the right thing, and gained social popularity, votes or product buys from it.
Social democratic parties across Europe are losing elections on an “unprecedented scale”, according to former foreign secretary David Miliband. He said the parties were “fragmenting as the right is unifying”. He named six countries â€“ Britain, Sweden, Germany, France, Holland and Italy â€“ that he said had a “good claim to represent the historic heartland of European social democracy”, but that are no longer run by the centre-left. “Not since the first world war has there been this kind of domination from the right. The whole era of democratic suffrage,” said Miliband. – The Guardian
How could this be? The right wing is future-oriented, even if it uses the methods of the past. The right cares about results, and about having goals in common, where the left is about individualism and fond notions that may or may not be true but sure are interesting.
While they want you to think that leftist thought is new and exciting, the truth is that it's old. Not only is it a calcified ruin held over from 1968, chaperoned by the now white-haired burnt-out hippies who tell us in drooling repetitive detail about their glorious victories, but also, it's irrelevant. We face a new world in which no absolute morality exists, or even any shared culture. Instead, people want results and stability.
Let one of the leading thinkers of the 1990s, who proclaimed that liberal democracy had taken us to the final stage in history before recanting that progressive Utopian theory, show us what's replacing our “moral” and social judgments:
Dr. Fukuyama, a political scientist, is concerned mostly with the cultural, not biological, aspects of human society. But he explicitly assumes that human social nature is universal and is built around certain evolved behaviors like favoring relatives, reciprocal altruism, creating and following rules, and a propensity for warfare. Because of this shared human nature, with its biological foundation, â€œhuman politics is subject to certain recurring patterns of behavior across time and across cultures,â€ he writes. It is these worldwide patterns he seeks to describe in an analysis that stretches from prehistoric times to the French Revolution. Previous attempts to write grand analyses of human development have tended to focus on a single causal explanation, like economics or warfare, or, as with Jared Diamondâ€™s â€œGuns, Germs and Steel,â€ on geography. Dr. Fukuyamaâ€™s is unusual in that he considers several factors, including warfare, religion, and in particular human social behaviors like favoring kin. – NYT
In the past, we took one thing out of thousands and called it a cause; more accurately, it would be called a symbol of that cause, or a subset of factors representing all other factors.
Now we need to look at multiple causes at once and figure out that rather than being puppets to whatever political aspect strikes our fancy, nations are organic. They operate as a result of multiple causes and with multiple results, simultaneously.
This negates the idea that a social or symbolic factor could trump all others. Morality and popularity are just one factor of many, and they are explained by other things. Morality is a means to an end for these civilizations; they decide what they want, and backfill the moral charge to make it stick.
For those in 1968, or even in 1996, this would have been unthinkable. It's a reversal of all they have worked for, which is a moral society, and replaces it instead with a practical society that adapts to realistic expectations of the world in response to its actions. Such a society is consequentialist, or concerned with results more than feelings/popularity/symbolism.
Time has marched on, yet many people remain stranded in 1968-think, probably because they're accustomed to using the 1960s as a marketing flavor. Want it to be edgy? Put Bob Dylan on it, or Jane Fonda if you dare. Want it to be fun? Led Zeppelin or hippies with a giant doobie. Profound? John Lennon or Pink Floyd.
It's just like adding a little cream flavor to your cheap bread and calling it “Dutch style,” or covering a normal chair in chrome and calling it “urban style.” It is just as false as the advertising we distrust, the speeches of politicians we know are lies, and the little white lies people tell in social situations that we know are false (the stripes do make you, or anyone else, look fat).
A whole generation is about to be caught unawares as they continue to spout the hide-bound, calcified and stale ideas of the past and insist they are new. We have real problems instead:
Government payoutsâ€”including Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insuranceâ€”make up more than a third of total wages and salaries of the U.S. population, a record figure that will only increase if action isnâ€™t taken before the majority of Baby Boomers enter retirement. Even as the economy has recovered, social welfare benefits make up 35 percent of wages and salaries this year, up from 21 percent in 2000 and 10 percent in 1960, according to TrimTabs Investment Research using Bureau of Economic Analysis data. â€œThe U.S. economy has become alarmingly dependent on government stimulus,â€ said Madeline Schnapp, director of Macroeconomic Research at TrimTabs, in a note to clients. â€œConsumption supported by wages and salaries is a much stronger foundation for economic growth than consumption based on social welfare benefits.â€ – CNBC
Our economy is a circular Ponzi scheme. We depend on importing new workers and paying them nothing so we can all rise, and then pay everyone through the government, robbing the active parts of the economy to put money directly in the hands of the citizens, who spend it in ways that generate no further wealth. Dead ending it, in other words.
The result is predictable:
Cities across America are facing dire financial distress. Meredith Whitney, a banking analyst turned independent adviser who correctly predicted the banking meltdown, has issued an Armageddon-like prediction of mass municipal defaults. Others â€” notably Newt Gingrich â€” have suggested that state governments as well as cities should be allowed to file for bankruptcy. Congress held a hearing to examine the idea. These forecasts of apocalypse have touched a nerve. Americans, still reeling from the devastating impact of the mortgage debacle, are fearful that the next economic disaster is only a matter of time. To anyone reading the headlines of budget deficits and staggering pension liabilities, it takes little imagination to conclude that the next big one will be government itself. The problems of cities are everywhere. – NYT
These are real problems. They are bigger than economics; you don't get into such radical debt spending unless you're also having trouble with leadership, or at least leaders who refuse to make the tough decisions and instead pander to the crowd by offering “free” bonanzas. These problems are the sign of a civilization veering out of control, careening off the walls of its own problems, yet unable to plot a course away from inevitable collision.
And yet the people who are accustomed to getting popular, rich and acclaimed by pandering to us using the played-out symbols of the past keep at it. They keep hitting us up with that 1968 symbolism, forgetting that most of us were not alive back then and have no allegiance to being hippies, at least if we've seen past the marketing and realize being a hippie doesn't make us cool, it makes us a perfect consumer.
On the tapes, Schiller wastes little time before attacking conservatives. The Republican Party, Schiller says, has been â€œhijacked by this group.â€ The man posing as Malik finishes the sentence by adding, â€œthe radical, racist, Islamaphobic, Tea Party people.â€ Schiller agrees and intensifies the criticism, saying that the Tea Party people arenâ€™t â€œjust Islamaphobic, but really xenophobic, I mean basically they are, they believe in sort of white, middle-America gun-toting. I mean, itâ€™s scary. Theyâ€™re seriously racist, racist people.â€ Schiller goes on to describe liberals as more intelligent and informed than conservatives. â€œIn my personal opinion, liberals today might be more educated, fair and balanced than conservatives,â€ he said. – Daily Caller
It would be threatening if it weren't so simplistic. He's used to saying such things and having a crowd of people applaud him, so he keeps saying them, like everyone else whose acquaintance he has made. Even more, he will refuse to get to know someone who feels differently, so it's the only perspective he'll see.
And right now, the circular favoritism continues unabated. But it is a small group, and while they keep themselves occupied, the world is pulling away from the tired and washed-out ideas of 1968. It's not enough to just call your opposition racists anymore; you need a practical plan instead.
If history follows the usual patterns, these folks will keep bleating the same obsolete dogma up until they are removed from power by popular will or political crisis. They have shut their minds, and are using expired symbols to manipulate each other, but are not looking to the road ahead. The future belongs to those who can focus on that path.

The animated film The Little Prince, which has performed well overseas and was a record-breaker in France where it won the Best Animated Film prize at the Cesar Awards, will not bow next Friday in the U.S. via Paramount as had been the plan. Director Mark Osborne (Kung Fu Panda) took to Twitter today to break the news that the studio in fact was not going to distribute the move at all.
The studio declined comment this afternoon but confirmed the news.
1/3 Many thanks to everyone for the outpouring of love and support in these strange times. — Mark Osborne (@happyproduct) March 12, 2016
2/3 – As it turns out, the much anticipated U.S. release of this special and unique film will have to be anticipated just a little bit more. — Mark Osborne (@happyproduct) March 12, 2016
3/3 – All I can say is #thelittleprince will in fact be released by another distributor later this year. — Mark Osborne (@happyproduct) March 12, 2016
4/4 – Until then, head to Canada! The film opens there in wide release this weekend! — Mark Osborne (@happyproduct) March 12, 2016
Paramount had U.S. rights to the pic, based on the classic tale of the same name by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Paul Rudd, Ricky Gervais, James Franco, Mackenzie Foy and Benicio Del Toro voiced roles, and it even was slotted for its U.S. premiere as the opening-night film of last month's Santa Barbara Film Festival. It bowed at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.
In France, Le Petit Prince become France's top animated export in two decades, grossing $67.5M around the world before its U.S. premiere. The film did bow this weekend in Canada via eOne.
Osborne also tweeted that another distributor will come aboard for a 2016 release. Stay tuned.
On Sunday's Meet the Press, Chuck Todd hosted a panel featuring The Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel, The New York Times's Thomas Friedman, the American Enterprise Institute's Daniella Pletka, and Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher to discuss Russia, Jeff Sessions, and President Trump's comments regarding Obama.
During the panel, Pletka and Strassel kept pushing back against the media and the Democrats' weak case about Russian influence in the election as well as Russian influence within the Trump camp. Here's part of the transcript of the conversation:
DANIELLE PLETKA: It's not just the Russians who want to interfere in our election. Lots of countries want to interfere in our elections. Lots of countries have historically tried. Remember the Chinese and Al Gore? Right. That's not the point. The point is, was there somebody inside the Trump campaign who was working with them, and did the president know about that? And were they successful? And I think on those latter two questions, we have no idea. KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: No evidence. There's no evidence. I mean this is-- I just heard Chuck Schumer suggest exactly what you, that we know that this is the case. Look, there's nothing there. Especially this recent discussion about Jeff Sessions, which is the kind of height of the ludicrousness of this, okay? If Jeff Sessions really was a mole working for the Russian government, he probably would have found a better place to have met within than his public Senate office surrounded by his aides. So the meetings are not necessarily what matter. They don't prove anything. The question is-- CHUCK TODD: But the one thing, Kim, I will say-- KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: --is there any substance? CHUCK TODD: --this on these meetings is-- KIMBERLEY STRASSEL: Is there any substance?
While Todd and Belcher kept trying to push the seemingly baseless narrative, Thomas Friedman chimed into the conversation, admitting that there is no evidence of such collusion between the Russians and the Trump camp. Nevertheless, that did not stop Friedman from calling for a special prosecutor or an independent commission from looking into the matter despite the lack of credible proof. He also brought up Trump's tax returns, which happens to be Senator Chris Murphy's favorite chew toy.
THOMAS FRIEDMAN: I agree, there is no evidence, which is why we need a special prosecutor or an independent commission to get to the bottom of it. CORNELL BELCHER: Well-- THOMAS FRIEDMAN: And we need to see Trump's tax returns.
Watch that exchange below:
Even though Attorney General Sessions made the correct call in recusing himself from any investigation into the Trump campaign, that does not negate the fact that a special prosecutor or an independent commission will only be necessary when a fact-finder finds credible evidence of collusion. However, Friedman moronically believes that the Department of Justice or another independent body should waste precious time, money, and effort on an investigation based off circumstantial proof in the hope of promulgating a shoddy leftist agenda.
"I agree, there is no evidence, which is why we need a special prosecutor or an independent commission to get to the bottom of it." Thomas Friedman
Then again, what else should we expect from a man who believed China's one-party autocratic and dictatorial government was "led by a reasonably enlightened group of people" that "impose[s] the politically difficult but critically important policies needed to move a society forward in the 21st century"?

“If you don't have hot flashes until you've stopped menses, then you won't have them as long,” said Nancy Avis, a professor of social sciences and health policy at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the study's first author. “If you start later, it's a shorter total duration and it's shorter from the last period on.”
Hot flashes, which can seize women many times a day and night — slathering them in sweat, flushing their faces — are linked to drops in estrogen and appear to be regulated by the hypothalamus in the brain. Studies have found that women with hot flash symptoms also face increased risk of cardiovascular problems and bone loss.
Researchers followed the women in the study, who came from seven American cities, from 1996 to 2013. All of them met the researchers' definition for having frequent symptoms: hot flashes or night sweats at least six days in the previous two weeks.

None had had a hysterectomy or both ovaries removed, and none were on hormone therapy. (If they started taking hormone therapy during the study period, their data stopped being included, Dr. Avis said.)
Although some smaller studies have also found that symptoms can last many years, the new research drew praise from experts because, among other things, it included a larger and much more diverse group of women. One-third of them were African-Americans in Pittsburgh, Boston, Chicago and Ypsilanti, Mich. It also included women of Japanese descent in Los Angeles; women of Chinese descent in Oakland, Calif.; and Hispanic women in Newark — about 100 in each group.
“It's such a real-world study of women we are seeing day in and day out,” said Dr. Risa Kagan, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Sutter East Bay Medical Foundation in Berkeley. “There is no other study like this.”
Researchers found significant differences between ethnic groups. African-Americans reported the longest-lasting symptoms, continuing for a median of 10.1 years — twice the median duration of Asian women's symptoms. The median for Hispanic women was 8.9 years; for non-Hispanic whites, 6.5 years.

As filming for Alien: Covenant is now underway, Danny McBride has come forward to shed light on his role and praise the movie's "incredible" sets.
In an interview with Rolling Stone, McBride revealed that he stars as the pilot of a colonization ship called the Covenant, "searching for a planet where we might start life anew."

When asked about his experience on set, the actor said he isn't in front of a green screen all day, as "most of the stuff is practical effects," adding that "when you're running from an alien it's really a dude in an alien suit coming after you."
McBride praised the sets, saying they're so impressive that they don't require the actor to use much of your own imagination, recalling a specific instance in which they "go through some inclement weather at one point on the spaceship and this whole gigantic set is on a gimbal, shaking up and down."
He also spoke highly of Ridley Scott, saying he loves the director's energy and how quickly he moves through filming, doing no more than a few takes on any one particular scene.
Alien: Covenant opens in theaters on August 4, 2017 and is targeting a "pretty hard R" rating. For more on Scott's sci-fi thriller, check out this sneak peek at Katherine Waterston's new character. And to celebrate one of the franchise's entries, Aliens, and its 30th anniversary, a reunion panel featuring Sigourney Weaver and James Cameron will be held at San Diego Comic-Con.

Sweden's Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) says that the number of unaccompanied children arriving during the first two weeks of the year matches the number that came throughout the whole of January 2014.
Last year, 7049 children came to Sweden and sought asylum without a parent, guardian or older sibling - an increase of more than 80 percent on 2013. Sweden's Refugee Agency had predicted that around 4100 children would arrive.
Most of the refugees are fleeing violence in Syria and Eritrea.
On Tuesday, Ronny Magnusson from Sweden's Migration Agency told Swedish broadcaster SVT that it was “difficult” to make predictions for the year ahead and stressed that no matter now many children arrived, they would all be looked after.
“We have to take care of them….County administrative boards are negotiating with local authorities to increase the number of places for these children,” he added.
Sweden has one of the most liberal refugee policies in Europe, with 50,235 people seeking asylum there in the past three years.
Sweden currently takes in more refugees per capita than any other European country and the Swedish government has pledged 1,200 resettlement places.
All of Sweden's major political parties support the continued acceptance of large numbers of refugees, with the exception of the nationalist anti-immigration Sweden Democrat party, which won 13 percent of the vote in the last general election in September 2014.
A survey of 1,500 Swedes by polling service Novus in the same month as the election showed 34 percent were in favour of receiving fewer refugees, while 28 percent wanted more, and 32 percent considered the current level appropriate.
We all know that Microsoft is working on the next version of HoloLens, but so far Microsoft has not officially spoken about it. Today, Microsoft Research team revealed some information about the upcoming HoloLens hardware. The next version of HoloLens will feature the second version of the HPU that will include an AI coprocessor to natively and flexibly implement Deep Neural Networks, able to run resnet18 real-time on the device.
This means that upcoming HoloLens can analyze what the user sees and hears on the device instead of wasting time by sending the data to the cloud for processing. At an event in Honolulu today, Harry from MSR team showed an early spin of the second version of the HPU. This new AI chip will support a wide variety of layer types and HoloLens team can customise it to their needs. The AI coprocessor can run continuously, off the HoloLens battery, allowing features such as more sophisticated hand tracking with hand-part segmentation (demonstrated below in a video recorded by an attendee) and on-device voice recognition without having to send samples to the cloud.
“This is just one example of the new capabilities we are developing for HoloLens, and is the kind of thing you can do when you have the willingness and capacity to invest for the long term, as Microsoft has done throughout its history. And this is the kind of thinking you need if you're going to develop mixed reality devices that are themselves intelligent. Mixed reality and artificial intelligence represent the future of computing, and we're excited to be advancing this frontier,” wrote Marc Pollefeys, Director of Science, HoloLens.
Microsoft HoloLens is made up of specialized components like Holographic Processing Unit that makes light work of processing a large amount of data per second. You can read more about Holographic Processing Unit (HPU) here.
On a related note, I can't wait to hear about the improved optical stack in the next version of HoloLens. I really hope we will see HoloLens with improved field of view.
If big trades are any indicator, then June 27, 2014, marked the day the Anaheim Ducks got serious about bringing a second Stanley Cup to Orange County.
General manager Bob Murray shipped Nick Bonino, Luca Sbisa and the 24th overall pick in the 2014 draft to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for the coveted two-way center Ryan Kesler.
For Kesler, it also marked a shift in tone, telling ESPN, “I'm going to Anaheim to win a championship, that's going to be my sole goal, and my team's sole goal.”
Bold, perhaps brash, words for a player who had yet to set foot in his new team's locker room.
The Kesler deal, like any trade of its magnitude, was met with both skepticism and praise. Anaheim finally had its true second line center, yet had incurred a massive salary on a player coming off his worst offensive season in years.
In Murray's eyes, it was a risk worth taking, believing that Kesler's multi-faceted game could elevate his team to greater heights.
As far as team results go, the Kesler-era Ducks have been fairly successful. They took the eventual Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks to a Game 7 in the Western Conference Final. They've made up for a tough start to 2015-16 by going on an absolute tear that now has them within three points of the Pacific-leading Los Angeles Kings.
How much of that is Kesler's doing though? After all, he potted a rather unimpressive 20 goals last year and currently has a pedestrian 11 tallies through 56 games.
Don't be fooled by the dip in goal-scoring; Kesler plays a major role on this resurgent Anaheim team, one that he's grown into quite well.
Kesler 2.0(?)
http://gty.im/497305246
The former Olympian has always had a reputation as a premier two-way center. That description was absolutely warranted from roughly 2008 to 2011. Skating on those dominant Vancouver teams, Kesler recorded two 70-point seasons and even lit the lamp 41 times in 2010-11, the year that the Canucks went all the way to the Stanley Cup Final.
Kesler's production has consistently dipped since that magical year, and it's safe to say that he will never recapture that form. Unfortunately, that takes him out of the “elite two-way center” conversation.
That's perfectly fine.
Anaheim has taken on a defensive identity to turn its season around (just ask Mark Giordano), and Kesler has been at the helm of it.
Not only does he face the oppositions' best players on a nightly basis, but he starts an overwhelming majority of his shifts in the defensive zone.
To boot, he's logging one of the best relative possession ratings among Anaheim forwards.
Having a positive impact on possession in spite of some heavy defensive responsibilities is astonishing, especially considering all the miles on Kesler's body, thanks to some deep playoff runs throughout his career.
To say that Kesler is declining would be a bit inaccurate: though he's regressed in areas that are certainly important (scoring freaking goals), he's transformed into an extremely serviceable defensive center.
It's the mark of a player who's accepted what he has to offer at this stage in his career, espousing the “win at all costs” mentality that he preached upon his arrival in Southern California.
Though Kesler may have sounded a bit brash laying out what he intended to do in Anaheim, those words may instead sound prophetic if he can continue this level of play through the postseason.
Under ObamaCare, churches are already off the hook for covering things like contraception for their employees. They don't have to do it.
But what about companies like Hobby Lobby, that are owned by religious people?
What about religious universities like Wheaton College? Do they have to cover birth control for their faculty members?
Yesterday, the Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius announced the final version of a compromise between non-profit religious groups and the government:
In short: Religious employers at non-profits (like religious colleges) would not have to pay for things like birth control which they (wrongly) think causes abortions. But their employees would still receive free access to contraception through a third-party insurance provider. So women wouldn't have to suffer just because their employers want to push their religious views on everyone who works for them.
Sounds like, well, a compromise.
So why are religious groups so upset? The New York Times put it succinctly:
Under the rule, women are to have access to contraceptives without any premium, deductible, co-payment or other fees. Some religious employers do not want their employees to have coverage of contraceptives, even if someone else pays for it. … Under this [compromise], a nonprofit religious employer must notify its insurer that it objects to contraceptive coverage. The insurer must then notify people in the health plan that it will arrange or pay for contraceptive services as long as they remain in the health plan.
That's like a vegetarian boss getting mad because someone just offered everyone in the office gift certificates to the Olive Garden.
Anna Higgins of the Family Research Council thinks this new rule is a violation of her rights… somehow:
“Family Research Council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life-ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered, with no copay, by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections. The accounting gimmick HHS continues to require fails to satisfy the religious freedom protections that exist in other current laws and in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.”
So she's upset because religious employers will still have to indirectly cover women's health, because their insurers will let women know they still have access to contraception even if the employers won't pay for it.
Meanwhile, the Secular Coalition for America is pissed off because this lets religious employers get off easy:
“This disappointing rule change sets a terrible precedent for religious interference in individual choice,” said Edwina Rogers, Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America. “This exemption gives employers the ability to impose their particular religious beliefs on employees, infringing on the religious freedom of potentially millions of Americans.”
Hobby Lobby, not a non-profit and therefore not part of the new exemptions, is still suing to make sure their employees have no access to contraception whatsoever. While an Appeals Court has said they don't have to pay a fine for the time being, I absolutely loved this line from one of the judges:
“Hobby Lobby and Mardel have drawn a line at providing coverage for drugs or devices they consider inducing abortions, and it is not for us to question whether the line is reasonable,” the judges wrote. “The question here is not whether the reasonable observer would consider the plaintiffs complicit in an immoral act, but rather how the plaintiffs themselves measure their degree of complicity.”
Paraphrased: These people believe things that make no sense at all… but their level of delusion isn't on trial here.
At least the ACLU is supportive of the new rules:
“Today's announcement is a win for civil liberties,” said Sarah Lipton-Lubet, American Civil Liberties Union policy counsel. “With this rule, the administration continues to stand by women and our families and refuses to let employers use religion to discriminate. As the fight over the contraception rule moves through the courts, the ACLU will continue to stand up for the right to make decisions about birth control based on our own beliefs, not our bosses'.”
Some religious employers won't be satisfied until they have complete control over the sex lives of their employees. The Obama administration may have given religious groups more exemptions than they deserve, but they're making sure women employed by religious fanatics in non-profits and hospitals and schools aren't subject to archaic, harmful ideas of what health care should be limited to. We can celebrate that without giving them a pat on the back over how they achieved it.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's antitrust watchdog said on Friday it was imposing a 3 million-euro ($3.3 million) fine on messaging service WhatsApp for allegedly obliging users to agree to sharing their personal data with its parent company Facebook (FB.O).
All 28 European Union data protection authorities asked WhatsApp last year to stop sharing users' data with Facebook due to doubts over the validity of users' consent.
The Italian agency said the application led users to believe they would not have been able to continue using the service unless they agreed to terms including sharing personal data.
A spokesperson for WhatsApp said in an emailed comment: “We're reviewing the decision and we look forward to responding to officials.”
The fine is lower than the maximum 5 million euros the agency could have levied.
The Italian agency said it had also found other aspects of WhatsApp's terms of use were unfair, including allowing for unexplained interruptions to service and only the provider having the right to terminate the agreement.

Legendary Sci-Fi Author Joe Haldeman Tells the Story Behind 'The Forever War'
Joe Haldeman's guest panel at Escape Velocity 2017 started with a short, sweet introduction from Charles Hildebrant, from the Museum of Science Fiction: "It's not often you get to meet the inventor of a genre, but you are today."
Joe Haldeman established the military science fiction genre with his landmark book The Forever War, which tells the story of William Mandella, who is drafted into an elite interstellar military unit to fight an alien race called the Taurans. In his talk, Haldeman recounted his experiences in Vietnam, his journey as a writer, and the story behind the book.
Cleaning Test Tubes in Vietnam
Haldeman started with his enlistment in the 1960s. The Vietnam War was in full swing, and Haldeman had been sticking to college to avoid being drafted. "I had this idea that war was something that you absolutely had to stay away from." Still, he decided that he could mitigate the damage of being sent to war if he could get a specific assignment. He went to the recruitment office and signed up to be a scientific assistant, which he imagined would amount to cleaning test tubes in an army lab.
What the recruiter didn't tell him was that he'd have to "go to Vietnam and kill people before they kill you before you get to clean your test tubes."
Strangely enough, the Vietnam War ended up furnishing Haldeman with life experience he'd never had. According to him, "I didn't know what country I was leaving…I learned about physics and astronomy and mathematics…but I never learned about the real world."
Haldeman ended up coming back from the war with 27 wounds and a deep well of memories and experiences, which he poured into his fiction. "I didn't realize what a great existential advantage I was getting," he said. "Basically, all my science fiction buddies helped me recover from all my existential problems…my whole combat experience was completely ameliorated by my science fiction experience."
Even before Haldeman had left for Vietnam, he knew he wanted to be a writer. "I was a science fiction fan before I was an American citizen," he said. "I never lost sight of wanting to write this modern science fiction war novel…I was just the guy who came at the right time."
The Writing of 'The Forever War'
When Haldeman started writing short stories for fantasy and sci-fi magazines, there were 27 publications to choose from. One of the high points in his writing career came when he looked at a newsstand and found that seventeen of those twenty-seven F&SF magazines had one of his stories in them.
After completing the Iowa Writing Workshop, Haldeman walked away with the first chapter of a new novel. After figuring out a title with his brother, the name The Forever War was born. The novel was unique in the fact that it was a war story at heart, but not explicitly right-wing, like most similar works of the time.
The theme of The Forever War became, in the words of Haldeman, "dealing with people who are fundamentally different from you [in terms of] appetites, tastes, philosophies, who still have to work together."
The novel features female characters, addresses the separation of the military from the rest of society, and deals with homosexuality, elements that Haldeman took directly from his time in Vietnam and his thoughts about the war. After meeting two homosexual medics during his tour, he decided that he wanted his writing to feature people from across the spectrum of American military life, commenting "These guys are as real as I am."
When talking about the influences on the book, Haldeman noted that he "grew up in this humanistic, anti-establishment tradition of science fiction writers," and that he was "influenced by his generation's desire to change the world."
The Struggle to Publish
Haldeman notes that at the time he was pitching The Forever War to publishers, science-fiction war stories were "very, very right-wing, very masculine, [had] no sex and a very heavy God influence." Instead of trying to fit into that mold, Haldeman decided not to pay attention to what came before. That ended up causing major problems with his publishing prospects-he recalls coming into his agent's office, where he was shown a small index card of all seventeen of the publishers who had rejected The Forever War.
At one point, an editor sat him down and said "Joe, listen, some genres don't mix. Sci-fi does not mix with women," a comment directed at the inclusion of female characters in the book.
After the realization that his book was most likely doomed to failure, Haldeman attended the Nebula Award banquet, where he "pissed and moaned" to the gathered sci-fi and fantasy editors about his struggles. Eventually, he was cornered by Ben Bova, another sci-fi author, who reassured him that the story was worth telling. After some wrangling, the book was picked up by St. Martin's Press.
From there, Haldeman said the book was an "average" commercial success, but met with a big critical response. The Forever War began to pick up momentum, and to this day it has never gone out of print.
Science Fiction and Literary Fiction: Painting Stripes on a Giraffe
After Haldeman had finished speaking at the event, the floor was opened for questions. I stood up and said something like this:
"When I went through college, I got my degree in creative writing, and my professors were adamant that literary and genre fiction existed on opposite sides of a wall. Do you think it's a good thing to subject fantasy and sci-fi to literary, academic standards?"
Haldeman responded with "If you paint a giraffe with stripes, is it a tiger?"
Some folks in the audience laughed. "It seems so artificial," he commented. "You write a book in the hopes that people will read it, and that they'll be affected by it," he went on. "[If you write a book for both a literary and general audience], you end up writing the book for different people, who want different things from it."
From there, he hearkened back to the famous Peter Graham quote, which says that the 'Golden Age' of sci-fi is twelve years old: "I'm still a kid sitting in a corner with a book, trying to keep my mother from giving chores to me. I have a World War II jungle tent…I used to hide in there [as a kid]. I would [hang it] between two trees, take armloads of science fiction and read them in the tent. That was my education as a reader, writer, [and] person."
I thought that was a great answer.

José Ramón Machado Ventura, Party second secretary and a vice president of the Councils of State and Ministers, yesterday afternoon, February 16, received Tong Thi Phong, a member of the Communist Party of Vietnam's (PCV) Central Committee Political Bureau and a vice president of the National Assembly Standing Committee, who is leading a delegation invited to our country by the Cuban National Assembly of People's Power.
In a fraternal environment, the leaders exchanged experiences in their party and legislative work, also discussing progress in the implementation of Vietnam's renovation process and the updating of Cuba's economic model of socialist development.
Both leaders reaffirmed their interest in continuing to strengthen the historic relations shared by the two parties, governments, and peoples.
Salvador Valdés Mesa, Political Bureau member and a Council of State vice president, participated in the meeting, as well.
Also present on the Vietnamese side were Nguyen Van Giau, member of the PCV Central Committee and of the National Assembly Standing Committee; Nguyen Trung Thanh, the country's ambassador in Havana; and other members of the delegation.
Cody and I have been working on our Computer Engineering senior project for the past couple of weeks and have made some fairly decent progress. Called the Homebrewer's Assistance and Monitoring System (HAMS), our system will monitor and control brew temps, automatically pump beer between vessels, and signal the brewer when hops need to be added. The recipe will be input by the brew master either as a URL to a hopville recipe, or manually.
This is our first post, so we will go over our progress up to this point:
After settling on an overall frame design, we set about getting the metal, fabbing the frame parts and welding everything together.
The frame is nearly complete, the lower burner plate needs to have it's support welded in place and the steel grate for holding the propane tank needs to be put into place. The lower burner will fold up and down for storage purposes when finished. Here is what the brew frame looks like so far:
We were able to score some old kegs from a local brewery, which we have been working on converting into keggles. So far we have just cut holes in the top of the kegs to match the diameter of a glass pot lid we had lying around.
Our initial idea was to just have the system monitor temperatures, and control pumping. We would simply pump our strike water into the mash tun when we had reached our strike temp, mash in a cooler and not worry about temperature control, then pump from the mash into the HLT for boiling.
After some thought, we decided that temperature control will be better than simply monitoring. It will allow us to have better consistency across brews, give our computer more control over the brewing process, and reduce the impact of human error. Since we already have the burners, we are going to go ahead and install them anyway, since we might want to use propane to brew with the system off, or have an additional heat source for rapid boiling. In addition to the burners, we will be adding low-density electric heating elements to the keggles, which we will be controlling with a simple PID controller (we will implement the PID on an Arduino).
This week we plan on finishing up the folding burner (we need to add supports), plumb in the propane, and add couplers to our keggles.
After that, the electric heating elements will be installed in the keggles, wired for 220V, and hooked up with solid state relays.
A water proof electrical box will be added to the brew stand, which will house our Arduino, relays and water pump.
We will then be able to route thermometers, electricity, and plumbing and get moving on the tech side of things, very exciting!
The frame is currently at my Dad's shop Wasco Frame Service, where it will remain while in construction.

A naked man allegedly attacked an Orange County woman with a stick and swung her dog around, before police arrested him.
On Tuesday around 2:30 p.m., 75-year-old Sara Hurtado was walking her dog near her home on Rockwood Street in Irvine's Woodbridge neighborhood, when she was suddenly attacked by a naked man wielding a stick, reports CBS LA. The man reportedly knocked Hurtado to the ground and began beating her with the stick. “He sat over her and he started beating her on the face, on the upper chest,” Rocio Fitzsimons, Hurtado's daughter, told CBS LA.
The man then took the family's small dog, Dukay, and began swinging it by the leash, according to Neil Fitzsimons, Hurtado's son-in-law. “Our dog must have upset him by interfering. He took the dog by the leash and starting spinning it around.”
When Irvine police arrived, they found the man—now identified as Craig Andrew Ledbetter, 51, naked and swinging a stick. Ledbetter reportedly acted aggressively toward police before they subdued him using Tasers, reports the L.A. Times.
Hours earlier in the day, police had received other reports of Ledbetter acting strangely, but had cause for arrest at that point.
Ledbetter has been charged with aggravated assault, elder abuse, animal cruelty and resisting a police officer. There is reportedly no known connection between him and Hurtado and the incident is still under investigation.
Hurtado was hospitalized with a dislocated arm, internal bleeding, and swollen eyes.
Anyone with information about the case should call Detective Gavin Hudson at (949) 724-7168.

For years, allegations have swirled about medical missionary Donn Ketcham's inappropriate sexual behavior.
A surgeon serving in Bangladesh with the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism (ABWE) from 1961 to 1989, Ketcham was accused of both affairs with fellow female missionaries and the sexual abuse of 4 women and 18 girls, many times under the guise of medical care.
Those allegations were true, ABWE confirmed today in a 280-page report by Professional Investigators International (Pii), which conducted more than 200 interviews and sifted through 14,000 pages of material during its three-year investigation. (Ketcham and his family refused to speak to Pii investigators.)
“There is no amount of remorse, regret, or shame that can make up for the suffering and pain we caused,” stated Al Cockrell, interim president of ABWE, in announcing the report's release. “We are offering to meet with the victims in person to express our deepest apology, to pay for counseling for them, and to ensure them we have implemented measures to prevent such deplorable behavior again.”

Last week, ABWE's board voted to require every leader to undergo abuse training. The missions group has also changed its reporting system and improved accountability and communication, Cockrell told CT in an in-person interview. [His video statement for ABWE is below.]
“We are strong, beautiful women who were once adorable, innocent little girls,” noted Ketcham's victims on Mother's Day via their “Bangladesh MKs Speak” Facebook group. “[After seeing the report], we were again faced with ugly, hurtful details regarding our stories. This has been an incredibly difficult, painful, emotional week. BUT! Today [Mother's Day] we remember and focus on the fact that though hurt, we are still strong, beautiful women, now mothers and grandmothers, that have dozens of reasons to focus on joy and gratitude.”
On Tuesday, moderators of the MK group's blog sent CT their response to the ABWE report:
We are processing these 280 pages that cover events from the 1960s through the present on both an emotional and practical level, and ask for your patience and prayers at this time. The victims who received the report (not all have received it yet) have had it for eight days, which have been a roller coaster of emotions and tears for many of us, in part because it truly seemed this chapter of our story might never be written. This was a long, long time coming. Ketcham's victims are grown women now—some are mothers, some are even grandmothers—and the wait for ABWE to act has been decades long.
The report's release is the latest chapter in the burgeoning twin movements of “missionary kids" (MKs) becoming more proactive in standing up for victims, and missions agencies taking abuse prevention more seriously.
Revelations of sexual abuse of MKs in the field have primarily come from boarding schools, most notably New Tribes Mission's Fanda Missionary School in Senegal and the Christian and Missionary Alliance's Mamou Alliance Academy in Guinea. (Compassion International's past president Wess Stafford shared his survival story in a 2010 CT cover story.)
Such schooling arrangements are increasingly rare. By contrast, Ketcham's abuse occurred in a mission compound among MKs who lived with their families.
The trouble began even before Ketcham entered the mission field in 1961; his behavior was sexually inappropriate as early as high school, when he admitted to “heavy petting” with an unknown number of girls, according to the Pii report. During medical school, he had an extramarital affair. During his medical internship, he had another. During residency, a third.
Ketcham was sent with his wife to the brand-new Memorial Christian Hospital (MCH), built on the edge of the jungle in Malumghat, Bangladesh. He helped to get the fledgling mission hospital off the ground. Aided by a “charismatic personality,” he “wielded tremendous influence in the organization among the national population, his missionary peers, and the leadership of ABWE,” according to the Pii report.

The first red flag that ABWE staff saw was Ketcham's “inappropriate sexual humor and overflirtatiousness,” which led to the first of several extramarital affairs with single ABWE missionaries who were stationed with him in Bangladesh.
Ketcham's colleagues reported his flirting and affair to their superiors in 1973, and the Bangladesh Field Council sent ABWE's home office a letter listing 19 points of concern about his behavior. They said they didn't want him to return unless he completed counseling.
So ABWE's then-president Wendell Kempton had two telephone conversations and one in-person talk with Ketcham about his behavior, then sent him back to the field. The single missionary woman with whom he had the affair was not allowed to return.
After returning to the field, Ketcham seemed to be on his “best behavior,” fellow missionaries reported.
But “the medical records and testimony from the victims indicate that this was the peak period of Donn Ketcham's sexual abuse of young girls under the guise of medical care,” according to the Pii report.
Ketcham examined minors without a nurse or parent present, conducted unnecessary pelvic exams of young girls, and measured the breast development of girls as young as nine.
One missionary mom recalled that Ketcham's breast exams of her teen daughters seemed “to go on and on,” while several victims experienced losing large chunks of time when they were with Ketcham. They wonder if they were drugged. (The report suggests Ketamine, a disassociative anesthetic often used at MCH.)
Nine years later, in 1984, Ketcham had another affair—this time with a missionary nurse. She was sent home; he was transferred for a year to another ABWE location in Bangladesh. Although he was banned from practicing medicine at MCH, he often returned to fill in. (The hospital handled about 800 surgeries a year at that time.)
Ketcham returned to the United States for furlough, attended 17 of the required 30 counseling sessions ABWE assigned him to, and was cleared again to return to the field. Kempton and other leaders called the affair “an incident of indiscretion.”
Image: ABWE
Back in Bangladesh, Ketcham began tutoring the 13-year-old daughter of a fellow missionary couple. But in addition to math, he taught her how to French kiss and how to stimulate her body and his. (There were no allegations of intercourse. But counselor Russell Lloyd, who worked with both Ketcham and the girl, wrote it was “highly probable” but the girl “is afraid to say so,” according to the Pii report.)
Over roughly six months, Ketcham met the girl privately at least 10 times in his office, in hospital exam rooms, and in his home. In July 1989, she reported the abuse to her pastor.
This prompted ABWE to dismiss Ketcham. But first, it “strongly encouraged” the girl to sign a confession, without her parents' knowledge, that she “participated in a physical relationship with Dr. Don [sic] that transgressed God's Word and was not pleasing to him.”
The then-14-year-old ostensibly wrote:
I have not wanted to hurt anyone in doing this or in confessing it, but I know what I did was very wrong, and I am very sorry for it. I have asked God's forgiveness, and I know he has forgiven me. I pray he will help me and others through this time, and that I will become the person God wants me to be.
After ignoring the warnings signs about Ketcham (which, according to ABWE's policies, could have resulted in his termination in 1974), ABWE compounded its error by questioning the girl extensively over two days to confirm her story and encouraging her to “confess,” according to the Pii report.
Other errors, according to Pii investigators, included ABWE's choice to mask the reason for Ketcham's dismissal under the general term immorality; when he returned to his home church, he was allowed to teach Sunday school. ABWE also didn't report Ketcham to legal authorities in Bangladesh or in the United States; he continued to practice medicine in Grand Rapids, Michigan, until 2012.
ABWE made another mistake by neglecting to look for any other victims, Pii investigators concluded. In 2002, seven adult women came forward, alleging abuse. (Eventually, Pii was able to corroborate the abuse of 5 adult and 18 child victims, not including Ketcham's extramarital affairs.) ABWE's then-president Michael Loftis promised to look into it, and started a nine-year investigation that didn't ask victims for their testimony and was never completed.
Pii investigators also uncovered “written and spoken evidence” that Ketcham and his oldest son, the now-deceased Thomas Ketcham, abused Bengali adults and children.
Frustrated, the victims started a blog in March 2011. Two months later, ABWE announced it had hired GRACE (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment). The next month, the ABWE board terminated Loftis. (Kempton later lost the honor of having a Bible college facility named after him.)
In February 2012, Ketcham surrendered his license to practice medicine.
In February 2013, after two years of investigation, ABWE fired GRACE, alleging “a myriad of investigative flaws.” Pii was hired as a replacement, a move that alarmed victims.
“Approximately 7 percent of the alleged victims and former ABWE missionaries declined to interview with Pii,” the report stated. “In some cases, those that would not speak to Pii conveyed a lack of trust due to ABWE's early termination of the GRACE investigation and stated beliefs that Pii was not fully independent from ABWE.”
In turn, GRACE charged ABWE with “repeated objections to providing requested documents” and “failing to provide GRACE with access to crucial witnesses.”
Pii stated that it was “plagued by the same behaviors.”
ABWE's legal coordinator Nancy Anderson lied about and hid the existence of hundreds of documents pertaining to Ketcham at the direction of ABWE attorney Robert Showers, according to the Pii report. After Showers was removed in 2014, Pii investigators were able to access more than 7,000 additional pages of evidence.
Removing Showers wasn't the only thing ABWE did right, according to the Pii report.
The missions agency has paid for counseling for some of the victims, issued a formal public apology, removed anyone who obstructed the investigation, and changed its policies.
“The best thing we've done from a child protection standpoint is we've sought the advice and protection of child protection agencies,” Cockrell told CT. Those agencies “provide a mechanism whereby if such an abuse should take place again—and no one can guarantee that it won't—we have now the systems in place that we can identify [abusers] quickly and rapidly and deal with them.”
ABWE has worked to create a transparent culture and a policy that “will not accept even a hint of a mistake when it comes to child abuse.”
A quarter-century ago, the process was “far too informal,” said Cockrell. “We have worked very hard at changing the culture from that perspective. There is a different culture on the field today. There is a different culture in the home office today, for that matter.”
Instead of dealing with whispers of abuse “in house”—in the family-like environment on the field—allegations are to be immediately reported to the home office, he said.
Policies aren't much good without the right personnel to enforce them, which ABWE believes are now in place. “There was inadequate training taking place in those days for those who were responsible, and the investigation revealed there were people who knew about the abuse,” Cockrell told CT. “They did not follow up on the abuse, and that is totally unacceptable today.”
The Pii report exposed “how much harm and damage was done to the victims,” said Cockrell.
“Our greatest is concern is that we do everything we can to assist and help victims at this stage,” he said. “It is our hope that God will allow us to fix some things.”

Bernie Sanders, a US presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, launched a petition calling on the federal government to abandon its alleged plans of launching raids and deportations of undocumented Latin American migrants.
MOSCOW (Sputnik) — The administration of US President Barack Obama is reportedly planning a month-long series of raids this month until June to deport Central American women and children from the United States.
"Sending women and children back into harm's way after they already fled horrendous violence in Central America is painful and inhumane, and must be stopped," Sanders said in his petition sent to his supporters on Saturday, as quoted by his website.

Earlier this week, Sanders expressed his opposition to the alleged plans, citing "the horrific violence" in Central America and other countries.
A similar series of raids in January resulted in the detention of 121 people, most of them women and children who claimed to have fled gang violence and forced recruitment in several Central American nations.
OTTAWA — Canadian economic growth unexpectedly paused in October as a decline in oil and gas extraction offset gains in the wholesale trade and retail sectors, data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday.
The unchanged reading for gross domestic product was short of economists' forecasts for a gain of 0.2 per cent following September's unrevised 0.2 per cent increase.
Growth in the second half of 2017 is expected to have cooled from the blistering pace set in the first half of the year, though analysts expect improvement in the labour market and inflation will see the Bank of Canada continue to tighten interest rates next year.
Activity in goods-producing sectors of the economy declined by 0.4 per cent in October, led by a 1.1 per cent pullback in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry.
It was the fourth decline in the sector in five months as non-conventional oil extraction fell, partly due to a loss of capacity during maintenance. Mining also declined by 0.8 per cent.
But the weakness was tempered by a 1.4 per cent increase in wholesale trade, which was helped by sales of machinery and equipment.
The retail sector grew by 1.1 per cent after three consecutive months of declines as consumers bought more new and used cars. Overall, the service sector grew by 0.2 per cent.

Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and James Pattinson were all wearing the same boots when they suffered foot injuries this season © AFP
Boots worn by the young fast bowlers Pat Cummins, James Pattinson and Josh Hazlewood are being investigated by Cricket Australia as a potential source of the foot injuries that have cruelled their summer.
Pat Howard, the Australia team performance manager, has requested the investigation after noting that Cummins, Pattinson and Hazlewood were all wearing the same type of Asics cricket boots while sustaining foot injuries.
"I've asked exactly the same question," Howard told ESPNcricinfo. "It's a fair question, we're not suggesting it is the reason, but it is something that has to be reviewed as part of the overall.
"Workloads, body management, history, age, footwear, all those things have got to be reviewed as part of the bigger picture.
"There's lots of people wearing Asics that haven't had that problem. It is definitely being reviewed, but the reality is they're all young men and it is also about how much bowling have they done in the lead-up to this period [to getting injured]."
Cummins complained of heel pain during his Test debut against South Africa in Johannesburg, and has not played a competitive match since after the early signs of stress fractures were spotted.
Pattinson scooped 25 wickets in four Tests before complaining of foot pain during the second innings of the SCG Test, and was ruled out of the remainder of the series against India when scans also revealed stress hot spots in the metatarsal bone.
Hazlewood, who made his ODI debut for Australia in 2010, returned to action for New South Wales this summer after a lengthy recovery from back stress fractures, but has been put out of action for the remainder of the domestic summer due to a fracture in his left foot.
When he took the job as team performance manager from a background of rugby and pharmacy, Howard promised to ask awkward questions, and the one of fast bowlers' footwear is not the most convenient. Asics, manufacturers of the boots worn by the fast bowling trio, took up a lucrative equipment and sponsorship deal with CA at the start of the summer.
Asics boots have long been the favoured footwear of fast bowlers in Australia, and are also popular in England.
Howard said that while the injuries had been unfortunate for those concerned, they had also allowed the selectors to expand the pool of fast bowlers they are confident of choosing for international duty, whether they be in the marquee series against India or lower profile engagements against New Zealand or the West Indies.
"We have changed the mandate for what we look for out of different series," Howard said. "What we have done well and the selectors and the coaches and the medical staff have worked really hard on, is having Mitchell Starc and Ryan Harris there around the Test team.
"They were coming into the squad in Sydney, bowling in the nets in Melbourne, we wanted these guys in and around because we knew the workloads had been very high for the likes of James Pattinson and we had to make sure players were ready to go.
"Part of it is mitigating injury and part of it is making sure the next guys are raring and ready to go. We know players will be injured and one of the positive things we've got out of this summer is we've got a lot of bowlers we believe in, and we actually believe there's a couple more we can believe in. That's been a positive out of the summer."

Sometimes the way people express their sexual preferences can become discriminatory — even racist.
On Tuesday, The Daily Show's Jessica Williams and Ronny Chieng looked at the issue, focusing on some of the stereotypes that Asian men and black women in general face in the fields of dating and sex.
The term for this: sexual racism. Zach Stafford, who writes for the Guardian, explained, "When someone says something like, 'I don't date black people,' talking about all black people, that would be referred to as sexual racism."
Christian Rudder, co-founder of OKCupid, looked at data on online dating — who people messaged, who they matched with, who they responded to, and so on — and found a few patterns. "There is kind of a systemic racial bias pretty much in every dating site I've ever looked at," he said. "We found that 82 percent of non-black men have some bias against black women. … And Asian men get the fewest messages and the worst ratings of any group of guys."
But it's not just the data. Williams and Chieng reached out to black women and Asian men to hear their testimonials on online dating. They said they constantly dealt with stereotypes. One black woman said, "One of the first Tinder messages I ever got was, 'Did you know that 90 percent of black women have herpes?'" An Asian man said, "So I went to this one white girl's profile. And on her profile it said, 'No Chinese guys, because Chinese guys have small dicks.'"
This is judging someone through a truly superficial perspective — one that solely looks at a person's skin color. This wouldn't be acceptable in any other aspect of society, but it's widespread in the dating world.
So what's behind this sexual racism? Stafford said, "The media tells us what we think is beautiful. When you live in a world that only shows white people being happy and in love and successful, even as people of color you're going to want that, and that's kind of what fuels your dating desires and sexual racism."
These kinds of biases, then, are one reason that diversity in TV shows and movies is so important: If decades of seeing predominantly white people succeed in media has warped people's views, then perhaps giving people a more diverse exposure could turn those views around.

Code reuse in clojure
niquola Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 22, 2015
Couple of years ago i've irreversibly switched from ruby to clojure and one of the key motivations was the mean size clojure libraries — it was extremely small while solving the same problems. We've been crafted 0.5M SLOC ruby project for 6–7 years, that's time and amount of code comparable with labor spent on framework/libraries and that's when you are not writing code on top, but fill and know your system and your stack as a organic whole. During this time you are in-lining and extracting libraries from/into code-base. And that's was quite painful to discover “incidental implementation complexity” most of them (including our own).
For me the very attractive side of ruby community is elegance and humanity of libraries design and that's why such a small community had a huge influence on the whole industry. But things not so good inside, in implementation code, which some times really awkward. And this is not the only ruby problem, from my point of view, this is problem of most imperative & OOP languages. This paradigm gives you to much freedom and does not give you enough clean guidelines. You are constantly lost following dispatching chain through strange entities looking for the meat.
It was amazing to discover internals of clojure libraries. Typical clojure library is no more than ~10 files with 100–500 SLOC each, properly focused on solving one concrete problem. And it's important, that you can read, understand, fix or in-line such libraries into your project within hours or days. It was interesting experience to see the last commit for some libraries several months ago and understand that library is not dead — it's just done. And this situation is very similar to “unix utilites”: a lot of them were touched many years ago, but work and nothing to add.
So why?
Let's explore the unix way: here we have uniform interface to glue utilities together — it's just exec interface and piping stdout into next stdin. This allows you to create very problem-focused utils and then compose them into something you need.
What is the clojure way?
Clojure also has “least common denominator” and this is clojure's “Rich” data-structures. It's common for clojure library to expose just one top level functions as API (honeysql, ring, garden, prismatic schema), awaiting/producing generic data-structure of specific shape.
That's why it is so easy to glue clojure libraries together by just providing output of one library function result as input for another. And following authors of “Why functional programming matters”:
The ways in which one can divide up the original problem depend directly on the ways in which one can glue solutions together
that's why clojure libraries could be kept small and precisely focused on problem, bringing to you pragmatic “simplicity”.
The small joke for ending: OOP was invented, because there was no good implementation of hash-map at that time.

The district attorney for Marin County, Calif. is offering free ice cream in exchange for "violent video games" through the month of October, in an exchange program that mimicks successful firearms buybacks in his and other jurisdictions.
A story announcing the buyback doesn't describe how a video game for exchange will be judged to be violent; it appears the exchange is one ice cream per participant, not per game. The drives coincide with national Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and also will accept exchanges of toy guns.
"As we know domestic violence incidents almost always have children present and these children develop over time imprinted images of the family violence," Ed Berberian, the Marin County D.A., told the Marin Independent Journal. "These children then carry those experiences into their adult lives and often repeat the pattern of violence in their own family units."
The exchanges will take place each Saturday in October, beginning Oct. 4 in Novato, Calif. and later at three other locations. The ice cream will be donated by a local Ben & Jerry's franchise.
Berberian's gun buyback program last year resulted in 857 weapons exchanged for more than $100,000. The Marin Independent Journal noted that last year, a boy carrying an air rifle made to resemble an AK-47 assault rifle, was shot to death by a deputy in neighboring Sonoma County.

An informational battle of competing messages directed at international audiences parallels the military fighting between Israel and Hamas. Accompanying a barrage of wrenching images are Palestinian fatality statistics alleging disproportionate numbers of non-combatants. These figures are crucial because they form the basis of accusations that Israel uses excessive and indiscriminate force.
Hamas, the terrorist group controlling Gaza, endeavors to turn Israel's military superiority to its own advantage by portraying the Israeli response to intense rocket and mortar fire as disproportionate and indiscriminate. In doing so, it hopes to turn public opinion against the Jewish state, as well as bolster its own standing at the expense of the Fatah-led Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank.
Fatality figures provided by Hamas and other groups should be viewed with suspicion. Not only do Israeli figures cast doubt on claims that the vast majority of fatalities are non-combatants, but a careful review of Palestinian sources also raises doubts.
Analyses of the casualties listed in the daily reports published by the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, a Gaza-based organization operating under Hamas rule, indicate that young males ages 17 to 30 make up a large portion of the fatalities, and a particularly noticeable spike occurs between males ages 21 to 27, a pattern consistent with the age distribution typically found among combatants and military conscripts. Palestinian sources attempt to conceal this discrepancy with their public message by labeling most of these young men as civilians. Only a minority is identified as members of armed groups. As a result, the PCHR calculates civilian fatalities at 82% as of July 26. PCHR provides the most detailed casualty reports of the various Palestinian agencies from Gaza that provide figures to the media and to international organizations like the UN. Its figures closely match those of the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and other groups.
We have seen this before. A similar dispute over casualty figures occurred during Israel's “Operation Cast Lead” in the Gaza Strip in January 2009. The Israelis contended that the majority of the fatalities were combatants; the Palestinians claimed they were civilians. The media and international organizations tended to side with the Palestinians. The UN's own investigatory commission headed by Richard Goldstone, which produced the Goldstone Report, cited PCHR's figures along with other Palestinian groups providing similar figures. Over a year later, after the news media had moved on, Hamas Interior Minister Fathi Hammad enumerated Hamas fatalities at 600 to 700, a figure close to the Israeli estimate of 709 and about three times higher than the figure of 236 combatants provided by PCHR in 2009 and cited in the Goldstone Report. Initially, playing to the international audience, it was important for Hamas to reinforce the image of Israel's military action as indiscriminate and disproportionate by emphasizing the high number of civilians and low number of Hamas combatants among the fatalities. However, later on, Hamas had to deal with the flip side of the issue: that Hamas's own constituency, the Gazan population, felt they had been abandoned by the Hamas government, which had made no effort to shelter them.
Scrutiny of Palestinian figures in the current conflict reveals a spike in fatalities among males ages 21 to 27 and an over-representation from ages 17 to 30. Data gleaned from the daily reports of the PCHR show that from July 8, the start of Israel's “Operation Protective Edge,” through July 26, 404 out of 915 fatalities tallied from daily reports in which the ages were identified occurred among males ages 17 to 30, comprising 44% of all fatalities among a group representing about 10% of Gazans.
Expanding the age range from 17 to 39 and including those identified as combatants whose ages were not given increases that number to 551 fatalities, or 57% of all fatalities, even though this group represents less than one-sixth of Gazans. By contrast, adult female fatalities were less than 10% of total fatalities for a group that comprises a quarter of the total population.
Children, here defined as those under age 17, represented 194 of fatalities, 20% of the total. Any child fatality is a tragedy, but it is important to note that children make up over half the population of Gaza.
Despite the discrepancies noted, the substantial number of civilian fatalities leaves room for further scrutiny. In seeking an alternate explanation for the excess of young male fatalities, it might be posited that this reflects some behavioral feature of this group separate from combat-related activities. However, the shape of the fatality demographic makes this unlikely. What feature would explain the sharp increase from age 17, peaking at ages 22 to 25 and then declining rapidly after age 30?
A more plausible explanation is that the age demographic of the fatalities reflects the relative involvement of different age bands in hostilities. Of course, some of those in the most represented age-bands aren't combatants. However, balancing that, Palestinian and Israeli sources confirm that a portion of the fatalities over age 40 were senior Hamas or Islamic Jihad operatives targeted by Israel.
Furthermore, this overall breakdown of the number of fatalities doesn't address important issues like the portion of female and children casualties who were family members of targeted combatants who failed to heed Israeli evacuation warnings or were perhaps intimidated into remaining as “human shields.”
The demographic analysis of the fatalities in the Gaza conflict has limitations. It can't identify who is or isn't a combatant. But the spike in fatalities among males starting in their late teens and peaking in their early to mid-twenties, and the divergence of the pattern of fatalities from the demographic pattern of the population, raises considerable doubt about claims that as many as 75% or more of the fatalities are non-combatants. In light of evidence—provided by groups that monitor Arabic language media (like the Middle East Media Research Institute)—that Hamas has instructed Gazans to describe anyone killed as a civilian, journalists have a responsibility to convey this uncertainty to their audiences and not present figures provided by Hamas and Hamas-affiliated sources as unqualified fact.

The 2017 NFL Draft has come and gone and training camps are in full swing. The NFL is back with a head of steam. With the first preseason game for Los Angeles' new resident kicking off on August 13, the Chargers' front office has time to consider who should make the 53-man squad.
Most of the players seem like obvious locks to make the final roster, but, as with every season, we will most likely see some surprise cuts and additions on the final roster.
The Chargers already began cutting veterans when they released King Dunlap, Brandon Flowers and Stevie Johnson. Are there other expensive veterans the front office could deem replaceable by a younger player with more potential? The Chargers also have the longest streak in the league of having an undrafted free-agent rookie make the team, at 20 years. Who will it be this year?
Yes, it is far too early to tell, what with injuries and players coming out of nowhere, but who doesn't love a little speculation?
Among the biggest new feature to be added as part of a software update that will go out to users this morning is support for XML. This adds the option to both import and export projects and events in the XML format, meaning users can take XML formatted projects and work on them in Final Cut Pro X.
That addition addresses one of the potential sticking points for upgraders, who were left unable to open old Final Cut Pro projects in the newer version of the software. XML support brings that indirectly, as users can export Final Cut Pro 7 projects in XML, then import them into Final Cut Pro X via a third-party tool like CatDV from Square Box.
Media stems export in Final Cut Pro X 10.0.1

As reported by CNET and Macworld , Apple has released a major update to its Final Cut Pro X software, making a number of improvements and addressing some of the strong criticism that has been levied against the revamped video production software.One of the major features included in the update is support for XML, an addition that had been promised in an Apple FAQ posted to address the backlash against the software.notes:Other additions in Final Cut Pro X 10.0.1 include support for events and projects through Xsan, support for media stems, custom starting time codes, full-screen view for OS X Lion, and GPU-accelerated export. Apple has also released a new software development kit in order to help camera manufacturers create plug-ins to make their latest cameras compatible with Final Cut Pro X.Apple is also promising another update to bring multi cam editing and broadcast video output support, but that update isn't expected to launch until next year.One other important change for Final Cut Pro X is the addition of a new 30-day free trial for the software, giving users the opportunity to test out the software before committing to a $299.99 purchase. Apple did issue refunds for unhappy early purchasers of Final Cut Pro X, and thus it appears that the company has launched the free trial in order to cut down on those refund requests.: Apple has also released a 4.0.1 update for Compressor Motion has also received an update to version 5.0.1.Finally, Apple has released an updated version of its ProApps QuickTime Codecs to support the new releases.
A 74-year-old CEO was stabbed to death early Friday during a home invasion, the Fayette County Sheriff's Office said. Investigators arrested two suspects, but a third remained on the run late Friday.
The incident was initially reported as a shooting at a home on Lake Horton Landing Drive, Sheriff Barry Babb said. The residence is off Brooks Woolsey Road in an upscale lakefront community in the southern portion of the county.
When Fayette deputies got to the home about 2:30 a.m., they found the owner with a stab wound, Babb said. The homeowner was taken to Piedmont Fayette Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He was identified late Friday as Albert Eugene DeMagnus.

The homeowner's wife told authorities three men demanded cash and jewelry before taking the victim's gray Lexus and leaving the scene. That's when she called 911.
Deputies spotted the Lexus near the scene of the home invasion, Babb said. The stolen car crashed in the area of Jimmie Mayfield Boulevard and Bradley Drive and two men ran, he said. Deputies and Fayetteville police officers found located both men.
Jeffrey Lee Wallace, 22, of Atlanta, and Kavion Wyzeenski Tookes, 21, of Decatur, were both arrested and being held Friday night at the Fayette County jail.
Authorities set up a perimeter and searched cars for the third person, according to Channel 2.
“We believe the third person left the area in another vehicle,” Babb said.
DeMagnus was the CEO of Computer Management Services, Inc., according to the Georgia Secretary of State's Office.

In addition to these journalists' dedication and excellent work, technology played an important role in bringing this investigation together
The exposure of a massive trove of documents pointing to the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that arranged shell companies and other methods of obscuring funds from public view has sent shock waves on a global scale.
The “Panama Papers” report was produced after a year-long intensive effort by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
In the leak that led to the investigation, the documents cite that world leaders including Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Saudi royals are among those who used the services of Mossack Fonseca to hide their money. Politicians were not the only ones caught with their pants down, exposed to questions of corruption and other questionable practices. The German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung that helped to lead the investigation, which included over 100 other media organizations, reported that soccer stars like Lionel Messi and FIFA ethics expert Juan Pedro Damiani were also involved in the shell companies suspected of having been used in the best of cases for money laundering, tax evasion, and bribery.
In addition to these journalists' dedication and excellent work, technology played an important role in bringing this investigation together. Of particular interest is the use of encrypted communications, both between the unnamed leaker of the nearly 2.6 terabytes of information and the journalists running the story, as well as the journalists themselves.
According to their report, it appears that an employee or someone with inside access to Mossack Fonseca's operations reached out to Süddeutsche Zeitung through an encrypted chat, offering them information.
In a video on their site, journalists at Süddeutsche Zeitung mention that they used encrypted communications like chats, forums, and emails between themselves and their source. With many of the subjects of the investigation holding high offices in countries with advanced cyber capabilities, like Putin in Russia and the cadre of Chinese officials that were named in the report, they had good reason to use secure means to keep their investigation secret.
On the ICIJ's website, they posted a page where they encourage those with information regarding “potential wrongdoing by corporate, government or public service entities” from all over the world to contact them. Along with their email, they added a link to access their PGP key for sending (more) secure emails.
The vast majority of journalists have relied on PGP (Pretty good privacy) for encrypting their communications, using programs like Mailvelope, ProtonMail, Tutanota, and Lavaboom. In this system a user generates two sets of keys, public and private. The public one is posted in places like the MIT PGP Public Key Server. This allowed anyone (for better or worse) to look up how to reach their intended contact person securely.
The second private key is never to be shared with anyone ever. In this scenario, only the person who possesses the private key could unlock and read messages sent through encrypted channels, providing a decent level of privacy and helping to defend against “Man in the Middle” attacks where messages can be intercepted and read.
Though not specified, it is likely that the source and journalists used a variety of chat apps to message each other throughout the ordeal. While U.S. government officials have complained about apps like WhatsApp and other well known services having some kind of encryption that hampers their intelligence collection efforts, comparatively they are not considered to be on the high end for security. Telegram has gained popularity over the past year, with apps like Signal receiving higher praise for security of communication. Then there are chat programs like Cryptocat that can be used for even more anonymity.
Despite the high level of security that comes along with many of the communications solutions out there, the Süddeutsche Zeitung journalists say that they felt more comfortable speaking in person.
They tell potential sources that sometimes the best way to send them leaked information is “the old fashioned way,” providing their mailing address for copies of documents and other evidence of wrongdoing.
For all the technological solutions out there for sending information, in the case of WikiLeaks whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Chelsea (born Bradley) Manning, the documents were directly downloaded onto external hard drives or CDs before being brought to journalists, likely in person.
They also advise that whistleblowers try to avoid creating a trail that could be traced back to them, suggesting that internet cafes are safer for sending files rather than using a device or IP that is connected to them.
While this story continues to unfold, with many more curveballs and juicy bits as revelations come to the surface about the dirty dealings of the rich and powerful, the journalists involved in getting to the bottom of this widespread corruption will continue to rely on the new digital tools of their trade to connect with sources, bringing some much-needed sunlight to the darkest depths of depravity.
Christians should clean up their own act before condemning gay marriage, said actor Kirk Cameron, who was visiting Alabama to lead marriage seminars.
"When people get too focused on redefining marriage, you're distracted from the bigger problem - fornicators and adulterers," Cameron said.
"If the people sitting in the pews are fornicators and adulterers, the church will destroy marriages much more quickly than those outside the church. When God's people mock marriage, God doesn't take that lightly."
Cameron declined to criticize gay marriage and same-sex unions, saying that's not a priority.
"I think the greatest threat to marriage is not other people's definition of marriage," Cameron said in an interview with AL.com. "The church isn't taking God's definition of marriage seriously. It's not other people sabotaging marriage that's the problem."
Cameron led the "Love Worth Fighting For" marriage seminar at First Baptist Church in Fairhope on May 3 and at First Baptist Church in Gardendale on May 16. The seminar also features singer Warren Barfield, who wrote the music for the movie "Fireproof," which starred Cameron as a firefighter. Cameron was a Golden Globe nominee for best actor for his role as Mike Seaver on the TV sitcom "Growing Pains" from 1985-92. Cameron and his wife, Chelsea, met as on-screen sweethearts during "Growing Pains."
They are the founders of Camp Firefly, where terminally and seriously ill children and their families are provided an all-expense paid retreat (www.CampFirefly.com). Together, Kirk and Chelsea live in California with their six children.
"Marriage is still important to people," Cameron said. "They know that marriage is worth fighting for. They want it to be strong."
The seminar grew out of the "Fireproof" movie. "We took the 'Fireproof' movie, the top grossing independent movie of 2008, and turned it into a three and a half hour live experience," Cameron said. "It's a home run date night for you and your spouse. Couples come and watch clips from Fireproof, sing together, pray together, laugh together, learn together."
A lack of faithfulness and commitment to marriage has been epidemic in Christian churches, he said.
"Marriage is meant to be for life," Cameron said. "When we do things God's way, there's a blessing. The path of obedience is the path of blessing. Love is worth fighting for. You need to learn how to fight together for your marriage. Sometimes the battle is so bloody that you walk out. You have to learn how to fight the right way. We'll teach you how to fix your wife and your husband, make sure your marriage gets better not bitter. Where joy is found, that's where hope and healing is found. You get in partnership with God. The enemy is not your spouse. The enemy is in your own heart - it's selfishness."
Couples focused on self-interest play the blame game, he said.
"For people who say the problem is not me, it's my spouse, you've just proven the point," Cameron said. "God reopens the path to light and hope and healing. God is faithful to honor those who will put him first."
The seminar is not just for married couples, Cameron said. "It's for couples who are married, separated, engaged, and even those who have never been married. It's really about relationships."
Christians who focus on the behavior of non-Christians need to refocus, Cameron said.
"The church determines the moral temperature of the culture," he said. "On our watch we've let morality decay, the commitment to love and marriage fall apart. We've given in to an anti-biblical Christian worldview. We're simply failing to do our job as the church. Other people are moving into the leadership positions and steering the car right off the cliff. They're not the problem. It's those in the church who have taken their hands off the wheel and given up our place in the driver's seat."
The church has to reform itself in order to reform society, Cameron said.
"We need to be faithful in our own house," he said. "Jesus didn't go shouting at the Romans. He went into the temple. We have the same problem today that people had back then. We've had pastors drop like flies, guys I know. When that happens, it drags the name of Christ through the mud. When hypocrisy grows within the church, it's like pouring fertilizer on the weeds in your garden."
Christians need to get busy influencing the culture and society for God, Cameron said.
"I think there's great hope," he said. "There are those who want to get it right, to turn from our wicked ways, to get marriage right, to get family right. Instead of complaining about a culture, we need to say, 'Show me how to create a culture.'"

Legal team for WikiLeaks founder says Washington may be planning to invoke Espionage Act to indict their client
Lawyers acting for Julian Assange, the editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks, said today they are preparing for a possible indictment by the US authorities.
Jennifer Robinson said her team had heard from "several different US lawyers rumours that an indictment was on its way or had happened already, but we don't know".
According to some reports, Washington is seeking to prosecute Assange under the 1917 act, which was used unsuccessfully to try to gag the New York Times when it published the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s. However, despite escalating rhetoric over the last fortnight, no charges have yet been lodged, and government sources say they are unaware any such move is being prepared.
Robinson said Assange's team did not believe the US had grounds to prosecute him but understood that Washington was "looking closely at other charges, such as computer charges, so we have one eye on it".
Assange is in Wandsworth prison in south London after being refused bail on Tuesday. Sweden is seeking his extradition over allegations of sexual assault.
Speaking to ABC News, Robinson said she did not believe the Espionage Act applied to Assange, adding: "In any event he's entitled to first amendment protection as publisher of WikiLeaks and any prosecution under the Espionage Act would in my view be unconstitutional and puts at risk all media organisations in the US."
Robinson said Assange was being held in solitary confinement in London with restricted access to a phone and his lawyers.
"This means he is under significant surveillance but also means he has more restrictive conditions than other prisoners. Considering the circumstances he was incredibly positive and upbeat."
Earlier this week, the US attorney general, Eric Holder, said the United States had been put at risk by the flood of confidential diplomatic documents released by WikiLeaks and he authorised a criminal investigation.
Holder said: "The lives of people who work for the American people has been put at risk; the American people themselves have been put at risk by these actions that are, I believe, arrogant, misguided and ultimately not helpful in any way. We are doing everything that we can.
"We have a very serious, active, ongoing investigation that is criminal in nature. I authorised just last week a number of things to be done so that we can hopefully get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable, as they should be."
In a letter to the Guardian today, prominent supporters including John Pilger, Terry Jones, Miriam Margolyes and AL Kennedy called for Assange's release. "We protest at the attacks on WikiLeaks and, in particular, on Julian Assange ," they wrote, adding that the leaks have "assisted democracy in revealing the real views of our governments over a range of issues".
President Jacob Zuma's eldest son‚ Edward‚ who has gained notoriety for springing to his father's defence, has lashed out at Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, accusing him of being corrupt.
In a statement released on Friday morning in his personal capacity, Edward accused the minister of having “shares everywhere” and alleged that Gordhan was trying to use his connections to make a profit by trying to sell the state-owned airline, South African Airways, to a relative.
“I want to air my view on how brutal and greedy some of our leaders have become, as they clearly don't have the interests of the people [at heart]. These leaders are in government‚ private sector‚ religious leaders‚ civil societies and many other structures of the country.
“These greedy people don't give a damn about the livelihoods of the people of this country whatsoever; they are thieves who are sucking the wealth of this country using their relationships with these leaders, who in return have business interests in almost everything that is profit making,” reads the statement.
Without proving any supporting evidence to substantiate his allegations against Gordhan, Zuma also criticised global credit-rating agencies, accusing them of holding the country's economy at ransom.
“For example‚ Pravin Gordhan‚ our much-loved finance minister‚ has shares everywhere, and there are those that don't see anything wrong with that but rather turn a blind eye because the country is being threatened by the unprogressive and questionable rating agencies.”
According to Zuma, Gordhan “and company” are continuing to sell and privatise state-owned enterprises to their friends and masters.
“And they again hide behind profitability‚ yet they deliberately run down these institutions so as to sell to their friends or children, as has been seen at the SAA debacle.
“They tried to sell SAA to a company where Gordhan's relative or daughter has interests. What a coincidence. And that plan is still on‚ led by Pravin himself.”
ALSO READ: ANC veterans ‘unhappy' with handling of consultative conference
Edward's scathing attack against Gordhan comes amid speculation in ANC circles that the minister could be removed from his post by Zuma after the state of the nation address – which analysts have warned could see the country plagued by an economic crisis.
Gordhan's deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, who has previously alleged that the controversial Gupta family had offered him R600 million to “capture” National Treasury, is accused by Zuma's son of using the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) along Gordhan as their own playground.
“They are also in charge of the PIC under the chairmanship of the holy Mcebisi Jonas‚ Gordhan's partner in business and colleague in government.
“This institution … is their base and playground for total control and capture of the country‚ as the likes of Shoprite Checkers‚ Bidvest‚ white fund managers and many more Jewish-based entities are running the show without interference from government and with the help of the government officials who have shares in the companies that get money from the PIC.
Edward further stated: “If they dispute my assertion‚ let's go public. I will expose all this.”
‘De Klerk must shut up and enjoy stolen monies'
The last apartheid president of South Africa FW de Klerk was not left unscathed by Edward.
“Civil servants' funds are misused at the blessings of these people, and yet they don't want to increase people's salaries‚ but companies that benefit from workers' funds pay their executives bonuses of millions of dollars. Time will tell, as I have always been saying again, that we are sitting on a time bomb. There comes a time where we will be fed up with these people.
“The sad thing is they will not be around the country to witness that anger, but will be in their Caribbean villas‚ like FW de Klerk, who has all of a sudden become a good governance guru in spite of stealing money to buy an island under his Greek wife. He must shut up and enjoy the cash he stole from government.”
“As all his administration was about corruption and looting of state funds, as it had become clear that power was shifting and his cabinet facilitated transactions‚ like the Absa scandal that we see today. So De Klerk is the last to be telling us where South Africa is or should be going‚” he said.
The Bruins will have to walk a fine line if they hope to defeat the Montreal Canadiens in the coming days.
That means play hard, play with emotion, play Bruins hockey. But don't be dumb and don't be suckered into unnecessary penalties.
The generations of Bruins team that played the 33 previous playoff series against the Canadiens almost always had a better chance to win when the games weren't just about pure skill and speed — but also included elements of emotion and passion and even anger.
But the Canadiens have long been adept at knowing how to push the right B's buttons to get players to lose their cool and seek retaliation, to lose focus on what really matters: winning.
Bruins winger Brad Marchand conceded his team has not always been as under control as it needs to be against this opponent. Take, for example, Montreal's 2-1 shootout win March 24 at the Garden, a game in which Canadiens defenseman Alexei Emelin infuriated winger Milan Lucic with a low-bridge hip check, and B's defenseman Johnny Boychuk lost it against the despicably villainous P.K. Subban.
“It's an emotional game whenever we play them,” Marchand said that night. “They know that, and they poke at us a bit to try and get us to take penalties. It worked a little bit. We have to make sure we have a little more discipline than that. It's just one of those teams that you want to hit.”
So you can bet plenty of time in advance of the belated Eastern Conference second-round series opener between these two ancient rivals will be spent talking about that fine line the B's should approach, but not cross.
“There's always a limit that you can push,” Boychuk said. “You've got to keep your emotions in check. You can be pumped up, but you have to suck it up for the team when something happens. Play hard, play with emotion, but don't be dumb, don't be suckered into unnecessary penalties. You have to make sure you're playing as a team and not as an individual trying to get back at guys.”
Do the Habs deliberately try to goad the Bruins into penalties?
“Probably, yeah, I mean they're good at it,” Boychuk said yesterday. “We seem to go for it. But it's playoffs now. You've got to keep your anger and your personal vendettas at the door and you take it for the team.”
Another carryover from that March game, for Lucic, is the knowledge that Emelin can be a dangerous foe. Not merely a cheap-shot hitter like, for instance, Pittsburgh Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik, but dangerous — a guy who may be trying deliberately to hurt people.
“Whether (the hit was) fair, legal or whatever you want to call it, if he wasn't scared he'd stand up and hit me and not go after my knees,” Lucic said following the March 24 meeting. “It just shows how big of a chicken he is that he has to go down like that to take me down. It shows what kind of player he is. And on my end, you've got to keep your guard up at all times.”
That's always the fear, beyond the Canadiens' chippy play, their diving and whining: the threat of the extreme emotions leading to some really dangerous on-ice event, perpetrated by either side.
Recall the 2002 playoff series when Bruins blueliner Kyle McLaren lined up Canadiens winger Richard Zednik for a vicious, ugly, open-ice elbow to the head, inflicting a concussion, broken nose and fractured cheekbone.
Obviously, nobody wants to see that sort of ultra-violence, no matter how much they may despise the other side. Short of that, though, you can bet there'll be plenty of cheap stuff going on in this series as the Habs try to get the Bruins off their game and engineer what would be a major upset.
Center David Krejci said Montreal has players who make calculated efforts to goad the B's into penalties.
“One hundred percent (they do),” Krejci said yesterday. “They have some guys, we have some guys, who like to do that. That's their game. Some guys are best when they're hitting; some guys are best when, you know, they're chatting with guys. That's just part of the game, part of the player. We're expecting that. I think we just have to focus on our game and we'll be OK.
“Just play smart. It's always going to be a little bit harder than other series, just because it's Montreal. The emotions are high. It's pretty easy to get out of your element (emotionally). But you've got to stick with it. Be smart. Have in the back of your head that you're playing for the team, not for yourself. When something happens, you've got to suck it up.”
All the “be smart” talk sounded reasonable yesterday, before the puck actually drops. Once the juices start flowing and the cheap shots and trash talk start flying, staying calm is not easy for these guys.
“I think it's just the rivalry,” winger Shawn Thornton said. “Everything is heightened because of the rivalry. The emotions are at another level. The intensity is at another level.”
Thornton and other veterans understand very well that emotion has to be part of the game plan to beat Montreal. The young guys who maybe haven't experienced it yet, they'll learn.
“Our guys who have been here long enough already know all about the passion in this rivalry,” Thornton said. “And the guys who just got here this year, they're definitely going to get a good taste of it in a hurry.”
We've all seen signs banning cell phones, food, and drinks. But these rules cover issues that might not be common to all libraries.
1. Keep the door closed due to bats
Rock Creek Flickr
In Charlemont, Massachusetts, the historic Goodnow Hall also houses the public library. If you are having a meeting, make sure you check with the front desk—there's a rule about making sure you keep the door closed in the meeting room. While that might seem hard-nosed, it's for a good cause: keeping bats from the building's tower out of the library.
2. No balloons
Don't even think about it! Scouting New York spotted this one at the Yonkers Public Library.
3. Deface materials, face hard time
What is it with Massachusetts, anyway? According to Chapter 266 Section 100 of the general laws, it's illegal to deface any library materials. Ok, we get that: no doodling. But let's be serious for a moment. The punishment involves replacing the materials, up to two years in prison, and up to a $1000 fine. Really? For doodles?
4. No unzipped clothes
At the Central Arkansas Library System, librarians decided to tackle a problem head-on. There is a rule about unzipped, unfastened, and unbuttoned clothing, which is designed to curb the tide of indecency. The first question you might want to ask: Just how “unbuttoned” do they mean, and have they seen what teenagers wear?
5. No chewing on headphone cords
A.R. Moore Flickr
At an undisclosed library in Georgia, there's a rule about chewing on headphone cords. Sure, there are health concerns, depending on which library patron we're talking about, but a more pressing problem has to do with damage. If too many people break the rule, the library will stop offering headphones altogether.
6. Do not reach across my desk!
At a university library in Manhattan, Kansas, there's a rule about reaching across the cubicle of one of the staff members. The reason? Apparently, this particular staff person has had a problem with plants tipping and falling. See the full complaint at Passive Aggressive Notes.
7. No bathing
Here's one to keep in mind if you visit Seattle anytime soon. At the city's public library, it's illegal to take a bath in the restroom. For those curious about the legalities governing shampooing your hair, changing your clothes, or doing laundry: those are not kosher, either.
8. No re-shelving, even by library majors
LibraryKitty Flickr
Like many libraries, the University of Wisconsin in Madison has a rule about not re-shelving books. But this sign, designed by one of the library's employees and posted on Flickr, was too good to leave out. (Another sign mentions that finding a book reshelved in the wrong place is as difficult as finding Jimmy Hoffa.)
9. No use of library as a commercial business
At the Warren-Trumbull County Public Library in Ohio, you can't use the library as a place of ongoing commercial business. That means: for accountants or real estate agents, you're going to have to get a real office. Or move operations over to the local Starbucks.
Or Just Makes One Very Broad Rule
Call this one the rule to end all rules: at the South Pasadena Public Library, there's a sign that reads "No illegal behavior of any type." That pretty much covers it—unless you're in Massachusetts where the rules are a bit more specific.
* * *
We know there are a lot of librarians, library employees, and library enthusiasts out there. What specific or bizarre rules have you encountered?

“Single Girl, Married Girl”
Just me and Fran on this one. He's playing his homemade D-18 and I'm playing the O-18. “Single Girl, Married Girl” is the second song the Carters recorded in 1927 and was their first huge hit. The Carters recorded this version on May 8th, 1935 in New York City.
The first time we recorded it, in June 2011, Ben was 14 months now. Now our second son, Pete, is 19 months. We recorded this time with both of them in the room, Pete in his playpen and Ben just hanging out.
At the end of the song Ben asks me to help him find his rocks, and then his calendar–he means calculator, and I don't know why he wants a calculator–and then says irritably, “Everything that I love and that keeps missing and I can't find it, I want to find it and put it somewhere i can find it.”
Which is, like, pretty much how I've felt my whole life. He's inherited my housekeeping and organizational skills, I see.

'We feel insulted': Orthodox community lashes out at wife who turned back on Jewish community and 'left a trail of broken hearts' with explosive memoir
She told the world her story of a loveless arranged marriage and religious restrictions, but now, the Orthodox Jewish community that she left is firing back.
Deborah Feldman, 25, left her ultra-conservative Satmar community in the Williamsburg neighbourhood of Brooklyn more than two years ago, and says she hasn't looked back.
But to her neighbours and former husband, she has left little more than feelings of hurt and betrayal, as her former community says Ms Feldman paints a misleading picture of Hasidic life.
New life: Deborah Feldman renounced her Hasidic upbringing, criticising its oppressive attitude to women. She has since penned a memoir about her old life in New York's Williamsburg
Controversy: Ms Feldman appeared on The View to talk about her life, old and new. Her memoir Unorthodox has sparked a wave of retaliation from the community
Following a whirlwind book tour, including a lengthy interview on ABC's The View, Ms Feldman is blazing her own trail apart from the conservative religious community in which she grew up.
However, her family says things revealed in her memoir, Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots, including that she was trapped in a ‘loveless' marriage, came as news to former husband Joel Feldman.
Mr Feldman's uncle Izzy Berkowitz told the New York Post an entirely different story. ‘(Deborah) was crazy about this boy. She was dying to get married.'
Ms Feldman said on the View that she had known her husband-to-be only half an hour prior to their marriage.
Mr Berkowitz continued: ‘He did everything and anything for her, but she never appreciated anything no matter what he did.'
He speculated that she ‘lacked happiness' and could never be content. Another neighbour in the conservative Williamsburg community said Mr Feldman felt ‘betrayed' by Ms Feldman's portrayal of him in her memoir.
In one passage, she writes: ‘Whenever (Joel) feels libidinous… he approaches me much in the same way I imagine a dog pounce on a leg of furniture.'
Family front: Deborah Feldman, pictured with her ex-husband and son, when she lived as an ultra-conservative Satmar Hasid in Williamsburg
‘We feel insulted,' neighbour Pear Engelman said of Ms Feldman's book. ‘It paints the whole community in a bad light.'
In one passage of the memoir, she writes of a shocking tale in which a 13-year-old Satmar boy is murdered by his father for masturbating, and the whole gruesome story is covered up by the Orthodox volunteer ambulance corps Hatzolah.
She wrote that the boy had his penis cut off and was nearly beheaded by his livid father. In defence, New York Jewish Week said the story was in fact about a 19 or 20-year-old man who committed suicide.
When asked about her stance by the Jewish Daily Forward, Ms Feldman replied: ‘I don't have a response. I am not a journalist…You read the book, you saw how I portrayed that story.'
She now lives on Manhattan's Upper East Side with her son, who is almost six.
Mother and son: Ms Feldman with her son, now five. After she gave birth, she knew that she she did not want to raise her child into the strict Satmar community
At just 17, Ms Feldman found herself in an arranged marriage.
Sex was dysfunctional. In an interview with the New York Post , she remembers never hearing the word 'sex' or 'vagina' mentioned and intercourse was a dark, fumbled affair after which her husband called the rabbi who then declared her consummated and 'unclean'.
'If you're sitting on a sofa, you have a divider between you. It makes you feel so gross. You feel like this animal in the room.'
The rabbi has the final word on sex and health - even inspecting underwear 'in a zip lock bag' to declare whether a woman's period is kosher or nonkosher.
For two weeks of each month, her husband was not allowed to touch her, or even come into secondary contact with her. 'If you're sitting on a sofa, you have a divider between you. It makes you feel so gross. You feel like this animal in the room,' she told the newspaper.
In a note from the author, Ms Feldman explains the roots of Satmar Hasidism, a Jewish sect that is largely shielded from modern life - and one that she believes, she told the Post, is no better than extreme Muslim fundamentalism.
Pariah: Her community has disowned her, some encouraged her to commit suicide after leaving Williamsburg. Now, she says she enjoys simple pleasures, like growing her hair long and eating out
A reaction to the atrocities of Holocaust, the sect is named for a Hungarian town that was the home of a rabbi who fled to the U.S.
'Hasidic Jews in America eagerly returned to a heritage that had been on the verge of disappearing, donning traditional dress and speaking only in Yiddish, as their ancestors had done,' she writes.
'Most important, though, Hasidic Jews focused on reproduction, wanting to replace the many who had perished and to swell their ranks once more. To this day, Hasidic communities continue to grow rapidly, in what is seen as the ultimate revenge against Hitler.'
In the book, she describes how she was forbidden from speaking in English and was told that 'impure languages' act as welcome mats 'put out for the devil.'
UNORTHODOX: AN EXCERPT
'I have secrets too. Maybe Bubby knows about them, but she won't say anything about mine if I don't say anything about hers. Or perhaps I have only imagined her complicity; there is a chance this agreement is only one-sided. Would Bubby tattle on me? I hide my books under the bed, and she hides hers in her lingerie, and once a year when Zeidy inspects the house for Passover, poking through our things, we hover anxiously, terrified of being found out. Zeidy even rifles through my underwear drawer. Only when I tell him that this is my private female stuff does he desist, unwilling to violate a woman's privacy, and move on to my grandmother's wardrobe. She is as defensive as I am when he rummages through her lingerie. We both know that our small stash of secular books would shock my grandfather more than a pile of chametz, the forbidden leavening, ever could. Bubby might get away with a scolding, but I would not be spared the full extent of my grandfather's wrath. When my zeide gets angry, his long white beard seems to lift up and spread around his face like a fiery flame. I wither instantly in the heat of his scorn. “Der tumeneh shprach!” he thunders at me when he overhears me speaking to my cousins in English. An impure language, Zeidy says, acts like a poison to the soul. Reading an English book is even worse; it leaves my soul vulnerable, a welcome mat put out for the devil.'

She told the Post that the emphasis on faith was so all-pervading that every day she was forced to put her life into the hands of God - and health and safety was all but ignored by her family and friends.
She rode in a car without a seatbelt, never visited a doctor and was made to respect all older Hasid men, even if they posed a threat to her wellbeing.
She suggests that at age 12, she was sexually assaulted by a cousin and was made to feel it was her problem: 'It's obviously all your fault and not his, and you need to keep quiet about it,' she told the newspaper.
In her memoir, she recalls hiding her contraband Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott books: ' Once a year when Zeidy [grandfather] inspects the house for Passover, poking through our things, we hover anxiously, terrified of being found out. Zeidy even rifles through my underwear drawer. Only when I tell him that this is my private female stuff does he desist, unwilling to violate a woman's privacy'.
Stories of a different world - promises of hope and glimpses into what could be - the books opened the author's eyes to a future beyond Satmar Hasidism.
It was the birth of her son, now five, combined with the classes she had enrolled in at Sarah Lawrence College, that flicked a switch in the young Brooklyinte's head - she knew that there was more to life.
A car near-fatal crash was the final straw, and on leaving the hospital, she packed her bags and moved in with her college friend.
Throwing herself into life as a young, independent single mother, Ms Feldman is set on making up for lost time - relishing the simplicities of day-to-day living that she was denied in her ultra-conservative upbringing.
Ms Feldman describes how much she enjoys visiting restaurants.
Memoirs of a Hasid: Her old life far behind her, Ms Feldman has enjoyed the support of College friends. It was a car crash that finally tipped her over the edge
'I think I love eating out more than most people,' she says, 'because I was never allowed to do it. Women aren't allowed to eat out.'
Hair is another area in which she relishes having freedom. For a year, she followed the Satmar expectation of women to shave their heads and wear wigs. 'I have a hard time cutting my hair now, because I remember how long it took to grow it out the first time,' she says.
Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of my Hasidic Roots, by Deborah Feldman is out of February 14
Her clothing was as restrictive as her language - at 11-years-old, dressing rules became stricter, she told the Post, forcing girls to 'only wear high-neck blouses, with woven fabrics, because their theory is that woven fabrics don't cling. T-shirts show boobs.'
Swimming suits were 'ridiculous' full-body cladding, consisting of 'nylon fabric and thick, floppy, long sleeves, and pants covered with an extra layer of material to make it look like a skirt.'
She now celebrates her body and womanly curves, wearing short dresses and comfortable knits.
The decision to leave Hasidism and her family - she now has primary custody of her son - she says, was not made lightly. She received emails from her closest relatives encouraging her to commit suicide and says she is now a pariah - but that the book acts as 'protection'.
'[My relatives] are terrified of having their actions become public. So it's an insurance policy, in a way.
'There's a reason why Hasidic people in New York get away with so much. There's this sort of tacit arrangement: They don't do anything the media can criticize,' she told the Post.
The new Xcode 9.1 beta has also been released by Apple today with support for the new operating system updates: iOS 11.1, watchOS 4.1 and tvOS 11.1. It also includes a more fully-fledged iPhone X simulator, which demonstrates the new lock screen and home screen experiences.
There are also some onboarding videos, for things like activating Siri or revealing Control Center, which will be shown to iPhone X users upon setup …

Whilst the simulator OS was in a bit of a weird shape in Xcode 9, the Xcode 9.1 iPhone X simulator much more closely reflects what iOS will look like on the new edge-to-edge rounded screen.
This gives us our first close-up look at the home screen and lock screen experience for iPhone X.
On the home screen, Apple ditches the attached appearance for the Dock with a new iPad-like design that follows the rounded corners of the physical screen.
Unlike the iPad, the Dock is limited to a total of four apps, the same as the standard iPhone.
The lock screen has more major components to look at, including a couple details that weren't present at Apple's September event. For starters, the iconic hint text now reads ‘Swipe up to open'.
The home indicator, the persistent thin bar at the bottom of the screen, also gently animates up and down to further suggest to users how they should unlock and interact with an iPhone without a physical home button.
You can see the grayed out camera shortcut here too; as this is a simulator it doesn't connect to an actual camera so the icon is in the disabled state. On a real iPhone X, there will also be a flashlight shortcut on the left side of the screen. Users press firmly (3D Touch) on these buttons to activate them.
If you also look at the top right of the screen, in the right ear, you can also see a mini Control Center icon paired with another pull-down indicator. This is another interface hint for how users find Control Center on the iPhone X; by pulling down on the right side of the status bar.
On the simulator, the Control Center interface doesn't actually work but you can see how the status bar disappears and a new row of status items appears below the notch area. This includes the carrier name and battery percentage.
Guilherme Rambo has also uncovered a series of onboarding videos that Apple will show new iPhone X users to introduce them to the various new interaction metaphors, from the swipe gestures to the new side button actions.

Is Jon Snow going to fall for another redhead? Kit Harington teases what's next for his Game of Thrones character in a brief and spoiler-free Q&A below.
When we last saw the Stark bastard in season 4, he had triumphantly helped defend The Wall from the Wildling invaders—yet lost his love Ygritte (Rose Leslie) in the fighting. With Wildling leader Mance Rayder (Ciaran Hinds) captured, Snow is dealing with a new authority figure: self-proclaimed king Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane), as well as his witchy mistress Melisandre (Carice van Houten).
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: You had a really strong performance last season, and it seems like you get all the toughest locations—you're always out in the cold.
Kit Harington: This year I don't think I did one scene in the [Thrones‘ studio hanger]. It was all on location. I don't mind it. It sucks sometimes, but I always feel slightly sterile when I'm in a studio. I quite like location work. It always feels more like Thrones when you're out in the cold and rain.
What's your overall impression of the season?
I think this is the first season I've topped Peter [Dinklage] in having the most shoot dates on the calendar. There's a lot of Jon in there. I'm really proud of this season. I think across the board it's going to be very, very strong. I watched The Sopranos, and season 5 was the favorite, and we were modeled after The Sopranos—so hopefully it will be a good one.
How have last year's events changed Jon?
He doesn't have time to mourn. We saw him mourn at the end of last season, when he burns Ygritte. And this season he only mentions her once—in a scene where he's being come onto by Melisandre. He's got bigger things at hand. If he's missing her, it's internal. He's hardened, in some ways, this season. He's also got to play more politics this season, which he's not good at. He's lost his love, but he's also lost his brother, his father, his stepfather. He thinks he's lost both stepsisters and his other brothers too. He's used to loss and he's gotten good at dealing with it.
How does he feel toward Melisandre?
He's incredibly intrigued by her. I find it endlessly funny that he really fancies redheads. One dies, and another comes along, and he's all, “Hello!” There's mutual interest between them that we see right from the get-go. There's definitely a future there this season, with him and her. Who knows what Melisandre sees in people, but she's obviously obsessed with bastards and noble blood. There's obviously something a bit special about him in this story, and she locks in on that. So this season she tries to seduce him. That's her power play. It's going to be an interesting battle!
You talked last season how he's always had a father figure until then, but now Stannis has come along. So whats that relationship like?
That was really interesting to me. He's always had paternal figures, a patriarch. He's aways had somebody giving him advice or mentoring him. Stannis comes along and you expect that to happen again. But it's very much not that. Jon is sick and tired of that, he feels like he's grown into a man and doesn't want advice anymore. So right or wrong, when Stannis tries to give him advice, he pushes back from that. I almost played it as me, Kit, that I'm tired of having storylines like that and tried to feed that into that Jon and how it was written—that I'm not going to take advice from an older and more stately person.
Brazil duo Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho have the potential to form a devastating double act at Liverpool, according to their legendary compatriot, Ronaldinho.
The Reds secured the signing of Firmino from Hoffenheim on Wednesday morning, with the 23-year-old becoming the fifth deal the club have agreed so far this summer.
Ronaldinho is backing the forward to help torment opposition defences in the Barclays Premier League and tally up plenty of assists alongside Coutinho.
He said: "For Liverpool to have Coutinho and Firmino is a big achievement for them. It is going to give them one of the most exciting midfields in Europe.
"The creativity, intelligence and goals they have between them can change Liverpool as a team. It is a big sign of intent.
"It is a dream for the Liverpool strikers to have that sort of service. They will create so many chances."
The current protests in Hong Kong for democracy reflects only part of the issues facing Chinese cities, as they grow and become ever more sophisticated. In just four decades, China has gone from 17.4 percent to 55.6 percent urban, adding nearly 600 million city residents. And this process is far from over: United Nations projections indicate that over the next 20 years, China's urban population will increase by 250 million, even as national population growth rates slow and stall.
Overall this transition has been spectacularly successful. As it has urbanized, China, following the lead of Hong Kong, has become a much richer country, expanding its share of global GDP from 2 percent in 1995 to 12 percent in 2012.
China now boasts four megacities of over 10 million people, the most of any country. The population of Shanghai, a cosmopolitan world city decades before the Communist takeover of the country, has expanded almost 50% since 2000, and the ancient capital Beijing and the southern commerce and industrial hub of Guangzhou have grown nearly as rapidly. The U.N.'s growth projections suggest that the future list of megacities will include Chongqing, Tianjin and Chengdu.
Shenzhen, one of the four current megacities, epitomizes the speed of China's urbanization. A small fishing village along the Hong Kong border with a few factories when I first visited three decades ago, the city rose as the focus of Deng Xiaoping's first wave of modernization policies. In 1979 it had roughly 30,000 people; now it is a thriving metropolis of 13 million whose population in the past decade grew 56%. Its rise has been so recent and quick that the Asia Society has labeled it “a city without a history.”
Shenzhen has not only grown but thrived over the past three decades, as was evident on my most recent trip. In contrast to the often impoverished slum cities of the developing world, China's cities have grown much as Britain's did in the 19th century, upon the back of rapid expansion of manufacturing and trade. This sets Chinese urbanization apart from India‘s; manufacturing's share of Indian GDP is half that of China. In the process, Chinese cities have become more tied to the global economy, exposing its people to international trends, as well as greater affluence. This is exactly what has happened earlier in Hong Kong, setting the stage for some of the recent unrest. At the same time, the leading cities of the West are, for the most part, barely growing, and much of that by dint of immigration. With plunging birthrates and generally anemic economies, the great cities of the Europe and North America are hardly likely to blaze a brash urban trail; they are more concerned with retaining what they can from their historical inertia. There is no city in the West — even Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth — that approaches the dynamism one now finds in China.
The Coming Chinese Urban Economic Crisis
China's successful urban transformation now faces a challenge as the country's export-led economy weakens. Labor costs are soaring and young adults, some four times as many of whom have attended college than those who came of age a decade ago, have little interest in factory work. At the same time, many of China's most successful and talented people are seeking out lives abroad; two-thirds of the country's affluent residents, according to one survey, are considering migrating overseas.
The labor crunch is most intense in China's coastal cities, home to most of the urban population. These face greater competition from less expensive urban areas further west, such as Chongqing and Chengdu. But even these areas are facing a labor shortage, forcing companies to fill their ranks with not necessarily voluntary student laborers. There is also growing competition as well in labor-intensive industries like textiles from cheaper cities in places like Vietnam, Indonesia and Bangladesh.
Recent attacks by Beijing on multinationals, charging them for corruption and anti-trust violations, could make things worse. For political reasons, the government has decided to persecute the very companies that account for half of Chinese exports, charging corruption and anti-trust violation. China, where ironically the public is more favorable than most Westerners to large corporations, now faces an investment downturn as foreign companies look for safer havens such as in Mexico or to come back to the U.S.
The logical solution to this challenge, particularly for coastal Chinese cities, is to move up the value chain, much as Hong Kong and Singapore have already done. This means a greater reliance on finance, business services and technology. Shenzhen, for example, looks to Silicon Valley as a role model. But their attempt is taking place in an urban environment very different than that nurtured in California suburban garages. Instead we see typically immense infrastructure projects like the 15 square kilometer Qianhai development near the city's main port. Qianhai hopes to lure service and tech employment from pricier, and for now, more unstable Hong Kong.
But in many cases, high-value industries depend on open access to information, something Beijing clearly sees as a threat to the political order; China's great Internet Firewall is getting, if anything, higher and more difficult to breach, to the detriment of local knowledge workers. Government authorities realize that Hong Kongers' access to western media, movies and culture makes them less pliable than those, even in neighboring Shenzhen, where access to major foreign publications, Google and many websites is highly restricted.
Health And Demographics
China is not only urbanizing, but doing it at extreme levels of density; barely four to six percent of all new floor space in the country goes to single-family houses. Even on the suburban periphery, there are few low-rise apartment buildings and even fewer houses; much of the construction, particularly for rural migrants, is also substandard, with buildings erected so close that sometimes residents of one can shake the hands of those next to it.
This has created a series of health problems. Dense urbanization, notes a recent Chinese study, has led to more obesity, particularly among the young, who get less exercise, and spend more time desk-bound. Stroke and heart disease have become leading causes of death.
Perhaps the best known result from intensified urbanization can be seen outside any window: pervasive air pollution. Beijing and Shanghai rank among the most polluted major cities in the world, just behind Delhi. This problem has become so severe that it has led, even in authoritarian China, to grass-roots protests, many of them targeted at new industrial plants and other facilities near cities such as Shanghai, Dalian, and Hangzhou.
More serious still has been the impact on birth rates. Even though the government has been relaxing its long-held “one child” policy, the density of Chinese cities continues to help suppress birthrates. This relationship between density and low fertility can also be seen in similarly crowded Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, where there is no official limit on having more than one child. In Hong Kong some 45% of middle-class couples have abandoned the idea of having children, not surprising since the cost of raising a child is now estimated at over $700,000, more than twice than in the United States.
Given high prices relative to incomes, and dense conditions, Chinese cities appear to follow the same pattern, which over time is almost certain to slow economic growth as the population of elderly grows and the workforce shrinks. Already, notes National University of Singapore demographer Gavin Jones, the fertility rate of women in Shanghai has fallen to 0.7, among the lowest ever reported, well below the “one child” mandate and barely one-third the number required simply to replace the current population. Overall, the Chinese urban fertility rate is a weak 1.08.
The Future
Rather than look at the current unrest in Hong Kong as a singular example, we should understand that many problems faced in the former British colony are increasingly felt as well in mainland China. As cities reach middle class status and land prices soar, they need to move up the value scale, but this is very difficult to do under a fundamentally authoritarian system.
While authoritarian structures can work in an industrial city, they may be less effective in a more information-based economy, in which companies need to adjust to rapidly changing attitudes and trends. The problem here is that, in an authoritarian state, controls over information are often deemed mandatory; in a sense, in an information-dependent economy, this is like trying to run a car with watered down gasoline. At the same time, the health effects of dense urbanism, and the massive pollution of the surrounding countryside, augur poorly for many of the largest Chinese cities, which will be forced to compete not only with more open economies, but with lower-cost cities across the developing world.
Ultimately, China, whose urban growth has been a great success story, now must consider changing development patterns, perhaps looking at lower density and more dispersed development. One promising sign is that China's smaller cities, particularly in the West, are now growing faster — with encouragement from Beijing authorities — than megacities. Recently released 2014 population estimates indicate reductions in the annual growth rates of both Shanghai and Beijing.
Ultimately, a shift towards dispersion — both within regions and between them — could have a many positive effects. It would allow people more living space, and if employment also was spread out, a quicker and less rigorous commute, with related benefits gained in time and energy conservation. It would greatly help families and children by reducing the need for parents to migrate for work, separating as many as one in five Chinese families.
Clearly, new models are clearly called for, ones that look not only at bulking up cities, but humanizing them. This may be imperative if Beijing would like to avoid the prospect of a future characterized by an aging, alienated and increasingly unhealthy population.

At the age of 35 she requested a secondment to work for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office running the transition of power from occupying Allied forces to a new Iraqi Government in the country.
Emma says she was put in charge of a Province in Iraq and admits she did not have the experience or qualifications to do the job and Iraq ended up with people "doing their best in very difficult circumstances", adding many people who were in the country following the war were inexperienced and admits "we made it up as we went along".

As expected, the NPD revealed its sales numbers for November 2017, and several big releases for the month made a tremendous impact – even Star Wars: Battlefront II, a game many thought would be hurt by its “loot crate” controversy.
According to the company, spending was up to a record high for the month, reaching $2.68 billion – 30 percent higher than November 2016.
But what's more, Call of Duty: WWII, which released on November 3rd, managed to become the best-selling game of 2017 within the frame of one month. “Call of Duty: WWII generated more launch month consumer spending than any Call of Duty debut since the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops II in November 2012,” NPD analyst Mat Piscatella said.
Activision added a statement as well. “According to NPD, based on revenues Call of Duty: WWII is the #1 top selling console video game in North America this year, making Call of Duty the #1 top selling console video game franchise in North America for the 9th year in a row,” said Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision. “As proud as we are of Call of Duty: WWII, we're equally proud that our talented teams have found ways to keep Call of Duty fresh, relevant and on top of the charts for nearly a decade—an amazing feat. Thanks to the greatest fans in the world for their passion and engagement with this awesome franchise.” (This also marks the highest sales for the Call of Duty franchise since Black Ops II released in 2012.)
Hardware sales leaped to $1.147 billion, up 52 percent from the previous year; and console software also saw a 19 percent increase from 2016, up to $1.164 billion.
As for the leader in hardware sales, the PlayStation 4 dominated with its sales, with Sony noting that it's sold more consoles than any other month in the PlayStation 4's lifetime. The Nintendo Switch also performed admirably, as did the SNES Classic Edition. As for the Xbox One X, specific numbers weren't given, but its high-dollar sales were the highest for the month.
“Year to date, hardware spending has grown 28 percent versus 2016 to $3.4B,” said Piscatella. “Consumer spending on Nintendo Switch, Plug N Play devices such as the SNES Classic and the PlayStation 4 continue to fuel growth.”
The top twenty best selling games for the month are below, not accounting for Blizzard.net sales for Destiny 2 or certain areas of the total market spend. Still, it was a big month for Call of Duty: WWII, as well as Star Wars: Battlefront II, which was close behind in second place with a strong start. Assassin's Creed Origins, NBA 2K18 and Madden NFL 18 rounded out the top five.
Call of Duty: WWII Star Wars: Battlefront II Assassin's Creed: Origins NBA 2K18 Madden NFL 18 Super Mario Odyssey FIFA 18 Need for Speed: Payback Destiny 2 Pokémon: Ultra Sun Pokémon: Ultra Moon Middle-earth: Shadow of War Grand Theft Auto V The Sims 4 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Mario Kart 8 Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus South Park: The Fractured But Whole WWE 2K18 Just Dance 2018
Rounding out the report, the NPD noted that PC software saw sales of $33 million for the month, up from $29 million in 2016; and accessories saw an 11 percent increase over the previous year, up to $344 million.
As migrants continue to flow into Europe, certain cities across the continent have seemingly lost their ability to maintain law and order amid a surge in violent crime. The level of violence within the so-called "no-go zones" has risen to a level such that even the police have abandoned efforts to control the streets. According to RT, one particular example is Sweden's third-largest city of Malmo where more than 70 cars were set on fire by arsonists over the past several days. Meanwhile, authorities noted that offenses range from vandalism to drug crimes, sexual assaults and gun violence.
Per recent media reports, there are now as many as 55 “no-go zones” spread throughout several Swedish cities where the police have little to no ability to control rising violence. The surging violence is putting a huge burden on over-worked police officers who are reportedly choosing to quit the force in record numbers. Per RT:
“We have a major crisis. Many colleagues are choosing to quit,” police officer Peter Larsson told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. “A drastically worsened working environment means many colleagues are now looking for other work.”
Recently the city of Malmo faced a string of arsons in which 16 vehicles were torched across the several neighborhoods in just one night. As fire commander, Magnus Johansson, noted the rising violence is exhausting public resources and making it impossible to service the needs of Swedish citizens.
“All our stations are overloaded and the whole of the Malmo force is out extinguishing the car fires,” fire commander Magnus Johansson told SVT. “It is a burden for our organization, but also for other people who really need our help,” he added. The burning of cars continued into the early hours of Friday morning, with a further 11 vehicles torched. A total of nine neighborhoods were affected by the arson attacks.
Meanwhile the Hungarian government recently introduced a website that alleged that as many as 900 "no-go zones" exist in major cities across Europe. The website also warned against mandatory European quotas that only serve to "increase the terrorist risk in Europe."
"The mandatory European quotas increase the terrorist risk in Europe and imperil our culture. Illegal migrants cross the borders unchecked, so we do not know who they are and what their intentions are. We do not know how many of them are disguised and may be terrorists. Those who come to the EU illegally do not respect our laws and do not want to share common cultural values. If we do not act, we will not recognize Europe in a few decades.”
The Hungarian government has long rejected a mandatory quota for the resettlement of migrants and refugees with the Prime Minister calling for border walls to be built along the Bulgarian and Macedonian borders with Greece.
As rising immigration has become a political hot-topic across Europe, many elected officials have dismissed the existence of "no-go zones." Meanwhile, Ingrid Carlqvist, editor-in-chief of Swedish newspaper Dispatch International, told RT that terminology used to describe rising violence is "just semantics" but the fact remains that there are certain areas where "when the police come there, they will get stoned and people will try to set fire to police cars and so on."
No, it's not. This is just semantics. The Swedish authorities don't want to call them ‘no-go zones.' They think that ‘no -go zones' is place where no one can enter. But that is not what normal people mean. They mean that the ambulances can't go there without police escort. When the police come there, they will get stoned and people will try to set fire to police cars and so on. They are lawless areas – and that is what people call ‘no-go zones'. No normal person would ever go inside there. But what we see here is that people in these areas, the people who live there, who are mostly Muslims are actually saying this. When Swedish journalists go in there, they just tell them to “f*** off,” because this is not Sweden. They are trying to impose Sharia law in these areas and they are doing a good job about it. The police could do things: they could go in there and just stop all of it when they set fire to the cars and when they throw stones, they could do something. But the longer they wait, the more impossible this job will be of course, because now we have at least 55 of these zones in Sweden.
But we thought Angela Merkel made it very clear that "we can do this."
The Swedish Arts Council is distributing a new book that compares Israel to apartheid South Africa, according to sources in the American Jewish press. The book was penned by retired diplomat, Ingmar Karlsson.
A Swedish government body assigned $8,985 towards the publishing and distributing of the book "The bride is beautiful but she is married to another man – Zionism – an ideology at the end of the road?” The decision was made last month and the story broke in the Jewish press Friday.
The book conjectures with such rhetoric as “The fundamental difference between South African and Zionist colonialism is the former wanted land and people while the latter only wanted land.” And “Hebrew has a special status, with no consideration” for the Arabic language “the area's original language.”
A committee selected the book out of 1,600 applications for its “high quality in terms of content, from both a technical and editorial viewpoint” and “the reliability of the facts,” a third party source in America learned.
The book contains a quote attributed to Theodor Herzl which the Stockholm-based Swedish Israel Information Center claims is a forgery: “It is essential that the sufferings of Jews become worse. This will assist in the realization of our plans. I have an excellent idea. I shall induce anti-Semites to liquidate Jewish wealth.”

Saudi Arabia is to be the first customer for European planemaker Airbus's A330 Regional medium-haul passenger jet, according to French business paper La Tribune. Saudi Arabian Airlines is expected to announce an order for about 15 A330s at the Le Bouget air show, which opens outside Paris on Monday.
Airbus, which builds its planes in south-west France, has not confirmed the report that Saudi Arabian Airlines is to place the order.
The Saudi airline hopes to almost double its fleet to 200 planes over the next five years,
The news comes as a surprise, according to La Tribune, because a Chinese company was expected to place the first order for the A330.
Discussions continue with Chinese airlines, which could buy about 100 planes according to Airbus chief executive Fabrice Brégier, and other countries, including Iran, may be interested.
The A330 Regional can only fly 5,000 kilometres, compared to the normal Airbus's 11,000 kilometres, but seats 400 people.
That means more passengers can be transported without increasing the number of flights, which should in theory reduce congestion at airports.

A Vancouver man charged with trafficking girls from around the Lower Mainland and forcing them into the sex trade is facing 36 criminal counts after he was arrested for breaching his bail conditions by trying to contact one of his alleged victims. Reza Moazami, 28, was the first British Columbian ever charged with trafficking minors after he was arrested last October at a bawdy house in the southern part of Vancouver's west side. Two underage girls from Metro Vancouver were found in the residence during his arrest, which led to 18 criminal charges. Since then, nine more alleged victims — all teenagers — have been identified by police. Moazami was thrown back in jail on Aug. 9 and charged with another 18 prostitution-related offences. He remains in police custody.

In a blow for multiculturalism and open door migration, a majority of Australian voters believe the country is full and almost half support a partial ban on new Muslim arrivals. The changing approach to immigration Down Under has been highlighted in a new survey that shows that just over 50 per cent of voters agrees that Australia has changed beyond recognition and “sometimes feels like a foreign country.” The Australian Population Research Institute (TAPRI) conducted the polling. The independent organisation claims the results are driven by a rapid change in Australia's ethnic and religious make-up and concerns over quality of life.
6. Saudi Arabia gives citizenship to “robot” but not to women, workers born there
Saudi Arabia has become the first country to give a robot citizenship. The move is an attempt to promote Saudi Arabia as a place to develop artificial intelligence – and, presumably, allow it to become a full citizen. But many pointed out that those same rights aren't afforded to many humans in the country. The robot, named Sophia, was confirmed as a Saudi citizen during a business event in Riyadh, according to an official Saudi press release.[...] She said that people didn't need to be concerned about the rise of artificial intelligence as depicted in Blade Runner and Terminator. “You've been reading too much Elon Musk and watching too many Hollywood movies,” she told Mr Srkin.

Health officials have temporarily shut down a southern West Virginia pizza restaurant after a district manager was caught on surveillance video urinating into a sink.
Local media reported that the Mingo County health department ordered the Pizza Hut in Kermit, about 85 miles southwest of Charleston, to shut down.
Pizza Hut Corp. released a statement saying it was "embarrassed" by the manager's actions. The company says it has "zero tolerance" for violations of its operating standards. The employee was fired. His name was not released.
The video shows the manager urinating in a sink in the kitchen.
Pizza Hut says the incident occurred after business hours.
County health official Brett Vance says the restaurant is closed until it is thoroughly cleaned and there are reassurances of safeguards in place.
The goals of the present study are fivefold. First, I document a striking and incontrovertible phylogenetic example of the re‐evolution of a complex morphological trait: the re‐evolution of lost mandibular teeth in the frog genus Gastrotheca. In some ways, this example is well known in the older, pre‐phylogenetic herpetological literature (e.g., Boulenger 1882 ; Noble 1931 ; Trueb 1973 ), but it has not been explicitly tested, nor brought into recent discussions of Dollo's law (e.g., Collin and Miglietta 2008 ; Goldberg and Igic 2008 ). Second, I use a time‐calibrated phylogeny to show that the time‐scale over which this reversal occurs is remarkable. Although most previous studies on Dollo's law have not considered the temporal scale over which trait re‐acquisition occurs, I review previous studies and show that the time frame of trait re‐evolution is generally similar across these examples, with Gastrotheca mandibular teeth providing a striking exception. Third, I discuss a general mechanism that may help explain how re‐evolution after this lengthy period of absence is possible. Fourth, I discuss several issues that may make violations of Dollo's law challenging to detect, such that these violations may actually be most difficult to infer under conditions when they are most likely to occur. Finally, I discuss the re‐evolution of mandibular teeth in frogs (and lack thereof) as a possible example of developmental constraint.
Recently, Goldberg and Igic (2008) suggested that violation of Dollo's law is a “spectacular claim” (p. 2730) and that many of these examples may simply be the result of “devastating flaws” (p. 2727) in the methods used. Specifically, they suggested that previous studies were compromised by assumptions about state frequencies at the root of these phylogenies and by failure to account for the possible impact of the character on patterns of diversification (speciation and extinction). However, two subsequent studies that accounted for both of these issues still found strong support for re‐evolution of lost structures ( Lynch and Wagner 2010 ; Kohlsdorf et al. 2010 ), and Goldberg and Igic (2008) did not actually test the ability of methods to detect when Dollo's law was violated (i.e., they only simulated cases in which Dollo's law was true). Galis et al. (2010) have also questioned the evidence for re‐evolution of lost digits (but see Kohlsdorf et al. 2010 ). Overall, despite an increasing number of studies that suggest Dollo's law can be violated, the question of whether lost complex traits can re‐evolve is still in doubt, and indisputable examples are needed (if they can be found).
The loss of complex structures is a common feature of evolution. For example, among the vertebrates, humans and frogs have lost a functional tail, most snakes have lost their limbs, and birds and turtles have lost their teeth. Dollo's law ( Gould 1970 ) states that once such complex features are lost, they will not be re‐acquired with the same form (review in Collin and Miglietta 2008 ).

China's first space station, Tiangong-1, is doomed to plummet into Earth's atmosphere within the coming months, IFL Science reports.
Tiangong-1, which means “The Heavenly Palace," was launched into orbit back in 2011. This relatively small 10.3-meter-long (34-foot) space station was China's first space-laboratory module, making it a major milestone in their drive to become a science superpower.
However, after fulfilling its historic mission, its communication links fell silent in March 2016 and its mission was terminated. Now, the space station is returning from the heavens after idly orbiting Earth for the past few months.
Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told The Guardian on Friday: “Now that [its] perigee is below 300 kilometers [186 miles] and it is in denser atmosphere, the rate of decay is getting higher.”
“I expect it will come down a few months from now – late 2017 or early 2018.” – Jonathan McDowell
In August, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) issued a statement saying Tiangong-1 would re-enter at some point between October 2017 and April 2018.
“Most of the structural components of Tiangong-1 will be destroyed through burning during the course of its re-entry,” added UNOOSA. “The probability of endangering and causing damage to aviation and ground activities is very low.”
Wu Ping, deputy director of China's manned space engineering office, also told a press conference last year: "Based on our calculation and analysis, most parts of the space lab will burn up during falling."
However, it is possible that small pieces of debris no larger than 100 kilograms (220 pounds) will reach Earth's surface, according to McDowell. Far bigger man-made objects have previously made uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere without too much drama. Most notably, Russia's space station Mir – weighing a hefty 120,000 kilograms (265,000 pounds) – plummeted to Earth in 2001.
While you should not expect a spectacular crash, it does mean you might be able to see streaks of debris from Tiangong-1 burn up in Earth's atmosphere. You can track the location and progress of Tiangong-1 through the website Heavens-Above, although the exact date of its return to Earth remains unknown for now.

Until the night of an office Christmas party in 1957, Wayne Ritchie was a Marine Corps veteran, a deputy U.S. marshal and a solid citizen. Overcome by what he later described as depression and a delusion that everyone had turned against him, he tried to hold up a bar that night in San Francisco's Fillmore District.
Spared a prison sentence, Ritchie quit his job in disgrace, spent years fighting off suicidal urges and for more than three decades lived with guilt and self-contempt -- until a 1999 newspaper article propelled him into federal court with a lawsuit against the U.S. government that could soon go to trial.
The article was an obituary of Sidney Gottlieb, director of a CIA mind- control project called MKULTRA, in which LSD and other drugs were given to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans during the Cold War. Ritchie believes he may have been one of the guinea pigs, especially after the diary of a federal agent involved in MKULTRA showed he may have been at the same 1957 Christmas party attended by Ritchie.
Ritchie, now 75 and living in San Jose, "felt that a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders," said psychiatrist James S. Ketchum in a report filed in federal court this April. "He wept when he called his brother with the news."
Ketchum's report, based on six hours of interviews with Ritchie last year, a review of the case records and research on drugs and the CIA, concluded the federal marshal had been a victim of the "covert administration of LSD or an LSD-like substance."
Government lawyers said their own psychiatric expert had determined Ritchie was probably drunk and certainly wasn't on LSD. They accused Ritchie of concocting the drugging theory to cash in on publicity about MKULTRA, the subject of congressional hearings in the 1970s and a 1997 movie, "Conspiracy Theory."
But a new ruling by a federal judge in San Francisco may have removed the major obstacles to a trial of the former marshal's $12 million damage suit. The suit claims invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision of government employees.
MIND CONTROL
MKULTRA, the government's search for chemicals or techniques to control human consciousness, was largely a response to reports of brainwashing of American prisoners during the Korean War.
According to congressional testimony and other records, the CIA and federal narcotics agents started giving mind-altering drugs to prison volunteers as well as unsuspecting government employees and private citizens in the early 1950s and continued to do so for at least a decade.
"We tested these drugs in bars, in restaurants, in so-called massage parlors, any place where there was a drink and people were eating and drinking, " said MKULTRA operative Ike Feldman in a 1999 documentary on the Arts and Entertainment cable network.
Because of the secrecy and destruction of records, many victims were never told what happened to them, said Ritchie's lawyer, Sidney Bender.
One unwitting subject, Army chemist Frank Olson, jumped to his death from a hotel window in 1953 under the influence of LSD that had been slipped into a glass of Cointreau. Congress approved a $750,000 payment to his widow in 1976.
The U.S. government later paid a total of $750,000 to settle a suit by nine Canadians who learned they had been the subjects of MKULTRA experiments during psychiatric treatment in the mid-1950s.
SUIT FAILED AT TRIAL
At least one lawsuit has gone to trial. It ended in a government victory in 1999. The suit was filed by Bender on behalf of the daughter of Stanley Glickman, an American art student who suffered hallucinations and long-lasting psychiatric damage after being given a drink by a fellow American in Paris in 1952.
Before his death in 1992, Glickman said the stranger who gave him the drink resembled the club-footed Gottlieb, but a New York federal jury that examined government travel records decided Gottlieb had not been in Paris at the time.
Ritchie's case may depend on the whereabouts of a man named George White, who in 1957 was a federal Bureau of Narcotics agent and ran MKULTRA in the Bay Area.
White kept a diary that read, for the day in question, "home flu -- xmas party Fed bldg Press Room." White was never asked about the entry before his death in 1975, and its meaning is disputed by the opposing sides. Ritchie argues the entry shows White either attended the party or was in touch with other agents who were there. The government says it shows White stayed home.
Ritchie, then 30, had been a deputy marshal since 1954 after five years in the Marines and a little over a year as a prison guard at Alcatraz. At the party, he downed four or five bourbon and sodas over several hours, then returned to the marshal's office and started feeling strange.
"I became depressed and was overcome with a sense that all my friends and acquaintances had turned against me," he said in a court declaration. He went outside -- where, according to the psychiatrist's report, he seemed to be walking in a tunnel without effort and with increasing feelings of paranoia -- and stopped at several bars, where he conceived the idea of getting money for his girlfriend to buy a plane ticket to New York, something she had once mentioned in jest.
HOLDING UP THE BAR
He retrieved his two service revolvers, drove to the Fillmore bar, demanded money, got distracted and was hit over the head and knocked unconscious. When police arrived, he tearfully asked one officer if he could spare a bullet and save the state some money.
A Chronicle story two days later was headlined, "Good Guy Fails as Bad Guy. " Ritchie pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and was fined $500 and given a suspended sentence.
"He remained severely depressed for at least six years, and experienced disturbing flashbacks and nightmares," said Ketchum's psychiatric report. "His self-esteem was destroyed, and his lifestyle changed from that of an outgoing, cheerful and ambitious marshal to that of a guilt-ridden, self-depriving, subdued house painter, with recurrent suicidal urges."
Ritchie painted houses for 34 years before retiring in 1992, and now lives with his wife on his union pension and Social Security. He said his lawyer has told him not to discuss the case.
In her ruling rejecting the government's attempt to dismiss the suit, Chief U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said the usual deadline for such personal-injury claims -- two years after the injury occurred -- might not apply to Ritchie's suit more than 40 years after the Christmas party. She said the evidence could show that, because of government concealment, Ritchie had no reason to know what had happened to him before reading the 1999 obituary.
"A reasonable person who had never used LSD would not think he had been exposed to it," the judge said in her July 1 decision. She noted that Ritchie denied previous knowledge of MKULTRA and that the government destroyed records of the program in the 1970s.
JOB DESCRIPTION
The government also sought dismissal on the grounds that the alleged injury occurred while Ritchie was on duty at the Christmas party and was covered, at most, by workers' compensation benefits, which Ritchie never sought. But Patel said the normal risks of a marshal's job do not include involuntary drugging by the CIA.
Patel did not discuss whether the evidence presented so far supported Ritchie's LSD claim. In a case that concerns decades-old events with scanty records and few living witnesses, that question might not be resolved even by a trial -- which, under the federal law on damage suits against the government,
would be conducted by Patel without a jury.
The Justice Department is making a final attempt to dismiss the suit without a trial by arguing that Ritchie has presented no evidence, beyond speculation, that federal agents caused his injuries. The motion is pending before Patel.
The government denies that Ritchie was an MKULTRA subject and says the likely explanation is the one he himself believed for more than 40 years -- that he was drunk. They cite his admission that he often had 12 to 25 drinks on weekend nights at the time and that he had been drinking before the robbery attempt.
Psychiatrist Henry D. Abraham, in a declaration filed by the government, said Ritchie's actions that evening showed few of the known symptoms of LSD use and included "a complicated set of planned behaviors" that would be difficult after taking the drug.
But Ketchum countered that Ritchie had never reacted that way to alcohol before and showed clear signs of LSD intoxication -- a debate that may soon be replayed in court.
WASHINGTON -- The Army said Friday that a suspect in the Dallas shooting served in the Army Reserve for six years and did a nine-month tour of duty in Afghanistan.
Police chief: Dallas shooting suspect killed by bomb
CBS News confirmed that the suspect has been identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, 25. Johnson was killed by a robot-delivered bomb in a standoff with police in an El Centro College campus building where he had exchanged fire with officers.
Officials say they believe Johnson was the lone shooter. A law enforcement source told CBS News the suspect was armed with a SKS semi-automatic assault rifle and a handgun, CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton reports. The suspect also wore body armor, the source said.
Dallas police say they found bomb-making materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition, and a personal journal of combat tactics Friday at Johnson's home in Mesquite, about 30 minutes east of Dallas. He is believed to have shared the home with family members.
They say detectives are in the processing of analyzing the information contained in the journal.
Authorities apparently finished an initial search of the home Friday. Agents in Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives vests were seen on Friday carrying out several bags.
The Army released a portion of Johnson's service record that said he enlisted in March 2009 and served in the Army Reserve until April 2015. After leaving the Army Reserve, he joined the Individual Ready Reserve. The IRR is where former active duty or reserve soldiers aren't required to train but are kept on Army personnel rolls with the potential of being called to duty. An IRR soldier can volunteer for short tours on active duty.
Johnson was a private first class and at the time he entered the Army gave his home of record as Mesquite, Texas, the Army said.
His military occupational specialty was carpentry and masonry, the Army said.
The Army said Johnson deployed to Afghanistan in November 2013 and returned in July 2014. For that he was given an Afghanistan Campaign Medal with campaign star. He also earned an Army Achievement Medal, an Army Service Ribbon and an Armed Forces Reserve Medal with "M'' Device, among other standard awards for service.
An Army reservist who served with Johnson told CBS News he was "quirky and funny," "quiet," "happy-go-lucky," and "kind of like a child at heart."
"He stayed with his little crowd of close friends and was more or less innocent," the reservist said.
He said Johnson was "very passive, actually."
"I mean I'm in complete disbelief that he would even be capable of such things," the reservist said.
The reservist said he didn't deploy with Johnson's company, but didn't believe they saw combat.
Police say Johnson, who was black, told authorities that he was upset over the police shootings of two black men earlier this week and wanted to exterminate whites, "especially white officers," officials said Friday.
The reservist said Johnson wasn't hostile and didn't seem to hate anyone when he served with him about four years ago. He said Johnson had friends who were white, Hispanic and Asian.
Johnson was known by his family and neighbors as an "Army strong" veteran who loved playground basketball back home in suburban Dallas. Dallas police say that people they interviewed have described him as a loner.
Micah Xavier Johnson, right, is seen in a photo obtained by CBS News.
Johnson graduated from John Horn High School in Mesquite, school district officials said.
On what appears to be Johnson's Facebook page, photographs posted by someone who identified herself as a relative showed him in a U.S. Army uniform and holding an unknown object as though it were a weapon.
The relative also left a comment on his birthday in 2014 that called him "definitely Army strong" and an "entertaining, loving, understanding, not to mention handsome friend, brother (and) son."
On Saturday, Johnson posted a video of people slaughtering dolphins to a Black Panther Facebook page.
"Look at the joy on their faces," Johnson wrote. "Why do so many whites (not all) enjoy killing and participating in the death of innocent beings?"
Johnson's Facebook page has since been taken down.
Police officers across the country take extra precautions
Israel Cooper, who knew Johnson, said he went by the name Xavier. Cooper said Johnson had a "cool vibe" and wasn't really political but did seem educated.
He said he played basketball with him at a park near the house. He says, "He would be out there for eight hours. Like it was his job. Just hoopin'."
Cooper said that when he heard the suspect was Johnson, he "was in disbelief because he's just not like a violent or rough dude."
"So I was, 'nah, it's probably another Xavier somewhere, you know,' " Cooper said. "But then, with pictures on the internet and stuff, I'm like 'OK.' "
Cooper added: "It's the quiet ones that just do the most devastating stuff. You never see it coming. But then it's more expected, like 'I should have known.'"
Interior Ministry sources named the arrested man as Dmitry Pimenov - said to be the leader of the Union of Revolutionary Writers, a group protesting against growing consumerism in Russia.
A leaflet signed by the group was found at the site of the explosion.
It said police had traced him from a photograph on the group's website, but added that the investigation into the blast was following several leads.
The explosion ripped through an amusement arcade on the bottom floor of the Manezh shopping and restaurant complex.
An adjacent row of fast food restaurants were showered with broken glass and metal shards, injuring dozens of tourists and late-night shoppers.
"Philistines, we don't like your way of life," the note from the Union of Revolutionary Writers said.
"A hamburger not eaten to the end by the dead consumer is a revolutionary hamburger."
Officials said they had not heard of the group before.
Terrorism fears
The explosion has triggered fears of political violence returning to Russia.
Russian media have suggested it might be linked to Islamic militants who are waging war against Russian rule in the Caucasus or to political battles in Moscow itself.
A third suggestion is the possible settling of scores between rival Mafia groups.
There are large numbers of bomb attacks in Russia each year, often involving criminal groups or business rivals seeking to settle turf battles. This was the second major explosion to rock the Russian capital this year.
Eleven people were injured in an explosion at Moscow's Intourist hotel in April.
The Toronto Maple Leafs bolstered their forwards down the middle by signing Shawn Matthias to a one year contract worth $2.3 million for the 2015-2016 NHL season.
Leafs sign Shawn Matthias. — James Mirtle (@mirtle) July 6, 2015
Matthias, 27, skated with the Vancouver Canucks last season and finished tied for third in goals scored (18) while collecting a total of 27 points (18-9-27) and 16 penalty minutes. The Mississauga, Ontario native has appeared in 408 career NHL games between Vancouver and the Florida Panthers and has collected 131 points (69 goals, 62 assists) to go along with 137 penalty minutes. Matthias was originally drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in the second round (47th overall) of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft.
Matthias will be familiar to new Leafs head coach Mike Babcock as Matthias was formerly in the Detroit Red Wings farm system and was traded in the deal that brought Todd Bertuzzi to Detroit. At 6'4″, 223lbs the 27 year old is the biggest forward for the Toronto Maple Leafs and might suggest the team will look into moving a centreman like Tyler Bozak to clear cap space and continue their planned rebuild. Despite playing in a third line role at times, Matthias is looked upon as an “on the cusp” top six centres. He should help replace some of the goals lost from trading Phil Kessel to the Pittsburgh Penguins.
In a 2007 report by the CNA Military Advisory Board, General Gordon R. Sullivan stated: “People are saying they want to be perfectly convinced about climate science projections…But speaking as a soldier, we never have 100 percent certainty. If you wait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to happen on the battlefield.”
Why do those organs of government that the public normally associates with fighting wars, devote time and effort to an issue that is branded as hogwash by many on the right of the political spectrum, and the exclusive domain of environmental activists on the left? The simple answer: climate change is, actually, a national security threat. It's not just a politically expedient narrative politicians used to convince those that couldn't care less about polar bears, rainforests, or “bugs and bunnies.” It's actually a problem worthy of attention by those whose primary job it is to protect the United States from harm. The following is a brief outline of how and why the U.S. national security community treats climate change the way it does, starting with: The national security establishment in the United States, including the U.S. military and the U.S. intelligence community, understand that climate change is a national security threat, and that we cannot wait for 100% certainty before acting to mitigate and adapt to its effects. But not only do they understand it, they plan for it – considering it's implications in strategic documents like the Quadrennial Defense Review , and setting up an office within the CIA called the Center for Climate Change and National Security . But why?Why do those organs of government that the public normally associates with fighting wars, devote time and effort to an issue that is branded as hogwash by many on the right of the political spectrum, and the exclusive domain of environmental activists on the left? The simple answer: climate change is, actually, a national security threat. It's not just a politically expedient narrative politicians used to convince those that couldn't care less about polar bears, rainforests, or “bugs and bunnies.” It's actually a problem worthy of attention by those whose primary job it is to protect the United States from harm. The following is a brief outline of how and why the U.S. national security community treats climate change the way it does, starting with:
The common definition of a national security threat, and how climate change fits into that definition;
The actual national security implications of climate change;
Why climate change is a national security threat at least as significant as other traditional threats, such as the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials.
The common definition of a national security threat, and how climate change fits into that definition
threats from regions of the world that are either of strategic interest to the United States, or whose instability could ultimately lead to direct threats to the United States. In this context, the national security community considers climate change a “ Unfortunately there is no one, accepted definition of a national security threat. So, we won't end that debate here (sorry). However, simply put, the national security community generally categorizes threats as either: direct, physical threats to the U.S. homeland, or vital U.S. assets and personnel abroad; or indirectthreatsfrom regions of the world that are either of strategic interest to the United States, or whose instability could ultimately lead to direct threats to the United States. In this context, the national security community considers climate change a “ threat multiplier ” (a term first coined by CNA's Military Advisory Board ). This means that climate change exacerbates, or heightens, other threats to the United States.
The actual national security implications of climate change
Climate change as a “threat multiplier” manifests itself through both direct and indirect threats to the United States.
Multiplying direct threats to the U.S. homeland. Numerous climate projections highlight a future of increased extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, storms, and sea level rise in North America, which could devastate coastal communities, energy facilities and areas of the United States that rely on predictable patterns of rainfall. U.S. domestic military installations are also at risk. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is currently assessing how drought, dust storms, forest fires, and rising temperatures, due to climate change, could physically affect military bases across the American Southwest. DoD is also examining the impact of sea level rise on its numerous coastal military installations.
Multiplying indirect threats in regions of the world that are either of strategic interest to the United States, or whose instability could ultimately lead to direct threats to the United States. Just as much of the national security community's concern about climate change revolves around its capacity to multiply indirect threats to the United States or its interests, particularly in regions of the world that the U.S. either sees as key, strategic environments or those whose instability could constitute a threat to the U.S.
For example, climate change threatens to indirectly upset the balance of competing interests in the South China Sea , an area of critical geostrategic importance to the United States, where according to a report from the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) , ships carry $1.2 billion in U.S. trade annually. On top of this, sovereignty over parts of the Sea is bitterly contested by adjacent countries, and the U.S. and China have perennially competed over its control (with the U.S. viewing Chinese expansionism in the sea as a threat to national security, and the security of key allies). For instance, Will Rogers at CNAS states that increased drought days in Asia as a result of climate change could result in reduced hydroelectric productivity in China, which may increase the incentive for China to explore fossil fuels under the South China Sea floor, including in contested areas where the U.S. may support competing claimants – potentially leading to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.
Lastly, climate change can exacerbate the social, economic and environmental stresses that plague fragile states, thus heightening the probability of populations fleeing to other countries, or turning to terrorism and piracy. For example, Somalia and the broader Horn of Africa is in the grip of an extended drought that is likely attributable to climate change . This drought, coupled with other factors such as poor or nonexistent governance, has in the past led to widespread famine. As populations become more and more destitute, the probability that they flee en masse to other countries (if they have the means), or join terrorist enterprises like the al-Qaeda affiliated al-Shabab , increases. In short, climate change threatens to make fragile states even more fragile, which can lead to the potential for violence directed either at the United States, or its partners and allies in these key regions. This concern is so acute that the U.S. Department of Defense, through its Minerva Initiative, is investing considerable resources to map the security implications of climate change in Africa.
Why climate change is a national security threat at least as significant as other traditional national security threats
But, you might ask, do these security threats really compare to other such threats, like the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials? From a security perspective, the answer is yes. Climate change is what risk analysts would call a “high probability, high impact” risk, meaning that it is very likely to occur (between 90 and 97%), and will have a very large and widespread impact on security (for example, the 2011 World Risk Report ranked climate change highest, next to global economic collapse, in this regard). On the other hand, a study commissioned in 2005 by Senator Richard Lugar produced a median response of a 10 percent likelihood of “an attack involving a nuclear explosion” in five years and a 20 percent likelihood in 10 years. Of course, in the case of a nuclear detonation, the price of that 10 or 20 percent likelihood materializing is devastating and unacceptable, so it makes all the sense in the world to prevent it, or adequately prepare for it. But the same goes for climate change, especially given a relatively high degree of certainty about its occurrence, and the scale of its impact over time.
Conclusion
Don't ask me how, but somehow I managed to convince my girlfriend that is been a good idea to buy a Nest Cam to keep an eye on my future-son's bedroom. And if that's not special enough: I even convinced her that it is a good idea to mount it inside the baby crib.
Honestly, I was a bit baffled that she agreed with this idea. But now that I managed to take that first hurdle, it is time to find out how to mount the camera on a safe and esthetically nice way. After unboxing, the Nest Cam is mounded in a metal mount. The mount is screwed to the bottom plate with a 6mm bolt. I could just remove the bottom plate and design something as a replacement.
But after taking a closer look, I noticed the actual camera module is snapped into the metal loop and can easily be removed …
With this in mind, I fired up my favorite CAD tool: Fusion 360 and started drawing the new mount. The crib contains a 8 mm metal rod on which the hood is mounted. So this would be the best place to mount the camera on.
By using two bolts I can firmly clamp the new mount on the metal rod, and have the option to tilt the camera if necessary. The mount contains a 8 mm slot to make sure it will grip onto the rod nice and tightly.
Now that the design is finished, it's time to put my Lulzbot Mini to work. In this case I use White ABS since it's durable, and the white color will help the mount to blend away into the hood. If only Nest would sell a white Camera as well …
After a little bit of waiting and some sanding the printed pieces looked just like I designed them. I know this is the idea behind a 3D-printer, but it still surprises me every time!
With the help of two shortened bolts and two wing nuts I can fit all the pieces together …
And with the camera perfectly snapping in place, I'm convinced this will be a safe and beautiful way to mount the camera in the crib.
Of course I also need to attach the power cord to the rod. A bit of 3D-drawing and printing is all I need for this.
The S-shaped clips firmly snap on the rod and keep the cable in place. Not only does it look nice, but it also prevents my son from hacking into the Camera's firmware.
With everything mounted in place, it sure looks like a nice and safe solution.
And with all the white ABS, most of the work nicely blends away in the background. I'm sure most of the family won't even notice it's there. (And that will probably prevent a lot of comments …)
Now, if we want to make an other Truman Show, this might be a good starting point!
… there still is one thing missing, though!

Charles Manson, one of the most notorious murderers of the 20th century, who was very likely the most culturally persistent and perhaps also the most inscrutable, died on Sunday in a hospital in Kern County, Calif., north of Los Angeles. He was 83 and had been behind bars for most of his life.
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced his death in a news release. In accordance with federal and state privacy regulations, no cause was given; he had been hospitalized in January for intestinal bleeding but was ruled too frail to undergo surgery.
Mr. Manson was a semiliterate habitual criminal and failed musician before he came to irrevocable attention in the late 1960s as the wild-eyed leader of the Manson family, a murderous band of young drifters in California. Convicted of nine murders in all, he was known in particular for the seven brutal killings collectively called the Tate-LaBianca murders, committed by his followers on two consecutive August nights in 1969.
Sweden has often presented itself to the world in the past as a model of social justice and successful integration. For the last week, however, it has been a country of burning tires, schools and automobiles – seemingly, a great divide between pretense and reality.
"Not everything that shines is gold," said Tobias Etzold, from the Northern Europe Project at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) in Berlin. "Even a supposedly model country, like Sweden, with a well-functioning welfare state and relatively affluent population, is not immune to the economic and finance crisis in Europe."
Tensions between rich and poor
'Not everything that shines is gold' in Sweden, says political analyst Tobias Etzold
The riots in the Stockholm suburb of Husby has seriously shaken the idyllic world of the Swedes. Some 12,000 residents live in Husby; 85-percent of them have an immigrant background. More than a third of the 20-25 year olds have no job.
After the last economic crisis in 2008, the Swedish government was forced to implement austerity measures. The economic problems at the time were quickly remedied with reforms, but the financially weaker portion of the population was hit hard. "The government cut unemployment benefits and subsidies for health care, while giving tax breaks to the affluent," explains Etzold.
"That led to a growing social divide between rich and poor," said Almut Möller, from the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), in an interview with DW.
The problems were clearly visible in suburbs, like Husby, he added. The communities were built in the 60s and 70s to provide inexpensive housing. In the beginning, it was poorer Swedes who moved into these areas, but after a while, more and more immigrants began to arrive. "Sweden has a liberal immigration policy, so today, the proportion of migrants is very high," he added.
The Swedes moved away and the immigrants stayed. When the unemployment rate rises in areas where people have less access to education and work, then the unrest is greater, he said. "And Sweden's youth unemployment rate of 24-percent is well above the EU average," Möller added.
Latent disposition for violence
It now remains to be seen if the government responds to the problems
The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was the shooting death of a 69-year-old immigrant by the police, who claimed they acted in self-defense. "Without this incident the situation probably would not have escalated," says Martin Diewald, a sociologist at the University of Bielefeld in Germany. Events, like that often unleash the latent propensity for violence under the surface," he said.
"For a group that sees itself as being discriminated against, aggressions bubble to the surface when something like this happens because respect and recognition have been refused to them," Diewald said.
Failed integration program
Meanwhile, the police have the rioters under control. In the long term, Etzold thinks the unrest could improve the situation in the suburbs. "Policymakers were surprised by the violence because they neglected the problems in these neighborhoods for a long time. Possibly, the situation will lead to a growing awareness that the government needs to do more," he said.
Sweden's much-touted integration program has failed in Etzold's view and the state will have to invest more in education and the job market. That's the only way Sweden can regain its reputation as a model country, he maintains. At the moment, says Etzold, "that model is more a cliché than reality."
Russia rejects in the strongest possible terms allegations that it supports President Assad in the Syrian conflict. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Moscow and Beijing must 'pay a price' for backing Assad.
“I do not believe that Russia and China are paying any price at all – nothing at all – for standing up on behalf of the Assad regime. The only way that will change is if every nation represented here directly and urgently makes it clear that Russia and China will pay a price,” Clinton warned.­
Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said the west is operating within a friend-or-foe framework that he called outmoded.
“We categorically reject that such a question would even be posed regarding the current situation in Syria and Russia's ‘backing' of President Bashar Assad. This is not a question of supporting certain political figures or leaders. This is a question of managing a crisis situation in the country within a normal political framework,” Ryabkov said.
“Unfortunately, we're unable to get a basic understanding from our western partners. The west is still appealing to “friend-or-foe” terms. We considered such terminology to be a thing of the past,” Ryabkov explained.
Russia and China once again opted not to attend the “Friends of Syria” meeting. Neither Moscow nor Beijing believe the meeting in the French capital will be helpful in uniting the Syrian opposition “on a constructive basis”.
“We have frankly laid out the reasons why we have restrained from joining the mechanism, the very name of which has a contradiction between the word and the deed,” Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this week.
The US Secretary of State further criticized Russia for the maintenance of Syria's Soviet-made helicopters. Two weeks ago Hillary Clinton lashed out at Russia for repairing three Syrian helicopters, saying their presence “will escalate the conflict quite dramatically.”
The Russian Foreign Ministry swiftly refuted the allegations.
“In 2008 there was a contract to repair them. They are still to be assembled after delivery'', Lavrov said. ''That entire process will take at least three months. So to speak about something we have just sold to Syria, which is then to be used in action, is not true at all,” he added.
Meanwhile, Kofi Annan called on the West and Russia to lay aside their differences and work towards a sooner end to the Syrian bloodshed, which according to the UN latest estimates, has taken some 15,000 lives.
"They [the West] accuse the Russians of arming the [Syrian] government. The Russians accuse them of arming the opposition and flooding the place with weapons. This is instead of coming together to see what can be done," Annan told the Guardian on Friday.
US to seek another UN Security Council resolution
­The Paris conference wrapped up with a six-point resolution, affirming that more definitive UN Security Council action is required to resolve the 16-month conflict in Syria.
Hillary Clinton said the lack of compliance with Annan's peace plan or obstruction to the transition should be punished with further sanctions.
"We should go back and ask for a resolution in the Security Council that imposes real and immediate consequences for non-compliance, including sanctions," ranging from economic measures to military force, she said.
Two previous UNSC resolutions have been vetoed by China and Russia.
Friends of Syria's meeting also concluded with an agreement that the Syrian opposition should receive broader support, while those “who carry out and support repression” must face tougher and wider sanctions.
In the meeting, French President Francois Hollande demanded Assad step down. The Syrian opposition also called for humanitarian corridors and a no-fly zone to be implemented.
The Friends of Syria gathering comes just a week after a UN-led summit in Geneva where the international community endeavored to reach a consensus on the conflict. They agreed to get behind UN envoy Kofi Annan's plan for a transition government in Syria.
However, Russia said that western powers were purposely distorting the terms of the agreement to push for the removal of Assad.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed that the agreement said Assad must leave office, whereas Moscow claims that the original accord made no allusion to the removal of the Syrian president.
MANILA, Philippines — The head of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) has questioned the claim of his counterpart in the Philippine National Police that the number of rape-slay cases and other crimes increased when the PNP was pulled out of the war against illegal drugs.
PDEA director general Aaron Aquino said it was wrong for PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa to conclude that criminality is on the rise just because they are no longer involved in the fight against drugs.
Aquino said Dela Rosa has no one else to blame if there is a rise in rape-slay cases as it falls within PNP's anti-criminality responsibilities, even if they are out of the war on drugs.
“It is their responsibility. Let us be clear that anti-criminality is their job, it is not ours. If there was an increase in the supply and demand on illegal drugs, that's our problem, but if there was an increase in crime like rape, it is not our problem,” Aquino said on Monday.
Dela Rosa earlier this month expressed alarm over the increase of rape-slay cases, which occurred after the PNP was taken out of the war on illegal drugs.
Dela Rosa cited the case of 22-year-old Mabel Cama, a bank employee who was reportedly raped, killed and her body set on fire in Pasig City.
The PNP was pulled out of the drug war amid allegations of abuse and extrajudicial killings in their anti-illegal drug operations.
President Duterte directed the PNP, National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Bureau of Customs, Philippine Postal Corp. and other agencies to refrain from spearheading drug operations to avoid conflict in an order dated Oct. 10.
Dela Rosa claimed the people involved in the killings are high on drugs, an allegation which Aquino was quick to refute.
“What was their basis for that? If there is rape, the offender was high on drugs? Give me the basis and statistics to prove those claims,” Aquino said.
Aquino added that while he wished for the PNP to return to the campaign against drugs, this does not mean that there will no longer be rape cases, as evidenced by their combined performance before the order was issued.
“Was the number of rape cases reduced when the PNP and PDEA jointly led the war on drugs?” Aquino remarked.
The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) said they monitored fewer incidents of killings when the PDEA took over the government's campaign against illegal drugs.
“We have noticed that when the campaign was transferred to PDEA, while (the killings) did not stop, the number of deaths has decreased,” CHR Chairman Chito Gascon said.
“We are hoping that with the return of the police in the operations against drugs, they will follow operational procedures on use of force and hopefully the number of deaths will not increase,” he added.
Gascon made the statement in reaction to Duterte's directive for the PNP to retake the lead in the war on drugs from PDEA.
Gascon urged law enforcement agencies to ensure that they follow operational procedures, particularly the guidelines on the use of force.
Official figures on the number of deaths with PDEA leading the drug war have yet to be released.
Gascon, however, noted the stark contrast during the time of the PNP when thousands died in police operations and in the hands of suspected vigilantes.
Gascon said CHR is ready to monitor the return of the PNP in the war against illegal drugs, saying they will call out irregularities.
“We assure the public that we in the CHR are ready to communicate with law enforcement agencies should they need to be reminded of their (human rights obligations) as mandated by the law,” he said.
Gascon said they are also ready to seek the assistance of the Office of the Ombudsman should the Department of Justice fail to hold to account those responsible for the killings. – Janvic Mateo
New U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Glyn Davies arrived in Bangkok this week after the senior post remained vacant for nearly a year amid troubled times for bilateral ties. The seasoned envoy, a 35-year veteran in America's diplomatic corps, will be tasked with steering relations in the wake of last year's military takeover and rising perceptions that China has stolen a march through overtures towards Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha's rights-curbing government.
Thai-U.S. ties are arguably at their lowest point in decades, crucially at a time when Washington is bidding to marshal regional support for its China-containing ‘pivot' policy. Outgoing U.S. ambassador Kristie Kenney staked out a hard line against the coup, a position the State Department has maintained on democratic principle to the detriment of the wider strategic relationship. Kenney's stance has so far outweighed the views of Thailand specialists in Washington who have called for a more nuanced approach to guard the United States' considerable economic and strategic interests in the country.
Critical remarks made by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel at a Bangkok university in January saw Thailand's Foreign Ministry reciprocally summon and upbraid charge d' affaires W. Patrick Murphy. The diplomatic dressing down, reported widely in local media, was viewed as unprecedented for the long-time strategic allies. Murphy, a Myanmar specialist who has ably acted as the United States' top envoy in Bangkok since Kenney's departure in October, has maintained Washington's drumbeat call for a speedy restoration of democracy and a reversal of curbs on rights and liberties.
Yet some Bangkok-based observers have sensed a softening of Kenney's line under Murphy's watch. While high-level strategic dialogue is still suspended, a September 1 meeting between U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) administer Charles Bolden and Science Minister Pichet Durongkaveroj aimed to resume bilateral cooperation. A NASA request in 2012 to conduct a regional climate study from Thailand's U-Tapao air base was cancelled during the Yingluck Shinawatra government amid partisan accusations of possible ulterior motives involving her self-exiled former premier brother, Thaksin Shinawatra.
Reports at the time also speculated that China had weighed against the project on concerns that U.S. satellites, beyond measuring weather patterns, could be trained to spy on Chinese territory from Thai airspace. U.S.-Thai intelligence sharing, ranked by a leaked National Security Agency document as among the U.S.'s top dozen or so partners in the world before the coup, has since been downgraded significantly, according to people familiar with the situation. That was apparent in Thailand's refusal to accept offered U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation assistance in investigating the still unexplained bombing attack that killed 20 people in Bangkok on August 17.
Davies, a former special representative for North Korea policy and to the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency, is widely respected in Washington for his diplomatic management of high-stakes political imbroglios. His appointment has signaled to some that the U.S. may give higher priority to the relationship, after dispatching a series of less distinguished and sometimes disinterested envoys. Many officials and analysts in Bangkok argue that former U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Ralph “Skip” Boyce, a fluent Thai speaker with top connections across the political spectrum, was the last top American diplomat to see clearly through the country's complex, personality-driven politics.
Government advisors have bid to manufacture a soft-landing for Davies. Prior to his arrival in Bangkok, Davies received personal calls from Privy Councilors, royal advisors to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, welcoming his appointment, according to a source familiar with the communications. (In one of his first moves as ambassador, Davies on Friday visited the Grand Palace to pay respects and wish good health to the king.) That royal treatment contrasts with Kenney's initial reception in 2010, where she was scolded by Privy Council President and long-time U.S. ally Prem Tinsulonanda for the leak of confidential U.S. cables, including one that detailed a meeting he and other royal advisors held with Boyce to discuss sensitivities around the royal succession. It's unclear if that meeting, which Kenney later described to confidantes as among the toughest of her career, colored her diplomacy in favor of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her family clan's affiliated ‘Red Shirt' pressure group.
If Davies aims to recalibrate relations towards more engagement to counter China's post-coup advances, he will be hard-pressed to justify the policy U-turn. A military-appointed council's rejection of a draft constitution on September 6 will further delay the junta's roadmap to new elections from 2016 to 2017, undermining Prayut's earlier pledge to quickly restore elected civilian rule. While vowing to institute “democratic” reforms, the military is simultaneously building a police state bent on ferreting out and squashing dissent. The recent three-day detention of journalist Pravit Rojanaphruk, where the outspoken scribe was blindfolded and held incommunicado by surgical mask-wearing plainclothes commandos, signaled a turn towards more hard-knuckled repression of critical voices.
Many fear that style of repression will intensify as the royal succession draws nearer amid mounting signs it may be contested by competing military, political and royalist camps. While the United States has publicly pushed for a rapid restoration of democracy, it has no doubt by now dawned on American policymakers that Prayut intends to stay in power until the succession is secure. While many in Bangkok call for stronger measures against Prayut's assault on rights, including a new whisper campaign led by pro-Yingluck soldiers calling for an arms embargo, Davies will simultaneously need to counter perceptions in Washington that his predecessor's style of diplomacy pushed Thailand towards China at a crucial strategic juncture. How Davies strikes that policy balance will go a long way in determining whether the United States is on the right or wrong side of Thailand's post-succession history.
Dash-cam footage shows gunman John Allen being pulled over for a routine stop in Oregon and firing shots at a state trooper for an unknown reason while his three children were in the car. Allen was shot and killed by the trooper. NBC's Miguel Almaguer reports.
Warning: Some viewers may find this video disturbing.
Dramatic dashboard-camera video captured a man in military fatigues opening fire on a police officer during a routine traffic stop on an Oregon highway while the man's three children waited in his car.
The man, identified by investigators as John Allen II, took a bullet to the chest from the officer and managed to drive a half-mile away before slumping in his car and dying. The officer was shot in the side but survived.
The stop happened outside Portland in August. The dash-cam video shows Allen getting out of the car and captures the officer, off camera, saying: “Please sit back in the car for me.”
Allen stands still, his right hand apparently on his back pocket. The officer yells: “Sir! Get back in the car for me now!” Allen then walks toward the officer, and — just as the officer yells, “Sir! Sir!” — opens fire.
Allen appears to empty his clip before taking off in the car. The officer is heard saying, “I'm OK.”
The children are 15, 13 and 10, and were not hurt.
“It's upsetting, yeah,” said Deborah Morton-Hamlet, Allen's aunt. “He was trying to take his children on a road trip.”

Top White House officials on Friday worked to reassure the American public that the national response to Ebola is under control.
Leaders of the country's health, defense and military branches stressed that they are taking the right steps to contain the spread of the deadly virus, which was first diagnosed in the U.S. on Tuesday.

“We know how to do this, and we will do it again,” Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, said at a press briefing.
“It's very important to remind the American people that U.S. has the most capable healthcare system and the most capable doctors in the world, bar none,” Monaco said.
The press conference appeared to be aimed at calming a public worried about a possible outbreak in the United States of the disease, which has killed more than 3,000 people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
The first case of Ebola in the United States was revealed this week. Fifty people who came in contact with Thomas Duncan, who traveled to the United States from Liberia, are under observation, including 10 who are considered at high risk of getting the disease.
Duncan's entry to the United States has led to calls to cut off travel to the country from the African nations where Ebola has spread. The White House has rejected those calls, calling them counter-productive.
Two hospitals — in D.C. and Maryland — reported Friday that they were monitoring patients with Ebola-like symptoms, adding to the sense of urgency. The case at D.C.'s Howard University hospital is still unconfirmed while a patient tested negative late Friday for Ebola at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville, Md.
With that backdrop, the officials at the White House made the case for why the U.S. is well equipped to handle Ebola.
Monaco said the U.S. healthcare system “could not be more opposite” than those in countries most affected by Ebola.
Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stressed the U.S. healthcare care is “very, very, very well-established.”
While he acknowledged that the disease has spurred “a lot of fear” across the country, he reiterated that an outbreak is extremely unlikely.
The officials outlined a long list of precautions taken to control the disease since it was first diagnosed in March. The first humanitarian workers were deployed to the region that same month and continued to escalate their presence throughout the summer.
The HHS sent its first Ebola-related guidance to hospitals on July 28, and has since provided six more. The department has also strengthened surveillance and lab testing, as well as advising staff on how to properly screen airline passengers in the U.S.
Monaco stressed that the air screenings have been almost entirely effective in preventing the spread of Ebola onto U.S. soil.
“Dozens and dozens of people have been stopped from getting onto planes,” she said. “We have now seen tens of thousands of people [arrive in the U.S.] since March to the current day, and we now have this one isolated case.”
The administration also addressed growing concerns over the competency of the Dallas health system that is currently overseeing treatment of the country's sole case of Ebola.
Health officials in Dallas revealed Friday there had been a 48-hour delay in identifying people who may have been in contact with the infected patient. The hospital already faced criticized for failing to initially diagnose Duncan's Ebola-like after he told at least one clinician he had recently traveled in Liberia.
Fauci acknowledged that Dallas health workers had made mistakes but said he remained confident that the federal government was managing the response.
“There are things that did not go the way they should have in Dallas,” he said. “Although there were missteps there, there were good things that happened also.”
The Environment Agency has urged communities in northern England to remain vigilant against the threat of flooding as more than 180mm of rain fell overnight in some places.
Although it lifted severe flood warnings – its highest level of alert - for Cumbria, the agency said persistent, localised heavy rainfall was expected throughout Sunday and into Monday with river levels extremely high and continuing to rise in places.
The risk was highest for Cumbria, parts of Lancashire and western parts of North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. The outlook for the rest of the week remains unsettled.

Police in several counties have warned of bad driving conditions, with some roads flooded. In Stockton-on-Tees, three people were taken to hospital for checks after a taxi overturned in what police described as “awful driving conditions”.
In Cumbria, despite the lifting of the severe flood warnings, police advised motorists to drive “only if absolutely necessary” after torrential rain left roads flooded and hundreds of people fearing their homes may be inundated.
Ch Insp Matt Kennerley said: “Many of the county's roads, including the A66 at Threlkeld, have minor road surface flooding. Our advice is to drive only if necessary today as it is expected, that with further deteriorating weather conditions, more roads will be affected with an increasing severity.”
He also warned of significant crosswinds in the Shap area, where the M6 crosses high ground in Cumbria. The EA initially issued 12 severe flood warnings for areas in and around the Cumbrian towns of Kendal and Egremont.
“Heavy rain is falling on already saturated ground causing rivers to rise and bringing a risk of flooding across the north-west,” said Craig Woolhouse, EA director of incident management. “We urge people to check the risk of flooding in their area, sign up for flood warnings and be prepared to take immediate action.”
Further heavy rainfall is expected next week, the agency added. It said its teams were preparing temporary barriers, deploying sandbags along riverbanks, clearing river blockages and monitoring water levels.
The EA last week said it had sent two water pumps to Cumbria capable of pumping 120,000 cubic litres of floodwater a minute.
“Communities in northern England should remain vigilant to the risk of flooding,” said Neil Davies, EA flood risk duty manager. “Further heavy, persistent rain is expected throughout Sunday and into Monday, and river levels remain extremely high and are continuing to rise in places. Fifteen thousand properties have been protected from flooding thanks to Environment Agency flood schemes”
Birds fly past an Orthodox church during a partial solar eclipse in the town of Volozhin, Belarus. (Reuters)
In 1994, Doug Duncan was standing on the Bolivian Altiplano with of group of fellow astronomers. The scientists had come to witness a total solar eclipse, and as such, most of their gazes were turned skyward as the totality approached. That is, until a woman starting shouting, “Look down! Look down!”
“I can still hear her voice,” said Duncan, the director of the Fiske Planetarium at the University of Colorado. “So, we look down and … llamas. Llamas all over the place.”
They were surrounded by llamas — but not for long. After a few minutes, the moon's 70-mile-wide shadow passed on and light returned to the plateau, at which point the llamas formed a sort of procession and marched away. Duncan, who has witnessed 10 total solar eclipses, said he still has no idea where the animals came from or what their behavior meant, if anything. But even as a scientist who knows more about space than camelids, he thought the way the llamas' behaved was certainly weird.
Another time, in the Galápagos Islands, Duncan watched as a bunch of whales and dolphins surfaced and started cruising back and forth in front of the ship he was on about five minutes before a total eclipse. A few minutes after the sun had come back out and it was clear the world was not ending, the marine mammals disappeared, just as the Bolivian llamas had.
There are lots of these kinds of stories — anecdotal reports of animals behaving strangely in the moments leading up to and after a solar eclipse. Some say that when the moon scoots in front of the sun and the world goes dark, as it will across the United States on Aug. 21, birds stop singing and cows and horses start returning to their barns as though it were time for bed.
These are pretty common and consistent observations, said Angela Speck, director of astronomy at the University of Missouri. “And it doesn't seem to matter whether it's happening in a rural area or a city,” she said.
But when you start looking for rigorous research on animal behavior during eclipses, the pickings are slim. One study found that colonial orb-weaving spiders appeared to start deconstructing their webs during an eclipse in Mexico in 1991. Another study, from 1984, noted that a group of captive chimpanzees in Georgia all seemed to congregate on a climbing structure during the totality. But a study of rumination and grazing behavior in cattle during Europe's 1999 eclipse found no effect. Similarly, a group of captive baboons in Chile seemed decidedly meh about the eclipse in 1994.
The thing is, the world only gets a total solar eclipse approximately every 18 months, and the path of totality varies depending on where and when the moon crosses the sun's rays. This makes studying animal behavior during an eclipse rather difficult. The best experiments require scientists to control for variables and repeat the test many times to evaluate its validity. So even if we get some really good observations this time around of, say, moose, the next total solar eclipse won't be until July 2019, and its path of totality drifts over Chile and Argentina, neither of which is home to moose.
The path of this year's total solar eclipse, which will occur on Aug. 21.
All of that said, scientists are well accustomed to making the best out of imperfect study conditions. And this year, technological advances may help us gather data about eclipse-experiencing critters like never before. In fact, scientists are hoping you might donate a little data to the cause.
All you have to do, they say, is whip out your smartphone and download the iNaturalist app. Created by the California Academy of Sciences, iNaturalist allows anyone to take a picture of an animal (or plant or fungi or whatever) and make an attempt to identify it. Then others, including experts, weigh in on whether your ID is correct or not. Think of it as a bit like Pokémon Go, only you're trying to “catch” real creatures instead of Charizards and Vaporeons.
On the day of the eclipse, the app will feature a special drawdown menu that allows you to record observations leading up to, during, and after the astronomical event. Simply keep an eye out for any interesting or unusual behavior and snap a few pics while you enjoy the show.
“We're hoping this is a way for people to be curious and make observations and think about how animal behavior is related to the sun,” said Rebecca Johnson, citizen scientist research coordinator for the California Academy of Sciences.

What's more, Johnson said, all of the thousands of notes resulting from this project, which they are calling Life Responds, could allow researchers to establish a baseline of behavior that they can measure future eclipses against. It's only through this massive aggregation of data — which has never before been possible — that they can start to recognize patterns and draw conclusions.
“The whole idea of science, of course, is to turn something from anecdote into real data that you can study,” said Michelle Thaller, deputy director of science for communications at NASA, which is including the Life Responds project as part of its citizen science outreach in conjunction with the eclipse.
If you're looking for places to find animals during the eclipse, here's a list of more than a dozen wildlife refuges within the path of totality. If getting outdoors isn't really your thing, you can participate by going to places like the Nashville Zoo, which is encouraging visitors to log observations by using the iNaturalist app or tagging the zoo on social media with the hashtags #NashvilleZoo or #NZooEclipse. While the zoo is home to plenty of big animals like primates and giraffes, it's the birds that might be the most interesting.
“I don't think anybody knows for sure what the animals will do,” said Jim Bartoo, the zoo's marketing and public relations director, “but my bet would be to watch the flamingoes and the rhinoceros hornbills.”

Bartoo said the zoo's avian staff thinks the birds may be more affected than other animals because they're used to being brought inside as the sun sets. And while zoo animals obviously aren't perfect substitutes for understanding the behavior of their wild counterparts, the eclipse offers an opportunity to study animals that have become used to the rhythms of captivity. The zoo's rhinoceroses, for instance, come outside each day at 9 a.m. and return to their paddock each night at 6 p.m. Who knows how they'll react to a few minutes of unscheduled darkness?
Of course, it's entirely possible that the squirrel, blue jay, rattlesnake or rhino you're watching doesn't do a darn thing when the big moment comes. Don't worry, but do take notes. After all, logging the absence of weird behavior is important to science, too. (Good news: You don't even have to be in the line of totality to log animal behavior observations.)
One thing all the experts agree on is that if you're going to attempt to watch the solar eclipse this month, be sure to wear proper eye protection. But don't worry about getting a pair of glasses for Fido.
“Animals are actually quite a bit smarter than we are when it comes to looking directly at the sun,” says Thaller.

Just when you thought you wouldn't get ANY other sneak peek at the new Twin Peaks before its debut on May 21st, Showtime revealed six exclusive behind the scenes photos via Entertainment Weekly. What's interesting (and possibly irrelevant) is that the metadata of these pictures mention “Season 1” of Twin Peaks 2017.

With some top-yielding no-tillers — including soybean yield record holder Kip Cullers — applying sugar to their crops, researchers and growers have been working to determine the value of this practice.
From 2010-14, a group of growers with the Nebraska On-Farm Research Network applied sugar to their corn, sorghum and soybean crops to determine if there was any effect on yield. They followed Cullers' program by applying a mixture of 3 pounds sugar (beet or cane sugar from the local grocery store) and 10 gallons of water per acre around the V7 stage in corn and sorghum and R3 stage in soybeans.
Their research found that overall, there were no statistical yield differences between the sugar applications and untreated checks for corn and sorghum. For soybeans, there were statistical yield increases from the sugar applications in 2013 and 2014 — 1- and 2-bushel increases, respectively.
While sugar may not have influenced corn yield, growers did find the treatment improved stalk strength by using the pinch test, where 20 corn stalks are pinched by the thumb and first finger at the first internode above the soil, a few weeks before harvest.
Perhaps the biggest benefit sugar offers is to the community of beneficial insects. Utah State University researchers examined the effects of what they called “artificial honeydew,” a sugar-water solution, in alfalfa. They found adult lacewings and lady beetles always responded positively to the solution, as well as other beneficial insects, including adult weevil parasitoid, big-eyed bugs, minute pirate bugs and adult hover flies.
University of Nebraska Extension says in Honduras, researchers found similar results in corn. Counts of beneficial insects taken immediately after an application of a sugar-water mix were 70% higher than untreated corn, and twice as high a week after application. Fall armyworm infestations were also reduced by 18% in the sugar-treated corn.
USDA Agricultural Research Service entomologists have also seen that female lady beetles that have sugar in their diets have an increased survival rate and egg production over the beetles that were not fed sugar, suggesting sugar feeding is important for lady beetle populations. Another study saw lady beetles stayed 20-30% longer in plots where sugar-water was applied.
Is sugar a tool you've implemented in your no-till operation? What's your application process and what benefits have you seen? Leave a comment a below and share your experiences.
On April 20, as lethal amounts of oil and gas crept into the drill pipe of BP's Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, the attention of the energy and environmental world was elsewhere.
The Jefferies investment firm issued a report that recommended buying shares of Halliburton, whose cement job was buckling under the sea floor. Environmental groups were getting ready to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Earth Day. The Obama administration and its Senate allies were planning to unveil a climate proposal alongside corporate leaders, including a top executive from BP.
Then came the Big Spill.
For four months, the geology of the public agenda shifted. The climate proposal was never rolled out. Earth Day's anniversary was the day oil from the Macondo well started gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. President Obama's March push to open areas to offshore drilling gave way to a six-month moratorium on new deep-water exploration wells.
Now that the well is officially dead, what is its legacy? Will the massive spill -- the biggest offshore spill in U.S. history -- make a drop of difference in the long run? Will it change long-term trends in offshore oil drilling, U.S. energy policy or the way consumers use energy?
"For the companies, the regulators and the gulf residents, the spill has had a profound impact on their operations and ways of life. For the broader national population and the political debate, it has had a surprisingly small impact," said Jason Grumet, executive director of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a part of the nonprofit Bipartisan Policy Center. "It is the modesty of the impact on the national energy debate that is in many ways most surprising."
For a time, it seemed that the spill might galvanize lawmakers and consumers. But consumers respond to gasoline prices, which have been unusually stable for the past few months. In the Senate, ironically, a climate compromise unraveled, in part because expanded offshore drilling could no longer be used to woo undecided members. The Senate probably won't even pass a narrow oil spill measure, which has been bogged down in disputes over such issues as liability limits for offshore drilling.
Moreover, Obama is expected to lift his drilling moratorium soon, yielding both to pressure from Gulf Coast lawmakers worried about jobs and to the reality that offshore drilling is needed to meet U.S. oil demands. Chernobyl helped end nuclear plant construction in Europe, but deep-water offshore drilling will continue because that's where the oil is. Now, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declares that much of the spill has been devoured by microbes and dissipated, the political impact of the spill could dissipate further.
"As soon as the well was contained, we bounced back to American exceptionalism," said Grumet. It was as though, he said, the nation cried, "We did it!"
"Is it the Twitter consciousness where every 15 seconds we have a new thought?" Grumet wonders. "Is it that the recession has made so many people worried about themselves? Or is it that the impacts were so localized that once the newspapers stopped talking about it, it went away?"
But many experts said that, within the industry, the spill has had lasting consequences, apart from any direct environmental damage.
"I think the spill is a game changer," said William Reilly, co-chairman of the president's oil spill commission tasked with examining policy for offshore drilling in light of what went wrong with the Macondo well. "The industry has never been more alert to safety."
Netflix reported 29.17 million domestic subscribers in the first quarter of 2013, surpassing HBO for the first time.
Netflix, which ended 2012 with 27.15 million domestic subs, added just over 2 million subs, according to first quarter results issued Monday.
HBO ended 2012 with 28.7 million subscribers, according to data from SNL Kagan.
The new figures will likely escalate the rivalry simmering between the two companies, given the barbs Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Jeff Bewkes, chairman of HBO parent company Time Warner, have traded over the years
That said, Netflix has a ways to go before catching up worldwide. HBO has 114 million subscribers across the globe, a far cry from the 7.14 million Netflix has outside the U.S. Netflix also added just over 1 million subs internationally in US., bringing its global total to over 36 million subs–more than 3 million than last quarter.
SNL Kagan will offer first-quarter update next month on the premium channels, which could put HBO back on top again.

Steinmeier pointed to the deployment of NATO troops near borders with Russia in the military alliance's Baltic and east European member states.
"What we should avoid today is inflaming the situation by warmongering and stomping boots," Steinmeier told Bild in an interview to be published Sunday.
"Anyone who thinks you can increase security in the alliance with symbolic parades of tanks near the eastern borders, is mistaken," Germany's top diplomat added.
NATO had announced on Monday that it would deploy four battalions to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to counter a more assertive Russia, ahead of a landmark summit in Warsaw next month.
All four countries were once ruled from Moscow and remain deeply suspicious of Russian intentions, especially after Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.
In an interview with Bild on Thursday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Russia is seeking to create "a zone of influence through military means".
"We are observing massive militarisation at NATO borders -- in the Arctic, in the Baltic, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea," he told the newspaper.
Stoltenberg has stressed that NATO does not seek confrontation with Russia and wants a constructive dialogue but that it would defend the 28 allies against any threat
Russia bitterly opposes NATO's expansion into its Soviet-era satellites and last month said it would create three new divisions in its southwest region to meet what it described as a dangerous military build-up along its borders.
Featured Etsy Shop: Lucky Ink
Our featured artist today is Holly over at Lucky Ink. You'll find gorgeous stationary, prints, notebooks and more in her Etsy shop, and tons of inspiration over at her blog! I adore the clean lines and simple beauty of Holly's items, and I know you will too! I also know you'll totally flip for the amazing giveaway she has in store for us below… 😉
Tell us a little about yourself…
Hello, I'm Holly! I'm currently living in Portugal, but I was born and raised in California. I absolutely love graphic design, DIY, knitting, baking, and travelling.
What do you love about your craft?
Being able to make something that will hold a lot of meaning for someone, whether it's a personalized Birthday card or stationery, or a wedding suite. I love the idea of that my work is part of a special moment!
What item was your favorite to make so far?
Design wise, I'd definitely say my floral collage deer art print. I sketched the idea with no detail, not sure how I would actually pull it off. It turned out even better than I could have imagined and I'm really proud of it!
Craft wise, I am really proud of my notebooks. This was another idea I wasn't sure I could make, and I didn't think I had the skills to do it right. Once I got everything I needed, and after much trial and error, I was so happy with how it came out.
Where do you find your creative inspiration?
From anything, really! I'm very much inspired by patterns and shapes, but sometimes it's as simple as a color palette that inspires me. Traditional prints, vintage/retro patterns, sometimes even fabric or jewelry, really anything that has nice lines and bold shapes.
How did you decide to open your Etsy shop?
I have had an Etsy shop together with my mom since 2006 (sewing bags), but I always knew I wanted a store of my own one day. I think the hardest thing was deciding what I was going to make to sell, because I love making so many different things. Once I realized my biggest passion was graphic design, stationery was an easy choice!
Any advice for others who want to start their own Etsy shop, or who are looking to fulfill their passion for crafting?
Don't doubt yourself! The reason it took me so long to open my store is because I was constantly second guessing myself. Etsy is full of amazing, talented people, which can be intimidating, but the reality is: everyone brings their own talents, aesthetic, style and skills to their store, so your store will never be like anyone else's. As long as you're willing to put in the hard work (customer service, promoting, SEO, networking, making new stock etc.) and are truly passionate about what you do (so it doesn't feel like hard work!) you will be successful!
Please check out Holly on her blog, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts, too!
Holly is giving one lucky Katie Crafts reader a really great gift: $30 store credit OR 3 art prints! We want everyone to have a chance to enter this special raffle, so we're extending it right off the bat- you until April 28th at 11:59PM to enter to win this wonderful prize!

I will always remember the magical moment when I saw and heard a brand-new English word being created. It happened on a commuter train from Oxford to Paddington, during the evening rush, and I witnessed the word being conjured, in an instant, right out of thin air.
Earlier that day I had been in Broadmoor Asylum, researching the strange and tortured Victorian life of an American doctor who had murdered a Londoner in a fit of schizophrenic fury.
The doctor was a clever man, with a vast library in his cell, and in an effort to rehabilitate himself he had volunteered, anonymously, to help make contributions to the Oxford English Dictionary, then under construction in a tin shed in the back garden of James Murray's house on Banbury Road.
But his madness, which ebbed and flowed during his 40-year incarceration, became exceptionally florid one day in 1902, and in a sudden spasm of self-loathing he sliced off his penis with a knife, and flung it into the prison fire.
My discovery of this remarkable event answered a small but singular question: just why the man's work for the OED had suddenly faded away. Delighted with the find, I went promptly up to the OED offices in Oxford to tell everyone and then I walked over to Oxford station.
At the ticket window were two elderly women lexicographers, off to London for the theatre. As we boarded the train, I warned them: have I ever got a story to tell you.
And so, in every gruesome detail, and in an open-plan Thameslink carriage, I related the saga: the sharpening of the blade, the tying of the ligature, the gritted teeth, the fatal slice – and, as I said this, so every whey-faced businessman in the carriage crossed his legs reflexively. There was a sudden corporate gasp.
But not from the two old ladies. They remained quite impassive, thinking. I could see the lexicographical gears grinding in their minds. Then suddenly, and in unison I swear, they spoke: "Autopeotomy!" they cried. Then one to the other: "Yes, Mildred – peotomy is the amputation of the penis. But doing it yourself – that must be autopeotomy. A neologism, I am sure. And Mr Winchester, if you can include this new word in an illustrative sentence in the book you are writing, then we will include it in the next edition of the OED, and you'll be a small part of history."
And so I did, and it duly was and I duly am, and there autopeotomy lies for ever, part of the glittering marvels that make up the English language and which, on Wednesday, is set to celebrate the creation of its one millionth word, according to the Global Language Monitor, a Texas-based association of academics that tracks the use of new words.
It is not known which the millionth word will be, but those on the brink of entering the language as finalists for the one millionth English-language word include "zombie banks", or those banks that would be defunct without government intervention; the pejorative "noob", referring to a newcomer to a given task or community, as in "She's a complete noob to guerrilla gardening"; and "quendy-trendy", meaning hip or up-to-date.
I relish them all and, quite frankly, blame my father, plus whoever it was in New York who invented the crossword in the 1920s, for my passion. For my father was a fanatic, and he urged me as a callow teenager to compete with him to see who could do this paper's crossword the faster, a cornflakes box as a barrier between us. We did The Times and The Telegraph, but for difficult words preferred Ximenes in The Observer, and I came to love Chambers 20th Century dictionary, with all its obscure Scots words that the crossword-setter demanded.
And then, of course, it was but a slow progression from buying Chambers, to owning the OED. I bought my first 17-volume set back in the Eighties, in Hong Kong. I will long remember carrying the books downstairs from a shop in On Lan Street, and stuffing them into the boot of my car during a furious typhoon, sheeting rain and lightning.
I've never been without an OED since. I have three complete sets, including one, bound in dark blue leather and titled in gold, that OUP gave me for writing about the history of what someone called "the greatest piece of sensational serial literature ever written".
I open it up every day. Each morning I take a randomly selected volume to what the Arabs call "the cave of making" and ponder it for more blissful minutes than I imagine most proctologists would think prudent. But the things I discover, the ammunition I have for the hours of writing ahead!
For there seems to be a word for every concept, imaginable and many unimaginable. My favourite for years was "mallemaroking", which an early edition defined as "the carousing of drunken seamen aboard ice-bound Greenland whaling ships", which struck me as a masterly example of hairline linguistic precision. But a later edition of the dictionary slightly amended the definition, dropping the location, trimming it to "the carousing of drunken seamen aboard icebound whaling ships".
This prompted a friend to write a tongue-in-cheek polemic: the foul practice of mallemaroking, he declared, appears to have become unleashed from its native Greenland, and now threatens to extend its tentacles across the entire world. Before it is too late, it must be stopped!
I just cannot imagine any other language offering such opportunities for gaiety and fun. Reading recently that both the Germans and the Chinese have cracked down on the names people are allowed to have, and knowing that the French and the Italians still have gloom-laden academies to protect the
so-called purity of their languages, strips out all the amusement and joy that is so very apparent in the tongue we speak so happily. I feel for them, poor deprived purists.
But our language is not perfect. Perhaps not all circumstances are covered, and once I tried to invent a word to fill one tiny niche I felt I discerned in the lexicon. There seemed no word for the grey water-trail left on the kitchen floor by children who come in from the snow without taking off their wellingtons. So I came up with "drimmens", which seemed appropriately glum and grim and vaguely Scots, and I used it in articles for a while. But no one took it up, and, unlike the grislier example of self-mutilation, it never made it to the OED, nor to the Texan million list. I sulk still.
The language bobs and weaves. Words are fugitive things, altering their meaning as custom demands. "Sophisticated" once represented a bad thing, similar to adulteration (similar – but not the same: another delight of English is that there are also no synonyms, most words being highly specific to their task). "Sub-prime", the current bogeyman of the financial crisis, was by contrast once a good thing: once everyone wanted a sub-prime mortgage, which indicated a low interest rate. And these changes give me great pleasure, too, a reminder of how alive and ever-growing our language still manages to be. It changes as the world changes.
I have no doubt which book I would choose, were I ever to be marooned on a desert island: the biggest English dictionary imaginable. They say the next edition of the OED, accommodating all one million of our words, will amount to 40 volumes – enough to be used perhaps to construct the platform of a raft.
Yet I would never dream of doing such a thing, however tempting. I would keep it intact and dry, I would stay put on the island and read the good book every day – while endlessly sailing away with it, entirely in my mind.
Finalists for the one millionth English word

New Orleans, Louisiana- As New Orleans prepares to be hit by another potentially devastating hurricane, New Orleans officials hit the airwaves proving how they will not screw this one up.
New Orleans Mayor, Mitch Landrieu stated in a press conference earlier today “We've totally got this one.”
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have been hard at work making sure the impact of Hurricane Isaac will “be way, way less than Hurricane Katrina.”
Lt. James Brixton goes on to say “we are so prepared this time around, it's not even funny. We conscripted many local beavers to help us reinforce our previously damaged and ill designed levy system. No one knows more about containing the unpredictable power of water than the wise beaver.”
Preparations have not been limited to dam preparations. Before Hurricane Isaac was scheduled to hit land, New Orleans officials had been seen handing out pool noodles in low-income households of the city. Landrieu was quoted as saying, “every man woman and child should have adequate access to life saving technology, no matter where they live.”
FEMA Director, W. Craig Fugate, doesn't expect quite as much destruction with Isaac as there was with Katrina. He reports that “I know we kinda dropped the ball on this Hurricane business last time, but this one's going to be a breeze. Wait, poor choice of words. It's going to be a cake walk. Let them eat cake.”
FEMA's Waffle House test seems to reverberate Fugate's eased attitude toward the Hurricane. The Waffle House test prioritizes the effect of damage from a natural disaster by the service available at Waffle Houses in the region. The test ranges from full service & fully operational, full service with a secondary power generator, limited menu with generator, to non-operational. Fugate tried relieving perceived tensions by explaining, “So what if you can't get your hash browns all the way? You can still get them smothered and covered, which is all you really need.”
The Republican National Convention plans to hold a group show prayer, where they plan to pray for the protection and safety to all those living in the projected hurricane path, while simultaneously secretly thanking their deity for allowing them to continue their convention.
At his last press conference, in a field where Landrieu was building a boat capable of holding enough campaign contributors to ensure his re-election, he assured every one that “there is no need to worry. This is what New Orleans does best. We proved before that a Hurricane can't topple what so many have spent so long to build. With the help of God, nature, and ingenuity, the people of New Orleans will prevail.”
Since the day we first opened our doors in 1993, Rudy's has been a safe haven for everybody. We're more than just a barbershop, we're a community center for our friends and neighbors: creatives, punks, weirdos, cool kids, and everyone in between. Our shops are a place where people can come together without judgment or pretense.
Throughout the years, we've made it our mission to fight for inclusivity and acceptance for the LGBTQ community, a group that has been the backbone of Rudy's from the start. Since 2012, It Gets Better Project has been invaluable in helping us fulfill that mission.
As Rudy's evolves, so does our partnership with It Gets Better Project.
With the launch of our all new 1—2—3 line of hair and body products, we are furthering our commitment to the LGBTQ community and its most vulnerable members—homeless youth.
For every purchase of any 1—2—3 product, Rudy's will donate a week's worth of the same product to a shelter that serves LGBTQ youth so that everybody can feel their best.
“Homelessness disproportionately affects the LGBTQ community – with almost 40% of homeless youth identifying as LGBTQ. When considering the complexity of the issue, it is easy to lose sight of the small day-to-day essentials that can have a big impact on someone's life – like access to personal care products,” says Brian Wenke, Executive Director of It Gets Better Project. “Rudy's has, once again, found a meaningful way to support the LGBTQ community by providing its 1-2-3 shower products to homeless shelters across the country. And, It Gets Better Project is proud to support the effort of one of its most committed partners.”
So here's your chance, get clean for a good cause.

Portugal has declared three days of mourning for the 62 victims of one of the country's deadliest forest fires.
Four children are among the victims, many of whom were found dead inside their cars as they tried to flee the central forested region of Pedrógão Grande.
Hundreds of firefighters are continuing to tackle the blaze on several fronts.
Prime Minister Antonio Costa called it "the greatest tragedy we have seen in recent years in terms of forest fires".
He said it was thought to have been sparked by a lightning strike.

There are fears the death toll could rise, as a number of people are still missing. The period of national mourning ends on Tuesday.
Bodies found inside cars
Emergency service workers were battling 156 fires across the country on Sunday, Prime Minister Costa said, adding that most of the victims had died in just one of them.
Secretary of State for the Interior Jorge Gomes said that most had died from smoke inhalation and burns, while two were killed in a road accident related to the fires.
Thirty bodies were found inside cars, with another 17 next to the vehicles, on one road leading on to the IC8 motorway.
Another 11 died in a village next to the motorway.

More than 1,600 firefighters are fighting five of the main fires, supported by about 400 vehicles and 18 aircraft, Portugal's Público reports.
According to the prime minister, just 11 fires are still active but he said the authorities were "particularly worried about two of them".
They have sent two army battalions to help the emergency services.
'I could have died, I should have died' - fire survivor's tale
As the power went off, the flames hit hard, a fiery red tornado passed the windows. We crouched on the floor for a good hour, trying to breathe, praying, crying.
I am not ashamed to say it: I was praying, we were all praying. I am not religious, but at that time, you couldn't do anything else.
I said: "It can't end like this." I just started crying and got emotional - I was no use to anyone for 20 minutes.
Eventually the fire passed and we emerged to see the smouldering remains of the village. Miraculously, our house and the one next door did not burn.
The devastation was indescribable. People, bewildered, remains of homes burning uncontrollably, concrete posts exploding over roads.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing. After the fire passed, it should still have been bright, but it was dark. There was a strange film over everyone's eyes.
You could hear gas canisters exploding, see blue flashes going off. There was just a strange silence. There was a lull, a strange feeling. It then turned to relief, there was crying.

France has offered three firefighting planes, while Spain has already sent two water-bombing aircraft to help tackle the fires. The European Union has also promised to provide firefighting aircraft.
Dozens of people who fled their homes have been taken in by residents of the nearby municipality of Ansiao.
Pope Francis, who visited Portugal last month, mentioned the victims in his weekly address: "I express my closeness to the beloved people of Portugal following the devastating fire."
French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: "Solidarity with Portugal, hit by terrible fires. Our thoughts are with victims. France makes its aid available to Portugal."

The fires began on Saturday during an intense heatwave and rainless thunderstorms, with temperatures of more than 40C (104F) in some areas. Police say lightning striking a tree may have caused the fire.
"This is a region that has had fires because of its forests, but we cannot remember a tragedy of these proportions," Valdemar Alves, the mayor of Pedrógão Grande, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press agency.
"I am completely stunned by the number of deaths."

Some may think the seminal moment in "Clueless" was when Cher Horowitz had a computer help her pick her outfit, but it was another exchange that perfectly captured the reality of being a contemporary woman. It was when Cher casually said this to her friend Dionne:
Sound familiar? We've all engaged in it, the seemingly harmless banter about our calorie intake or how we really need to hit the gym. But many of us don't realize just how harmful this pervasive "fat talk" can be. It's seeped its way into not only our daily conversations, but also our television shows, movies, magazines and billboards. It's inescapable.
"It's about the body, but it also seems to be about discipline and restraint," Alexandra F. Corning, a research associate professor in psychology at the University of Notre Dame, told The Huffington Post. "Essentially, it's self-degrading talk about the body, food or eating."
To be clear: Obesity is a problem in America, and there are serious health risks associated with it. But "fat talk" is something that women of every size and every body type engage in. It has little to do with one's actual weight, and everything to do with how we see ourselves.
There's a lot more to "fat" than, well, fat.
Perhaps one reason "fat talk" is so ubiquitous is because "fat" has become such a loaded term. According to the National Eating Disorders Association, 81 percent of 10-year-olds are afraid of being fat, and 42 percent of first- to third-graders say they want to be thinner.
"The word 'fat' has taken on a lot," said Corning, who's conducted multiple studies on "fat talk" among both children and adult women. "'Fat' is a way to really put someone down."
Self-proclaimed fat activist Lindsey Averill, one of the brains behind the documentary "Fattitude," says that the term "fat talk" is problematic in and of itself. She cited Kellogg's recent "Fight Fat Talk" campaign as one of the many misguided attempts to address the issue.
"Intrinsic in that idea is that 'fat' is bad," Averill told The Huffington Post. "The reality of it is that every single body has fat on it, and if it doesn't have fat on it, it's broken."
"The reality of it is that every single body has fat on it, and if it doesn't have fat on it, it's broken."
Averill also pointed out that pop culture has taught us to equate "fat" with "bad." Characters like Ursula the Sea Witch, the Queen of Hearts and Fat Bastard are just a few examples of large-bodied people portrayed as either jokes or villains onscreen. Just think about the all-too-casual "fat jokes" that appear on beloved shows like "The Big Bang Theory" and "How I Met Your Mother."
"They are both hilariously funny but unbelievably fat-phobic shows," Averill said. "With Barney Stinson, it's like every third word is a fat joke." (In fact, there are entire blogs devoted to this topic.)
"We're so afraid that our bodies might be perceived as fat," Averill said. "Fat is literally one of the worst things you can be in our culture, and it comes with so many different prejudices and negative effects, that when we look in the mirror, we're so afraid of crossing over into that category and we internalize that fear into hate."

Women are taught to be unhappy with their bodies, whether or not they're "fat."
In contemporary America, women are raised to feel dissatisfied with their bodies, a phenomenon that's called "normative discontent" in research, Corning said. Rather than feel love or even apathy about the way we're built, we tend to focus on our perceived flaws.
"Women are not brought up to believe, 'Hey, I look all right -- I've got some pretty good stuff here' or 'My body's a non-issue, so I'm going to study my math,'" Corning said.
Anecdotally, Corning blames the way women are bombarded with advertising, from billboards to the little boxes that appear on Facebook -- all of which portray a singular, skinny body type, what researchers refer to as the "thin ideal." She says that it's the job of advertisers to create discontent and distress about who we are and convince consumers that said discontent can be fixed through their products. Now, with the ability to digitally alter images, some of the female figures we see on a regular basis aren't even human. Think tiny waists, large breasts, no pores and not an ounce of cellulite.
Inevitably, many women start comparing themselves with the "thin ideal" and develop a negative relationship with their bodies. This is what leads to "fat talk" -- which, in turn, only makes matters worse. Researchers at Northwestern University have found that people who engage in "fat talk" report higher levels of body dissatisfaction and guilt, and people with higher levels of body dissatisfaction are more likely to engage in "fat talk" in the first place.
And that self-loathing is reinforced in our favorite movies and television shows.
From "Clueless" to "Sex and the City" to "Mean Girls," "fat talk" is something we also see modeled on television and in movies. It's easy to fall into this spiral: If Alicia Silverstone feels badly about her body, I must be enormous. This line of thinking has been borne out in studies as well as in the personal lives of many women. When Averill was a child, she said, she would watch her mother and grandmother try on clothes in store dressing rooms. It laid the groundwork for a number of negative habits.
"I would sit on the floor and I would listen to them talk about how they can't wear these white jeans because their thighs are too fat," she said. "So if their thighs are too fat, mine are humongous. I don't really think it was intentional, but that's the way it was."
Averill's mother and grandmother each weighed about 120 pounds, she said.
The media is also a major contributor to the national preoccupation with weight and appearance. Take one look at the tabloids at your local newsstand and you'll see an overwhelming amount of headlines about women's bodies, like "How I Got Thin" and "65-Pound Weight Gain!" Following this year's White House Correspondents' Dinner, Averill noticed that news anchors spent a generous amount of time commenting on the women's clothing while completely ignoring what male attendees wore.
"This is why we're talking about women's bodies in particular all of the time and why women are often talking about their bodies," Averill said. "The news is telling them that that is what's valuable about them -- how attractive they look."

But we also "fat talk" to fit in.
The main reason we're probably engaging in so much "fat talk"? Everyone else is doing it. When a friend laments eating too much cake at a holiday party, you risk looking unsympathetic, or even arrogant, if you don't join in with your own pledge to start running after your next slice.
"It's a way to keep us feeling like no one is better, no one is above the mean and we're all the same," Corning said.
Studies have shown that hearing "fat talk" makes you more likely to start complaining about your own body or calorie load. Unsurprisingly, during a recent controlled experiment, Corning and her co-author, Michaela Bucchianeri, discovered that women were more likely to believe the "fat talk" statements of other women than their self-affirming body statements. If women are defaulted to "negative" when it comes to looking at their figures, it's no wonder discontent is the norm.
"There's social pressure to be the kind of woman who conforms to the moral framework that says if I eat whatever I want, I'm a bad girl."
Another motive for women to "fat talk" is reassurance. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Northwestern University found that the most common response to "fat talk" was to deny that the complaining friend was fat, instead asserting that you yourself are the fat one. The vicious back-and-forth cycle of "No, you look great -- just look at my huge thighs!" (as so perfectly played out in that "my nail beds suck" scene in "Mean Girls") has become an integral part of the way women socialize. It's what you see your mother doing from a very young age, and it's what you do with your peers as soon as you become conscious of your body. It's how you fit in and interact with other women.
"'Fat talk' is women affirming with each other that it's OK to hate your body," Corning said. "There's social pressure to be the kind of woman who conforms to the moral framework that says if I eat whatever I want, I'm a bad girl."
So how can you avoid "fat talk"?
There's good news: We can control it. Or at least, we can take steps to control our own "fat talk" and how the "fat talk" of others affects us.
Both Averill and Corning recommend attacking the issue head-on if you're talking to someone with whom you're comfortable. If your friend starts in on "fat talk," Corning suggests saying something like: "Are you listening to the way you're demeaning yourself? You're so much more valuable than that," or "You and I are not doing 'fat talk' -- we are way above it."
Changing your perspective on "fat" is key, though, and a recent study suggests that your "visual diet" can make all the difference. The 2012 findings showed that women's preference for thinness decreased when they were exposed to images of larger bodies more frequently. Basically, if we see bodies of all shapes and sizes in our media, everyone is happier.
Of course, when it comes to "fat talk," much of the noise is coming from inside our own heads. For that, Corning had simple advice to offer.
"If you want to work out, go work out. You don't need to tell everyone what an awful person you are," she said. "If you don't want to eat a piece of pizza, don't eat it. Or if you find yourself eating it, just eat it. Enjoy it."
DEMERVAL LOBAO - Luiza Sousa, a 51-year-old unemployed woman from northeastern Brazil, knows exactly what a dollar is worth. “With two reais ($1), you can't even buy half a kilogram of chicken," said the resident of Demerval Lobão, in Piauí, one of Brazil's poorest states. "I bought a coconut with two reais today.”
But according to the Brazilian government, Sousa and her four sons were no longer living in extreme poverty by the end of 2012, when they started to receive two reais per month from the “Brasil Carinhoso” welfare program (“Caring Brazil”).
Under this program, families that are already receiving financial aid from another social welfare program, “Bolsa Familia” (“Family Allowance”), are eligible for an extra two-reais supplement. The government considers “extreme poverty” as a monthly income of up to 70 reais ($35) per person within a family.
Luiza receives 140 reais ($70) every month thanks to the Bolsa Familia program. At the end of 2012, an extra two reais were added to her allowance. Her other incomes come from donations and her part-time job as a washerwoman, and her oldest son's job as a housekeeper.
With the two extra reais, Luiza and her sons have joined the ranks of 16,4 million of people who have officially left extreme poverty in the past seven months. Luiza's neighbors, Joelina Maria de Sousa, 31, and her daughter, Jucélia, seven, were also eligible for the two reais allowance.
When is a person no longer poor?
According to data obtained by Folha, from last year, Luiza, Joelina and another 13,100 Brazilian families got the extra two reais, helping president Dilma Roussef to reach her election promise of eradicating extreme poverty in Brazil before 2014. This is idea behind Brasil Carinhoso, launched in the middle of last year.
The amount paid per family by the Bolsa Familia welfare program ranges from two to 1,140 reais ($1 to $570). The average paid amount is 86 reais ($43).
On average in Brazil, each family receives about 245 reais per month ($122) from social welfare programs.

According to the Ministry of Development, there are still 600,000 families in extreme poverty in Brazil. In 2003, before the Bolsa Familia program was launched, there were 8,5 million families in this situation.
Economists interviewed by Folha said it was necessary to take into account other aspects – not only family income – before it was possible to talk about eradicating poverty.
"A person is no longer poor when the person has housing, clothing, education, health and employment and is able to finance themselves,” says Socorro Lira, coordinator of the Development and Environment PhD at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI).
Jaíra Alcobaça, also from UFPI, says initiatives that bring any kind of improvement to the quality of life are important, but need to be seen as emergency actions. He says that welfare assistance should take into account regional differences.
Folha visited Luiza in her brick house. It was built by her brother after her old home, a mud house, collapsed. In her kitchen, there was bread, two coconuts and a small portion of rice. “I have enough to eat only because I have meals at my mothers,” she said.
After four years of fighting the Department of Education over campus sexual assault policies, Harvard Law has lost.
The Department's Office for Civil Rights announced Tuesday that Harvard had violated Title IX, the provision of the 1972 Education Amendments now being used to justify colleges adjudicating felony charges of sexual assault.
OCR determined that, essentially, Harvard Law was providing its students accused of sexual assault with too many due process rights — which under the new Title IX interpretation must stop.
OCR found that Harvard Law was not adjudicating sexual harassment and sexual assault claims in a “prompt and equitable” fashion.
“In one instance, the Law School took over a year to make its final determination and the complainant was not allowed to participate in this extended appeal process, which ultimately resulted in the reversal of the initial decision to dismiss the accused student and dismissal of the complainant's complaint,” the OCR announcement said.
Basically, a student appealed Harvard Law's “guilty” decision and won — and under the current climate of how sexual assault must be handled (i.e., accused must be found guilty) this was wrong.
So now, Harvard Law must adopt new policies, including lowering the burden of proof to “preponderance of the evidence,” meaning faculty members only have to be 50.01 percent sure an accuser is telling the truth in order to convict the accused student and ruin his or her life.
Harvard Law must also reopen all sexual harassment accusations filed during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 school years to “carefully scrutinize whether the Law School investigated the complaints consistent with Title IX and provide any additional remedies necessary for the complainants.” This means that students who may have been acquitted will now be retried under new policies designed to find them guilty. In a criminal court, we would call this “double jeopardy.”
These new policies, despite the promise of being “equitable” to students.
In October, 28 current and former Harvard Law faculty members — including President Obama's mentor Charles Ogletree — denounced the changes already taken by the university in reforming its campus sexual assault policies. At the time, the faculty members wrote that the new policies lacked even “the most basic elements of fairness and due process.”
Alan Dershowitz, a self-identified liberal who signed that letter, later told the Boston Globe that the new policies “are written to preclude a defense.”
Now, Harvard Law students will be forced to live under a different set of rules than the ones they are being taught.
Katy Morgan-Davies says she is waiving anonymity to retrieve identity stolen from her by ‘narcissist' Aravindan Balakrishnan
The “slave” daughter of the Maoist cult leader Aravindan Balakrishnan has revealed her identity for the first time as her father was jailed for 23 years for her imprisonment and repeated sex attacks on two followers.
Katy Morgan-Davies, 33, who spent the first thirty years of her life in Comrade Bala's south London revolutionary collective, waived her legal right to anonymity.

Balakrishnan, 75, ran the Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought from 1976 to 2013 and was sentenced at Southwark crown court on Friday for his daughter's false imprisonment, child cruelty and the rape, sexual assault and assault of two other female followers.
Showing her face to the media for the first time, Morgan-Davies told how her father was “a narcissist and a psychopath” whose actions were “horrible, so dehumanising and degrading”. She called on him to “recognise what he did was wrong”.
But Morgan-Davies says she has forgiven her father and would like to be reconciled with him some day. “Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you leave the prison with hatred and anger and bitterness, then you are still in prison,'” she said.
Her comments came as Judge Deborah Taylor told the India-born communist he was guilty of “grave and serious crimes committed over a long period and you have no remorse whatsoever”.
She revealed he had been diagnosed by a psychiatrist as having a narcissistic personality disorder and had caused significant psychological harm to his daughter.
The judge told Balakrishnan that he had evolved into “a largely housebound demagogue or dictator” who beat and humiliated his followers. “You were ruthless in your exploitation of them,” Taylor said.
His sexual abuse and rape of two women had had profound effects on their lives, Taylor said, praising his rape victims for their great courage in confronting the past by testifying against him.
She said he told his daughter that if she left the collective “she would be killed by fascist death squads or would spontaneously combust”, while in her adulthood “you deprived her of friendship and love”.
Balakrishnan ruled the small, mainly female collective with violence and psychological terror, including threatening members with an electronic satellite warfare machine he called Jackie and claimed would strike them dead if they stepped out of line.
Morgan-Davies said she wanted people to know who she was “to retrieve the identity the cult tried to steal from me” after spending the first 30 years of her life inside Balakrishnan's collective which he set up on a mission to bring down the “British fascist state”.
The trial jury heard how he beat his daughter as a young child, would not allow her to play with other children and did not let her go out of the commune alone until she finally escaped in October 2013, aged 30. When she left, her carers said she had the life skills of a six-year-old, with no knowledge of how to cross the road or use domestic appliances.
Her new name represents a rejection of what she was called in the collective, Prem Maopinduzi, meaning “love revolution” in Hindi and Swahili. She said it was inspired in part by the Katy Perry song Roar, which talks of empowerment and finding your own voice. “It is about not being put down, coming back, standing up for yourself,” she said.

Morgan-Davies said she wanted to escape from being the “non-person” she was under her father who “was just obsessed about control”.
“The people he looked up to were people like Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein,” she said. “You couldn't criticise them either in the house. They were his gods and his heroes.”
At the same time, she said, Balakrishnan wanted to be first among dictators. “Sometimes he would say he didn't like Mao, because he saw Mao as a rival to him as well,” she said. “So he sort of followed them and wanted to be like them, but at the same time he didn't want them to be worshipped, except as secondary to him. [He wanted to be] bigger than all of them.”
She said their cult was seen as a “pilot unit” where Balakrishnan could learn “how best to control people” before he took over the world.
Morgan-Davies was born to Sian Davies, one of Balakrishnan's small group of followers, but Balakrishnan was married to another collective member and he lied to “Prem” that her parents were dead. She only found her relation to Davies when her mother lay dying in hospital after an unexplained fall from a commune window in 1996 following a mental breakdown.
“I remember I used to dream about her a lot, and I used to wake up crying,” Morgan-Davies said. “I used to dream that I said: ‘I know you are my mum'. Or I would say: ‘I didn't know you were my mum, nice to meet you as my mum'. I would hug her – things she never used to do in real life. Then I would wake up and I would cry.”

She spoke of her new-found joy at the freedom to do “things like dyeing my hair or piercing my ears or having an alcoholic drink – something just small might not mean much to most people but for me it does. Just having that choice, being free to make that choice, that is the main thing.” Other pleasures included having her own key and being able to come and go as she pleased, she said.
Morgan-Davies said she was now making up for her lack of any formal education by studying English and maths at college, where she was making friends with classmates. “The main thing is I have joined the Labour party,” she said. “I have been out canvassing and made a lot of friends there and get to do a lot of different things. I also get to go to different locations.”
Starved of love and companionship in the collective, Morgan-Davies would retreat into fantasy and tried to befriend rats and mice she heard scuttling under the floor. “I used to sit there and look at them and hope that I could pet them. They would come and look and I used to think they were smiling at me almost, telling me everything would be all right.”
Josephine Herivel, the commune member who helped Morgan-Davies flee the commune, has since said she deeply regrets the decision and that she believes Balakrishnan, who she calls AB, is innocent.
Leaving the court, Herivel shouted: “This is a political persecution. AB has been framed. He is a good man.”

Herivel has been diagnosed with Stockholm syndrome, when hostages or trafficking victims sympathise with their captors, but rejects that assessment.
Speaking outside the court, Eleri Morgan, 66, Morgan-Davies's cousin, said she was now looking forward to taking her to Tregaron in Wales to show where her mother Sian grew up. Asked about Balakrishnan's sentence she said: “Let him be locked up for once.”
In a victim impact assessment one of Balakrishnan's rape victims said she suffered nightmares in which she was “surrounded by cult members and Balakrishnan would be trying to hold on to me as I made my escape”.
The woman spoke of the years of sexual abuse by Balakrishnan, saying she was “traumatised, shocked and horrified at what he habituated me to and against which I had no defence. I will live with this torment for the rest of my life.”
The other rape victim described Balakrishnan as “such an evil force” and said she suffered fear and nightmares. “He wreaked havoc on every part of my life before and after I left,” she said. “He literally shattered my life.” She said she had never managed to fully rebuild her family relationships.
Morgan-Davies said in her victim statement that she lived in constant fear and still found it difficult to trust people or get close to them. She said she remains terrified of shouting and physical pain.
Balakrishnan will serve at least half his sentence which means he will be 87 before he is eligible for parole.
“We've often talked in the past about the Strait of Hormuz being closed up. But the Bab al Mandeb and the Red Sea are so important for a couple of reasons. For one you have this flow of commerce that goes up to the Suez Canal. Anything going through the Suez Canal is feeding the Egyptian economy. We really can't afford to have a reduction to the Egyptian economy. It's fragile and we can't have that. The other piece that happens is, diverting around the Red Sea and Bab al Mandeb is something potentially that the oil industry may be able to accommodate with some initial cost, but industries like liquid natural gas, there is no excess capacity in the transporting of it, nor is there excess storage capacity at the destinations. So any kind of slowdown in traffic through the Bab al Mandeb is going to have a pretty quick impact on both the region but also on the global supply of energy. Because of that just-in-time liquid natural gas piece, there'll be a delay before the oil will be able to move in a different direction, and then you'll have the impact on the local economies that are getting their money—especially Egypt.”

Lesson #345 - Referees
There really aren't any referees who can influence a game more than a ref in soccer (red and yellow cards are true power) or a baseball umpire (they get to make a potentially arbitrary call on every pitch!), but they still aren't as rage-inducing as what you can get from a football or basketball ref. Cheap hand fouls and poorly called charges in basketball, and the completely insane will-he-call-it-or-won't-he-call-it pass interference in football . . . if refs take over the game as much as they do, that certainly takes away from your enjoyment, which is probably why we favor baseball and hockey over the other sports.

On many issues, large portions of the American right wing lack the ability to empathize with others who do not share their personal life experiences or demographics—this lack of empathy leads them to support discriminatory policies unless some event in their personal lives forces them to experience the effects of that bigotry.
The empathy blind spot within the right wing is most clear on the issues of gay rights, disability protections, mental health care, and other demographic characteristics that can emerge later in life (a person comes out of the closet, gets disabled in an accident, develops a mental illness, etc.).
For example, Rob Portman (R-OH) spent most of his career supporting anti-gay policies, but he switched sides to support gay rights upon discovering that his own son is gay. The fact that his own son would feel the consequences of anti-gay policies woke Portman up to the harm that his policies were causing those not related to him, thus he became more liberal on the issue of gay equality.
Given the lack of natural empathy on the part of the right wing, it is sometimes a good tactic to personalize an issue while debating the right and translate it into a form that they can see affecting them. By doing this, we can short-circuit some of the reflexive partisan dogma that is flung in response to proposing liberal policies, and can sometimes illustrate to even the most extreme right winger the negative sides of their policies.
The Wage Gap
Yesterday, the GOP in the Senate blocked the passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act that is aimed at ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work. This is part of a long-term pattern of the GOP blocking all legislation that aims to address the gender-based wage gap in the United States (ex. the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act).
Currently female workers in the United States are paid proportionately less than men for their labor. While this gap has been measured at 77% for all full-time year round workers, this statistic is somewhat deceptive because it fails to take into account certain factors that might affect wages (ex. maternity or job choice). A far better measure than this global average is a comparative analysis, which accounts for these factors; such comparative studies indicate that the gender pay-gap is likely between 89% and 94% based upon income level (the pay gap widens at higher incomes).
Even if we assume that the gender pay gap is between 89% and 94% rather than the abysmal 77%, it is still a major problem that threatens the economic health of families and flies in the face of a fair society.
Creating Equal Pay Empathy
Given their history of blocking reform on the issue of equal pay, the right wing, as a collective, clearly lacks the ability to empathize with women who suffer from wage inequality—even female Republican politicians may lack this empathy because they are guaranteed equal pay with their male coworkers under federal law. In order to build empathy on this issue, progressives can put the issue of wage inequality in the language of taxation (an issue that the right wing tends to be hypersensitive about).
When women make only 89% of what men make, it is the functional equivalent to taking an 11%, non-deductible and non-marginal, tax off of the top of their total income; the only functional difference between the wage gap and gender-based taxation is that the money from taxation goes into maintaining society while the wage gap losses are pocketed as profits by private interests.
While talking with a right wing ideologue who doesn't support mandating gender equality, ask him to imagine that all men have an additional tax of 11% on their income, merely because they are male and should be taxed more because of it. This would put the shoe on the other foot by imposing the unfair wage losses on men in a way that is sure to draw the ire of the very right wing men who have no problem with women making less money.
In response to this question, the right winger will almost certainly react with outrage over the idea that one gender would have such discriminatory, arbitrary, and unfair taxation levied against it. They will rail against the evils of stealing the income of an entire gender demographic and will call such a policy un-American.
Put simply, their reaction to this special gender-based taxation would the correct one, as it is absurd to discriminate against members of a gender by having them take home 11% less than those of the other gender for the exact same work.
Once you listen to these right wingers' outrage, just point out how this tax has an identical effect to the current wage gap harming women—they just simply fail to recognize this fact because they have never actually thought about the unfairness of the wage gap if it were applied to them.
After they are exposed to this analogy, the right winger is forced to either concede how arbitrary and unfair the wage gap is or to retreat into some type of rationalization that rejects the comparison (ex. taxation is imposed by the government while wages are set by the private sector). I have no doubt that many extremists will take the latter path and will completely block out this entire argument, but I also have some hope that more rational individuals will reflect on the gaping hole in their thought processes illustrated by this comparison and decide to change their minds on supporting pay equality.

Back before Mark Wahlberg was Mark Wahlberg, and even before he was Marky Mark, he was a teenage hooligan. In 1988, a 16-year-old Wahlberg attacked Thanh Lam, breaking a stick over his head and calling him a “Vietnam fucking shit.” Running away from the scene of that crime, he then punched another Vietnamese man Hoa Trinh in the face so severely he blinded him in one eye. According to the police report, he then made a number of “unsolicited racial statements about ‘gooks' and ‘slant-eyed gooks.'” Wahlberg was tried as an adult and sentenced to two years in prison. He was released after 45 days.
Wahlberg is petitioning the state of Massachusetts to have this expunged from his record. “I am deeply sorry for the actions that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims,” Wahlberg wrote in his pardon application. “Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others.” However, it should be noted that nowhere in Wahlberg's petition does he mention the racially charged nature of the violence. He does, however, note that the police found pot on him and that he was stoned and drunk while carrying out the crimes.
In another incident in 1986, Wahlberg was with two friends and yelled racial slurs and threw rocks at two black elementary-school girls. One of the rocks hit Kristyn Atwood, then 9, in the head. “When people talk about racism in Boston, I always remember that,” Atwood told the Boston Globe. The state's attorney general filed a civil complaint against him and his friends, but the complaint was dismissed in 1987. You can probably file this under #CrimingWhileWhite.
The device has been the major talking point of the final two days of pre-season testing at Barcelona, with the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel having used it during installation runs.
While some drivers, notably Vettel, have voiced their support for Halo, Hulkenberg has been one of its most strident critics, saying on Thursday: "For me it looks horrible.
"I think it sterilises the sport. There needs to be an element of danger that makes it sexy and attractive and that's also what Formula 1 needs. Back in the day it was a lot more."
When quizzed by the media on the topic on Friday, however, Ricciardo was perplexed by the Force India driver's comments.
“I heard Hulkenberg say some things I don't agree with, because there's no need to be a hero about the situation,” said the Australian.
“It doesn't change the sport, or the speed of the car – it's just if there are any flying objects, it's an extra bit of protection for us.
“I don't know why he's puffing his chest out for something like that, it doesn't make sense.”
While Lewis Hamilton also described Halo as the “worst-looking mod in F1 history”, Ricciardo says he doesn't think it is too detrimental to the aesthetics of grand prix racing.
“The cars from 2008 to 2009 had a big change [visually], the cars were ugly,” he added. “The halo isn't as dramatic as that.”
Trump has held at least a six-point lead, or more, for four consecutive days in the LA Times daily tracker. Clearly a lasting shift has materialized. Today, he receives 47.7% to Hillary's 41.0%, nearly a seven-point lead.
The media attacked Trump Friday night and all day Saturday for his pointed criticism of Hillary's hypocrisy on gun control. She advocates stricter gun control and will appoint a Supreme Court Justice who is likely to vote with the current four-seat liberal bloc to severely restrict gun rights in America.
Much of the media alleged that Trump was calling for violence against Clinton when it seemed that he was just making the point that she is hypocritical. He argued that she would take citizens' guns and keep hers. Despite the widespread media attack on Trump, his lead in this poll actually increased by nearly a point.
This inability of the media to move Trump's numbers with its virtually unanimous condemnation of Trump seems to signal that the mainstream media has lost much of its influence, as a Gallup poll this week showing that only 32% of Americans trust the media, including only 14% of Republicans and 30% of Independents, seems to demonstrate.

Ranchi, July 22: A visually challenged 16-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped by a Dalit youth of the same village in Panki area of Palamau, 40km from district headquarters in Daltonganj and 175km from the capital, late on Wednesday night, but her farmer father instead of going to the police directly, first went to the local panchayat.
A local source said the father, a manual labourer, asked the influential panchayat for "justice" yesterday and when it did not work out approached the police in the evening. What the father wanted the panchayat to do is not yet confirmed.
This morning, the girl's medical test was done at Daltonganj Sadar Hospital and her statement taken, DSP Prabhat Ranjan Barwar said. DSP Barwar said the report confirming rape had not yet arrived.
The culprit, Mangra Bhuiyan, a 22-year-old jobless Dalit, is absconding.
According to the girl's statement, she was asleep at home when the youth knocked on the door. As she knew him by voice and her father was asleep in the adjoining room, she opened the door without fear. But, the youth allegedly caught her and raped her.
By the time the girl's screams awoke her father, Mangra had fled, the girl told the police.
Apparently, the visually impaired girl hardly ever went out of home. Initially, both the girl and her father were apparently afraid of going to the police. Right now, the girl, who is in a state of shock, has been sent home.
"We are doing our best and keeping watch on the movements of Mangra Bhuiyan's friends and relatives. Mangra will be caught soon," the DSP stressed.
Recently, on July 17, three minor boys had sneaked inside a hostel for physically challenged girls in Hiranpur area of Pakur district and molested at least two sleeping minor girls and were fast asleep. The boy who was caught claimed he was a sleepwalker while his two had managed to flee. The girls had alleged their clothes had been torn with blades when they were sleeping.
(Andy Synn reviews the forthcoming sixth studio album from the Ukrainian band Kroda — GinnungaGap-GinnungaGaldr-GinnungaKaos — and we also have for you the premiere of the album's fourth track, “Чорні Хребти Карпат” (Carpathian Black Spines).
There are some albums you just never really get on with. Not that they're necessarily bad, but albums you just don't “click” with, for whatever reason. Where the pieces just don't seem to line up properly and the overall package just seems lacking.
Then there are albums that you fall in love with instantly, where even their tiniest flaws seem to have a necessary place in the grand scheme of things.
This is one of those albums.
Now Schwarzpfad, Kroda's previous full-length, is one of my favourite Black Metal albums, and stands a good chance of being held up for consideration as one of my favourite albums in general. So this sets a ridiculously high bar for the band's latest to live up to.
And, under duress, I'd probably admit that GinnungaGap… isn't quite the masterpiece its predecessor was.
But it's close. Very, very close.
With the proggy excesses of the previous album reined in somewhat (where Schwarzpfad contained 5 tracks with an average length of around 10 minutes, GinnungaGap… has 8, with an average length more in the 4-5 minute range) it's a more direct and song-focussed effort in many ways, with each and every one a gloriously anthemic display of true passion.
Indeed, utilising a more restrained song length is actually a rather brilliant – albeit simple — decision, allowing the album to stand on its own two feet and step outside of the grand shadow cast by its predecessor, playing purposefully to its own strengths and carving out its own distinctive sonic identity.
From the pulsing blasts and radiant blackened energy of “На Крилах Шторму”, to the captivating tremolo hooks and soaring guitar harmonies of “Чорні Хребти Карпат” (Carpathian Black Spines), to the sweeping melodic grandeur of “Туманом Снігової Імли”, every single track on GinnungaGap… positively bristles with righteous fury and fiery conviction, weaving its grand, folklore-ish melodies and epic, haunting atmospherics in amongst a pulse-pounding cavalcade of rough-hewn riffs and raging vocals with consummate ease.
The tone and texture of the songs reminds me, oddly enough, of early Dark Tranquillity at points, while some of the heavier, more infectious rhythms definitely recall early Hypocrisy. And, of course, with the album's deft mixing of proggy undercurrents of cosmic melody with majestic blackened riffage (“Прірва Себе” being a perfect example), comparisons with Isa/Ruun-era Enslaved are more than valid.
Yet, like all of Kroda's albums, GinnungaGap… remains clearly distinct from these influences. They are, in truth, little more than reference points drawn on by this reviewer to make some useful comparisons. Because simply saying that GinnungaGap… sounds like Kroda doesn't seem sufficient, beyond establishing that this sees the band remaining at the very top of their game.
So far, this has been an impressive year for Black Metal, in all its forms, already. And, off the top of my head, there's a number of “big” releases still scheduled to come our way in the vast and misty field of folk-influenced Black Metal alone, not least with legendary acts like Negură Bunget and Drudkh (among others) either having just released, or just about to release, new albums of their own.
Yet where Negură Bunget stumbled with the oddly disjointed Tau, and Drudkh continue to plough a familiar furrow of their own making, Ginnungagap… brims with a vitality and unabashed creative energy that's simply unmatched.
Pulse-raising in its undeniable passion, and surprisingly life-affirming in its boundless energy and vigour, Ginnungagap… is Kroda at their very best, marrying power and pathos, might and majesty, primal fury and grand, storytelling ambition, in a display of absolutely stunning harmony and balance.
GinnungaGap-GinnungaGaldr-GinnungaKaos will be released on Walpurgisnacht, 2015. For further details as they come, visit these links:

Ruth comments on EU referendum result
24 Jun 2016
Speaking at the party headquarters in Edinburgh, she said:
Good afternoon
This morning I spoke to the Prime Minister and offered my thanks on behalf of the party in Scotland for his service to this country.
He has served Britain honourably for these last six years and I know he will discharge his duties these final few months with the same diligence and love of country that has marked his tenure.
I will speak to the First Minister this afternoon.
I am pleased they have both been in discussion already today, and that the Prime Minister has already made it clear that the devolved administrations will be fully involved in the negotiations that will now follow.
That is the right way forward. Such co-operation will be vital as we chart our way forward.
All of us, and both our governments, need to work together for the common good, and in the awareness that families and businesses today are fearful for the future, and need reassurance.
That requires a calm, measured response to the challenges we face – and a commitment to put our separate political priorities to one side to enable discussion and co-operation.
As everyone knows, last night's decision was not the outcome I campaigned for in this referendum. It was not the result I sought and I am deeply saddened that this is where we are.
There can be no avoiding the fact eta-i.org/provigil.html that the days ahead will not be easy.
We are being tested.
But I still have no doubt that all of us – Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales – will come through this test as we have come through trials before.
To do that we need to work together – we need to come together.
Let me close by referring to the First Minister's comments just now.
Like the First Minister I am disappointed with the result.
Like the First Minister I want to see stability prioritised in the days ahead. Scotland will open for business next week in the same way as it closes today.
But I do not believe that a second independence referendum will help us achieve that stability nor that it is in the best interests of the people of Scotland.
The 1. 6 million votes cast in this referendum in favour of remain, do not wipe away the 2 million votes that we cast less than two years ago.
And we do not address the challenges of leaving the European Union by leaving our own Union of nations, our biggest market and our closest friends.
I believe in Scotland's place within the United Kingdom today as much as ever.
And I believe that – in or out of the European Union – the strength, security and durability of the United Kingdom will endure.
Thankyou.

Last time... Last time we've discussed guard clauses and when not to use them. We've discussed the paranoia developers sometimes feel that causes them to write useless or even harmful guard clauses. The best way to reduce paranoia about None is to make sure it can't be there in the first place. So let's talk about ways to accomplish this.
Edge case This handwaves the edge case where start_date and end_date are both equal to INDEFINITE_PAST or INDEFINITE_FUTURE , which can be argued should not raise ValidationError . In software for a time machine it might be important to get this right, but in many applications not handling this edge case is fine.
Really avoiding the edge cases If we insist on making the edge case go away, we could deal with it by subclassing the date class to construct these sentinels instead: class IndefinitePast(date): def __lt__(self, other): return True def __le__(self, other): return True def __gt__(self, other): return False def __ge__(self, other): return False class IndefiniteFuture(date): def __lt__(self, other): return False def __le__(self, other): return False def __gt__(self, other): return True def __ge__(self, other): return True INDEFINITE_PAST = IndefinitePast(datetime.MINYEAR, 1, 1) INDEFINITE_FUTURE = IndefiniteFuture(datetime.MAXYEAR, 12, 31) This is a lot more code though, and therefore in many situations this would be overkill. (As a puzzle for the reader in this case one could safely skip implementing __le__ and __ge__ for these classes and still have it all work for any possible date. I kept them in for clarity.)
Normalization So what have we done here? We've made sure that our input was normalized to a date before it even reached the validation function. This way we don't have to worry about our friend None when we deal with dates. The idea is to normalize the input a soon as possible before it reaches the rest of our codebase, so we can stop worrying about non-normalized cases (such as None ) everywhere else. In effect you put the guard clauses as far on the outside of the calling chain as possible. In the case of our date input, somewhere in the input processing we'd call these functions: def process_start_date(d): if d is None: return INDEFINITE_PAST return d def process_end_date(d): if d is None: return INDEFINITE_FUTURE return d None of those None 's to worry about anymore after that!
Drawbacks Normalization also has some potential drawbacks. Here are some that may apply to this case: to understand how empty date fields are treated in the validation function, we need to read normalization code that may be somewhere else. Our validation function that worried about None was all in one place.
it's more code to understand and maintain, especially with the custom date subclasses.
normalization of None to a date may be nice during validation, but it may not be what we want to store in a database; we might want to store None there. If we have this requirement we'd need two code paths: one for storage and one for validation. It all depends on the exact details of your project. If the project is going to compare a lot of dates in many places, it makes sense to normalize missing values to proper dates as soon as possible, and it's a much better approach than having to worry about None everywhere. But if the project only needs a single validation rule that can handle missing dates, then it makes more sense to write one that deals with None directly.
As women, how often do we really see each other au naturel and actually feel comfortable?
When I was a schoolgirl in the U.S., I quickly mastered the art of changing my clothes in the locker room without even so much as shining as an ankle. Modesty was so prevalent, it was as though we were expected to somehow keep our clothes on even while getting undressed.
So when I accidentally found myself at a nudist spa retreat in the middle of the Austrian Alps last winter, it wasn't surprising that I began to think about my body-baggage.
As my friend and I headed into the spa area, we expected to see fluffy white towels, bathing suits and bodies of all shapes and sizes. But instead, all that anybody was wearing was a birthday suit. I cringed. I didn't sign up for this. I reverted back to that shy, seventh grade schoolgirl in the locker room.
Looking around the sea of naked bodies I felt immense shame. I don't wax. I have stretch marks on my hips from having a baby. My left boob is a little bigger than my right boob. When was the last time I shaved my legs? Oh my God, that 50-year-old woman's breasts are bigger than mine. Will my ass look like that when I'm 70? No. God no! At least I exercise. Well, I guess I'm thinner than she is. And so on.
My friend sighed, looked at me and said, "I think it's considered rude if we don't take our clothes off." Rude?! So I refused, but after our first sauna, I began to understand the logic behind the no-clothes policy. I was seriously overheating. With a deep inhale (and an enormous sigh!) I took off my top.
My ... boobs ... There they were. I realized I had an easier time taking my shirt off in front of a sexual partner, than baring my breasts in public.
But instead of fixating on how my girls looked, I decided to redirect my focus to why I felt so much shame. Why was it my first impulse to compare my body to everyone else's? Why was I cataloging every inch of cellulite I saw? Why was I obsessing over how awful I thought I looked?
Here are five liberating reasons why you shouldn't be afraid to get naked:
1. "Perfect" is an illusion.
Even though I'm happy with my body most of the time, I still feel an immense pressure to appear "perfect". From an early age I was taught how to make myself more appealing to men — how to flirt, wear heels, short skirts, wax my eyebrows, slather on makeup, etc. And still, when all the clothes come off, I tend to worry about all the imperfections because let's face it, none of us are airbrushed.
"Imperfection" means there is an object of perfection, and that is just not true. Every body is different. As I looked around the spa that day it wasn't my body that separated me from everyone else, it was my attitude.
2. Being vulnerable in front of others is a good thing.
In Europe — Germany especially — it's perfectly normal to lose the swimsuit and go for a dip in the buff. Going to the sauna is a beloved pastime and it's generally understood that everyone will be unclad. At the yoga studio where I teach, there's even a coed sauna room in the basement — in case you didn't sweat enough in class. I've found that seeing other bodies in the nude can make us more comfortable in our own skin, if we're willing to sit with the discomfort and fear.
3. When you judge other people, you judge yourself.
I realized I was afraid to confront my own self-judgment. Instead of practicing self-compassion, I defaulted to fear. Society has taught us to judge and criticize, instead of to love and care for ourselves and others.
The first time I stood at the front of a yoga classroom as a teacher, and saw everyone in Downward Dog, I realized just how many different down dogs there were. They didn't look the ones you see in magazines, nor did they look like mine. But it was still a beautiful sight to see, nonetheless.
When you compare yourself to other people, it's a form of self-harm. We have to take care of our bodies physically and emotionally, and sometimes it's equally important — if not more important — to have an emotional fitness routine as well. Meditation is highly effective for this.
4. When you become comfortable being naked, you'll feel less inclined to wear makeup and heels.
I was never a girly-girl — it's just not my natural state. Sometimes I feel like wearing lipstick (but most of the time I don't) but I finally realized and accepted that this is OK. Making myself up was a way of putting myself down. Losing the costume helped me feel comfortable with just being myself.
5. Baring your bits to Mother Nature feels really good.
Like the snow on the pristine Alpine peaks, my body too will one day melt away. My bottom will get saggy and my skin will wrinkle.
If practicing yoga has taught me anything, it's that I am not my body and I am not my mind. Everything in this world is material, and is subject to constant change. Even sitting here now and writing this, my body is changing. My skin is a material barrier to the world around me and somehow taking my clothes off on that mountain, made me feel more at peace with nature and with myself.
Criterion of “good” passwords has long been defined by confusing rules, outdated advice, and recently by those annoying colored “password strength” bars on websites. Ultimately, understanding password strength requires you understand what you're defending against. Passwords have to be stored in a database by the site that requires them of you – where it can (and will) be stolen by hackers. Password databases are protected against this eventuality, but once stolen hackers can go to work cracking them at their leisure.
Ergo, the primary requirement for a password is that it be as hard as possible for a hacker to crack. This equates “hard to guess,” because almost every technique to crack passwords revolves around guessing the password. Passwords in a database are typically protected by “hashing;” they're fed into a clever mathematical algorithm that scrambles them up in such a way that it's impossible to “reverse engineer” what the original password string was. The algorithm is typically an openly known standard (like SHA-1 or MD5 to give two examples;) the security lies in the service provider only storing the derived data, the scrambled-up string from which the password cannot be “reverse-engineered.” Every time you enter your password on the site, it's quickly hashed and the scrambled (“hashed”) value compared to the one in the database. This way, the vendor/service provider's website never actually stores the passwords themselves where they can be stolen by hackers.
What an attacker can do, however, is attack the password from the other end. The need to quickly compute the hash every time a user enters their password (for quick comparison) means that generating hashes for comparison to a stolen database of password hashes can be done very fast. Thus guessing the password is a viable attack. It's the oldest trick in the book, and exactly the thing most old password rules (symbols, numbers, limited login attempts) were meant to defeat. That was enough in days of yore, especially when sensitive systems tended to be mainframes with only on-premises terminal access, but modern hackers steal and download entire password databases. Yesteryear threats were like safecrackers with a stethoscope. Modern threats involve stealing the whole safe and taking it home to meet the cutting torches.
Old Tricks, New Tools
The simplest way of guessing a password has always been trying every possible password combination as fast as possible till one matches up – the “brute force” attack. (This is why sites almost always require a minimum password length; each additional character increases the number of possible combinations exponentially.) For a long time “brute forcing” passwords was an uncommon threat; it'd take a state actor (or a determined corporate rival) to build an expensive computer cluster to muster the raw computing power needed to get results before the heat death of the Universe. Moore's law shook that paradigm, the advent of dual and then quad-core processors shifted it, and modern video cards (whose processors are optimized for highly repetitive video-processing tasks very similar to password cracking processing) definitively killed it. A modern computer with a single video card can process billions of password guesses every second against “fast” hashes (which most sites use for aforementioned reasons.)
Brute-force attacks alone are still relatively easy to defeat, of course. The fact that they're even possible on consumer-grade equipment simply illustrates how much computing power is now available to password crackers. When that power's used intelligently it gets much, much worse. Cryptanalysis is a science centuries old – combining it with modern computing power puts password cracking into the hands of even untrained “script kiddies.” The threat vector is vast.
Pattern Recognition
From its earliest days, cryptanalysis has always been about recognizing patterns, and unfortunately password requirements hand would-be hackers pre-set patterns to exploit:
The passwords are being made by human beings, who tend to gravitate to the same general solutions when faced with the same problem.
All these people have the same problem – they need to be able to remember the password.
And they need to adhere to the “password rules” enforced by the website/service itself in the name of making sure their passwords are secure.
Those considerations instantly remove billions of possible combinations from the pool of possible guesses just with a few simple “rules.” Combined with databases of commonly-used words (“dictionary attacks”) and some educated guesstimations from the crackers, the efficiency of the password-guessing can be increased drastically. As illustrated by this excellent arsTechnica article, a hacker can crack 10,000 hashed passwords in just 16 minutes with a combination of brute-forcing, a few educated guesses, and the use of dictionary attacks to limit the “possibility space” to something manageable in minutes rather than months.
The sheer amount of data available to hackers to study is what makes these guesses so educated. Once upon a time this was the realm of clever government spies perusing peer-reviewed psychology studies – but now anyone can download millions of cracked passwords dumped on the internet over the years for use as a vast database that quickly reveals common trends in the passwords people make. The advent of “machine learning” (programming a computer to recognize patterns on its own) makes this terrifyingly effective. Hackers turn their software loose on that vast body of data to “train” their software very well. Worse, it makes site-specific attacks much more effective: weak passwords broken by simple brute-force/word-list attacks can be used to “train” the software in patterns that the longer, more difficult passwords are likely to follow as well. Even comparatively simple machine-learning techniques can be effective, such as the Markov chain – who's mathematics were invented over one hundred years ago. If such dated techniques can produce solid results, one shudders to think what a good intruder (with funding, motivation and support) could accomplish.
Thankfully, you can fight back against this effectively – by removing the patterns entirely.
Randomization and Password Management
Passwords – unlike messages or metadata – can be entirely arbitrary; they're not required to convey any specific information on their lonesome. Thus one can make them entirely random, which at one stroke removes any and all patterns that all those sophisticated cracking methods sniff out. A good random password generator can generate perfectly random passwords with a simple mouse-click.
Unfortunately perfectly random passwords are ungainly things that are hard to remember – and due to the usual security risks, you need a different password for every website/service, as the point of stealing passwords is to gain access to multiple other sites using the same credentials.
This is what password managers are for – and precisely why a password manager needs a good password generator to go with it. FreePAVE/TeamPAVE include one for this very reason; as do all serious competitors. Care must be taken when using password generator web apps: Generating properly (cryptographically secure) random data in browsers is hard (the naive Math.random() method is not random enough and window.crypto not supported by all browsers,) and it is difficult for users to determine whether a website is using a safe algorithm – password managers are the safer bet.
This leaves us with a final problem – you still need a password to get into your password manager, and you need to be able to remember it. Pass phrases made of random words (as suggested by XKCD) are easy to remember and can be just as safe as other passwords – as long as they are properly randomized (with a password generator), and not “made up”. Diceware pass phrases (with six or seven words) are easily generated, lacking other alternatives.Still, utilizing software to automate password management is the best – perhaps the only – solid counter to the increased automation of password cracking in the modern era.
The VR community was hit with quite a shock yesterday. Guerrilla Cambridge, the Sony-owned developer behind PlayStation VR multiplayer FPS, RIGS: Mechanised Combat League [Review: 8/10], was confirmed to be closing just a few months on from the game's launch last October.
Needless to say, shutting the doors to the studio behind one of the biggest titles on the new hardware comes as a big surprise. RIGS might not have exactly been the new Call of Duty, but it was one of the better reviewed games among Sony's launch line-up and one of the two full gamepad-based FPS games to hit the headset, the other being World War Toons. In our 2016 VR Game of the Year Awards, we named RIGS our PS VR Game of the Year.
Initially it had been assumed that Cambridge was about to embark upon a lengthy DLC roll out plan for the game, which would have kicked off with December's Winter Update, but it looks like that may not be the case any longer. DLC might not be dead entirely (Sony didn't respond to our questions about if it could continue), but it won't be Cambridge making it.
Studio closures are an unfortunate part of the games industry, but this is the first time we've seen a developer behind a high-profile VR game shut down. That makes this news all the sadder; Cambridge was one of the pioneers of a new industry and it's closing its doors far too early as far as we're concerned, even considering its 19-year history. But the UK studio did take some important steps for the early days of VR with its lone HMD release, and it's only right that we don't forget them.
I was one of the first people to play RIGS following its reveal at E3 2015. In fact, it was the first thing I tried out at that year's show, heading straight for it as soon as the expo hall doors opened. It occupied the entire second floor of a massive structure at Sony's booth.
What struck me about the game was just how refined it was, even almost a year and a half away from launch. Developing gamepad-based FPSs for VR is a risky business considering the potential for motion sickness, but here was a developer that was bullish on its ability to create a comfortable experience, and trusting enough in players that they could handle it.
And they pulled it off.
That's the most important thing RIGS did for VR; it proved you could have frantic, fast-paced multiplayer shooter action in the here and now, defying expectations. Rooting players in a walking mech gave a sense of authenticity to their movements, as their character wasn't actually moving their legs, just comfortably sitting inside those metal frames, much like the player was just sitting on a chair in real life. Granted RIGS wasn't free from comfort issues, but Cambridge's novel foundation is something that more developers should pay attention to when looking at design and circumventing sickness.
You can't overstate the wonders this did for PS VR's launch line-up. Without RIGS, we'd have very little solid proof that the headset could handle non-flight shooters with this kind of ambition. Now as we look out to 2017, it's one of the reasons we're expecting such big things for PS4 VR.
A big part of its appeal was also accessibility. Every time I've jumped into the game I've found myself slipping back into the controls with ease, where I had previously been worried they'd overwhelm me. Cambridge made the most of combining a traditional shooter control scheme with the new features of VR. You could move and steer with your head, for example, but you could also stick to the classic joystick layout.
But RIGS didn't just settle from successfully translating an FPS into VR, it also taught us that innovation in mechanics will be still key to pushing the genre forward in VR just as much as it is for standard displays. Rather than forcing you to lock an eye to your iron sights and have you creep around corners, RIGS embraced the arena shooter. It featured a wide aiming reticle that made it hard to miss and gave the action a snappy pace, dual-wielding weapons had you pressing the attack, and special abilities forced you to use strategy in firefights. It would have been all too easy to imitate contemporary shooters and chase some of the Call of Duty and Battlefield pie, but RIGS instead set itself apart. How many other shooters have a game mode where you need to throw yourself through a goal zone?
Cambridge made a mark on production values, too. At a time when we weren't quite sure if Sony's console could really provide VR experiences that measured up to what we've been seeing on the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, here was a rock solid game with sharp visuals, a stunningly vivid color palette, and an unflinching 60 FPS framerate reprojected into 120FPS.
I also have a lot of admiration for RIGS‘ determination to steer clear of VR violence. It's a rare shooter with a family-friendly, televised-sport tone. The Mechanized Combat League is a futuristic (sadly fictional) sport after all, and Cambridge used this to put a positive spin on the action. Instead of feeling like an action hero, the cheers of the crowd and cries from the commentator made you feel like a team player. Shooting guns might not be the most enlightened use of VR, but here's a game that at least does it in a tasteful way.
Guerrilla Cambridge's demise marked a sad day for the VR industry. This was a team that had made a very good first impression with its first game, and I'll forever be wondering what might have happened if it had had the chance to make a second. While the studio might be gone, the impact it made with RIGS means I, for one, certainly won't forget it any time soon. How Sony fills that gap it's just created in its experienced VR teams will be interesting to see.

ST. PETERSBURG — With frail hands, the cryptologist raised the dust-coated gold plaque off the kitchen counter, bringing it inches from his face. His clouded eyes struggled to make out the words as he scoured the text on which his name — Douglas W. Harold — is buried among hundreds of others.
"What's that?" he asked.
"That's a plaque honoring the On the Roof Gang," his grandson, Nico, replied.
Harold put the award down. He stood still and gazed at the items before him — a commemorative coin from Pearl Harbor, a framed letter from a Navy officer — not speaking, but remembering.
For 38 of his 95 years, Douglas Harold worked as a cryptologist for the U.S. Navy. A veteran of both World War II and the Korean War, he was among an elite group of code breakers — sailors and Marines specially trained to intercept and analyze foreign communications.
In the early days, it was the Japanese. Trainees were brought to Washington, D.C., where they sat inside a steel-reinforced concrete blockhouse on the roof of the Navy Department Building, studying Japanese language and codes. Hence the moniker the On the Roof Gang.
Today, Harold of St. Petersburg is one of five known surviving members of the famed group. Earlier this year, he and the other surviving members were honored with an official declaration from the commander of the U.S. Navy's Fleet Cyber Command, recognizing their pioneering service in naval cryptology and information warfare.
It is an honor, like so many others he has received in his lifetime, that Harold appreciates, but about which he is not overly proud.
As he thumbed items on the kitchen counter in his St. Petersburg home on a recent evening, his hands moved to a small box overflowing with more dusty medals and ribbons.
"Those are your medals," Nico said.
Harold raised a wry smile.
"They're just medals for staying alive," he said.
• • •
The memories come to mind through a haze, like ships idling on a vast and foggy sea. He remembers Pearl Harbor. He remembers getting called to come aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington as they headed out to sea for the initial war effort.
By that time, members of the On the Roof Gang were well acquainted with the duties of intercepting Japanese radio communications. The first class was put into service in 1928. Harold joined in 1934. But it was the first time that Harold had been called upon for his services as a means of war.
He remembers the war's first air assaults — American pilots launching from the Lexington to defend the ship against Japanese pilots in the Battle of the Coral Sea. He remembers looking out a porthole in the ship's hull, seeing the bombs falling as Japanese fighters attacked. He remembers going out to the gun deck, where a bomb crashed into an ammunition box and threw chunks of metal into the chests and upper bodies of a dozen men.
"Am I going to make it?" Harold thought.
To avoid capture, the crew sunk the ship.
"That ocean looks awfully big when you're out there with no support under you," he remembered.
After he was rescued, he returned to Pearl Harbor, later transferring to the USS Yorktown before it shipped to the Battle of Midway Island, where Japanese fighters so badly damaged the ship that it was withdrawn from service.
All the while, Harold worked the radios. He knew when the attacks would come and where.
The hardest parts of Harold's war were over after the Yorktown returned to Pearl Harbor. At the war's end, he was dispatched to China and Japan.
In Shanghai, he was ordered to take a Japanese radio transmitter off the air — a task he accomplished by firing a bullet through its power tube.

It wasn't a life Harold ever envisioned. As a boy growing up in West Virginia during the Great Depression, prospects were few. Harold's father, an electrician, told him there would be little to look forward to if he stayed in his hometown.
So during a vacation in his last year of high school, Harold and a friend went to visit a local Army recruitment office. The commander there was out to lunch, but a Navy recruiter was available across the hall. They left not long after, the Navy's two newest sailors.
"That lunch could have saved your life," Harold's grandson, Nico, said as his grandfather recalled the story.
After a few years as a sailor, Harold read a message that a fleet intelligence officer had sent to hundreds of Navy men. They needed men who met certain requirements, the letter explained, to be part of a new intelligence program.
Harold responded. And soon after, he was among the first members of the On the Roof Gang.
"When you're in your early 20s and 30s you say, 'What? Me? That's not for me,' " Harold said. "I have no regrets."
• • •
Nowadays, Harold does a lot of thinking at his home in St. Petersburg, where Nico cares for him. His health is declining. His vision and hearing have faded. But memories of a life of service and the legacy he passed on make him proud.
He thinks of the places the Navy later took him, traveling to Germany and North Africa for various intelligence operations.
He thinks of the time he spent after the war as an exchange officer in the United Kingdom, conducting national security operations.
He thinks of his family — his wife, Norma, with whom he came to live in St. Petersburg after his retirement from service, a son and grandson who followed in his footsteps. For a brief time, in the early 1970s, all three Harolds were in the service at the same time.
"It has been interesting," Harold said. "It's been a nice life."
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
The Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, pushed two gay men, blindfolded, to their deaths from a roof in Homs, Syria, last August. After plummeting to the ground, with their heads splattering on the concrete, they were stoned by an angry mob, which included children. All of it was recorded and posted to the Internet.
This year, the U.K.-based Observatory for Human Rights estimates at least 25 people have been killed by ISIS for being gay: six stoned, three shot in the head and 16 thrown from highrise buildings.
“The people of Lot,” or so the LGBT community is called by Muslims, a Koranic euphemism for sodomy — are singled out and executed by the religious group simply for being gay.
But perhaps the fact most hidden by the mainstream media is that you don't have to be part of ISIS to believe this. It is part of Muslim Sharia law, shared commonly in Middle Eastern countries.
According to a Pew Research Study conducted last year, Muslims around the world are united by a belief in God, the Prophet Muhammad and the practice of religious rituals, like fasting during Ramadan.
Asked whether they want sharia law, a legal code based on the Koran and other Islamic scripture, the responses were varied — but not in the Middle East, where nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan and most in Iraq and Pakistan support sharia law as official law, the study showed.
“God is very straightforward about this — not we Muslims, not subjective, the Sharia is very clear about it, the punishment for homosexuality, bestiality or anything like that is death,” Muslim cleric Sheikh Khalid Yasin said in a YouTube video posted online. “We don't make any excuses about that, it's not our law — it's the Koran.”
In Saudi Arabia, lawmakers are looking to impose the death penalty on gay people who show their sexuality in public and on social media, according to reports. They claim social media has caused an uprise in the number of gays in their country. In Iran, in accordance with sharia law, men and women can be flogged for lesser acts such as kissing. In fact, in the Middle East, there are 10 countries where homosexuality may be punishable by law.
“What is [Islam's] judgment on sodomy and lesbianism?” said Ayatollah Ali Sistani, an influential Shiite sharia authority, when asked about the subject. “Forbidden. Those involved in the act should be punished. In fact, sodomites should be killed in the worst manner possible.”
Omar Mateen, the shooter responsible for the horrific attack in Orlando early Sunday morning, was the American-born son of immigrants from Afghanistan, where homosexuality may be punished by death.
An Islamic scholar who spoke earlier this year at an Orlando mosque has previously said gay people should be killed according to Islamic law “out of compassion.”
“Death is the sentence,” Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar said at a speech at the Husseini Islamic Center in Orlando in 2013. “We know. There's nothing to be embarrassed about this. Death is the sentence.”
“We have to have that compassion for people,” he continued. “With homosexuals, it's the same. Out of compassion, let's get rid of them now.”
There have been reports of U.S. liberal activists blaming Christians for Sunday's massacre.
“The Christian Right has introduced 200 anti-LGBT bills in the last six months, and people are blaming Islam for this. No,” Chase Strangio, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a Twitter post.
I'm sorry, Mr. Strangio — your line of thinking is moronic. It was not the Christian-right who radicalized Mr. Mateen.
Sally Kohn, an MSNBC contributor who is outspoken about LGBT rights, accused those who subscribe to traditional sexual mores of hypocrisy for condemning the murder of gay people.
“Always fascinating to watch conservatives who won't support basic non-discrimination laws bash Islamic fundamentalists for being anti-gay,” Ms. Kohn said on Twitter.
Ms. Kohn lacks an understanding in Christianity, where the sanctity of life is valued.
“At least fifty people — created in the image of God — were slaughtered in cold blood,” wrote Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.
“Let's call our congregations to pray together. Let's realize that, in this case, our gay and lesbian neighbors are likely quite scared. Who wouldn't be? Demonstrate the sacrificial love of Jesus to them,” Mr. Moore wrote.
“We don't have to agree on the meaning of marriage and sexuality to love one another and to see the murderous sin of terrorism,” he said.
Exactly right.
What happened in Orlando was a hate-crime driven by a fundamental belief in Muslim Sharia law.
Let's not pretend it was anything otherwise.

A couple months ago, my friend Dmitry Chaplinsky sent me an email telling me about a new library that I just had to checkout. Always curious about new computer vision and image processing packages, I became intrigued.
You see, Dmitry's work involves applying Python and OpenCV to tag and categorize shredded documents in hope of uncovering corruption in the in Ukraine. His library, unshred, does much of the dirty work.
But in order to build unshred he needed an easy way to debug OpenCV applications.
Just like we use print statements to debug simple Python apps, we use the OpenCV cv2.imshow and cv2.waitKey functions to visually display our images to our screen so that we can debug them.
In all honestly it's a real pain in the ass and before you know it, your pipeline is completely filled up with cv2.imshow calls.
To fix this cv2.imshow hell, Dmitry created visual-logging, a library that lets you debug and log your OpenCV pipeline directly to file. And it formats it all using a pretty HTML structure.
Before a few months ago, I had no idea that a tool like this even existed — and now I am incorporating it into my everyday computer vision workflow.
So if you're interested in how you can (better) debug and log your OpenCV + Python apps, then read on. You won't want to miss this awesome library.
Thanks again Dmitry!

OpenCV and Python versions:
This example will run on Python 2.7 and OpenCV 2.4.X/OpenCV 3.0+.
visual-logging, my new favorite tool for debugging OpenCV and Python apps
At the time of this writing, the visual-logging documentation claims that the package is pip -installable:
visual-logging, my new favorite tool for debugging OpenCV and Python apps $ pip install visual-logging 1 $ pip install visual - logging
However, when I executed the above command I got the dreaded “No distributions at all found for visual-logging”. I'm assuming that the package is not yet registered with PyPi.
Regardless, that's not a big deal. We can simply clone from the GitHub repo and install the “old-fashioned” way:
visual-logging, my new favorite tool for debugging OpenCV and Python apps (cv)annalee:VisualLogging adrianrosebrock$ git clone https://github.com/dchaplinsky/visual-logging.git Cloning into 'visual-logging'... remote: Counting objects: 137, done. remote: Total 137 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0) Receiving objects: 100% (137/137), 361.23 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.

( cv ) annalee : VisualLogging adrianrosebrock $ cd visual - logging / ( cv ) annalee : visual - logging adrianrosebrock $ python setup .py install
Now that we have visual-logging installed, let's create a simple script that demonstrates how visual-logging can be used to help us visualize our pipeline:
visual-logging, my new favorite tool for debugging OpenCV and Python apps # import the necessary packages from logging import FileHandler from vlogging import VisualRecord import logging import cv2 # open the logging file logger = logging.getLogger("visual_logging_example") fh = FileHandler("demo.html", mode = "w") # set the logger attributes logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) logger.addHandler(fh) # load our example image and convert it to grayscale image = cv2.imread("lex.jpg") image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # loop over some varying sigma sizes for s in xrange(3, 11, 2): # blur the image and detect edges blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (s, s), 0) edged = cv2.Canny(blurred, 75, 200) logger.debug(VisualRecord(("Detected edges using sigma = %d" % (s)), [blurred, edged], fmt = "png")) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 # import the necessary packages from logging import FileHandler from vlogging import VisualRecord import logging import cv2 # open the logging file logger = logging . getLogger ( "visual_logging_example" ) fh = FileHandler ( "demo.html" , mode = "w" ) # set the logger attributes logger . setLevel ( logging . DEBUG ) logger . addHandler ( fh ) # load our example image and convert it to grayscale image = cv2 . imread ( "lex.jpg" ) image = cv2 . cvtColor ( image , cv2 . COLOR_BGR2GRAY ) # loop over some varying sigma sizes for s in xrange ( 3 , 11 , 2 ) : # blur the image and detect edges blurred = cv2 . GaussianBlur ( image , ( s , s ) , 0 ) edged = cv2 . Canny ( blurred , 75 , 200 ) logger . debug ( VisualRecord ( ( "Detected edges using sigma = %d" % ( s ) ) , [ blurred , edged ] , fmt = "png" ) )
The code here is fairly simple. On Lines 2-5 we import the packages we'll need.
We then setup our logging handlers and attributes on Lines 8-13.
We load an example image of Lex Murphy (from Jurassic Park, duh) on Line 16 and convert the image to grayscale on Line 17.
Lines 20-25 test out our visual logger. We are going to progressively blur the image using a larger and larger sigma size. We then detect edges in the blurred image.
Normally, to view the output of our blurring and edge detection we would have to make a call to cv2.imshow and cv2.waitKey .
But those days are done.
Instead, we are going to create a VisualRecord and log both the Gaussian blurred and edged map to file. This will allow us to debug our pipeline and easily view our results.
Speaking of results, execute the following command to generate your visual log file:
visual-logging, my new favorite tool for debugging OpenCV and Python apps $ python visual_logging_example.py 1 $ python visual_logging_example .py
Assuming the script executed without error, you should have a new file named demo.html in your current working directory.
Here is a screenshot of what my demo.html file looks like:
As we can see from this example, as the size of the Gaussian sigma increases, the image becomes progressively more blurred. And as the image becomes more blurred, fewer edges are detected.
Of course, this is a fairly trivial example of debugging and logging an OpenCV + Python application. But I think you get the point — the days of clogging your code up with cv2.imshow and cv2.waitKey statements are gone!
Instead, just use visual-logging — your life will be much simpler.
Summary
In this blog post we explored visual-logging, my new favorite tool for debugging Python + OpenCV applications.
Up until now, debugging OpenCV apps has been a mess of cv2.imshow and cv2.waitKey calls. All of these functions calls are a pain in the ass to manage, and even worse for debugging. You'll be taking screenshot after screenshot of each iteration of your computer vision pipeline.
But now we have a better way. We can utilize Dmitry Chaplinsky's visual-logging package to help us easily debug and log our OpenCV apps.
Thanks Dmitry for such a great library!

The competition was predictably fierce at the third Los Angeles IPA Festival held at Mohawk Bend over the weekend, and the reigning champions were unseated by a local brewery further cementing its place as a darling of the craft beer scene in Los Angeles.
Highland Park Brewery's Bonkers IPA was awarded the first place prize by a panel of judges who smelled, sipped, and argued their way through the sixty-plus entries in this year's competition. The third place IPA, Lupulin River, came from Auburn, California's Knee Deep Brewing. Noble Ale Works, who'd captured the top prize at the first L.A. IPA Festival in 2013 with their Tongue Tickles IPA, and then achieved the unthinkable by repeating the victory during the second competition with I Love It! IPA, earned the second place award on Saturday with That's Umpossible.
UPDATE 3/15/16: I've added some information about the final round and how the beers scored after the jump.
Highland Park Brewery's co-founder and brewmaster Bob Kunz has developed a reputation with some wonderful hoppy beers that are mostly served over the bar at the Hermosillo on York Blvd. in HIghland park (his 480 square foot brewery is built into the backroom of the popular beer and wine bar). Bonkers IPA is a showcase of the popular Simcoe hop, and the grapefruit pith and earthy tropical character that the variety is prized for dominated the beer's aroma. The complex aroma is followed by a bright and clean flavor that finishes with a prickly, lingering bitterness. At 7% alcohol Bonkers IPA is not as potent as many of the competitors, and the judges were impressed by the clarity of hop flavor in the brew.
“It's pretty much the best result I could have hoped for,” said Evan Price, brewmaster at Noble Ale Works. Price and Kunz are close friends, and Price was visibly elated that one of his brewing mentors was honored at the festival. “If we'd won a third time people would really think that this competition was rigged,” he said, adding earnestly: “I'm stoked to get second place.”
The event demonstrates both the collaborative spirit prized by craft brewers, and their deep-seated competitive streaks. The judging happens over five hours and in several different rounds where the assembled brewers are broken into tables of four-to-five judges and presented with unlabeled flights of competitors. Each group is left to select what they believe is the best representation of “a modern Southern California IPA,” and the discussions at the tables can be as heated as it is technical. For this year's competition organizer Tony Yanow invited a handful of L.A.'s beer media to join the judging, and this writer was honored to be included in the event. Table talk during the first rounds of judging was jovial and irreverent, with plenty of shop-talk among the brewers along with bawdy commentary and inside jokes between the tight-knit community of brewers. As the day wore on, the conversations become more serious and focused (mostly), until the final round where each judged was tasked with selecting their top three brews from the flight of five final contenders.
In addition to the three awards decided by the panel of brewing professionals, guests at IPA Fest can vote on their favorite beers of the evening to decide the People's Choice award. Previous recipients of the populist honor were Societe Brewing's The Pupil in 2013 and Alpine Brewing Nelson IPA in 2014. (There was no LA IPA Festival held in 2015 as the event moved from December to March after the second year.) This year, the crowd honored a made-in-L.A. beer with the People's Choice award: Eagle Rock Brewery's The Winning Team IPA.
Eagle Rock Brewery founder Jeremy Raub says that the L.A. IPA Festival holds special significance because of not only who is judging the field, but also because there is no set definition for what the IPAs should taste like. “The community is deciding what the benchmark is,” he said. “Instead of picking the beauty queen of the day we are deciding on what defines exemplary IPA brewing.”
Bob Kunz said that taking top prize was “unreal,” and he was thrilled that so many brewers he admired had picked Bonkers as the best in show. Highland Park Brewery self distributed kegs of their beers to a scant few accounts in Los Angeles, making their brews a sought after commodity. They plan to release cans of their Hello L.A. IPA next month; the cans will only be available for purchase at the brewery and the Hermosillo bar.
Highland Park Brewery / The Hermosillo — 5125 York Blvd, Los Angeles — (323) 739-6459
UPDATE 3/15/16:
Festival organizer Tony Yanow sent all the judges a detailed breakdown of what beers were at each table during each round, and there were some interesting reveals once this info was correlated with my notes from the tasting.
The Final Table: You know that the top three beers were HPB, Noble, and Knee Deep, but the other two brews to advance to the final table were Wolf Creek's Single Hop Mosaic Lone Wolf (in 4th place) and Claremont Craft Ales' Single Dude (in 5th place). The final scoring was tallied by each judge picking their top three beers, with the number one pick scoring 5 points, 3 points going to their second place pick, and a single point given to the third pick. HPB's Bonkers scored 62 points at the final table, while Noble's entry score 40 (barely securing second place over Knee Deep's 39 points).
Bonkers was the clear winner, and every judge except for one picked it in their top three (and nearly a third of the judges picking it as their best in show). The HPB IPA also knocked off beers from Strand Brewing, Sierra Nevada, and Speakeasy Brewing at the first table before getting maybe the toughest second table flight in the competition going against Faction's Hop Solid and Russian River's Pliny the Elder. I was actually at that final table, and the conversation over those three beers was lively to say the least; Bonkers barely squeaked by Pliny the Elder to make the finals.
Ottawa's first permanent bitcoin ATM was unveiled in a Byward Market pub on Thursday.
The digital currency isn't in actual coins, but can be bought or traded on the internet and converted into real dollars.
As of Tuesday, one bitcoin was valued at about US$860.
The first bitcoin kiosk in Ottawa was being installed Wednesday at the Clocktower Brew Pub on Clarence Avenue. The ATM was made by Ottawa-based BitAccess, with help from Bit-Capital.
"We're pretty excited about it," said Ryan Wallace, BitAccess's CEO. "It's taken off explosively in the past couple of years. I think 2014 is going to be the year it goes mainstream and becomes a public name."
Turns cash into bitcoins, bitcoins into cash
Using a mobile phone app, people can put cash into the kiosk. The machine then sends the bitcoin equivalent to the user's mobile bitcoin wallet.
The kiosk can also turn bitcoins into cash.
People can purchase up to $10,000 worth of bitcoin daily.
Wallace expects merchants, including the Clocktower Pub, will start allowing bitcoin transactions.
"It's very simple. We have another app that they, the merchant, can use. They can accept bitcoin and it'll pay back to their account in Canadian dollars," Wallace said.
Bitcoin users like it because it's not regulated and there are no bank fees. Others call the bitcoin an imaginary currency and a passing trend. Some are worried about the volatility of the value of the coin.
David Descoteaux is a researcher with the Montreal Economic Institute. He said he appreciates the bitcoin's innovation but that it will eventually demand regulation.
"Maybe if bitcoins were subjected to consumer protection law, maybe that would strengthen the confidence of a lot of people who want to try it but right now are kind of wary of what could happen if there's a problem," Descoteaux said.
"If there could be some clear guidance or some regulatory framework, I think it would be more certain for everyone. ... There is a certain part of people who are very enthusiastic about bitcoin, who are kind of libertarians who want to change the financial system. So it may be ironic, for some, but I personally believe that bitcoin will profit from some kind of government acceptance."
BitAccess's Wallace, meanwhile, said another of the company's ATMs will be installed in Toronto soon, and that it has orders for more in Alberta and elsewhere.
A golden retriever waits to be scanned. (Eniko Kubinyi)
In a study published this week in Science and devoured by dog lovers worldwide, researchers at the Family Dog Project in Hungary concluded that pooches can understand the meaning and tone of human speech and that they process language in the same way humans do. To figure this out, the scientists analyzed scans of dogs' brain activity when hearing words. And to get those scans, they needed their subjects — 13 family pets — to lie completely motionless in an fMRI scanner for eight whole minutes while wearing earphones and a radiofrequency coil on their heads.
Come again?
[Your dog really does know what you're saying, and a brain scan shows how]
Several readers wondered how on Earth this is possible. What sort of dog magician made this happen? The answer is Marta Gacsi, an ethologist at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, co-author of the study and longtime researcher of man's best friend. She was the head trainer of the dogs — six border collies, five golden retrievers, a German shepherd and a Chinese crested. We spoke to her about how she got them to cooperate.
This interview has been edited for space and clarity.
These Hungarian dogs were trained to sit motionless in an fMRI scanner for the sake of science. (Eniko Kubiyi)
The dogs
Most of them were really young. Some of them were trained assistance dogs for disabled people; they need a dog that is eager to please, so that's what we needed here. But we also had very, very untrained dogs. We had dogs that could only sit down and stay. It's not really an important thing to be well-trained to be successful in this thing.
We need dogs that trust the owner. As in the case of a child [in an MRI exam], you say, maybe you won't see me, but I will be there. Some were trained by me and handled by me. And it was okay, because the dog trusted me. That was a very important prerequisite of the task.
At the beginning, it seemed logical that we needed highly trained dogs with a calm temperament. None of these hypotheses turned out to be true. There were many trained dogs that turned out to be perfect and some highly trained dogs that failed, because they wanted to do something. They wanted to do their best, but they couldn't understand that here the task is doing nothing. Usually these dogs were trained using many treats. When they couldn't get their treat in half a minute or so, then they were frustrated and we couldn't use them. Some other dogs didn't understand that they were required to stay absolutely motionless. They always moved a little bit or they licked their mouth every third minute. And that's enough to ruin the whole test.
[What does a dog want more — ‘good boy' or treats?]
[Successfully trained dogs], you can see in their eyes when a drop of water falls on their noses and they know, ‘I cannot lick it.' It's really … I don't know what to say. They are not forced. They are asked. You can't imagine how happy they are at the end. They bounce to the others like, ‘Okay, I did it! I did it!' We are really seeing that they are proud.
The dogs were trained to sit in an fMRI using social rewards and food. (Borbala Ferenczy)
The method
We didn't want to work with normal trainers, because, at least in Hungary, there are two different lines. The traditional way, they use too much punishment. The other way is based on positive reinforcement. That means treats — food, food, food, and nothing else. And that wouldn't work in the scanner. We base our training on ethological research. So it's a little bit different than normal training like obedience or Schutzhund. It's rather like you want to persuade your child, your 5-year-old little one, to spend a minute motionless in the scanner. How would you do it? That was the major thing. It wasn't, how would you train an animal? We shouldn't handle them as infants, but we definitely shouldn't handle them as wolves. They are dogs, and that's a very special thing. So we use social learning and, of course, we use food rewards as well.
The first part was lying on the floor with the head between the paws. Then the same on the table, motionless. Then the same while the table is moving a little bit. And then the same wearing earphones, and their head is gently tied with some cloth. That's to make them feel that something is on their head. But it was never fixed. That's a very crucial point of the training, that dogs could always at every second leave the position and the place if they wanted to do so.
Because of our method, the real problem we had is that when we opened the door to the MRI scanner room, all the dogs wanted to rush in. The scanner is extremely noisy. It's not fun to be there. Try to explain to your grandma why it is good to be in a disco. It's very noisy, it smells like hell, there are too many people. It doesn't make sense, and people even pay for it! It's social learning. When you were a child, you could see that all the young adults love to go there, so you want to be there. You want to be part of the party. That's what we wanted to do with the dogs, so we always had a big party in the scanner room. The dogs that were placed on the scanner, we praised them. All the little ones, all the novice dogs, they wanted to be there. They didn't know why, but they wanted to be there. Even the owners of the [dogs in training] praised and petted the [already] trained dog on the scanner bed. So that dog was the focus, and we ignored the other ones. Everybody wanted to be the focus, they wanted to be praised, they wanted to be rewarded.
This is the model-rival training method. Some dogs acted partly as a model for the other dogs, showing what to do and where to be. And also as a rival – all the attention went toward this dog. That's a social thing. It's not about cheese or treats. Its about being socially involved in the social interaction with the owners. A good dog wants to be part of this.
This golden retriever was trained to wear earphones and a radiofrequency coil, and to lie motionless for 7minutes in an fMRI scanner. (Attila D. Molnar, filmjungle.eu)
How long it took
There were dogs that could only come to the lab once in a month. So that's not a really efficient training, but we could do it. We needed to ask the owners to please come to the scanner on Sunday night. That's when we had access, because otherwise it's used for medical purposes for humans.
Usually the basic training, not with the scanner, that would need from five to 20 sessions. It depends on the dog. And training at the scanner, usually about 10 sessions. At the beginning we always used the dogs together for motivation and, of course, we used food reward as well. But we had to be very cautious, because we couldn't give them treats during the test. So that's at least eight minutes without any reward. And they even couldn't expect food, because of drooling! If they drool, they lick their mouth and swallow, and that's it. So they couldn't even think of getting a food reward during the scan. So we had to explain to them that it's a very long story, and at the end you will have a lot of very good food — but only at the end.
My major focus in this respect is to work out methods based on social learning techniques, instead of using this continuous food reward. Positive reinforcement-based methods are really nice compared to the punishment-based methods, but it seems that we tend to forget about social aspects. Positive reinforcement can be anything, like praise and social rewards. So we use our scientific experience. And we try to run experiments that would give some insights to the applied field as well, for trainers. Because there are so many training theories, but they don't really have data. All of them have experience, and that's good and nice, but it's very difficult to tell what's really the truth.

You may or may not have heard that Ruger unveiled a much desired Mark IV pistol recently. It mends the number one problem that has plagued many Ruger shooters over the years. You now can field strip the pistol without the need of watching several YouTube tutorials. With the simple push of a button, you can “pop the hood” on the Ruger Mark IV for easy cleaning and troubleshooting. Now that this heavily-requested Mark IV is on the market the Mark III is no longer needed. At least that is what Ruger is quietly saying on their website.
If you are on the Ruger website you can navigate through a few pages and see for yourself. On their homepage, you can click on their Menu and select Customer Service. On the new page you can select Serial Number History and Instruction Manuals. Finally, you can select Pistol Instruction Manuals & Product History. There you can see that all of the variations of the Mark III are “Out of Production” as of 2016.
What this basically means is whatever Mark III pistols that are still left at distributors and gun shops are it. If you really want a Mark III before they are gone, your time is limited. An image of what you will find on Ruger's website can be seen below.
A lot of people have speculated as to why Ruger finally made an easier to dis-assemble rimfire pistol. The best conspiracy theory without getting an official statement from Ruger is the Smith & Wesson SW22 Victory prompted Ruger to create the Mark IV. With the easy takedown on the Victory many people believe the new Mark IV is Ruger's response to compete.
So for now you may not own a collector item, but in 30 years, who knows. Hang onto your Ruger Mark III pistols and you might have something pretty desirable!
Two things you need to know about Hillary Clinton; she dodged sniper fire in Bosnia, and is not President today because of Macedonians.
Except her in-house TV news network disagrees about the latter:
Hillary Clinton's list of who's to blame for her 2016 election loss gets longer with every passing day. On Wednesday, in an interview with Recode's Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, Clinton added a few more names to her list: The New York Times and the Democratic National Committee. That's in addition to the media, James Comey, Donald Trump, the Russians and her supporters' assumptions that she would win the race. The one person missing from that list? Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Ouch!
Disappointed, mad and hurt, CNN rips in further (no doubt through big, fat tears):
It's hardly “news” at this point to report that the nation's banks have recovered strongly from the financial crisis, but the results for last year provided even more evidence:
· Profits for the year hit $154.7 billion, according to reports filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That is the highest level ever.
· Only 24 banks failed last year, the fewest since 2007.
· In December, the nation got its first new bank in nearly four years when the colorfully named Bank of Bird-in-Hand opened its doors in Lancaster County, Pa.
· Lending continued to grow, up 3 percent last year. However, at $7.79 trillion, bank loans remain below the peak of $7.85 trillion they reached in June of 2008.
· Banks even increased the amount they lent for construction and land development, the first time that had happened since 2008. (On the other hand, total loans in this category are less than a third of the level they reached at the end of 2007.)
· The FDIC said it had 467 banks on its problem list. At the end of 2010 there were 884 banks on that list. The agency does not identify those banks.
· The Investigative Reporting Workshop now lists just 126 banks with more nonperforming assets than capital, down from a peak of 411 in March of 2010.
All of that is in stark contrast to the conditions in the banking industry when we launched Banktracker five years ago this month.
As we reported then, the main culprit was the real estate collapse that produced startling amounts of bad loans and led to foreclosure levels not seen since the Great Depression.
Troubled assets — a combination of nonperforming loans and repossessed property — amounted to $151.8 billion at the end of December. At the height of the crisis, in March 2010, troubled assets were $382.1 billion. It might be noted, though, that troubled assets were just $109 billion at the end of 2007.
CLOSE A new OECD report lists the most educated countries. Doug McIntyre explains the differences between them.
In 2011, more than $26,000 was spent on tertiary education per student in the U.S. (Photo: Thinkstock)
More people access higher education today than ever before. One in three adults in developed countries held a college degree in 2012, a substantial increase from 2000 when just over one in five had attained such qualifications.
According to data recently released by the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD), more than half of Russian adults held tertiary degrees in 2012 — the equivalent of college degree in the United States — more than in any other country reviewed. Meanwhile, less than 4% of Chinese adults had tertiary qualifications in 2012, less than in any other country. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 countries with the highest proportion of adults holding a college degree.
The most educated populations tend to be in countries where tertiary education spending is among the highest. Tertiary education spending in six of the most educated countries was higher than the OECD average of $13,957. Spending on tertiary education in the U.S., for example, was $26,021 per student, by far the most in the world.
According to Andreas Schleicher, director for education skills at the OECD, education in the U.S. has become much more expensive, and student debt burdens have reached troubling levels in recent years. Despite these facts, it is still considered a good investment, as U.S. residents with higher degrees earn substantially more than their less educated peers.
It is also a worthwhile investment for the government. Schleicher explained that "taxpayers in the U.S. get $200,000 more out of every graduate than what they actually invested, so it's a good business for the government as well."
Despite the value of investing in education, there are exceptions. Korea and the Russian Federation both spent less than $10,000 on tertiary education per student in 2011, considerably lower than the OECD average. Yet, they still have among the most educated populations.
Qualifications do not always translate into stronger skills. While only 1 in 4 of U.S. college graduates reach the top-end of literacy skill, more than 35% reach that level in Finland, Japan, and the Netherlands. As Schleicher explained, "We typically describe people by their formal qualifications, but this data suggests that the skill value of formal qualifications vary considerably across countries."
Nevertheless, countries with strong higher education systems tend to have higher levels of advanced skills. Roughly 12% of adults across the OECD performed at the highest literacy proficiency level in 2012. The percentage of adults performing at the highest literacy level exceeded that figure in five of the most educated countries.
Those higher skills may be paying off for residents. Only Ireland had an unemployment rate higher than the OECD rate of 7.5% in 2012. According to Schleicher, this relationship may also work the other way around because those who are employed are far more likely to pursue higher education and training. Unfortunately, this means "those who need life-long learning the most actually get the least out of it."

To identify the most educated countries in the world, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 countries with the highest proportions of residents aged 25 to 64 with a tertiary education in 2012. These data were included as part of the OECD's 2014 Education at a Glance report. The countries considered included the 34 OECD member countries, and ten non-OECD nations. Included in the report were data on the proportion of adults completing various levels of education, unemployment rates, as well as public and private education expenditure. We also reviewed data from the OECD's Survey of Adult Skills, which included advanced adult proficiency in both math and reading. The most current figures for education expenditure by country are from 2011.
These are the most educated countries in the world.
1) Russian Federation
> Pct. population with tertiary education: 53.5%
> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): N/A
> Tertiary education spending per student: $7,424 (the lowest)
More than 53% of Russian adults between the ages of 25 and 64 had some form of higher education in 2012, more than in any other country reviewed by the OECD. The country has reached this exceptional level of attainment despite spending among the least on tertiary education. Russia's tertiary education expenditure was just $7,424 per student in 2010, roughly half the OECD average of $13,957. Russia was also one of just a few countries where education spending declined between 2008 and 2012.

2) Canada
> Pct. population with tertiary education: 52.6%
> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 2.3% (8th lowest)
> Tertiary education spending per student: $23,225 (2nd highest)
More than half of Canadian adults had received tertiary qualification in 2012, the only country other than Russia where a majority of adults had some form of higher education. Canada's education expenditure of $23,226 per student in 2011 trailed only the United States' expenditure. Canadian students of all ages appear to be very well-educated. Secondary school students outperformed the majority of countries in mathematics on the PISA in 2012. And nearly 15% of adults in the country performed at the highest level of literacy proficiency, versus an OECD average of 12%.

3) Japan
> Pct. population with tertiary education: 46.6%
> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 2.8% (12th lowest)
> Tertiary education spending per student: $16,445 (10th highest)
Like the U.S., Korea, and the United Kingdom, private spending accounts for the vast majority of spending on tertiary education in Japan. While this can often lead to social inequalities, Schleicher explained that like most Asian countries, Japanese families are by and large willing to save money for their children's educations. Strong education spending and participation in higher education does not necessarily translate to higher academic skills. In Japan, however, higher spending did lead to better learning outcomes, as more than 23% of adults performed at the highest level of literacy proficiency, nearly double the OECD average of 12%. Younger students also seem to be well-educated, as Japan reported exceptionally high Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores in mathematics in 2012.

4) Israel
> Pct. population with tertiary education: 46.4%
> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): N/A
> Tertiary education spending per student: $11,553 (18th highest)
Most 18-year old Israelis are subject to at least two years of mandatory military service. Perhaps as a result, country residents tend to complete higher education degrees later in life than in other countries. The compulsory conscription, however, has not lowered educational attainment rates, as 46% of Israeli adults had attained tertiary qualification in 2012. More than $11,500 was spent per student on tertiary education in 2011, lower than most other developed countries. Low education spending in Israel has resulted in low teacher salaries. New secondary teacher hires with minimum training were paid less than $19,000 in 2013, versus an OECD average of more than $32,000.
5) United States
> Pct. population with tertiary education: 43.1%
> Average annual growth rate (2000-2011): 1.4% (the lowest)
> Tertiary education spending per student: $26,021 (the highest)
In 2011, more than $26,000 was spent on tertiary education per student in the U.S., nearly double the OECD average of $13,957. Private expenditure in the form of tuition fees accounted for the majority of this spending. High education expenditures have paid off to some degree, as a large proportion of U.S. adults have very high levels of qualification. Because of the slow growth rates of the past decade, however, the U.S. has slipped behind many other nations. While spending per tertiary student between 2005 and 2011 increased by 10% across OECD countries on average, U.S. spending decreased over that time. And the U.S. was one of only six countries to cut public education spending between 2008 and 2011. Like other countries where education is controlled by regional authorities, tertiary attainment levels vary widely in the United States, from as little as 29% in Nevada, to as much as 71% in the District of Columbia.

Back in the early days of AWS, I would often receive questions that boiled down to “This sounds really interesting, but what about security?”
We created the AWS Security & Compliance Center to publish information about the various reports, certifications, and independent attestations that we've earned and to provide you with additional information about the security features that we've built in to AWS including Identity and Access Management, Multi-Factor Authentication, Key Rotation, support for server-side and client-side encryption in Amazon S3, and SSL support in the Elastic Load Balancer. The Security & Compliance Center is also home to the AWS Risk and Compliance White Paper and the AWS Overview of Security Processes.
Today we are adding another powerful security option, the AWS CloudHSM service. While the items listed above are more than adequate in most situations, some of our customers are in situations where contractual or regulatory needs mandate additional protection for their keys. The CloudHSM service helps these customers to meet strict requirements for key management without sacrificing application performance.
What is an HSM and What Does it Do?
HSM is short for Hardware Security Module. It is a piece of hardware — a dedicated appliance that provides secure key storage and a set of cryptographic operations within a tamper-resistant enclosure. You can store your keys within an HSM and use them to encrypt and decrypt data while keeping them safe and sound and under your full control. You are the only one with access to the keys stored in an HSM.
The AWS CloudHSM Service
The AWS CloudHSM service brings the benefits of HSMs to the cloud. You retain full control of the keys and the cryptographic operations performed by the HSM(s) you create, including exclusive, single-tenant access to each one. Your cryptographic keys are protected by a tamper-resistant HSM that is designed to meet a number of international and US Government standards including NIST FIPS 140-2 and Common Criteria EAL4+.
Each of your CloudHSMs has an IP address within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You'll receive administrator credentials for the appliance, allowing you to create and manage cryptographic keys, create user accounts, and perform cryptographic operations using those accounts. We do not have access to your keys; they remain under your control at all times. In Luna SA terminology, we have Admin credentials and you have both HSM Admin and HSM Partition Owner credentials.
AWS CloudHSM is now available in multiple Availability Zones in the US East (Northern Virginia) and EU West (Ireland) Regions. We'll be making them available in other Regions throughout 2013 based on customer demand.
Inside the AWS CloudHSM
We are currently providing the Luna SA HSM appliance from SafeNet, Inc. The appliances run version 5 of the Luna SA software.
Once your AWS CloudHSM is provisioned, you can access it through a number of standard APIs including PCKS #11 (Cryptographic Token Interface Standard), the Microsoft Cryptography API (CAPI), and the Java JCA/JCE (Java Cryptography Architecture / Java Cryptography Extensions). The Luna SA client provides these APIs to your applications and implements each call by connecting to your CloudHSM using a mutually authenticated SSL connection. If you have existing applications that run on top of these APIs, you can use them with CloudHSM in short order.
Getting Started
The CloudHSM service is available today in the US-East and EU-West regions. You'll pay an one-time upfront fee (currently $5,000 per HSM), an hourly rate (currently $1.88 per hour or $1,373 per month on average for CloudHSM service in the US-East region). Consult the CloudHSM pricing page for more info.
To get started with CloudHSM or to learn more, contact us. You can also schedule a short trial period using the same link.
In most cases we can satisfy requests for one or two CloudHSMs per customer within a few business days. Requests for more than two may take several weeks.
Learn More
To learn more about CloudHSM, read the CloudHSM FAQ, the CloudHSM Getting Started Guide, and the CloudHSM Home Page.
— Jeff;
The Internet has become a powerful platform for individuals to access information and exchange opinions and ideas of all kinds. It also contributes billions of dollars annually to the US economy. This is due in significant part to a legal structure that protects the intermediaries that make up the Internet – including the third-party content hosts, user-generated content platforms, and advertising networks – from being held legally liable for the content that their users post. 47 USC § 230 provides these intermediaries with crucial certainty that they will not be taken to court for disputes over material that their users choose to publish through their services. Without such legal protection, the risk of potential liability would prevent content hosts from being able to offer people the ability to share information, opinions, and creative expression online.
The SAVE Act introduced by Senators Kirk and Feinstein would radically undermine this certainty by creating potential federal criminal liability for intermediaries who host user-provided content that is designed to facilitate a criminal child-trafficking venture, and placing burdensome recordkeeping requirements on any intermediary that hosts a wide range of “adult” content.
The new offense, described in section (b) of the bill, raises a number of concerns:
The definition of “adult advertising” is broad and includes lawful advertising for lawful adult-oriented services, as well as communications that are not explicitly advertisements but that are designed in part to induce lawful commercial exchange. Intermediaries who host users' content will be faced with a wide and difficult-to-define range of content that may pull them into the bill's criminal liability provisions.
The offense is aimed at operators of websites[1] that knowingly host adult advertising and “recklessly disregard” the fact that it is designed to facilitate federal child trafficking or state child exploitation crimes. A “reckless disregard” standard means that a website operator could be held criminally liable for content created by a third party, even if the operator did not know that the content was intended to further a crime. This new potential for liability would present a radical change for operators and would have a number of unintended consequences: Operators of online classified ad sites would have a strong disincentive to create categories for “adult” ads or to do any sort of pre-screening of user-uploaded content, in order to avoid obtaining knowledge that they are hosting adult advertising. Operators of any type commercially oriented site – online advertising websites, but also marketplaces such as EBay and Amazon – would be likely to take down any content that is reported to them as being an “adult advertisement”, rather than risk prosecution for continuing to host flagged content with “reckless disregard” to its potentially unlawful nature. This would essentially result in a de facto notice-and-takedown regime for adult content, and would create a potentially powerful heckler's veto mechanism for individuals seeking to suppress other users' speech.
In addition to the new federal criminal offense, the SAVE Act would introduce a set of recordkeeping requirements for an incredibly broad range of entities, posing significant problems under the First Amendment. Although styled in paragraph (b)(3)(B) as a safe harbor from the liability for the new offense, section (c) is in fact a broad and burdensome regulation of protected speech. It applies to a wide range of content and intermediaries, and there is a significant minimum penalty for failure to comply.
Section (c) requires any person who maintains or is paid to distribute or publish an adult advertisement to collect government-issued photo identification from any person who places an adult advertisement, to keep these records for a minimum of seven years, and to provide these records to federal and state officials upon request.
There is essentially no limit to what could constitute an adult advertisement and trigger the recordkeeping requirement. For example, if an adult performer were to use a social networking site to promote his services, the operator of the site would be required to collect his identifying information, regardless of whether the content appeared as a paid advertisement or through regular use of the service, such as through a tweet or status update.
Importantly, there is no mens rea requirement for the maintenance or distribution of adult advertisements, meaning that the entire universe of user-generated content platforms, social media sites, and advertising services that accept content developed by third parties may potentially be maintainers or distributors of adult advertising, whether or not they intend to be.
The bill's penalty for failure to maintain the required identification records is a minimum fine of $250,000 or up to 5 years in prison. This is a heavy incentive for content platforms and third-party hosts to obtain identifying information from every individual whose content they host. Even if the platform has no intent to host adult advertising content, the penalty for error is steep, and could prove ruinous to smaller publishers, website operators, and other content hosts.
Even if the identification requirements were applied only to individuals uploading clearly identified adult advertising content, the identification requirements threaten to chill adults' protected speech. The bill's definition of adult advertising includes lawful ads for lawful services, and covers communications that are only in part intended to induce commercial exchange (i.e., are not communications wholly devoted to advertising). Thus, the bill would still require the provision of significant amounts of personal information from adults engaged in constitutionally protected communications; similar identification requirements in the Child Online Protection Act led to that law being struck down due, in part, to the burden these requirements place on speakers, listeners, and hosts of protected speech. ACLU v Mukasey, 534 F.3d 181 (3rd Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 137 (2009).
Subsection (c)(5) also directs the Attorney General to promulgate a number of additional regulations that burden First Amendment rights:
(c)(5)(A) requires all operators of user-generated content platforms and third-party content hosts to manually review all content before it is posted. This is a burden that few, if any, operators and hosts could survive. Attempts to comply with this law will dramatically reduce the opportunities for speakers to find willing hosts and platforms for their speech online.
(c)(5)(B) directs the Attorney General to develop a blacklist of words that individuals are prohibited from using even in lawful advertisements for lawful goods and services . Such a regulation would fail even the slightest level of scrutiny, let alone the heightened scrutiny required by the First Amendment.
. Such a regulation would fail even the slightest level of scrutiny, let alone the heightened scrutiny required by the First Amendment. (c)(5)(C) would require operators of user-generated content sites to engage in active monitoring of all content – a significant time- and resource-intensive process – to ensure previously removed content is not reposted. This will require operators to maintain thorough records of all material removed and their reasons for removing it, significantly adding to the costs of operating a user-generated content site.
Further, (c)(5)(C) would require operators to adopt policies of prohibiting people who had previously posted “inappropriate” content from being able to post content in the future, essentially deputizing website operators to enact unconstitutional prior restraints on individuals' speech.
The Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), an organisation working for Muslim women empowerment, has written a letter to the prime minister to codify the Muslim Personal Law as per a draft prepared by them and make certain prevalent practices illegal.
These include making illegal unilateral oral triple talaq, polygamy, (halala) compulsory marriage of women with another person if she intends to re-unite with divorced husband, and temporary marriage contract (Muta). Their draft seeks a law based on Quranic tenets concerning age of marriage, mehr, talaq, polygamy, maintenance and custody of children among other things.
The letter states, "Certain orthodox and patriarchal males have dominated the debate on rights of Muslim women and have stonewalled any attempt towards reform in Muslim Personal Law."
It goes on to agree with the recent Supreme Court observation and question asked to National Legal Services Authority of India if gender discrimination suffered by Muslim women should not be considered as a violation of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15 and 21.
Citing their study and agreeing with observations made by SC judges, the letter added, "Justice for Indian Muslim women can be enabled either through amendments to the Shariat Application Act, 1937, as well as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, or a completely new enactment of Muslim Personal Law."
"What we need is codification of law. Those who say that codification has happened do not know what codification means," said Noorjehan Safia Niaz, co-founder of BMMA. When asked about apprehensions and reservations sounded out due to a "right wing" government at Centre, she added, "It is a democratically elected government, even if it's right wing. All these years we have been talking to them (ulemas) and, despite creating so much noise, they have not done anything. We want a codified, Quran-compliant law. In this way, at least people do not get the opportunity to talk about the uniform civil code."
Chester, a seven-month-old Scottish Fold kitten who was lost by Air Canada at the Montreal airport last month, has been found safe and sound — if a little skinny.
Chester the cat has been lost for nearly a month. Owner Amanda Stewart kept a Facebook page and organized searchers in Montreal's West Island from her home in Surrey, B.C. (Amanda Stewart/Facebook)
Owner Amanda Stewart, who lives in Surrey, B.C., posted a picture of Chester to Facebook on Wednesday along with the comments: "Omg omg omg" and "Hi everyone ITS BEEN CONFIRMED CHESTER HAS BEEN FOUND ALIVE. He is on his way to the vets right now."
Stewart confirmed to CBC News that Chester had been found by a woman, also named Amanda, who works at the Montreal-Trudeau airport where Chester was lost.
"I'm happy. I'm just hoping that he's OK right now. That he's healthy," Stewart told CBC News. "He seems to be skinny."
Isabelle Arthur, a spokeswoman for Air Canada, said the airline was advised by the Montreal Airport Authority team this morning that Chester had been located.
"They subsequently delivered him to our cargo team. As soon as we confirmed it was Chester, we advised his owner. Chester is now at a local veterinarian for a full checkup," Arthur said.
She said Air Canada was making arrangements to reunite Stewart and Chester as soon as possible and will pay for all the expenses.
"We will be taking care of everything, including reuniting Chester with his owner," Arthur said.
Stewart had bought Chester from a Quebec breeder for $1,200 more than a month ago. However, the cat managed to escape from its airline-approved cat carrier on May 21 while at the Montreal airport en route to Vancouver.
Owner looked to Facebook for help
Stewart had set up a Facebook page to help co-ordinate searchers in Montreal. Just yesterday, she posted a message that said Chester had been gone so long that it wasn't looking good. "He should have been seen by now," she wrote.
I don't want him in cargo at all. - Amanda Stewart
"I had great amounts of awesome people just looking in the neighbourhoods for me. He wasn't found in the neighbourhoods though, he was actually found inside the airport fence — along the fence is what I got — and he was spotted and then trapped this morning," she said from Surrey, B.C.
Chester is at a veterinary clinic and while skinny, he's eating and drinking. (Amanda Stewart/Facebook) Now Chester is at the vet getting a checkup, accompanied by an Air Canada employee who had been helping Stewart on her own time. Stewart said Chester weighs just five pounds, but is eating and drinking.
She said she hopes to get him back soon, but wants to make sure he's in good shape before putting him on a plane.
Air Canada could have done more: owner
Stewart told CBC News that while she's very happy that Chester was found, she is still upset with what she said was a lack of communication from the airline to the rest of the airport.
She said Air Canada could have done more to co-ordinate search efforts.
To get him back home, Stewart said she hopes that at the very least, Air Canada will allow Chester inside the cabin instead of putting him in cargo. Ideally, she said, they'd pay to have her husband fly to Montreal to collect the cat.
"I don't want him in cargo at all."
BOSTON (Reuters) - A Massachusetts hedge fund manager has been arrested and accused of misappropriating millions of dollars from investors and engaging in a Ponzi-like scheme, U.S. authorities said.
Yasuna Murakami, who managed Cambridge, Massachusetts-based MC2 Capital Management LLC, was arrested in Vermont on Saturday and charged in a criminal complaint with wire fraud, according to papers unsealed in federal court in Boston on Monday.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related lawsuit against Murakami and Avi Chiat, his partner at MC2, and their firm, accusing them of defrauding investors about the funds' performance after raising $15 million.
The SEC said that since 2008, Murakami, 44, also stole more than $8 million invested with him, and used an additional $1.3 million to make Ponzi-like payments to earlier investors by misappropriating funds from later ones.
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin brought an administrative action in January against Murakami for operating a Ponzi scheme.
Murakami was arrested in Vermont on Saturday as he crossed back into the United States from Canada, a spokeswoman for Acting U.S. Attorney William Weinreb in Boston said.
Lawyers for Murakami and Chiat did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
According to the criminal complaint, Murakami schemed to defraud investors in a hedge fund he set up in 2011 that allowed U.S. investors to gain exposure to a fund overseen by Toronto-based Donville Kent Asset Management.
After soliciting money from investors for MC2 Capital Canadian Opportunities Fund, Murakami misused investments for personal expenses like international travel, student loan payments and high-end department stores, the complaint said.
He also used investor funds to make personal investments in the MC2 Canadian fund and to pay for a black Nissan GT-R sports car, according to the complaint.
Murakami additionally used money in the Canadian fund to make payments to investors in two other MC2 hedge funds, from which he had earlier misappropriated money, according the complaint and the SEC.
Chiat meanwhile misled investors about facts that suggested Murakami was misappropriating their money or that he had used the Canadian fund's money to make Ponzi-like payments to investors in the two other hedge funds, the SEC said.
In total, more than 50 investors were defrauded, the SEC said.
The cases in the U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. Murakami, No. 17-mj-06119, and Securities and Exchange Commission v. Murakami, et al, No. 17-cv-10928.
The author does not speak Chinese, so the following analysis is lacking a lot of good information the author would like to have. For instance, at the outset, we are unsure as to whether the ICO has already finished or will finish tomorrow, August 15th. We know they originally wanted their second round to begin on July 5th but then later posted a notice to their page:
We were not tipped off about the ICO until the end of last week, via Twitter[]. From there, we've had little luck finding out much more information besides the one English language whitepaper. There may still be an opportunity here, so we will look over it. After all, people who apparently do speak Chinese have contributed over $1.7 million in Ethereum so far.
As such, we will try to avoid being providing an authoritative analysis here, and instead provide the information we were able to acquire and then a numerical rating based on that. This is not a typical analysis for us because this is not a typical ICO for us.
Built on NEO
NEO, formerly Antshares, can be best described as the Chinese answer to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. While there are plenty of Satoshi-based coins that take on a Chinese-specific tone, none have really made waves in the same way that NEO has over the past several months, since its rebranding. News such as the Chinese government collecting taxes via the blockchain [] seems to translate to price rises for the platform. Here's a peek at recent activity for NEO:
The High Performance Blockchain (HPB) uses NEO in the same way that Aragon and other ICOs we have seen on Ethereum use Ethereum: for its blockchain and token issuance. Beyond that, it is its own software.
Problem HPB Is Solving?
The High Performance Blockchain seeks to make blockchain integration for real-world businesses easier through the introduction of an application programming interface. While this is the idea of NEO at its core, in the same way that Aragon seeks to make Ethereum integration easier, HPB can make NEO integration easier.
This is achieved by creating an architecture similar to an API operating system. The software architecture provides accounts, identity and authorization management, policy management, databases, and asynchronous communication on thousands of CPUs, FPGAs or clustered program schedulers. This blockchain is a new architecture that can support millions of transactions per second andsupport authorizations within seconds.
In doing this, HPB is using the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. This is the mechanism used by Bitshares and others which changes the way that rewards are done in a proo of stake system. In a traditional proof of stake system, the more coins one has, the more weight one has, and therefore the higher one's odds of “minting” new blocks. In a delegated proof of stake system, blocks can be minted regardless of existent weights, reputation systems are used, and a trusted panel of holders must be established. Real-time voting is also used. For an overview, see here.
The HPB team claim to have worked closely with Chinese mega firm UnionPay to design their system, which will have 3 second blocks. Blocks this fast would be nearly impossible in a proof-of-work system. However, a highly-efficient, highly-available blockchain like this will have a great degree of utility as more and more of the world comes online and needs to interact with global finance networks, often enough without local legacy financial partners to work through. Even if it were a strict clone of Aragon with translations and localizations integrated for the Asian markets, HPB would have some value in this respect.
What is unclear is what the HPB token, NEO, and the HPB blockchain will do in concert with each other. We gather that the token itself will be issued on the NEO blockchain. We gather that the HPB token will be used for businesses to interact with the HPB ecosystem, which we understand will be a delegated proof-of-stake system that is independently mined of the NEO shares blockchain. We understand that HPB is designed to specifications provided by UnionPay.
HPB Use Cases
The HPB team imagine their platform making waves in several industries, including:
Medical
Finance
Data management
Their medical use case responds directly to a Chinese government report which lists problems and necessary improvements of the Chinese medical system. They believe that through development on top of the HPB they can make these problems a thing of the past. Their primary contribution to this would be through easing data sharing.
A localized platform which makes integrating with Chinese government institutions a breeze would have significant value in the global economy, as more and more entrepreneurs seek to expand beyond international borders.
Token & Investment Information
Regarding the token, we get a few more details in English that are relevant.
The maximum that could have been generated, based on their funding goals, is 28.6M HPB tokens. The lowest cost of these tokens was about .00077 Ether each (or the equivalent in Bitcoin or NEO), but the current cost is .001 Ether each token (if the sale schedule is correct). To get issued the token, it appears you send your Ether to this address. As far as we can tell, you have until August 15th at midnight.
Analyst Disposition
It's clear to this author that the High Performance Blockchain initiative does not want his western monies. If they did, more information in English would be available. As such, it's probably unsafe to invest without a reliable translator to get all the requisite details for you. But if we're going to place bets on the likelihood that this will turn a profit at a rate of .001 Ether per token, we can use our grizzled nose to issue a gut-based rating of 2.7.
Something like this is much too murky to get overly behind. Many of the concepts which are touched upon in the HPB whitepaper are being thoroughly pursued by efforts specifically focused on them. This doesn't detract from its potential. They've raised a large sum already, nearly $2 million. With this kind of runway, they should be able to build something of use, but will it be a big profitable thing which makes the HPB token in high demand? Hard to believe without a lot more information, and such information is hard to come by for a lowly English speaker like this author.
Much like NEO itself, it's something that could hold serious potential but requires a lot of extra legwork to become educated about. As such, it's not a beginner-level investment at all. Timing exits, consolidations, et cetera would be much more difficult than with a typical instrument, and the hazard of acting badly but in good faith is very high.

You have probably read it a thousand times how year X will the year of the Linux desktop, only to know deep down that this will be repeated again next year by some tech blog/pundit with some news on how awesome Linux is doing in the desktop market because of some obscure government program of buying pre-installing Linux desktop for school/community.
The problem is that our expectation is not aligned properly with the reality. As a matter of fact, our expectation with Linux Desktop visibility and penetration is way out of whack. Whether you like it or not there will be no single year where there will be a wholesale shift in market share where people will suddenly start using Linux. Reasons being:
– Not everyone buys a new computer every year.
– People who do buy a new computer is likely to go with the OS they are familiar with.
– Most people are not tech-savvy enough to start downloading Linux ISO and install it.
– Users are increasingly moving away from desktop computers to mobile devices like phone/tablets.
The problem is that we not only have unreasonable expectations but also unreasonable metrics for our unreasonable expectations. I think to call a certain year the “year of the Linux desktop” we need to stop looking at the number of Linux install on the desktop environment and start looking at the factors that's stopping Linux from crossing that tipping point and becoming a dominant force in the desktop market.
Let's look at the reasons why Linux have had a hard time on the desktop and how in 2013 things will (might) change for the better:
Gaming on Linux:
For most tech pundits, big label games not being available on Linux environment is one of the main reasons there is no wide adoption of Linux. I tend to disagree. It's not that the availability of good games on Linux is hampering its adoption but the availability of good driver support for the graphics card is hampering Linux adoption. It's a classic chicken and egg problem. The game developers don't make games for Linux because Linux doesn't have good stable drivers for high-end graphic cards. The graphic card manufacturers don't put enough resources to support all graphics card on Linux because there are not enough Linux users to be worth the trouble for them. It's a no-win situation and we needed someone outside (or rather inside the gaming industry) to really rattle the cage and wake everyone up and start noticing Linux as a viable platform for Graphic card manufacturers to spend their resources on. Valve's entry into the Linux world has really done the world of good for the future of Linux. People, who matter, are starting to notice. Don't get me wrong, we are far from seeing major AAA games on Linux, but it's a tipping point and we have finally crossed that in 2013. We might not see huge traction in 2013 for games in Linux just yet, but this will be known as the year when things started happening for games in Linux. I also think that HumbleBundle did a world of good to bring the game to Linux and probably doesn't get enough credit for their work.
Ubuntu:
I strongly believe that Ubuntu has done more to bring Linux to the desktop environment than anyone else. It's true they might not contribute enough back to upstream but they have repackaged Linux to be an insanely easy to use and pleasing to eyes for mass adoption, more than any other Linux distribution. And in 2013, with their entry into the mobile market, they are in a unique position, if done right, to be a game changer. Imagine a mobile phone when plugged into your computer becomes a full-fledged desktop OS. Unlike the current mobile OS which is built for the mobile environment, Ubuntu Phone OS can be built both for mobile and desktop environment.
Linux on Mobile:
As mentioned before I believe the future of personal computing will have a dramatic shift towards mobile devices. The screen on mobile devices are getting bigger and the performance is getting better over time. Other than some special purpose hardware-intensive application, today you can do almost everything on your mobile devices (and more) that you could do on your desktop. The mobile device is the new desktop. The good news is that Linux is already a dominant player in the mobile market, thanks to android. And with the inclusion of Firefox OS and Ubuntu Phone into the mobile market this year the Linux market share will only get stronger over time.
Final Thought
I think instead of only looking at the numbers in market penetration, we have to start looking at the market situation as a whole. To me, if there ever was a single year where Linux has reached that tipping point to start making a dent in the desktop market, 2013 is it. So maybe in 2014, we can stop looking for the year of the Linux desktop and start looking at the year of Linux dominance.
An article published today in the journal Pediatrics confirms what parents and advocacy organizations have been saying for years: many individuals with autism suffer from gastrointestinal disease that can contribute to behaviors and symptoms associated with autism.
Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Gastrointestinal Disorders in Individuals With ASDs: A Consensus Report is the result of expert panel study and discussion led by Dr. Timothy Buie of the Harvard Medical School Department of Pediatrics. The panel's findings point out not only the existence of underlying GI disturbances that can manifest as behavioral problems, but also notes that such medical issues have often gone undiagnosed or been ignored in the past by physicians treating patients diagnosed with autism.
"We are finally getting mainstream acknowledgement that our kids are physically sick, and not the victims of some mysterious genetic behavioral disorder," commented Lori McIlwain, National Autism Association (NAA) board chair. "With one in 110 children now diagnosed with autism, we are in the midst of a national health emergency. Physicians must address the underlying medical conditions involved in this epidemic if they are to help us find answers and relief for our children."
The panel arrived at several conclusions regarding current clinical practice guidelines and made recommendations for future medical and research priorities. These include:
Current treatment guidelines do not routinely consider potential medical problems
Problem behaviors including self-injury, aggression, irritability, and sleep disturbance may be manifestations of abdominal pain
Behavioral treatment should not substitute for medical treatment
Gastrointestinal symptoms should be considered an urgent indication for medical investigation
Immunologic dysfunction, inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and allergies are all potentially associated with autism
Research is needed to determine the role of abnormal GI permeability in neuropsychiatric manifestations of autism
Greater awareness is needed among health care providers of the atypical manifestations of GI disorders
Awareness of unrecognized medical conditions in autism must become a priority of professional societies including the American Academy of Pediatrics
Diagnostics should be performed to accurately identify co-morbid allergic disease
Research is needed to determine the role of immune dysfunction in autism
"This is definitely a step in the right direction," said Ms. McIlwain. "Our kids need and deserve clinical investigation and treatment for the underlying medical conditions from which they suffer."

The co-ordinated raids on dark-web sites may have come about because of flaws in the anonymous browser
The Tor project, which oversees the development of the anonymous browser, has expressed concern over an intergovernmental operation that took down 27 hosts offering “hidden services”, or websites only accessible through the Tor network.
The operation, a collaboration between US and EU authorities, went by the codename “Onymous” and resulted in the seizure of more than 400 hidden services.However, the authorities have not revealed how they discovered the location of the hidden services. Tor's design should prevent these locations from being revealed.
The Tor project says in a blogpost: “In liberal democracies, we should expect that when the time comes to prosecute some of the 17 people who have been arrested, the police would have to explain to the judge how the suspects came to be suspects. As a side benefit of the operation of justice, Tor could learn if there are security flaws in hidden services or other critical internet-facing services.
“Tor is most interested in understanding how these services were located, and if this indicates a security weakness in Tor hidden services that could be exploited by criminals or secret police repressing dissents.”
Among the sites closed in the dark-web takedown was Silk Road 2.0, a successor to the original online black marketplace, where an array of vendors sold both legal and illegal using the cryptocurrency bitcoin. A total of 17 suspects were arrested in the operation, with Californian Blake Benthall accused of running Silk Road 2.0.
The authorities suggest that they discovered Benthall through a rookie error, alleging that the developer registered the server for the site using a personal email address. However, Tor warns that “the US DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] and others have constructed a system of organised and sanctioned perjury which they refer to as ‘parallel construction'” that entails reporting not how they did locate a particular person, but merely how they could have done so.
Tor suggests that such “operational security” errors may have led to some operators being uncovered, but also addresses other potential holes. An SQL injection attack, or other exploitation of a “common web bug”, could have been one way in, as could an attack through the bitcoin network.
The Tor developers are most concerned about the possibility that the hidden services were discovered through a weakness in the protocol itself: “The number of takedowns and the fact that Tor relays were seized could also mean that the Tor network was attacked to reveal the location of those hidden services. We received some interesting information from an operator of a now-seized hidden service which may indicate this, as well.”
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The Russian ambassador to Poland has sparked outrage for putting some of the blame for World War II on Poland, creating a new spat amid deepening tensions between the Slavic nations.
Russian Ambassador Sergey Andreev on Friday described the Soviet's 1939 invasion of Poland as an act of self-defense, not aggression. The comment prompted Poland's Foreign Ministry to declare Saturday that the ambassador “undermines historical truth” and seems to be trying to justify Stalinist crimes.
World War II began after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union sealed a pact in 1939 that included a secret provision to carve up Poland and other parts of Eastern Europe. Germany soon invaded Poland from the West, followed by a Soviet invasion from the east 16 days later. Millions of Poles were killed in the war.

In an interview broadcast on the private TVN station, Andreev also said: “Polish policy led to the disaster in September 1939, because during the 1930s Poland repeatedly blocked the formation of a coalition against Hitler's Germany. Poland was therefore partly responsible for the disaster which then took place.”
Poland's Foreign Ministry expressed “surprise and alarm” at those comments, and Foreign Minister Grzegorz Schetyna summoned Andreev for a meeting Monday on the matter.
“The narrative presented by the highest official representative of the Russian state in Poland undermines the historical truth and reflects the most hypocritical interpretation of the events known from the Stalinist and communist years,” the ministry said in a statement.
Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz also expressed displeasure with the ambassador.
“The role of an ambassador accredited in a country should be to build harmony and friendly relations between countries,” Kopacz said.
Relations have never been easy since Poland, a former Soviet bloc nation, rejected Moscow's control and embraced the West, joining NATO and the European Union. But tensions have been especially high since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a step that Warsaw has strongly condemned.
In other points of contention in recent days, Poland blocked a Crimean official hoping to attend an OSCE conference in Warsaw from entering the country, angering Moscow. Moscow has also protested a Polish town's dismantling of a monument to a Soviet World War II general, threating Warsaw with “most serious consequences” for that.

Supporters cheer for then-candidate Donald Trump during a campaign rally last year in Tampa. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
“Donald Trump has become a white working-class symbol because he is the one who has returned them to prominence in American politics.”
Unlike anyone I've read or talked to since the November election, Justin Gest has helped me to really understand why President Trump won white working-class voters and hasn't thus far lost their support. In the latest episode of “Cape Up,” we discuss the George Mason University professor's new book, “The New Minority: White Working Class Politics in an Age of Immigration and Inequality”
LISTEN HERE

“So much of Donald Trump's politics is symbolic,” Gest explained. “They're symbolic in the sense that this is what people want to hear and if it doesn't get done, it's almost beside the point because he's elevating the prerogatives of his constituents to the national stage after having been relegated to the fringes of American politics for decades.”
[Working-class whites can't handle their status as ‘the new minority']
“When Donald Trump went up in Cleveland and said messianically,'I am your voice,' that's precisely what people heard,” Gest continued. “The sense of having a voice suddenly, after feeling voiceless for so long is powerful. It's not in their cultural interests to vote against him, no matter how little he has delivered to actually help them in any kind of material way.”
Justin Gest, assistant professor of public policy at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government, talks with The Post's Jonathan Capehart during an interview for the “Cape Up” podcast. (Jessica Stahl/The Washington Post)
Working-class whites feel not only voiceless, but also silenced, especially in matters involving race. “The way they understood racism is different from the way we understand racism,” said Gest. “For them, racism has become an instrument of silence. It is a way of invalidating people. By saying someone is a racist, it means they cease to matter. Don't listen to them.” Gest spent three months in Youngstown, Ohio, and three months in East London, England, conducting interviews and researching his book. “So, when people said to me, ‘Now, I'm not a racist but …,' what they were actually saying to me was, ‘Listen to what I'm about to tell you, and don't dismiss me.' ”
That doesn't mean race doesn't play a major role for the white working class. “Much of white working-class politics has been to create distinction with a group that they thought they were above,” Gest told me. “So much of American history has been white voters seeking to reinstate ways to subordinate people of ethno-religious and ethno-racial difference.”

Listen to the podcast to hear this important and provocative conversation about how economic dislocation and demographic changes are fueling discomfort and desperation among white working-class voters. While Gest says that both Republicans and Democrats have exploited these voters, he sees a way forward.
“The only way of addressing their plight is a form of political hospice care,” he said. “These are communities that are on the paths to death. And the question is: How can we make that as comfortable as possible?”

Satanists Luigi and Angie Bellaviste have decorations in their yard that depict their religious beliefs (credit: CBS)
– A local couple who claim to be Satanists believe they're a victim of a hate crime and were targeted because of their religious beliefs.
Someone cut down a political poster stating, “VOTE SATAN” from their front porch where they live in Mountain View, a suburb of Denver.
“We are Satanists… Satanists,” said Luigi Bellaviste.
Luigi and Angie Bellaviste belong to the Church of Satan. They even have a Satanic Bible in their home.
The couple is upset because a poster they had hanging from their front porch was recently cut down.
It wasn't very popular with some neighbors.
“Everybody that sees that sign says, ‘What is going on with those people?,'” said neighbor Mary Morasco.
The couple's home and yard are decorated with items like a Christmas tree that has been painted black, skulls and the number 666. They believe the cutting down of the poster was an attack on their religious beliefs.
“I feel like we're being treated unfairly because it's not a so-called mainstream religion,” said Luigi.
“I know of many people who have the Virgin Mary and tons of Jesus memorabilia ‘I Love Jesus' and what is the difference?” said Angie.
Despite their opinion on the couple's choice of lawn ornaments, most of the Bellaviste's neighbors are on their side.
“It's still their property. It's still their house. They have a right to say whatever they have to say,” said one neighbor.
“Everyone has their own religion… to each his own, I guess,” said another neighbor.
The couple wants the police to consider the incident a hate crime because their religion is protected by the U.S. Constitution.
“Had that been the Star of David or a verse from the Koran,” said Luigi, “or something like that got damaged by somebody against those beliefs that would certainly be considered a hate crime.”
An officer with the Mountain View Police Department said the report will likely be filed as theft because there was no obvious attack on the couple's church or religious beliefs.
South Korea will obtain 40 Lockheed Martin F-35A fighters under its F-X III requirement.
A report by state news agency Yonhap quotes the country's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) as saying that Seoul will obtain 40 F-35s starting in 2018, with an option to buy 20 more aircraft.
The deal will be conducted through the US government's Foreign Military Sales mechanism.
"The F-35A will be used as a strategic weapon to gain a competitive edge and defeat the enemy in the early stage of war," Yonhap quotes the JCS as saying. "The South Korean military will also use the aircraft to effectively deal with provocations."
Lockheed Martin
Deliveries will begin in 2018, says Yonhap.
"We will continue to work closely with the US government to meet the Republic of Korea Air Force's fighter requirements," says Lockheed. "we greatly appreciate that the Republic of Korea is pursuing a fifth-generation solution to meet their demanding security needs." The company confirms that is can supply aircraft in time to meet Seoul's 2018 objective, and in the F-35's Block 3F software configuration.
Seoul will also obtain an additional 20 fighter aircraft of unspecified type, but the timeframe and details of this acquisition are not clear.
This additional requirement would appear to leave room for Boeing and Eurofighter, which pitched the F-15 Silent Eagle and Typhoon in the original 60 aircraft F-X III competition, to make a significant sale in South Korea.
Greg Waldron/Flightglobal
At a recent defence exhibition in South Korea, Boeing dropped its F-15SE proposal in favour of an aircraft it dubs the “Advanced F-15” (above). Eurofighter continued pitching the Typhoon.
BAE Systems
An industry source familiar with South Korean defence requirements says today's F-35A announcement stems from a 30-man team recently established by the air force to push its case with the country's JCS, which has ultimate authority over force improvement decisions.
The JCS will submit this recommendation to the Defence Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), which will negotiate the final contract. The air force team will also play a role in the acquisition of South Korea's indigenous KFX fighter and a four-aircraft tanker requirement.
This should have the effect of reducing DAPA's say over platform capabilities and relegate it to a contract negotiation role.
The original F-X III requirement called for Seoul to obtain 60 new fighters. The only aircraft to come in under the DAPA's budget of won (W) 8.3 trillion ($7.7 billion) was Boeing's proposed F-15SE, an upgraded version of the venerable type with low observable features and other improvements.
In September, however, Seoul decided to re-tender the competition following the air force's reiteration that it wants a stealth aircraft to fill the requirement, and a public relations backlash in South Korean media against the selection of the F-15SE.
The FXFL is a new league that will be kicking off October 8th, 2014. They have four teams and four pretty awesome logos and helmets. The teams are the Brooklyn Bolts, Florida Blacktips, Boston Brawlers, and the Omaha Mammoths. They will play in Big Time Stadiums, and this really looks like a league that NFL Free Agents might want to consider.
The FXFL is a professional football league, which serves as a developmental platform for players, coaches and referees. Our business model places an emphasis on local marketing, cost containment and the utilization of smaller venues to better engage the fan base. In 2014, the FXFL's initial membership will be comprised of four teams playing a six game regular season schedule. Regular season games will be televised and played on weeknights nights to avoid scheduling conflicts with the NFL and collegiate football.
Well here is a little more about the FXFL, and at the bottom find out our opinion on the newest league.

Yesterday, NFL Draft Diamonds owner Damond Talbot had time to sit down with Commissioner Brian Woods, and ask the question every Agent, Scout and Player wanted to know. So here are a few things we learned from that conversation.
First off, the FXFL is being run by Brian Woods. Brian worked with the New York Jets in the past and ran the Medal of Honor Game last year which focused several NFL prospects. It also drew over 100 NFL scouts to their game. That is is the most important part for NFL Agents.
Brian understands what needs to be done, and they have worked very hard to put together this league. They wanted to focus on former NFL prospects who they feel have the best opportunity to make it to the NFL again. So if a player was recently released from the 53-man roster they want a player like that because he has a very good shot at making it to the NFL again. Remember they want to be the minor league or D-League so to speak of the NFL.
Players will be paid!!! The players will earn a weekly salary of 1000 dollars if they elect not to have housing. If they elect to have housing then they will receive 900 dollars a week. That is very cheap considering they have a team in Brooklyn where a closet costs 1500 a month to rent….:)
I wanted to find out more from NFL scouts, So I contacted four NFL scouts that all said the same thing. If they have good football players there NFL scouts will go. One NFL scout went on to say, if you are an East Coast pro scout, you can take one or two nights out a week and go to the Brooklyn game and watch tons of NFL prospects. Almost every player on these rosters have NFL experience so far.
Brian said that next week the FXFL will announce their head coaches but there are already leaks to one of the coaches, and he was a former NFL player. So as you can see, people are backing this D-League so to speak.
Here is what we feel is the most important for the players. When you leave college your game film is great. When you attend an NFL camp and you are released or get injured, your college film becomes irrelevant. Why is that?
Well let me explain. First off the guys scouting you in college football are COLLEGE Scouts, when you play a snap in the NFL even if it is a mini camp offer, they College film goes out the window in most cases. The scouts that will now be looking at you will be PRO scouts for the teams. So if you have no film, didn't make any plays, or had limited playing time you are hurting yourself by not going.
Pro scouts will look at film. What a better place to get film than the FXFL? If you go to the CFL you have to sign a two year contract. With the FXFL you are not locked into any long term deal. A matter of fact, last night the Commissioner told me that if an NFL team calls for a work-out, the player will be allowed to leave for that work-out with zero problem, because that is what the league is developed to do. Another great thing, is every practice and game will be taped. Some will be televised even in local areas. Not at the national level yet, but they could be soon.
Listen at the end of the day, what do you have to lose? I think you are crazy if you don't take a shot at the FXFL.
Jihadi Cool: Terrorist Recruiters' Latest Weapon
Enlarge this image toggle caption AFP/Getty Images AFP/Getty Images
With so many terrorism cases emerging in the U.S. in the past nine months, experts are trying to understand why so much is happening now. One explanation has less to do with religion than with adventure. The latest wave of jihadists traveling to Pakistan and elsewhere for training may have been motivated by a sense of jihadi cool.
The recent Jihad Jane case may be the latest example of this trend.
Colleen LaRose, 46, was a housebound woman from the Philadelphia area. She converted to Islam, but investigators say she was never connected to any particular mosque. Even her live-in boyfriend says he didn't know she was Muslim.
And yet, she is accused of calling herself Jihad Jane in Internet chat rooms, and soon after her conversion allegedly went trolling for people who might join forces with her to wage jihad on behalf of other Muslims.
Recruitment More MTV Than Mosque
That's a far cry from what is seen as the traditional route to jihad. It used to be that jihadi recruitment videos opened with the call to prayer and readings from the Quran.
These days, many of them are decidedly less religious. They look more like something that would appear on MTV.
If you type "jihadi rap videos" into any Internet search engine, you'll find dozens of videos with thumping bass lines and forced rhymes about beheading non-Muslims and making them pay for the indignities they have leveled against Islam.
toggle caption
The productions are clearly aimed at young people nursing resentments and looking for thrills. One video raps about the "angels in green, helping the mujahedeen" while cutting to photographs of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib and homemade videos of holy warriors firing rocket-propelled grenades in the desert and shooting up cars with machine guns.
'A New Generation Of Lazy Muslims'
Intelligence officials say there is a wave of young people who are attracted to the adventure of jihad but would like to skip all the rigors of Islam, such as reading the Quran and fasting.
"I think what we are seeing is sort of what I like to term a new generation of lazy Muslims," says Arsalan Iftikhar, a human rights lawyer and the former national legal director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
"These are people who might not be theologically devout or even have a sound religious foundation, but they are using this new jihadi cool to justify criminal acts of terrorism," Iftikhar says.
Experts who study these kinds of movements say that while religion may be an initial motivation to sign up, in the fullness of time, it becomes less important.
Seeking Adventure
Consider the case of the two dozen young Somali-Americans from Minneapolis who were recruited to join a militant group in Somalia a couple of years ago.
Initially, investigators say recruiters used a religious pitch. Ethiopians — who were largely Christian — had invaded Somalia, a Muslim country. The young Minnesotans were told it was their duty, both as Somalis and Muslims, to go to Somalia and fight there for an Islamist group called al-Shabab.
We have ethnographies where they actually ask militants what drew you to this movement. The top three answers were motorcycles, guns and access to women. You had to go pretty far down the list to get to religious motivation.
When the Ethiopian troops withdrew, FBI officials say the pitch changed. Recruiters told the young men that going to Somalia would be, in their words, fun. The young men would get to shoot guns. They would become jihad warriors. It would be cool.
Christine Fair is a professor at Georgetown University who is an expert in these kinds of religious movements. She says jihad chic is not so unusual.
"We have ethnographies where they actually ask militants what drew you to this movement," she says. "The top three answers were motorcycles, guns and access to women. You had to go pretty far down the list to get to religious motivation."
The Web And Jihad Warriors
The Internet appears to have made signing up for a holy war infinitely easier — and because it is open to all comers, the standards have dropped. People who might not have even considered becoming a Muslim, much less turning to jihad, can do both with just the click of a mouse.
That's what officials think happened with Jihad Jane. They allege that she trolled the Internet while she was housebound, caring for her boyfriend's ailing father, and that signing up for a holy war was something that attracted a lonely woman. It gave her something to belong to, officials say.
"Just putting my human hat on, I don't think it is remotely remarkable that Jihad Jane happened," says Fair, who is also a fellow at West Point's Combating Terrorism Center.
"In fact, if you sort of think about misfits — I'm a social misfit so I feel somewhat comfortable saying this — the Internet is one of the best places for social misfits to reside," Fair says. "They can be whomever they want to be, so I am just surprised we haven't had more Jihad Janes."
This is not to minimize what is going on for the past year on the terrorism front. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, 2009 was the busiest year for U.S. counterterrorism officials. They prosecuted more than a dozen cases; the annual average is generally one-third of that.
FBI Director Robert Mueller says the Internet is partly to blame for speeding up the recruitment process. He says the Web now not only radicalizes young Muslims but helps connect them to organizations that launch attacks. Jihadi cool may be a different motivation for taking up arms, but it isn't necessarily any less lethal.
What It Means to Offer Internet Connectivity to an End-Consumer
The argument over net neutrality is being muddled by semantic definition arguments. I have a very simple fix as a proposal.
When a service provider markets to an end-consumer unlimited Internet access for a monthly fee, the ISP has an obligation to take all commercially reasonable action to maximize the bandwidth of all traffic towards the cap of the subscription. To be explicitly specific: If Comcast offers John Smith in Iowa a 20mb/s connection to the Internet for $39.99/mo, Comcast must take all commercially reasonable steps to ensure that John gets 20mb/s access at all times to all services. Comcast is only responsible for it's own network and its end of the interconnection to other networks.
If Comcast does anything to degrade John's internet access to certain services on the Internet, it is misleading to claim they are offering “Internet” access at all. It's an abuse of marketing, a misrepresentation of the service offered, and in my opinion solid ground for a class-action lawsuit.
If Comcast wants to market an Internet-alternative service, lets call it Smuckynet, they are totally free to do so. Smuckynet access could be a subset of the Internet, and could require non-net-neutral tolls to content providers. We live in an open, free market, and if there is consumer demand for Smuckynet, then I wish Comcast the best of luck with their new product and congratulate them in advance on their future success. I for one would never pay for Smuckynet. I might use it for free if offered, the same way I used Facebook and Google for free, knowing that ultimately, I am the product.
Offering unlimited Internet access to end-consumers at a premium price, while subversively and deliberately gating traffic to popular web services in order to extract business ransom has to stop. It is misleading to claim this is Internet access; in practice is a different product from Internet access, one that turns the end-consumer into a product to be sold to the content providers.
I do not trust the ISPs to self-regulate on their offering of “Internet” access due to the natural monopoly created by running cables to homes. The possible conclusion as to whether government regulation is the correction solution is left as an exercise for the reader, based on your personal politics.

Dude, when even the progressive, Leftist fanatics at the ACLU are telling you something is a bad idea? Just wow.
Apparently they feel the same way about the Trump Free Speech Rally as most other sane, rational and thinking Americans do – check out this epic rant:

Physicists Reveal Novel Magnetoelectric Effect
Photo Submitted
FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — New research at the University of Arkansas reveals a novel magnetoelectric effect that makes it possible to control magnetism with an electric field.
The novel mechanism may provide a new route for using multiferroic materials for the application of RAM (random access memories) in computers and other devices, such as printers.
An international research team, led by U of A physicist, reported its findings in an article titled, “Prediction of a Novel Magnetoelectric Switching Mechanism in Multiferroics,” on Feb. 5 in the journal Physical Review Letters.
The researchers studied a new predicted state of the multiferroic bismuth ferrite, a compound that can change its electrical polarization when under a magnetic field or magnetic properties when under an electric field. Because of these effects, bismuth ferrite interests researchers who want to design novel devices — based on magnetoelectric conversion.
The “coupling mechanism” in bismuth ferrite between magnetic order and electrical polarization order is required for this phenomenon to be clearly understood, said Yurong Yang, a research assistant professor of physics in the J. William Fulbright College of Arts and Sciences.
“We discovered an unknown magnetoelectric switching mechanism,” Yang said. “In this mechanism, the magnetic order and electrical polarization are not coupled directly, they are coupled with oxygen octahedral tilting, respectively. The switching polarization by electric field leads to the change of the sense of the rotation of oxygen octahedral, which in turn induces the switching of the magnetic order.
“These two couplings are governed by an interaction between three different physical quantities, called ‘tri-linear coupling,' he said. “In contrast with the trilinear-coupling effects in the literature, the new coupling involves a large polarization and thus can be easily tuned by an electric field.”
Yang performed calculations with the assistance of the Arkansas High Performing Computing Center at the University of Arkansas. He was joined in the study by Laurent Bellaiche, a Distinguished Professor of physics at the U of A. Bellaiche and Yang conducted their research in the university's Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering.
Also collaborating on the paper were Jorge Iniguez of the Materials Science Institute at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain and Ai-Jie Mao of the Institute of Atomic and Molecular Physics at Sichuan University in China.
Initially at least, investors did not appear particularly troubled by news of the inflated user figures. Twitter shares were up 10 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.
The company said it had discovered that its measure of monthly active users had been improperly including figures from third-party applications that used Digits, a software-development program. Digits are part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Google's parent company, this year.
Digits allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages through Twitter's systems and did not reflect activity on the Twitter platform, the company said.
As a result, the company lowered the number of monthly active users by two million for the first and second quarters of this year and by one million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Twitter said its data-retention policies made it unable to reconcile the figures for periods before last year's fourth quarter.
“Our estimates suggest the prior period adjustments are smaller than those in the fourth quarter of 2016,” the company said.
Twitter said that — in addition to the uptick in daily active users — it had experienced a 4 percent increase in monthly active users from the same period last year, to 330 million. The company had 326 million monthly active users in the second quarter.
In a victory for election integrity, the Wisconsin Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the state's voter ID law against separate challenges by the NAACP and the League of Women Voters. The justices joined the state supreme courts of Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee—as well as the U.S. Supreme Court—in finding laws requiring photo IDs to vote constitutional.
The judges in Wisconsin concluded the plaintiffs in the Wisconsin cases “failed to prove” the law was discriminatory or would keep anyone from voting.
Justice Patience Roggensack, who wrote the majority opinion in both cases, said in the NAACP case that “the burdens of time and inconvenience associated” with obtaining an ID “are not undue burdens on the right to vote and do not render the law invalid.”
This is particularly true, she wrote, because needing a photo ID “is a condition of our times where more and more personal interactions are being modernized to require proof of identify with a specified type of photo identification.” Requiring a photo ID, she added, is a “familiar” burden to voters because it accompanies “many of our everyday tasks.”
Although the Wisconsin law does provide that a free photo ID can be obtained for voting, the court also held that the state could not charge a fee for any supporting documentation needed to obtain the ID, such as the cost of a birth certificate. Because Wisconsin has a tradition of “jealously guarding and protecting” the right to vote, payment of any fee cannot be “an electoral standard.” Thus, the court interpreted the new photo ID law to require the state Division of Motor Vehicles, which issues driver's licenses and photo IDs, to issue IDs for voting “without requiring documents for which an elector must pay a fee to a government agency.”
With that proviso, the court found the photo ID law constitutional and “reasonably related to the State's significant interests” in “protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process, maintain public confidence in election results and preventing voter fraud.”
In both cases, Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who was appointed to the court in 1976 by former Democratic Gov. Patrick Lucey, wrote dissenting opinions. In the League of Women Voters case, which was decided by a 4-3 vote, she claimed, as have other opponents of voter ID laws, that Wisconsin's law “brings the specter of Jim Crow front and center.” This is racial demagoguery of the worst kind.
This decision lifted the injunction that had been issued by a state circuit court. It does not affect another injunction issued by federal District Court Judge Lynn Adelman, a Clinton appointee and former Democratic state senator. As I have previously written, Adelman refused to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, in which a majority of the Court upheld the constitutionality of an ID law in Indiana that was even stricter than Wisconsin's law.
Wisconsin's attorney general, J.B. Van Hollen, has appealed that decision to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. He hopes the state supreme court's decisions will help him convince the appeals court to overturn Adelman's decision, according to his spokeswoman, Dana Brueck.
Gov. Scott Walker (R), probably said it best. “Voter ID is a common-sense reform that protects the integrity of our elections,” he said in reaction to the decisions. “People need to have confidence in our electoral process and to know that their vote has been properly counted.”

No Production For Two Months Admits Chevron
172 SHARES Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Linkedin
No production for two months admits Chevron, as the oil major moves to clarify the situation at its $54 billion Gorgon LNG development.
After more than six years of construction and spiralling costs, totalling an eye watering US$54 billion; Chevron was finally able to announce first LNG production from its mammoth Gorgon project back in March 2016, and its first shipment two weeks later.
However fast forward a mere two weeks, and reports started to emerge that the entire plant had shutdown due to an issue with a refrigeration system used to cool the produced gas into liquid.
Gorgon Shuts Down
In a bid to suppress growing speculation, Chevron released a statement admitting that there was an issue with the plant, connected to the propane refrigerant circuit on train 1. The company further admitted that the issue would mean a delay in achieving the developments second shipment.
Australian media later published claims from sources within Gorgon that the issue was no quick-fix, and far from cheap but, likely to cost in excess of US$100 million.
No Production For Two Months Admits Chevron
Today Chevon has moved to clarify the situation further stating that a restart of the plant could take up to 60 days.
A spokesman added: “Work necessary to complete the repairs is ongoing while the site team continues equipment inspection and assessment. Based on initial findings, the repair work is of a routine nature and all the necessary equipment and material is available on site.”
Train 1 is currently the only train to have been completed, preventing Chevron from liquefying and shipment any gas. When questioned on this the spokesman added: “Construction activities continue to progress on LNG Trains 2 and 3 with timing not affected by the work on Train 1.”
However, no comment has been made one the estimated cost of the fix.
Unhappy Business Partners
The ongoing issues are said to have caused dismay amongst Chevron's biggest partners in Gorgon- ExxonMobil and Shell. Apart from the ongoing delays and spiralling costs, Both ExxonMobil and Shell are yet to see any return from the development.
Under the ownership structure of the Gorgon, each cargo of LNG is delivered to the customers of an individual partner, on a rotational basis. The rotation runs: Chevron, Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil before moving back to Chevron at the start; with only one cargo yet achieved.
Greater Gorgon Development
Gorgon development produces from offshore gas fields, located between 80 miles (130 km) and 136 miles (220 km) off the northwest coast of Western Australia; whilst refining, refrigeration and liquefaction occurs at the Barrow Island plant 53 miles (85km) off the Australian mainland.

A new study shows that astronauts from the Apollo missions have a rate of cardiovascular disease mortality nearly five times that of other astronauts, suggesting that even short missions outside Earth's protective geomagnetic field have long-term health consequences. Researchers compared cause of death for seven Apollo astronauts to that of 35 astronauts who had flown in low Earth orbit, and 35 who had never flown orbital missions. Published in Nature , the study may have implications for future efforts to send humans into deep space. The authors also conducted experiments with mice to learn more about how weightlessness and deep space radiation affect the cardiovascular system. We speak with lead author Michael Delp The work is a study of mortality rate, so we looked at the causes of death in each of three groups: Apollo astronauts, low Earth orbit astronauts, and non-flight astronauts. The Apollo lunar astronauts are the only humans to have traveled into deep space, beyond the protective magnetosphere surrounding the Earth. We found that death due to cardiovascular disease was higher in the Apollo astronauts than the other groups.The small sample size is a limitation of the study. One has to use caution in drawing definitive conclusions. Despite this limitation, we thought it was important to publish these results because it is also difficult to ignore the possibility that deep space travel, including deep space radiation, may be having a much more adverse effect on cardiovascular health than previously estimated. With countries and companies like SpaceX stating planning to send humans back into deep space as early as ten years from now, there is not a lot of time to experimentally address the possible implications of these results with Apollo astronauts and answer the many outstanding questions surrounding space radiation effects on the cardiovascular system. For example, it over a year just to complete the experiments in the one mouse study we conducted for this paper. And Brookhaven National Laboratory is the only place in the US where deep space radiation exposures can be simulated.In a previous study published earlier this year, we examined the early effects of simulated weightlessness, space-relevant radiation, and a combination of the two in mice, similar to what was done in the present study. We found that the weightlessness simulation group produced an impairment of the blood vessels (via the endothelium) of the type that could predispose the arteries to the development of atherosclerotic plaque, also that the radiation produces a similar sort of impairment to the vascular endothelium, and finally that the combination of simulated weightlessness and space radiation produced and even greater impairment than either treatment alone. Please note that these studies were conducted immediately at the conclusion of the treatment period. The results suggested that weightlessness and space radiation may interact to cause greater impairment of the cardiovascular system.In the present study, we are not looking at the early effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system in astronauts, but rather what happens years after their return from space. So we used the same treatment groups and repeated the earlier study, except now instead of doing the vascular experiments immediately after the treatments, we waited 6-7 months, which is the equivalent to about 20 human years. The results were that the weightlessness simulation did not show a sustained impairment of the endothelium, only the radiation treatment did. Thus, it does not appear that the cardiovascular deconditioning that occurs in weightlessness has any prolonged adverse effects. This point is supported by the low Earth orbit astronauts not having any difference in cardiovascular mortality relative to the non-flight astronauts. Only radiation seems to show a sustained impairment.Radiation damage impairing the endothelial cells lining blood vessels may be a precipitating event to the long-term development of cardiovascular disease. Healthy endothelial cells help prevent atherosclerotic plaque from forming inside the walls of blood vessels—commonly referred to as hardening of the arteries. When the endothelial cells are impaired, like we found with radiation exposure in the mice, then this could predispose these arteries to a prolonged formation of plaque. In the heart this can cause ischemia (low blood flow) and coronary heart disease, or in the brain it could cause ischemic stroke.Improving shielding effectiveness and anti-oxidant treatment would be a couple of means to help mitigate the risk.Featured image courtesy of NASA

MP Ian Lavery received £165,000 from the 10-member trade union he ran.
We have learned this from the trade union regulator which has now released a report into Mr Lavery's actions as general secretary of the NUM Northumberland Area.
He will now face questions on his record over a number of disputed payments by the union he ran.
Mr Lavery, who is the chairman of the Labour Party, denies any wrongdoing.
Ian Lavery is a coming power in the land, Jeremy Corbyn's general election joint co-ordinator and chairman of the Labour Party. If the Conservatives fall, he's most likely destined for high office. But, perhaps, for one thing: his refusal to answer a simple question asked by BBC Newsnight last year: "Did you pay off the mortgage?" BBC Newsnight asked him nine times without getting a reply.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Newsnight's John Sweeney confronts Labour MP Ian Lavery
The answer, it turns out, is no. He didn't pay off his mortgage. The union of which he was a general secretary for 18 years, the NUM Northumberland Area, paid it off and paid him much more besides.
Last year, both Jeremy Corbyn and the parliamentary watchdog cleared Mr Lavery. He denies any wrongdoing.
The reason we know more about Mr Lavery's peculiar mortgage arrangements is because the trade union regulator, the Certification Officer, Gerard Walker, examined the books after investigations by BBC Newsnight and the Sunday Times. Mr Lavery ran the NUM Northumberland Area for 18 years until he stepped down in 2010 to become the MP for Wansbeck.
The regulator's findings are available online.
The regulator found that that the Northumberland Provident and Benevolent fund had lent Mr Lavery £72,500 to buy a house in 1994. 13 years on, the union Mr Lavery was then running forgave the loan to Mr Lavery. So he was £72,500 the richer.
But there's more. He'd been paying into an endowment fund to pay back the capital cost of the house. It had underperformed, but it still paid out £18,000. The regulator found Mr Lavery kept that too.
And that's not all.
The regulator found that in 2005, Mr Lavery sold a 15% stake in his house to the Union for £36,000. In 2013 the house was worth less, so he bought it back from the union for £27,500 - a notional profit of £8,500.
And then there's Mr Lavery's "termination payments", totalling £89,887.83. However, that total is a matter of some dispute between him and the union.
The regulator says that neither Mr Lavery nor the union could provide documentary evidence of the process or the decision by which Mr Lavery was made redundant - or why, given he was leaving for a job as an MP, he needed any redundancy payments at all.
Adding £89,887 he received for his undocumented redundancy package to the £72,500 for the forgiven house loan to the £18,000 he was gifted from his endowment, that totals £180,387.
But, then, it seems Mr Lavery and his old union fell out. The union recently realised it had overpaid Mr Lavery's redundancy by £30,600. The regulator's report shows that the union asked for it back. Mr Lavery disputed £10,600 of it - and said he'd only give them £15,000. When the regulator asked the union why they settled for this, they simply replied that they were mindful of Mr Lavery disputing it and the potential legal costs:
"Mr. Lavery was adamant that £15,000 was his final offer, we were left with little choice but to accept."
So our running total of dosh from the union to its one-time general secretary is reduced by £15,000 to £165,387. That's a bob or two in anyone's language.
A year ago, when we started questioning Mr Lavery on this matter, Jeremy Corbyn gave him the benefit of the doubt and the Parliamentary commissioner cleared him of wrongdoing, which he has always denied. Since then, Mr Lavery has risen in Labour's ranks to be one of the Labour leader's closest and most trusted lieutenants.

Now that we know just how much money he got from the trade union he used to run, it's fair to ask whether this man is a fit and proper person to be chairman of the Labour Party.
Ian Lavery told BBC Newsnight in a statement tonight:
"Under my stewardship, the union always complied with the rules and the Certification Officer signed off every year's transactions. As the Certification Officer's report makes clear, no member of the union, past or present, has made a complaint about the financial affairs of the union. I am pleased that the Certification Officer has decided to not appoint an inspector or take further action.
"This report should draw a line under almost two years of allegations and innuendo directed at me and my former colleagues. Our legacy is helping miners and their families when others abandoned them, bringing millions of pounds of compensation into the Northumberland Coalfield. I remain immensely proud of our record."
The City of Columbia, S.C. police department (CPD) is a joke, people … but if you live in South Carolina's capital city, you knew that already.
Here's how it works: If you're a violent criminal or a gang member, you're pretty much free to rape and plunder at will. But if you're a college kid trying to enjoy a beer on the weekend … they will hunt you down like the dog you are.
How come? Easy: There's a lot of money to be made in busting underage drinkers (especially in a college town like Columbia) but not so much to be made in actually fighting crime. Of course that's why we give law enforcement tens of millions of dollars in tax money every year, but whatever. We digress.
Anyway …
The CPD's interim police chief Ruben Santiago took to Facebook this week to brag about seizing $40,000 worth of marijuana from the apartment of a Columbia, S.C. man – another glaring example of piss poor public safety prioritization.
Santiago's social media chest pumping prompted one poster, Brian Whitmer, to respond with what pretty much everyone was thinking.
“Maybe u should arrest the people shooting people in 5 points instead of worrying about a stoner that's not bothering anyone. It'll be legal here one day anyway,” Whitmer wrote.
That's a legitimate criticism right? Right …
Of course … but the interim chief was not amused.
“We have arrested all the violent offenders in Five (P)oints,” Santiago responded. “Thank you for sharing your views and giving us reasonable suspicion to believe you might be a criminal, we will work on finding you.”
Wait … what???
Santiago quickly deleted his comment (and Whitmer's original remark), but not before the exchange had been screen-capped.
Take a look …

Of course shortly thereafter Santiago doubled down on his ridiculous statement, writing in a subsequent post “I put everyone on notice that if you advocate for the use of illegal substances in the City of Columbia then it's reasonable to believe that you MIGHT also be involved in that particular activity.”
Really?
That's about the most ridiculous logic we've ever heard …
This website's founding editor hasn't touched alcohol or drugs in more than seven years … yet FITS is the Palmetto State's foremost media advocate for the de-criminalization of marijuana and other drugs (and the foremost critic of this nation's colossally failed “war” against these substances).
Does that mean Santiago has “reasonable” suspicion to come after us, too?
What a joke …
Ruben Santiago needs to spend more time fighting real crime and less time threatening people for expressing their views.

Voyager continues exploring frontier of the solar system
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted: March 8, 2011
Controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory have commanded one of NASA's daring Voyager probes to spin around this week in a bid to detect a bend in the solar wind at the edge of the solar system, the agency announced Tuesday.

More than three decades since launching from Earth, NASA's Voyager probes continue beaming back scientific data from the unexplored frontier of the solar system. Flying nearly 11 billion miles from Earth, the Voyager 1 spacecraft is surveying one of the least-known reaches of the solar system -- the region where the sun's influence wanes and interstellar space begins. Voyager 1's low energy charged particle instrument registered a strange reading last June indicating the speed of the solar wind had dropped to zero. The solar wind, a flow of charged particles, normally streams away from the sun at a million miles per hour. Scientists know such a measurement is misleading. The solar wind curves in the heliosheath, the outer edge of the solar system where Voyager 1 is now exploring. Inside the heliosheath, the solar wind is slowed by the pressure of interstellar gas. The heliosphere, the area of the sun's influence, is shaped like a bubble in the sun's direction of travel and stretches out like a tail behind. "Because the direction of the solar wind has changed and its radial speed has dropped to zero, we have to change the orientation of Voyager 1 so the low energy charged particle instrument can act like a kind of weather vane to see which way the wind is now blowing," said Edward Stone, Voyager's project manager at the California Institute of Technology. The nuclear-powered spacecraft rolled 70 degrees counterclockwise Monday and held that position for more than two-and-a-half hours with its rapidly spinning gyrocopes, according to a JPL press release. It was the second such roll-and-hold maneuver for Voyager since 1990. According to JPL, five more such spins are planned over the next seven days to point Voyager 1's charged particle sensor in different directions. Researchers hope to catch a whiff of the solar wind and gauge which way it is turning, but it could be months before results are released. It takes 16 hours just for Voyager 1's radio signals to reach Earth.

"Knowing the strength and direction of the wind is critical to understanding the shape of our solar bubble and estimating how much farther it is to the edge of interstellar space," Stone said. More weekly rolls are on tap over the next three months, according to NASA. "We do whatever we can to make sure the scientists get exactly the kinds of data they need, because only the Voyager spacecraft are still active in this exotic region of space," said Jefferson Hall, Voyager mission operations manager at JPL. "We were delighted to see Voyager still has the capability to acquire unique science data in an area that won't likely be traveled by other spacecraft for decades to come." Voyager 1 left Earth in September 1977 and flew by Jupiter and Saturn in 1979 and 1980. An identical craft named Voyager 2 also made flyby visits to Uranus and Neptune. Both spacecraft could pass the heliopause, the border with interstellar space, later this decade. Scientists don't know when the Voyager craft will reach interstellar space, but data from the ongoing roll maneuvers could help researchers make an estimate.
Those of us who believe the war on drugs has been a failure — even a fiasco — shouldn't have to invent or exaggerate reasons for idling it down. There is more than enough evidence for the debacle without clinging to myths.
Unfortunately, last week District Attorney Mitch Morrissey was labeled a “snake” and a “villain” by a fellow Denver Democrat, Sen. Pat Steadman, for merely pointing out that a central premise of those who would reduce penalties for possessing certain drugs in Colorado is false.
Morrissey insists our prisons are not bulging with felons who've done nothing more than indulge in personal drug use.
This common claim by sentencing reform advocates is, he insists, misleading in the extreme.
Morrissey appears to be right. Colorado prisons house more than 20,000 inmates, and yet Denver — ground zero for the state's most destructive drug subculture — sent just 21 people to prison last year for the felony of possessing such drugs such as methamphetamine or ketamine. Significantly, not one was someone who screwed up just once, twice, or even three times.
Not one was simply a recreational drug user who happened to stumble into the arms of police — or, to cite the common stereotype, was ensconced in the privacy of his home when rousted from a drug-induced reverie by jackbooted cops.
Every single offender had a lengthy, sometimes staggering, history of run-ins with the law. Several were incarcerated for other crimes, too.
One fellow convicted for possessing meth had served a number of years for attempted murder. Several had prior sentences for assault or burglary. Some had served time in other states.
To be sure, a large percentage of their arrests — and in three cases, the arrests date back to the 1970s — probably were in some sense related to drugs. That was clearly true of the only woman on the list, whose drug or alcohol-related incidents span a dozen years.
But the flip side of that probability is the likelihood that some or many of them had been through drug treatment before, too, without discernible result.
The dustup between Morrissey and Steadman occurred over Senate Bill 163, which originally sought to reduce a number of drug offenses from a felony to a misdemeanor. The bill has since been amended, under pressure from district attorneys, to authorize a study of sentencing guidelines for drug offenses. In other words, it's been gutted; hence Steadman's ire.
Republican Sen. Shawn Mitchell, a co-sponsor of SB 163, is correct when he says we should be counseling and treating drug addicts rather than throwing them in prison. But as a general rule, that's already what we do with all but the incorrigible who can't stay out of other trouble — as Mitchell mostly conceded recently when we spoke.
Where Mitchell most disagrees with Morrissey is on whether prosecutors need the (hammer) of a possible felony conviction to force repeat offenders into treatment — or to take treatment seriously. Mitchell counters that misdemeanor penalties — especially for repeat offenders — are hardly trivial, and that a felony record needlessly sabotages future prospects.
“This is not legalization or decriminalization,” he emphasized. Nor would it affect drug dealing.
Mitchell speaks with the experience of a brother with a drug addiction — “what is our interest in putting him behind bars?” — and I share his conviction, as he said during a recent TV interview, that “we're not winning the war on drugs … . We're making government more powerful and police departments well armed but we're not solving the drug problem.”
Still, Colorado's prosecutors and drug courts already do appear to prefer treatment before incarceration in the vast majority of cases. So even if there's room for additional sentencing reform, we should at least acknowledge that it's not going to empty our prisons, and that prosecutors aren't snakes for merely pointing that out.

WASHINGTON — Marilyn B. Tavenner, the former Obama administration official in charge of the rollout of HealthCare.gov, was chosen on Wednesday to be the top lobbyist for the nation's health insurance industry.
Ms. Tavenner, who stepped down from her federal job in February, will become president and chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, the trade group whose members include Aetna, Anthem, Humana, Kaiser Permanente and many Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies.
As the new voice for insurers, Ms. Tavenner will lead the industry in a time of tumultuous changes and challenges, including delicate negotiations with Congress over the future of the Affordable Care Act.
On Aug. 24, she will succeed Karen M. Ignagni, a former health policy specialist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who has led the industry's lobbying arm for 22 years.

Ben Carson has surpassed Donald Trump and now narrowly leads the Republican field in the race for the nomination in the latest national CBS News/New York Times Poll.
Twenty-six percent of Republican primary voters back Carson, giving him a four-point edge over Trump (22 percent). Support for Carson has quadrupled since August.
The rest of the Republican presidential candidates lag far behind in single digits. Marco Rubio is now in third place (eight percent), followed by Jeb Bush (seven percent) and Carly Fiorina (seven percent). All other candidates are at four percent or lower.
Carson has made gains across many key Republican groups. In a reversal from earlier this month, he is now ahead of Trump among women and is running neck and neck with him among men. Carson's support among evangelicals has risen and he now leads Trump by more than 20 points with this group.
Carson performs well among conservative Republicans and those who identify as Tea partiers. Trump does well with moderates and leads Carson among those without a college degree - although Trump had a larger advantage with non-college graduates earlier this month.
But the state of the race can change. Seven in 10 Republican primary voters say it is too early to say for sure that their mind is made up about which candidate they will support. This percentage is about what it was at a similar point in the Republican race four years ago.
While Carson may have moved to the top of the pack, Trump's supporters are more firm in their candidate choice than Carson's. More than half of Trump voters say their minds are made up about which candidate to back, compared to 19 percent who are currently backing Carson.
Paying Attention to the Campaign
Forty-three percent of registered voters are now paying a lot of attention to the campaign - similar to earlier this month - but up from 36 percent in September. More are paying a lot of attention now, compared to this point in time in the last two presidential election cycles.
Republican voters are more likely to be tuning into the campaign than Democrats.
This poll was conducted by telephone October 21-25, 2015 among a random sample of 1,289 adults nationwide, including 1,136 registered voters. Data collection was conducted on behalf of CBS News and The New York Times by SSRS of Media, PA. Phone numbers were dialed from samples of both standard land-line and cell phones.
The poll employed a random digit dial methodology. For the landline sample, a respondent was randomly selected from all adults in the household. For the cell sample, interviews were conducted with the person who answered the phone. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish using live interviewers. The data have been weighted to reflect U.S. Census figures on demographic variables.
The error due to sampling for results based on the entire sample could be plus or minus four percentage points. The error for subgroups may be higher and is available by request. The margin of error includes the effects of standard weighting procedures which enlarge sampling error slightly.
An oversample of registered voters who are Republican was interviewed for a total of 512 interviews with Republican registered voters. The results were then weighted in proportion to the adult population. The margin of error for the Republican registered voters is 7 percentage points.
The margin of error for the sample of 575 Republican primary voters is 6 percentage points.

Esther Diaz, wife of Domingo Diego-Tapia, needs help paying for her husband's medical bills after he was placed in a medically induced coma when a man punched him off of his bicycle earlier this month. View Full Caption Courtesy of Esther Diego-Tapia
BED-STUY — Esther Diaz can't make sense of why her husband is lying in a coma, and she struggles to explain to her two young sons why their father, Domingo Diego-Tapia, can't come home.
Diaz's husband was punched off his bike by an unknown assailant nearly two weeks ago — and still, his attacker remains at large.
"I don't understand why my this happened to my husband," Diaz, 33, said through tears at a candlelight vigil Tuesday night near the Bed-Stuy intersection where her husband was hit. Flanked by politicians and bike advocates, she called for justice and prayed for her husband's recovery. "He is a loving father, and he didn't hurt anyone."
Diego-Tapia, 38, has been in a medically induced coma since the night of June 8, when a stranger punched him at random at Fulton Street and Albany Avenue as he was riding home from his job at a grocery store. He suffered a fractured skull, and has had two surgeries since the attack, according to police and family members.
The ordeal has been a financial hardship for Diaz, who told DNAinfo that for a time she was walking more than an hour each way to and from Kings County Hospital, unable to afford a taxi or a MetroCard.
On Tuesday, the family launched a GoFundMe campaign to help pay for medical expenses and Diaz's travel to and from the hospital, and the page had raised more than $3,000 by Wednesday morning.
Diaz said she had trouble at first explaining to the couple's two young sons, Pedro and Jose, why their father couldn't come home after the attack.
The boys, 7 and 5, were roughhousing on the sidewalk before the vigil began, and for a moment seemed unaware of the gravity of their father's condition. At one point, the younger boy pointed to a donation box with a picture of Diego-Tapia in his hospital bed.
"Papi is sick," he said.
Speaking at the vigil Tuesday, Borough President Eric Adams promised to personally give $1,000 to anyone who provides information that leads to an arrest.
"During this time you may feel like you are alone, but you are not alone," Adams said, "We will provide the necessary resources and services, and I'm calling on all Brooklynites to help."
Councilman Carlos Menchaca, speaking in both Spanish and English, pledged to catch the unidentified assailant.
"We will find you and we will bring you to justice," Menchaca said.
Diaz said she is also calling on immigration authorities to grant Tapia's parents a humanitarian visa so they can enter the country to see their son.
The suspect, who can be seen in police photos released Friday, is in his 20s and was last seen wearing sweatpants, sandals, a Nike baseball cap and a long-sleeved shirt with the letter "G" on the chest, police said.
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the date of the attack. It was June 8, not July 8.
America: Choosing Security Over Liberty Since 1798
In the past week, Americans have learned of a dizzying array of heretofore unrevealed surveillance programs, part of a hidden security structure ostensibly designed to prevent terrorist attacks from ever occurring on U.S. soil again. Reactions from commentators have ranged from furious outrage to reasoned concern to outright dismissal of the programs' implications. Those in the latter camp have begun to rail against former Booz Allen Hamilton contractor Edward Snowden for his release of the National Security Agency documents that have sparked a furious debate over the balance between privacy and security in the digital age; meanwhile, opponents have dismissed him as an unhinged narcissist or a sociopathic nerd.
Whether his actions are moral or justifiable is up for debate, but Snowden himself made his motivations clear in his email correspondence with Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman. In his view, America's security state has simply become too large and intrusive in the face of the relatively minor threat of terrorism. "We managed to survive greater threats in our history … than a few disorganized terrorist groups and rogue states without resorting to these sorts of programs," he told Gellman.
It's a fascinating quote. But one must wonder whether his statement — so compelling on its surface — holds true after an examination of U.S. history. Precisely when, exactly, was the period that he refers to, when a threat greater than those we face today was bravely met without any serious infringements on liberty? Was there ever such a period?
Moving backward through history, we can first quickly dispense with the last 12 years. Following 9/11, President George W. Bush's administration enacted policies that will likely become synonymous with executive overreach, the policies many of President Barack Obama's supporters are now disappointed he didn't do more to rein in. These included the National Security Agency's program of illegally wiretapping American citizens without a warrant, first revealed in 2005, which set the stage for today's concerns about whether the agency is in the habit of using its vast infrastructure to find and store every crumb of data about millions of people in the country. Muslim Americans also saw themselves the frequent victims of assaults on their civil liberties, finding themselves on the receiving end of enhanced scrutiny and frequent harassment from law enforcement.
It's equally doubtful that Snowden was thinking of the 1960s and 1970s when he spoke to Gellman. Befitting a period of social change and upheaval, many of the threats the government sought to counter during this period were internal in nature. It was also a time when U.S. security agencies, both domestic and foreign, held more power than they ever have at any point, as Congress routinely ignored its oversight responsibilities. The work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is best remembered for the harassment of civilians taking part in the civil rights movement or other activities deemed subversive. Even as lauded a peace advocate as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. found himself the target of FBI snooping, as agents gathered dirt to potentially discredit him and his movement. The FBI's Counterintelligence Program — better known as COINTELPRO — reached into the lives of people across the ideological spectrum, from the Black Panthers to the Ku Klux Klan, all in the name of protecting security.
It took Congress finally stepping in after Watergate to bring the FBI and other agencies to heel. In the course of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, better known as the Church Committee, a vast network of actions hidden from the public was exposed, ranging from the reading of Americans' mail to crackdowns on Vietnam protesters to Projects SHAMROCK and MINARET.
Under SHAMROCK, all telegraphs to and from the United States were captured as signals intelligence, regardless of their origin or destination. At the program's peak, 15,000 telegrams a month were intercepted. MINARET, meanwhile, analyzed these electronic communications and passed along information on predetermined U.S. citizens to other intelligence and law enforcement agencies for follow-up. MINARET operated from 1969 until 1973, while SHAMROCK was allowed to continue from 1945 all the way until 1975 when NSA Director Lew Allen finally shuttered it. If you were to try to design a perfect historical analogue to today's digital concerns, the activities revealed in the Church Committee's investigations would come close — with the added concern that the content of those documents were examined, rather than just logging the author and recipient before sending it on its way. (The concept of "metadata" was still a few decades away.) The committee's findings led to a series of reforms, including the passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which instituted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to provide much stricter oversight of the executive branch's actions. Unfortunately, those reforms have been chipped away at by successive administrations since then, and the FISC was responsible for authorizing the NSA's metadata collection.
Back in the 1950s, the United States faced a true existential threat in the form of the Soviet Union, and nuclear war seemed a very real possibility. In this climate, the federal government used every tool at its disposal to root out potential subversives — often bending or just outright shattering constitutional principles in the process. In an example of overreach in the legislative branch, that which is supposed to be most closely aligned with the interests of the people, the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation used the sweeping powers Congress had granted itself to conduct countless numbers of hearings into the communist threat to the homeland, including high-profile investigations of Hollywood's writers and actors and Sen. Joseph McCarthy's infamous allegations of communists throughout the government. The committees' investigations led to massive infringement on the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association.
Going back another leap takes us to World War II, before Snowden's parents were even born. During the war years, the United States massively infringed on Americans' right to privacy in ways at least as great as we see today. In the days after Pearl Harbor, the Office of Censorship was set up under the First War Powers Act, granting its director "absolute discretion" in censoring internal communications. Under this arrangement, postal censorship was put into place in the United States, with all mail that passed through the U.S. Postal Service subject to opening, inspection, and follow-up investigation. The program worked closely with the Office of Strategic Services, later to become the CIA, and was deemed necessary to prevent messages between espionage agents planted within the country from going unnoticed. The end of the war saw the creation of the NSA, the new iteration of the wartime Armed Forces Security Agency, and the institution of Projects SHAMROCK and MINARET. And in perhaps one of the most repugnant instances of violating liberty for security, thousands of Japanese-Americans were rounded up and placed into internment camps on the West Coast for the duration of the war. No charges were brought against the families moved to these camps; their relatives' country of origin was evidence enough.
And Snowden probably wouldn't have been thrilled with the U.S. activities during World War I, which saw President Woodrow Wilson and Congress come together to pass the Espionage Act of 1917 — making it a crime to interfere with military operations — and the Sedition Act of 1918, which expanded the former to criminalize any speech that cast the government or the war in a negative light and which allowed the postmaster general to refuse to deliver any mail that he personally felt would inhibit the war. (If the government prosecutes Snowden for his actions, it would likely be under the Espionage Act.) The Civil War was no triumph of liberty over security either. In fact, it saw the beginning of the modern executive consolidation of power with regard to national security. Abraham Lincoln outright suspended the writ of habeas corpus, the constitutional provision allowing for a speedy trial, to advance the war effort, something no president since then has attempted to do against U.S. citizens. Lincoln also tasked his postmaster general (then a cabinet position), Montgomery Blair, with examining mail in order to root out Confederate sympathizers. As in world wars I and II, all post was considered a legitimate target for intelligence-gathering activities.
Even the Founding Fathers, the supposed exemplars to which Americans set their gaze in times of trouble, failed on this issue. President John Adams signed into law the Sedition Act of 1798 in the face of the "Quasi-War" against France. Under this provision, the U.S. government set aside the First Amendment it had so recently penned and restricted the ability of its citizens to publish documents or give speeches seen as anti-government — all in the name of protecting the country from a threat that never materialized and that few Americans now remember.
Indeed, the truth is that we — and Snowden — do not live in an anomalous time. Rather, history is replete with instance after instance of the U.S. government suppressing or outright violating the rights of its people in the name of furthering national security. In each case, and at each point in history, we see evidence that goes against the idea of a utopian past in which freedoms and liberty went unimpeded while Americans' remained safe and protected within its borders.
This isn't at all to say that the NSA or the Obama administration should get a free pass on allowing these surveillance programs to grow and flourish under their watch. Nor is it meant to make light of the fact that the government now has the ability to copy and store the billions upon billions of pieces of information it intercepts indefinitely in databases for future use, something previous administrations could only dream of. Not nearly enough debate has gone on in the harsh light of day over just what freedoms we are willing to exchange in the name of security. But in conducting that debate, we would do well not to delude ourselves into falsely remembering a time when the United States was innocent of breaking the trust of its people in the name of protecting them. That time never existed.
It's a great time to be vegan in NYC and it's always been a great time to love pizza in NYC, so disciples of both will be pleased to hear there's a new spot to get a 'za fix without a single iota of animal. Champs Jr., the Greenpoint outpost of the popular East Williamsburg vegan diner, has been reborn as Screamers Pizzeria, the borough's first completely vegan slice joint. The pizzeria, which officially opened yesterday, is a collaboration between the Champs folks and a contingent from Blackbird Pizzeria, a vegan spot in Philly.
"There's a pretty noticeable lack of authentic New York style pizza, done vegan and done well, here in NYC," a rep for Champs said to Brokelyn, a nice jab to nearby Vinnie's Pizzeria, who are known for their vegan offerings. Co-owner Brad Baker acknowledged the competition to Brooklyn Magazine, offering that "there is no place that is just a vegan pizza by the slice."
The smallish spot will turn out classic cheese pies; a white pie with garlic oil, vegan cheese, broccoli rabe, caramelized onions and homemade almond ricotta; and their namesake "The Screamer" with garlic oil, vegan cheese, cremini and oyster mushrooms and parsley, topped with homemade almond parm, among others.
Baker says the name is a "pizza slang term" for mushrooms, because "when canned mushrooms hit the stove, all the water evaporates so they scream." Mmhm, that's definitely it.

Skin needling or percutaneous collagen induction (PCI) suing a dermal rolling device (a needling tool) is an office procedure used for managing postacne scars. The treatment of postvaricella scars and postacne scars usually requires multiple sessions. We would hereby like to report the undesirable effect of “tram tracking” with the use of this microneedling technique.
A 25‐year‐old woman with a history of varicella 3 years before and acne vulgaris for 6 years presented with multiple hyperpigmented scars on her face. The scars were predominantly depressed and rolled out; there were also some ice pick and boxcar scars. She did not have a personal or family history of keloids or hypertrophic scars.
Two sessions of microneedling were performed using a 2.0‐mm long microneedling device (Dermaroller; Dermaindia, Chennai, India). The second session was done 5 weeks after the first session. Both sessions were uneventful, and the patient had no postsession problems. She was prescribed topical mupirocin cream and sunscreen for 7 days.
One month after her second visit, she had multiple discrete papular scars in a linear pattern in the horizontal and vertical direction similar to a tram track, predominantly over the temporal area, the zygomatic arch, and the forehead (Figures 1 and 2). She was prescribed topical silicone gel, and after 6 months, there was slight improvement in the scars
Figure 1 Open in figure viewerPowerPoint Multiple discrete scars in a linear array on the cheek.
Microneedling involves a hand‐held instrument consisting of a handle with a cylinder studded with 0.5‐ to 2‐mm long stainless steel needles all around. The cylinder is rolled on the skin in multiple directions.1 During the process of microneedling, tiny wounds are created in the papillary dermis, leading to release of growth factors, which stimulate the formation of new collagen.2 The effect of microneedling has recently been explained on the basis of a demarcation current produced amongst cells when microneedles penetrate the skin, which triggers a cascade of growth factors that stimulate the healing phase.3, 4 We had used a microneedling device weighing 18 g with 192 needles. The needles were 2 mm long and spaced 2 mm apart. The second session was more aggressive than the first. The adverse effects reported included pain during the procedure, transient erythema and edema, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.3 The patient had regular patterned scarring, like tracks of criss‐crossing trams.
This kind of scarring has not been reported previously. The authors believe that this scarring could have occurred because of the use of a larger needling device or strong pressure while using the microneedling device. Hypertrophic scars and keloids are more often seen over bony prominences such as the presternal area and shoulder than other areas. Thus, the authors express caution when using microneedling devices over bony prominences and would recommend the use of needles smaller than 2.0 mm over the same.
September 26, 2014 – In an interview with journalist Abby Martin, host of RT's Breaking the Set, former Congressman Ron Paul discusses the illegal war in Syria, blowback resulting from interventionist foreign policy action and how the Tea Party was hijacked.
From the interview, Ron Paul said of the war in Syria:
“It's not legal under international law, which is important but I don't hang my hat on everything on international law as much as I do on our laws, our Constitution. I would say the whole mess that we've been involved in, with the Middle East, has been technically illegal because we've initiated war but we haven't declared war. … As a matter of fact, it's immoral in a sense that our president wanted to wind these wars down. He was going to finish the war in Iraq, and here he is, expanding it massively.”
Do you agree that our government has violated national and international law in its war in Syria and continued war in Iraq?

Minister of Science, Energy and Technology Andrew Wheatley has reaffirmed the government's full support for the principles of net neutrality.
Net neutrality principles dictate that all Internet traffic should be treated equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication, the Minister said in a release today.
The position of the Government of Jamaica is clear as it relates to net neutrality,” he said.
“We are in full support of the principles of net neutrality and as a developing economy we will apply the rules of net neutrality in a way that ensures that we meet our economic growth priorities”. Dr Wheatley said, noting that “media or telecommunications companies that do business in Jamaica must be prepared to embrace an environment that supports net neutrality.”
His statement came ahead of a pending vote today by the United States Federal Communications Commission to repeal net neutrality protections implemented under former President Barack Obama.
Dr. Wheatley opined that “there seems to be some confusion surrounding the application of net neutrality rules, where we often compare the approaches of the US and the EU to what prevails in the Caribbean.”
He said “it is important for each Caribbean nation and the region as a whole to determine how these rules work best for their economic goals and the goals of the region respectively.”
The Minister said that “as we take Jamaica towards a truly digital society and one in which we become greater creators and innovators of technology as opposed to mere consumers, it is imperative that we adopt policies that ensure that all of our local businesses and entrepreneurs grow and contribute to the development of our local and regional economies.”
While acknowledging the stated concerns of media and telecommunications operations and their belief that net neutrality may cause a reduction in investments in infrastructure and innovation in the region, Dr Wheatley called on operators to “reassess your business models and look at new ways of leveraging the investments they have made in their networks.”
He added that “in the dynamic environment that now prevails, media and telecommunications operators must also become more innovative and think outside of the box.”

A group of LEGO and The Lord of the Rings fans have managed to create an awe-inspiring LEGO version of Tolkien's Middle-Earth, spanning over 200 square feet.
The idea for this amazing project was born at BrickWorld 2010, where Chris Phipson and Mark Kelso started talking about a collaboration. After going through some ideas, and concepts, Chris said “Hey, I got it… let's do Lord of the Rings.” Obviously, Mark's reply was along the lines of “You mean like… a few of us build Minas Tirith or Barad Dur?” But his LEGO loving friend had something much bigger in mind – he wanted to recreate ALL of Middle-Earth using LEGO.
When they first heard Chris' monumental idea, most of the people involved in the project thought he was crazy, but after a bit of probing, the plan was put into action. As you can expect in a project of this magnitude, things didn't exactly go smoothly from start to finish, but what's important is many members of the LEGO building community helped out as much as they could. And, after a whole year of planning and building, the LEGO model of Middle-Earth was finally completed and showcased at BrickWorld 2011.
The awe-inspiring achievement features all of the major landmarks of Tolkien's universe, including LEGO versions of Minas Tirith, Rivendell, The Mines of Moria, Isengard, Mount Doom and the Tower of Barad Dur. While I have no idea how many bricks were used to create LEGO Middle Earth, it spanned over and area of 200 square feet. Check out some photos of the project, below, and remember to pick up your jaw off the floor, when you're done.

An Anne Arundel County Maryland cop in Baltimore to celebrate Cinco de Mayo on Tuesday bit another man's testicles during a brawl over a woman, authorities said Wednesday.
Michael Flaig, 30, was charged with assault after the fight Tuesday night in the alley behind Looney's Pub in Baltimore's South Linwood neighborhood.
According to the charging documents, Flaig had been fondling a woman when her friend and roommate, the alleged assault victim, intervened.
The alleged assault victim left on foot not long after but heard footsteps behind him. When he turned, he saw a fist coming at his face, according to court papers.
But the victim managed to dodge the punch, bring Flaig to the ground, and then straddle him, the court papers read.
Flaig struggled to escape while a second man, who police have yet to identify or arrest, punched the victim.
Unable to break free, Flaig allegedly bit the victim in the crotch and ran off.
"The bitee actually got the better of him in the fist fight. After we broke them up is when he disclosed he'd been bitten in the testicles," witness Thomas Bourne told NBC affiliate WBAL.
"He was upset, took him a long time to calm down. He indicated he needed medical assistance. He was bleeding in his area after what happened," Bourne said.
A woman approached responding officers with a description of Flaig, who had simply gone to another bar on the block.
The officers observed "Flaig had blood shot eyes, slurred words and a strong odor of (alcohol) coming from his person," according to court papers.
Flaig's police powers were suspended and he has been placed on paid administrative duty, according to Anne Arundel County Police.

Slideshow: Wildfire threatens Yosemite Jae C. Hong / AP Inmate firefighters, who are paid $1 an hour as part of California's conservation prison-camp program, work the Rim Fire threatening Yosemite. Launch slideshow
They swing the same Pulaskis, buzz the same chainsaws and face the same dangers.
But 673 of the wildland firefighters battling the ferocious blaze around Yosemite National Park have something that other hotshot crew members do not: a prison identification number.
They're part of California's conservation camp program, which takes convicts out of jail cells and puts them on the front lines of wildfires, where they earn $1 an hour cutting containment lines that keep flames from spreading.
"They are in the thick of it," said Capt. Jorge Santana of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
The agency has sent 621 men and 52 women to tackle the so-called Rim Fire, which has engulfed nearly 300 square miles of land in 12 days. More have been deployed to 20 other fires across the state.
Max Whittaker/Reuters Inmate firefighters line up for dinner at the Rim Fire camp near Buck Meadows, Calif.
"They work 24-hour shifts," Santana said. "They sleep in tents at base camp. They work side-by-side with other firefighters.
"They risk their lives."
Other states have inmate firefighters, but California's program — with 42 minimum-security camps and more than 4,100 volunteers — is the biggest and oldest, dating to 1946.
Aaron Olguin, 30, said he heard about it soon after he was sentenced to four years and four months for a drunken-driving crash in which people were injured.
Like other applicants, he underwent two weeks of punishing fitness training: grueling hikes, 9-minute mile-long runs and a regime of military-style calisthenics. Then came two weeks of job training by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
"We hiked straight up mountains with 45 pounds on our back, carrying tools and water and other necessities," he said.
Olguin got some time shaved off his sentence and spent almost three years in the program before being released last November. He estimates he worked up to 20 fires and recalled some "close calls" with falling rocks and trees at night.
"The time goes by much faster," he said. "The living conditions are way better."
Conservation camps are open to inmates serving between 12 months and 7.5 years who have not been convicted of arson, murder, kidnapping or a sexual offense. Violent crimes like robbery and carjacking are considered on a case-by-case basis.
The camps are not fenced in but CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant said there are "very few" walkaways. The inmates are given dangerous tools, like saws to cut down trees and Pulaski axes to dig up roots.
Max Whittaker/Reuters The McCain inmate crew out of San Diego struggles to cut a fire line on a steep slope on the Rim Fire near Buck Meadows, Calif.
All of them are volunteers. "We can't just force them out there like a chain-gang," Santana said.
The benefits include decent pay by prison standards: $1 an hour while fighting fires and $2 a day in the off-season, when inmates do other conservation work.
Prisoners say being in the great outdoors and the community is humanizing and an antidote to the monotony of lockup. If they behave, they can request a camp closer to their family, and they can cut their sentence by half in some cases.
The program has the lowest recidivism rate in the system, though it's still a depressing 55 percent, Santana said.
The state estimates it saves taxpayers more than $80 million a year with the cheap labor, and it's been recruiting volunteers from county lockups because of a court-ordered realignment keeping non-violent felons out of overcrowded state prisons.
"They do very laborious work," Berlant said. "It frees up our firefighters to extinguish the fires using hoses and water."
When the convicts are paroled, they leave with skills that, as the Rim Fire shows, are always in demand. Officials could not provide figures but said CalFire does hire ex-prisoners from the program.
That's Olguin's dream.
Time-lapse video from earlier this week shows the wildfire that's burned nearly 200,000 acres in California.
Since his release, he's been doing construction work in southern California, but once he gets his driver's license back, he plans to pursue a forestry job.
He never considered himself firefighter material before his conviction, so he's grateful to the camp.

"We don't get as much credit as we should, but you can't expect everything."

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. – Oct. 13, 2017 – During more than 60,000 hours of combined use of a novel artificial pancreas system, participants in a 12-week, multi-site clinical trial showed significant improvements in two key measures of well-being in people living with type 1 diabetes.
During the trial, 30 patients with type 1 diabetes in California, Virginia and Minnesota went about their normal daily routines while the artificial pancreas system continuously monitored their glucose levels and automatically adapted insulin delivery settings.
The results, published today in the journal Diabetes Care, revealed positive effects on two important indicators: decreased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and reduced time spent in hypoglycemia.
The outpatient trial was led by Frank Doyle and Eyal Dassau from the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and included collaborators at the William Sansum Diabetes Center in Santa Barbara, California; Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; the University of Virginia's Center for Diabetes Technology; and the University of Padova.
People with type 1 diabetes must vigilantly monitor blood glucose levels and, when necessary, administer doses of insulin either via needle injections or infusion pump. The artificial pancreas is designed to mimic a healthy person's glucose regulating function. The closed-loop system consists of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor placed under the user's skin. An advanced control algorithm embedded in a blue tooth-connected smart phone signals how much insulin the pump should deliver to the patient based on a range of variables including meals consumed, physical activity, sleep, stress, and metabolism.
The adaptive control algorithm system used in the trial is based on model-predictive control (MPC), a strategy originally developed by Doyle and colleagues in a seminal paper published in 1996 and, in a 2010 paper, extended to a zone-based version of the MPC algorithm. Rather than regulating glucose levels to a specific point in the same way that a home thermostat keeps the room temperature at a precise setting, zone-MPC defines an acceptable zone for an individual's glucose levels and controls variables to stay within that range. In addition to the core zone MPC algorithm, the collaborative team introduced adaptive components that allowed the algorithm to “learn” from the repeated daily cycles, leading to improvements in basal control as well as meal compensation.
“This is by far the longest duration trial we have conducted, and it is a testament to the robustness of the algorithm that our key performance indices were maintained from our earlier, shorter trials,” said Doyle, John A. Paulson Dean and John A. & Elizabeth S. Armstrong Professor of Engineering & Applied Sciences at SEAS. “Moreover, we took a disciplined group that had very good overall HbA1c levels before the trial, and we brought the group level even lower.”
The trial builds on a foundation of earlier artificial pancreas studies by Doyle and Dassau, a SEAS Senior Research Fellow, including a clinical trial earlier this year that tested the application of the algorithm on children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes during extended use of infusion set and sensor.
In addition to Doyle and Dassau, who directed and led day-to-day supervision of trial, the project team included co-principal investigators Jordan Pinsker at the William Sansum Diabetes Center; Ananda Basu at Mayo Clinic; Boris Kovatchev at the University of Virginia School of Medicine; and Cladio Cobelli of the University of Padova.

The suicide in the Friuli region of northern Italy earlier this year of a 30-year-old man, identified in the newspapers only as Michele, has become a symbol of the country's unemployment tragedy, particularly as it affects young people. Though much worse in the South, the country's economic crisis also has had a blighting effect on the North. The national unemployment rate now stands at nearly 12 percent. A 40 percent youth unemployment rate nationwide, however, has people speaking of a generational apartheid in Italy. There is no work to be found for young people. In the workplace, comparatively speaking, they have been walled off from the rest of the population.
Friuli is a region of plain and mountain in the northeastern part of Italy, flush against borders to the north with Austria and the east with Slovenia. The annals of Friuli antedate by many centuries the arrival of the ancient Romans, who founded the colony of Aquileia there nearly two hundred years before Christ. The barbarian invasions swept over Friuli in the general wreckage of the Roman Empire. An Aquileian state arose in the Middle Ages, but was absorbed in the 15th century by the expanding Venetian empire. Then Friuli passed through French and Austrian phases of occupation and control before becoming part the newly founded Kingdom of Italy, in 1866.
The Friulani, a highly energetic and resourceful people steeped in the work ethic common to the peasant and artisanal cultures of traditional Europe, tilled the land and also gained a well-deserved reputation for their skill in specialty crafts and the building trades. Typically in such cultures, the work that a man did define him. The modern world has changed those old ways of life, but the culture they generated persists. More recently, Friuli became renowned for its small businesses and factories, which played a vital role in the national economy. There was still hard work for the Friulani to do.
From his mother's milk, Michele would have imbibed the work ethic of his native region. He would have thought of work as dignity and honor. In a suicide note, he claimed to be bereft of such things and of hope. “Desire has passed me by,” he wrote. Michele never had been able to find a meaningful job and had despaired of ever finding one. Contemplating his blank future, a sense of deep frustration had crushed his spirit. He hoped that his parents would forgive his dreadful act, but could not envisage a place for himself in a society without work.

No less than many other regions in the country, Friuli has been devastated by the economic crash of 2008 and its seemingly permanent aftermath. Hundreds of its small businesses and factories have closed, leaving many thousands unemployed. Michele's father called his son's death “the defeat of a moribund society.” What other way is there to describe a society unable to create work for its young people?
One of Italy's rising political figures, Beppe Grillo of the politically eclectic Five-Star Movement, has proposed a guaranteed citizen income for all Italians. His reasoning appears to be that the Italians should be getting something from their government other than its slavish devotion to the corrupt oligarchy of the banks and corporations that rule the country.
There is a strong Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein component in the Five-Star Movement, as well as an admiration for the challenge that Hugo Chávez threw down to the multinationals in Venezuela. Grillo also has praised Ecuador's Rafael Correa for his opposition to the International Monetary Fund, an institution that the Italian leader reviles as a battering ram of noxious austerity policies. Since the recent presidential election in the United States, Grillo has praised Trump as a much-needed change-of-air in world politics. Change of any kind, a powerful sentiment in the United States last fall, exerts the same kind of force in Italy now.
Even if a guaranteed citizen income initiative were to prevail and become law, the main problem underscored by Michele's death would still remain. An allowance conjures up the image of juvenile dependence. A national welfare program for all citizens certainly is preferable to leaving ever rising numbers of them in want, but it would not solve in a socially edifying way the anterior problem of work. Michele was not asking for an allowance. He wanted work to do. This is a human need that societies deserving of survival are obliged to supply, a point raised by Thorstein Veblen in the book of his he valued most, The Instinct of Workmanship (1914). Human beings, he wrote, are called by nature to useful effort. It is not only the deprivations and frustrations associated with sex that undermine and subvert the human personality. He judged the men who live by moving money around to be the greatest peril of all to those who live by work.
The problem of work in Italy today belongs to the class of social consequences identified by Pier Paolo Pasolini in a famous Corriere della Sera article in 1974. “The Italians are no longer what they once were,” he observed. By this statement, Friuli's greatest poet, filmmaker, and social critic meant that Italy's traditional values had undergone an anthropological mutation. The country had abandoned its traditional way of life, which in its peasant culture had achieved a kind of poetic synthesis in the saying of Padron ‘Ntoni, novelist Giovanni Verga's lead character in I Malavoglia (1881): “He is richest who has the fewest wants.” Pasolini feared that the new values of a hedonistic consumer society would be a poor substitute for Italy's Christian and socialist ideals. What a debased fate for Italy, to come through the civilization-defining vicissitudes of its millennial history, only to end up ignobly aping American-style conspicuous consumption.
Pasolini had in mind a particular phase of the globalized economy, which since the 1970s has sped forward on the principle that money must be completely liberated to maximize profits for those who have it. It is immediately evident why this golden rule for today's economy, though achieving its purpose of profit-maximization, has been a poor proposition for most of the working people of the Western world.
While rates of extreme poverty worldwide have declined in recent decades, the means to produce such a result have required an outsourcing of the West's manufacturing base. The coincidental surge in profits made possible by the relocation of manufacturing jobs to countries unencumbered by high wages, labor unions, and environmental laws has with perfect justice sparked a political firestorm.
Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz explained in Globalization and Its Discontents (2004) that the basic problem with the world's current financial arrangement concerned the institutions and organizations commanding it. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the U.S. Treasury, and the European Monetary Union protect special interests, Wall Street most of all. Despite their lip-service in democratic argot, the very last thing seriously on the minds of the top financial policymakers is the well-being of ordinary people.
As a result of the methods used to promote globalization, the consequences for the West have been tragic. Work is becoming increasingly uncertain and insecure, or it is in the process of disappearing altogether. It would take Veblen's talents for social satire, which are unsurpassed in all of American literature, to depict with the essential exactitude of artistic synthesis how far the United States has fallen away from democratic grace, the country's dramatically widening gap between the haves and the have-nots being what it is. Clearly, we are on the wrong course. What the robotics revolution, now at an incipient stage, will do to further diminish opportunities for Western peoples to work can be easily imagined, if the economic imperative of corporate capitalism is the rule to go by.
The same desolating trends can be seen in Europe, where people increasingly regard the European Union as a Trojan horse. The economic elites and their political front-men responsible for this image-challenged contraption lose public support with each new poll. The people by and large blame the European Union and the other accessories of globalization for their worsening standard of living. When informed by the establishment media that thanks to globalization Europe has never been more prosperous and peaceful, Europeans in historic numbers are reacting with disbelief. Their deepening sense of betrayal propels the surge of populism that defines the politics of Europe today.
Arguments long-settled in favor of deregulation, liberalization, open borders, and other globalization watchwords have been reopened. The constituency is growing for a politics that puts the well-being of Europeans first. Political measures calling for the protection of European jobs and cultures have gained a following unforeseen prior to 2008.
In Italy, for example, 77 percent of the people questioned in a recent poll could see no advantage to them at all from the country's membership in the European Union. Sixty-four percent of them expressed hostility toward it. Eight Italian businesses out of 10 can find nothing positive to say about the European Union. It is seen to be a creature of the banks and the big financial houses. As public relations disasters go, this one has unfolded on an epic scale as the underlying populations, long left out of consideration by the economic elites, have begun to sense the fate their masters have in store for them.
Leaving underlying populations out of consideration was a special feature of the planning that went into globalization. They have been voiceless. In America, Trump gave them a voice, and they responded to him with their political support. It did not matter that he came before them without a plan for their deliverance. That he came to them at all mattered. He understood the depth of the anger and alienation in America against a status quo personified by his opponent, Hillary Clinton, whose repeated and munificently rewarded speeches before the captains of finance on Wall Street effectively branded her as the safe candidate for all who wanted to leave existing economic arrangements fundamentally undisturbed.
Trump may go down in history as a president who was hopelessly out of his depth on all vital matters, but his presidential campaign will be studied for as long as historians have an interest in American politics. It was a masterpiece of intuition based on an uncannily correct judgment about the spirit of the times. Bernie Sanders had the same insight, but the Democratic Party turned out to be much more corrupt and vulnerable to manipulation than the Republicans, an astonishing feat. In possibly an even more flagrant instance of interference in the American democratic process than anything yet proven against Vladimir Putin, internal machinations weighted the primary process against Sanders. The Republicans tried to head off Trump, too, but a fiercely loyal base and a dearth of plausible opponents gave him an easy victory in the primaries.
At an academic conference in New York in May a year ago, I participated in a conversation among scholars, journalists, and government officials who generally thought that Trump would not even win 20 percent of the national vote. His ridiculous campaign surely would fall of its own dead weight. Professional pollsters, though not so far wrong as my conference colleagues in New York, also missed what appears to be the main story of the campaign: a loss of faith, unprecedented in its severity, by the American people in the rules of the game. There is no other way to explain the stunningly bizarre choice that they made for the man to lead them.
That Trump has rapt admirers and self-confessed imitators in Europe should come as no surprise because the mood he represents is an international phenomenon. Virtually every European country has a Trump candidate saying basically the same things that he did in his campaign against immigrants, globalization trade agreements, and the establishment media. Italy has two such candidates: Grillo and the leader of the xenophobic League Party, Matteo Salvini. They are riding a wave of anti-establishment outrage and in tandem are outpolling the two major mainstream parties, the center-left Democratic Party, now in internal disarray from schism, and the center-right Go Italy Party.
As Europe since the end of World War II has slipped ever more securely into the orbit of American military and economic power, it is only to be expected that the Atlantic Community will be increasingly homogeneous. The Italian case is most instructive about the fundamental meaning of America for Europe. Italy's greatest postwar novelist, Cesare Pavese, explained in The Moon and the Bonfires (1950), “America is here already. We have our millionaires and people are dying of hunger.” Contemporary Italy, in keeping with Europe as a whole, is best understood as an example of America's role as the prime mover in international affairs and economics, or of how the world works per necessità, in Machiavelli's phrase, according to the dictates of those who hold irresistible power.
By outsourcing its manufacturing base in search of portfolio enhancement, the United States exercised freedom for which liberty-loving European businessmen, bankers, and politicians hungered as well. Unable to compete with 50-cent per hour labor, the working classes in America and Europe would have to go to the wall, but while adjusting their blindfolds they could rest assured that in the fullness of time the wonder-working ways of the free market would redeem the world.
Such a promise held no meaning for Michele, and he left this world slamming the door. “I feel betrayed,” he wrote in his suicide note. Who can say which other factors drove him in those last desperate hours before he took his life? We do know what his stated reason was for doing it. Work was the final thought that he had. How else could a Friulano give a good account of himself in this life?
Tasting Notes:
Czech Pils – The light crackery malt sweetness is subtle beneath the spicy and floral hop character. A thin layer of white foam rests atop the cloudy, pale gold brew. The hop flavors are bold and reminiscent of grapefruit on the forefront and a lingering spice. Yolo's Czech Pils has a light body and a slight carbonic bite.
Golden Weizen – This brew has aromas of tangerine and subdued floral qualities. These mingle with mild bready malt sweetness. This is a murky, deep yellow with no head present in the sample glass. The soft bready malt character is balanced with tangerine and bubble gum flavors. This light bodied American styled Hefeweizen is smooth and very easy drinking but has little to no carbonation.
S.M.A.S.H. IPA – This Single Malt And Single Hop (S.M.A.S.H.) IPA was made with only Pale 2-row barley and Mosaic hops. This is a danky beer with notes of peach, pear and mild bready malt sweetness. The slightly hazy, light amber ale was capped with a thin sheet of off-white foam. The cannabis quality noted in the aroma is paired with grapefruit and a lingering pine that is set against the bready malt spine. This version of the S.M.A.S.H. IPA has a medium body, moderate carbonation and a dry finish.
Captain Ron's – This 2XIPA is a hop bomb, with an aroma that suggests lemon drops and apricot. Also noted in the nose is a strong malt backbone. The off-white foam is thick and formed of fine bubbles that cling to the glass. The flavor is redolent with resinous pine and citrus hop character that is supported by the sweet malt backbone. This brew is chest warming and has a medium body and a sweet finish.
Oatmeal Stout – Served on nitro, this beer is reminiscent of breakfast with aromas of coffee and toast. These aromas are rounded off with chocolate and a mild earthy hop character. The opaque black ale is crowned with a beige head that lingers. The flavor follows the nose spot on. Its medium-full body combined with it being served on nitro made for quite a smooth beverage.
Hello? Is the fashion lover of the house available? Because this week, we've got quite the style showdown between '80s rocker Cyndi Lauper and pop tart Katy Perry in the same whimsical dress featuring a London phone booth. The ladies, who are both known for their frequent hair-color changes and their quirky wardrobes, chose identical versions of Moschino Cheap & Chic's printed crepe mini dress. Lauper once prided herself on being different, naming her 1983 debut album She's So Unusual, and Perry has made it clear with fashions like her whip cream-spewing bra and a glow-in-the-dark dress that she likes to stand out from the crowd herself. So which one of them really owned this look? Time for us to decide ... who wore it best?!

Perry, 27, donned the frock for dinner with friends in England's capital city last October. The "Wide Awake" singer further flaunted her fun sense of style by adding a classic trench coat, dark tights, a beanie, and black flats. As Perry once told the British morning TV show "Daybreak," her current style of high-fashion dresses mixed with trendy and sometimes funky pieces comes from her younger years, when she wasn't so financially successful. "I wanted to be unique but I had no means," Perry said. "I started going to charity shops, and vintage shops, and whatever I could get with the money that I made while playing the guitar on the street, that's what I bought and I cultivated this very interesting somewhat embarrassing style at times."

Lauper, 59, took her turn in the dress last month at a book store in NYC. She wore it with big gold earrings, a black leather jacket, and tall black boots as she promoted her book simply titled, Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir. The "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" singer's Big Apple adventures also recently included a performance at the 70th birthday bash for her designer pal Betsey Johnson. It only makes sense that they'd be friends, right?

While both women were able to fulfill their quirky quotient with this design, I think it's clear that one of them wore it better. On top of the splashy dress, Perry's many accessories and pink hair were a little too much for a casual night out. Lauper, however, kept the rest of her look rocker chic. (She's come so far since she dressed like the '80s version of Ke$ha!) For me, Lauper takes the crown — that's no doubt flashing neon lights. Do you agree?

Clergy defend asking parishioners to donate £5,000 each to church projects BelfastTelegraph.co.uk The importance of parishioners making donations to church projects has been defended by Northern Ireland clergy after a Catholic parish in Belfast called for people to make a contribution of £5,000 each. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/clergy-defend-asking-parishioners-to-donate-5000-each-to-church-projects-31139871.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article31139869.ece/e8bca/AUTOCROP/h342/2015-04-14_new_8593598_I1.JPG

The importance of parishioners making donations to church projects has been defended by Northern Ireland clergy after a Catholic parish in Belfast called for people to make a contribution of £5,000 each.
Mass-goers at Holy Family in the north of the city received a letter suggesting a contribution of £1,000 each year for the next five years to help reduce the body's £1.7m debts.
The debt comes from building a new church on the Limestone Road and maintenance of the parish's two other churches, St Therese of Lisieux and the Church of the Resurrection, which is now closed and in disrepair.
The letter said: "Potentially, 100 such pledges, whether by individual parishioners or households, could reduce parish debt by more than one-third within five years."
The missive also explained that the donation request for the initiative, which was said to have come from a parishioner last November, would be over and above existing financial support. It added that more modest sums were also welcome.
Holy Family administrator Fr Paul Strain said several parishioners have already signed up for the pledge. He said: "Bearing in mind the financial constraints upon families at this time, whilst the pledge amount of £5,000 is suggested, individuals or groups are at liberty to consider making some other level of contribution to this debt reduction initiative."
The case is the latest example of how much churches rely on the generosity of their congregation in times of need.
Six years ago, Orangefield Presbyterian Church on the Castlereagh Road in Belfast had a £3.7m refurbishment from donations gathered from members.
This paid for the upgrading of the church building to meet modern requirements, and a new suite of halls, plus a cafe and a pre-school nursery. Orangefield's adminis​​tration facilities manager David Irvine said donations of money and time were vital.
"These projects are specifically looking for community outreach," he said. "Donations are essential, not only in terms of financial contributions but also the aspect of keeping church life going."
Some smaller churches may ask their members to pay a tithe or a percentage of their income into their church to fund it.
Eric Marshall, the treasurer at St Patrick's Church of Ireland Cathedral in Armagh, said donations were vital even for larger denominations.
He said: "We have a small congregation and they are very faithful. Their generous offerings meet day-to-day expenses."
Belfast Telegraph religious affairs correspondent Alf McCreary said: "Some people may feel aggrieved at the level of donations being asked for in these tough economic times, but it's also tough for the churches, with rising maintenance and running costs as well as trying to build new facilities."
Background
Members of Orangefield Presbyterian Church funded a £3.7m project to upgrade the church building, a new suite of halls, a cafe and a pre-school nursery. Parishioners of St Elizabeth Church of Ireland in Dundonald recently made financial contributions through special events to help build a new entrance pavilion and hall. There has been refurbishment work to Catholic churches across Northern Ireland, funded by the lottery, rent from lands and mainly parishioners. This includes St Anne's and St Patrick's in Derriaghy. There is ongoing work to the spire and facade at St Patrick's in Donegall Street, Belfast and a new porch at St Joseph's in Kircubbin.
Belfast Telegraph
Dizocilpine (INN), also known as MK-801, is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-Methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a glutamate receptor, discovered by a team at Merck in 1982.[1] Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. The channel is normally blocked with a magnesium ion and requires depolarization of the neuron to remove the magnesium and allow the glutamate to open the channel, causing an influx of calcium, which then leads to subsequent depolarization.[2] Dizocilpine binds inside the ion channel of the receptor at several of PCP's binding sites thus preventing the flow of ions, including calcium (Ca2+), through the channel. Dizocilpine blocks NMDA receptors in a use- and voltage-dependent manner, since the channel must open for the drug to bind inside it.[3] The drug acts as a potent anti-convulsant and likely has dissociative anesthetic properties, but it is not used clinically for this purpose due to the discovery of brain lesions, called Olney's lesions (see below), in lab rats. Dizocilpine is also associated with a number of negative side effects, including cognitive disruption and psychotic-spectrum reactions. It also inhibited the induction of long term potentiation.[4] Instead, the NMDA receptor pore-blocker ketamine is used as a dissociative anesthetic in human medical procedures. While ketamine may also trigger temporary psychosis in certain individuals, its short half-life and lower potency make it a much safer clinical option. However, dizocilpine is the most frequently used non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist in animal models to mimic psychosis for experimental purposes.
Dizocilpine has also been found to act as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist.[5][6][7] It has been shown to bind to and inhibit the serotonin and dopamine transporters as well.[8][9]
An animal model of schizophrenia [ edit ]
Dizocilpine has a great deal of potential to be used in research in creating animal models of schizophrenia. Unlike dopaminergic agonists, which mimic only the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, a single injection of dizocilpine was successful in modelling both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.[10] Another study found that, although repeated low doses of dizocilpine were only successful in mimicking behavioral changes such as a slight hyperlocomotion and decreased prepulse inhibition, repeated administration of a higher dose mimicked both the above changes and the neurochemical alterations found in first-episode schizophrenic patients.[11] Not only has temporary use been shown to mimic psychosis but chronic administration in laboratory animals resulted in similar neuropathological changes as in schizophrenia.[12]
Possible future medical uses [ edit ]
The effects of dizocilpine at NMDA receptors are clear and significant. NMDA receptors are key in the progression of excitotoxicity (a process in which an excessive amount of extracellular glutamate overexcites glutamate receptors and harms neurons). Thus NMDA receptor antagonists including dizocilpine have been extensively studied for use in treatment of diseases with excitotoxic components, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Dizocilpine has shown effectiveness in protecting neurons in cell culture and animal models of excitotoxic neurodegeneration.[13][14][15] The administration of dizocilpine protected the hippocampus from ischemia-induced neurodegeneration in the gerbil. The ED 50 (effective dose 50) for neuroprotection was 0.3 mg/kg and the majority of the animals were protected against the ischemia-induced damage at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg, when dizocilpine was given one hour prior to the occlusion of the carotid arteries, although other studies have shown protection up to 24 hours post-insult. Excitatory amino acids, such as glutamate and aspartate, are released in toxic amounts when the brain is deprived of blood and oxygen and NMDA receptors are thought to prevent the neurodegeneration through the inhibition of these receptors.[16][17]
Behavioural studies have shown that NMDA receptors are involved in the development of psychological dependence caused by chronic administration of morphine. Dizocilpine suppressed the morphine-induced rewarding effect. It is suggested that stimulating NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor and its associated kinases in the nucleus accumbens leads to the rewarding effect caused by morphine. Inhibition of this receptor and its kinases in the nucleus accumbens by co-treatment with NMDA antagonists prevents morphine-associated psychological dependence.[18] An earlier study has shown that the prevention of morphine-associated psychological dependence was not due to state-dependency effects induced by dizocilpine[19] but rather reflect the impairment of learning that is caused by NMDA antagonists.[20] This is consistent with studies showing that dizocilpine potentiates the addictive potential of morphine and other drugs (see below).
As an antidepressant, positive results were found in animal models of depression.[21] NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have been shown in animal models to attenuate the hearing loss caused by aminoglycosides It is thought that aminoglycosides mimic endogenous polyamines at NMDA receptors and produce excitotoxic damage, leading to hair cell loss. Antagonizing NMDA receptors to reduce the excitotoxicity would prevent that hearing loss.[22][23] Dizocilpine was found to block the development of kindled seizures, although it does not have any effect on completed kindled seizures.[24] Oddly, it was discovered to decrease rabies virus production and is believed to be the first neurotransmitter antagonist to present with antiviral activity. Rat cortical neuron cells were infected with the rabies virus and those incubated with dizocilpine had virus produced reduced about 1000-fold. It is not known how MK-801 has this effect; the rabies virus suspension, without cells, was inoculated with dizocilpine and the drug failed to produce a virucidal effect, indicated that the mechanism of action is something other than direct discontinuation of virus reproduction. It was also tested against herpes simplex, vesicular stomatitis, poliovirus type I, and human immunodeficiency virus. It did not have activity against these other viruses, however.[25] Dizocilpine was also shown to potentiate the ability of levodopa to ameliorate akinesia and muscular rigidity in a rodent model of parkinsonism.[26] When dizocilpine was administered to rats 15 minutes after a spinal trauma, the long-term neurological recovery of the trauma was improved.[27] However, NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have largely failed to show safety in clinical trials, possibly due to inhibition of NMDA receptor function that is necessary for normal neuronal function. Since dizocilpine is a particularly strong NMDA receptor antagonist, this drug is particularly likely to have psychotomimetic side effects (such as hallucinations) that result from NMDA receptor blockade. Dizocilpine had a promising future as a neuroprotective agent until neurotoxic-like effects, called Olney's Lesions, were seen in certain brain regions of lab rats.[28][29] Merck, a drug company, promptly dropped development of dizocilpine.
Olney's lesions [ edit ]
Dizocilpine, along with other NMDA antagonists, induce the formation of brain lesions first discovered by John W. Olney in 1989. Dizocilpine leads to the development of neuronal vacuolization in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex.[28] Other neurons in the area expressed an abnormal amount of heat shock protein[30] as well as increased glucose metabolism[31] in response to NMDA antagonist exposure. Vacuoles began to form within 30 minutes of a subcutaneous dose of dizocilpine 1 mg/kg.[32] Neurons in this area necrotized and were accompanied by a glial response involving astrocytes and microglia.[33]
Recreational use [ edit ]
Dizocilpine may be effective as a recreational drug. Little is known in this context about its effects, dosage, and risks. The high potency of dizocilpine makes its dosage more difficult to accurately control when compared to other similar drugs. As a result, the chances of overdosing are high. Users tend to report that the experience is not as enjoyable as other dissociative drugs, and it is often accompanied by strong auditory hallucinations. Also, dizocilpine is much longer-lasting than similar dissociative drugs such as ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP), and causes far worse amnesia and residual deficits in thinking, which have hindered its acceptance as a recreational drug.[citation needed] Several animal studies have demonstrated the addictive potential of dizocilpine. Rats learned to lever-press in order to obtain injections of dizocilpine into the nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex, however, when given a dopamine antagonist at the same time, the lever-pressing was not altered, which shows that the rewarding effect of dizocilpine is not dependent on dopamine.[34] Intraperitoneal administration of dizocilpine also produced an enhancement in self-stimulation responding.[35] Rhesus monkeys were trained to self-administer cocaine or phencyclidine, then were offered dizocilpine instead. None of the four monkeys who were used to cocaine chose to self-administer dizocilpine but three out of the four monkeys who had been using phencyclidine self-administered dizocilpine, suggesting again that dizocilpine has potential as a recreational drug for those seeking a dissociative anaesthetic type of experience.[36] It was found that dizocilpine administration elicited conditioned place preference in animals, again demonstrating its reinforcing properties.[37][38]
A multiple drug fatality involving dizocilpine, benzodiazepines, and alcohol has been reported.[39]
Synthesis [ edit ]
Dizocilpine is made from dibenzosuberenone starting material.[40]

County councilman charged
Faces 23 criminal counts in misuse of widow's trust fund
The Allegheny County councilman accused nearly two years ago of improperly making $40,000 in political contributions from an elderly widow's trust fund has been charged with 23 criminal counts, including theft, misapplication of property, criminal conspiracy and making false reports.
Charles P. McCullough, who was elected in 2007 after some of the allegations had come to light, was arrested yesterday and released on $20,000 straight bond.
Also charged was Mr. McCullough's sister, Kathleen, who is named in relation to the trust account in the jury presentment. She also was charged in a separate embezzlement case.
According to the 52-page grand jury presentment, Mr. McCullough is accused of taking more than $154,000 from Shirley Jordan's trust.
Mr. McCullough's attorney, Clifford Levine, said his client has no intentions of stepping down from County Council.
"He feels very strongly that he is innocent of the charges, and we will fight them vigorously," Mr. Levine said.
Yesterday, County Executive Dan Onorato called it "a sad day for council."
A number of Mr. McCullough's colleagues on the 15-member council said they will withhold their judgment about his future on County Council until the case against him is settled.
"It's a sad thing that this would occur. I feel bad for his family, but this is uncharted water for us. We have never had to deal with a situation like this," said Council President Rich Fitzgerald, D-Squirrel Hill.
The investigation involves Mr. McCullough's handling of the trust account of Mrs. Jordan, a 91-year-old widow in Upper St. Clair. The investigation began in April 2007, following the publication of a story in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette revealing that Mrs. Jordan had been the single largest donor to four local Republican candidates even though she hadn't voted in seven years.
Mrs. Jordan, who resides in nursing home, told the Post-Gazette in an interview that she never approved the $40,000 in donations. She attributed the checks to her attorney, Mr. McCullough, who had power of attorney over her financial affairs and represented her in her trust fund.
"'He's a dirty crook, if you want my opinion,'" Mrs. Jordan told a detective investigating the case.
As for the $40,000 in political donations Mrs. Jordan claimed not to have made, Mr. Levine said: "There are explanations for a number of matters, and we'll present those at the appropriate time."
But according to the grand jury, Mr. McCullough had his secretary modify the donation checks from Mrs. Jordan's account to include the words: "Shirley H. Jordan care of Charles P. McCullough."
Officials say another $10,000 donation -- this one without Mr. McCullough's name on it -- was made to Catholic Charities at the last minute to ensure the organization met its fund-raising goals. Mr. McCullough's wife was the executive director of the charity at the time.
Court papers accuse Mr. McCullough -- who met Mrs. Jordan in his capacity as solicitor for Upper St. Clair during a dispute with her over installing sidewalks in front of her home -- of inappropriately using a power of attorney dated Feb. 15, 2006.
The document states that Mr. McCullough would be permitted to act on Mrs. Jordan's behalf should she "be incapacitated."
However, the grand jury found that Mrs. Jordan, at the times in question, was not incapacitated
The form, which an expert before the grand jury called "scissors and paste job," goes on to say that Mr. McCullough, as her agent, "shall not receive compensation for serving under this power of attorney."
But, the grand jury found that he collected money for "personal agency" fees, legal fees and for services rendered. He charged the trust account, which was at the time being administered by PNC Bank, $4,000 per month.
Thomas Gray, a relationship manager at PNC, testified that Mr. McCullough made a number of unusual requests and suggestions on how Mrs. Jordan's money should be spent, including one to use $500,000 to buy a piece of real estate from one of Mr. McCullough's clients. The bank refused to allocate the money.
Eventually, the trust fund was moved to Northwest Savings Bank at Mr. McCullough's request, according to the grand jury. There the presentment says, administrators did not question the attorney's spending requests.
The grand jury also concluded that Mr. McCullough set out, with attorneys from his then-law firm, Eckert Seamans, to establish a foundation in Mrs. Jordan's name, even though her will specify that that was to occur only upon her death.
"This grand jury finds that the overriding reason McCullough initiated the startup and funding of the Jordan Foundation during Shirley Jordan's lifetime was to ensure his own control of her assets," court papers say.
Upon Mrs. Jordan's death, Mr. McCullough's power of attorney would have ended.
The grand jury found that Mr. McCullough, who charged about $300 per hour for his foundation work, billed for nearly $15,000 in legal fees. Another $79,000 was billed to the firm.
In detailing how the foundation was set up, the grand jury explained that Mr. McCullough recruited a number of people to serve on the advisory board, including former county Executive Jim Roddey.
Mr. Roddey testified to the grand jury that Mr. McCullough offered to pay sitting members $1,000 per meeting.
"'I felt that the amount was excessive,'" Mr. Roddey said, noting that the board's make-up included only Republicans. "'I just had a very uncomfortable feeling about checks from her trust of this magnitude going to people that normally would not receive that kind of largess.'"
The charges against Mr. McCullough for making false reports to law enforcement stem from the initial story written on the matter.
Five days after the article ran in the Post-Gazette, Mr. McCullough went to the Upper St. Clair police and filed a complaint against reporter Dennis Roddy, who wrote the initial story.
Upper St. Clair Police Chief Ronald J. Pardini testified to the grand jury that Mr. McCullough alleged that Mr. Roddy had agitated Mrs. Jordan, forcing her to hide in a bathroom, and requiring her caretaker to run and get help. Mr. McCullough also said that Mr. Roddy failed to identify himself as a reporter or sign in to the nursing home.
However, a police investigation determined those allegations were not true.
The grand jury specifically noted in the presentment that some good has come of the investigation and the initial article.
All of the political contributions and money donated to Catholic Charities have been returned. In addition, Mr. McCullough returned $40,000 paid to him for services he rendered, and Eckert Seamans returned all of the fees it had been paid and forgave any outstanding bills.
The allegations involving Kathleen McCullough, 46, of Collier, revolve around her being hired to serve as a companion to Mrs. Jordan at a rate of $60 per hour, even though she had no medical background or geriatric certification. She was paid $4,575 to spend time with the elderly woman for July and August 2006. Included in that fee were additional services where Ms. McCullough charged $120 for going out to purchase birthday gifts for Mrs. Jordan and for $360 for spending six hours wrapping gifts and attending the woman's party.
Testimony during the grand jury proceedings revealed that the typical pay rate for such a companion would be $14.78.
Ms. McCullough is also charged with theft by deception for allegedly taking $1.25 million from her former employer, Mackin Engineering. Court documents show that during the investigation involving Shirley Jordan, detectives discovered evidence at Ms. McCullough's home related to her former job.
According to the grand jury presentment, Ms. McCullough, who was the controller, wrote checks from Mackin totaling $872,118 to pay her American Express card. She rang up $47,000 worth of charges at Polo Retail in just one month in 2005, authorities said. In that month, her purchases exceeded $94,000, police said
However, Ms. McCullough's attorney, Steven Townsend, said that it's "preposterous" she could have run up $800,000 in expenses on her credit card.
"She's done nothing wrong here," he said. "These expenses can all be justified."
She is already facing separate counts alleging that she embezzled $148,000 from Radiance Surgery Center.

Long-running Venice Beach, California thrash/punk band SUICIDAL TENDENCIES has released the following statement:
"It's with complete sadness that we have to announce the passing of bassist Tim 'Rawbiz' Williams.
"Tim played bass for SUICIDAL TENDENCIES for almost four years until recently.
"Tim was a monster on bass, running around on stage in the pit, giving his all, even when his body wasn't at its best. We will always remember him and appreciate all the kind words by those that were touched by his bass playing and him personally."
Williams is credited with playing bass on only one song on SUICIDAL TENDENCIES' latest album, "13", which came out in March 2013. The first studio CD in 13 years from SUICIDAL TENDENCIES sold around 3,200 copies in the United States in its first week of release to debut at position No. 187 on The Billboard 200 chart.
In addition to playing with SUICIDAL TENDENCIES since 2011, Williams has worked with everyone from Toni Braxton to BOYZ II MEN to Keyshia Cole. According to Billboard, he also appeared on Sean "Diddy" Combs' 2009 reality show "Making His Band", which documented the hip-hop mogul's search for Diddy's backing group.
This week Quentin Tarantino decided to sue Gawker after the site published a link to the filmmaker's leaked 'The Hateful Eight' script. In an attempt to make the screenplay harder to find the filmmaker also asked Google to remove several websites that linked to or wrote about it. Thus far, however, the search engine is refusing to comply.
When Quentin Tarantino found out that copies of the script of his new movie ‘The Hateful Eight' were circulating online, he decided to cancel the movie.
Then, on Monday after Gawker published links to copies of the 146-page screenplay, things took a turn for the worse. The filmmaker was outraged by Gawker's move and filed a lawsuit claiming that the blog was facilitating copyright infringement.
“Their headline boasts ‘Here Is the Leaked Quentin Tarantino Hateful Eight Script' – ‘Here,' not someplace else, but ‘Here' on the Gawker website,” the complaint states.
“The article then contains multiple direct links for downloading the entire screenplay through a conveniently anonymous URL by simply clicking button links on the Gawker page, and brazenly encourages Gawker visitors to read the Screenplay illegally with the invitation to ‘Enjoy!' it.”
In addition to filing a lawsuit, Tarantino also took steps to remove links to numerous copies and references to the leaked script from Google.
Several DMCA notices were sent to Google on behalf of the director, targeting the Gawker article as well as several other forum posts and news articles. Tarantino claims that the URLs in question are infringing on his copyrights, but Google sees things differently.
Of the 29 URLs Tarantino wants to have removed, Google took action for only a handful. The links that were disabled include copies of the leaked script on torrent sites and the file-hosting site Anonfiles.
The news articles, blog posts and forum threads, however, remained online.
The Gawker article Tarantino sued over, for example, is still listed in the search results. Google's Transparency Report also points out that “no action” was taken to remove the URL in question.
Google's “no action” in response to Tarantino
TF asked Google to explain why the Gawker page hasn't been removed, but we have yet to hear back from them. It is worth pointing out that the copies of the screenplay that are linked from article have since been removed from Scribd and Anonfiles, so the article isn't “infringing” anymore.
That said, Google also refused to remove links to other articles, which still have excerpts and screenshots of the leaked Hateful Eight script.
It is safe to say that the search engine is clearly taking a stand here, perhaps in part to protect their own interests. If the case against Gawker goes ahead, it is likely that Google will get involved to prevent a damaging precedent.
After all, the search engine is linking to millions of infringing files itself. Unlike Gawker, Google's links are added to the search engine automatically, but a ruling on the issue is likely to have a broader effect.
Mérida, 31st January 2013 (Venezuelanalysis.com) – Venezuela's LGBT movement today gathered outside the National Assembly to hand over a legal proposal for debate that would legalise same-sex civil marriage in the South American country.
Some 300 activists representing 47 social organisations met for the occasion, where they presented the proposal which has so far received over 21,000 signatures in support.
The movement aims to change article 44 of Venezuelan civil law, the only legal obstacle to same-sex civil marriage, so that it describes marriage as “the union of two people without gender distinction”.
“Enough of patriarchy and them telling us what to do, equal marriage is what the Assembly has to do,” activists chanted.
Some activists were optimistic that same-sex marriage could soon be a reality in Venezuela, which would join Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and the Mexican Federal District in approving such a measure.
The movement, led by the Equal Venezuela Civil Association (ACVI), has so far received the support of at least four socialist party (PSUV) parliamentary deputies, as well as two PSUV state governors, several government ministers and the comptroller general. Some members and groups of the opposition are also in favour.
However the Venezuelan Catholic Church is opposed to the measure, and many evangelical churches are also considered to be against the proposal.
Other same-sex marriage activists fear that patriarchal and traditional religious influences will make it difficult to win a vote in the 165-member National Assembly in the near future.
“There are political and evangelical-religious fundamentalist sectors in the National Assembly, a radiography would need to be done to know who would really support it. We at least hope that a serious debate is held,” activist Cesar Sequera told AFP.
Under Venezuela's “People Legislator” law movements can introduce draft legislation to the National Assembly if they gain enough signatures, which must then be debated by assembly deputies.
This is it, the official end of the Superior Spider-Man saga. Peter Parker has rightfully reclaimed his body and role as Spider-Man and it is up to him to begin to restore his legacy and right all the wrongs committed by Doctor Octopus during his tenure. This has been a book that has seen the “good” Doctor reconstruct Peter's life in his image, for all the good and bad that came along with those attempts. Doctor Octopus as Spider-Man has committed murder, horribly disfigured several of his enemies, gained a PhD, started Parker Industries, romanced Anna Maria, built Spider-bots, blackmailed J. Jonah Jameson, left the Avengers, imprisoned Black Cat, and alienated Peter Parker's family and loved ones. It has been an incredibly exciting time to be a Spider-Man fan and will be remembered as one of the most daring and successful changes to the Spider-Man formula ever implemented.
I wish I could say the same for how the book ends in Superior Spider-Man #31. Dan Slott has done such a wonderful job building up to a new status quo for Peter Parker to return to, promising wonderful stories as Peter has to face the consequences of Otto's actions, but this issue suggests that the impact on Peter's life will be minimal. In an effort to end Superior Spider-Man as cleanly as possible, issue #31 checks in on almost every party that has been affected by Spider-Man over the past 30 issues. Peter gives these parties an equivalent of an, “I'm sorry…,” or a brief explanation, “I was Doc Ock,” without any really intriguing evidence. In this particular issue these acceptances come off as anti-climactic and unsatisfying from a character standpoint. The lack of consequences, ones that have been presumed throughout the run of Superior Spider-Man, threaten to impact the legacy of the “Superior” era and Doctor Octopus's time as the titular character.
That's not to say that there aren't plenty of fun moments to be had in Superior Spider-Man #31, the return of Peter Parker is just as refreshing as it should be. Peter is back and so is his trademark humor! Dan Slott throws Peter a couple of solid one-liners that are sure to be remembered, particularly the moment when the Goblin realizes that Peter is definitely back in action by just recognizing his bad jokes. In a book about mind-swapping, the differences between Otto and Peter have to be more than just visual, although there is definitely a change in body-language now that Peter is back, and have to be represented through their character and actions. In this regard Superior Spider-Man #31 is a mixed success.
Verbally this is the Peter Parker that I've been waiting to see return, but in his actions he's a bit more brazen and cavalier with the lives of the people he's saving than I'm used to. Perhaps it is a lingering cockiness that has worn off from his experience reliving the life of Doctor Octopus, but his hands-off approach to saving Anna Maria puts too much in the hands of an already compromised character. Just when did he learn about how self-sufficient Anna Maria is?
There is some fun to be had with Peter's lack of memories but given how inconsistently this plot has been handled by Slott over the past several issues these sequences quickly bring up new questions and holes in the logic. This distracts from the fun of having Peter back in the saddle. Peter's repurposing of Otto's technology feels especially rushed; did he just whip up some mini-Spider-bots while he was rushing across the city? At what point does Spider-Man become such a tech-based character so as to actually become Iron Man?
Superior Spider-Man #31 finally reveals the face behind the Green Goblin mask and finds an interesting intersection between the long-rumored (and debunked) argument between Steve Ditko and Stan Lee's initial plans for the character. The reveal isn't necessarily satisfying as a reveal, as the implications of what this character has been doing to the world of Spider-Man are far more interesting than his identity and the changes that have been made to him. More confusing is just how little drama is mined from the final battle between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man, after all this buildup, and how little is made of the enormous change that results to the character after their brief battle.
There was really no way that the Goblin mystery could be revealed and live up to the mystery that has been set up over the Superior Spider-Man story without providing a really shocking and layered plot that has been hinted at over the book's run. There were some clues but not enough to make it shocking or rewarding. What is really unfortunate is that the Goblin pretty much hightails it as soon as he realizes Peter is back. It is a strange character moment for the Goblin, especially given who it turns out to be, and his eventual escape from capture is equally awkward. The future for the character is hinted at and while any concept can yield great stories it is strange to see the character altered so dramatically towards a less interesting characterization.
Guiseppe Camuncoli's depiction of New York City's destruction and work with costumed characters is detailed and beautiful, but still showcases some rushed inking and awkward work with non-costumed characters. When characters are doing superheroics his images are layered, dynamic, and feature intense detail. The backgrounds, on the other hand, often are empty and filled with gradients that make them feel hollow and static. The otherworldly colors don't provide any grounding to the proceedings, but it is nice to see the colors change so dramatically upon Peter's return and the dissolution of the Goblin Nation. When Camuncoli is able to fill in the details in his background he excels and delivers some truly wonderful compositions and arrangements that allow the eye to linger and the pacing of the issue to breathe a bit.
It is strange to see Dan Slott rush so quickly through the proceedings here and never really linger long enough with any of the big moments he's been building towards throughout Superior Spider-Man. The ideas are all strong and groundbreaking in terms of the series but where is the reverence for even his own work on the title. All of these various complaints seem nitpicky and specific but so does the plotting to this issue.
What's really missing here in this final issue of Superior Spider-Man is a grand dramatic arc or emotional payoff. The end sequence featuring Anna Maria and the specter of Doctor Octopus tries to elicit emotion, even referencing the cover to Amazing Spider-Man #50, but feels hollow because of the omission of a character that's been key to Superior Spider-Man. That character is Doctor Otto Gunther Octavius, the character that Superior Spider-Man has asked us to sympathize with and come to an understanding of. In the end, the success of this issue and story all hinges on Otto and his unceremonious departure in Superior Spider-Man #30. Without a proper goodbye in that book or any real dramatic, rational arc, the character portrayal of Dr. Octopus, and thus the series, stumbles over the finish line.
The backup story by Christos Gage is actually quite enjoyable from a writing standpoint and actually introduces real consequences and dramatics into the “Goblin Nation” storyline. In it, Peter is forced to face down his loved ones for the first time since his return and deal with the ramifications of Otto's actions. The drama is well-written and well-reasoned, particularly with Mary Jane and Carlie making really distinct decisions about Peter's role in their lives. Their decisions make sense with how they've been portrayed but Mary Jane's rejection of Peter is just another continuing distinction in how differently she has been portrayed since the “Brand New Day” era began. Gone is the woman who would fight for Peter and in her place is a much more selfish woman. The Jameson sequence finally pays off on a long gestating storyline in a way that is true to his character and serves to deepen and reignite his relationship to Spider-Man in an interesting way. Will Sliney's art is crisp and clear in a way that Camuncoli's art isn't, but for a sequence about characters talking to each other their poses aren't graphic enough and come across as stiff and lifeless. Either way, it is a more dramatic couple of pages than the primary story that preceded it.
So long Superior Spider-Man, you were a ton of fun while you lasted… I just hope you will leave a more lasting impression than this issue implies. Much of this series spent so much time presenting a referendum on what made Peter Parker such a great Spider-Man. We saw it in all of Doctor Octopus's actions and inactions, for both positive and ill gain. Yet, at the end of this series, a time where the thematic idea of Superior Spider-Man should finally become apparent, I couldn't discern what makes the real difference between Peter and Otto as Spider-Man. I know Peter is the “Superior Spider-Man” but this story did not illustrate why and I consider that an enormous missed opportunity.

Superior Spider-Man #31 – REVIEW Dan Gvozden April 17, 2014 6.5 / 10 Superior Spider-Man #31 brings the series to a close with an anti-climatic and rushed finale. After spending so much time building up to this moment, the story rushes through all the inherent dramatic potential in favor of setting up a new status quo for the new title. Still, there is fun to be had from Camuncoli's pencils, Peter's return, and a character-heavy backup story. April 17, 2014
Before we were assigned to the failing body of an old man, before we were playing our own father and before we were forced to be an effeminate blonde with a nagging girlfriend, we were Solid Snake. With the fast approaching Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker for the PSP, we will once again take up the mantle of Big Boss. Because of this dilution of the MGS universe, we sometimes forget to look back and remember the hero we originally came to idolize. He was a take-no-prisoners espionage agent in a blue sneaking suit with a penchant for snapping necks. Solid Snake didn't always go horse yelling “Liquuuiiiid!” No, he used to spend his free time mouthing off to huge Inuits wielding chain guns and assuring us that love can bloom on the battlefield right after he shoots your soul mate with a Nikita missile.
Now I know what you're all thinking, you've already saved the free world from destruction with every variation of Snake there is. Maybe so, but there might have been a little mission you neglected to take part in.
Metal Gear Solid for the Game Boy Color is not a remake; it is a brand-new mission featuring Solid Snake seven years after the events of the first game in a pseudo-alternate timeline. Snake must return to Outer Heaven to stop a new prototype Metal Gear from falling into the hands of a guerrilla separatist group called the Gindra Liberation Front, and it's up to you to guide him through it.
The game itself is played from a top-down perspective much like the original Metal Gear for the NES. Surprisingly, the game manages to bring back almost all of Snake's tricks from the first Playstation's MGS to the foray. You can press yourself against walls, knock on surfaces to distract guards, sneak via cardboard box and all of it is beautifully animated on the 8-bit screen. Even Colonel Cambell and Mei Ling make an appearance. Yes, almost all of Snake's weapons, comrades and techniques are at your disposal in this incarnation of the MGS franchise. The only downside is that all these tricks aren't entirely necessary when the enemy AI is pretty much what you would expect from a Game Boy Color game. You can literally kill a guard while he's having a smoke right next to his partner without alerting anyone. Snake is pretty much breaking into a nursery and punching newborns left and right, but somehow the games intelligently designed levels and traps keep this from becoming an issue.
The game does veer away from the mainstream Metal Gear titles in some aspects. For instance, you cannot backtrack through previously visited areas. Instead, the game is divided into 13 missions which rank you on your performance once completed. Don't worry though; you can relive your favorite moments at any time by selecting a chapter at the mission screen. Speaking of favorite moments, the game sports some of the most bizarre and interesting villains of the MGS series in the form of the oddly familiar Black Chambers, a group of mercenaries with animal codenames. From the creepy serial killer with a love for puppets, Marionette Owl, to the grossly underrated flame-thrower wielding Pyro Bison, you'll find the villains in this game as memorable as any other. At the very least, you'll find them more interesting than the villains from Sons of Liberty… I mean seriously, they had to use half of Guns of the Patriots to make those characters even moderately presentable.
Once you've completed the main story, the game offers a ton of extras. There's new mission objectives for each chapter, 180 puzzling VR mission and a versus mode if you can find a friend who has a Game Boy and link cable. But more importantly it's a return to classic Snake. The one who would taunt his enemies with witty repartee, and although there's obviously no voice acting in this installment, the music and story are of a caliber unseen on many other handheld titles.
So if you're a fan of the Metal Gear series and haven't played MGS for the Game Boy Color, get to your local used game store and find this gem. It's an experience that will remind you of what Snake used to be before we started swapping more characters than Dr. Sam Beckett (Anyone? Quantum Leap? C'mon that was classic). With great 8-bit graphics, an involving story, a surprising good soundtrack and more extras than you can wave an SMG at, you'll be happy you did.

Easy guide to Alcohol – explaining fermentation, distillation and spirits
.
.What do you think of when you hear ‘cocktail'? James Bond and his ‘shaken, not stirred' Martini? Maybe you think of big fruity drinks with small umbrellas, served poolside on a resort holiday? Or (god forbid) Tom Cruise flipping bottles in the famous oh-so 80s movie of the same name?
.
The word cocktail has actually been in use for around 300 years and managed to evolve quite significantly during this time; starting off as the name of one type of mixed drink (“a stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters”, The Balance and Columbian Repository, 1806) it has moved to our more modern use of the word, as a general term that applies to mixed drinks that use distilled alcohol as a main ingredient.
.
Alcohol you say?
.
Yes, alcohol! If we're going to look at cocktails and mixed drinks we first need to understand what exactly we mean by alcohol.
.
Fermentation
.
Let's start at the beginning. The alcohol we use in mixed drinks is Ethyl Alcohol, or ethanol. (Not Methanol! – really, unless you want to be made blind this not a mistake you want to make, so no sipping the white spirit you find in your garage). We can create alcohol through the process of fermentation, which is the name we give to the chemical conversion of sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide by yeast.
.
I'll try to explain this more easily using a simplified example of old-school wine production (as wine making is literally turning grape juice into alcohol).
.
To make wine we press grapes to get grape juice, which contain naturally occurring sugars. Once we have this sugary grape juice we can transfer it into a container, such as a barrel, and the bacteria (yeast) that exists naturally will come along and start to interact with the sugars, eventually converting them into ethyl alcohol (ethanol) and co2 (and, most importantly in this case, wine!). So to put it simply:
“Sugar + yeast + time = alcohol + co2”
(Actual modern wine production is obviously much more complicated and scientific than this but that's not important at the moment)
.
Fermentation allows us to make beer (through the process of brewing malted barley), wine, cider (using the sugar in the apples, pears etc), and similar alcoholic beverages up to an ABV (alcohol by volume) of around 15%, before a number of natural factors come along and stop the process. This is all fine and good, but what if we want something a bit stronger? After all, that bottle of gin in your kitchen cabinet is certainly more than 15% right?
.
That's where distillation comes in.
.
Distillation
.
Distillation is the name of the process that allows us to separate the alcohol we've made through fermentation from the rest of the non-alcoholic liquid. This increases the ABV (from say 15% alcohol to something like 45% alcohol), while also changing the taste, flavour and removing the colour. Continuing with the wine example – if we distil fermented grape juice (wine around 10-15% abv) then we end up with Brandy (at around 40% abv). The more we distil, or the closer we get to pure ethanol, or 100% alcohol, the less of the original flavours from the fermentation remain – we end up with what we call neutral spirit, as it is relatively odourless and flavourless.
.
How can we do this?
.
Water and alcohol have different boiling points. You'll probably remember from science class that at sea level water has a boiling point of 100°c. Alcohol on the hand has a boiling point of approx 78.4°c. This means that if we were to pour a mixture of water and alcohol into a pan and heat it up, the alcohol would boil and turn to vapour before the water, disappearing from our jug (and from our hearts) and into the sky.
.
Luckily for us, over 1000 years ago humans developed basic tools called ‘stills' which can make use of the different boiling points and collect the alcohol vapours instead of letting them fly off into the heavens.
.
The first, and most simple, is the aptly named, Simple Still, or Pot Still.
.
Pot Still
The pot still has two main components – the boiler and the condenser. In the boiler we place our mash (our fermented alcohol), which we then heat up. Once the liquid inside raises in temperature and reaches the boiling point for alcohol, the alcohol will change from liquid to a vapour and rise up through the swan neck and along the pipe into the condenser. As the condenser is not heated the alcohol will start to lower in temperature and eventually change back into a liquid again, and in the process we've now moved the alcohol while leaving (most) of the other liquid behind. There are some other compounds that come along for the ride as well, so distillers will break the liquid into cuts, with the heads and tails being the first and last parts of the distillation that can contain some pretty nasty compounds so need to be discarded. The body, making up around 80% of the total distilate, is what we will actually use.
.
In reality one distillation will usually take us to an ABV somewhere around 25-45%, so in many cases we will do this whole process again (a second distillation) giving us a higher ABV again before we decide whether to bottle our alcohol (with some added water of course!) or rest it in vats or barrels.
.
Column still
.
A pot still is great as it allows us to boost the alcohol while retaining flavour from the original ingredients (remember that as the ABV increases you're basically getting closer and closer to pure ethanol and losing flavour) but it's not the most efficient way as It's very much a stop/start process. Luckily for us around the time of the industrial revolution in the early 1800s the column still, or continuous still was invented. A column still lets us continue to add the mash while the distillation process is taking place, so the still can operate for far longer periods of time.
.
The actual distillation is a little bit more complicated than the pot still but basically how they work is that the still is set up as two large stacks (or columns); one column acts as a still and one as a condenser. The still has a series of bubble plates, basically metal plates with small holes in them. The mash is added from the top and steam is forced in from the bottom. As the mash fights its way down through the holes the steam, moving up, heats the alcohol and seperates it from the mash, which allows us to collect just the alcohol vapors at the top. Through this process we can get really high ABV levels relatively quickly – up to around 96% (effectively making a odourless, flavourless, neutral spirit).
..
Spirits
.
The pot and column stills have allowed us to take our fermented mash and concentrate the alcohol. The result is that we have made spirits. Spirits is the term we use for distilled alcoholic beverages with an ABV >20%, with very little added other than water, colouring or sometimes a very small amount of sugar. You've seen spirits before – regular whiskies, vodkas, rums, brandies are all examples of spirits.
.
Spirits can be made in pot stills (where flavour tends to be more important – whiskeys, cognac and similar), column stills (where we want a more neutral flavour, so vodkas, gins etc) or using both pot and column stills as a blend, for a sort of ‘best of both worlds' approach (getting flavour from the pot still, but bulking it out with the cheaper to produce column distilled alcohol).
.
Adding Flavour to spirits
.
Once our spirit has been distilled there are still a couple of extra ways we can add flavour.
Oak Barrels
.
The most well known method is by storing the alcohol in oak barrels. Originally used as a method of storage and to help with transportation, early distillers noticed that the alcohol they placed in barrels often ended up tasting much better than it had when it was first put in.
.
Alcohol that has been stored in a barrel will take some of the colour of the barrel, so depending on how long it's been stored, will be anywhere from a light, straw yellow to a deep dark brown colour (I should probably also note that many spirits allow colouring to be added to the alcohol so don't always trust what your eyes tell you!). Along with the colour it can take on flavours; if you've tried aged whiskeys, brandies or rums you may notice flavours such as vanilla, or kind of woody, smokey tastes.
.
Different brands will age their liquor for different lengths of time, anywhere up to and over 30 years. Because wood is porous a certain amount of alcohol will evaporate over this time, how much really depends on where the barrels are being stored. Humid conditions (say, rum in the Caribbean) will lose more to evaporation per year than whiskey stored in Scotland, with some producers losing up to 10% per year. This lovely process of losing alcohol is known as the angels share, for reasons I'm sure you can work out.
I'll go more in depth about barrel aging and it's role in specific spirits in later posts.
.
Filtration
Another way we can change the taste of our spirits post-distillation is by filtration. Filtering the alcohol through activated carbon or something similar can help to remove contaminants or impurities that may be left over during the distillation process, but it can also remove some of the very precious taste (oh no!) so you tend to find that filtration is usually done on neutral based spirits, things like vodka or gin, where this isn't so much of a problem.
.
Flavoured Spirits
While they may seem like a new trend people have been flavouring spirits almost as long as they have been distilling them. One of the earliest and most common uses of distilled alcohol was as medicine and it was thought that flavouring alcohol with herbs, berries, flowers and similar could have a positive effect on your health (positive for that time, anyway!).
In terms of more modern products, people are often confused at the difference between flavoured spirits, such as Absolut Vanilla or Bacardi Razz, and liqueurs. The easiest way to think if it is the difference in the amount of sugar – flavoured spirits tend to have no (or very little) added sugar, so you're basically tasting more of the actual spirit while liqueurs are much more heavily… sugared (if that's a word).
.
Also, while liqueurs tend to get their flavouring added to the spirit after distillation, some (but not all) flavoured spirits actually get their flavour during the distillation process, by putting the flavour (whether its raspberry, lemon, whatever) in with the mash during distillation. This gives a softer, and perhaps more subtle flavour than adding in the ingredients post distillation as you would with liqueurs.
.
An example of spirits flavoured during distillation are most good dry gins.
Brands like Beefeater, Bombay Sapphire and the like take neutral spirit (so flavourless, odourless alcohol around 95% abv) and place it in a still along with juniper berries (the main flavour with gin) and other ‘botanicals' (which is a fancy way of saying the ‘other ingredients' in the gin, herbs and spices if you like). They then re-distil the neutral spirit and botanicals and the result, known as distilled gin, is the light, floral smell and taste we see in most of the good brands made today.
.
It's important to understand the difference between flavoured spirits and liqueurs when making drinks as you'll end up with very different drinks if you substitute flavoured spirits for liqueurs, or vice-versa. Experimenting is good; but destroying, not so much!
.
And that's it for spirits! Quite a lot to take in but hopefully it makes some sense; there'll be a follow-up covering liqueurs coming soon so keep an eye out for it (or join the mailing list at the top of the page or like me on Facebook to make sure you don't miss out).

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Tragic end to young owl's 220-mile record flight to Derry from Kerry BelfastTelegraph.co.uk A young barn owl that set a new record for the longest recorded distance travelled by the species in Ireland has been killed. https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/tragic-end-to-young-owls-220mile-record-flight-to-derry-from-kerry-34523441.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/article34523440.ece/2be1a/AUTOCROP/h342/2016-03-09_new_17523397_I1.JPG

A young barn owl that set a new record for the longest recorded distance travelled by the species in Ireland has been killed.
The bird winged its way from Kerry to Londonderry - more than 220 miles as the crow flies and double the distance of any previously recorded barn owl within Ireland.
Unfortunately that incredible journey was to be its last.
The juvenile owl met a tragic end as a road casualty on the Limavady Road and was picked up by Brian Hegarty, a volunteer barn owl fieldworker with Ulster Wildlife.
Barn owls are rare in Northern Ireland, with fewer than 50 pairs left in the wild.
The barn owl was identified by the special metal ring on its leg which revealed it had been fitted as a chick last July, at its nest site near Farranfore, Co Kerry, by John Lusby from BirdWatch Ireland.
"I couldn't quite believe the news when Brian contacted me," John said.
"The bird was one of four chicks that we ringed at a traditional nest site in Kerry in July 2015."

The Borussia Mönchengladbach player is looking forward to this summer's Gold Cup after an encouraging year for club and country
The US is a nation built on immigration, and few groups have shaped the country like the Germans. Hot dogs, Christmas trees, kindergartens, and all that. The migrant story of Ger-merican Fabian Johnson is a different one altogether, at least outside of the US men's national soccer team.
Like all but one of his grandparents, Johnson grew up feeling American. His dad, a basketballer of note, had put his life on the line to fight for the country's armed forces. They spoke English at home and presumably celebrated Thanksgiving come November. Yet until a few years ago, when the opportunity to play in the top tier of German football took him to Wolfsburg, he had never lived outside of Munich.
The American diaspora rarely gets spoken of, and its story is dwarfed by that of American immigration. But it is real. The country's influence on the world is so great - culturally, economically, and, as in this case, militarily - that even if some can't place their beloved homeland on a globe, they can rest assured that there are Americans all over it.
Johnson's maternal grandmother was a Bavarian; her husband was a recent arrival there from the States. The pattern would be repeated when their daughter met an American soldier stationed in Germany around the end of the Cold War.
There must have been some celebrating going on when the Iron Curtain was pegged back and the threat of World War III lifted, judging from the USMNT team sheet. Johnson is one of around six players whose parents met the same way. Those relationships didn't always work out as well it did for the Johnsons, who stayed together in Munich, Germany's second biggest city, where Fabian was born and raised.
“I always feel quite American, I just grew up in Germany,” he says in an accent that is ‘international' more than anything specific. English might have been the lingua franca at home, but he carries few of his dad's Michiganisms. “Almost my whole family is still in Munich. It's kind of home for me.”
The elder Johnson passed on his athletic genes to Fabian, though it was a gift that took them in very different directions. Whereas Fabian spent his youth at 1860 Munich, his dad had played for local rival, Bayern Munich. The basketball team, that is. “Yeah, but at this time, their basketball wasn't as good as it is now,” Fabian says. “I think they were in the third or fourth league, or something like this. Now they are in the first league. It's not the same.”
It's common in Germany, and elsewhere in continental Europe, for football to be just one of many sports a club fields teams in. Bayern, for instance, even have a chess team. “Yeah, it's crazy, huh.”
It was football, not basketball or chess, where the young Fabian got his break. His big brother, who he stuck with like a shadow, taught him more about the game than his dad could, though he learned plenty from him too.
“My dad always just gave me advice, like listen to your coach, do what he says and not get into like too many troubles,” he says with a cheeky grin. He also showed him the importance of developing both feet, and helped to carve the neural pathways that have made Fabian as effective on his left as he is on his right. It means he rarely plays in the same position for club and country these days (though, for the record, he likes the consistency of being a left midfielder, where he spends most weeks for Borussia Mönchengladbach.)
At 1860, Johnson progressed from ball boy to a member of their senior outfit, which plays in Germany's second division. From 16 onwards, he was part of Germany's national youth teams and won the European Under 21 championship with them in 2009.
Breaking in to the German national team was another thing altogether. At that stage of his career, his versatility was yet to be fully recognised, and he was competing for the right-back position with Philipp Lahm, the man who would lift the World Cup in Rio de Janeiro last year.
His move to Wolfsburg didn't help his cause. The team was enjoying unprecedented success, and there was little space for the budding Johnson, no matter what his talent or potential. In two seasons, he played little more than a dozen games there.
Everything changed with a switch to Hoffenheim, where regular game time led to international attention, even if it was a little out of left-field.
“Good evening, I just wanted to ask you: can you imagine to play for the US?”
Johnson remembers Jürgen Klinsmann's first words to him well. He almost choked on his dinner when the call came.
“At first I couldn't believe it, because Jürgen is quite a legend [but] I was quite excited, and I said ‘Yes, of course.'” After hanging out with the side for a week in LA, his mind was made up. “There was a good vibe, everything was perfect. And, yeah, I made the switch.”
While some in the US have questioned Klinsmann's recruiting of so many dual-citizen players, it's the Germans who could have felt most aggrieved, having spent years on Johnson's development. But the player says there was never any resentment towards him, just lots of goodwill.
“I think most of the people were just happy about it, that I took the chance to play for the US. They were just trying to support me however they can.”
It's a team which survived the group of death in Brazil last year and then resisted Belgium for the best part of 120 minutes. The focus now is on defending the Gold Cup on home soil this summer.
First though, Johnson has to get Gladbach, who he signed with in the off-season, into the Champions League. They are battling for third spot on the Bundesliga table (although second is a distinct possibility too), a finish that would give them Germany's last automatic spot in next season's European competition.
“The first half of this season was quite hard [for me], because I just came right off the World Cup, and I had no pre-season. But right now I'm doing pretty good after the winter break, so I try to keep going and stay healthy.”
A rare victory for free speech in Canada. Gregory Alan Elliott, the Toronto artist who was dragged through an extraordinary 3-year criminal harassment trial after he disagreed with feminists on the internet, has just been acquitted.
Both sides of the online culture wars had their eyes trained on a courtroom in Ontario today, where the long-awaited verdict was just handed down. The case became a major flashpoint between free speech defenders and feminists on the internet. At stake were two separate visions of the internet – one free, and one closely policed by progressive activists.
Elliott was charged with criminal harassment after he tweeted a number of critical messages to feminist activist Stephanie Guthrie in 2012. He has incurred several hundred thousand dollars in debt over the course of the legal battle, and has even had his artwork vandalized by progressive activists.
The case was the first time someone has been charged with harassment for tweets in Canada, and will set a legal precedent. Breitbart Tech viewed the case as a clear-cut free speech issue from the beginning, with our editor recently lending his efforts to support the Elliott family's legal fundraiser. Dubbed “Freedom of Tweets,” the campaign raised over $50,000 for Elliott's legal fund.
Speaking to Breitbart Tech on the morning of the trial, Gregory's son Clayton had a hopeful attitude. “I'm feeling optimistic. I've sat through every day in court, I've listened to every argument, and even though I'm still amazed it went on this long, it's hard to imagine him being found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”
It turns out Clayton was right, and that even in Canada, sanity can prevail. Expect more analysis on this landmark case later today.

A month and a half ago, we posted a story about ex-BD writer Zac Thompson's body horror novel “Weaponized“. One of the big reasons we wanted to let you all know about it is because we want to honor and showcase what our ex-writers do but also because if Zac sold the most orders of his book out of everyone else involved, then he would get a chance to have his book adapted into a film from Crypt TV and Blumhouse!
It turns out that our support as well as the massive outpouring of help from his friends and other websites not only gave Zac a chance, it catapulted him to the number one slot on Inkshares and ensured that his book will be published and distributed in all major bookstores as well as Amazon and other online retailers. But more importantly, it means that Blumhouse and Crypt TV will now be eyeing his book as well as the #2 and #3 titles for a possible movie production.
Because we want Zac to succeed, we ask that people share this post and make it be known that you want his story to become a movie. After all, with some serious elements of Clive Barker and David Cronenberg thrown into the story, how could you not envision a film being something twisted, violent, erotic, and absolutely disturbing?
““It Follows meets Tokyo Gore Police”. After losing his virginity to a stranger, a confident but naïve gay teen contracts an STI that causes his flesh to transform into a living gun.”
If you're interested in reading “Weaponized”, it has currently been discounted on Inkshares, so digital copies are only $6.99 while a paperback option is $13.99. You can pick up your copy right here.
Some artists reject equating their personal lives with their artistic ones. In the tradition of the most magnificent women in soul, Mary J. Blige has always invited it, freely discussing her travails and liberally exploring them within her songs, no matter how cutting. Yet on Strength of a Woman, ardent followers might find it jarring that the R&B diva should once again find a reason to look within for affirmation, at age 46 as she does on her 13th album's luminous, boom-bap opening track “Love Yourself.” After a career peppered with songs detailing her abusive relationships and substance addiction, she appeared to find a plateau, a lane where she finally uncovered the happiness she deserved. My Life II...The Journey Continues (Act 1) (2011), closed the chapter on those tumultuous years, untethering her enough that she could—on part of 2014's acclaimed The London Sessions—finally manifest as the classic house diva she deserved to be—free and exultant, unburdened by BPMs.
Wounds reopen, though. Blige is currently embroiled in an acrimonious split from her longtime manager/husband Kendu Isaacs—the source, fans presumed, of much of that early happiness—and so Strength of a Woman finds its power in going back to basics. As a whole experience, it luxuriates within the magisterial hip-hop-soul queendom she formulated in the '90s and the attendant themes that trace back to wronged-woman blues. The bulk of the arrangements, by DJ Camper, hover in the realm of classic soul with slow-jam sensibilities, leaving space for her warm, inimitable relatable voice to speak her truth.
Strength of a Woman's classicism is, in some ways, a relief despite the success of The London Sessions' more modern tracks; in an era of young R&B acts that bury their vocals in hazy, gossamer production to the detriment of cohesion, it's refreshing to hear Blige sticking with what she knows. Mary will never not be Mary, and through the deep-dive into self-empowerment and, as ever, self-discovery, that is this album, she understands her voice is her most effective tool—and her emotion its understudy. “I've been broken for a long time, now I'm standing in the sunshine” she intones radiantly over a simple piano accompaniment on “Smile.” The magic in Blige's music has always been in her ability to transform straightforward, would-be schmaltzy sentiment into universal truths, and here she does that magically, perhaps more fully invested in actualization than she's ever been. While newer R&B fans might not be drawn to the stoicism Blige embraces, particularly those who gravitated towards her via Disclosure, it's inarguable that she's set the template younger faves want to emulate; in an era of musical confessionalism, Blige's instinct has always been the most confessional of all.
That said, Blige is never far from the culture at its most current. Just like rappers will sing, so too will Blige rap; on hyper-dense verses in triple-time cadences, her antipathy lives in the rhythm. Aside from “Telling the Truth,” a typically clanging club track produced by Kaytranada, she is at her most indulgent and delicious on the “Glow Up” featuring Quavo and Missy Elliott, a gleaming revenge track in which she declares herself petty in a Migos flow—“I'm going to glow up! Throw it in ya face like yeahhhh”—and vows to stunt on a spurned lover; Kendu, we presume.
On Strength, Blige's soon-to-be ex-husband (or his avatar) is the equivalent of a cartoon villain, both centered as the antagonist in Blige's betrayed dirges and merely serving as a plot point in the ones that chat chart her own growth through the break-up; to that point this is precisely what a Mary J. Blige album has always been, a document of a woman facing and subsequently never succumbing to her obstacles, all combatted with gritty trills and not-quite-perfect vibrato that mirrors her not-quite-perfect truth. She has never been the most precise singer and thus she is the exact right person to deliver such apparently intimate missives from the soul. Vocally, there's nary a chirp, even in her soprano—just a conjuring deep in the diaphragm. It manifests as she is, what you hear is what you get.
